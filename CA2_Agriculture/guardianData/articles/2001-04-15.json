But Fulham's players, who did not allow themselves even a sniff of the barmaid's apron after this victory restored them to the top flight after a 33-year wait, are looking far beyond the point required against Sheffield Wednesday to make them champions. Assuming they manage it - and that is not taking much for granted - it would be easy for them to showboat through the rest of the season, counting down the days to the visits of Liverpool, Arsenal and, of course, Chelsea next season. But Lee Clark, who helped Sunderland achieve a Nationwide First Division record points haul of 105 two years ago, said: \"Our first goal is to win the title and then to beat that record. If we can do that, it will tell us that we should be good enough to compete at the highest level. \"Sunderland went straight back down after winning promotion through the play-offs in 1997 but the side were much more confident after our achievements two years ago.\" Clark was also a key player in Newcastle's title romp in 1992-93 under Kevin Keegan, the first season of the new First Division.

But, for all Fulham's pretty football, which ended in a stream of almost comical missed chances, it was not until the 85th minute that Boa Morte slipped home a delightful winner after the Huddersfield keeper Nico Vaesen's Barthez-style rush outside his area.

Tory councillors at South Lakeland district council claim that, if the crisis comes to an end around the beginning of June, their authority could have used up around \u00a32m of its \u00a311.2m annual budget. In their response to a survey carried out by the Conservative Party, South Lakeland councillors claimed they were already laying off part-time and seasonal staff. They said: \"Unless the government can give the 100% rate relief for the business community, we are looking at a serious financial problem.\" Much of the cost will come from providing business rate relief to local businesses affected by the outbreak - authorities must make up between 5% and 25% of the bill. The Local Government Association (LGA) and the Tories are both calling for the government to meet the full costs, but the Treasury is resistant. It hopes to maintain an incentive for councils to confine the rate break to badly affected businesses. Tory environment spokesman Damian Green said: \"Conservatives have called on the government to introduce a business rate holiday for firms in badly hit areas, with 100% rate relief funded by central government rather than local taxpayers.\" Carlisle city council has also been hard hit by the crisis, and Tory councillors claim the costs of rate relief, advice centres and accommodating agriculture ministry officials could reach \u00a3250,000 - 5% of the city's council tax income. Oxfordshire said it has lost \u00a3120,000 because it was forced to close educational residential centres, and East Devon district council faces a soaring bill for cleaning beaches, as dog owners switch to the shoreline instead of fields. The LGA is pushing ministers to provide more emergency funding for councils if this kind of additional cost reaches significant levels. The Tories claim that the costs, taken together, will force up next year's council tax bills.",

Indeed, Labour says it intends to reverse the current balance between the state and private sector so that in future the private sector makes up 60% of all pension provision, compared to its 40% share now. The Blair government calls this a new partnership. Individuals take greater responsibility for their financial well-being in later life by saving more in private pension schemes. </p> <p> This privatisation is risky both for the individual considering buying into a stakeholder pension and for society at large. </p> <p> Choosing the right pension for your circumstances is complex. There are now at least seven distinct vehicles for providing income in later life. Stakeholder pensions increase this choice without making provision for better advice; it is likely more people will end up with the wrong sort. At first sight the 1% cap on charges levied by companies offering stakeholder pensions works in favour of the consumer. But it gives pension companies scant incentive to make advice available at a time when people are in need of more information than ever. They have already begun to lay off their direct-sales teams.</p> <p> It is difficult to plan for events such as the needs of children or older relatives, unemployment and early retirement. Things happen that may make a stakeholder pension a bad savings vehicle. People might be better off remaining in the state system or putting their money into an ISA, which offers more flexible access to savings. </p> <p> People may not be able to contribute enough to their stakeholder pensions to make them worthwhile. The table estimates how much you would need to save from a given age in order to secure a weekly income. It assumes a 3% real rate of return and 6% annuity rate. Focus on that \u00a330 a week figure. Gordon Brown has increased the generosity of the minimum income guarantee for older people (MIG) - but by doing so the government has ensured that more and more will find themselves dependent on the state in later life. </p> <p>Currently, to avoid making a claim on the means-tested MIG would require a stakeholder pension income of at least \u00a330 a week. By 2060, this figure is more likely to be in the region of \u00a3100 (in current prices). That means a person who saves continuously from the age of 25 would need to put aside approximately \u00a322 a week to achieve such an income. Delaying this decision is going to be costly - the required amount of savings rises to \u00a362 a week for those who save for only 20 years. Are such levels of saving realistic? Stakeholder pensions are meant for those on low and modest incomes, with the typical case taken to be someone with annual earnings of \u00a312,000. At this level, a 25-year-old would need to contribute 9.5% of gross earnings, the 35-year-old 15%. A 45-year-old would need to contribute more than a quarter (27%) of gross earnings to make a stakeholder pension worthwhile. Spending today and relying on the state tomorrow might be a more attractive choice.</p> <p> Taking out a stakeholder pension also exposes individuals to risks related to the City's performance. You may be unfortunate in the choice of provider, as Equitable Life policy-holders have found. Pension companies may invest in poorly performing shares or you may retire on a day the stock market takes a downturn. </p> <p>The fact that those with a stakeholder pension, just like those with other forms of private pension, are obliged to purchase an annuity adds another form of risk. Annuity rates fluctuate widely. In 1990 a pension pot of \u00a3100,000 would have purchased an annual income of \u00a311,000. Today the same amount will produce just \u00a36,000. Annuities are calculated according to predicted life expectancy: because women live longer on average, they receive a lower income for their pension pot. The current sex differential in annuity rates means that women need a pension pot between one-fifth and one-sixth higher than men in order to achieve the same income. But interrupted working lives and lower earnings mean women are less able to build up pension savings. </p> <p> Taken as a whole, these risks will have important consequences for the level of income and welfare enjoyed by the older population. As the basic state pension declines in real value over time, additional pensions will have to work harder to fill the gap. Individual welfare will increasingly depend on the pension pot you personally accumulate. The scope for redistributing between rich and poor, men and women, employed and unemployed is reduced as we shift further towards private provision. As a consequence, inequalities in working life will be perpetuated into later life. </p> <p> State pension systems were originally conceived of as a mechanism for pooling risk, and spreading its consequences across society as a whole. A pay-as-you-go pension system is effectively a government promise based on the tax money of those not yet born. Privatisation of pensions substitutes this promise for that of returns from the financial markets. Striking the right balance between public and private depends upon how you view the trade-off between the risks of financial bad weather and those of political u-turns.

Even if Cojocaru never dances this well again she'll be written into the books as one of the rare talents of the ballet stage.</p> <p>Describing her performance one might wish there were a sweetie jar of superlatives reserved for the event, except that Cojocaru has a simplicity that resists gaudiness and gush. She doesn't flaunt the dextrous dazzle of Sylvie Guilleme, performing hyperbolic feats of virtuosity that can jigger up a whole audience; nor does she move with the lovely, reckless physicality of Darcey Bussell. Even though she's only 19, she opens herself up to the music and the choreography as if she were their special instrument.</p> <p>Physically, the qualities that make Cojocaru's Giselle outstanding are ones her fans have already registered. Her tiny body moves with precocious speed, scale and assurance, which allow her to glide over the surface of most technical challenges, while she has an instinct for music that takes her deep inside the logic of a given role. In Act One of Giselle she dances with a peculiar artless intensity - blown about by the lilting energy of her steps. In Act Two she is sustained and exquisite. We don't register individual moves so much as the steady rising arc of her whole interpretation.</p> <p>For such a junior dancer, this displays a startling maturity; yet it's Cojocaru's youth that clinches her current interpretation. Though she doesn't register as a gifted actress - the way Sarah Wildor does, for instance - she communicates emotion with a shocking lack of guile. Her mad scene features details of mime that might be edited out, except that her body looks so broken with pain you're not even sure she's acting. She conveys Giselle's love for Albrecht with a tenderness that grows into an ache. </p> <p>Johan Kobborg as Albrecht looks as bemused and entranced as we feel, but he must also take wads of credit for Cojocaru's performance. He is almost as unguarded and hungry as she is and his partnering is so musical it allows her to fly. </p> <p>Romantic ballet of the 19th century spawned a whole critical poetic - sublime, misty, soft as thistledown - which has become cobwebby with age.

Though she doesn't register as a gifted actress - the way Sarah Wildor does, for instance - she communicates emotion with a shocking lack of guile. Her mad scene features details of mime that might be edited out, except that her body looks so broken with pain you're not even sure she's acting. She conveys Giselle's love for Albrecht with a tenderness that grows into an ache. Johan Kobborg as Albrecht looks as bemused and entranced as we feel, but he must also take wads of credit for Cojocaru's performance. He is almost as unguarded and hungry as she is and his partnering is so musical it allows her to fly. Romantic ballet of the 19th century spawned a whole critical poetic - sublime, misty, soft as thistledown - which has become cobwebby with age. Kobborg and Cojocaru blow away the dust. \u0095 In rep until May 16. Box office: 020-7304 4000.",

The Brazilian, who has added another nine goals in the competition this season, including qualifiers, refused to play in the domestic league recently in protest at late payment of players' wages - another symptom of the crisis at the club. </p> <p>But he cannot resist a humdinger of a European challenge, and scored the winning goal that gives the Uefa Cup holders their advantage in the Bernabeu on Wednesday. Yet so unhappy is he about his club's financial squeeze that he is expected to seek a new employer in the summer. Benfica, Milan, and Olympique Marseille want him. </p> <p>Money is a source of huge frustration to the Turkish flagbearers, who have seen all their cosmic plans to turn Gala into an international superclub stymied by the economic problems afflicting the country. Last autumn their potential seemed limitless as they sold $20 million of stock to an American company that also owns Vasco de Gama in Brazil, planned to increase their war chest by floating on the stock exchange and were preparing to build a swanky new stadium.

For Kalpakcioglu, a US-certified accountant whose grandfather was one of the club's three founders, the opportunity to revive his club's ambitious vision cannot come quickly enough: 'Our objectives are sufficient to catch Manchester United financially in the short term, within four to five years,' he boasts. </p> <p>Given that Gala claim to have 16 million supporters worldwide, and to be the only Muslim club performing in a top international arena (their matches are televised in parts of Africa, the former Soviet Union, the Middle East, and even the Far East), they are convinced of their vast potential. </p> <p>So aggressively do they aim to catch up with the Manchesters, Milans and Madrids that their plans to construct a new home are dominated by finance rather than fervour. For Galatasaray, whose present stadium can, at a squeeze, pack in 30,000, this looks a dangerous gamble. They employed a London firm to make an independent feasibility study, and somehow they came up with the idea that fans in Istanbul would be happy to pay the equivalent of \u00a318 for a match ticket (five times the price of the cheapest admission at the moment), and so decided to build a 40,000 all-seat stadium with premium-priced tickets rather than a 100,000 arena with admission prices affordable to the masses . </p> <p>It seems the notorious 'Welcome to Hell' mentality that makes the Ali Sami Yen such a hostile place to visit (just ask Leeds United) will be replaced by a wealthy clientele munching prawns in pitta bread. Some clubs who have encountered violent problems with Galatasaray fans will think that is no bad thing. </p> <p>It will be some time before we discover how much the face of Cimbom, as the faithful call their club, will change. While they wait for the Turkish economy to stabilise, they will be forced to cash in on their most coveted stars. The dazzling homegrown prodigy Emre Belozoglu - described by Italy's sports newspaper Tuttosport as the most sought-after player in Europe - and his best friend and midfield partner Okan Buruk have reportedly struck a deal to join Inter. Typically for Gala, it's not straightforward. The two clubs haven't agreed a fee, so this move, too. will go to Fifa for arbitration. </p> <p>Jardel's agent may have denied his client will be leaving but his discontent ought to cause a stampede around Europe, and Galatasaray will be hard pressed to say no, given his crippling wages of about \u00a32 million a year. For the benefit of both club and player, a summer move looks certain. Signing him in the first place for \u00a322m was a huge deal by Turkish standards (even if it was bankrolled by the owner of the mobile phone company and club sponsor Telcim). Amazingly, Gala were the only club to come up with a concrete offer, and he has rewarded them by scoring for fun, as you would expect from a marksman who claimed 150 goals from 145 games at his previous club, Porto. Jardel's stock, if anything, has increased through his efforts in difficult circumstances in Istanbul. </p> <p>'It's a miracle to have achieved the Champions League quarter-finals in these conditions,' remarked Romanian coach Lucescu. The key, according to veteran and volatile playmaker Georghe Hagi, is simply down to the team's quality. Having hoisted the Uefa Cup and European Super Cup in the past year, Hagi expects them to go one better now: 'We're at the peak of our game, we're in great shape, we will play in the final. A year ago we knocked out Milan, this year we'll play the final on their home turf. It's destiny, it's pre-ordained.' </p> <p>Hagi is due to hang up those mercurial boots and rest that mad temperament at the end of the season, so you can't blame him for envisaging a fantasy finale, however dubious the logic. </p> <p>That fantasy could yet become a nightmare if Gala do get through_ and face Leeds United. Memories of the murders of two supporters from Leeds in Istanbul are still painfully vivid. </p> <p>For the moment, the Galatasaray players will not concern themselves with that and Hagi, banned from domestic action for spitting at a referee who dared to disallow one of his goals (an official he later accused of being a thief) should be available. </p> <p>Meanwhile, money man Kalpakcioglu will be back in Istanbul while the players try to earn a lucrative semi-final place against Bayern Munich or Manchester United. 'I am superstitious and I believe I bring bad luck to my team,' he admitted. 'I watched the Uefa Cup final in my summer house outside Istanbul. I just couldn't take it. And I believe we'll have success in Madrid and make the semi-final. It will be fun.' </p> <p>It would also be a much needed money-spinner, and a momentous achievement against all the odds.</p>",

So the game has changed unrecognisably? Indeed it has. </p> <p>Television and all-seat stadia have seen to that. It is just that the alarmists haven't. A report last week by the analysts Deloitte and Touche showing that the 20 Premiership clubs made a collective loss of \u00a334.5 million last season, with wages the most significant factor and the average player earning \u00a38,000 a week, has been seized upon as a sign that 'football's bubble has burst'. </p> <p>It seems the English game, like the theatre and the modern novel, is permanently in decline. The burst-bubble comment, incidentally, came from a club chairman, quoted anonymously in the wake of the report. Well he would say that, wouldn't he? Those upstart players, the hired hands, need reminding that they can't hold his club to ransom - unless he is Italian, a bit of a maverick, shifts replica shirts and scores five goals a season. 'Our club are doing all right,' added the chairman, by way of qualification, so we can safely assume that the man being quoted was not Chelsea's Ken Bates.</p> <p>His debt-riddled club top the wages league, their annual bill having climbed 56 per cent to more than \u00a347m. And Chelsea have not enjoyed the most successful of seasons after sacking Gianluca Vialli. The word Schadenfreude no doubt springs readily to the lips of fans elsewhere. The report's findings, based on last season's figures, make interesting reading, the least of it the confirmation that money does indeed buy success. Below Chelsea came Manchester United, the pair of them the winners of the two main domestic prizes last season. At the other end, relegated Watford increased their salaries by 60 per cent but were still the lowest payers after Bradford City. No longer dispensers of chickenfeed, the desperately offloading Bantams will doubtlessly have their own wage folly revealed in next season's figures. </p> <p>It also tells us that money does not necessarily buy success. Newcastle United and Middlesbrough are hefty payers, due to the difficulties of attracting foreign signings to the North East. But then London clubs pay well because of property prices and the cost of the Scandinavian iced berries with white chocolate sauce at The Ivy. The middling payers are in the Midlands. What do fans care? Not a lot if the player is genuinely worth it. Manchester United fans will worry not a jot if David Beckham becomes that first \u00a3100,000-a-week player. The problem comes in the sums being paid to average imports. For too long, the Premiership has been the soft touch of Europe, some teams packed with players rejected or discarded by the better leagues but still earning huge sums. More likely, the report is a warning shot across the game's bows. </p> <p>The boom in wages has been down to the effect of the Bosman ruling and the new transfer regulations. With less going in fees and therefore players likely to see more of the available money themselves, wages are likely to continue to rise. In addition, there have been reports that replica shirts are no longer the fashion items they were, with sales decreasing. Then there is sponsorship, with the Premier League having trouble finding the \u00a315m a season it wants, and television. Pay-per-view is stubbornly refusing to provide another pot of gold. And although Sky will next season pay some \u00a325m to each club as part of the new deal, after that, ITV and BBC could well be priced out of the market, leaving Sky free to offer less for the next contract. It is hardly likely to mean the game going bust here, however. </p> <p>For all their profligacy and complacency at times, the Premiership clubs are some way short of Real Madrid in the debt stakes. And there are few banks brave enough to endure the attendant publicity that comes with foreclosing on a community's football club. It is more likely - you can only hope - that the game will start to re-examine its priorities. Manchester United showed the way a decade ago, when they introduced a clutch of kids from their youth programme and the result has been astonishingly apparent. Their problem now is more that they might need a summer of spending on top overseas players to freshen a squad now in danger of falling behind in European competition, but it remains a mystery why more English clubs have not followed their example. </p> <p>Ipswich Town and Charlton Athletic have also shown how to play attrac tive, and successful, football by using management and coaching expertise to blend promising young, home-developed players with talents perceptively recruited from the Nationwide League and shrewd, less overpriced overseas signings. How is it that Ipswich saw the Premiership potential in Marcus Stewart at Huddersfield, while Aston Villa had to go to Argentina to pay \u00a39.5 million for the labouring Juan Pablo Angel? Soon, if not already, all the youth academies should be turning out young English players of the required standard. </p> <p>If the cost of giving them a fling, and also being forced to look again at players in the lower divisions - then taking a chance and turning them into better players with an improved quality of coaching - has been a wages explosion and debt, then it will have been money well spent. In hindsight, none of us believes that the abolition of the maximum wage, even if such clubs as Preston North End and Burnley may disagree, was anything other than justice and meant consequent and subsequent improvement of the game. </p> <p>By the way, for those history students of the game who believe in its cyclical nature, the 1960s turned into a fascinatingly vibrant period following that wages explosion of 40 years ago. In 1962, Ipswich Town won the league and, a year later, Everton became the 'cheque-book champions' after signing Tony Kay - later banned in a betting scandal - for \u00a360,000 from Sheffield Wednesday. Manchester United also bought big, paying a record \u00a3115,000 to bring home Denis Law from Torino.

      "body": "<p>Middlesbrough were not the only team sent into raptures by this result of spectacular proportions. The corks were popping up in Manchester as well. What blessed relief for City, who are spared the misery of giving United their seventh Premiership crown in nine years next weekend. </p> <p>That honour instead falls to Arsenal - already feeling bitter about their inability to have mustered a credible challenge to Old Trafford. Bad enough to hand them the silver. Worse still to do it courtesy of a ludicrous afternoon of mishaps to take the breath away. Two own goals in four shocking first-half minutes destroyed the Premiership's only unbeaten home record. </p> <p>That is to take nothing away from Boro, for whom three precious and unexpected points should see them well on the way to safety. What a memorable day for one of Old Trafford's favourite sons, Bryan Robson. He could not have done it without Terry Venables, who was right to applaud his team and their ecstatic following at the final whistle. Their application could not be faulted. </p> <p>Middlesbrough, who earned themselves some Premiership breathing space since hiring Venables, had slipped back into perilously deep relegation waters and knew that a win here- something which has eluded them since before the war - would be priceless. Forced to withstand red pressure for the first half hour, during which Kanu and Thierry Henry went close, they required a touch of inspiration from somewhere to provide them with a glimmer of hope. </p> <p>It came from South America. Not Colombian striker Hamilton Ricard, but the two Brazilians in Arsenal shirts. What a bizarre contribution from Edu, whose first home start had been eagerly awaited after his arrival was delayed for six months for his passport hold-up to be resolved. With his career in England so ill-fated thus far, Lady Luck grimaced at him once again. Dean Windass's blast of the right foot - which David Seaman appeared to have covered - ricocheted off Edu to produce an unstoppable own goal which squeezed inside the near post. </p> <p>It was a huge setback for the Patrick Vieira-Edu axis, a partnership Ars\u00e8ne Wenger hopes will emulate the midfield connection Arsenal's Mr Influential enjoyed with his compatriot Emmanuel Petit, and the left-footed playmaker was put out of his misery at half-time, replaced by Sylvain Wiltord. </p> <p>His compatriot Silvinho must have felt sorry for him but took empathy a step too far. Staggeringly, unbelievably, the left-back replicated his friend's error by lashing Dean Gordon's driven cross past a shellshocked Seaman four minutes later. </p> <p>The visitors from Teesside tucked into a corner of the Clock End were delirious. It was extraordinary, so ridiculous that even some Arsenal fans could see the funny side. 'It's just like watching Brazil,' was one sarcastic verdict. </p> <p>Wenger had resisted the temptation to rest key personnel with Tuesday's moment of European truth in Valencia in mind. Six changes were made to the supposedly weakened side which performed so clinically at Manchester City, but he - and indeed the Spanish scouts - could never have expected the full-strength version to self-destruct in such spectacular fashion. </p> <p>Thirteen minutes into the second half Boro finally scored a goal of their own, and beautifully constructed it was too. Windass knocked the ball towards the irrepressible Alen Boksic, whose stylish back-heel eluded Tony Adams's lunge and fell for the onrushing Ricard. With cool precision he swept the ball past Seaman. 'We want four,' bellowed the Riversiders, who have endured their torrid moments this season. Superbly organised and highly motivated, they thoroughly deserved this momentous result - even if they had significant help along the way. </p> <p>Arsenal have a job on to lift themselves for a massive European challenge at the Mestalla Stadium. Any more freakish performances like this could jeopardise their current runners-up place, a passport to next season's Champions League. While others celebrate, Arsenal have some serious thinking to do.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Middlesbrough were not the only team sent into raptures by this result of spectacular proportions. The corks were popping up in Manchester as well. What blessed relief for City, who are spared the misery of giving United their seventh Premiership crown in nine years next weekend. That honour instead falls to Arsenal - already feeling bitter about their inability to have mustered a credible challenge to Old Trafford. Bad enough to hand them the silver. Worse still to do it courtesy of a ludicrous afternoon of mishaps to take the breath away. Two own goals in four shocking first-half minutes destroyed the Premiership's only unbeaten home record. That is to take nothing away from Boro, for whom three precious and unexpected points should see them well on the way to safety. What a memorable day for one of Old Trafford's favourite sons, Bryan Robson. He could not have done it without Terry Venables, who was right to applaud his team and their ecstatic following at the final whistle. Their application could not be faulted. Middlesbrough, who earned themselves some Premiership breathing space since hiring Venables, had slipped back into perilously deep relegation waters and knew that a win here- something which has eluded them since before the war - would be priceless. Forced to withstand red pressure for the first half hour, during which Kanu and Thierry Henry went close, they required a touch of inspiration from somewhere to provide them with a glimmer of hope. It came from South America. Not Colombian striker Hamilton Ricard, but the two Brazilians in Arsenal shirts. What a bizarre contribution from Edu, whose first home start had been eagerly awaited after his arrival was delayed for six months for his passport hold-up to be resolved. With his career in England so ill-fated thus far, Lady Luck grimaced at him once again. Dean Windass's blast of the right foot - which David Seaman appeared to have covered - ricocheted off Edu to produce an unstoppable own goal which squeezed inside the near post. It was a huge setback for the Patrick Vieira-Edu axis, a partnership Ars\u00e8ne Wenger hopes will emulate the midfield connection Arsenal's Mr Influential enjoyed with his compatriot Emmanuel Petit, and the left-footed playmaker was put out of his misery at half-time, replaced by Sylvain Wiltord. His compatriot Silvinho must have felt sorry for him but took empathy a step too far. Staggeringly, unbelievably, the left-back replicated his friend's error by lashing Dean Gordon's driven cross past a shellshocked Seaman four minutes later. The visitors from Teesside tucked into a corner of the Clock End were delirious. It was extraordinary, so ridiculous that even some Arsenal fans could see the funny side. 'It's just like watching Brazil,' was one sarcastic verdict. Wenger had resisted the temptation to rest key personnel with Tuesday's moment of European truth in Valencia in mind. Six changes were made to the supposedly weakened side which performed so clinically at Manchester City, but he - and indeed the Spanish scouts - could never have expected the full-strength version to self-destruct in such spectacular fashion. Thirteen minutes into the second half Boro finally scored a goal of their own, and beautifully constructed it was too. Windass knocked the ball towards the irrepressible Alen Boksic, whose stylish back-heel eluded Tony Adams's lunge and fell for the onrushing Ricard. With cool precision he swept the ball past Seaman. 'We want four,' bellowed the Riversiders, who have endured their torrid moments this season. Superbly organised and highly motivated, they thoroughly deserved this momentous result - even if they had significant help along the way. Arsenal have a job on to lift themselves for a massive European challenge at the Mestalla Stadium. Any more freakish performances like this could jeopardise their current runners-up place, a passport to next season's Champions League. While others celebrate, Arsenal have some serious thinking to do.",

      "body": "<p>The millionaires of Chelsea were given a run for their money by the rather less lavishly-paid journeymen of Southampton before winning this battle of Stamford Bridge, which could take the Blues back into Europe. </p> <p>With both sides going into this game with hopes of qualification for the Uefa Cup, the points were always likely to be hard fought for. </p> <p>Although Chelsea looked well on their way when Gus Poyet put them ahead shortly before half-time, they had to scrap for the rest of the game as Southampton pushed them close, before falling to a third successive defeat. </p> <p>Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri admitted this week that he would love to have more Englishmen in his side, but one has to wonder whether they would be heading for Europe without the foreigners. </p> <p>Once again Chelsea lined up with just three English players in their 16-man squad, and it was no surprise that it was an overseas player who opened the scoring. </p> <p>Dennis Wise is Chelsea's top-scoring Englishman, but he is only seventh on their hit list with four goals. Poyet, by contrast, is in double figures and took his total to 11 for the season when he finally broke the deadlock to put his side ahead shortly before half-time. </p> <p>The Uruguayan midfielder volleyed home with a shot that flew up off the turf and down off the underside of the crossbar in the 43rd minute after Mario Melchiot headed down Graeme Le Saux's deep cross. </p> <p>It was tough on Southampton, especially as the move had started with a foul throw from Mario Stanic. The Saints had defended stoutly for the opening 40 minutes, with goalkeeper Paul Jones setting the tone in the second minute when he flew out of his goal to save at the feet of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink after the Dutch striker had been put clean through on goal by Gianfranco Zola. </p> <p>That was the closest Chelsea came to a goal before Poyet's strike, as Dean Richards led the Saints' defence with a stirring performance. </p> <p>But Southampton did not offer much in attack, and it took half an hour before they created a real chance, Kevin Davies playing a neat one-two with Jo Tessem before shooting over the bar from the edge of the penalty area. </p> <p>They were unlucky five minutes into the second half when James Beattie got his head to Jason Dodd's deep cross but watched the ball rebound off the inside of the far post. That came just moments after Dan Petrescu had prevented his former side from increasing their lead, the Romanian midfielder clearing Marcel Desailly's header off the line. </p> <p>But Petrescu was guilty of a glaring miss later when he ran clear of Chelsea's attempted offside trap but, instead of shooting past Carlo Cudicini or taking the ball round him, attempted a lofted shot from 30 yards which went straight to the Italian keeper. </p> <p>Cudicini's compatriot Gianfranco Zola looked to be Chelsea's best hope of another goal, having a penalty appeal turned down when he seemed to be tripped and then having a shot headed away by Richards and a trademark free-kick deflected for a corner. </p> <p>But Southampton always looked dangerous on the break, and as Chelsea began to look more nervous in defence the visitors went for an equaliser, with caretaker manager Stuart Gray sending on Hassan Kachloul, Tahar El Khalej and Uwe Rosler as substitutes. </p> <p>That left Saints exposed in defence, and Jones came to the rescue twice in a minute in the closing stages before his opposite number was again tested. </p> <p>Southampton broke quickly from defence and Cudicini raced out of his area to try to clear from Rosler, but the German striker won the ball before being fouled by Melchiot. Beattie took the free-kick, his shot flying off the defensive wall and just wide of the post. </p> <p>Both sides had chances in a frantic finale, but Chelsea held on to move closer to a European place next season.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The millionaires of Chelsea were given a run for their money by the rather less lavishly-paid journeymen of Southampton before winning this battle of Stamford Bridge, which could take the Blues back into Europe. With both sides going into this game with hopes of qualification for the Uefa Cup, the points were always likely to be hard fought for. Although Chelsea looked well on their way when Gus Poyet put them ahead shortly before half-time, they had to scrap for the rest of the game as Southampton pushed them close, before falling to a third successive defeat. Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri admitted this week that he would love to have more Englishmen in his side, but one has to wonder whether they would be heading for Europe without the foreigners. Once again Chelsea lined up with just three English players in their 16-man squad, and it was no surprise that it was an overseas player who opened the scoring. Dennis Wise is Chelsea's top-scoring Englishman, but he is only seventh on their hit list with four goals. Poyet, by contrast, is in double figures and took his total to 11 for the season when he finally broke the deadlock to put his side ahead shortly before half-time. The Uruguayan midfielder volleyed home with a shot that flew up off the turf and down off the underside of the crossbar in the 43rd minute after Mario Melchiot headed down Graeme Le Saux's deep cross. It was tough on Southampton, especially as the move had started with a foul throw from Mario Stanic. The Saints had defended stoutly for the opening 40 minutes, with goalkeeper Paul Jones setting the tone in the second minute when he flew out of his goal to save at the feet of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink after the Dutch striker had been put clean through on goal by Gianfranco Zola. That was the closest Chelsea came to a goal before Poyet's strike, as Dean Richards led the Saints' defence with a stirring performance. But Southampton did not offer much in attack, and it took half an hour before they created a real chance, Kevin Davies playing a neat one-two with Jo Tessem before shooting over the bar from the edge of the penalty area. They were unlucky five minutes into the second half when James Beattie got his head to Jason Dodd's deep cross but watched the ball rebound off the inside of the far post. That came just moments after Dan Petrescu had prevented his former side from increasing their lead, the Romanian midfielder clearing Marcel Desailly's header off the line. But Petrescu was guilty of a glaring miss later when he ran clear of Chelsea's attempted offside trap but, instead of shooting past Carlo Cudicini or taking the ball round him, attempted a lofted shot from 30 yards which went straight to the Italian keeper. Cudicini's compatriot Gianfranco Zola looked to be Chelsea's best hope of another goal, having a penalty appeal turned down when he seemed to be tripped and then having a shot headed away by Richards and a trademark free-kick deflected for a corner. But Southampton always looked dangerous on the break, and as Chelsea began to look more nervous in defence the visitors went for an equaliser, with caretaker manager Stuart Gray sending on Hassan Kachloul, Tahar El Khalej and Uwe Rosler as substitutes. That left Saints exposed in defence, and Jones came to the rescue twice in a minute in the closing stages before his opposite number was again tested. Southampton broke quickly from defence and Cudicini raced out of his area to try to clear from Rosler, but the German striker won the ball before being fouled by Melchiot. Beattie took the free-kick, his shot flying off the defensive wall and just wide of the post. Both sides had chances in a frantic finale, but Chelsea held on to move closer to a European place next season.",

It appears to be sending up the trendy metropolitan media world in which the unmarried thirtysomething Bridget works, the affluent, Home Counties, middle-class circle of her parents and their grotesque friends, and the insecure, man-chasing Bridget herself. But the filmmakers are uncritically in love with their heroine and her milieux and have romanticised them to an almost laughable degree. </p> <p>The office cad, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), Bridget's Mr Wrong, flirts with her by computer and seduces her, drives a Mercedes convertible and lives in a Thamesside apartment of breathtaking luxury. Her Mr Right, the strong, silent Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), is a celebrated civil rights lawyer of impeccable probity whose parents live in a country house that could give Castle Howard a run for its tourist dollar. The film's London is a clean, sparkling place out of a tourist brochure and the idyllic opening and closing Yuletide scenes in the snow are like Dickens at his most celebratory. </p> <p>As appealingly played by Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, the film's Bridget is doubly affected in that we have an American affecting a plausible British accent, but the Sloaney drawl she uses is itself an affectation. She is also inconsistent in her naivety. In the book, she knowingly talks of herself as a 'child of Cosmopolitan culture', yet doesn't know the sporting phrase 'throwing a match'. In the film, despite having a degree in English and working as a publicist for a smart publisher, she thinks F.R. Leavis is still alive and when being interviewed for a TV job professes to believe that El Ni\u00f1o is a Latin American dance. </p> <p>These are the things we laughed at in Monroe and Judy Holliday. They are also what appeal to both the sly suave Daniel, and the decent, kindly Darcy. In Daniel's case, they make her easier to seduce and cast aside; in Darcy's, they're the perfect attributes of the submissive, admiring partner he requires. </p> <p>The co-writers - Helen Fielding, Andrew Davies (in whose TV adaptation of Sense and Sensibility Colin Firth became a star) and Richard Curtis (author of Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill ) - have largely dropped the diary format after the opening few minutes, though the diary itself is used as a plot device in the swooningly romantic climax. </p> <p>We thus see Bridget more objectively than in the book, though whether this makes her narcissism and comic whingeing less tiresome is another matter. In both novel and film, we are clearly intended to find her not merely funny but also sympathetic, moving and exemplary of our age - as Owen might have said (Deborah Owen, the literary agent, that is, not Wilfred Owen), the poetry is in the self-pity. </p> <p>Of the film's three authors, Richard Curtis seems the dominant influence. What one might regard as his Hugh Grant Trilogy (Four Weddings, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones) resembles Howard Hawks's John Wayne Trilogy ( Rio Bravo, El Dorado and Rio Lobo) which, despite having different literary sources, are versions of the same story with similar characters and settings. 'I'm not a damn bit interested in whether somebody thinks this is a copy,' said Hawks, 'because the copy made more money than the original, and I was pleased with it.' </p> <p>So almost everything appears familiar, from the character who obsessively uses the word 'fuck' (as if laughter would flow exponentially from the repetition) through the climactic car chase to the calculatedly embarrassing scenes in which the heroes and heroines make idiots of themselves in public. </p> <p>The most excruciating of the latter comes when Bridget delivers a disastrous speech at a book launch attended by some leading figures in the London literary world, among them Salman Rushdie, who makes the most wincing personal appearance since Graham Hill congratulated Yves Montand on his success on the Monaco circuit in Grand Prix. This sequence should have been one of the film's best, because it could have enabled Sharon Maguire, making her feature debut here, to draw on her experience making documentaries. </p> <p>Another Curtis device, which may well have influenced Fielding's book, is to have the heroine surrounded by a devoted group of colourfully eccentric friends, one of them the gay confidant that's mandatory for every movie heroine nowadays. </p> <p>They're always there to bring her comfort and advice (and to help her with the wine and vodka), though if there were many such people at large in real life there would be queues a mile long at the admission gate of every Trappist monastery in Europe.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Rather like Godot, the spectre of V.S. Naipaul hovers over the Merchant-Ivory production filming in a tropically dense corner of the Booker Prize-winning author's native Trinidad. </p> <p>It is only a fortnight until the end of shooting of The Mystic Masseur, the first film adaptation of a Naipaul novel, and the famously reclusive - or should that be elusive - writer is expected to visit the set shortly before the film 'wraps' on the eve of Carnival. </p> <p>Cast and crew, not to mention the producers, some prominent local financiers and even the Trinidad and Tobago government, are in varying degrees of excitement, anticipation and sheer muck-sweat about the promised return of one of the island's most famous sons. Now 68, Naipaul, son of a hard-working local journalist and writer, left for Oxford University in 1950 and has rarely returned since. </p> <p>According to Letters Between a Father And Son, a volume of revealing correspondence compiled and edited by Naipaul's UK literary agent, Gillon Aitken, as a young exile of 22, Naipaul declared: 'I think I shall die if I had to spend the rest of my life in Trinidad. The place is too small, the values are all wrong and the people are petty.' </p> <p>Now, according to Aitken, Naipaul probably holds pretty much the same view, 'though perhaps not with the same young man's contempt. He does not have much time for the place'. Instead, he has, for the most part, remained in England. </p> <p>Like some literary tennis master, he has amassed a cupboardful of trophies including the Booker Prize (In a Free State), the Hawthornden (Mr Stone and the Knights Companion), Somerset Maugham Award (Miguel Street), W.H. Smith Award (The Mimic Men) and the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial Prize (The Mystic Masseur). Curiously, A House For Mr Biswas, loosely based on the life of his late father and still his most popular work, missed out on the prizes. </p> <p>On location in Trinidad, everyone seems to have his or her own theory about the man - from 'tetchy' and 'temperamental' to 'funny' and even 'playful'. Will he or won't he turn up? The shooting is taking place in Santa Cruz, doubling as the novel's invented Fuente Grove, which is about an hour west of the capital, Port of Spain. A bargain-basement production, even by Merchant-Ivory's own cost-conscious standards, there are no trailers, so cast and extended crew muck in together each day under temporary awnings. A cocoa tree drops its solid fruit like grenades over the set and some stunt cockerels are tethered to the roof to add local colour. </p> <p>It was the comedy that originally attracted Ismail Merchant to The Mystic Masseur, published in 1957 when Naipaul was 25. Set during the Forties and Fifties in and around the island's Indo-Trinidadian community (from which the Naipaul family hails), the story concerns the rise and rise of bookish young Ganesh Ramsumair from failed schoolteacher, aspiring author and struggling masseur (a sort of spiritual healer in local terms) to revered mystic, member of the legislative council and MBE. </p> <p>'When I read it again,' Merchant recalls, 'I was in stitches of laughter, very amused by it and extremely taken with the characters.'

      "bodyText": "Rather like Godot, the spectre of V.S. Naipaul hovers over the Merchant-Ivory production filming in a tropically dense corner of the Booker Prize-winning author's native Trinidad. It is only a fortnight until the end of shooting of The Mystic Masseur, the first film adaptation of a Naipaul novel, and the famously reclusive - or should that be elusive - writer is expected to visit the set shortly before the film 'wraps' on the eve of Carnival. Cast and crew, not to mention the producers, some prominent local financiers and even the Trinidad and Tobago government, are in varying degrees of excitement, anticipation and sheer muck-sweat about the promised return of one of the island's most famous sons. Now 68, Naipaul, son of a hard-working local journalist and writer, left for Oxford University in 1950 and has rarely returned since. According to Letters Between a Father And Son, a volume of revealing correspondence compiled and edited by Naipaul's UK literary agent, Gillon Aitken, as a young exile of 22, Naipaul declared: 'I think I shall die if I had to spend the rest of my life in Trinidad. The place is too small, the values are all wrong and the people are petty.' Now, according to Aitken, Naipaul probably holds pretty much the same view, 'though perhaps not with the same young man's contempt. He does not have much time for the place'. Instead, he has, for the most part, remained in England. Like some literary tennis master, he has amassed a cupboardful of trophies including the Booker Prize (In a Free State), the Hawthornden (Mr Stone and the Knights Companion), Somerset Maugham Award (Miguel Street), W.H. Smith Award (The Mimic Men) and the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial Prize (The Mystic Masseur). Curiously, A House For Mr Biswas, loosely based on the life of his late father and still his most popular work, missed out on the prizes. On location in Trinidad, everyone seems to have his or her own theory about the man - from 'tetchy' and 'temperamental' to 'funny' and even 'playful'. Will he or won't he turn up? The shooting is taking place in Santa Cruz, doubling as the novel's invented Fuente Grove, which is about an hour west of the capital, Port of Spain. A bargain-basement production, even by Merchant-Ivory's own cost-conscious standards, there are no trailers, so cast and extended crew muck in together each day under temporary awnings. A cocoa tree drops its solid fruit like grenades over the set and some stunt cockerels are tethered to the roof to add local colour. It was the comedy that originally attracted Ismail Merchant to The Mystic Masseur, published in 1957 when Naipaul was 25. Set during the Forties and Fifties in and around the island's Indo-Trinidadian community (from which the Naipaul family hails), the story concerns the rise and rise of bookish young Ganesh Ramsumair from failed schoolteacher, aspiring author and struggling masseur (a sort of spiritual healer in local terms) to revered mystic, member of the legislative council and MBE.

So he finally wrote directly to Naipaul, whom he had met some years earlier, told him he'd just finished directing an adaptation of Anita Desai's In Custody and would love to show it to him.

They're a pleasure to look at. The veteran Ernest Haller's images in Michael Curtiz's Mildred Pierce (1945) - the pools of light in fields of darkness, the shadows, silhouettes, reflections, the expressionist distortions - make this one of the great films noirs. Five years earlier, Haller had shared an Oscar for his colour photography on Gone With the Wind , and he later lit Rebel Without a Cause and Anthony Mann's Man of the West , but Mildred Pierce is his finest achievement. Gilbert Taylor shot Richard Lester's A Hard Day's Night (1964) in hand-held cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style, with the grainy high-contrast black-and-white favoured by the smart magazines of the time, and it gives the picture an enormous immediacy and vitality. He'd come straight from shooting Kubrick's Dr Strangelove and went straight on to working with Polanski on the low-budget Repulsion and Cul-de-Sac . He later shot Polanski's Macbeth and Hitchcock's Frenzy before photographing Star Wars . </p> <p>Alun Owen's screenplay for A Hard Day's Night defined the public personas of the Beatles, but his 'day in the life' script has worn badly, as has the central notion of the Beatles as the only authentic beings in Britain. There's scarcely a decent line in the picture, and the role of Wilfrid Brambell as Paul's grandfather is pure embarrassment. Lester's best films (most notably The Knack and Petulia ) were still to come, but the pace and sheer exuberance he brought to the picture (you can glimpse him beaming cheerfully on stage in the finale), the charismatic presence of the Fab Four and the dozen vintage songs have kept it from being a mere time capsule. </p> <p>I never walk along Tottenham Street (just off Tottenham Court Road north of Goodge Street station) and pass Charlotte Mews without releasing a nostalgic sigh. Charlotte Mews is the arched alleyway from which the quartet emerge running, to cross the road and enter the stage door of the now defunct Scala Theatre for the film's climactic concert. Incidentally, the word 'Beatles' is never spoken in the picture, and is only spelt out on Ringo's drums, by a final flashing sign on the rear wall as their set ends, and in a pun when the letters BEA on the helicopter bearing them away to Wolverhampton have had TLES added to it. </p> <p>MGM dumped the 41-year-old Joan Crawford and she went straight to Warner Brothers and won an Oscar with her greatest performance as Mildred Pierce, the Los Angeles career woman who sacrificed everything, nearly including her life, for the daughter (Ann Blyth) she's spoilt rotten. Like many noir melodramas of the time (eg Double Indemnity , Farewell My Lovely ), the movie unfolds in flashback as a doomed narrator explains his or her downfall to the authorities. In this case, the murder suspect Mildred tells the police how she fought her way up from waitress in gingham uniform to rich restaurateur in fur coat. The three men in her life are weak, exploitative and unreliable, the daughter is a monster, and only the great Eve Arden as her wise-cracking chum has any vestige of decency. The hard-boiled dialogue crackles - 'How do you like your drink?' 'Harmless'; 'No wolf whistles?' asks Crawford as she displays her new bathing suit. 'I'd need a police siren,' replies Zachary Scott; 'Leave something on me, I might catch cold,' says Arden to Jack Carson as he mentally undresses her. </p> <p>Rainer Werner Fassbinder called Michael Curtiz 'the anarchist of film noir' but he died before writing the book that was designed to explain this statement. Watching the dark, unnerving Mildred Pierce , which attacks society at every level, subverts morality and family values, and calls into question the American Dream, you can see what Fassbinder was getting at.</p>",

'I'd need a police siren,' replies Zachary Scott; 'Leave something on me, I might catch cold,' says Arden to Jack Carson as he mentally undresses her. Rainer Werner Fassbinder called Michael Curtiz 'the anarchist of film noir' but he died before writing the book that was designed to explain this statement. Watching the dark, unnerving Mildred Pierce , which attacks society at every level, subverts morality and family values, and calls into question the American Dream, you can see what Fassbinder was getting at.",

The present instantaneously turns into the past, and the future - despite promises and prophesies - never arrives. We long for time to have a stop, so that we can start it up again. Why else do we celebrate Easter and the pagan rites of spring from which the festivity of rebirth derived? The millennium allowed us to contemplate a row of zeroes, as if history had suddenly been erased. In politics, revolutions offer the illusory chance of a breach with precedent and custom, and a clear road ahead with the New Jerusalem on the horizon - until the cycle completes itself and counter-revolution restores the old order. </p> <p>In the history of art as well, we are desperate to believe that traditions can suddenly be expunged and reality revised overnight. This mistaken faith lies behind Art That Shook The World , a new BBC2 series about innovation. The title echoes a report on Bolshevism by the American left-winger John Reed, who described the upsets in St Petersburg in 1917 as '10 days that shook the world'; we are asked to imagine the world trembling and tottering all over again as it is affronted by Mozart's Marriage of Figaro, Monet's Sunrise , Joyce's Ulysses, Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin and the biblical Psalms. </p> <p>The excitable presenters do their share of shaking and shuddering, to calibrate the seismic wallop of these novelties. Andrew Graham-Dixon, jumping up and down before Monet's impression of bleary dawn in Le Havre harbour, says that this painting 'truly did change the world', though he omits to say how, since by his own account Le Havre is as much of a dump now as it was in Monet's day. Nevertheless, Graham-Dixon gives the metaphor an additional charge of violence by contending that the picture set off 'an avant-garde earthquake'. T5om Paulin, explicating Ulysses, gives a more lurid variant of the clich\u00e9: the novel, he says, 'shocked and shook the world'. All this seems to mean is that it made Paulin's twitchy teenage member quiver when he first read it, since for him its primary claim to revolutionary status is that it contains farts, knickers and is 'wonderfully obscene'. Renny Bartlett, vaulting down the Odessa steps in the programme about Potemkin, shouts that Eisenstein 'literally changed history'. No he didn't, he merely fictionalised it: the massacre on that stairway never happened. </p> <p>Sensational exaggeration replaces sober critical assessment. Barbara Bonney - an opera singer who, interestingly, is the least hyper and histrionic of the presenters - feels obliged to call Figaro 'the greatest opera ever written' and Paulin inevitably acclaims Ulysses as 'the greatest novel ever written'. These are flagrantly and uselessly personal enthusiasms. The Belfast earth may have moved when Paulin first panted his way through Molly Bloom's randy monologue at 17, but did our steady, reliable old globe pause in its rotation? Sunrise, Monet's subject, is something that happens every day. It's a habit the sun has, and its recurrence does not necessarily betoken a messianic New Dawn, like the one which Madame Blavatsky and the Theosophists prated about at the start of the twentieth century. </p> <p>The shaking in question was a local occurrence and soon subsided, like a tremor which hardly agitates the instruments monitoring the San Andreas fault. The first production of Figaro was seen a mere nine times in Vienna in 1781. Even in Bolshevik Moscow, Potemkin played only in a few half-empty cinemas, overtaken in popularity by Douglas Fairbanks's Robin Hood; in Britain, where the censors were nervous after the General Strike of 1926, it was withheld from public exhibition until 1954. The men of power, ultimately, had nothing to fear from the artists who challenged them. Emperor Joseph II's decision to license Figaro for performance was, as Bonney acknowledges, a gesture of patronising, permissive tolerance. Ten years later Mozart, the victim of Joseph's legislation about burial practices and urban hygiene, was dumped in a pauper's grave. Eisenstein worked and indeed lived only so long as Stalin permitted him to. If he hadn't danced himself to death on the set of Ivan the Terrible, the dictator would no doubt have dispatched him to the gulag. </p> <p>Popularity, when it eventually came, lessened the force of these supposedly radical works, sedating them by repetition, defusing them through parody and pastiche. Monet, as Graham-Dixon says, was 'mugged by his own celebrity': he illustrates the point by brandishing a coffee mug with Sunrise imprinted on it. Arias from Figaro are sold as 'easy listening', and recommended for their soothing influence on unborn babies. The editorial cuts and clashes of the Odessa steps sequence from Potemkin are mimicked in a television commercial for ketchup: a dowager orders her limo to bump down the steps so she can jerk the sauce out of her bottle. Innovation is soon enough absorbed into a commercial system which appreciates novelty because it is fashionable and therefore potentially profitable. </p> <p>Would the movers and shakers in question have minded if they'd known how little the world actually changed? I doubt it. Only hucksters bother about creating scandals and sensations, and only egomaniacs think that their own originality makes all pre-existing works of art redundant. Ulysses is, among other things, an anthology of previous literature, from Homeric epic to late-romantic lyricism; T.S. Eliot approved of it because he saw that it wanted to grow back into the classical past rather than ejecting itself into an experimental future. For the same reason Monet, not content with anecdotes about the industrial city like Sunrise, went on to paint Rouen cathedral, training his own molten, deliquescent light on the ancestral heritage of European imagery. He may have changed the way we see the world, deflecting it through a luminous haze, but objects are not altered by our subjective whimsies. Graham-Dixon calls him one of the first 'architects of modern perception'. Again it's a wistful metaphor: perceptions are too fickle and unverifiable to be called architectonic. </p> <p>Some dissident good sense about the ambitions of artists is talked by Jonathan Miller in the programme on Figaro. The opera moves him, he says, because it's so elegiac and backward-looking. It meticulously recreates a busy social world that has been defunct for more than 200 years; to stage it is an act of resurrection, evoking 'the fragility and mortality of being us'. The Beaumarchais play which Mozart adapted may have been 'the revolution in action', as Napoleon said, but the opera is not concerned with class war, vengeance and restitution. It is about lost happiness and a forfeited harmony, briefly recovered when, at the very end, all the disputatious characters finally sing together for the first time. </p> <p>Does this mean that art is impotent? Auden thought so, and believed this was its safeguard. He posthumously rebuked Yeats - who thought of his verses as a goad to ideological combat - by declaring 'Poetry makes nothing happen'. Whenever poetry or any other art does make things happen, what happens is generally deplorable. Goebbels admired Potemkin and commissioned Leni Riefenstahl to copy it. In her Triumph of the Will , the Cossack troops goose-stepping down\\the steps become the heroes, since Eisenstein's choreographic style can be applied to whatever political content you choose. Hitler's regime was uniquely and disturbingly dependent on such imagery: fascism, as Walter Benjamin argued, is politics aestheticised. The same can be said today about consumer capitalism, which - as the Monet mug and the Eisenstein sauce bottle prove - exploits art to boost sales. We are all the dupes of an aestheticised economy. Art, rather than shaking the world, helps it keep commodities circulating. </p> <p>Throughout western history, consciousness and even conduct have been modified by poems, plays, pieces of music. But those changes have occurred slowly and stealthily, rather than with the explosive \u00e9clat dramatised by the BBC's presenters. We fall in love, expressing gratuitous emotions according to a ritualised series of rules, because Proven\u00e7al troubadours in the twelfth century invented a newly reverent way of sublimating sexual feeling. Romanticism demonstrates how assiduously life imitated art. When Goethe's hero Werther shot himself, dozens of actual wannabes did the same, expressing their contempt for a drably unsatisfactory reality. The example of Hamlet was equally baleful: the Russian film director Grigori Kozintsev believed that the nineteenth century suffered from a malady he called 'Hamletism' - a surfeit of moody thought, which undermined the capacity for political action. </p> <p>The motor of history, on those intermittent occasions when it does start up, is intellectual not artistic. Jean Cocteau called art 'science given flesh', and the scientific conjectures of the early twentieth century irrevocably altered the physical substance of the world and our feelings about it. Nuclear physics devised a formula for destroying the earth; if the ground seems tremulous underfoot, blame Einstein not Joyce. Artists did go on to describe the psychological consequences of this instability: the hero of Patricia Highsmith's Strangers on a Train commiserates with the split atom, and reflects on a moral quandary by pondering the electron theory, which has broken 'the universal law of oneness'. </p> <p>The one programme in the series that makes the thesis work is Germaine Greer's investigation of the Psalms. She treats them as poetry (and gives some notably actressy readings of them, in one case striding up the aisle of an empty cathedral and shaking her fist at a crucifix while she demands why father has deserted her). But of course they are much more than verse. Because they purport to be the words of God, anyone who quotes them - whether unctuously mumbling them like the Anglican clerics she interviews, jazzily rapping through them like Rastafarians, or pentecostally babbling them in unknown tongues - purports to be a divine or perhaps demonic ventriloquist. The Psalms, Greer points out, empower people and also make them crazy: the argument is more impressive than the spectacle of Paulin stomping through a maze which represents the complexities of Ulysses and bellowing 'It's driving me mad!' Heretics were set alight during the Reformation because they ventured to make slight changes in approved translations of the Psalms. David, the singer of these songs, lends his star to the Zionist flag, and his name to the cultist David Koresh, incinerated at Waco in Texas with his loyal Davidian acolytes. </p> <p>Here is a genuine case - even more frightening than the revelation of art's complicity with totalitarianism in the Potemkin programme - of art provoking change, and doing so for the worst. Otherwise we should be grateful that the earth revolves without being revolutionary, and is beyond being redeemed (or annihilated) by art. I apologise for breaking the news on Easter Sunday, when the world is indeed being shaken by something more precious than art: the pressure of growth, tunnelling through the soil and making the ground crack open. </p> <p>Art That Shook the World is on Saturdays on BBC2. Figaro is shown on 21 April; Potemkin on 28 April and Psalms on 5 May. </p> <p><strong>Did any work of artchange the world? Some people think so</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Richard Eyre</strong> </p> <p>In <strong> The Cherry Orchard </strong> (1904), Chekhov showed how to write about private lives and public ideas in the contemporary world in an unprecedented way: realistic, humane, spare, poetic, unsentimental and prescient. </p> <p><strong> Philip French</strong> </p> <p>As important as the coming of sound, Orson Welles's <strong> Citizen Kane</strong> (1941) opened up new directions for the movies and created more cinematic vocations than any other film. It announced the possibility of a serious, ironic, playful cinema, at once personal and public, popular and avant-garde. It challenged the rules and orthodoxies. It showed that anyone (who happened to be a genius experienced in theatre and radio) could occupy a Hollywood sound stage and, with the help of veteran technicians, direct a masterpiece. It shook the world. Satyajit Ray, India's greatest filmmaker, said the major regret of his life was his absence from Calcutta during its brief 1941 run. Jorge Luis Borges, Latin America's greatest writer, wrote the only persuasively unfavourable review, and went blind before he could revise it. There is Cinema BK and Cinema AK. It's that much of a landmark. </p> <p><strong> Ronan Bennett</strong> </p> <p>The <strong> King James Version of the Bible</strong> (1611). Who'd have thought that a book put together by a committee of dusty old academics and theologians working under state supervision would produce one of the most sublime works in the English language, and at the same time inspire ordinary Englishmen and women first to resist and eventually to behead the son of the very man who authorised its creation? With its dramatic and hypnotic cadences and its unsettling imagery, it contains writing of the greatest invention and beauty. </p> <p><strong> Jonathan Kent</strong> </p> <p>For the first time in our civilisation, Euripides in <strong> Medea</strong> created a protagonist confronting a force and a passion which was no longer an alien being from without - 'a god' - but inescapably part of her own psychology. Medea's struggle is an internal one, and what had been the gods now become psychological archetypes. In this sense it is the first modern play. </p> <p><strong> Jude Kelly</strong> </p> <p>Athol Fugard's <strong> Sizwe Bansi Is Dead</strong> was produced by the Market Theatre Company in South Africa during apartheid. It toured Europe and America and any other part of the world it could get to. It was one of the most vital, artistic and political experiences. It was art illuminating what apartheid meant emotionally. It had an enormous effect on how people shifted that political situation. </p> <p><strong> Paul Morley</strong> </p> <p>Marcel Duchamp's <strong> The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even</strong> because it was a work that changed art.</p>",

The editorial cuts and clashes of the Odessa steps sequence from Potemkin are mimicked in a television commercial for ketchup: a dowager orders her limo to bump down the steps so she can jerk the sauce out of her bottle. Innovation is soon enough absorbed into a commercial system which appreciates novelty because it is fashionable and therefore potentially profitable. Would the movers and shakers in question have minded if they'd known how little the world actually changed? I doubt it. Only hucksters bother about creating scandals and sensations, and only egomaniacs think that their own originality makes all pre-existing works of art redundant. Ulysses is, among other things, an anthology of previous literature, from Homeric epic to late-romantic lyricism; T.S. Eliot approved of it because he saw that it wanted to grow back into the classical past rather than ejecting itself into an experimental future. For the same reason Monet, not content with anecdotes about the industrial city like Sunrise, went on to paint Rouen cathedral, training his own molten, deliquescent light on the ancestral heritage of European imagery. He may have changed the way we see the world, deflecting it through a luminous haze, but objects are not altered by our subjective whimsies. Graham-Dixon calls him one of the first 'architects of modern perception'. Again it's a wistful metaphor: perceptions are too fickle and unverifiable to be called architectonic. Some dissident good sense about the ambitions of artists is talked by Jonathan Miller in the programme on Figaro. The opera moves him, he says, because it's so elegiac and backward-looking. It meticulously recreates a busy social world that has been defunct for more than 200 years; to stage it is an act of resurrection, evoking 'the fragility and mortality of being us'. The Beaumarchais play which Mozart adapted may have been 'the revolution in action', as Napoleon said, but the opera is not concerned with class war, vengeance and restitution. It is about lost happiness and a forfeited harmony, briefly recovered when, at the very end, all the disputatious characters finally sing together for the first time. Does this mean that art is impotent? Auden thought so, and believed this was its safeguard. He posthumously rebuked Yeats - who thought of his verses as a goad to ideological combat - by declaring 'Poetry makes nothing happen'. Whenever poetry or any other art does make things happen, what happens is generally deplorable. Goebbels admired Potemkin and commissioned Leni Riefenstahl to copy it. In her Triumph of the Will , the Cossack troops goose-stepping down\\the steps become the heroes, since Eisenstein's choreographic style can be applied to whatever political content you choose. Hitler's regime was uniquely and disturbingly dependent on such imagery: fascism, as Walter Benjamin argued, is politics aestheticised. The same can be said today about consumer capitalism, which - as the Monet mug and the Eisenstein sauce bottle prove - exploits art to boost sales. We are all the dupes of an aestheticised economy. Art, rather than shaking the world, helps it keep commodities circulating. Throughout western history, consciousness and even conduct have been modified by poems, plays, pieces of music. But those changes have occurred slowly and stealthily, rather than with the explosive \u00e9clat dramatised by the BBC's presenters. We fall in love, expressing gratuitous emotions according to a ritualised series of rules, because Proven\u00e7al troubadours in the twelfth century invented a newly reverent way of sublimating sexual feeling. Romanticism demonstrates how assiduously life imitated art. When Goethe's hero Werther shot himself, dozens of actual wannabes did the same, expressing their contempt for a drably unsatisfactory reality. The example of Hamlet was equally baleful: the Russian film director Grigori Kozintsev believed that the nineteenth century suffered from a malady he called 'Hamletism' - a surfeit of moody thought, which undermined the capacity for political action. The motor of history, on those intermittent occasions when it does start up, is intellectual not artistic. Jean Cocteau called art 'science given flesh', and the scientific conjectures of the early twentieth century irrevocably altered the physical substance of the world and our feelings about it. Nuclear physics devised a formula for destroying the earth; if the ground seems tremulous underfoot, blame Einstein not Joyce. Artists did go on to describe the psychological consequences of this instability: the hero of Patricia Highsmith's Strangers on a Train commiserates with the split atom, and reflects on a moral quandary by pondering the electron theory, which has broken 'the universal law of oneness'. The one programme in the series that makes the thesis work is Germaine Greer's investigation of the Psalms. She treats them as poetry (and gives some notably actressy readings of them, in one case striding up the aisle of an empty cathedral and shaking her fist at a crucifix while she demands why father has deserted her). But of course they are much more than verse. Because they purport to be the words of God, anyone who quotes them - whether unctuously mumbling them like the Anglican clerics she interviews, jazzily rapping through them like Rastafarians, or pentecostally babbling them in unknown tongues - purports to be a divine or perhaps demonic ventriloquist. The Psalms, Greer points out, empower people and also make them crazy: the argument is more impressive than the spectacle of Paulin stomping through a maze which represents the complexities of Ulysses and bellowing 'It's driving me mad!' Heretics were set alight during the Reformation because they ventured to make slight changes in approved translations of the Psalms. David, the singer of these songs, lends his star to the Zionist flag, and his name to the cultist David Koresh, incinerated at Waco in Texas with his loyal Davidian acolytes. Here is a genuine case - even more frightening than the revelation of art's complicity with totalitarianism in the Potemkin programme - of art provoking change, and doing so for the worst. Otherwise we should be grateful that the earth revolves without being revolutionary, and is beyond being redeemed (or annihilated) by art. I apologise for breaking the news on Easter Sunday, when the world is indeed being shaken by something more precious than art: the pressure of growth, tunnelling through the soil and making the ground crack open. Art That Shook the World is on Saturdays on BBC2. Figaro is shown on 21 April; Potemkin on 28 April and Psalms on 5 May. Did any work of artchange the world? Some people think so Richard Eyre In The Cherry Orchard (1904), Chekhov showed how to write about private lives and public ideas in the contemporary world in an unprecedented way: realistic, humane, spare, poetic, unsentimental and prescient. Philip French As important as the coming of sound, Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941) opened up new directions for the movies and created more cinematic vocations than any other film. It announced the possibility of a serious, ironic, playful cinema, at once personal and public, popular and avant-garde. It challenged the rules and orthodoxies. It showed that anyone (who happened to be a genius experienced in theatre and radio) could occupy a Hollywood sound stage and, with the help of veteran technicians, direct a masterpiece. It shook the world. Satyajit Ray, India's greatest filmmaker, said the major regret of his life was his absence from Calcutta during its brief 1941 run. Jorge Luis Borges, Latin America's greatest writer, wrote the only persuasively unfavourable review, and went blind before he could revise it. There is Cinema BK and Cinema AK. It's that much of a landmark. Ronan Bennett The King James Version of the Bible (1611). Who'd have thought that a book put together by a committee of dusty old academics and theologians working under state supervision would produce one of the most sublime works in the English language, and at the same time inspire ordinary Englishmen and women first to resist and eventually to behead the son of the very man who authorised its creation? With its dramatic and hypnotic cadences and its unsettling imagery, it contains writing of the greatest invention and beauty. Jonathan Kent For the first time in our civilisation, Euripides in Medea created a protagonist confronting a force and a passion which was no longer an alien being from without - 'a god' - but inescapably part of her own psychology. Medea's struggle is an internal one, and what had been the gods now become psychological archetypes. In this sense it is the first modern play. Jude Kelly Athol Fugard's Sizwe Bansi Is Dead was produced by the Market Theatre Company in South Africa during apartheid. It toured Europe and America and any other part of the world it could get to. It was one of the most vital, artistic and political experiences. It was art illuminating what apartheid meant emotionally. It had an enormous effect on how people shifted that political situation. Paul Morley Marcel Duchamp's The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even because it was a work that changed art.",

      "body": "<p>Roddy Doyle, the Irish novelist loved by millions, lies back in an easy chair with his legs outstretched and his arms comfortably behind his head, and says that nowadays 'happiness is a pretty usual state of mind'. But he's also said said that unhappiness is harder to avoid as you get older. </p> <p>Certainly, his own novels have darkened over the years, shifting from exuberant optimism to something bleaker and sadder and not so convinced of people's innate goodness. In his earlier fiction, like his self-published The Commitments or The Van, the tone is one of lovely, poignant optimism and comic survivalism. But this gives way to the bleaker world of Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha - where a boy watches his parents' marriage disintegrating - or the shocking, touching narrative of an abused wife, The Woman Who Walked Into Doors. </p> <p>The Doyle landscape darkened further with the publication, two years ago, of A Star Called Henry. A first novel in a planned trilogy about Ireland's bloody twentieth century, it was a movement away from contemporary domestic sadness, loneliness, friendship and joy into the savage epic, the recent history where fact is stranger than fiction and where it's not so easy to forgive, to be optimistic, to make jokes (though he tries). </p> <p>Doyle seemed to have left behind Barrytown and the Rabittes, demotic fluency and psychological finesse, for a more savage land. It is as if he has created a dark looking-glass reflection of his own successful and self-avowedly contented life. Where he is happy, his characters suffer. </p> <p>They fail where he succeeds. They remind him of worlds he is lucky enough not to inhabit. Well, you could have said all that - drawn a neat, downwards-plunging graph of Doyle's progress, summed up his 'phases' - but not if you'd just seen his latest venture, the quirky, slightly surreal romantic comedy, When Brendan Met Trudy. This is Doyle's first original film script (he has of course adapted the Barrytown Trilogy, The Commitments, The Snapper and The Van, before), and it is light-footed, warm-hearted, full of a sense of its own fun - and full, too, of homages and film-buff nods to other films, from the title (When Harry Met Sally), through the opening sequence (a man lies face downwards on a street, in the rain, a reference to Sunset Boulevard), and on for the rest of the film, actual fragments of classic movies intercut with the action. </p> <p>When I meet Doyle and his director, Kieron Walsh, they try and list them all for me. They sit back in their chairs, both dressed in black, legs outstretched, grinning at each other. </p> <p>'The Quiet Man,' says Doyle. </p> <p>'Once Upon a Time in the West,' adds Walsh. </p> <p>'The African Queen.' </p> <p>'The Producers.' </p> <p>Even a snatch of a film which they made up because they couldn't get permission to use La Strada. </p> <p>Urgently chasing their schedule and with an eye on their limited budget, they found a skinny Italian man who looked as if he'd been chiselled out of granite in 1947, and a big, good-looking woman, and gave him a bike and her a basket of food and put them in front of a pile of old bricks. </p> <p>'Hair-raising,' says Walsh fondly. </p> <p>'Actually the whole thing was the most even-tempered and level-headed experience,' says Doyle. 'Kieron's pretty even-tempered.' </p> <p>'Yes, I had a temper every day.' </p> <p>'Although directors are supposed to wear jodhpurs and carry whips and stomp around, aren't they? Just as well we didn't do that. It was fun,' says Doyle. 'And writing is such a lonely business.' </p> <p>When Brendan met Trudy began with a single, cinematic image - and it was always going to be a film, never a written story; 'it was to be seen and heard'. Roddy Doyle was listening to an old John McCormack song, 'Three O'Clock in the Morning', which had been recorded in 1917 and had a crackle over it that reminded Doyle of the sound of rain falling ('To another man', interposes Walsh, 'it might remind them of an egg frying, mind'). And he found himself imagining a man lying face down in the street, at three in the morning. </p> <p>'It was a stark image, so I turned it on its face, to reflect my own state of mind at the time. I was happy. It's not an unusual state of mind for me.' The subsequent story is also a melancholy one turned inside out. Brendan is an unenthusiastic teacher, unmarried and dysfunctional and lonely; he sings baritone in a church choir and watches old movies in his drab flat; he hides behind heroic characters like John Wayne, and lives life through them. Trudy is blonde and wacky and earns her money by stealing. She barges her way into Brendan's life and capsizes him utterly. They don't rightly belong together, but the film railroads them into romance anyway, insisting on the possibility of happiness and a happy ending against the odds. </p> <p>'Well', protests Doyle, 'you're always seeing people together who don't seem to fit. Stunning women with men from the Smurfs. It's like that song: \"Is she really going out with him?\" </p> <p>'You see women dropping off Charles Haughey and he's an ugly little dwarf. Nobody suggests that Annie Hall wouldn't fall for Woody Allen. And look at Dawn French - she's not conventionally attractive, but she's so funny that she's just great. Then there are gorgeous people and you meet them and, well, there's not a lot going on there, and the attraction just slips away. You've just got to be happy to be yourself. Anyway, Brendan sings like a bird and he's prepared to make a fool of himself for Trudy. That's important.' </p> <p>'She's charmed by him,' adds Walsh, and for some reason the two men find this rather funny and giggle nicely at each other once more, like little boys. One of the last scenes of the film is shot in Dublin's Mountjoy prison, a prison for men that is so overcrowded, says Walsh, that its inmates (solidly working-class) can only have showers once every two weeks. </p> <p>'They're just wandering round the corridors like zombies. Eighty per cent of them are heroin addicts; if they're not before they come in, they are by the time they get out again. </p> <p>Doyle nods. 'I used to teach some of them,' he says. 'And some of the prison officers. I was in the prison, and I'd be saying hello to the POs and look over my shoulder and see an inmate I knew too. I came away with my feathers a bit ruffled.' </p> <p>Doyle was a teacher until eight years ago. He stopped when Paddy Clarke was short-listed for the Booker Prize in 1993 - when it won, Doyle was only in his early thirties, suddenly rich, famous, one of Ireland's sons. His fear in giving up was that he would be severed from the world that he wrote about - his characters aren't usually successful, they are working- or lower-middle class; they struggle and often survive and sometimes fail. </p> <p> 'I was determined not to cut myself off from all of that. I had to make sure I kept an eye on the real world. It came up to my desks when I was a teacher. If you are a writer you're at home, which means you're out of touch. You have to make excuses to get out there and look at how the world is changing. For instance, in Brendan Met Trudy I had to make a big effort to get Dublin the way it is now. It's changed so much in the last decade, and I wanted to get that - the Nigerian character who gets deported, that wouldn't have happened before. But I love learning; it is engrossing and part of the job. With the second in the Irish history trilogy, I have to find out about America before the war - a vanished world, and I must try to get closer and closer to it: jazz, skyscrapers being built. As my character moves through it all, I have to move with him. </p> <p>'It's true that it is harder now than 10 years ago for me to know how a teenager would talk, say. I don't come into regular contact with 14- to 16-year-olds any more - and my children aren't old enough yet. I try and listen to people. I heard these two young women the other day, and one of them was telling the other about dumping this one poor guy and going out with someone else. \"He was a bit full-on,\" she said. I really liked that somehow. Full-on.' </p> <p>Walsh responds with a story about a screening to an audience of young people of the newly filmed Beckett plays (one of which, Rough for Theatre One, he directed). At the end, the teenagers were asked what they thought. 'They yawned widely and they said the plays were shite.' He and Doyle laugh, hugely pleased. </p> <p>'Or heroin addicts,' says Doyle. 'I've met heroin addicts and I'm trying to understand the language around heroin - not that I'm intending to write about it, but I want to understand. I sometimes arrange sessions with kids, say; go into schools or something - they love it; people are really keen to talk about things, you know. And I jump at the chance to go into prisons. If I was in jail and I heard that Maeve Binchy was coming in, that'd keep me going. I think they look forward to my visits; I know I do.' </p> <p>Doyle has steered clear of fame's trappings. He doesn't look like a star or a rich man; he remains modest and funny and unpretentious. 'I'm a well-known face in Dublin, of course. But when The Commitments was released 10 years ago, I made sure I used the same pubs, the same trains, went to the same places. I never allowed myself to become a celebrity or to let that state of mind interfere with my life. And at school I had been teaching 12 years before that film - I was just part of the furniture. They just knew me as their teacher.' Punk Doyle, he was called, because of his earring - though apparently, for all his laid-back manner, he was quite a disciplinarian. </p> <p>'When Snapper was released,' he goes on, 'there was a special screening, and the kids had a half day off and we bussed them all there for it. It was brilliant.' He turns to Kieron Walsh: 'You know, the day afterwards, three lads came up to me and said, \"That film was great.\" They hovered for a while and then added, \"Will you write a song for our band?\" I said, \"But lads, I didn't write 'Mustang Sally', you know.\" Touching, though. They thought I could write music too. Sweet.' </p> <p>Doyle has three children of his own now, of 10 and under. He takes them to their school (a non-denominational state school) in the morning and spends time with them when they return at the end of their day. Because of them, he has started writing children's books. 'I've always told them stories at night, but I'm not very good at making stories up on the spur of the moment. Kids are easily satisfied, but I was never happy with the tales I told them out of my head, so at the end of each working day I'd write a couple of pages for them and read it to them after school and get their reactions. They had some great ideas for how it should go - well, some of them were off the wall as well. And it also gave them a solid sense of what it is that I do every day.' </p> <p>Roddy Doyle knows he is lucky - it's perhaps that knowledge that keeps him normal, focused on the lives of ordinary people, surrounded by close friendships. 'I have worked very hard for it, but I'm very lucky, yes. It could not have happened. I don't work to any commissions. I do what I want to do. My novels come from within me; they are things I feel I want to do.' His success has given him the time and the freedom to do answer to no one but himself. He says that it would be boring to keep on doing just more of the same (as some of his readers want him to, preferring the Barrytown Doyle to the Easter Rising one). But what characterises all of Doyle's work, light and dark, is a certain sweetness of tone; an unsentimental lovability. He has faith in his characters. He listens to their voices and with a beautiful lack of ego he disappears, letting them be heard instead. </p> <p> When Brendan Met Trudy opens in May</p>",

'When Snapper was released,' he goes on, 'there was a special screening, and the kids had a half day off and we bussed them all there for it. It was brilliant.' He turns to Kieron Walsh: 'You know, the day afterwards, three lads came up to me and said, \"That film was great.\" They hovered for a while and then added, \"Will you write a song for our band?\" I said, \"But lads, I didn't write 'Mustang Sally', you know.\" Touching, though. They thought I could write music too. Sweet.' Doyle has three children of his own now, of 10 and under. He takes them to their school (a non-denominational state school) in the morning and spends time with them when they return at the end of their day. Because of them, he has started writing children's books. 'I've always told them stories at night, but I'm not very good at making stories up on the spur of the moment. Kids are easily satisfied, but I was never happy with the tales I told them out of my head, so at the end of each working day I'd write a couple of pages for them and read it to them after school and get their reactions. They had some great ideas for how it should go - well, some of them were off the wall as well. And it also gave them a solid sense of what it is that I do every day.' Roddy Doyle knows he is lucky - it's perhaps that knowledge that keeps him normal, focused on the lives of ordinary people, surrounded by close friendships. 'I have worked very hard for it, but I'm very lucky, yes. It could not have happened. I don't work to any commissions. I do what I want to do. My novels come from within me; they are things I feel I want to do.' His success has given him the time and the freedom to do answer to no one but himself. He says that it would be boring to keep on doing just more of the same (as some of his readers want him to, preferring the Barrytown Doyle to the Easter Rising one). But what characterises all of Doyle's work, light and dark, is a certain sweetness of tone; an unsentimental lovability. He has faith in his characters. He listens to their voices and with a beautiful lack of ego he disappears, letting them be heard instead. When Brendan Met Trudy opens in May",

There, in the library of my old school, underneath the very large and familiar Victorian oil portrait of the first headmistress, Miss Jones, the young audience sat rapt - and so did we. </p> <p>Funnily enough, only the week before, I had revisited the dear old school for the first time in 20 years. The headmistress told me that these days there were lots of absorbing extracurricular lectures, from politicians, environmentalists and, indeed, women with HIV, only one of a slew of radical changes that made me feel like Methuselah's great-aunt. </p> <p>In my 1970s human biology lessons, however, we were still largely taught by clever, well-meaning (though rarely inspiring) variations on the theme of Miss Jones, so while the Sex Pistols topped the charts we were warned about the possible dangers of sitting alone on a sofa with a young and uncontrollably virile member of the opposite sex. </p> <p>It was made clear that we were all potential passive victims of a kind of male biological madness - one kiss and we'd be unhinged with desire; one grope and our O-levels would be in jeopardy; one screw and it would be bye-bye further education, hello Fallen Womanhood. Sex, then, in all its complex glory was apparently catching. Back then, of course, we couldn't know how catching. </p> <p>At 22, having just graduated from university, Emma met a man - 'a bit of all right, really!' - and after six weeks of dating and insisting on safe sex, caught herself a potential death sentence when the condom broke. 'I was gobsmacked. I couldn't believe this person I had fallen head over heels in love with had it... in the first two years, I went to maybe a dozen funerals which, in your early twenties, you don't expect to be doing.' </p> <p>Emma is an extraordinary young woman, smart, funny, pithy, seemingly unconsumed by anger ('Time. Great healer. Move on!' she said, with irony. 'Well he didn't go out of his way to infect me...'). She doesn't appear to have much contact with her family now because they didn't take the news very well. Instead, she paints, plays golf, uses a flat-packed 'sort of Ikea' coffin as a windowseat (it houses her record collection), is upfront about her condition when she meets men ('and see if I get a first drink out of them', though unsurprisingly they tend to bolt) and she waits. </p> <p>There's an awful lot of waiting. Allergic to the drugs that might arrest the HIV, she doesn't expect to make 40, much less 50. The man who gave her the virus is now dead. </p> <p>Sarah discovered she had contracted HIV at 17, when she was pregnant. She terminated the pregnancy and more or less took to her bed for a few years. Now 25 and on a cocktail of drugs that appear to be working (the virus is currently 'undetectable'), Sarah enjoys the support of her mother and a lovely nurse: 'They're all special to us,' said Jenny of her HIV-positive patients, 'but Sarah could have been my daughter.' </p> <p>Jenny talked, too, of the way the disease is seen: 'People have cancer and you feel sorry for them, but HIV? You walk away. It's the British attitude to sex, I think.' Quite true, but then what hope is there for a nation whose teachers inculcate in their pupils a lifelong fear of sofas ? </p> <p>Sarah was filmed in the West End celebrating her twenty-fifth birthday with a giggle of girlfriends and looking very much as though hers would be the most positive outcome for a Positive Woman. Blithely, she remarked: 'A few boyfriends have taken a few days off work after I've told them [about the virus]. I don't know if it's a coincidence...' Probably not. </p> <p>Nicki is my age, 37, so she probably had the same kind of biology lessons. Either way, as a travel rep, Nicki had a hedonistic time cut short only when she discovered she had the virus, at 25. Five years later, she met Karl ('I just wasn't fazed in any way at all') and they practised safe sex until their condom broke, too (this programme wasn't great PR for the barrier method). Though Karl didn't catch the virus, Nicki discovered she was pregnant. 'It was better to think positive,' she recalled without irony. She had a daughter, Ellen, who was diagnosed HIV-positive at 15 months. </p> <p>In a heartbreaking scene, Nicki recalled her daughter's death. After an 'amazing vision', in which a 'beautiful' Ellen was being led away from her, she decided that her sick daughter 'might need to hear from us that's it's OK to go. And as I said those words she took her last breath and it felt so right... she'd opened my heart to a love that I'd never known existed until I'd had a child.' Karl and Nicki have now split and Nicki is 'not in a relationship and I don't intend to be', but she treats herself to a lot of massages because 'it's important to be touched'. </p> <p>I have given all three of the Positive Women so much space because they deserve it. These days, when the format often looks tired and debased, this was a perfect documentary that simply and seriously tackled a highly emotive subject without squeezing from it a drop of sentimentality. </p> <p>In a week that also saw ITV's <strong>Pride of Britain Awards</strong>, a syrupy gong show for an arbitrary selection of the extraordinarily ordinary, in which the likes of Ulrika Jonsson 'honoured' the architects of the London Eye alongside a woman who ran a hospice for children, a little girl with cancer and another woman who saves swans, Positive Women highlighted how desperately important it is to be touched by dignified and moving factual television, rather than bludgeoned into crocodile tears in the name of ratings. </p> <p>But just to reassure readers that I'm still in touch with my shallow side, the second best documentary of the week was about surfing. Like all the finest sports, surfing is beautiful, terrifying and pointless in equal measure, so while C4's <strong>Ride the Wild Surf</strong> might have been shallow it was shallow in a really deep kinda way. Or at least as deep as rudely healthy American men called Laird Hamilton, Darrick Doerner, Brett Lickle and Rush Randle (yes, really. Only Boogie Nights' Dirk Diggler was missing from the surf-porn all-stars line-up), with their bull-necks, David Coulthard jawlines and the kind of blank expressions that hint either at a great spiritual peace or an enormous stupidity, can be when talking really heavy shit about big waves. </p> <p>'Fear gives you intelligence' (though not obviously manifest here) or, after a fun day out avoiding death on a small tsunami : 'That was pretty gnarly!', and my favourite, when faced with an imminent wipe-out: 'It's balls to the wall!

The titans of the tides, kings of the crests - the so-called 'Watermen' - are mad, but my god it makes for great pictures. </p> <p>They ride only the biggest and most fearsome waves in the world, like Maui's Jaws, a wall of water that has been known to roll in at 70ft, though usually hovers at around a manageable - for the merely mildly certifiable - 30ft. Given that the watermen face death regularly, their claim that the experience offers quite a lot in the way of 'spiritual growth' probably isn't to be laughed at, though it's fabulous for one's muscle tone, too. </p> <p>All the men interviewed (thirty- and fortysomethings, mostly - this is a sport you grow into, not out of) are sponsored professional surfers, so when they're not tracking waves and weather formations on the web, they're inventing real neat new surf stuff, like the snowboard-style surfboard (an 'airboard') with a hydrofoil that literally allows the surfer to fly above the water! The airboard experience looked so mind-blowingly thrilling that had I known such a thing might one day exist, the teenage me would have got straight off that sofa and delayed losing her virginity indefinitely.

      "body": "<b> Melbourne Comedy Festival</b> <p> Australians are so much better than everyone else at everything you can think of that it hardly comes as a surprise to discover that the Melbourne Comedy Festival, the third largest in the world, is also the most fun. Perfect weather, beautiful venues, cheap beer, and a choice selection of the best international and domestic live comedy: you can see why most comedians rate it more highly than Edinburgh and Montreal. </p> <p>I was fully expecting the event to follow the pattern of the Sydney Olympics - bronzed and muscular Australian comics whupping their foreign counterparts with superior wit, delivery and observational perspicuity - until I discovered that there is, after all, a downside to the general marvellousness of life down under. Having watched 16 Aussie comics performing five-minute slots at the opening-night gala, I felt like I understood the essence of the nation's humour: the Poms are negative and uptight, the Yanks are ignorant and bizarre... we are positive, relaxed, clued-up and down-to-earth, so let's laugh at them. The result is a kind of patriotic smugness, which does not make for great humour. </p> <p>When I mentioned this theory to some Aussies, they became annoyed and defensive. More to the point, they didn't believe me. Our comics are the best, they yelled, waving their pints of Carlton Premium in my face. So I issued a challenge: their top eight comics against a random selection of talent from the rest of the world. An evil, smirking gleam appeared in the Australians' eyes: it was a competition . They like competitions here! </p> <p>Battle commenced with <b> Wil Anderson </b> (Aus) against <b> Chris Addison</b> (UK). Physically, they are similar types - young, skinny, tall, handsome - but with the natural tendencies of their respective nations... so Anderson is sinewy and tanned, like he's grown up playing beach volleyball, while Addison has pasty pipecleaner limbs of a kind only produced by English boys' schools. This contrast is misleading, however, as the weakling Brit easily overpowers his Aussie counterpart. Addison's penetrating and impassioned examination of Englishness, Cakes and Ale, has been hardened over eight months' touring and comprises enough material to fill two hours. Meanwhile, all Anderson's charm and skill cannot conceal the paucity of his material, which is lightweight, forgettable men-and-women stuff. Australia 0, Rest of the World 1 </p> <p>The next round involves two comedians who have written shows about their parents. <b> Rich Fulcher</b> (US) performs Mom, I'm Not A Lawyer , based on the true story of a whopping great lie. <b> Greg Fleet</b> (Aus) performs I Wish You Were D(e)ad, an hour of real-life anecdotes about his father - a small-time movie actor and bigamist who abandoned him at the age of 10 by faking his suicide. Both are strong concepts, but Fleet's is by far the more entertaining show, partly because he is 100 times more relaxed on stage and partly because he has thought at every stage of the writing process, 'How can I make this funny?' rather than just elegant and interesting. Australia 1, Rest of the World 1 </p> <p>Now we come to the musical section. <b> Max Sharam</b> is a former pop star in Australia - a one-album wonder who went to LA to make her fortune and has now returned as a sort of deranged cabaret comedienne. Her show, Mad'moselle Max, is billed as a work-in-progress. There are, accordingly, plenty of failed experiments, but Sharam has Factor X in such abundance that you can forgive her almost anything. Dressed as a slutty cleaning lady, she sings about boob jobs ('I've Got Two Under My Skin') and unrequited lust ('Shame He's Gay') in a voice that is part sex-kitten, part opera diva. Remorselessy quirky, she reminds me above all of Cyndi Lauper, and she would surely have won her homeland their second point had not she been paired with <b> Otis Lee Crenshaw</b> (US), ex-con country singer and the greatest live comedian on the face of the earth. Tough draw, Max. Australia 1, Rest of the World 2 </p> <p>Sensing that they are losing control of the match, Australia send out their brightest young hope, <b> Sarah Kendall</b>, a 24-year-old who looks like a supermodel and manages to produce a show without any hint of patriotism nor one single reference to the travails of 'being a woman'. War is an intelligent, witty discussion of two world wars, the Third Reich, Vietnam and the power of television. All this in 60 minutes, with no boring bits and lots of laughs. Amazing. Unfortunately for Australia, she was drawn against <b> Arj Barker</b> (Can). Halfway between Prince and Eddie Izzard, Barker has always been hugely talented and charming, but a year or two ago he seemed to be losing his way in terms of material. His new show, 2001: A Spaced Odyssey , boasts a magnificently weird image change (silver chainmail vest and inconceivably tight pants) and lots of fresh, sweet jokes. A glorious return to form, and enough to secure a valuable half-point. Australia 1 1/2, Rest of the World 2 1/2. </p> <p>Like Sharam, <b> Judith Lucy</b> (Aus) moved to LA in search of fame; unlike Sharam, she has neither charm nor musical ability, so she has to scrape together 90 minutes of relentlessly sarcastic observations about Hollywood celebrities. Her voice may grate (think Clive James crossed with Dame Edna) and her views on other nations may be predictably Oz-aggrandising ('Frankly, I'd rather shove a three-pronged fork up my arse than live in England'), but her brash, crude humour inevitably yields a few laughs. Lucky for Lucy, she is up against another 'clapped-out old slapper', <b> Jenny Eclair</b> (UK), whose latest effort lacks the thrilling conviction of her 1995 Perrier-winning show, Prozac and Tantrums . The result is stalemate. Australia 2, Rest of the World 3 </p> <p><b> Miss Itchy</b> (Aus) is a comic legend in Australia, which suggests that the nation's self-image as a straightforward, laidback, no-probs bunch of guys is a little misleading. Because Miss Itchy (aka rotund, foulmouthed Linda Haggar and Faehy Younger) is one of the most disturbing, least straightforward things I've ever seen. The show I saw was a rerun of 1996's I Can't Stop Burrowing, a prison play that lay somewhere between Benny Hill, Kafka, The Young Ones and Prisoner: Cell Block H . Profane, disorienting and oddly serious, it gave me nightmares. I can only be thankful I didn't see The Cr\u00e8me de Menthe Breakfast Show , featuring the 'cunt in the cage', which sounds horribly Freudian. Poor <b> Jeff Green</b> (UK), then, who looks bland and hackneyed next to Des O'Connor, never mind something this strange and dangerous. Australia 3, Rest of the World 3. </p> <p>So the decider is between <b> Adam Hills</b> (Aus), a comic so clean-cut, positive and relaxed he could be a national symbol, and <b> Dave Gorman</b> (UK), so understated, eccentric and original, he too could be a national symbol, were he not competing on behalf of the Rest of the World. </p> <p>Beneath that boyish visage, Hills is a tough competitor - his shows are hugely energetic, technically flawless and ruthlessly crowd-pleasing. He could easily have made it as a demagogic politician, a revivalist preacher or a door-to-door salesman. However, he is queasily patriotic ('maybe that's why Australians are doing so well, kicking ass all over the world') and cloyingly upbeat. Gorman, bless 'im, would never be so crass; his show - a quest to find all the other Dave Gormans on the planet - is a quiet exploration of human nature; the universe inside an anorak. Sorry, Australia, but there can only be one winner. Australia 3, Rest of the World 4.</p>",

The result is a kind of patriotic smugness, which does not make for great humour. When I mentioned this theory to some Aussies, they became annoyed and defensive. More to the point, they didn't believe me. Our comics are the best, they yelled, waving their pints of Carlton Premium in my face. So I issued a challenge: their top eight comics against a random selection of talent from the rest of the world. An evil, smirking gleam appeared in the Australians' eyes: it was a competition . They like competitions here! Battle commenced with Wil Anderson (Aus) against Chris Addison (UK). Physically, they are similar types - young, skinny, tall, handsome - but with the natural tendencies of their respective nations... so Anderson is sinewy and tanned, like he's grown up playing beach volleyball, while Addison has pasty pipecleaner limbs of a kind only produced by English boys' schools. This contrast is misleading, however, as the weakling Brit easily overpowers his Aussie counterpart. Addison's penetrating and impassioned examination of Englishness, Cakes and Ale, has been hardened over eight months' touring and comprises enough material to fill two hours. Meanwhile, all Anderson's charm and skill cannot conceal the paucity of his material, which is lightweight, forgettable men-and-women stuff. Australia 0, Rest of the World 1 The next round involves two comedians who have written shows about their parents. Rich Fulcher (US) performs Mom, I'm Not A Lawyer , based on the true story of a whopping great lie. Greg Fleet (Aus) performs I Wish You Were D(e)ad, an hour of real-life anecdotes about his father - a small-time movie actor and bigamist who abandoned him at the age of 10 by faking his suicide. Both are strong concepts, but Fleet's is by far the more entertaining show, partly because he is 100 times more relaxed on stage and partly because he has thought at every stage of the writing process, 'How can I make this funny?' rather than just elegant and interesting. Australia 1, Rest of the World 1 Now we come to the musical section. Max Sharam is a former pop star in Australia - a one-album wonder who went to LA to make her fortune and has now returned as a sort of deranged cabaret comedienne. Her show, Mad'moselle Max, is billed as a work-in-progress. There are, accordingly, plenty of failed experiments, but Sharam has Factor X in such abundance that you can forgive her almost anything. Dressed as a slutty cleaning lady, she sings about boob jobs ('I've Got Two Under My Skin') and unrequited lust ('Shame He's Gay') in a voice that is part sex-kitten, part opera diva. Remorselessy quirky, she reminds me above all of Cyndi Lauper, and she would surely have won her homeland their second point had not she been paired with Otis Lee Crenshaw (US), ex-con country singer and the greatest live comedian on the face of the earth. Tough draw, Max. Australia 1, Rest of the World 2 Sensing that they are losing control of the match, Australia send out their brightest young hope, Sarah Kendall, a 24-year-old who looks like a supermodel and manages to produce a show without any hint of patriotism nor one single reference to the travails of 'being a woman'. War is an intelligent, witty discussion of two world wars, the Third Reich, Vietnam and the power of television. All this in 60 minutes, with no boring bits and lots of laughs. Amazing. Unfortunately for Australia, she was drawn against Arj Barker (Can). Halfway between Prince and Eddie Izzard, Barker has always been hugely talented and charming, but a year or two ago he seemed to be losing his way in terms of material. His new show, 2001: A Spaced Odyssey , boasts a magnificently weird image change (silver chainmail vest and inconceivably tight pants) and lots of fresh, sweet jokes. A glorious return to form, and enough to secure a valuable half-point. Australia 1 1/2, Rest of the World 2 1/2. Like Sharam, Judith Lucy (Aus) moved to LA in search of fame; unlike Sharam, she has neither charm nor musical ability, so she has to scrape together 90 minutes of relentlessly sarcastic observations about Hollywood celebrities. Her voice may grate (think Clive James crossed with Dame Edna) and her views on other nations may be predictably Oz-aggrandising ('Frankly, I'd rather shove a three-pronged fork up my arse than live in England'), but her brash, crude humour inevitably yields a few laughs. Lucky for Lucy, she is up against another 'clapped-out old slapper', Jenny Eclair (UK), whose latest effort lacks the thrilling conviction of her 1995 Perrier-winning show, Prozac and Tantrums . The result is stalemate. Australia 2, Rest of the World 3 Miss Itchy (Aus) is a comic legend in Australia, which suggests that the nation's self-image as a straightforward, laidback, no-probs bunch of guys is a little misleading. Because Miss Itchy (aka rotund, foulmouthed Linda Haggar and Faehy Younger) is one of the most disturbing, least straightforward things I've ever seen. The show I saw was a rerun of 1996's I Can't Stop Burrowing, a prison play that lay somewhere between Benny Hill, Kafka, The Young Ones and Prisoner: Cell Block H . Profane, disorienting and oddly serious, it gave me nightmares. I can only be thankful I didn't see The Cr\u00e8me de Menthe Breakfast Show , featuring the 'cunt in the cage', which sounds horribly Freudian. Poor Jeff Green (UK), then, who looks bland and hackneyed next to Des O'Connor, never mind something this strange and dangerous. Australia 3, Rest of the World 3. So the decider is between Adam Hills (Aus), a comic so clean-cut, positive and relaxed he could be a national symbol, and Dave Gorman (UK), so understated, eccentric and original, he too could be a national symbol, were he not competing on behalf of the Rest of the World. Beneath that boyish visage, Hills is a tough competitor - his shows are hugely energetic, technically flawless and ruthlessly crowd-pleasing. He could easily have made it as a demagogic politician, a revivalist preacher or a door-to-door salesman. However, he is queasily patriotic ('maybe that's why Australians are doing so well, kicking ass all over the world') and cloyingly upbeat. Gorman, bless 'im, would never be so crass; his show - a quest to find all the other Dave Gormans on the planet - is a quiet exploration of human nature; the universe inside an anorak. Sorry, Australia, but there can only be one winner. Australia 3, Rest of the World 4.",

      "body": "<p>Edward Albee reminds me of an airline experiment that happened some years ago. The hostesses served passengers with raspberry-flavoured ice-cream. But it was coloured banana yellow. And no one could make out exactly what it tasted of. Albee's most famous work is still Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? Premiered in New York in 1962, it won the first of his three Pulitzer Prizes and in 1966 was filmed by Mike Nichols. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton played George and Martha, a pair of veteran marrieds armed to the teeth with intellectual savagery, emotionally stripping each other in front of a younger couple. The razor slashes of wit and extended alcoholic bouts of recrimination painted a husband and wife seemingly bent on mutual destruction. A-ha, the dull people thought, life imitating art. Albee the bitter chronicler of arid marriage.</p> <p>But revived three years ago in London with Diana Rigg and David Suchet in the title roles, you saw two people flexing their wit and intelligence in a heroic effort to make sense of being together and in the world. Theirs was a marriage that worked in its own terms, despite the collateral damage. And while certainly raw and emotionally naked, it emerged as a very funny play. In fact a love story. That is what Albee thinks too. Banana ice-cream tasting of raspberries.</p> <p>And if Albee himself, in London for the British premiere of two plays from the mid-Eighties, Finding the Sun and Marriage Play, didn't have a twinkle in his eye and a not-too-buried sense of humour, you could leave after an hour or so in his company thinking he was a bitter, unco-operative, thin-lipped queen. Actually he's rather a sweetie. Although he would probably hate anyone to know it. He hides it well behind the slight raising of an eyebrow. And meeting him leaves a nice taste in the mouth. 'Nice', oddly for such an intense writer, is a word he uses often. It seems an unconscious understatement, a very New England way to cap his emotions.</p> <p>One could say that Albee spent the Seventies and Eighties in both New York and London in a kind of critical oblivion, only to be rescued in 1994 by Three TallWomen. He just describes his rediscovery as 'nice' and of the play's success says only 'One prefers a yes to a no'. He is being deliberately obtuse. But he smiles, so that's OK.</p> <p>At 73, Albee is considerably older than he looks. He is lean, only ageing slightly when he walks. He looks as though someone has lent him Donny Osmond's teeth; they are too perfect. 'I had them done because when I was very poor living in The Village there was no dentistry and they rotted. I think I'm going to take them back to the guy and have him imperfect them a little bit, make them ragged.'</p> <p>For 32 years he has lived with a sculptor called Jonathan, who is younger than him. 'Almost everyone is,' he admits in an Eeyorish kind of way.</p> <p>Marriage Play and Finding the Sun, both directed by Anthony Page, who was responsible for his two recent London hits Three Tall Women and A Delicate Balance, are peopled by Albee's people. Men and women from his roots, the world of the New England American moneyed aristocracy which he so hated. They are the kind of men who cannot cry and the kind of women who wear sweaters on their shoulders so they cannot work.</p> <p>As a baby he was adopted by a millionaire couple, Reed and Frances Albee. She was 23 years younger than her husband, a foot taller and his third wife. Albee says: 'I did have a strong feeling of dislocation from the beginning. I never felt that I belonged to those people in that environment. They were deeply prejudiced and reactionary.' They must have felt the same way about him as he was disinherited after he left home at 18. Because he was gay? 'No, homosexuality was never discussed in the family. It was because I left. For God's sake if you buy a child, give it a good education and take care of it all those years, how dare it walk out on you?'</p> <p>Did they row? 'The reason I left was so silly. I arrived home very late from a night out in New York and a friend had thrown up in the station wagon. But I went straight to bed. The next morning my mother said, \"You arrived very late and someone left the lights on. They kept us awake.\" And I said, \"Well why didn't someone get up and turn them off?\" A conversation then ensued in which it was made quite clear that I should change my ways or leave. So I left. I knew I was going to. I do a lot of things intuitively.' Did you clean up the sick? 'No,' he says with an acknowledging grin, 'the servants did that.'</p> <p>Yet for all his rejection of these people and their values - he is a fervent Democrat, describing Bush as 'a heartbeat away from being President' - he embraces them in his plays and is himself something of the gentle patrician. He is a Wasp in both senses of the word, turning his stinging intelligence on his own people. Three Tall Women he readily admits was about his domineering mother. And although it's an excoriating portrait of the old girl, it feels not so much a revenge but a reconciliation after her death and with death itself.</p> <p>The physical territory of Finding the Sun is similar. Two young upper class women are married to two rich young men who were previously lovers. They have buried their sexuality in convention. Endlessly weary about being asked to expand on what he is saying in any of his plays, Albee sighs and eventually acknowledges that this one is 'about the responsibilities of being alive, of living fully and being your own person. What happens to poor Daniel and Benjamin is that they are trapped by social pressure.'</p> <p>It is bleak. Yet there is optimism. There is Fergus, a 16-year-old, oh-so-good-looking and preternaturally intelligent boy who wanders in and out of the play, which is set - conveniently for those who like to watch young men in swimwear - on a beach. 'He is a quizzical, sweet boy,' says Albee, entranced by his own creation. 'I like Fergus a lot. He's like all those boys I went to prep school with... my first loves. The skin of those kids...'</p> <p>Inevitably Fergus leaves the play after hearing a wistful speech by his mother saying that she doesn't want to around when, as Albee puts it, 'he will discover that all things are not possible.' In as much as one can pin Albee down, this illustrates one of the great atmospheres of his work. It's not bitterness or disillusion so much as that we live in danger of getting to the end of our lives and being disappointed. 'What could be worse,' he says, 'than getting to the end of your life and realising that you haven't fully participated?'</p> <p>Or, as he says about Marriage Play, in which more bitterly but more quietly than in Virginia Woolf, a couple - played in this new production by Sheila Gish and Bill Paterson - battle it out on the matrimonial turf: 'I suppose the conclusion of that play is that they have got to the stage where they realise that the final relationship in one's life is a form of dying.'</p> <p>Death is a great annoyance to Albee. 'I enjoy participating,' he says and continues in a typical quotable riff, 'and I disapprove of death. The only two things you can write about are life and death. The dread of reaching a certain age is that it will be interrupted and that one may not finish life.' It happens to the couple in A Delicate Balance who arrive at their friends' house gripped by an inchoate fear, which is little more than mortality. Yet despite his age and being in what he presumes will be his last relationship, Albee rejects the strictly autobiographical take on this.</p> <p>He fends it off sarcastically when you ask him why he doesn't want to die. 'Probably because I enjoy being alive.' Thanks for that. It's in a fairly long line of staccato put-downs that are only rescued by a sardonic smile, and which mask his warmth in the same way that first impressions of bitterness can overshadow the humanity of his work.</p> <p>The marriage in Marriage Play is not a bad marriage, he says, 'except for what's happening'. Ha, ha. 'They've had a good relationship, they enjoy each other's company, they make jokes together. It's better than a lot of marriages. They've just got to the stage where he has realised that in your last relationship maybe nothing has to be enough.' Ow.</p> <p>Does he see bitterness in everything? 'Yes I guess I do. Except when the sun comes out.' So are you sad and bitter? 'Oh, no. Not at all.' Edward Albee, raspberry and bananas.</p> <p>Finding the Sun/Marriage Play open at the National Theatre's Cottesloe on 8 May</p>",

What about Dublin, Lisbon or Ljubljana? And Newcastle and Gateshead, an invisibly hyphenated urban entity that's new to me, has taken to issuing press releases suggesting that it has 'Europe's largest temporary arts space'. </p> <p>How do they know? Where is the statistical authority that records such information, and are they sure that they have got the word temporary in the right place in the sentence? </p> <p>Every city struggling to make it out of the third division and into the second, latches on to the word Europe sooner or later. It is invariably emblazoned on the 'welcome to' signs at airports: 'Leeds: a European City'. Of course, it's meant to imply steely-eyed vision, matched with cultural achievement, rather than geography. As if to underscore the awkward mix of social unease and vainglory on which such claims are based, they are always delivered in the same triumphant tone: 'We have the tallest high-rise flats, the longest wall, the largest community of artists, the greatest social deprivation in Europe.' It doesn't matter if it's good or bad news, at least we have put ourselves on the map seems to be the line. </p> <p>Which is why ambitious cities are so keen on collaring a European title that looks so good on the municipal letterhead. None comes more sought after than the European Capital of Culture logo. It wasn't always this way. The days when culture was seen as decadence on the rates are not so long gone. </p> <p>The big difference since then has been the Glasgow effect. No doubt about it, Glasgow is a different place since it was European Capital of Culture. Ten years ago, it was still stuck with the razor gangs in the badlands stereotype. Now, despite the best efforts of the Daily Record to remind everybody about the city's heroin-soaked housing estates, Glasgow is better off, and more confident about itself than it has been for half a century. </p> <p>No wonder that Birmingham and Newcastle, Liverpool and Bristol and all the rest are lining up to repeat the trick in 2008, the next time Britain gets a shot at the title. But if they are looking to pull off the same regenera tion-through-culture trick as Glasgow, the title is not worth having. It has become meaningless by dint of sheer repetition. </p> <p>The idea of a capital of anything runs counter to Chris Smith's line on partnership and ethnic quotas in museums. In its nature, it's \u00e9litist. It's setting out to make one place get the limelight and it runs against a lot of ingrained ideology about the arts. But in this particular case, \u00e9litism works. When I found myself in Glasgow trying to run a year of architecture in 1999, in the wake of the Capital of Culture programme, the first thing people started saying was: 'Let's be nice to the losers. Let's do the year in partnership with Liverpool and Edinburgh.' But what on earth is the point of having a capital of anything if you are going to dilute its impact by spreading it thinly all over everything? </p> <p>But this is exactly what the European Union has done with the Capitals of Culture programme. It declared no less than seven cities of culture for 2000. This year is equally dotty: there are two capitals of culture - Rotterdam and Porto. </p> <p>There will only be one Glasgow; the British cities lining up to follow in its footsteps will have to make do with culture for culture's sake. But I don't think that is what Councillor Bore, leader of Birmingham City Council, will have in mind when he unveils Birmingham's bid for the title this week. He has his eyes on jobs and investment. </p> <p>And there is nothing wrong with that, but if we are really looking for means of economic renewal through cultural regeneration, it's time to put the old cultural capital warhorse out of its misery and start again with something fresher.</p>",

What about Dublin, Lisbon or Ljubljana? And Newcastle and Gateshead, an invisibly hyphenated urban entity that's new to me, has taken to issuing press releases suggesting that it has 'Europe's largest temporary arts space'. How do they know? Where is the statistical authority that records such information, and are they sure that they have got the word temporary in the right place in the sentence? Every city struggling to make it out of the third division and into the second, latches on to the word Europe sooner or later. It is invariably emblazoned on the 'welcome to' signs at airports: 'Leeds: a European City'. Of course, it's meant to imply steely-eyed vision, matched with cultural achievement, rather than geography. As if to underscore the awkward mix of social unease and vainglory on which such claims are based, they are always delivered in the same triumphant tone: 'We have the tallest high-rise flats, the longest wall, the largest community of artists, the greatest social deprivation in Europe.' It doesn't matter if it's good or bad news, at least we have put ourselves on the map seems to be the line. Which is why ambitious cities are so keen on collaring a European title that looks so good on the municipal letterhead. None comes more sought after than the European Capital of Culture logo. It wasn't always this way. The days when culture was seen as decadence on the rates are not so long gone. The big difference since then has been the Glasgow effect. No doubt about it, Glasgow is a different place since it was European Capital of Culture. Ten years ago, it was still stuck with the razor gangs in the badlands stereotype. Now, despite the best efforts of the Daily Record to remind everybody about the city's heroin-soaked housing estates, Glasgow is better off, and more confident about itself than it has been for half a century. No wonder that Birmingham and Newcastle, Liverpool and Bristol and all the rest are lining up to repeat the trick in 2008, the next time Britain gets a shot at the title. But if they are looking to pull off the same regenera tion-through-culture trick as Glasgow, the title is not worth having. It has become meaningless by dint of sheer repetition. The idea of a capital of anything runs counter to Chris Smith's line on partnership and ethnic quotas in museums. In its nature, it's \u00e9litist. It's setting out to make one place get the limelight and it runs against a lot of ingrained ideology about the arts. But in this particular case, \u00e9litism works. When I found myself in Glasgow trying to run a year of architecture in 1999, in the wake of the Capital of Culture programme, the first thing people started saying was: 'Let's be nice to the losers. Let's do the year in partnership with Liverpool and Edinburgh.' But what on earth is the point of having a capital of anything if you are going to dilute its impact by spreading it thinly all over everything? But this is exactly what the European Union has done with the Capitals of Culture programme. It declared no less than seven cities of culture for 2000. This year is equally dotty: there are two capitals of culture - Rotterdam and Porto. There will only be one Glasgow; the British cities lining up to follow in its footsteps will have to make do with culture for culture's sake. But I don't think that is what Councillor Bore, leader of Birmingham City Council, will have in mind when he unveils Birmingham's bid for the title this week. He has his eyes on jobs and investment. And there is nothing wrong with that, but if we are really looking for means of economic renewal through cultural regeneration, it's time to put the old cultural capital warhorse out of its misery and start again with something fresher.",

Centre stage is Neil Finn, hair greying but still a hint of that haphazard Crowded House quiff, a wisecracking ringleader for the musical circus around him. On his right, the almost impossibly tall Ed O'Brien from Radiohead. To his left, the long-lost British guitar hero Johnny Marr, wearing a shaggy Liam Gallagher haircut. Ponytailed bass player Sebastian Steinberg, from New York avant-garde rock group Soul Coughing, alternates between upright and electric bass. Occasionally, Eddie Vedder from Pearl Jam takes to the stage, throwing himself at the microphone. At the rear, multi-instrumentalist Lisa Germano and Radiohead's drummer Phil Selway lurk in the shadows. </p> <p>Welcome to Neil Finn's 'Seven Worlds Collide', a five-night run in New Zealand's recently renovated St James Theatre. It's much more than a launch for the former Crowded House leader's solo album, One Nil, his second since the band's demise. Here, for one week only, is a catch-them-while-you-can supergroup. </p> <p>The five shows have been preceded by four days of 12-hour rehearsals in a barn at Karekare, the wave-swept west Auckland village where Jane Campion's The Piano was filmed. It's a rushed itinerary - Johnny Marr only managed to make it for a day of rehearsals and there were 40 songs to learn, from Crowded House classics to songs on One Nil to dusty old Split Enz tunes. </p> <p>But any rough edges have been smoothed out by the time the band hits the stage for this fifth gig after Finn's solo opening gesture of Crowded House's plaintive anthem, 'When You Come'. What follows is three-and-a-half hours of the stuff that makes you fall in love with your record collection all over again. </p> <p>Sometimes, it's almost too much. On 'Suffer Never', the gritty highlight from 1995's Finn brothers album, Finn, Ed O'Brien turns the song into a slice of apocalyptic guitar meltdown. And Vedder's rush through Pearl Jam's own live favourite, 'Better Man', sees Phil Selway pounding the drumkit in a manner he hasn't needed to do in Radiohead for a long time. </p> <p>When Marr starts into the Smiths' classic 'There Is a Light', with Neil Finn managing a sweeter approximation of Morrissey's drone, the excitement is intense. Two hours later, the impossible happens; after mumbling that he's hasn't played the song for a while, Marr begins the pulsating opening to 'How Soon Is Now'. O'Brien, who'll later drunkenly gush in a backroom bar that Marr is one of the reasons he picked up a guitar, adds the spine-tingling distortion. And when Neil's son, Liam, takes to the stage with his band, Betchadupa, for the Split Enz classics 'I Got You', 'History Never Repeats' and 'I See Red', it's with Vedder singing them, careering around the stage to songs that have become staples at every beach barbecue and Saturday night party in New Zealand for the last 20 years. A few days after the gig, Finn says the moment he saw Liam playing 'I Got You' was the highlight of the week, especially as he'd had to calm his son's nerves before he hit the stage. 'It was magic for me - here's a song I'd written before Liam was born, and there's his band playing it, rocking up a storm.' </p> <p>Finn's plan for the extravaganza came late last year: he and O'Brien had been longtime friends since meeting at a festival in the Crowded House days, Germano and Steinberg had played on One Nil and Johnny Marr and Finn had met at Linda McCartney's memorial concert in 1998. Vedder has gone on record as saying Split Enz made his life bearable as a mixed-up kid in California. </p> <p>Finn says: 'We all felt really moved by the week, because we proved that with a really strong will you can become a band. The fact that it was five nights was a great thing because it meant that we could develop - it wasn't a one-off all-star occasion.' </p> <p>It's not often you can find seven such strong personalities playing on a stage and giving each other room, and that's not lost on the man behind it all. It was, he says, fondly, five nights of 'charms and delights'. </p> <p>'Ed was just expressing that what he liked about this was that it had a certain joyfulness about it.' He's not joking. A few hours after the last gig ends, Ed O'Brien is what you could adequately describe as emotional at the after-show party, still coming down to earth after the week.

One's a TV weatherman - loud, confident, prosperous, often pictured importantly in front of a globe; the other's a timid, constantly defeated 'cultural philosopher', bent on examining the effect of science and, particularly, the space race on popular culture. </p> <p>They're attached to and wary of each other. Each is the other's far side of the moon, as distant as Russians were from Americans in the Sixties. And each is a version of the director. In a canny, critically pre-emptive move, Lepage has put on stage the extremes of his theatrical personality - the showman and the hippy free-associator. </p> <p>The droll precision of the sibling scenes, in which both sides are as ridiculous as they are touching, is a sur prise from the not pernickertly realistic Lepage. But they're only half his point. At the back of the action, a sequence of images peels back layers from everyday life, making unsuspected, dashing connections; domestic tasks take on an extraterrestrial tinge. </p> <p>While you watch a man entering a launderette, you see black-and-white film of the Soviet space programme; gradually, you notice the similarity between the round doors of the washing-machines, the portholes of a cabin and the helmets of cosmonauts. You look at the slow tumble of clothes inside the machines and recognise the weightless drifting of spacemen. </p> <p>An infant-sized puppet, swaddled like a spaceman, swims out of one of those portholes. As he does so, you hear childish gurgles, listen to a news announcement about man's first walk in space and realise once again how much those early cosmonauts looked like babies, bouncing along with their outsize globular heads and trailing umbilical cords. </p> <p>A man calls for a lift - the bleep of the button sounds like the chirrup of Sputnik circling Earth. A man gets trapped in a lift, as sealed off from his world as if he were in a space capsule. What, Lepage asks, without ever clumpingly putting the important question into words, is so strange about strange? The show moves to Glasgow's Tramway this week and to the National in July. </p> <p>Energy cracks like a whip across the stage in the scary, smouldering, breakthrough piece from Frantic Assembly. Frantic call themselves a 'physical theatre' group, and though this is usually an irritating term (how could a theatre piece not be physical?), it's not hard to make out its meaning in <strong> Underworld</strong>. Gesture is used here not simply to colour or inflect the dialogue, but to tell a different kind of story. </p> <p>In the opening moments of Underworld , all you see on the almost bare stage, hung with long banners, glowing with deep contrasts of warm light and dark shadow, dominated by a huge wardrobe, resounding to a thumping beat, are disjointed gestures. Unidentified feet poke up from the end of a bath, then slither down; an unknown body slides downwards across a bed. Everything is strobed. </p> <p>When talk breaks in, it's at first so desultory that it sounds like improvisation. In the past, members of the audience have complained on discovering that what they'd thought of as confessional material was in fact made up. But then things tighten. What unfolds - and this is the breakthrough - is an old-fashioned (that's to say, tight and exciting) horror story given wings by a supple gymnastic technique. In the absence of words, there is never silence. </p> <p>Four young women, two of them sisters, gather together in an isolated house. A murder has taken place and one of them suffers from nightmares. The others cluster around, apparently protectively, but the seance they have is creepy, gloriously so for the audience, when the candlelit table starts to revolve in the twilight. They have a frightening excursion; even their v Bridget Jones, v funny exchanges take on a threatening edge. The night ends in bloodshed and in a fight, danced with terrific, sinister muscularity. </p> <p>The sheer physical agility of the all-female cast allows an all-encompassing weirdness: a figure can loll in the bottom of the wardrobe with her limbs rucked up like those of an abandoned puppet; a character will chat away while standing on the top of that cliff-like wardrobe and then jump from its heights, as if walking over a doorstep.

      "body": "<p><strong> Migrations</strong> The New Art Gallery Walsall, until 10 June </p> <p> Sebastiao Salgado worked for a doctorate in political economics in Brazil and Paris as a young man and, in a way, he has stayed true to that vocation. His extraordinary journalism deals in what auditors of nations call 'macro': he is the first truly global photographer. His last major project, Workers, depicted desperate, distant tribes of labourers united on the margins of world capitalism. His latest project, Migrations, is no less ambitious. It is a profound survey of the mass movement of refugees in our time, which has seen the displacement of people on a scale unprecedented in history. Salgado attempts to take full account of this wandering nation of 100 million migrants, and to measure the balance of payments it exacts on the collective human spirit. </p> <p>In the seven years he has been taking these photographs he has turned himself into something of a multinational, too. Having left the photographers' co-operative Magnum in 1994 ('if I stay,' Salgado observed melodramatically at the time, 'I die'), he established a worldwide agency, Amazonas, to deal with only his own work. The franchise is proving effective. The new gallery in Walsall is one of 16 venues in which this appropriately itinerant exhibition will be seen across the globe. There are two vast volumes of photographs in book form to accompany the touring show - 100,000 copies of each have been published in six languages - as well as a multilingual website (www.sebastiaosalgado.com.br). </p> <p>No other person on the planet, you guess, has come as close to the world's restless upheaval in the past decade, and none has been so resourceful in bringing its reality to the attention of the 'stable' nations. </p> <p>What strikes you most immediately about Salgado's work, then, is the sheer scale of the endeavour: he has travelled to 35 countries, most of them in extremis, to create this portrait of a stateless people. The surprise, perhaps, is the fact that looking at the compendious drama that has resulted is not simply overwhelming. Though he seeks to delineate the kind of population movements that might be indi cated by broad arrows in a text book, Salgado never fails to give his contemporary history paintings a complex, immediate human face. One effect of his pictures is to place the viewer intimately within ethnic groups - Kurds, Palestinians, Bosnians - whose names have become easy journalistic shorthand for displacement and return to them some of their individual humanity. </p> <p>The constant companion to most of the people photographed, the event they all have in common, is the road itself. It acts as a metaphor for both despair and hope, and mostly it seems to go on for ever. From Mozambique there is a photograph of a woman scaling a vast road bridge, her bed-roll on her head, her child on her back. When Salgado asked how far she had left to go, she replied quietly that she was walking to Maputo, 750 miles away. </p> <p>Sometimes it is enough that the road leads anywhere but here - 800,000 people have left Vietnam by boat since 1975, desperate enough to let winds and currents decide their destination - and, in some cases, it becomes the closest approximation to home. In 1995, for example, Salgado photographed hundreds of Muslim refugees in Croatia who had been forced to construct a life for themselves on a train without a destination: 'not victims of rape, torture or ethnic cleansing,' his caption explains, 'they had fled their homes before the atrocities reached them, so they had not earned the right to migrate...'; instead they sat for weeks and months in a siding, watching the world, with its timetable, rumble by. </p> <p>Salgado's camera recognises no boundaries so in the midst of this project, not surprisingly, he recalled: 'At times I wasn't sure if I was in Mexico City or Manila.' But for the people he depicts, the world's borders could hardly be more defined, or more arbitrary. At some point in each of the narratives of escape every one comes up against the barbed wire that defends our world against the desperation they represent. In a featureless scrub desert outside Tijuana two men peer through a huge metal fence at a possible future in the featureless scrub desert on the other side: America. In Morocco, refugees from famine and civil war in the Sudan, who have travelled much of the way on foot, find themselves living in the shells of cars in a portside wrecker's yard, losing hope daily of a passage to Spain. </p> <p>Interviewed about his project soon after it was completed, Salgado said: 'I once had political beliefs, I thought there were answers. I am no longer sure.' The pictures bear out this doubt. At times they seem to search in vain for a proper sense of scale, for a way of containing the subject. However far the photographer steps back from the problem, looking for context, further and further into the mountains or across the plain, the random geometries of the aimless and stateless still fill his frame. </p> <p>Life and death both become problems of logistics in this global no man's land: bulldozers struggle to bury the mounds of corpses of Rwandan refugees in Zaire while aid workers attempt to get food to a million starving survivors. When Salgado closes in again, however, there seem to be more hopeless stories than the world could contain: a sharp-eyed money lender with a fat wad of dollars is picked out among the dead and dying; mothers observe a morning ritual of strapping false limbs on to sons and daughters. </p> <p>As an extended footnote to his reporting, Salgado collected a gallery of portraits of children from each place he visited. The pictures were taken as a necessity - 'When I was with refugees from Mozambique,' he explained, 'there were children everywhere, stopping me from working. So I said: \"If you want to be photographed, line up here. Then you let me work, OK.\"' - but still they have a restless intensity. This singularity is heightened by proximity to the photographs of some of the 4,000 orphan toddlers who compete for space at a single SOS shelter in Zaire, or the battalion of abandoned babies tumbling over one another on the roof of a makeshift care home in S\u00e3o Paolo. </p> <p>In Paris, where photojournalists are revered as semi-mythical beings, these pictures created a furore when published. In Le Monde Salgado stood accused of 'sentimental voyeurism' and 'exploitation of compassion'. There are always problems, of course, in finding beauty in suffering, but even in his portraits Salgado never comes close to crossing a line into manipulation or sentimentality. The photographs are hard won from places most of us would never want to see at first hand, and they let us begin to imagine, for an instant, what it might be like to be on broken railway tracks and in pathless forests and adrift on swollen rivers - anywhere going nowhere fast. His own argument for his work, in the face of this criticism, was a simple one: 'I take photographs the way I see them, with the light I have known, with the life I have had.' It is a light and a life that recasts the world.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Cleopatra of Egypt</strong> British Museum, London WC1, until 26 August </p> <p> Interpretation - as this exhibition makes clear - is a nice excuse for indulging pet prejudices. We know little enough for certain about Cleopatra, which frees us to think whatever we please. </p> <p>As a mythical character, she is the sum total of all the contradictory stories told about her. A racial outsider, stigmatised by Augustan Rome, or a triumphant feminist, ensnaring Caesar and bullying Mark Antony? An irresistible enchantress, as for romantic painters like Delacroix, or simply 'the wickedest woman in history' as Cecil B. de Mille salaciously called her? Shakespeare's play perhaps gets closest to the mercurial muddle that surrounds her: his Cleopatra has a different persona - siren, shrew, tomboy, high priestess - in every scene. </p> <p>At the British Museum, the iconographic puzzle begins with a series of choices about what she looked like. There is no firm evidence. Despite her sensual reputa tion, Plutarch reported that her chief charm was her conversation, and contemporary coins lumber her with an unprepossessingly beaky nose. The exhibition lines up a row of statuesque images of this absent being, and asks you to select a white goddess or a black beauty. A head in marble makes her look wise, calm, classically reasonable; a full-length figure in basalt, wearing a peekaboo sheath and clutching a cornucopia, is an emblem of baleful, savage erotic power. </p> <p>If the contrast between white marble and black basalt seems too schematic, there is also a head in porous yellow limestone: an earth mother with luscious, gobbling lips. Another head from Delos reverts to the official numismatic profile, emphasising the high cheekbones and sniffing, suspicious nose of a martinet and closing down the lush mouth into a mean, strict line. Caricatures depict the orgiastic afterlife of the love goddess. In a Roman terracotta lamp, she squats to impale herself on a columnar penis which has conveniently sprouted from the tail of a crocodile. </p> <p>Shakespeare's Cleopatra declares herself a deity, purged of all 'baser elements'. Divinities of course can misbehave with impunity, and don't need to be democratically accountable: playing Cleopatra in Joseph Mankiewicz's film, a rampaging Elizabeth Taylor tells Richard Burton's Antony to ignore the senate, and shrills 'Gods are not elected!' The exhibition follows this passage from history to myth, and documents Cleopatra's posthumous conquest of the entire world. As ruler of Mauretania, she wears an elephant scalp. Returning to Egypt after Caesar's assassination, she is gradually Africanised, even though she was a Hellenistic monarch who never saw a sphinx or a pyramid. </p> <p>Because every society has its own ideas about her, she is claimed by cultures in which she did not belong and reconceived by historical periods which have new ideas about the eternal female. Fifteenth-century illustrations to Boccaccio concentrate on her sinfulness and the self-imposed penalty of suicide: in one of these, she attaches two leathery pythons - not thin, flickering asps - to her breasts, and has them gorge on the nipples. In the 1740s Tiepolo, painting the banquet she laid on for Antony, saw her as a rococo aristocrat, unacquainted with the dark continent, and gave her blonde hair and milky skin. This might be the Cleopatra of Handel's opera about Caesar's Egyptian campaign, first performed in 1724: a frivolously alluring coloratura soprano, no longer liable to Boccaccio's accusations of lechery and greed. </p> <p>A little later, Angelica Kaufmann painted a more romantic Cleopatra, an implausible model of connubial loyalty who visits Antony's tomb with a memorial garland of flowers. By the end of the nineteenth century she had changed again, and was now represented as a devouring ogre. Th\u00e9ophile Gautier wrote a feverish account of her gaudy nights, and the painter Alexandre Cabanel showed her listlessly petting a leopard while watching as the slaves on whom she is trying out poison contort in agony at her feet. </p> <p>Aptly, the first Cleopatra on film was vampily played by Theda Bara, whose name was an anagram for Arab Death. </p> <p>Cleopatra astutely marketed her own image, associating herself with the worship of Isis. Among the titles she gave herself was Philadelphia, which means brother-loving: there was a certain justice to this boast, since she married two of her own brothers. </p> <p>Because she controlled her own propaganda and publicity, it's not surprising to find her being merchandised all over again in 1934, when Cecil B. de Mille's film about her - with Claudette Colbert as a giggling hoyden who belches during the banquet with Antony - went on release. A press book alerted cinema managers to the range of Cleopatra-branded trophies they could tout: belts, make-up compacts, cigarette cases. Advertisements invited women to 'frame your face with lovely curls' in imitation of Colbert's skittish queen. </p> <p>Three decades later, when Elizabeth Taylor became the new face of Cleopatra, the coiffure being sold changed once more: Taylor's black hair, ironed flat, defined the new look of the 1960s. A pity that Twentieth Century Fox cut short this history by refusing to allow the museum any images from the Taylor film. </p> <p>The American artist and poet Barbara Chase-Reboud has created a Cleopatra for our own mercenary times, fabricating a contract for her third marriage: a maze of hieroglyphic legalese scribbled in a volume of hand-made parchment, from which dangle an onerous fringe of waxen seals, talismans and good-luck charms. Snakes coil across the paper, and marginal sketches of pyramids fill out the catalogue of marital assets. This is a Cleopatra who clearly drove a hard bargain during discussions of the pre-nuptial agreement. </p> <p>And the BM has recruited an even more modish and slangily local Cleopatra, who will be bringing the archetype up to date at a lecture on 19 May: our own version of the fatal woman is Tracey Emin, fresh from the Cairo Biennale and a cruise down the Nile. Will she, I wonder, be adorned with dung-beetles and have adders wriggling out of her cleavage? </p> <p>If you want to know the answer, tickets for her performance cost \u00a35. Carrying on as Cleopatra continues to be good business.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cleopatra of Egypt British Museum, London WC1, until 26 August Interpretation - as this exhibition makes clear - is a nice excuse for indulging pet prejudices. We know little enough for certain about Cleopatra, which frees us to think whatever we please. As a mythical character, she is the sum total of all the contradictory stories told about her. A racial outsider, stigmatised by Augustan Rome, or a triumphant feminist, ensnaring Caesar and bullying Mark Antony? An irresistible enchantress, as for romantic painters like Delacroix, or simply 'the wickedest woman in history' as Cecil B. de Mille salaciously called her? Shakespeare's play perhaps gets closest to the mercurial muddle that surrounds her: his Cleopatra has a different persona - siren, shrew, tomboy, high priestess - in every scene. At the British Museum, the iconographic puzzle begins with a series of choices about what she looked like. There is no firm evidence. Despite her sensual reputa tion, Plutarch reported that her chief charm was her conversation, and contemporary coins lumber her with an unprepossessingly beaky nose. The exhibition lines up a row of statuesque images of this absent being, and asks you to select a white goddess or a black beauty. A head in marble makes her look wise, calm, classically reasonable; a full-length figure in basalt, wearing a peekaboo sheath and clutching a cornucopia, is an emblem of baleful, savage erotic power. If the contrast between white marble and black basalt seems too schematic, there is also a head in porous yellow limestone: an earth mother with luscious, gobbling lips. Another head from Delos reverts to the official numismatic profile, emphasising the high cheekbones and sniffing, suspicious nose of a martinet and closing down the lush mouth into a mean, strict line. Caricatures depict the orgiastic afterlife of the love goddess. In a Roman terracotta lamp, she squats to impale herself on a columnar penis which has conveniently sprouted from the tail of a crocodile. Shakespeare's Cleopatra declares herself a deity, purged of all 'baser elements'. Divinities of course can misbehave with impunity, and don't need to be democratically accountable: playing Cleopatra in Joseph Mankiewicz's film, a rampaging Elizabeth Taylor tells Richard Burton's Antony to ignore the senate, and shrills 'Gods are not elected!' The exhibition follows this passage from history to myth, and documents Cleopatra's posthumous conquest of the entire world. As ruler of Mauretania, she wears an elephant scalp. Returning to Egypt after Caesar's assassination, she is gradually Africanised, even though she was a Hellenistic monarch who never saw a sphinx or a pyramid. Because every society has its own ideas about her, she is claimed by cultures in which she did not belong and reconceived by historical periods which have new ideas about the eternal female. Fifteenth-century illustrations to Boccaccio concentrate on her sinfulness and the self-imposed penalty of suicide: in one of these, she attaches two leathery pythons - not thin, flickering asps - to her breasts, and has them gorge on the nipples. In the 1740s Tiepolo, painting the banquet she laid on for Antony, saw her as a rococo aristocrat, unacquainted with the dark continent, and gave her blonde hair and milky skin. This might be the Cleopatra of Handel's opera about Caesar's Egyptian campaign, first performed in 1724: a frivolously alluring coloratura soprano, no longer liable to Boccaccio's accusations of lechery and greed. A little later, Angelica Kaufmann painted a more romantic Cleopatra, an implausible model of connubial loyalty who visits Antony's tomb with a memorial garland of flowers. By the end of the nineteenth century she had changed again, and was now represented as a devouring ogre. Th\u00e9ophile Gautier wrote a feverish account of her gaudy nights, and the painter Alexandre Cabanel showed her listlessly petting a leopard while watching as the slaves on whom she is trying out poison contort in agony at her feet. Aptly, the first Cleopatra on film was vampily played by Theda Bara, whose name was an anagram for Arab Death. Cleopatra astutely marketed her own image, associating herself with the worship of Isis. Among the titles she gave herself was Philadelphia, which means brother-loving: there was a certain justice to this boast, since she married two of her own brothers. Because she controlled her own propaganda and publicity, it's not surprising to find her being merchandised all over again in 1934, when Cecil B. de Mille's film about her - with Claudette Colbert as a giggling hoyden who belches during the banquet with Antony - went on release. A press book alerted cinema managers to the range of Cleopatra-branded trophies they could tout: belts, make-up compacts, cigarette cases. Advertisements invited women to 'frame your face with lovely curls' in imitation of Colbert's skittish queen. Three decades later, when Elizabeth Taylor became the new face of Cleopatra, the coiffure being sold changed once more: Taylor's black hair, ironed flat, defined the new look of the 1960s. A pity that Twentieth Century Fox cut short this history by refusing to allow the museum any images from the Taylor film. The American artist and poet Barbara Chase-Reboud has created a Cleopatra for our own mercenary times, fabricating a contract for her third marriage: a maze of hieroglyphic legalese scribbled in a volume of hand-made parchment, from which dangle an onerous fringe of waxen seals, talismans and good-luck charms. Snakes coil across the paper, and marginal sketches of pyramids fill out the catalogue of marital assets. This is a Cleopatra who clearly drove a hard bargain during discussions of the pre-nuptial agreement. And the BM has recruited an even more modish and slangily local Cleopatra, who will be bringing the archetype up to date at a lecture on 19 May: our own version of the fatal woman is Tracey Emin, fresh from the Cairo Biennale and a cruise down the Nile. Will she, I wonder, be adorned with dung-beetles and have adders wriggling out of her cleavage? If you want to know the answer, tickets for her performance cost \u00a35. Carrying on as Cleopatra continues to be good business.",

The key to Sigur Ros's post-rock rapture is that while you can't understand what he's saying, you always feel you know what he means.</p> <p>That one of the freshest bands to have emerged in a while should come from Iceland doesn't surprise us anymore, not since Bj\u00f6rk and the Sugarcubes and various contemporaries like GusGus first established the nation's talent for vivid, non-conformist pop.

The tiny 250,000 population is perhaps equally important. 'It's a small place, so things get jumbled up and having clearly defined boundaries is difficult,' is how he puts it. Ergo, the kind of tribal purism that always defined our culture is not possible in theirs. For instance, Birgisson, who carries the disarming expression of a naughty child caught with his hand in the biscuit tin, will tell you that his favourite vocalists are Leonard Cohen and the jazz trumpeter Chet Baker.</p> <p>Holm will mention Cohen, too, explaining: 'I never considered him depressing or sad; I always thought of him as uplifting.' (This is a very Scandanavian sentiment; for one Icelandic reviewer, Sigur Ros were so beautiful in concert that she had to run to the lavatory to throw up.)</p> <p>But if you inquire as to whether he listened to classical music as well, he looks at you as if you've just asked whether it ever gets chilly in Reykjavik.

Still all 25 or under, Sigur Ros have been together for seven years, variously working in child-care centres, TV studios, steel works and homes for severely disabled people, or studying politics at university, to survive along the way. They've spent the past few years as their country's most popular home-grown band, thanks in particular to that second album, Agaetis Byrjun - which, despite being sporadically inspired, still gets nowhere near capturing their live magic. The alien quality of their sound owes more than a little to vocalist Jonsi Birgisson's penchant for singing in a mixture of Icelandic and a tongue of his own invention, which he likes to call 'Hopelandish'. The key to Sigur Ros's post-rock rapture is that while you can't understand what he's saying, you always feel you know what he means. That one of the freshest bands to have emerged in a while should come from Iceland doesn't surprise us anymore, not since Bj\u00f6rk and the Sugarcubes and various contemporaries like GusGus first established the nation's talent for vivid, non-conformist pop. Nevertheless, the present crop looks to be particularly promising, with Sigur Ros being closely followed by the brilliant Blake, Mum, Kanada and old Blur favourites, Lhooq. All are helped by an active but compact music business, whose infrastructure they control. Record company accountants and the stifling short-termism they bring hold no sway over what goes on. Hilmar Hilmarsson, a doyen of the Reykjavik scene, cites the country's long domination by Denmark as a factor in the delight his people seem to take in creativity and invention. Sigur Ros's articulate bass player, Georg Holm, will add that there are no surviving folk instruments. Indigenous music is vocal and you wonder whether the characteristically Icelandic willingness to make mischief with genres and stylistic conven tion owes something to this. The tiny 250,000 population is perhaps equally important. 'It's a small place, so things get jumbled up and having clearly defined boundaries is difficult,' is how he puts it. Ergo, the kind of tribal purism that always defined our culture is not possible in theirs. For instance, Birgisson, who carries the disarming expression of a naughty child caught with his hand in the biscuit tin, will tell you that his favourite vocalists are Leonard Cohen and the jazz trumpeter Chet Baker. Holm will mention Cohen, too, explaining: 'I never considered him depressing or sad; I always thought of him as uplifting.' (This is a very Scandanavian sentiment; for one Icelandic reviewer, Sigur Ros were so beautiful in concert that she had to run to the lavatory to throw up.) But if you inquire as to whether he listened to classical music as well, he looks at you as if you've just asked whether it ever gets chilly in Reykjavik. Eventually, he replies: 'Yeah, yeah.'

Big Brother, Kevin and Perry and American Pie are a small, unappetising sampling of film and television. Not a lot is left to the imagination and surely fantasy is a tool for growing up?</p> <p>As I grew up, my father taught me to use my imagination. When I was older, he moulded me to have 'sparky' thoughts and when I wrote my first children's books, he tutored me on intertwining reality with creativity. Never too much information, allow young minds to smoulder with vision and ideas. But then the internet came along. Information became highly accessible, an awful lot of information. It was less acceptable to have subtlety and no longer is less more. Yet it seems the teenage novel is embracing this medium and has far greater appeal than the offerings of the Nineties. Teasing your reader is a tool of the past. </p> <p>Luckily, the pre-teens of the Nineties were fortunate enough to be weaned on C.S. Lewis, Anne Fine, Dahl and then J.K. Rowling, so at least they learnt slowly to scale reality with a knapsack full of imagination. The lowest ebb of children's novels (or books for young adults) was at the end of the twentieth century. Then the average sale of a hardback novel was about 800 copies; today, it is at least double that. Harry Potter was the catalyst for this and J.K. Rowling is by far the cleverest of our new authors, as she interprets real-life sagas and interweaves them with fantasy. The Harry Potter books take elements from C.S Lewis, E. Nesbit, Dahl and even Enid Blyton's Far Away Tree. Each of these authors overemphasise the injustices of our world through wildly imaginative fantasy.</p> <p>Are we are now witnessing the aftershock of the reality genre, the internet and other 'in your face' raw messages? It seems suspicious to me that Scholastic, Rowling's publishers in the US, reports that 40 per cent of its readers are adults and the majority of them are single. Philip Pullman's books are being followed by David Almond and Jacqueline Wills in seeming equally popular with adults, despite the claim that they are written for the less mature reader. So are these books really an accurate representation of what a teenage novel is or, indeed, what teenagers want?</p> <p>In the past few weeks, I have read four books which were written for 'young adults'. It 's been an exhausting process, with no escape. In <strong>Shylock's Daughter</strong> (Macmillan \u00a34.99, pp272), I felt discomfited by the clear message of Jewish victimisation by Christian society. Mirjam Pressler, the author, is shameless in her telling of Jessica's story from the ghettos to 'marrying out' into the Venetian nobility. This novel, though based on the Shakespeare play, presents the unhappy lot which befell Shylock's family at the hands of Antonio and Lorenzo's anti-Semitism. In the summing up by Brian Murdoch, the translator, the young reader is given little choice but to conclude that Jessica will reap only unhappiness through her Christian marriage: 'I did it of my own free will and I will have to take the consequences.'</p> <p>Family dysfunction and obsession overwhelmed me in Jan Mark's <strong>The Lady with Iron Bones</strong> (Walker Books \u00a39.99, pp159). The sadness of Casey's home life (her mother has postnatal depression, her father has left home, her brother has disappeared to find her father while her baby brother is allegedly 'backward') causes her to pray to a statue, the Lady with Iron Bones, which, in reality, is a birdbath in a neighbour's garden. </p> <p>Once her prayers are seem to be answered, she becomes obsessed, worshipping the statue and rewarding it with her few precious gifts. Ultimately, Casey becomes caught in the spiral of power she has handed over, terrified when the statue appears to respond to her bad as well as good wishes - not much of a story for a \u00a39.99 hardback.</p> <p>Denial is the unhealthy problem in Sharon Creech's <strong>The Wanderer</strong> (Macmillan \u00a34.99, pp240) as Sophie sails across the Atlantic with 'her family'. Through her diary and the diary of her cousin, we discover that Sophie has blocked her terrible past - dead parents, dead grandfather, fostering, confusion and drowning only revealed through her nightmares. </p> <p>I found no humour at all, except by accident. 'Today my father told me I'd been a good son and he'd been a bad father, and he was sorry about that. But he was wrong: I haven't been a good son.'</p> <p>Even though I didn't understand some of <strong>Milo's Wolves</strong> (Mammoth \u00a34.99, pp244), I loved it. The technology - computers, cloning, freezing of dead children - whirled past my understanding. However, Jenny Nimmo's balance between raw truth and familial cosiness provided the novel with the new reality requirements but softened with a fantastic emotive story. I realised the secret here - reality is fine, but only when interwoven with humour and a good plot.</p> <p>Perhaps our young teenagers will be less open to disappointment in later life. For without magic and mystery, happy families and fairyland, their expectations will be not be based on the imaginary perfection which was the launching pad we blasted off from.</p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000347970,00.html\">Buy Shylock's Daughter at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000476513,00.html\">Buy The Lady with Iron Bones at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000435066,00.html\">Buy The Wanderer at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000448074,00.html\">Buy Milo's Wolves at a discount at BOL</a></p>",

When I was older, he moulded me to have 'sparky' thoughts and when I wrote my first children's books, he tutored me on intertwining reality with creativity. Never too much information, allow young minds to smoulder with vision and ideas. But then the internet came along. Information became highly accessible, an awful lot of information. It was less acceptable to have subtlety and no longer is less more. Yet it seems the teenage novel is embracing this medium and has far greater appeal than the offerings of the Nineties. Teasing your reader is a tool of the past. Luckily, the pre-teens of the Nineties were fortunate enough to be weaned on C.S. Lewis, Anne Fine, Dahl and then J.K. Rowling, so at least they learnt slowly to scale reality with a knapsack full of imagination. The lowest ebb of children's novels (or books for young adults) was at the end of the twentieth century. Then the average sale of a hardback novel was about 800 copies; today, it is at least double that. Harry Potter was the catalyst for this and J.K. Rowling is by far the cleverest of our new authors, as she interprets real-life sagas and interweaves them with fantasy. The Harry Potter books take elements from C.S Lewis, E. Nesbit, Dahl and even Enid Blyton's Far Away Tree. Each of these authors overemphasise the injustices of our world through wildly imaginative fantasy. Are we are now witnessing the aftershock of the reality genre, the internet and other 'in your face' raw messages? It seems suspicious to me that Scholastic, Rowling's publishers in the US, reports that 40 per cent of its readers are adults and the majority of them are single. Philip Pullman's books are being followed by David Almond and Jacqueline Wills in seeming equally popular with adults, despite the claim that they are written for the less mature reader. So are these books really an accurate representation of what a teenage novel is or, indeed, what teenagers want? In the past few weeks, I have read four books which were written for 'young adults'. It 's been an exhausting process, with no escape. In Shylock's Daughter (Macmillan \u00a34.99, pp272), I felt discomfited by the clear message of Jewish victimisation by Christian society. Mirjam Pressler, the author, is shameless in her telling of Jessica's story from the ghettos to 'marrying out' into the Venetian nobility. This novel, though based on the Shakespeare play, presents the unhappy lot which befell Shylock's family at the hands of Antonio and Lorenzo's anti-Semitism. In the summing up by Brian Murdoch, the translator, the young reader is given little choice but to conclude that Jessica will reap only unhappiness through her Christian marriage: 'I did it of my own free will and I will have to take the consequences.' Family dysfunction and obsession overwhelmed me in Jan Mark's The Lady with Iron Bones (Walker Books \u00a39.99, pp159). The sadness of Casey's home life (her mother has postnatal depression, her father has left home, her brother has disappeared to find her father while her baby brother is allegedly 'backward') causes her to pray to a statue, the Lady with Iron Bones, which, in reality, is a birdbath in a neighbour's garden. Once her prayers are seem to be answered, she becomes obsessed, worshipping the statue and rewarding it with her few precious gifts. Ultimately, Casey becomes caught in the spiral of power she has handed over, terrified when the statue appears to respond to her bad as well as good wishes - not much of a story for a \u00a39.99 hardback. Denial is the unhealthy problem in Sharon Creech's The Wanderer (Macmillan \u00a34.99, pp240) as Sophie sails across the Atlantic with 'her family'. Through her diary and the diary of her cousin, we discover that Sophie has blocked her terrible past - dead parents, dead grandfather, fostering, confusion and drowning only revealed through her nightmares. I found no humour at all, except by accident. 'Today my father told me I'd been a good son and he'd been a bad father, and he was sorry about that. But he was wrong: I haven't been a good son.' Even though I didn't understand some of Milo's Wolves (Mammoth \u00a34.99, pp244), I loved it. The technology - computers, cloning, freezing of dead children - whirled past my understanding. However, Jenny Nimmo's balance between raw truth and familial cosiness provided the novel with the new reality requirements but softened with a fantastic emotive story. I realised the secret here - reality is fine, but only when interwoven with humour and a good plot. Perhaps our young teenagers will be less open to disappointment in later life. For without magic and mystery, happy families and fairyland, their expectations will be not be based on the imaginary perfection which was the launching pad we blasted off from.

And the book itself begins as if it too is going to be a referring back - the opening poem touches on the Troubles and Irish history, and ends with an image reclaimed from his first collection, Death of a Naturalist: 'The slime and silver of the fattened eel.' But this is no simple revisiting of old concerns. What is being set up here is the past, in all its evocativeness, and this is a past-haunted book if there ever was one. </p> <p>Inevitably, scenes from Heaney's earlier life feature largely. There are several childhood poems. This is nothing new, but here they are nudged towards the marvellous. 'Out of the Bag', for example, goes back to his origins, or what he, as a child, believed they were: </p> <p>All of us came in Doctor Kerlin's bag. </p> <p>Yes. That, or something like it, was what many of us were led to believe. But what makes this poem - and it's a poem that works superbly - is the adult writer staying true to the child's perspective, and allowing this to let him back into an imaginative world where the doctor's eyes were: </p> <p>Two peepholes to the locked room I saw into </p> <p>Every time his name was mentioned, skimmed </p> <p>Milk and ice, swabbed porcelain, the white</p> <p>And chill of tiles, steel hooks, chrome surgery tools </p> <p>And blood dreeps in the sawdust where it thickened </p> <p>At the foot of each cold wall.

Especially since being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1995, there is a weight of expectation on him that must be hard to cope with. His first collection after that, The Spirit Level (1996), would have been the pressure equivalent of a penalty shoot-out in the World Cup. He scored with aplomb, and the display here is arguably even more relaxed and confident. Again, there is the need at times to take on the big public subject. In this he wisely uses the personal as a launching pad.

Similarly, in another poem, waving Spanish peasants in the fields as he drives by remind him of the Irish Gaeltacht in the Fifties. It's as if there's a safety in connecting everything with what you know. But the flip side of that is that you also then admit what is theirs - so the Kosovo tragedy becomes yours. </p> <p>The Gaeltacht makes another appearance in a lovely, simple sonnet of that name, one written 'in imitation of Dante'.

And the book itself begins as if it too is going to be a referring back - the opening poem touches on the Troubles and Irish history, and ends with an image reclaimed from his first collection, Death of a Naturalist: 'The slime and silver of the fattened eel.' But this is no simple revisiting of old concerns. What is being set up here is the past, in all its evocativeness, and this is a past-haunted book if there ever was one. Inevitably, scenes from Heaney's earlier life feature largely. There are several childhood poems. This is nothing new, but here they are nudged towards the marvellous. 'Out of the Bag', for example, goes back to his origins, or what he, as a child, believed they were: All of us came in Doctor Kerlin's bag. Yes. That, or something like it, was what many of us were led to believe. But what makes this poem - and it's a poem that works superbly - is the adult writer staying true to the child's perspective, and allowing this to let him back into an imaginative world where the doctor's eyes were: Two peepholes to the locked room I saw into Every time his name was mentioned, skimmed Milk and ice, swabbed porcelain, the white And chill of tiles, steel hooks, chrome surgery tools And blood dreeps in the sawdust where it thickened At the foot of each cold wall.

Iambic tetrametric couplets, to be precise, although Bolt gives himself plenty of poetic licence with the form. The subtitle of the book - 'An adult fairytale for those/ Who've tired of fairytales in prose' - makes it sound like a rhythmic 'Reader's Wives' involving witch outfits and rubber toads, which isn't far from the truth. </p> <p>Lucy, a sweet young thing from the provinces, is fed up with her long-preserved virginity, and goes to live with her Great Aunt Alicia (hooked nose, pointy hat, broomstick) in London. The capital, she reasons, must be well stocked with potential cherry-pickers. Alicia lives in a Gothic manse just off Hampstead Heath, replete with gargoyles, barn-owls, nightjars, a sepulchral butler and a black cat. She has no issues with Lucy using her house as a base for her campaign: </p> <p>I give you leave - no, I 'demand' <br>That you secure your cherry's loss, <br>Shake off the stupid albatross <br>That's hanging round your nubile neck. </p> <p>Over the course of the novel our heroine tries out six beaux, but with each one something goes amiss at the eleventh hour. Richard, a middle-aged depressive, turns out to be an ex- of Great Aunt Alicia, who takes swift and belated revenge by turning him into a hare and releasing him onto Hampstead Heath. The egregiously erudite Algernon falls for Lucy when she plays a nimble tune on a virginal, but then misplaces his condoms at the crucial moment. Mungo, a Wildean dandy who wears a milk-white kimono of Kyoto silk, is wedded to art and bats for neither side.</p> <p>Then there are the three famous lovers. Alicia's magic broomstick allows Lucy to travel in time in her search for Mr Right. Dick Turpin, who turns out to be a jolly nice chap and not the ruffian that history has constructed him as, is the most considerate of Lucy's almost-lovers: </p> <p>Is it yer first time, wench?' he said, <br>'Ah, well, tis nothin' ye need dread'. </p> <p>But an excess of wine, consumed in the Spaniard's Inn, means Dick's dick won't stand and deliver. </p> <p>'Me cursed yard-arm, damn its eyes! <br>Damn the Madeira! Damn it all!\" </p> <p>Julius Caesar is stabbed by Brutus before he has time to veni-vidi-vici Lucy. By far the funniest of her clinches involves Casanova: </p> <p>He must be good; he's Casanova - <br>He's famed for it the whole world over </p> <p>He convinces Lucy to attempt The Scorpion With Two Backs, a fiendishly complicated sexual position from a Sanskrit treatise on the art of love. The pair end up locked in a concupiscent cat's-cradle of legs, arms and other things, and have to be lubricated apart by 12 pats of melted butter. </p> <p>The verse novel is a rare beast in today's publishing jungle. It is the Procrustean bed of narrative forms: novelistic qualities such as plot and character tend to get stretched or lopped to fit the demands of the poetic form. The most successful recent example is Vikram Seth's virtuosic The Golden Gate (1986), 690 tetrametric Shakespearean sonnets about Californian twentysomethings and their imaginatively named pets: a genuinely impressive feat of verbal dexterity. Losing It doesn't bear comparison, but then it doesn't have any particularly literary aspirations. </p> <p>It's just splendidly silly stuff, in which the gags are kept coming by the rhythm and rhyme (couplets being the correct form for a story about coupling). North Londoners will enjoy Bolt's transformation of Hampstead Heath into a Wuthering-Heightsesque stretch of moonlit wilderness, though his 'satiric' swipes at London life can be toe-curlingly ham-fisted: </p> <p>While the crowds passing to and fro <br>In almost a cloacal flow <br>Disgust one as they mill along, <br>With bad manners, and their pong. </p> <p>There's a discreet lack of anatomical detail, and asterisks act as fig-leafs for the very few naughty words. It's not quite the sort of book you'd let your children read, but not far off.

Constabularies got twice as big a rise each year under John Major. 'During John Major's government police spending underwent an average annual increase of 3.2 per cent,' said Christine Frayne, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. 'For the first four years of this Parliament, spending on the police increased every year by an average of 1.4 per cent.

The figures reveal the police budget would be almost \u00a3796 million greater if Labour had raised spending at the average rate Major did. The fight against crime was a key issue in the 1997 election, with Blair pledging to be 'tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime'. The findings - which take inflation into account - will outrage campaigners and police who have long protested at shrinking numbers of officers, poor recruitment levels and falling morale. Violent and urban crime rose last year, with assaults up 8 per cent, while police recruitment reached a seven-year low between April 1999 and March 2000. The study, based on figures revealed by Ministers last week, also shows that Scotland Yard's budget has been slashed this year by \u00a333m. Staffordshire Constabulary, where a 13 per cent rise in crime was recorded last year, has had its budget cut by \u00a32.1m. Cleveland and Cheshire constabularies have also had their budgets cut. In December, Sir John Stevens, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said the police service was 'moving towards the edge of crisis'.

A Labour Party spokesman said that funding was 'purely a departmental matter' and declined to comment. Last week, the Metropolitan Police came under severe criticism from an audit of their finances by accountants KPMG which concluded that tens of millions of pounds were wasted every year through poor management. nick.walsh@observer.co.uk",

Hill was involved in a series of high-profile spats between the party and the BBC in the run-up to the 1997 election. He regularly rowed with the editors of BBC Radio 4's the Today programme and the World at One. One official said Hill would be checking the BBC 'with a stop-watch' to ensure Labour policies received fair coverage.' Senior BBC figures said they 'were ready for a fight'. 'What they [the Labour Party] don't seem to understand is that the more they complain the more we realise we are doing a good job,' said one editor. 'Trying to bully us into covering politics the way they want will not work. The public will see them for what they really are.' Last week Downing Street directly criticised the BBC over the prominent coverage it gave a newspaper story saying that Alastair Campbell, the Prime Minister's official spokesman, was to take a 'behind-the-scenes' role after the election. 'It's typical of the media obsession with process and personality, rather than the serious issues facing the country, that a newspaper article about Alastair Campbell should feature on the BBC TV news ahead of an important speech by the Prime Minister about the future of our country's schools,' a Downing Street spokesman said.",

      "byline": "Lesley Gillilan",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Almost 50 years after the Festival of Britain, I make a pilgrimage to its erstwhile epicentre, the Thames embankment site of the South Bank Exhibition. It doesn't take long. Other than pacing the length of the site, between Waterloo Bridge and the old County Hall, all it entails is a disappointing inspection of the vacant ground now known as Jubilee Gardens.</p> <p> It's a struggle to equate this scruffy patch of grass with the post-war pageant that saw 8m people tramping in and out of gaudy show pavilions, under garlands of patriotic bunting, twinkling lights and fountains fizzing with gas flames. Armed with an original Festival map, it's still impossible to place the ghosts of the Skylon (slender, luminous rocket of steel and aluminium) or the Dome of Discovery (flying-saucer lookalike, four times the size of the Albert Hall). </p> <p>The spaces once devoted to a maze of themed Festival pavilions (Sea and Ships, Homes and Gardens, Power and Production, etc) are now buried beneath the soulless concrete towers of the Shell Centre. The Festival's Fairway, once a fairy-lit piazza, has been swallowed by the Hungerford carpark. Even the Royal Festival Hall, the only exhibition structure to survive intact, has been subjugated by a ring of brutalist concrete wrapped like a motorway flyover around its lower regions. All other evidence of the state-run arts fest, which Dylan Thomas described as 'a palace in thunderland, sizzling with scientific witches' brews', has been erased without so much as a commemorative plaque. </p> <p>So was the South Bank Exhibition just a giant garden f\u00eate? Not if you talk to the generations of designers whose work is still inspired by it. Indeed, in the prologue to A Tonic to the Nation (a collection of essays published in 1976 to mark its 25th anniversary), Sir Roy Strong, former director of the V&amp;A, went as far as to say that the Festival of Britain was 'the last really great stylistic statement this country made'.</p> <p>The Festival could also be said to be the pinnacle of Old Labour achievement: a tonic to the nation, expressed in welfare-state architecture, public art and enterprise and free of commercial sponsorship. There would, perhaps, be an irony here, had Tony Blair decided to call an election on 3 May - the day was the Festival's official opening, exactly 50 years ago. But although the Festival of Britain is often remembered as an apotheosis of dreary authoritarian socialism, it was truly popular; and it certainly looks much more fun than the late, unlamented Millennium Dome.</p> <p>First mooted by the Royal Society of Arts in 1943, the Festival of Britain was originally intended to commemorate the centenary of the first world fair - the Great Exhibition of 1851. By the time Clement Attlee's newly elected Labour government appointed Home Secretary Herbert Morrison (Peter Mandelson's grandfather) as Lord President of a Festival Cabinet in 1947, the emphasis had shifted away from international trade to a British celebration of identity and national industry. It was, as Morrison said, a 'madness... but the sort of madness that would put Britain on the map'.</p> <p>In his role as Lord Festival, he appointed a council of eminent advisors (including TS Eliot and John Gielgud); he made Gerald Barry (former editor of the News Chronicle ) his director general; and Hugh Casson his architectural director. And together with armies of artists, designers and 'theme convenors', their task was to transform 27 acres of what Casson described as 'a grimy and battered film set of a place' into a place of 'gaiety, colour and enchantment' in just 22 months.</p> <p>Like the Dome, it was lambasted by the press as a profligate waste of money (\u00a311m in all). And Morrison's struggle to justify frivolous public expenditure, at a time of meat rationing, petrol shortages and the Korean war, now looks much more tricky than his grandson's. The administration was also beset by Dome-like problems (resignations, strikes, wet weather). But, in the end, its lighthearted tone and innovative democratic design won the hearts of the public.</p> <p>'It was a marvellous uplifting experience,' remembers photographer Jane Bown, who documented the event for The Observer. 'We were young, the war was over, and there we were, full of hope, dancing on the South Bank. The breathtaking shapes and colours evoked a wonderful feeling of freedom.'</p> <p>The main attractions were the Dome of Discovery - a huge inverted saucer of aluminium, designed by 39-year-old Ralph Tubbs, featuring a planetarium (reached by an 'Escalator to Outer Space'), a Polar Theatre (complete with huskies) and a life-sized repro of Captain Cook's Endeavour. There was the 300ft Skylon, the result of an architectural competition for a 'vertical feature', won by architects Powell and Moya; a television pavilion designed by Wells Coates (including a 'Telecinema' in which audiences wore goggles to watch new-fangled stereoscopic films).</p> <p>The communal spaces, laid out as a miniature city, were decorated with sculptures by Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, Lynn Chadwick and others. In the Homes and Gardens pavilion, Robin Day experimented with ideas on the theme of 'home entertainment'. In the Minerals Pavilion, there was a simulated coal mine. In the Countryside Pavilion, a variety of tractors whooshed up and down on hydraulic columns. A herd of Jersey cows attended the opening. </p> <p>And if you think this sounds like a heaven of kitsch, then you wouldn't have been able to resist taking a shuttle boat from one of the two piers, either side of the Hungerford Bridge, to 'lovely Battersea Park'. Here, were the Festival pleasure gardens - Alice in Wonderland meets Eurotrash - complete with Water-Splash ride, the Oyster Creek and Far Tottering railway, a hideous pneumatic giant and a wedding-cake of a caf\u00e9 designed by Patrick Gwynne. </p> <p>The food, everyone recalls, was awful. But then there was no decent food; one of the adverts in the souvenir programme was for canned processed peas ('Oh! how tender, how delicious; sweet and plump and so nutritious'). But the restaurants were visual feasts. Not least the iconographic Regatta Restaurant designed by Misha Black, which featured murals by Ben Nicholson and 'a novel system of decorative pattern... derived from the diagrams made when scientists map the arrangements of atoms in crystals studied by X-ray methods'. </p> <p>This injection of colourful crystallography, cybernetics, aeronautics and moon-gazing optimism into Britain's drab, bomb-shattered landscape was what really captured the imagination. People complained, of course; about the queues, the shabby British tourists, the rubbish floating in the Thames, even the smell of the huskies. 'It was all bread, circuses and socialism,' remembers one disenchanted visitor.

      "bodyText": "Almost 50 years after the Festival of Britain, I make a pilgrimage to its erstwhile epicentre, the Thames embankment site of the South Bank Exhibition. It doesn't take long. Other than pacing the length of the site, between Waterloo Bridge and the old County Hall, all it entails is a disappointing inspection of the vacant ground now known as Jubilee Gardens. It's a struggle to equate this scruffy patch of grass with the post-war pageant that saw 8m people tramping in and out of gaudy show pavilions, under garlands of patriotic bunting, twinkling lights and fountains fizzing with gas flames. Armed with an original Festival map, it's still impossible to place the ghosts of the Skylon (slender, luminous rocket of steel and aluminium) or the Dome of Discovery (flying-saucer lookalike, four times the size of the Albert Hall). The spaces once devoted to a maze of themed Festival pavilions (Sea and Ships, Homes and Gardens, Power and Production, etc) are now buried beneath the soulless concrete towers of the Shell Centre. The Festival's Fairway, once a fairy-lit piazza, has been swallowed by the Hungerford carpark. Even the Royal Festival Hall, the only exhibition structure to survive intact, has been subjugated by a ring of brutalist concrete wrapped like a motorway flyover around its lower regions. All other evidence of the state-run arts fest, which Dylan Thomas described as 'a palace in thunderland, sizzling with scientific witches' brews', has been erased without so much as a commemorative plaque. So was the South Bank Exhibition just a giant garden f\u00eate? Not if you talk to the generations of designers whose work is still inspired by it. Indeed, in the prologue to A Tonic to the Nation (a collection of essays published in 1976 to mark its 25th anniversary), Sir Roy Strong, former director of the V&amp;A, went as far as to say that the Festival of Britain was 'the last really great stylistic statement this country made'. The Festival could also be said to be the pinnacle of Old Labour achievement: a tonic to the nation, expressed in welfare-state architecture, public art and enterprise and free of commercial sponsorship. There would, perhaps, be an irony here, had Tony Blair decided to call an election on 3 May - the day was the Festival's official opening, exactly 50 years ago. But although the Festival of Britain is often remembered as an apotheosis of dreary authoritarian socialism, it was truly popular; and it certainly looks much more fun than the late, unlamented Millennium Dome. First mooted by the Royal Society of Arts in 1943, the Festival of Britain was originally intended to commemorate the centenary of the first world fair - the Great Exhibition of 1851. By the time Clement Attlee's newly elected Labour government appointed Home Secretary Herbert Morrison (Peter Mandelson's grandfather) as Lord President of a Festival Cabinet in 1947, the emphasis had shifted away from international trade to a British celebration of identity and national industry. It was, as Morrison said, a 'madness... but the sort of madness that would put Britain on the map'. In his role as Lord Festival, he appointed a council of eminent advisors (including TS Eliot and John Gielgud); he made Gerald Barry (former editor of the News Chronicle ) his director general; and Hugh Casson his architectural director. And together with armies of artists, designers and 'theme convenors', their task was to transform 27 acres of what Casson described as 'a grimy and battered film set of a place' into a place of 'gaiety, colour and enchantment' in just 22 months. Like the Dome, it was lambasted by the press as a profligate waste of money (\u00a311m in all). And Morrison's struggle to justify frivolous public expenditure, at a time of meat rationing, petrol shortages and the Korean war, now looks much more tricky than his grandson's. The administration was also beset by Dome-like problems (resignations, strikes, wet weather). But, in the end, its lighthearted tone and innovative democratic design won the hearts of the public. 'It was a marvellous uplifting experience,' remembers photographer Jane Bown, who documented the event for The Observer. 'We were young, the war was over, and there we were, full of hope, dancing on the South Bank. The breathtaking shapes and colours evoked a wonderful feeling of freedom.' The main attractions were the Dome of Discovery - a huge inverted saucer of aluminium, designed by 39-year-old Ralph Tubbs, featuring a planetarium (reached by an 'Escalator to Outer Space'), a Polar Theatre (complete with huskies) and a life-sized repro of Captain Cook's Endeavour. There was the 300ft Skylon, the result of an architectural competition for a 'vertical feature', won by architects Powell and Moya; a television pavilion designed by Wells Coates (including a 'Telecinema' in which audiences wore goggles to watch new-fangled stereoscopic films). The communal spaces, laid out as a miniature city, were decorated with sculptures by Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, Lynn Chadwick and others. In the Homes and Gardens pavilion, Robin Day experimented with ideas on the theme of 'home entertainment'. In the Minerals Pavilion, there was a simulated coal mine. In the Countryside Pavilion, a variety of tractors whooshed up and down on hydraulic columns. A herd of Jersey cows attended the opening. And if you think this sounds like a heaven of kitsch, then you wouldn't have been able to resist taking a shuttle boat from one of the two piers, either side of the Hungerford Bridge, to 'lovely Battersea Park'. Here, were the Festival pleasure gardens - Alice in Wonderland meets Eurotrash - complete with Water-Splash ride, the Oyster Creek and Far Tottering railway, a hideous pneumatic giant and a wedding-cake of a caf\u00e9 designed by Patrick Gwynne. The food, everyone recalls, was awful. But then there was no decent food; one of the adverts in the souvenir programme was for canned processed peas ('Oh! how tender, how delicious; sweet and plump and so nutritious'). But the restaurants were visual feasts. Not least the iconographic Regatta Restaurant designed by Misha Black, which featured murals by Ben Nicholson and 'a novel system of decorative pattern... derived from the diagrams made when scientists map the arrangements of atoms in crystals studied by X-ray methods'. This injection of colourful crystallography, cybernetics, aeronautics and moon-gazing optimism into Britain's drab, bomb-shattered landscape was what really captured the imagination. People complained, of course; about the queues, the shabby British tourists, the rubbish floating in the Thames, even the smell of the huskies. 'It was all bread, circuses and socialism,' remembers one disenchanted visitor. But even the most cynical factions of the press were forced to admit that the Festival of Britain was a success. After five months, and an estimated 250 miles of sucked Festival rock, the South Bank Exhibition closed, as was always intended, in September 1951. A general election followed in October. And in what now seems a churlish act of vandalism, Winston Churchill's succeeding Conservative government removed all trace of the exhibition pavilions.

Disaffection, he argues, is symptomatic of old-school architects trying to keep in with the young.

      "body": "<p>Thora Birch and her mother arrive together as a kind of package, though I am not supposed to write about the mother, Carol, a middle-aged woman with long hair and a face free of the maquillage that usually camouflages the skins of the Beverly Hills animal kingdom. 'Please don't write about me,' says Carol. 'I always talk too much.' She is still angry about an article written about her daughter which suggested that the 19-year-old, whose parents manage her career, was not being allowed to break free of them. 'I could kill that writer,' says Carol vehemently. 'I really could.' </p> <p>They do have a problem, the Birches. Jack and Carol. The shadow of Macaulay Culkin rests uneasily and the showbiz parent attracts bad press in a town where embarrassing mothers hog borrowed spotlight and spew inanities at the gawpers and stalkers. </p> <p>The history of Hollywood relates that it is more sensible for an actress to employ her father than her husband. One cannot imagine that it is easy doing business with a person who is also the actress's father, but the trajectory of many a career would be very different if the woman had employed a person as concerned with her personal welfare as with her ability to make money. </p> <p>The Birches are keen to keep a low profile, and Carol points out that she is not a stage mother - 'I hate that accusation!' She was not the one who noticed Birch's potential. A babysitter took her, aged four, to an audition for a commercial. 'It was like a fish to water,' Carol says. </p> <p>The little girl was a success right away, appearing in television advertisements for California Raisins and Quaker Oats. At the age of six, she won an award for her appearance in Purple People Eater. By her third film, All I Want for Christmas, in 1991, she was being compared to Shirley Temple and giving interviews of uncanny self-possession. </p> <p>The Evening Standard 's Angus McGill, finding her in a suite at the London Athenaeum Hotel, could not believe his eyes. 'How old are you?' He asked. 'Nine,' she replied. 'How old are you?' Birch was in town to work on Patriot Games, in which she played Harrison Ford's daughter. McGill asked her if she liked the business. 'Like it?' She exclaimed. 'I love it. My father said I could give it up any time. It was up to me. I didn't have to go to auditions if I didn't want to. I told him no, I want to stay in the business - and here I am. It's amazing.' Then she asked him if he thought God was a man or a girl. </p> <p>Self-possessed she was then, and self-possessed she is now. One cannot imagine anyone being able to bully Birch, now 19, for she is intelligent and determined and seems to know exactly what she is doing. She reads all the scripts that are sent to her and, while knowing what she likes, finds it more difficult to articulate why she does not like something. 'It would sound pretentious and nasty so I won't vocalise it.' Her parents tend to agree with her on things, though not always on 'how to handle them'. </p> <p>We are in Le Conversation on Doheny Drive, on the outskirts of Beverly Hills. She has chosen it because it is near the West Hollywood apartment which also doubles as her office, and because it is funny. She is right. It is funny, a 'caf\u00e9 society' tea salon with striped wallpaper, pier gilt mirrors, faux-marble floor, several youngish directors eating scones, and a huge oil painting of two rabbits. Understated in jeans and jersey, Birch has a flawless complexion supervised by her mother, who has just discovered products made by Dr Hauschka. </p> <p>She has talent, as was apparent to anyone who saw the Oscar-winning American Beauty, in which she played troubled teenager Jane Burnham. She was one of the first to audition for the part. 'I knew the script was good,' she says. 'And I knew the process would be amazing - how could working with Kevin Spacey not be brilliant? - but I didn't know what people would think of it, and I still don't really know if the audience actually liked it. I mean, they all saw it because it made a lot of money - I think they recognised it as being a brilliant film - but I don't think they were very comfortable with it.' </p> <p>The success of American Beauty opened doors and she proceeded to corner a niche in nubile young women. The Smokers is about three teenage girls who rape their boyfriends at gunpoint; Ghost World saw her as Enid, a geeky outsider in thick-framed specs and Doc Martens. Dungeons and Dragons , a fantasy adventure, provided a departure. As heroic Empress Savina, she is involved in a difficult struggle with Jeremy Irons who, as the Mage Profion, employs various elves to help him take over the Empire of Izmer. </p> <p>Now she has made The Hole, a sinister British thriller set in an upmarket boarding school (Downside was used as a location), which tells the story of a group of teenagers for whom a practical joke goes very badly wrong. As Liz, she plays a complex person summed up in the synopsis as a 'damaged and dangerous mind'. </p> <p>She wears it well, the duplicitous psycho. Sometimes sweet and innocent, sometimes deranged with maniacal obsession, she provides the story with the layers required to give it depth and deflect the usual clich\u00e9s of horror. It is a good movie, genuinely unnerving, and filmed imaginatively by first-time director Nick Hamm. It is also reflective of a dark cultural truth where, to a lot of schoolchildren, particularly in America, the high school has become a genuinely dangerous place to be. </p> <p>Birch shrugs at 'damaged and dangerous'. It was hard work, she says. There was a lot of crying. She has never felt an emotional pain like that before in her life. But she is good at tapping into her hidden fury. 'Liz was about five different characters,' she says. 'She is totally sick, yes, but it was about love...' </p> <p>She hopes people will see the character's point of view; it was a difficult role to shrug off, and she feels protective of her, as actors often do with the characters they have created. It is about obsession and, in particular obsessive love, a dark place experienced by many that can drive an individual to ruin. She understands that, has felt it, and thinks that once you have felt it, it effects your life and never entirely leaves you. </p> <p>Is there a boyfriend, I wonder. 'I'm in between at the moment,' she says. She is used to the press, so she probably would not tell anyway, if she did not want to. </p> <p>She lives at home with her parents and younger brother on their ranch in the Californian desert. She doesn't spend much, drives a 1998 Mustang, buys the occasional CD by Radiohead, the occasional book by Tom Wolfe, watches a lot of DVDs. Gary Oldman is a hero and she is desperate to work with Anthony Hopkins because he doesn't seem to, 'give a damn' about all that Hollywood stuff. She would be more excited by the idea of meeting Moby than some big-name actor. She has met most of them, after all, and worked with a lot of them. The only question she really wants to ask is: 'Have you got any good scripts for me?' </p> <p>She went to school in West Hollywood where there are not many children, as it is a gay community, so pupils were 'bussed in ' from east LA. Older brothers were armed; younger ones would talk about joining gangs. Birch thought they were insane. She was usually off doing a commercial, anyway. </p> <p>Her parents were involved in the music business; her father was a road manager and toured with struggling rock bands before going into property and making money from selling land. They had a sophisticated sound system that piped music through the house. Birch grew up listening to Lenny Bruce. 'Part of me would like to be Lenny Bruce for some reason. I would love to hear what he would say about Eminem and Clinton now.' </p> <p>Pink Floyd also echoed through the family ranch. 'You listen to Dark Side of the Moon and you might think it is boring at first, then, after several times, it's like Oh my God, the genius of it. That is very English, I think.' </p> <p>She likes the English and feels comfortable with them, unlike in Los Angeles, where she does not really feel a part of things. She enjoyed London from a tourist's eye - appreciating things like Sock Shop and Hyde Park and the pubs. </p> <p>She visited Benenden, the girls' public school, to research her part for The Hole, and was surprised to discover how much they cared about what adults thought. 'I spent the night in a dorm. We had a midnight feast and everything. But even the kids who think they are really bad couldn't last five minutes on one of our urban streets...' </p> <p>Nick Hamm's own experience, at a boarding school in Belfast, had not been enjoyable - though he insists his film is not an act of revenge. He thinks the British public-school system leaves a lot to be desired and was keen to reflect its dark side by keeping the film based in England and very British in its tone. To this end he tried, and failed, to find a British actress. After six months, he took the search to Hollywood. He wanted the film to be about teenagers and for the actors to be the right age - 20 would have been too old. A lot of actresses read for the part of Liz, but Birch, according to Hamm, 'had the Bette Davis quality of being able to lie and tell the truth at the same time'. </p> <p>Young people, says Hamm, are capable of 'huge surliness one minute and massive love the next'. He made sure that all this was channelled into the work; everyone went to bed early. There was no time for emotional explosions. </p> <p>To Birch, I repeat Hamm's observation that 'teenagers look down on all adults because adults don't understand them... and never will'. </p> <p>'Most teens think that adults don't understand them,' she replies. 'And I think a lot of adults tell themselves they don't understand teens. But that is not true. All they have to do is remember being one, but the reason they don't is that it is an awful time and who wants to remember it? </p> <p>'A lot of parents have this tendency to treat their kids like they're not people. It is not a malicious thing, it is more that this is my child and it is not really a person, it is a \"beautiful alien\" - a precious gift that cannot be treated like anything else on the planet - so everything gets muddled up.' </p> <p>Her two most high-profile projects have seen her as short brunette playing against a tall blonde - Mena Suvari - in American Beauty, Keira Knightley in The Hole. I wonder if she has ever been aggrieved by the high-school diktat that says all teenagers must be thin and look like Hitler Youth in order to be popular. </p> <p>'Everyone thinks that,' she says. 'But I think that it is the personality that is important. If you are gorgeous you are going to get attention - but it is about attitude. If there is fear you invoke fear, if you are a party person you are invited to parties. It is about your personal energy. Do you have an outgoing energy or the kind of energy that makes people want to hit you? Most people have a normal energy which means that no one pays them attention - then they say they are not popular because they do not have this or that, but, in fact it is because they are not opening up.' </p> <p>'Jesus,' I say. 'I wish I had known all that when I was 18.'</p> <p>\u0095 The Hole goes on general release on 20 April.</p>",

It was quite romantic. </p> <p>The great disappointment after the Festival finished was that we thought our lives were made, only to find there was no work.

You begin to see the effects of the Festival of Britain in the early 60s when I opened Habitat.

It was a grey and damaged land and it was a challenge to buy simple things like screws. You would want to make cushions for something, but you couldn't find any textiles, so I'd spend my time going down to Petticoat Lane where you'd find some that had fallen off the back of a lorry. In a sense you would design for the materials you could get your hands on. But when we went back a few months later, we thought it had been terrifically worthwhile, because you actually saw the reaction of ordinary people. They were still carrying their sandwiches in their gas-mask cases and wearing long raincoats, but the Festival showed them a different sort of world. You could see it on their faces. It was quite romantic. The great disappointment after the Festival finished was that we thought our lives were made, only to find there was no work. It had offered the nation something different and they were amazed and excited. So I knew there was a dormant audience for the kind of design I believed in. But it wasn't until the end of the 50s that the economy expanded sufficiently and young people had money to spend. You begin to see the effects of the Festival of Britain in the early 60s when I opened Habitat. Young people were offered things they hadn't seen before and they were able to indulge in something different from their parents. I'm sure the Festival was the beginning of a great revolution in this country where we are perceived as the most creative nation in the world. We're thought of as the great happening place in the world, and the Festival of Britain lit that touchpaper.",

      "body": "<p>Lucie Smailes sometimes has trouble finding a babysitter. Her two young children, Billy and Lily, are not the problem, she explains; it's the wall-to-wall 50s decor. Some of her mates simply can't stomach another evening on her authentic post-war sofa, leaning against poodle-stitched antimacassars, surrounded by green-tinted Tretchikoff babes and crowds of small plastic se\u00f1oritas doing the Fandango across coloured Formica. </p> <p>The house is an ordinary two-up-two-down in suburban Bristol, except that its interior appears to have got lost in time somewhere around 1955. The look is post-modern retro, but more at the Woolworths end of the style spectrum (think Only Fools and Horses meets The Simpsons ). The basic colour palette is custard, bubblegum and candy floss. Kitchen furnishings include a yellow dinette table and matching metal-leg chairs; one of those tallboy (or Del Boy) cabinets with a fold-down work surface; and a original retro fridge (in spray-on lipstick pink). </p> <p>Accessories include a canoe-shaped dish of fake fruit, a carousel of frilly cotton pinnies, coloured pegs, pink flamingos, Festival of Britain wire ware (with knobs on) and illuminated posies of Lucie's favourite plastic roses ('I love roses,' she says). She also loves leopard print, red Perspex and diaphanous vinyl. She wears them when she gets a chance (a wardrobe of ruched swimming costumes, frothy frocks, hats and handbags, is displayed on her bedroom wall). Lucie's idea of a snack? A handful of jelly beans dispensed from a slot machine ('It only takes French francs'), served on red-and-white spotted picnic ware. </p> <p>In her front room, there's a ship-shaped cocktail cabinet clad in wood-look Fablon and a glitzy mirror-glass cupboard stuffed with plastic-flower paperweights. There's a plastic budgie in a chrome cage, a shiny red-vinyl settee, festoons of paper lanterns and light-up tropical birds, but no television, no stereo - just a mind-bending display of 50s kitsch. </p> <p>'To my mother's generation, it's all tacky, working-class crap,' says Lucie. And even to us 50s-friendly baby boomers, it evokes mixed feelings, ranging from a vague, uncomfortable sense of familiarity to plain distaste. 'Most of my friends don't like all my 50s stuff,' says Lucie. 'They think I should clear it all out and make the place more homely for the children.' And she has tried to give it up. But therein lies a problem: she can't live without it. 'To me, it's a form of antidepressant - it makes me smile.' </p> <p>In a sense, her sentiments reflect the mood of the time in which her 'stuff' was born - when cheap, cheerful chain-store goods, big hair, big frocks and imported Americanisms provided an antidote to years of war-time gloom. Imagine the joy of escaping dreary Utility plywood for chrome and vivid Formica, swapping khaki serge for brushed Bri-Nylon, or replacing blackout curtains with the window-wear equivalent of Hawaiian shirts. </p> <p>The years that followed the Festival of Britain saw the birth of Terylene, tea bags and TV dinners, the first jet-airline service, the Pill, the Pop Parade, molecules, microchips, Miss World and the Chevrolet Corvette. Yet at the beginning of the decade, nearly half of British homes had no bathroom or indoor lavatory. The whimsical mass-market consumer goods of the time suggested cocktail hours and exotic package holidays, but for most people, it was all scrubbing brushes, boiled cabbage and Spam. </p> <p>'My interpretation of the 50s is a fantasy,' admits Lucie, who wasn't born until 1968. 'In my 50s, everyone had bright melamine kitchens and new-fangled gadgets, and went to rock'n'roll concerts every night, but I know it wasn't really like that. In fact, I'd hate to have been a 50s housewife. Life was still very hard. It wasn't until 1959 to 1960 that things started to pick up.' And nobody, working class or otherwise, would have had quite the concentration of frivolous knick-knacks that have been squeezed into Lucie's house. Her collection must have come from literally hundreds of households (and that's just the Spanish dolls). </p> <p>Her habit started with a Pat Boone record case, circa 1955, bought at a jumble sale 10 years ago. 'When I first started collecting, I wasn't aware I was buying 50s things - I just liked what I saw and bought it.' Throughout her twenties (as London Contemporary dancer, Citro\u00ebn 2CV mechanic and tequila slammer girl), Lucie continued to buy, but it only became an obsession when she was studying interior design at art college. 'I did a project on Molecular 50s and Festival of Britain furnishings, and I got completely hooked,' she says. </p> <p>She succumbs to the occasional extravagance, such as the pink retro fridge at \u00a3250 ('It was worth it, especially when you think of the price of a Smeg'), but the challenge is in finding things at a bargain price. Most of Lucie's treasures were bought at jumble sales and car boots. </p> <p>Favourites include a Hula-girl table fountain which sprinkles water into a small, lurid-green pond of plastic lilies; a cylindrical, red Perspex cocktail cabinet with matching red-rose lampshade; plus Lucie's collection of 'Tinas', or framed glamour-girl prints by Siberian-born Vladimir Tretchikoff, JH Lynch and other masters of low-brow populist art. Tretchikoff's The Green Lady , painted in 1952, was the most reproduced work of the 20th century. It is now achieving status as an icon of post-modern irony, but Lucie doesn't see her like that. </p> <p>'I don't care about dates, origins or how much anything is worth; my choices are purely aesthetic,' she says. But she has, nonetheless, picked up some 'classic' pieces of collectable kitsch. A spike- legged coffee table featuring a scene from Swan Lake , for example, is a relic of the 'Balletomania' era, when Margot Fonteyn was the teen-heroine equivalent of Posh Spice. The boat-shaped cocktail bar is not particularly rare (factory-made in the early 50s by Barget), but Lucie's is in pristine condition and includes a porthole, anchor and fake-wood laminate deck. </p> <p>She has a small collection of Homemaker - Ridgway Potteries' tableware, designed by Enid Seeney for Woolworths (in which an abstraction of Robin Day-esque chairs and boomerang tables float around in monochrome space). She has at least two Miss Tissue Heads (plastic dolls' heads from which Kleenex is dispensed from a mane of pink-nylon hair), and dozens of examples of wire-ware products (zigzag wall tidies, magazine racks, plant holders) with the classic Festival of Britain-style 'cocktail cherry' feet. </p> <p>According to Collecting the 1950s (\u00a315.99, Mitchell Beazley), a Miller's Collectable Price Guide, many of these things now fetch reasonable prices (Tretchikoff print about \u00a330; Barget bar, \u00a3150; American dinette table, \u00a3750). In fact, Lucie often sells pieces she's grown tired of or can't fit into her house - though she still has a wish list of things she would always find room for. 'I've always wanted a Miss Mixer Martini shaker,' she says. 'She wobbles her boobs around while shaking the drink.' Sounds ghastly?

      "bodyText": "Lucie Smailes sometimes has trouble finding a babysitter. Her two young children, Billy and Lily, are not the problem, she explains; it's the wall-to-wall 50s decor. Some of her mates simply can't stomach another evening on her authentic post-war sofa, leaning against poodle-stitched antimacassars, surrounded by green-tinted Tretchikoff babes and crowds of small plastic se\u00f1oritas doing the Fandango across coloured Formica. The house is an ordinary two-up-two-down in suburban Bristol, except that its interior appears to have got lost in time somewhere around 1955. The look is post-modern retro, but more at the Woolworths end of the style spectrum (think Only Fools and Horses meets The Simpsons ). The basic colour palette is custard, bubblegum and candy floss. Kitchen furnishings include a yellow dinette table and matching metal-leg chairs; one of those tallboy (or Del Boy) cabinets with a fold-down work surface; and a original retro fridge (in spray-on lipstick pink). Accessories include a canoe-shaped dish of fake fruit, a carousel of frilly cotton pinnies, coloured pegs, pink flamingos, Festival of Britain wire ware (with knobs on) and illuminated posies of Lucie's favourite plastic roses ('I love roses,' she says). She also loves leopard print, red Perspex and diaphanous vinyl. She wears them when she gets a chance (a wardrobe of ruched swimming costumes, frothy frocks, hats and handbags, is displayed on her bedroom wall). Lucie's idea of a snack? A handful of jelly beans dispensed from a slot machine ('It only takes French francs'), served on red-and-white spotted picnic ware. In her front room, there's a ship-shaped cocktail cabinet clad in wood-look Fablon and a glitzy mirror-glass cupboard stuffed with plastic-flower paperweights. There's a plastic budgie in a chrome cage, a shiny red-vinyl settee, festoons of paper lanterns and light-up tropical birds, but no television, no stereo - just a mind-bending display of 50s kitsch. 'To my mother's generation, it's all tacky, working-class crap,' says Lucie. And even to us 50s-friendly baby boomers, it evokes mixed feelings, ranging from a vague, uncomfortable sense of familiarity to plain distaste. 'Most of my friends don't like all my 50s stuff,' says Lucie. 'They think I should clear it all out and make the place more homely for the children.' And she has tried to give it up. But therein lies a problem: she can't live without it. 'To me, it's a form of antidepressant - it makes me smile.' In a sense, her sentiments reflect the mood of the time in which her 'stuff' was born - when cheap, cheerful chain-store goods, big hair, big frocks and imported Americanisms provided an antidote to years of war-time gloom. Imagine the joy of escaping dreary Utility plywood for chrome and vivid Formica, swapping khaki serge for brushed Bri-Nylon, or replacing blackout curtains with the window-wear equivalent of Hawaiian shirts. The years that followed the Festival of Britain saw the birth of Terylene, tea bags and TV dinners, the first jet-airline service, the Pill, the Pop Parade, molecules, microchips, Miss World and the Chevrolet Corvette. Yet at the beginning of the decade, nearly half of British homes had no bathroom or indoor lavatory. The whimsical mass-market consumer goods of the time suggested cocktail hours and exotic package holidays, but for most people, it was all scrubbing brushes, boiled cabbage and Spam. 'My interpretation of the 50s is a fantasy,' admits Lucie, who wasn't born until 1968. 'In my 50s, everyone had bright melamine kitchens and new-fangled gadgets, and went to rock'n'roll concerts every night, but I know it wasn't really like that. In fact, I'd hate to have been a 50s housewife. Life was still very hard. It wasn't until 1959 to 1960 that things started to pick up.' And nobody, working class or otherwise, would have had quite the concentration of frivolous knick-knacks that have been squeezed into Lucie's house. Her collection must have come from literally hundreds of households (and that's just the Spanish dolls). Her habit started with a Pat Boone record case, circa 1955, bought at a jumble sale 10 years ago. 'When I first started collecting, I wasn't aware I was buying 50s things - I just liked what I saw and bought it.' Throughout her twenties (as London Contemporary dancer, Citro\u00ebn 2CV mechanic and tequila slammer girl), Lucie continued to buy, but it only became an obsession when she was studying interior design at art college. 'I did a project on Molecular 50s and Festival of Britain furnishings, and I got completely hooked,' she says. She succumbs to the occasional extravagance, such as the pink retro fridge at \u00a3250 ('It was worth it, especially when you think of the price of a Smeg'), but the challenge is in finding things at a bargain price. Most of Lucie's treasures were bought at jumble sales and car boots. Favourites include a Hula-girl table fountain which sprinkles water into a small, lurid-green pond of plastic lilies; a cylindrical, red Perspex cocktail cabinet with matching red-rose lampshade; plus Lucie's collection of 'Tinas', or framed glamour-girl prints by Siberian-born Vladimir Tretchikoff, JH Lynch and other masters of low-brow populist art. Tretchikoff's The Green Lady , painted in 1952, was the most reproduced work of the 20th century. It is now achieving status as an icon of post-modern irony, but Lucie doesn't see her like that. 'I don't care about dates, origins or how much anything is worth; my choices are purely aesthetic,' she says. But she has, nonetheless, picked up some 'classic' pieces of collectable kitsch. A spike- legged coffee table featuring a scene from Swan Lake , for example, is a relic of the 'Balletomania' era, when Margot Fonteyn was the teen-heroine equivalent of Posh Spice. The boat-shaped cocktail bar is not particularly rare (factory-made in the early 50s by Barget), but Lucie's is in pristine condition and includes a porthole, anchor and fake-wood laminate deck. She has a small collection of Homemaker - Ridgway Potteries' tableware, designed by Enid Seeney for Woolworths (in which an abstraction of Robin Day-esque chairs and boomerang tables float around in monochrome space). She has at least two Miss Tissue Heads (plastic dolls' heads from which Kleenex is dispensed from a mane of pink-nylon hair), and dozens of examples of wire-ware products (zigzag wall tidies, magazine racks, plant holders) with the classic Festival of Britain-style 'cocktail cherry' feet. According to Collecting the 1950s (\u00a315.99, Mitchell Beazley), a Miller's Collectable Price Guide, many of these things now fetch reasonable prices (Tretchikoff print about \u00a330; Barget bar, \u00a3150; American dinette table, \u00a3750). In fact, Lucie often sells pieces she's grown tired of or can't fit into her house - though she still has a wish list of things she would always find room for. 'I've always wanted a Miss Mixer Martini shaker,' she says. 'She wobbles her boobs around while shaking the drink.' Sounds ghastly? Well, yes, but this battery-operated Barbie lookalike is worth up to \u00a3150. London retro specialist Flying Duck Enterprises reports a waiting list. 'I don't know why I collect,' says Lucie.

      "body": "<p>Take a peek inside the bathroom cabinet of just about any home and the chances are you will find a collection of half-used, long-forgotten medicine bottles, tablets and tonics. As a nation, we spend more than \u00a36bn on prescription drugs and another \u00a31.5bn on over-the-counter medicines every year, yet vast quantities are regularly flushed down the loo or left to gather dust in cupboards.</p> <p>The fact is that all too frequently the medication we optimistically pick up at the chemist is then abandoned - either because it didn't work at all or because it made us feel a whole lot worse. The reason for this is simply that we are all different. Just as some of us have blue eyes and blond hair while others have big noses and freckles, our genetic make-up means we all react differently to different medicines, which makes taking them a bit of a lottery.</p> <p>Fast forward to 2010. You visit your GP with, say, asthma, or migraine, or high blood pressure. After a simple test from a mouth swab, your doctor then prescribes the exact dose of a medicine tailor made to work for you with minimal side effects. This is not science fiction. Opinions may vary about the date, but scientists agree that before long we will all be taking designer drugs - in the nicest possible sense.</p> <p>This breakthrough will revolutionise health care. Personalised medicine should make clinical treatment safer and more effective, saving money and lives. It will mean medicines can be created which are custom made to suit particular genetic types. The technology already exists. The knowledge - gained through the efforts of the human genome project to map our genetic make-up - is rapidly emerging. And clinical trials are already taking place in which patients are genetically selected for the drugs that will work best for them. Indeed, of all areas of genetic research, scientists believe personalised medicine - properly called pharmacogenetics - is likely to have the greatest effect soonest.</p> <p>'I think it is a very exciting time,' says Professor Tony Moffat, chief scientist at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. 'Some time in the near future we're going to have diagnostic tests made available that will allow us to choose the right drug at the right dose for the right patient.'</p> <p>It will, he says, be a huge advance on existing practice. Currently, prescribing medicines is often a game of trial and error. Visit a doctor with a particular complaint and you will be prescribed the standard medicine at the standard dose. Yet the human genome project has shown that while we are all 99.9 per cent identical, we are each also significantly different and these variations in genetic makeup apply to our responses to drugs. We all vary in the way our bodies absorb, transport and process different medicines, so the same drug may work perfectly in one person, not at all in another and cause toxic effects in a third.</p> <p>Research in the US has shown that side effects of medicines are the fourth commonest reason people end up in hospital and the fifth leading cause of death. There is no reason, says Professor Moffat, to believe the situation is any different here. Indeed, the Medicines Control Agency (MCA), which records adverse drug reactions in the UK, received 32,666 reports last year, including 309 deaths - although this may not have been due to the drug reactions in all cases.</p> <p>The risks are already well understood. People process different medicines at vastly different rates. When drugs are metabolised slowly, they stay in people's systems too long with potentially fatal results. Poor metabolisers of succinylcholine, an injection given to relax muscles before operations for example, may remain paralysed for many hours after their surgery and even die. Figures from the MCA show 356 people have suffered adverse reactions to succinylcholine since 1967, and 47 have died. Other drugs can have similarly disastrous effects. Slow metabolisers of warfarin, used to treat thrombosis and prevent strokes, may bleed to death. MCA figures show that there have been 1,156 suspected adverse reactions to warfarin since 1964, including 168 deaths.</p> <p>At the same time, Professor Moffat explains, genetic variations mean many common drugs just don't work for some people. Beta-blockers, used to treat heart conditions, are ineffective for one in five people. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as Prozac, fail to work for a quarter of people. Drugs prescribed for schizophrenia are ineffective in a colossal 94 per cent of people. Effectively, each schizophrenia drug has a one in 20 chance of working.</p> <p>Frequently this hit-and-miss affair means patients have to return to their doctor several times to try different drugs at different doses, says Professor Moffat. Since some drugs, like the SSRIs, take several weeks to work at all, the process can be slow as well as wasteful. It is not surprising many patients give up.</p> <p>In future, genetic tests will predict how well a certain drug will work for a particular patient. Using this information, the doctor or pharmacist can then alter the dose or prescribe a different drug. The test, which is different to the controversial genetic tests used to screen for predisposition to inherited diseases, is already available. Pharmaceutical companies now use such tests in the trials of new medicines to eliminate patients who would either not respond or would respond badly to the drug. This not only makes the results look better - trials only include patients on which companies know the drug will work - but may give them the edge over competitors if they can assure doctors a new pill will work for a given group of patients.</p> <p>Existing medicines are also being analysed to determine who they will best work for. UK-based company Bristol-Myers Squibb is studying genetic variations in patients with cancer, to assess who will respond best to its oncology medicines. Novartis is undertaking research in Britain to determine which patients respond best to its asthma drugs.</p> <p>Allen Roses, an expert in genetic diseases with British-based GlaxoSmithKline, says: 'Potentially, this could save enormous numbers of lives and cost.' Instead of selling a drug which is only effective in 60 per cent of people, companies will be able to offer medicines that are 100 per cent effective in a smaller band of patients, he explains. He also believes that this advance may even give a new lease of life to medicines previously banned due to harmful side effects, which could be reintroduced with a licence only for certain, safe, genetic types.</p> <p>Currently pharmacogenetic tests are too expensive for general use. But costs are expected to fall rapidly so that eventually all of us will have the test carried out - possibly at birth - with the results kept centrally on computer or on a personal smart card.</p> <p>A handful of people, however, have already undergone tests privately through a laboratory service, LGC, which performs tests for the pharmaceutical industry. After taking the test himself, Dr Paul Debenham, head of life sciences at LGC, found that he was a poor metaboliser for certain drugs. Like eight per cent of Caucasian people - metabolism rates vary among ethnic groups - he has a deficiency in the enzyme CYP2D6. This makes him slow to process about a quarter of common drugs, including beta-blockers and pain relievers; they stay in his system too long so are potentially too powerful.</p> <p>'If I am prescribed a medicine, I would certainly now go to the drugs manuals and see whether it is affected by CYP2D6,' he says. He predicts many more people will soon start demanding the tests once they realise their relevance. Theoretically, he believes, patients may even have a legal case against doctors who prescribe a drug with a predictably toxic effect when a reliable test is available.</p> <p>Patients' groups are rapidly realising the potential benefits of pharmacogenetics. Alastair Kent, director of the Genetic Interest Group, which represents 130 patients' organisations, sees personalised medicine as the least controversial offshoot of genetics. 'It should lead to better outcomes, fewer harmful effects for patients and therefore better compliance,' he says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the NHS is watching developments keenly. 'It should be a win-win situation,' says Dr Ron Zimmern, director of the Public Health Genetics Unit, which monitors genetics advances for the NHS. 'Safer, more effective drugs should reduce costs to the NHS, by avoiding wasted medicines and treatment of adverse side effects'. But question marks remain, he cautions, over funding, timing and logistics.</p> <p>Nobody knows the likely cost of testing the population, nor who will pick up the bill. Drugs manufacturers may bump up their prices if they have to limit certain drugs to smaller groups of people. Eventually, says Dr Zimmern, if certain drugs are known not to work or to cause toxic effects in some people, they might only be licensed to treat particular genetic types.</p> <p>And the pace of change towards this medicine nirvana is anyone's guess. Expert predictions vary from five to 30 years, according to Dr Zimmern. But however long it takes, he adds, one thing is certain: 'There is no doubt that pharmacogenetics is going to change the way we prescribe and practise medicine.'</p> <p><b> Letting the genie out of the bottle</b></p> <p>Everyone responds very differently to different drugs.

Common examples include: \u0095 Codeine: the painkiller is activated by an enzyme which converts some of the drug into morphine which then tackles the pain. In the minority of people who lack this enzyme, codeine fails to work. \u0095 Debrisoquine: the rate at which people process or metabolise this drug, which is used to treat high blood pressure, varies 20-fold. \u0095 Ecstasy: about 8 per cent of Caucasians lack the enzyme needed to metabolise ecstasy. Doctors suggest this may explain why some people die after a single tablet. \u0095 Statins: these drugs used to treat heart disease are ineffective in between 30 per cent and 70 per cent of people.

Items can be ordered individually (a cup with a lid and straw, 20p; a glow-in-the-dark skeleton, 70p), but a full package of accessories (including anything from a pink Cadillac to a jungle jeep in which to present your sandwiches, chips, burgers and fruit) for an average-sized party should work out at around \u00a325.</p> <p>If you want to do kiddy things with kids, consider spending a 'Funday Sunday' at Smollensky's (105 The Strand, London WC2, 020 7497 2101; and 255 Finchley Road, London NW3, 020 7431 5007) between 12 noon and 4pm. There is a clown and a magician - as well as the waiter and chef - plus activity sheets, 3-D 'wikki stix' and screenings of various children's films.

There is a clown and a magician - as well as the waiter and chef - plus activity sheets, 3-D 'wikki stix' and screenings of various children's films. Kids can eat anything from Caesar salad, via penne with tomato sauce, to chocolate mousse or banana split. For a more serious approach to eating out, consider the proposition that children are small adults, and that if they are treated as grown-ups they will behave in an appropriately sophisticated way. To test the theory, put yourself in the hands of child-friendly restauranteurs such as Giorgio Locatelli at Zafferano (15 Lowndes Street, London SW1, 020 7235 5800), Bill and Sukie Barber at Old Pines (Spean Bridge, Fort William, 01397 712 324), Michael and Lucy Hjort at Melton's (7 Scarcroft Road, York, 01904 634 341) or Raymond Blanc at Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons (Great Milton, Oxon; 01844 278 881). \u0095 Jim Ainsworth is editor of The Good Food Guide.",

He gave me some advice, and in the end I designed three and they all went into the Festival.

Two rival versions of NTV news were aired on two different channels throughout the day, as both halves of the splintered editorial team struggled to continue their work. A large team of private security guards, hired by Gazprom, swarmed into the Ostankino television complex at 3am, catching rebellious staff off guard at a time when the NTV studios were almost deserted. The team was under instruction to refuse entry to those journalists who had fought hardest against the takeover. Shortly before dawn, the station's new editor-in-chief arrived with the American businessman Boris Jordan, who was named director of the station in a controversial boardroom coup 12 days ago.

Opponents have pointed out the dispute between NTV and Gazprom is more complex than simply a fight for freedom of speech in the face of government repression, not least because Gazprom is owed $200m (\u00a3140m) in unpaid loans by NTV. The true independence of Gusinsky's media holding has been called into question by those who remember how NTV abandoned its editorial objectivity in the run-up to the 1996 presidential election campaign, making a pact with powerful Russian business figures to ensure victory for Boris Yeltsin. But liberal politicians, like the leader of the Yabloko party, Grigory Yavlinksy, who has been campaigning on behalf of NTV's former management, insist that the complexities of the situation deflect from the single crucial point at the heart of the crisis: that once NTV falls into state hands all Russia's national television channels will be loyal to the Kremlin.

Wahid, an almost blind Muslim cleric who became Indonesia's first democratically elected President in October 1999, is close to being ousted by an increasingly hostile parliament.

      "body": "<p>The ghetto has not looked like this, they say, since the days after Martin Luther King was assassinated. Cincinnati's dark streets are ghostly and deserted; the only sounds are the wails of sirens in the mid-distance and the drone of helicopters casting their searchlight beams across the spectral slumscape.</p> <p>The only movement is that of the State Troopers' grey patrol cars and white armoured vans full of helmeted riot police, more Blade Runner than a busy metropolis on the shores of the wide Ohio. The streets had emptied on Friday night as an 8pm curfew fell across the last golden sunlight.</p> <p>Downtown, only the birds chirped and signs flapped as the last office workers hurried for their cars loaded up with take-out food. Only a few stragglers outside O'Byron's pub refused to believe this was happening on Good Friday.</p> <p>In the ghetto, a church rally by the leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People had ended abruptly to the anger of his audience. 'It wasn't enough time,' said one Dead Hawkins, 'We're going away mad.'</p> <p>The NAACP's president Kweisi Mfume had clasped hands with the still dazed mother of the boy whose shooting by a police officer had provoked the scenes of only 18 hours earlier - another, more tumultuous, first for Cincinnati since 1967: fury and shooting, burning and looting which - after two nights of the usual tragic wreckage within the ghetto confines - had broken onto the white man's turf.</p> <p>This time, the cops were charging for real and the crowd was shooting back - an officer was slightly wounded. This time, Swat teams were throwing up barricades and their snipers leaping over the rooftops. Every American riot tells a story, and on the surface it is the same: an incident undams years of tension between angry and poor black youths and a white police force stained by racism - whether in Cincinnati or its big cousins, Detroit and Chicago in the North, Los Angeles or Miami in the South.</p> <p>Like its northern counterparts, Cincinnati's slums were once middle-class neighbourhoods into which white Appalachian hillbillies moved first, then sharecroppers from the plantations in the great migration north. Time was when blacks taking the trains south from Cincinnati's great Union Terminal would have to occupy segregated compartments, while those arriving would be travelling with the whites.</p> <p>Cincinnati's ghetto is unique - indeed 'ghetto' is hardly the right term in an urban area that is 43 per cent black. It is called Over-the-Rhine, a name explicable by the moulded lettering on the front of the church that towers over the place: 'Deutsche Protestantische St. Johannes-kirche. 1865' - now the Apostolic Bethlehem church.</p> <p>The community was founded by German immigrants and is one of America's nineteenth-century urban wonders: buildings of a design made more famous in San Francisco, only of brick, adorned by iron thickets of fire escape ladders. The world has seen these streets in the movie Traffic, with all its familiar ghetto hallmarks - ubiquitous porn shops and a rough-and-tumble summer street life.</p> <p>It was here that Timothy Thomas was raised and drove his 1978 Chevy around. Eleven times since March 2000 he had been stopped by police and cited for 12 offences, mostly driving without carrying his licence or not wearing a seatbelt. The core of the row that rages not only here but across the US is that Timothy was victim of what is politely called 'racial profiling' - that is, he was picked on because he was black.</p> <p>Twice he ran from the police as they chased him and twice slipped the net, but the third time he died from a bullet fired by officer Steve Roach. He fell lifeless outside an abandoned building in a little alleyway, number 1313 Republic Street, where the tributes are modest - bottles of wine or beer on his flagstone deathbed, and a placard: 'No seatbelt equals death.'</p> <p>'It just goes on and on,' said Melvin Wills, hanging an arm out of his car at the corner of Republic and 13th. And so it does in Cincinnati, for it was not only Timothy's death that caused the rioting.</p> <p>Eighteen black men and boys have been shot dead by the police in Over-the-Rhine since the start of last year - a concentration of police violence that outstrips any other US city. The Rev Fred Shuttlesworth, who marched with Martin Luther King from Birmingham to Selma in the great hike of the 1960s, remains a minister in Cincinnati, of the Greater New Light Baptist church.</p> <p>He is now 79 but has been on the streets all week, sleepless. 'Race relations haven't changed very much since those days,' he ponders now. 'If anything, things are worse if everybody thinks they have changed yet, in reality, those changes are not every blood-vein deep - then the system never really changed.'</p> <p>His home town of Cincinnati, he says, 'has had time to change, but the whites have blocked progress and the police is more a prosecutor than a protector. The anger is justified but the violence is not. However, people will rebel if they don't see themselves progress. The riots happening now are the result of Cincinnati not responding to change.'</p> <p>Although the mayor Charlie Luken is no Rudy Giuliani and admits to 'a serious race relations problem', there are few northern cities in which blacks are so proportionately unrepresented in the police or government. While unemployment is minimal among whites at 2 per cent, it tops 20 per cent in Over-the-Rhine; in schools there is almost total segregation. Current census figures show Greater Cincinnati to be the eighth most segregated metropolitan region in the U.S. The city lost nearly 45,000 whites, leaving an urban area that is 43 per cent black with middle-class blacks also fleeing the slums around the city centre.</p> <p>Another veteran who saw this coming is Cecil Thomas, who left the police to head the city's Human Relations Commission. He warned that Cincinnati was 'one questionable shooting away from riots,' and on Wednesday was one of a group of 20 who formed a human wedge between an advancing crowd of youths and columns of riot police just as the confrontation was about to blow, physically separating each side. Then the police advanced and a man called Larry Brenton shouted: 'We need to take this fucking city down! I'm tired of getting up every morning and finding out someone else I knew has been murdered by the police.'</p> <p>Uprisings invariably throw up leaders and in this case the figure is the Rev Damon Lynch. Whatever President George Bush intended by placing his trust in 'faith-based' leaders, it is unlikely he had people like Lynch in mind. Pastor of the New Prospect Baptist Church in the heart of the ghetto, he wears a gold earring, was with Cecil Thomas in that human wedge, then stayed on the front lines of the demonstrations as police horses and then plastic bullets were unleashed across the boulevards around the ghetto.</p> <p>The following day, outside his church office window, children played on swings in a scrappy playground as he prepared to host yesterday's funeral of Timothy Thomas. All afternoon his cell phone rang with calls about arrangements for the presence of the Governor and the Mayor - unsettled enough to make sure that they spent their Easter Saturday attending the last rites of a serial traffic offender. So too would a crowd of thousands on the steets outside the church - and the hundreds of riot police, unsure whether the precarious peace that had almost held since Wednesday's violence could last the weekend after the funeral.</p> <p>'Is it consistent?' asks Pastor Lynch. 'We've had 15 young blacks killed by the police since 1995 and seven since November - I call that consistent. In every case except one the officer was white.' Cincinnati, he says, now incorporates, 'the worst of the North and the worst of the South. It's a southern town trying to be a northern metropolis and it's not. Racism here is worse than in the new South and the police come from within that culture from the west side of town where the blacks just don't go - they'd be lynched, it's not our town. There, they learn that African Americans are the scum of the earth - then they are sent here.'</p> <p>What motivates Pastor Lynch - politics, faith, or what? 'It ain't politics,' he almost snaps.

      "bodyText": "The ghetto has not looked like this, they say, since the days after Martin Luther King was assassinated. Cincinnati's dark streets are ghostly and deserted; the only sounds are the wails of sirens in the mid-distance and the drone of helicopters casting their searchlight beams across the spectral slumscape. The only movement is that of the State Troopers' grey patrol cars and white armoured vans full of helmeted riot police, more Blade Runner than a busy metropolis on the shores of the wide Ohio. The streets had emptied on Friday night as an 8pm curfew fell across the last golden sunlight. Downtown, only the birds chirped and signs flapped as the last office workers hurried for their cars loaded up with take-out food. Only a few stragglers outside O'Byron's pub refused to believe this was happening on Good Friday. In the ghetto, a church rally by the leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People had ended abruptly to the anger of his audience. 'It wasn't enough time,' said one Dead Hawkins, 'We're going away mad.' The NAACP's president Kweisi Mfume had clasped hands with the still dazed mother of the boy whose shooting by a police officer had provoked the scenes of only 18 hours earlier - another, more tumultuous, first for Cincinnati since 1967: fury and shooting, burning and looting which - after two nights of the usual tragic wreckage within the ghetto confines - had broken onto the white man's turf. This time, the cops were charging for real and the crowd was shooting back - an officer was slightly wounded. This time, Swat teams were throwing up barricades and their snipers leaping over the rooftops. Every American riot tells a story, and on the surface it is the same: an incident undams years of tension between angry and poor black youths and a white police force stained by racism - whether in Cincinnati or its big cousins, Detroit and Chicago in the North, Los Angeles or Miami in the South. Like its northern counterparts, Cincinnati's slums were once middle-class neighbourhoods into which white Appalachian hillbillies moved first, then sharecroppers from the plantations in the great migration north. Time was when blacks taking the trains south from Cincinnati's great Union Terminal would have to occupy segregated compartments, while those arriving would be travelling with the whites. Cincinnati's ghetto is unique - indeed 'ghetto' is hardly the right term in an urban area that is 43 per cent black. It is called Over-the-Rhine, a name explicable by the moulded lettering on the front of the church that towers over the place: 'Deutsche Protestantische St. Johannes-kirche. 1865' - now the Apostolic Bethlehem church. The community was founded by German immigrants and is one of America's nineteenth-century urban wonders: buildings of a design made more famous in San Francisco, only of brick, adorned by iron thickets of fire escape ladders. The world has seen these streets in the movie Traffic, with all its familiar ghetto hallmarks - ubiquitous porn shops and a rough-and-tumble summer street life. It was here that Timothy Thomas was raised and drove his 1978 Chevy around. Eleven times since March 2000 he had been stopped by police and cited for 12 offences, mostly driving without carrying his licence or not wearing a seatbelt. The core of the row that rages not only here but across the US is that Timothy was victim of what is politely called 'racial profiling' - that is, he was picked on because he was black. Twice he ran from the police as they chased him and twice slipped the net, but the third time he died from a bullet fired by officer Steve Roach. He fell lifeless outside an abandoned building in a little alleyway, number 1313 Republic Street, where the tributes are modest - bottles of wine or beer on his flagstone deathbed, and a placard: 'No seatbelt equals death.' 'It just goes on and on,' said Melvin Wills, hanging an arm out of his car at the corner of Republic and 13th. And so it does in Cincinnati, for it was not only Timothy's death that caused the rioting. Eighteen black men and boys have been shot dead by the police in Over-the-Rhine since the start of last year - a concentration of police violence that outstrips any other US city. The Rev Fred Shuttlesworth, who marched with Martin Luther King from Birmingham to Selma in the great hike of the 1960s, remains a minister in Cincinnati, of the Greater New Light Baptist church. He is now 79 but has been on the streets all week, sleepless. 'Race relations haven't changed very much since those days,' he ponders now. 'If anything, things are worse if everybody thinks they have changed yet, in reality, those changes are not every blood-vein deep - then the system never really changed.' His home town of Cincinnati, he says, 'has had time to change, but the whites have blocked progress and the police is more a prosecutor than a protector. The anger is justified but the violence is not. However, people will rebel if they don't see themselves progress. The riots happening now are the result of Cincinnati not responding to change.' Although the mayor Charlie Luken is no Rudy Giuliani and admits to 'a serious race relations problem', there are few northern cities in which blacks are so proportionately unrepresented in the police or government. While unemployment is minimal among whites at 2 per cent, it tops 20 per cent in Over-the-Rhine; in schools there is almost total segregation. Current census figures show Greater Cincinnati to be the eighth most segregated metropolitan region in the U.S. The city lost nearly 45,000 whites, leaving an urban area that is 43 per cent black with middle-class blacks also fleeing the slums around the city centre. Another veteran who saw this coming is Cecil Thomas, who left the police to head the city's Human Relations Commission. He warned that Cincinnati was 'one questionable shooting away from riots,' and on Wednesday was one of a group of 20 who formed a human wedge between an advancing crowd of youths and columns of riot police just as the confrontation was about to blow, physically separating each side. Then the police advanced and a man called Larry Brenton shouted: 'We need to take this fucking city down! I'm tired of getting up every morning and finding out someone else I knew has been murdered by the police.' Uprisings invariably throw up leaders and in this case the figure is the Rev Damon Lynch. Whatever President George Bush intended by placing his trust in 'faith-based' leaders, it is unlikely he had people like Lynch in mind. Pastor of the New Prospect Baptist Church in the heart of the ghetto, he wears a gold earring, was with Cecil Thomas in that human wedge, then stayed on the front lines of the demonstrations as police horses and then plastic bullets were unleashed across the boulevards around the ghetto. The following day, outside his church office window, children played on swings in a scrappy playground as he prepared to host yesterday's funeral of Timothy Thomas. All afternoon his cell phone rang with calls about arrangements for the presence of the Governor and the Mayor - unsettled enough to make sure that they spent their Easter Saturday attending the last rites of a serial traffic offender. So too would a crowd of thousands on the steets outside the church - and the hundreds of riot police, unsure whether the precarious peace that had almost held since Wednesday's violence could last the weekend after the funeral. 'Is it consistent?' asks Pastor Lynch. 'We've had 15 young blacks killed by the police since 1995 and seven since November - I call that consistent. In every case except one the officer was white.' Cincinnati, he says, now incorporates, 'the worst of the North and the worst of the South. It's a southern town trying to be a northern metropolis and it's not. Racism here is worse than in the new South and the police come from within that culture from the west side of town where the blacks just don't go - they'd be lynched, it's not our town. There, they learn that African Americans are the scum of the earth - then they are sent here.' What motivates Pastor Lynch - politics, faith, or what? 'It ain't politics,' he almost snaps. 'It's faith. It's my calling. It's what God asks of me.' He has a portrait of Martin Luther King on the wall and a Koran on the floor. 'This is Easter time,' he says, 'Today is Good Friday and we mourn. Tomorrow we bury the kid, and on Sunday we look for the resurrection of our community. Three days of Easter.' A man called Chuck Walters walks in and says: 'Keep praying, brother, we're with you.' Later, outside with friends, he asks to see the pastor's list of 18 men killed since February 1995. He points at the name of Alfred Pope, shot dead in March last year. 'That's my stepson, found with 10 gunshot wounds in his back, handcuffed from behind in the surrender position.

The cops' families come up here from Kentucky and the hills where all they can talk about is niggers. We're tired of being treated this a-way.' On Good Friday evening, women and the elderly chatter on steps beneath the fire escapes while the men collect in groups to banter. The riot police vans prowl the little streets, and choppers fly low above the rooftops. There's a bar called the Race Cafi (on Race Street) where drinkers are squeezing in a last Schlitz before curfew.

Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, the late Socialist President, also lost patience with France's only woman Prime Minister, Edith Cresson, dismissing her after only 10 months when she complained of her incapacity to control her male-dominated Cabinet. Jospin is unlikely to endorse Jupp\u00e9's opinion of his female colleagues but he will be glad when Voynet leaves in June. She will take charge of the Green Party's pre-electoral plans after attacking Jospin's strategy and describing his entourage as 'creeps'. Jospin's second presidential bid after losing to Jacques Chirac in 1995 hangs on reaction to his pre-electoral programme, which he will defend on television on Tuesday after a cool reception by his Communist and Green partners. The plan includes about 40 mini-reforms ranging from better welfare to anti-crime measures. By then, one of the most damaging strikes - a fortnight's protest by railwaymen - should be over, but he still has to overcome Communist claims that he has pursued right-wing policies. His government's main reform, introduction of a 35-hour a week and the creation of a million jobs, has not overcome suspicion of complacency towards big business. The Prime Minister's dilemma could be Voltaire's fault. Mireille Jospin's battle for the midwives has revived the story of Jospin's precocious intellectual influence. Like his three brothers and sisters, he was born at home but his parents' bed was out of bounds because his sister was confined there with measles. A sofa was pressed into service but was too low and had to be propped with the entire collection of the philosopher's bound works.",

      "body": "<p>Ken Umoli travelled a long way to get to Tangier. But the young Nigerian remembers the worst moment of the six-month journey as if it were yesterday. Trekking through the Sahara somewhere near the border between Mali and Mauritania, one of his companions, a Senegalese man, ran out of water. The man begged to be given some of his friends' precious supplies, but Umoli and the others knew that to do so would risk death themselves.</p> <p>So they left him to perish under the hot sun. They walked on, ignoring his cries for help, which soon faded. He died in the sands. They made it to the next oasis.</p> <p>'It was a difficult thing, but what else could we do? There are a lot of bodies in that desert. Sometimes you see bones by the roadside. They are all Africans heading for Europe,' Umoli said last week.</p> <p>The journeys of refugees like Umoli to Tangier start in countless places all over Africa, from the villages of Nigeria to the slums of Senegal and the war zones of Sierra Leone. The lure of getting to Europe and securing a job in its buoyant economy is a powerful attraction to Africa's millions of poor and needy.</p> <p>The routes they follow are tortuous and varied. The lucky few work for years and save up the money to fly to Morocco; others catch buses or hitch lifts. Thousands simply walk. They always head north, usually passing through Mali and its ramshackle capital, Bamoko, before attempting the deadly Sahara.</p> <p>Many die on the way. They fall victim to bandits and robbers, or merciless smugglers who steal their few possessions and take their lives. Or, like Umoli's Senegalese friend, they fall victim to the heat, perhaps getting lost in the shifting sands, their bodies never found. Their relatives back home will never know if they achieved the dream of a better life or died on the way. The trip can take up to two years.</p> <p>But if the starting points are many, the end is usually the same. The North African coast at Tangier is nine miles from Europe. It is a short distance across the Straits of Gibraltar - and from there on to Britain, Germany, Switzerland, anywhere there are jobs. But the trip across the water is the most deadly leg of the journey.</p> <p>The Straits have been called the largest mass grave in Europe. Over the past three years it is thought 3,000 people have died attempting to cross.</p> <p>The currents in the Straits, where the Mediterranean meets the Atlantic, are strong. If a boat engine dies or runs out of fuel, the craft can drift out into the ocean. Death does not come quickly to the terrified passengers crammed together. First comes the thirst, then the sunstroke. Those who fall in the water risk fuel burns from the petrol slicks floating on the waves.</p> <p>Some boats are hit by the tankers and ferries sailing through the Straits, the busiest shipping lane in the world. The massive ships do not even notice the tiny rafts ahead of them as their bow waves swamp the dinghies, sending men and women tumbling into the sea.</p> <p>In the public cemetery at Tarifa, on the southernmost tip of Spain, there are rows of unmarked graves reserved for the corpses washed up on the shore. Sometimes the bodies are buried three to a plot. The graves are one of the few visible reminders of the tragic exodus. Most bodies are carried out into the Atlantic.</p> <p>Despite the risks, hundreds of Africans still come to Tangier where they wait, struggling to raise the money to pay smugglers to take them across. Each Friday at the Western Union branch in the city, crowds of Africans gather, eager to see if relatives have sent them cash to make the crossing.</p> <p>Ben, also Nigerian, has been waiting in Tangier for two years and still can't raise the smugglers' 'fare'. His wait for help has been in vain. 'I have no money. Only God can help me now,' he said. But still he will not go back. He told me he was 25, but looked barely out of his teens.</p> <p>There are probably 500 Africans in the city waiting to migrate and hundreds more camped out in the bush around Tangier and along the coast.</p> <p>The smugglers' boats leave on any night when the conditions are right. The places of those leaving on the boats are quickly filled by those arriving in the city. Their story is always the same. They have fled poverty or war back home and want a new life and a job in Europe. Umoli has a tattered blue notebook crammed full of website addresses for universities in Britain. He wants to study economics at Bristol.</p> <p>'Life is a risk. You have to take risks to get what you want,' he said, sitting on a mattress in a dingy hostel deep in the old city of Tangier. Above his bed, scribbled on the wall, was a brief message from a previous African occupant of the room - one who might have made it, or might have died. 'O Lord hear to my cry, give ear to my prayer,' it read.</p> <p>Abdul and Mohammed are people smugglers. If Umoli is going to get across he will need the help of the likes of them, middlemen who arrange deals between the Africans and the kingpins controlling the trafficking routes.</p> <p>They were sitting in the upstairs room of a caf\u00e9 surrounded by a fug of hashish smoke from a joint they passed between them. In front of them sat a Nigerian, Sunday Fawi Adebiye, who had been waiting for an uncle in America to send him money.</p> <p>Abdul listened to the Nigerian's story, pretending to be sympathetic.</p> <p>'Soon, soon, maybe there will be a boat for you. But you need the money,' Abdul said, gripping Adebiye's arm in a friendly gesture. Then he reeled off a sliding scale of prices, ranging from a basic trip to going across and straight into a pre-arranged job in Spain.</p> <p>Adebiye looked hopeful. But, of course, Abdul was lying: there will be no job waiting in Spain. No matter how much is paid, the service is always the same: you trust your life to a flimsy inflatable dinghy; the boat heads for Spain and, if you live, you will be dumped on the shore or caught by the coastguard.</p> <p>'We just put them in the Zodiac, off they go and then we pray that they will be safe,' Abdul said.</p> <p>Some boats are piloted by the refugees themselves, others by Moroccans, and usually also carry drugs, mostly hashish but sometimes heroin and cocaine. Drugs are intrinsic to the smuggling rings. It is a dangerous business and it is run by ruthless men who have no illusions about what is more valuable to them - drugs or people.</p> <p>The smugglers pay huge bribes to the police and customs to allow them to carry out their trade in Tangier, but the refugees still face an uncertain existence there, playing a constant game of cat and mouse with the authorities.</p> <p>Fearing arrest if caught on the street, most would-be immigrants in Tangier rarely emerge from their cheap boarding houses. They go out only occasionally into one square, which is surrounded by tall walls. They used to go to an outside terrace nearby, from where you can see Europe on the horizon. But no more: police raids have been frequent.</p> <p>When they are picked up the refugees are taken to the Algerian border and dumped there in 'no man's land'. But they always return.</p> <p>As their taxi bumped down a rough track to a rocky beach last week, Mohammed and Abdul pointed out a spot where a dinghy had left for Spain the night before.</p> <p>Wearing several layers of clothing and clutching their belongings in bin liners, the desperate migrants had crowded into the boat and headed for Spain.

      "bodyText": "Ken Umoli travelled a long way to get to Tangier. But the young Nigerian remembers the worst moment of the six-month journey as if it were yesterday. Trekking through the Sahara somewhere near the border between Mali and Mauritania, one of his companions, a Senegalese man, ran out of water. The man begged to be given some of his friends' precious supplies, but Umoli and the others knew that to do so would risk death themselves. So they left him to perish under the hot sun. They walked on, ignoring his cries for help, which soon faded. He died in the sands. They made it to the next oasis. 'It was a difficult thing, but what else could we do? There are a lot of bodies in that desert. Sometimes you see bones by the roadside. They are all Africans heading for Europe,' Umoli said last week. The journeys of refugees like Umoli to Tangier start in countless places all over Africa, from the villages of Nigeria to the slums of Senegal and the war zones of Sierra Leone. The lure of getting to Europe and securing a job in its buoyant economy is a powerful attraction to Africa's millions of poor and needy. The routes they follow are tortuous and varied. The lucky few work for years and save up the money to fly to Morocco; others catch buses or hitch lifts. Thousands simply walk. They always head north, usually passing through Mali and its ramshackle capital, Bamoko, before attempting the deadly Sahara. Many die on the way. They fall victim to bandits and robbers, or merciless smugglers who steal their few possessions and take their lives. Or, like Umoli's Senegalese friend, they fall victim to the heat, perhaps getting lost in the shifting sands, their bodies never found. Their relatives back home will never know if they achieved the dream of a better life or died on the way. The trip can take up to two years. But if the starting points are many, the end is usually the same. The North African coast at Tangier is nine miles from Europe. It is a short distance across the Straits of Gibraltar - and from there on to Britain, Germany, Switzerland, anywhere there are jobs. But the trip across the water is the most deadly leg of the journey. The Straits have been called the largest mass grave in Europe. Over the past three years it is thought 3,000 people have died attempting to cross. The currents in the Straits, where the Mediterranean meets the Atlantic, are strong. If a boat engine dies or runs out of fuel, the craft can drift out into the ocean. Death does not come quickly to the terrified passengers crammed together. First comes the thirst, then the sunstroke. Those who fall in the water risk fuel burns from the petrol slicks floating on the waves. Some boats are hit by the tankers and ferries sailing through the Straits, the busiest shipping lane in the world. The massive ships do not even notice the tiny rafts ahead of them as their bow waves swamp the dinghies, sending men and women tumbling into the sea. In the public cemetery at Tarifa, on the southernmost tip of Spain, there are rows of unmarked graves reserved for the corpses washed up on the shore. Sometimes the bodies are buried three to a plot. The graves are one of the few visible reminders of the tragic exodus. Most bodies are carried out into the Atlantic. Despite the risks, hundreds of Africans still come to Tangier where they wait, struggling to raise the money to pay smugglers to take them across. Each Friday at the Western Union branch in the city, crowds of Africans gather, eager to see if relatives have sent them cash to make the crossing. Ben, also Nigerian, has been waiting in Tangier for two years and still can't raise the smugglers' 'fare'. His wait for help has been in vain. 'I have no money. Only God can help me now,' he said. But still he will not go back. He told me he was 25, but looked barely out of his teens. There are probably 500 Africans in the city waiting to migrate and hundreds more camped out in the bush around Tangier and along the coast. The smugglers' boats leave on any night when the conditions are right. The places of those leaving on the boats are quickly filled by those arriving in the city. Their story is always the same. They have fled poverty or war back home and want a new life and a job in Europe. Umoli has a tattered blue notebook crammed full of website addresses for universities in Britain. He wants to study economics at Bristol. 'Life is a risk. You have to take risks to get what you want,' he said, sitting on a mattress in a dingy hostel deep in the old city of Tangier. Above his bed, scribbled on the wall, was a brief message from a previous African occupant of the room - one who might have made it, or might have died. 'O Lord hear to my cry, give ear to my prayer,' it read. Abdul and Mohammed are people smugglers. If Umoli is going to get across he will need the help of the likes of them, middlemen who arrange deals between the Africans and the kingpins controlling the trafficking routes. They were sitting in the upstairs room of a caf\u00e9 surrounded by a fug of hashish smoke from a joint they passed between them. In front of them sat a Nigerian, Sunday Fawi Adebiye, who had been waiting for an uncle in America to send him money. Abdul listened to the Nigerian's story, pretending to be sympathetic. 'Soon, soon, maybe there will be a boat for you. But you need the money,' Abdul said, gripping Adebiye's arm in a friendly gesture. Then he reeled off a sliding scale of prices, ranging from a basic trip to going across and straight into a pre-arranged job in Spain. Adebiye looked hopeful. But, of course, Abdul was lying: there will be no job waiting in Spain. No matter how much is paid, the service is always the same: you trust your life to a flimsy inflatable dinghy; the boat heads for Spain and, if you live, you will be dumped on the shore or caught by the coastguard. 'We just put them in the Zodiac, off they go and then we pray that they will be safe,' Abdul said. Some boats are piloted by the refugees themselves, others by Moroccans, and usually also carry drugs, mostly hashish but sometimes heroin and cocaine. Drugs are intrinsic to the smuggling rings. It is a dangerous business and it is run by ruthless men who have no illusions about what is more valuable to them - drugs or people. The smugglers pay huge bribes to the police and customs to allow them to carry out their trade in Tangier, but the refugees still face an uncertain existence there, playing a constant game of cat and mouse with the authorities. Fearing arrest if caught on the street, most would-be immigrants in Tangier rarely emerge from their cheap boarding houses. They go out only occasionally into one square, which is surrounded by tall walls. They used to go to an outside terrace nearby, from where you can see Europe on the horizon. But no more: police raids have been frequent. When they are picked up the refugees are taken to the Algerian border and dumped there in 'no man's land'. But they always return. As their taxi bumped down a rough track to a rocky beach last week, Mohammed and Abdul pointed out a spot where a dinghy had left for Spain the night before. Wearing several layers of clothing and clutching their belongings in bin liners, the desperate migrants had crowded into the boat and headed for Spain. It carried 20 Africans and was piloted by two Moroccans. It also had a cargo of hashish. The journey was successful. Not so, however, a trip three weeks ago. Four bodies were washed up on the beaches of Tarifa, but refugees in Tangier told The Observer at least 30 people had been aboard and were all presumed dead. Mohammed was unmoved. The smugglers always get paid before the trip. If a dinghy sinks, they have lost nothing but a cheap rubber boat and they know there will always be more customers willing to pay up to $1,000 for the trip. 'Money talks, bullshit walks,' he said. For Ossas Osula the money and the risk was worth it. The 37-year-old Nigerian economist has finally made it to Europe. He has a flat in Malaga, about an hour's drive up the coast from Tarifa, and is waiting for his work permit. For those still stranded back in Tangier, Osula must seem a success story.

      "bodyText": "Premiums soar The cost of home insurance is going up for the first time in four years as insurers try to claw back money paid out on flood claims, says broker AA Insurance Services. Building insurance will now cost an average of \u00a3134 a year due to a rise in premiums of 1.62 per cent, while home contents insurance will be \u00a3107 after a 1.44 per cent rise in premiums. AA insurance services says it can shave more than 30 per cent off your premiums by scanning the market. Ring 0800 444 777. Taxing times More than 8.6 million people who last week received a tax return have until 31 January 2002 to submit the form. A \u00a3100 fine will be levied on people who miss that deadline. Those who want the Inland Revenue to calculate their tax are urged by the Revenue to get the form back four months earlier, by the end of September this year. Tax advisers encourage people doing their own returns to meet the 30 September deadline. Help is available in the Lloyds TSB 367-page paperback Tax Guide 2001/2002 (\u00a37.99 in bookshops). It is available at \u00a36.99 (including p&amp;p) to Observer readers on 020 8324 5530, bookshop@bvcd.prestel.co.uk or by sending a cheque to Profile Books, 250 Western Avenue, London W3 6EE. More for less If you are thinking of taking a city break this spring, your pound will stretch furthest in Istanbul and Stockholm, according to a survey by American Express Foreign Exchange. Of the 10 destinations surveyed, New York and Prague will leave you most out of pocket. In the Big Apple you will receive 11.43 per cent less than last year. In Paris, Amsterdam, Rome, Venice, Barcelona and Madrid you will receive around 3 per cent less for your sterling. In contrast you will get a whopping 56 per cent more Turkish lira to the pound, and 6 per cent more Swedish kroner, year on year.

Paying off debt is a good way to shore up against negative equity or the loss of your job. But, with deposit account interest rates falling and the stock market fluctuating, some lenders argue that homeowners should regard paying off their mortgage as an investment, too. </p> <p>Intelligent Finance, the internet and telephone bank, calculates that someone who invested \u00a325,000 in the stock market at the beginning of the year would have lost about \u00a32,500 by now. </p> <p>If they had used the money to 'offset' the mortgage interest on an IF current account mortgage, they would have reduced the cost of their mortgage repayments by more than \u00a3400 over the same period. </p> <p>The simplest way to overpay your mortgage is to continue making the same size of monthly payments when your interest rate is reduced. You should contact your lender's local branch to arrange this. But if you want more control over your money - the chance to withdraw equity, stop or reduce mortgage payments or repay early - consider a flexible mortgage. Fifty-seven lenders offer a version of the flexible loan. These vary considerably, so check the options to make sure they suit your circumstances. </p> <p>To help you decide which loan is right for you, Cash has asked mortgage broker London &amp; Country to recommend the best loans for different borrowers. </p> <p> <strong> 'I want to overpay regularly and be able to pay in lump sums as and when'</strong> </p> <p> If you don't need great flexibility apart from early repayment the main factor for choosing is likely to be price. Alliance &amp; Leicester offers a flexible loan discounted by 2.25 per cent for one year (giving an initial pay rate of 4.99 per cent), followed by a rate set at 0.95 per cent above the Bank of England's base rate for 10 years. There are no penalties at any time and interest is calculated monthly, so the benefit from overpayments will be felt almost immediately. </p> <p> <strong> 'I want to draw out money in the future and be able to take a payment holiday every now and again'</strong> </p> <p> Standard Life Bank not only allows borrowers to withdraw any overpayments made, but also to draw down equity in the property up to 90 per cent of its value. So, if you have borrowed \u00a375,000 on a home costing \u00a3100,000 but later find that you want to spend \u00a315,000 on a new car, you can draw that money from your mortgage account at whatever rate is being applied. You can also use the reserve to take payment holidays. Standard Life offers a discount of 1.76 per cent off its standard variable rate (currently 6.75 per cent but falling to 6.5 per cent at the end of April) for the first six months. </p> <p> <strong> 'I would like to combine my current account and mortgage to cut down the amount I have to pay'</strong> </p> <p>Intelligent Finance offers a current account-style mortgage that enables you to keep the different services separate. It offers current and savings accounts, personal loans, credit cards and mortgage, so you can see exactly how much you owe and how much you can spend. The choice of products is entirely yours - you don't have to switch your current account over to IF. Better still, any money in your current and/or savings accounts can be set against borrowings to reduce outstanding interest. For example, if you have a \u00a3100,000 loan but \u00a310,000 in your savings account you will only have to pay interest on \u00a390,000. IF offers a six-month discount of 1.5 per cent on its standard variable rate of 6.5 per cent (dropping to 6.25 per cent on 1 May). </p> <p> <strong> 'I'm a first-time buyer'</strong> </p> <p> First-time buyers are often on tight budgets and want fixed monthly payments. Britannic Money offers a fixed rate of 5.85 per cent for two years on its current account mortgage. Described by London &amp; Country's David Hollingworth as 'fantastic for first-time buyers', you can borrow up to 95 per cent of value with no mortgage indemnity guarantee (MIG) and no early redemption penalty. You also receive \u00a3150 towards the valuation fee and \u00a3200 towards legal costs. For a 25 per cent deposit, the rate is even lower at 5.35 per cent. </p> <p>The Woolwich's Offset Together mortgage enables parents or any other person to deposit money in an account that can be set against the cost of the mortgage. The parent retains control over the money and can withdraw or add to it at any time, but the borrower benefits from a reduction in the amount he or she has to pay every month. </p> <p>The Offset Together mortgage will lend you 3.25 times your income plus one times your partner's or 2.5 times joint income and up to 95 per cent of the property's value. However, interest is charged at the Offset standard variable rate, currently 6.25 per cent, and you will have to buy MIG if you are borrowing more than 90 per cent of value.</p> <p><strong>Stamp duty </strong></p> <p>The tax regime introduced in March 2000 levies no stamp duty on properties priced up to \u00a360,000. From \u00a360,001 to \u00a3250,000 it is 1 per cent. </p> <p>On properties from \u00a3250,001 to \u00a3500,000 it jumps up to 3 per cent, and a property valued at more than \u00a3500,000 has 4 per cent duty.</p> <p>Estate agents say these rises deter people from buying houses priced 'on the cusp' between different rates of duty. For example, someone buying a house on sale for \u00a3250,000 pays \u00a32,500 in duty. If the house is priced at \u00a3255,000, the buyer pays \u00a37,650.</p>",

Some accuse him of being aloof and arrogant, and say that Labour has failed to make a dent on the longer-term goals of improving public services and productivity, vital for raising living standards. </p> <p>In a remarkably candid defence of his four-year tenure, Brown said his policies had helped 'restore the work ethic' in parts of the country, and he went out of his way to give credit to other government departments. He also gave the first indication of Labour's plans for a second term, arguing that, as in the US, reforms aimed at increasing productivity take time to produce results. </p> <p>The Chancellor rejected criticism that New Labour had wasted its first term by keeping too tight a rein on public spending. </p> <p>'We had a \u00a328bn deficit; we had the prospect of a return to the old stop-go of the past with inflation rising. Disappointing as it was for some of the people staffing the public services, they must not forget that it's only because we tackled the deficit and took difficult decisions, some of which were very unpopular, that we managed to create the foundation from which we can build these sustainable rises.' </p> <p>Though spending growth has been slower than under the last Conservative government, Brown maintained that its quality was much better, and said spending would grow much faster over the next three years: 'What happened under the Major government was that more money was being spent, but on unemployment and debt interest. Because we've managed to reduce debt from 44 per cent to almost 30 per cent, we are now having to pay substantially less in interest payments, and that is additional money going to education and health. </p> <p>'So there are two things that have really happened. First, we are able to sustainably invest more and, second, more of what we are able to invest is going to the vital public services, the frontline services. When people look at that turnaround they'll see that it is now possible to look forward to sustainable im-provements in healthcare, education and transport services.' </p> <p>Brown then hinted at Labour's manifesto plans for the second term, where he will marry the pursuit of better public services with the Holy Grail of improved productivity in the economy. He drew parallels with the US during the Clinton years. In the first term there was big employment growth and little productivity growth. In Clinton's second term, this enlarged workforce became more productive. 'I think we are moving into that second phase in Britain, where we are managing to combine employment growth with productivity growth,' he said. </p> <p>Indeed the Chancellor dropped a heavy hint that he saw the strong pound as an unspoken pillar of promoting productivity growth in the economy. </p> <p>He said: 'Manufacturing has in my view responded very well to the challenge that's been presented by the weaker euro, and I think that the innovation that has taken place in manufacturing, despite all the difficulties, is something that is increasing productivity and yielding output gains as well.' But he refused to reply directly to the question of whether the pound was competitive at current rates. </p> <p>However, the Chancellor indicated that he thought other European countries were on his side about infrastructure spending being more important than a strict interpretation of the stability and growth pact which, technically, is in conflict with his own fiscal rules. </p> <p>Towards the end of our interview the Chancellor, who is in charge of the election campaign, waxed lyrical about the way New Labour's first term had prepared the groundwork for the second.

We're obviously prepared to be judged by the changes we've made so far, but I think our message to the British people is that there is a lot more to do, the work certainly goes on in rebuilding our public services, it goes on in trying to rebuild our productivity growth rate, and in trying to rebuild the employment potential of many communities which have suffered heavily over the past 20 or 30 years.' </p> <p>Brown promised 'imaginative ways' to tackle and abolish poverty among children and pensioners and 'more radical reforms' of the New Deal.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When John Quigley answered his phone last Wednesday morning he knew the news was bad. On the line was Brett Martin, corporate development director of the Merseyside-based shipbuilder Cammell Laird. Martin told Quigley, the AEEU union's shipbuilding national officer, that the company's shares had been suspended. There would be an announcement later in the day. </p> <p>Quigley, a laconic Scot, was uncharacteristically furious. But unlike his colleagues in the union's metals division, who publicly lambasted steelmaker Corus last month over its treatment of workers, his anger was not aimed at the company. </p> <p>Instead, as he briefed colleagues, the brunt of his criticism was reserved for US cruise giant Carnival, owner of the Italian shipping line Costa Crociere, which had terminated work on an extension for its vessel Costa Classica in November - after Cammell had spent \u00a340 million on it. </p> <p>Since then, Cammell's financial position and the future of its workers had been in jeopardy. The company's shares collapsed from more than \u00a31 in October to 6p on Thursday. </p> <p>Quigley was also frustrated with the Government. In October it had not awarded any of six valuable naval support vessels to Cammell - two went to Belfast's Harland &amp; Wolff and four to a German yard. Second, it had not provided a bankable package of support under EU rules to help Cammell win a $500m order for two cruise ships for another operator, Luxus. Quigley told The Observer: 'It is most unfortunate, because here was the first real chance to get British shipbuilding back into the profitable cruise market since the 1970s.' </p> <p>Cammell lost the naval contract before Costa pulled out. Many at the Birkenhead yard feel they were penalised for creating what, last autumn, seemed like a successful business. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the atmosphere at the company's Birkenhead and Tyneside yards as its 1,800 employees arrived on Wednesday was a mixture of business as usual - there are ship contracts worth \u00a340m under way - and deep anxiety. </p> <p>Ted Gilbertson, the AEEU's regional officer, heard the news on the morning TV. He said: 'People have continued to work, which is a great credit to them. But the question on everybody's minds is are we going to get paid next week? There is frustration and fear and anger because people fear the worst.' He blames the Costa fiasco, saying: 'There were two effects - the company was not paid, and it put its financial position and technical competence in question with other potential customers and with the DTI.' </p> <p>When it came, at just before 5pm, Wednesday's announcement was bad, but it did not spell immediate closure at Birkenhead or Tyneside. Instead receivers were called in. </p> <p>It could be the end of the line for a historic shipping name that has already had two lives. In its first incarnation, the company, founded in 1824, became one of the world's great shipbuilding names, making the Ark Royal aircraft carrier and Cunard liner Mauretania . But competition from the Far East in the 1980s undermined the competitiveness of UK shipbuilding, and Cammell followed other famous names into closure in 1993. </p> <p>It was rescued by John Stafford, an accountant and owner of ship repairer Coastline Industries, who refocused on higher-margin ship repair and conversion work. Profits rose and expansion followed, growing overseas operations, which now employ 1,700. Last autumn it still appeared healthy. </p> <p>Then came the Costa d\u00e9bcle. The Classica had sailed to Birkenhead from Genoa, but it was ordered home half way. Costa said it wanted arbitration because Cammell was overrunning its deadlines and there were technical problems. Cammell countered that independent reports said overruns could be made up, and that these and engineering problems were caused by Costa changing specifications. Jobs began to haemorrhage - some were laid off in the week before Christmas. </p> <p>Corporate development director Martin said: 'They say there were technical issues but you have to ask yourself why did they send the ship off and then try to renegotiate the contract while it was at sea? I think they acted in bad faith.' But Cammell's arguments came to nothing. In January, Costa confirmed it was not going ahead. </p> <p>The shipbuilder was still hopeful that the Luxus liners - contingent on a DTI aid package - would fill the gap. But negotiations with the DTI foundered. The uncontroversial part of the package was $40m of aid under the shipbuilding intervention fund. But there were problems with guarantees Luxus's bankers required and on a performance bond that the DTI required in return from Cammell. The DTI improved its offer but it was not enough. Meanwhile Stafford, the man who had rescued the business, resigned on 29 January. Martin said: 'I'm not bitter. Perhaps other governments would have tried harder.' </p> <p>Last month, Cammell, creaking under debt, called in investment banker Close Brothers to restructure the company. It was too late. The trigger was a deadline this Tuesday for a \u00a37.5m payment to bondholders, along with a \u00a310m payment on its overdraft. </p> <p>The bond payment was due on \u20ac125m (\u00a377m) of loan notes issued in November to help finance expansion from ship repair into big-time work like Costa and Luxus. </p> <p>Before the offering, Cammell had operated off a \u00a346m overdraft facility with Royal Bank of Scotland.

      "bodyText": "When John Quigley answered his phone last Wednesday morning he knew the news was bad. On the line was Brett Martin, corporate development director of the Merseyside-based shipbuilder Cammell Laird. Martin told Quigley, the AEEU union's shipbuilding national officer, that the company's shares had been suspended. There would be an announcement later in the day. Quigley, a laconic Scot, was uncharacteristically furious. But unlike his colleagues in the union's metals division, who publicly lambasted steelmaker Corus last month over its treatment of workers, his anger was not aimed at the company. Instead, as he briefed colleagues, the brunt of his criticism was reserved for US cruise giant Carnival, owner of the Italian shipping line Costa Crociere, which had terminated work on an extension for its vessel Costa Classica in November - after Cammell had spent \u00a340 million on it. Since then, Cammell's financial position and the future of its workers had been in jeopardy. The company's shares collapsed from more than \u00a31 in October to 6p on Thursday. Quigley was also frustrated with the Government. In October it had not awarded any of six valuable naval support vessels to Cammell - two went to Belfast's Harland &amp; Wolff and four to a German yard. Second, it had not provided a bankable package of support under EU rules to help Cammell win a $500m order for two cruise ships for another operator, Luxus. Quigley told The Observer: 'It is most unfortunate, because here was the first real chance to get British shipbuilding back into the profitable cruise market since the 1970s.' Cammell lost the naval contract before Costa pulled out. Many at the Birkenhead yard feel they were penalised for creating what, last autumn, seemed like a successful business. Meanwhile, the atmosphere at the company's Birkenhead and Tyneside yards as its 1,800 employees arrived on Wednesday was a mixture of business as usual - there are ship contracts worth \u00a340m under way - and deep anxiety. Ted Gilbertson, the AEEU's regional officer, heard the news on the morning TV. He said: 'People have continued to work, which is a great credit to them. But the question on everybody's minds is are we going to get paid next week? There is frustration and fear and anger because people fear the worst.' He blames the Costa fiasco, saying: 'There were two effects - the company was not paid, and it put its financial position and technical competence in question with other potential customers and with the DTI.' When it came, at just before 5pm, Wednesday's announcement was bad, but it did not spell immediate closure at Birkenhead or Tyneside. Instead receivers were called in. It could be the end of the line for a historic shipping name that has already had two lives. In its first incarnation, the company, founded in 1824, became one of the world's great shipbuilding names, making the Ark Royal aircraft carrier and Cunard liner Mauretania . But competition from the Far East in the 1980s undermined the competitiveness of UK shipbuilding, and Cammell followed other famous names into closure in 1993. It was rescued by John Stafford, an accountant and owner of ship repairer Coastline Industries, who refocused on higher-margin ship repair and conversion work. Profits rose and expansion followed, growing overseas operations, which now employ 1,700. Last autumn it still appeared healthy. Then came the Costa d\u00e9bcle. The Classica had sailed to Birkenhead from Genoa, but it was ordered home half way. Costa said it wanted arbitration because Cammell was overrunning its deadlines and there were technical problems. Cammell countered that independent reports said overruns could be made up, and that these and engineering problems were caused by Costa changing specifications. Jobs began to haemorrhage - some were laid off in the week before Christmas. Corporate development director Martin said: 'They say there were technical issues but you have to ask yourself why did they send the ship off and then try to renegotiate the contract while it was at sea? I think they acted in bad faith.' But Cammell's arguments came to nothing. In January, Costa confirmed it was not going ahead. The shipbuilder was still hopeful that the Luxus liners - contingent on a DTI aid package - would fill the gap. But negotiations with the DTI foundered. The uncontroversial part of the package was $40m of aid under the shipbuilding intervention fund. But there were problems with guarantees Luxus's bankers required and on a performance bond that the DTI required in return from Cammell. The DTI improved its offer but it was not enough. Meanwhile Stafford, the man who had rescued the business, resigned on 29 January. Martin said: 'I'm not bitter. Perhaps other governments would have tried harder.' Last month, Cammell, creaking under debt, called in investment banker Close Brothers to restructure the company. It was too late. The trigger was a deadline this Tuesday for a \u00a37.5m payment to bondholders, along with a \u00a310m payment on its overdraft. The bond payment was due on \u20ac125m (\u00a377m) of loan notes issued in November to help finance expansion from ship repair into big-time work like Costa and Luxus. Before the offering, Cammell had operated off a \u00a346m overdraft facility with Royal Bank of Scotland. RBS had extended this facility, on condition that payment from Costa came in on time. It did not. The financial markets have been expecting doom at Cammell. As bad news gathered pace, the value of the bonds followed the share price: this month they were trading at 16 per cent of face value, indicating the market expected a default. At the time of the bond issue, analysts were puzzled as to why management had not gone for a rights issue. One said it indicated they were nervous about the Classica contract, and felt this would have prejudiced a rights issue. Martin says simply that market conditions were not favourable. Encouragingly, ABN Amro's engineering analyst, Sandy Morris, says: 'This remains a very efficient ship-repair business. Problems started when it began to overstretch with these big contracts. There is still a viable business here.' Receivers are negotiating with customers, including the MoD, P&amp;O and Stena, over payment for work done on the ships currently on Cammell's books. They are also seeking a \u00a35m overdraft for the four to five weeks during which they are optimistic a sale can be agreed. Time may be running out, but the clock has not stopped yet for Cammell or its management. Alchemy eyes Cammell bid",

With the Schroder family holding 47 per cent of the shares, the National Association of Pension Funds is far less likely to win this battle than it ever was with the Scots at RBS. It gains full marks for trying, but after three defeats - Vodafone, RBS and Schroders this week - institutions ought to gang up and issue an ultimatum to any further boards helping themselves to a few million just for doing their job. Ironically the fat \u00a3800,000 'guaranteed bonus' due to new Marks &amp; Spencer chief executive Luc Vandevelde looks less galling. Given the scale of past losses, the big surprise at M&amp;S is that the hard decision to close its loss-making European stores was not taken much earlier. Takeovers, however, rarely add value for shareholders, unlike with organic growth (just look at what Brooks Brothers didn't do for M&amp;S). They happen mainly because of management ambition. The prospect of huge transaction-related bonuses distorts the rationale further. It is also a rule of the Takeover Code that any changes to directors' remuneration because of big deals has to be declared at the time. Maybe the Panel, too, might make its views known?",

It appears to be sending up the trendy metropolitan media world in which the unmarried thirtysomething Bridget works, the affluent, Home Counties, middle-class circle of her parents and their grotesque friends, and the insecure, man-chasing Bridget herself. But the filmmakers are uncritically in love with their heroine and her milieux and have romanticised them to an almost laughable degree. </p> <p>The office cad, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), Bridget's Mr Wrong, flirts with her by computer and seduces her, drives a Mercedes convertible and lives in a Thamesside apartment of breathtaking luxury. Her Mr Right, the strong, silent Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), is a celebrated civil rights lawyer of impeccable probity whose parents live in a country house that could give Castle Howard a run for its tourist dollar. The film's London is a clean, sparkling place out of a tourist brochure and the idyllic opening and closing Yuletide scenes in the snow are like Dickens at his most celebratory. </p> <p>As appealingly played by Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, the film's Bridget is doubly affected in that we have an American affecting a plausible British accent, but the Sloaney drawl she uses is itself an affectation. She is also inconsistent in her naivety. In the book, she knowingly talks of herself as a 'child of Cosmopolitan culture', yet doesn't know the sporting phrase 'throwing a match'. In the film, despite having a degree in English and working as a publicist for a smart publisher, she thinks F.R. Leavis is still alive and when being interviewed for a TV job professes to believe that El Ni\u00f1o is a Latin American dance. </p> <p>These are the things we laughed at in Monroe and Judy Holliday. They are also what appeal to both the sly suave Daniel, and the decent, kindly Darcy. In Daniel's case, they make her easier to seduce and cast aside; in Darcy's, they're the perfect attributes of the submissive, admiring partner he requires. </p> <p>The co-writers - Helen Fielding, Andrew Davies (in whose TV adaptation of Sense and Sensibility Colin Firth became a star) and Richard Curtis (author of Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill ) - have largely dropped the diary format after the opening few minutes, though the diary itself is used as a plot device in the swooningly romantic climax. </p> <p>We thus see Bridget more objectively than in the book, though whether this makes her narcissism and comic whingeing less tiresome is another matter. In both novel and film, we are clearly intended to find her not merely funny but also sympathetic, moving and exemplary of our age - as Owen might have said (Deborah Owen, the literary agent, that is, not Wilfred Owen), the poetry is in the self-pity. </p> <p>Of the film's three authors, Richard Curtis seems the dominant influence. What one might regard as his Hugh Grant Trilogy (Four Weddings, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones) resembles Howard Hawks's John Wayne Trilogy ( Rio Bravo, El Dorado and Rio Lobo) which, despite having different literary sources, are versions of the same story with similar characters and settings. 'I'm not a damn bit interested in whether somebody thinks this is a copy,' said Hawks, 'because the copy made more money than the original, and I was pleased with it.' </p> <p>So almost everything appears familiar, from the character who obsessively uses the word 'fuck' (as if laughter would flow exponentially from the repetition) through the climactic car chase to the calculatedly embarrassing scenes in which the heroes and heroines make idiots of themselves in public. </p> <p>The most excruciating of the latter comes when Bridget delivers a disastrous speech at a book launch attended by some leading figures in the London literary world, among them Salman Rushdie, who makes the most wincing personal appearance since Graham Hill congratulated Yves Montand on his success on the Monaco circuit in Grand Prix. This sequence should have been one of the film's best, because it could have enabled Sharon Maguire, making her feature debut here, to draw on her experience making documentaries. </p> <p>Another Curtis device, which may well have influenced Fielding's book, is to have the heroine surrounded by a devoted group of colourfully eccentric friends, one of them the gay confidant that's mandatory for every movie heroine nowadays. </p> <p>They're always there to bring her comfort and advice (and to help her with the wine and vodka), though if there were many such people at large in real life there would be queues a mile long at the admission gate of every Trappist monastery in Europe.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Boksic: golden goals </strong></p> <p>Middlesbrough's Alen Boksic is the only Britain-based player among the world's top 10 biggest-earning footballers. The survey, published in Spain last week, places the 31-year-old alongside Zinedine Zidane, Alessandro Del Piero, Luis Figo and Hernan Crespo, all of whom take home a nifty \u00a33million a year, or \u00a358,000 a week. Boro's cash has spread thickly: an Opta breakdown shows how Boksic has, so far, mopped up \u00a31,660 for every minute he's played, \u00a3272,727 for each of his 11 goals, and a cracking \u00a31.5m for each of his two (count them) goal assists. The 'crafty Croat' ( Mirror ) follows other big earning Boro tourists Juninho, Emerson, Ravanelli and Branca, who all wanted to play for a London club before seeing the terms on offer, and finishes behind only Alvaro Recoba (\u00a34.5m), Raul (\u00a33.6m), Rivaldo (\u00a33.57m) and Batistuta (\u00a33.45m) in the list. </p> <p> <strong> Brazilian nuts go public</strong> </p> <p>The Brazilian footballer arrested last week for stripping during a goal celebration is ready to sign up as a model for a gay magazine. The player, William Pereira Farias, tore off his shirt and shorts after scoring during a televised away game, then threw his shorts at the home side's fans before running away and being sent off. 'He broke the laws of respectful behaviour,' said police officer Alfredo Faria after the arrest. 'He offended the townspeople and will be suspended.' Pereira was charged with indecent exposure - a possible six-month sentence - and locked out of his house by his girlfriend. 'I thought I was going to have to sleep in the street,' he told reporters. 'It wasn't easy to make her let me in.' Now he's set to give up football for gay modelling. 'I've hardly earned anything from football, and my salary is a joke,' he revealed. 'I'm thinking carefully about the offer.' </p> <p><strong> Spurs fury fatigue: fans washed up </strong> </p> <p>After 19 months of Tottenham pressure groups, chants of 'We want our Tottenham back', fury against Alan Sugar for only spending \u00a311m on a striker, abuse hurled at George Graham, the players and each other, Spurs fans responded magnificently to the return of King Glenda against Bradford on Wednesday. 28,306 turned up - 6,700 down on the season's average, 7,300 down on the last home game v Coventry, and 7,800 down on Hod's 0-0 visit to the Lane with his Southampton side in January. </p> <p> <strong>Press release of the week</strong> </p> <p> 'Alan Shearer To Make Debut As Metro Radio's New Signing!' </p> <p>Newcastle's captain, premature pensioner and all-time least interesting person this side of Howard Wilkinson, makes his radio co-commentary debut tomorrow for Tyneside's Metro Radio. Shearer, out for the season with tendinitis, agreed to the move to the delight of radio execs, who reckon 'thousands of loyal Geordie fans' will be thrilled by the news. 'If we can't have Alan out scoring goals for us on the pitch, then we felt that the next best thing would be to get some of his expert insights live on air during the game. It's a real coup for us.' Shearer thinks so too - and if the press release is anything to go by, listeners are in for a feast: 'Alan added jokingly, \"I'll be warning the lads all week that if they don't perform on Monday afternoon I'll be live on air to give them some serious stick!!\".' Great!! </p> <p><strong> French: peace is for wimps </strong> </p> <p>'Fair Play Day', staged in the French first division last week, collapsed in farce after 42 players were booked and two sent off. The cards made it the second most ill-disciplined weekend of the season, despite players wearing shirts saying 'Peace and foot' - short for football - and captains reading out messages of fair play. Refs also awarded six penalties: second only to a completely brutal week in December which saw 44 yellows and two reds. </p> <p> Quote of the week </p> <p> <strong> Big-thinker Ade Akinbiyi, in the Wolverhampton Express and Star </strong> </p> <p>'I was watching the Blackburn game on TV on Sunday when it flashed on the screen that George Ndah had scored in the first minute at Birmingham. My first reaction was to ring him up. Then I remembered he was out there playing, so I rang his brother instead.'</p> <p><strong> Said &amp; Done: </strong> david.hills@observer.co.uk</p>",

The 'crafty Croat' ( Mirror ) follows other big earning Boro tourists Juninho, Emerson, Ravanelli and Branca, who all wanted to play for a London club before seeing the terms on offer, and finishes behind only Alvaro Recoba (\u00a34.5m), Raul (\u00a33.6m), Rivaldo (\u00a33.57m) and Batistuta (\u00a33.45m) in the list. Brazilian nuts go public The Brazilian footballer arrested last week for stripping during a goal celebration is ready to sign up as a model for a gay magazine. The player, William Pereira Farias, tore off his shirt and shorts after scoring during a televised away game, then threw his shorts at the home side's fans before running away and being sent off. 'He broke the laws of respectful behaviour,' said police officer Alfredo Faria after the arrest. 'He offended the townspeople and will be suspended.' Pereira was charged with indecent exposure - a possible six-month sentence - and locked out of his house by his girlfriend. 'I thought I was going to have to sleep in the street,' he told reporters. 'It wasn't easy to make her let me in.' Now he's set to give up football for gay modelling. 'I've hardly earned anything from football, and my salary is a joke,' he revealed. 'I'm thinking carefully about the offer.' Spurs fury fatigue: fans washed up After 19 months of Tottenham pressure groups, chants of 'We want our Tottenham back', fury against Alan Sugar for only spending \u00a311m on a striker, abuse hurled at George Graham, the players and each other, Spurs fans responded magnificently to the return of King Glenda against Bradford on Wednesday. 28,306 turned up - 6,700 down on the season's average, 7,300 down on the last home game v Coventry, and 7,800 down on Hod's 0-0 visit to the Lane with his Southampton side in January. Press release of the week 'Alan Shearer To Make Debut As Metro Radio's New Signing!' Newcastle's captain, premature pensioner and all-time least interesting person this side of Howard Wilkinson, makes his radio co-commentary debut tomorrow for Tyneside's Metro Radio. Shearer, out for the season with tendinitis, agreed to the move to the delight of radio execs, who reckon 'thousands of loyal Geordie fans' will be thrilled by the news. 'If we can't have Alan out scoring goals for us on the pitch, then we felt that the next best thing would be to get some of his expert insights live on air during the game. It's a real coup for us.' Shearer thinks so too - and if the press release is anything to go by, listeners are in for a feast: 'Alan added jokingly, \"I'll be warning the lads all week that if they don't perform on Monday afternoon I'll be live on air to give them some serious stick!!\".' Great!! French: peace is for wimps 'Fair Play Day', staged in the French first division last week, collapsed in farce after 42 players were booked and two sent off. The cards made it the second most ill-disciplined weekend of the season, despite players wearing shirts saying 'Peace and foot' - short for football - and captains reading out messages of fair play. Refs also awarded six penalties: second only to a completely brutal week in December which saw 44 yellows and two reds. Quote of the week Big-thinker Ade Akinbiyi, in the Wolverhampton Express and Star 'I was watching the Blackburn game on TV on Sunday when it flashed on the screen that George Ndah had scored in the first minute at Birmingham. My first reaction was to ring him up. Then I remembered he was out there playing, so I rang his brother instead.' Said &amp; Done: david.hills@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>It was either a stroke of genius or outrageous good fortune, but Paulo Wanchope gave Manchester City something to hold on to with a winning goal that would figure prominently even in his video of memorable moments. </p> <p>The Costa Rican kept his side in with at least a mathematical chance of avoiding the drop into Division One when he backheeled the ball into the net from eight yards midway through the second half after apparently losing control of Mark Kennedy's cross. </p> <p>It could prove to be the most significant backheeled City goal since a similar effort from Denis Law relegated Manchester United in 1974. And coming, as it did, after Shaun Goater's fortuitous first-half goal, the Blues' fans left here hoping perhaps their luck has finally turned for the better, even if Middlesbrough's victory meant they gained little ground. But after a run of only two wins in their previous 22 matches, any hope is to be clung to. </p> <p>These were two teams in crisis, although the term is a relative one in Leicester's case as their fans' dissatisfaction stemmed only from their team's decline from top in October to tenth. </p> <p>The return of Tim Flowers in goal, for the first time since New Year's Day, and Robbie Savage, only 17 days after a cartilage operation, fortified Leicester but didn't lead to any change of luck, with the visitors taking the lead in the 17th minute in truly bizarre fashion. </p> <p>Wanchope's header from Kennedy's cross appeared set to come to nothing when it bounced in front of Flowers, who shaped to punch it away only to see his right-fist jab hit Goater on the back of the cranium and end up in the net. Probably the last person in the ground to know what had happened was the goalscorer. </p> <p>The lead lasted 24 minutes until Ade Akinbiyi once more showed how deadly he can be from a yard when he scrambled Steve Guppy's low cross past the keeper Carlo Nash at the near post. </p> <p>News of Middlesbrough's first-half performance at Arsenal sent ripples of disbelief through the away fans. To help lift their spirits the public address announcer played the theme from The Great Escape when the teams came out for the second period. </p> <p>Gerry Taggart nearly gave Manchester City a helping hand in the 65th minute when he headed Andrei Kanchelskis's cross on to his own bar before Wanchope's winning intervention.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was either a stroke of genius or outrageous good fortune, but Paulo Wanchope gave Manchester City something to hold on to with a winning goal that would figure prominently even in his video of memorable moments. The Costa Rican kept his side in with at least a mathematical chance of avoiding the drop into Division One when he backheeled the ball into the net from eight yards midway through the second half after apparently losing control of Mark Kennedy's cross. It could prove to be the most significant backheeled City goal since a similar effort from Denis Law relegated Manchester United in 1974. And coming, as it did, after Shaun Goater's fortuitous first-half goal, the Blues' fans left here hoping perhaps their luck has finally turned for the better, even if Middlesbrough's victory meant they gained little ground. But after a run of only two wins in their previous 22 matches, any hope is to be clung to. These were two teams in crisis, although the term is a relative one in Leicester's case as their fans' dissatisfaction stemmed only from their team's decline from top in October to tenth. The return of Tim Flowers in goal, for the first time since New Year's Day, and Robbie Savage, only 17 days after a cartilage operation, fortified Leicester but didn't lead to any change of luck, with the visitors taking the lead in the 17th minute in truly bizarre fashion. Wanchope's header from Kennedy's cross appeared set to come to nothing when it bounced in front of Flowers, who shaped to punch it away only to see his right-fist jab hit Goater on the back of the cranium and end up in the net. Probably the last person in the ground to know what had happened was the goalscorer. The lead lasted 24 minutes until Ade Akinbiyi once more showed how deadly he can be from a yard when he scrambled Steve Guppy's low cross past the keeper Carlo Nash at the near post. News of Middlesbrough's first-half performance at Arsenal sent ripples of disbelief through the away fans. To help lift their spirits the public address announcer played the theme from The Great Escape when the teams came out for the second period. Gerry Taggart nearly gave Manchester City a helping hand in the 65th minute when he headed Andrei Kanchelskis's cross on to his own bar before Wanchope's winning intervention.",

The bombers who planted a device outside a Post Office delivery depot were labelled \"totally reckless\" on Sunday, as fears grew that a renewed mainland terror campaign would escalate. The device, packed with up to 1lb of high explosives, blew out windows, exploding \"without any notice whatsoever,\" said deputy assistant commissioner Alan Fry, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch. This explosion comes six weeks after a bomb blast hit the BBC TV Centre in London. At the time Mr Fry said he feared it was the escalation of a Real IRA terror campaign on mainland Britain. \"We have been predicting, since Christmas, that the mainland, and London in particular, would be subject to terrorist attacks,\" he said. Saturday's device exploded at 11.28pm and was a similar size to the device at Hammersmith Bridge in June last year. It blew out the glass from the windows of the depot, but nobody was inside and there were no reports of injuries. But it was designed to maim or injure, and falling glass from the blast could have caused horrendous injuries or even killed. \"Whoever put that device down was totally reckless as to someone living in the area, drinking in the pub just beyond this device, walking past at the time of the explosion or in a vehicle, could have had a serious accident,\" he said. Lab tests will confirm if the bomb was the work of the Real IRA, he added. \"Due to the number of recent attacks and the nature of this one, I suspect that this is the work of the Real IRA,\" Mr Fry said. No claim of responsibility had been made by Sunday night. A forensic fingertip search of the site was carried out and the focus of the investigation switched to laboratory work to establish the type of explosive and device used. It was still unclear why the bombers targeted the depot at The Hyde, Hendon, which suffered minor damage in the blast. \"I don't know of a significance other than being a Post Office premises. That will fit in with the Easter Uprising, which of course is being celebrated, the anniversary of that event is this weekend,\" Mr Fry said. \"There are a number of other features that might fit in. There's the Good Friday Agreement and where the peace process is, and equally there was the film of Michael Collins on the television last night. \"Whether any of these events featured in the planning, in the reasons behind this explosion, I don't know, but clearly they are all lines of inquiry and all possibilities.\" The BBC bomb blast is also thought to be the work of the Real IRA and it detonated inside a taxi as bomb disposal experts attempted to carry out a controlled explosion. One London Underground worker suffered minor injuries in the attack. Before the blast at the BBC premises in Wood Lane, Shepherd's Bush, coded warnings had been received. From the police cordon around 100 yards away, two smashed windows could be seen and metal railings lining the road outside the depot were twisted, apparently by the force of the blast. Gerry Madden, delivery officer manager at the postal sorting office, said 80 people work at the depot but no one was on duty on Saturday night. He said: \"Half-a-dozen windows were broken, nothing at all inside. Everything inside is perfect apart from a few scorch marks on the wall. \"No staff were due to be here until Monday night when everything will carry on as normal.\" Stephen Cunliffe, manager of the Glen pub, just 50 yards from the sorting office, said the pub hosted a late disco on Saturday night and it was still busy at 11.30pm when the explosion happened. He said: \"I could hardly hear the explosion because of the music. Police evacuated us at 11.45pm. I'm concerned that this could have happened, but I'm glad that no one was injured. It was just a stroke of luck.\" Mr Fry said it was of the \"utmost importance\" those responsible were found and brought to justice. The depot is near the busy Edgware Road, which reopened following the police search, and he appealed to anyone who had seen \"strange incidents\" in the area to come forward. The post office building is expected to open on Tuesday morning after the Bank Holiday. Anyone with information about the blast is asked to contact the confidential Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789 321.",

      "body": "<p>It was 50 years ago this week that Eric Morley came up with the idea for Miss World, as a one-off publicity stunt to promote the Festival of Britain. He died last November, aged 82, but his widow, Julia Morley, is still full of energy. 'I've been rushing around trying to get the company back on its feet again,' she says. 'We have developed a new concept for the show and we're discussing ways we can do something pretty positive towards the contestants' education, with scholarships.' </p> <p>Now head of the Miss World organisation, Mrs Morley is planning 'a huge operation on the web'. She has just sold satellite television rights around the world with projected viewing figures of more than two billion and is devising an international lifestyle magazine. She airs the possibility of a 'global network that nobody else has got, except CNN. It's a lot of talking, I know,' she says, pausing for a moment. 'But I do know it's going to happen. It's just that I've... I've got the reins now and it's a funny feeling being able to go down the roads that I've always dreamt of.' </p> <p>It may come as a surprise to hear that the woman who married Eric Morley in 1960, and who has been heavily involved with the Miss World contest since 1969, should have harboured such dreams to change it. For years, Julia Morley has been the 'mother hen' figure who protected the girls from the eagle eye of the press, who made sure they were being chaperoned, who, while her husband was announcing the results 'in reverse order', operated backstage with military precision. She is a former model, and a self-professed 'tough bitch'. And yet, despite having been number two in charge of a competition long accused of being a sexist 'cattle market', Julia Morley has always supported women behind the scenes. She coined the phrase 'beauty with a purpose'; she banned the revelation of the contestants' vital statistics; and when the tabloids splashed a reported affair over their front pages, she spoke up for women everywhere, saying: 'I figure that a woman, like a man, is entitled to have a private life and to be respected.' </p> <p>Now Julia Morley tells me that although she had 'enormous respect' for her husband's wisdom, their aims did differ. 'It did seem very unnatural to me as a woman,' she says, 'that girls should turn, turn, turn on the stage, for a start. And I didn't feel comfortable with swimsuits on stage. Not because I thought there was anything wrong with them, but I thought that you don't generally feel comfortable if someone's interviewing you in a dinner jacket and you're in a swimsuit. I thought it was pretty awful to see women standing there with practically nothing on, with old Aspel saying, \"what did you eat for breakfast?\" - it was so stupid. But you can't change things overnight.' Now however, Julia Morley has stepped out from behind the clich\u00e9d fa\u00e7ade of glitter and bikinis, and, for the first time ever, Miss World is in the hands of a woman. </p> <p>Miss World was very much of its time when it was invented; very much the brainchild of one man, and coloured by his background. Eric Morley was born the year the First World War ended. His father died when he was a baby, and his mother and stepfather both died of TB when he was 11. The young orphan was sent by the London County Council to a Royal Naval training ship, and five years later he became a band boy in the Royal Fusiliers, playing the French horn. During the war he was a captain in the Army: he organised entertainments for the troops, and made money by chopping a bar of toffee into 40 squares and selling them individually. By the time he was demobilised Eric Morley was an entertainer, an entrepreneur, and a patriot through and through. </p> <p>He joined the leisure organisation Mecca in 1946 as publicity sales manager, and in the next few years he was responsible for three of the most popular entertainments of the postwar period. Come Dancing, the BBC's longest running programme, was his idea; he introduced commercial bingo to the UK; and in 1951, when asked to come up with something to publicise the Festival of Britain, he suggested a pageant of 'international bathing beauties'. There were 23 girls in that first contest, which was to develop as its theme tune a sort of patriotic march. The prize money was \u00a31,000, and the bikinis, in a pre-page 3 girl era, caused a storm. A year later, an American organisation started up Miss Universe, and Morley, seeing this as a kind of galactic one-upmanship, was not to be outdone. He vowed to continue Miss World so the Americans could never say they got there first. </p> <p>Morley met Julia Pritchard, who had trained as a nurse and worked as a model, in one of Mecca's dance halls, and they married soon afterwards. By 1975 he was running 100 dance halls and 700 betting shops. A firm Thatcherite, Morley stood as Tory candidate for Dulwich twice in the Seventies and lost both times. When he died of a heart attack last year, 20 former Miss Worlds attended his funeral. </p> <p>Although the contest is now often thought to be something of an anachronism, it is, when looked at over the years, the opposite. If anything, Miss World reflects the times rather than contradicting them. It started as a postwar entertainment, something to televise when that medium was new; it went on to offer a life of unimaginable glamour to girls who, in the Sixties, had few opportunities in the way of a career; in the Seventies it was attacked by the women's movement, and tarnished, or enlivened, by sexual scandal; in the Eighties it was thought to be bland and unpopular and was taken off terrestrial television; in the Nineties it found a new home in India, where the arguments of the Seventies feminists were reborn: a group of women threatened mass suicide, and one man burnt himself to death in protest; in 2000, two weeks after its creator died, the contest was hosted by Jerry Springer in the Millennium Dome, making it, by association, a symbol of chaos and doom. </p> <p>The women who have won Miss World did so because they were thought to reflect a certain type of womanhood, in a certain era. But their lives did not stop there; they've become other kinds of women too, with new perspectives. Their memories, and those of other women involved, offer a perhaps unique view of the changes wrought over the last half century. </p> <p>Denise Perrier, who is now 66 and lives in Nice, was the third Miss World. She won the contest in 1953, when she was 18, and had just come out of boarding school. 'I spent a very pleasant week with the other Misses,' she remembers, 'but there were very few of us then - you know, the \"world\" was much smaller! No one from African or Asian countries was represented.' </p> <p>Perrier thought she wanted to be an archaeologist before she fell into the beauty pageant circuit on holiday in Eastbourne. But once she had won Miss World, she was launched into a career as a model. 'I was in Diamonds Are Forever,' she says, adding as a self-dismissive parenthesis: 'Sean Connery strangles me at the beginning'. </p> <p>She went on to organise fashion shows in the South of France, stopping briefly to sell her own paintings to King Farouk and the Aga Khan, and, in the Eighties, she also worked for the local council in Nice, arranging art exhibitions and exchanges between museums. Perrier retired last year. 'I had a career,' she reflects, 'and on some level, I regret not doing more for my son. I don't know. People more intelligent than me have written about this, but women's lives have changed totally since then. When I was at school, the children whose mothers worked were seen as supernatural beings. It was unimaginable. I don't want to sound like I'm behind the times but I can only conclude that our home lives were more relaxed then.' </p> <p>Ann Sidney won Miss World 37 years ago. 'Isn't that scary?' she asks me, 'I mean, how we've changed, thank goodness.' For her, the Miss World contest was a ticket out of Poole in Dorset and away from her parents' expectations. She now lives in Los Angeles, and has spent the intervening years as an actress, a dancer and a singer. 'It sounds daft to make an analogy with boxing, about people getting out of their environment or escaping what their destiny was,' Sidney says, 'but to a certain degree, Miss World was something that enabled me financially to go and do something else, instead of saying that my destiny was to not get any further education, to marry, to have children, and stay within the same society that was expected of me. I'm not blaming my parents - it's just how we were then. Now we have many more choices.' </p> <p>She was born in 1944, towards the end of the war. Her father was ill for a long time afterwards, and she remembers her mother having rationing. 'I had a good upbringing, but it was a very simple upbringing,' Sidney recalls. 'Very working class - my mother was a waitress, and my father worked for a wholesale meat company. So for me, at 19, to win the Miss World was a phenomenal experience, and a big, big change'. She didn't think for a moment that she'd win, and was due to start work as a hairdresser in John Lewis the week after. </p> <p>'I would love to have got a further education at that point,' Sidney says, 'but I feel that in lots of ways the Miss World was a tremendous education for me. I was extremely naive, in fact I think I'd only been to the Isle of Wight. When I won the Miss World contest, I found myself on the Bob Hope show, flying to Vietnam. My first trip was to LA, and I was picked up in the limousine that the Beatles had used - there were kids still screaming and chasing the limousine. And it wasn't just showbusiness: in Vietnam we would see 18 year-old men with their legs blown off. You saw what war could do to people.' </p> <p>Though Miss World became her education, Ann Sidney says she wouldn't do it if she were 19 now: 'We've changed - women have changed, everything's changed. And change is good.' </p> <p>In 1965 Sidney handed over her crown to Lesley Langley, a perfect peroxide blonde, with hair that flicked up at the ends. 'You get used to people looking at you,' Langley remembers now, 'It was part of my life then, because I was a model anyway. I was in it for the money, I guess. It was another job to me. I loved it. But I like my life now, too.' </p> <p>Langley now works part-time as a receptionist in a private dental surgery in Weymouth. During her year as Miss World she met Alan Haven, a jazz musician who became her husband. She learnt latin percussion, and toured with him, so the end of her tenure wasn't a shock. Many others found that being a beauty queen qualified them for very little, and that their year of first-class travel was suddenly up. After a while, Langley says, 'if you're relying on your looks, it was too much for me, I didn't want to know any more'. The couple had a daughter, Chloe. They split up when Chloe was eight, and Langley moved back to Weymouth, so she could be near her elderly parents and bring Chloe up on her own. </p> <p>Now Chloe has finished university and had gone travelling. 'I loved it when she was at university,' Langley says, 'I'd go and visit, and we'd all go out. When I went to take Chloe up to Worcester the first time, I thought, oh I could have liked this, university life. I should have carried on and gone to university really.' </p> <p>She remembers that in those days 'there just weren't as many options. And maybe we relied on our looks more. But now there are the supermodels - there have always been glamorous women cashing in on their looks. I suppose if you've got it, you've got to use it a bit in this world today - and people do, everybody does.' </p> <p>'After my time, the women's lib people took it all so seriously,' Langley tells me. 'I used to go on various chat shows and debate the point, but really it comes down to just frivolous entertainment. Nobody makes the girls do it. To me, these contests are just entertainment.' </p> <p>In 1970, history was made at the Royal Albert Hall. While Bob Hope was busy making sexist jokes on stage ('it's been quite a cattle market - I've been out there checking calves') a group of Women's Liberation demonstrators prepared for action. A football rattle resounded through the hall, loud and untraceable. Hope, now halfway through a sentence, looked up from his mike, suddenly startled. On the live telecast of the event, you can see him in close-up, his mouth half-open, pausing and scanning the auditorium for the culprit. At that moment, from behind him comes a bursting balloon of flour. He turns around, like a rabbit in headlights, and runs for the wings. </p> <p>There were stink bombs and tomatoes thrown too, though they are invisible in the grainy images of the archives. In fact, the physical sabotage looks rather low-scale, but as a piece of activism it was a triumph. Hope returned to the stage, flustered and stricken, and gave an impromptu speech in impeccably bad taste, about dope and Vietnam; he was condemned more by his own words than by any flour bomb. </p> <p>Sally Alexander, now a historian at Goldmith's College London, was one of the demonstrators. She was arrested that night; later she was tried for assault and found not guilty. 'Our targets were the people who ran Miss World,' Alexander explains, 'and Bob Hope, because he'd been to Vietnam, and we wanted the media to be aware of the Women's Liberation Movement. The object of our anger and our frustration was, as we saw it, a system that left women with no other economic opportunities, except cleaning, or low-paid jobs at the very bottom of the wage hierarchy. So we decided to make a spectacle out of the event.' </p> <p>But, contrary to what might be supposed, they were not against the girls participating in Miss World. 'The demonstration was not against the contestants at all,' says Alexander, 'that's an important point. For the young women who wanted to enter a Miss World contest, it was a way out, it was exciting, it was fun - that was their choice. It was Mecca's activities we were opposed to. As we were arrested and dragged out, we bumped into the contestants, most of whom were very nice to us, and said, \"let them alone, they're only having their say\" - that kind of stuff.' </p> <p>More than 30 years after the event, Julia Morley, who had been standing backstage on that occasion, gripping Bob Hope's ankle so he wouldn't run away, tells me that no one has ever asked her opinion about it before. 'I had a lot of sympathy for women's lib,' she says now. 'The only thing that I found very difficult was that they didn't actually come to see me or talk to me. At the time, I was actually very much involved, and trying really hard to change things, but it takes time.' </p> <p>The 1970 demonstration did not have an immediate effect on Miss World, in the sense that the contest continues to this day. But the spectacle was symbolic of less visible work done for women's lives behind the scenes. And over time, the effects of that work have reverberated even on Miss World. Whether or not the contest is politically correct is not the crucial issue now: what is important is that it is not needed the way it was, that women have other options, and that wearing a bikini for a man's inspection is no longer seen as the road to freedom. </p> <p>Last year, two weeks after the fiftieth Miss World was crowned, Rosemarie Frankland, Miss World 1961 and the first Miss UK to win the title, committed suicide. She had told a newspaper not long beforehand that 'beauty queens are dressed up and paraded down the catwalk just so some fellow can get a quick thrill. They should shove it in the archives and forget about it.' </p> <p>Instead, Julia Morley is trying to resurrect it. The Miss World Organisation suggested that I speak to Diana Hayden, Miss World 1997. Hayden is one of the four Miss Indias who have won Miss World in the past seven years. She clearly represents the new model, since, as she tells me, 'they've been up on stage saying I'm the best Miss World they've ever had'. Hayden still does a lot of work for charity, and is now an international spokesperson for L'Or\u00e9al. She is having her hair done at the Dorchester hotel when we speak. </p> <p>I ask Hayden what she thinks of the demonstrations that took place in her home country the year before she won. 'They threatened to burn themselves,' she says, 'and nothing came of it, because they were just threats.' One man did burn himself to death, I tell her. 'Did he really?' Hayden asks.

      "bodyText": "It was 50 years ago this week that Eric Morley came up with the idea for Miss World, as a one-off publicity stunt to promote the Festival of Britain. He died last November, aged 82, but his widow, Julia Morley, is still full of energy. 'I've been rushing around trying to get the company back on its feet again,' she says. 'We have developed a new concept for the show and we're discussing ways we can do something pretty positive towards the contestants' education, with scholarships.' Now head of the Miss World organisation, Mrs Morley is planning 'a huge operation on the web'. She has just sold satellite television rights around the world with projected viewing figures of more than two billion and is devising an international lifestyle magazine. She airs the possibility of a 'global network that nobody else has got, except CNN. It's a lot of talking, I know,' she says, pausing for a moment. 'But I do know it's going to happen. It's just that I've... I've got the reins now and it's a funny feeling being able to go down the roads that I've always dreamt of.' It may come as a surprise to hear that the woman who married Eric Morley in 1960, and who has been heavily involved with the Miss World contest since 1969, should have harboured such dreams to change it. For years, Julia Morley has been the 'mother hen' figure who protected the girls from the eagle eye of the press, who made sure they were being chaperoned, who, while her husband was announcing the results 'in reverse order', operated backstage with military precision. She is a former model, and a self-professed 'tough bitch'. And yet, despite having been number two in charge of a competition long accused of being a sexist 'cattle market', Julia Morley has always supported women behind the scenes. She coined the phrase 'beauty with a purpose'; she banned the revelation of the contestants' vital statistics; and when the tabloids splashed a reported affair over their front pages, she spoke up for women everywhere, saying: 'I figure that a woman, like a man, is entitled to have a private life and to be respected.' Now Julia Morley tells me that although she had 'enormous respect' for her husband's wisdom, their aims did differ. 'It did seem very unnatural to me as a woman,' she says, 'that girls should turn, turn, turn on the stage, for a start. And I didn't feel comfortable with swimsuits on stage. Not because I thought there was anything wrong with them, but I thought that you don't generally feel comfortable if someone's interviewing you in a dinner jacket and you're in a swimsuit. I thought it was pretty awful to see women standing there with practically nothing on, with old Aspel saying, \"what did you eat for breakfast?\" - it was so stupid. But you can't change things overnight.' Now however, Julia Morley has stepped out from behind the clich\u00e9d fa\u00e7ade of glitter and bikinis, and, for the first time ever, Miss World is in the hands of a woman. Miss World was very much of its time when it was invented; very much the brainchild of one man, and coloured by his background. Eric Morley was born the year the First World War ended. His father died when he was a baby, and his mother and stepfather both died of TB when he was 11. The young orphan was sent by the London County Council to a Royal Naval training ship, and five years later he became a band boy in the Royal Fusiliers, playing the French horn. During the war he was a captain in the Army: he organised entertainments for the troops, and made money by chopping a bar of toffee into 40 squares and selling them individually. By the time he was demobilised Eric Morley was an entertainer, an entrepreneur, and a patriot through and through. He joined the leisure organisation Mecca in 1946 as publicity sales manager, and in the next few years he was responsible for three of the most popular entertainments of the postwar period. Come Dancing, the BBC's longest running programme, was his idea; he introduced commercial bingo to the UK; and in 1951, when asked to come up with something to publicise the Festival of Britain, he suggested a pageant of 'international bathing beauties'. There were 23 girls in that first contest, which was to develop as its theme tune a sort of patriotic march. The prize money was \u00a31,000, and the bikinis, in a pre-page 3 girl era, caused a storm. A year later, an American organisation started up Miss Universe, and Morley, seeing this as a kind of galactic one-upmanship, was not to be outdone. He vowed to continue Miss World so the Americans could never say they got there first. Morley met Julia Pritchard, who had trained as a nurse and worked as a model, in one of Mecca's dance halls, and they married soon afterwards. By 1975 he was running 100 dance halls and 700 betting shops. A firm Thatcherite, Morley stood as Tory candidate for Dulwich twice in the Seventies and lost both times. When he died of a heart attack last year, 20 former Miss Worlds attended his funeral. Although the contest is now often thought to be something of an anachronism, it is, when looked at over the years, the opposite. If anything, Miss World reflects the times rather than contradicting them. It started as a postwar entertainment, something to televise when that medium was new; it went on to offer a life of unimaginable glamour to girls who, in the Sixties, had few opportunities in the way of a career; in the Seventies it was attacked by the women's movement, and tarnished, or enlivened, by sexual scandal; in the Eighties it was thought to be bland and unpopular and was taken off terrestrial television; in the Nineties it found a new home in India, where the arguments of the Seventies feminists were reborn: a group of women threatened mass suicide, and one man burnt himself to death in protest; in 2000, two weeks after its creator died, the contest was hosted by Jerry Springer in the Millennium Dome, making it, by association, a symbol of chaos and doom. The women who have won Miss World did so because they were thought to reflect a certain type of womanhood, in a certain era. But their lives did not stop there; they've become other kinds of women too, with new perspectives. Their memories, and those of other women involved, offer a perhaps unique view of the changes wrought over the last half century. Denise Perrier, who is now 66 and lives in Nice, was the third Miss World. She won the contest in 1953, when she was 18, and had just come out of boarding school. 'I spent a very pleasant week with the other Misses,' she remembers, 'but there were very few of us then - you know, the \"world\" was much smaller! No one from African or Asian countries was represented.' Perrier thought she wanted to be an archaeologist before she fell into the beauty pageant circuit on holiday in Eastbourne. But once she had won Miss World, she was launched into a career as a model. 'I was in Diamonds Are Forever,' she says, adding as a self-dismissive parenthesis: 'Sean Connery strangles me at the beginning'. She went on to organise fashion shows in the South of France, stopping briefly to sell her own paintings to King Farouk and the Aga Khan, and, in the Eighties, she also worked for the local council in Nice, arranging art exhibitions and exchanges between museums. Perrier retired last year. 'I had a career,' she reflects, 'and on some level, I regret not doing more for my son. I don't know. People more intelligent than me have written about this, but women's lives have changed totally since then. When I was at school, the children whose mothers worked were seen as supernatural beings. It was unimaginable. I don't want to sound like I'm behind the times but I can only conclude that our home lives were more relaxed then.' Ann Sidney won Miss World 37 years ago. 'Isn't that scary?' she asks me, 'I mean, how we've changed, thank goodness.' For her, the Miss World contest was a ticket out of Poole in Dorset and away from her parents' expectations. She now lives in Los Angeles, and has spent the intervening years as an actress, a dancer and a singer. 'It sounds daft to make an analogy with boxing, about people getting out of their environment or escaping what their destiny was,' Sidney says, 'but to a certain degree, Miss World was something that enabled me financially to go and do something else, instead of saying that my destiny was to not get any further education, to marry, to have children, and stay within the same society that was expected of me. I'm not blaming my parents - it's just how we were then. Now we have many more choices.' She was born in 1944, towards the end of the war. Her father was ill for a long time afterwards, and she remembers her mother having rationing. 'I had a good upbringing, but it was a very simple upbringing,' Sidney recalls. 'Very working class - my mother was a waitress, and my father worked for a wholesale meat company. So for me, at 19, to win the Miss World was a phenomenal experience, and a big, big change'. She didn't think for a moment that she'd win, and was due to start work as a hairdresser in John Lewis the week after. 'I would love to have got a further education at that point,' Sidney says, 'but I feel that in lots of ways the Miss World was a tremendous education for me. I was extremely naive, in fact I think I'd only been to the Isle of Wight. When I won the Miss World contest, I found myself on the Bob Hope show, flying to Vietnam. My first trip was to LA, and I was picked up in the limousine that the Beatles had used - there were kids still screaming and chasing the limousine. And it wasn't just showbusiness: in Vietnam we would see 18 year-old men with their legs blown off. You saw what war could do to people.' Though Miss World became her education, Ann Sidney says she wouldn't do it if she were 19 now: 'We've changed - women have changed, everything's changed. And change is good.' In 1965 Sidney handed over her crown to Lesley Langley, a perfect peroxide blonde, with hair that flicked up at the ends. 'You get used to people looking at you,' Langley remembers now, 'It was part of my life then, because I was a model anyway. I was in it for the money, I guess. It was another job to me. I loved it. But I like my life now, too.' Langley now works part-time as a receptionist in a private dental surgery in Weymouth. During her year as Miss World she met Alan Haven, a jazz musician who became her husband. She learnt latin percussion, and toured with him, so the end of her tenure wasn't a shock. Many others found that being a beauty queen qualified them for very little, and that their year of first-class travel was suddenly up. After a while, Langley says, 'if you're relying on your looks, it was too much for me, I didn't want to know any more'. The couple had a daughter, Chloe. They split up when Chloe was eight, and Langley moved back to Weymouth, so she could be near her elderly parents and bring Chloe up on her own. Now Chloe has finished university and had gone travelling. 'I loved it when she was at university,' Langley says, 'I'd go and visit, and we'd all go out. When I went to take Chloe up to Worcester the first time, I thought, oh I could have liked this, university life. I should have carried on and gone to university really.' She remembers that in those days 'there just weren't as many options. And maybe we relied on our looks more. But now there are the supermodels - there have always been glamorous women cashing in on their looks. I suppose if you've got it, you've got to use it a bit in this world today - and people do, everybody does.' 'After my time, the women's lib people took it all so seriously,' Langley tells me. 'I used to go on various chat shows and debate the point, but really it comes down to just frivolous entertainment. Nobody makes the girls do it. To me, these contests are just entertainment.' In 1970, history was made at the Royal Albert Hall. While Bob Hope was busy making sexist jokes on stage ('it's been quite a cattle market - I've been out there checking calves') a group of Women's Liberation demonstrators prepared for action. A football rattle resounded through the hall, loud and untraceable. Hope, now halfway through a sentence, looked up from his mike, suddenly startled. On the live telecast of the event, you can see him in close-up, his mouth half-open, pausing and scanning the auditorium for the culprit. At that moment, from behind him comes a bursting balloon of flour. He turns around, like a rabbit in headlights, and runs for the wings. There were stink bombs and tomatoes thrown too, though they are invisible in the grainy images of the archives. In fact, the physical sabotage looks rather low-scale, but as a piece of activism it was a triumph. Hope returned to the stage, flustered and stricken, and gave an impromptu speech in impeccably bad taste, about dope and Vietnam; he was condemned more by his own words than by any flour bomb. Sally Alexander, now a historian at Goldmith's College London, was one of the demonstrators. She was arrested that night; later she was tried for assault and found not guilty. 'Our targets were the people who ran Miss World,' Alexander explains, 'and Bob Hope, because he'd been to Vietnam, and we wanted the media to be aware of the Women's Liberation Movement. The object of our anger and our frustration was, as we saw it, a system that left women with no other economic opportunities, except cleaning, or low-paid jobs at the very bottom of the wage hierarchy. So we decided to make a spectacle out of the event.' But, contrary to what might be supposed, they were not against the girls participating in Miss World. 'The demonstration was not against the contestants at all,' says Alexander, 'that's an important point. For the young women who wanted to enter a Miss World contest, it was a way out, it was exciting, it was fun - that was their choice. It was Mecca's activities we were opposed to. As we were arrested and dragged out, we bumped into the contestants, most of whom were very nice to us, and said, \"let them alone, they're only having their say\" - that kind of stuff.' More than 30 years after the event, Julia Morley, who had been standing backstage on that occasion, gripping Bob Hope's ankle so he wouldn't run away, tells me that no one has ever asked her opinion about it before. 'I had a lot of sympathy for women's lib,' she says now. 'The only thing that I found very difficult was that they didn't actually come to see me or talk to me. At the time, I was actually very much involved, and trying really hard to change things, but it takes time.' The 1970 demonstration did not have an immediate effect on Miss World, in the sense that the contest continues to this day. But the spectacle was symbolic of less visible work done for women's lives behind the scenes. And over time, the effects of that work have reverberated even on Miss World. Whether or not the contest is politically correct is not the crucial issue now: what is important is that it is not needed the way it was, that women have other options, and that wearing a bikini for a man's inspection is no longer seen as the road to freedom. Last year, two weeks after the fiftieth Miss World was crowned, Rosemarie Frankland, Miss World 1961 and the first Miss UK to win the title, committed suicide. She had told a newspaper not long beforehand that 'beauty queens are dressed up and paraded down the catwalk just so some fellow can get a quick thrill. They should shove it in the archives and forget about it.' Instead, Julia Morley is trying to resurrect it. The Miss World Organisation suggested that I speak to Diana Hayden, Miss World 1997. Hayden is one of the four Miss Indias who have won Miss World in the past seven years. She clearly represents the new model, since, as she tells me, 'they've been up on stage saying I'm the best Miss World they've ever had'. Hayden still does a lot of work for charity, and is now an international spokesperson for L'Or\u00e9al. She is having her hair done at the Dorchester hotel when we speak. I ask Hayden what she thinks of the demonstrations that took place in her home country the year before she won. 'They threatened to burn themselves,' she says, 'and nothing came of it, because they were just threats.' One man did burn himself to death, I tell her. 'Did he really?' Hayden asks. 'What a silly man! All they had to do was ask the girls, do you want to be here or not? You get treated like royalty, you travel first class, you live in presidential suites, you have bodyguards and chaperones, the prize money is $100,000 - hello! Who's complaining?' Hayden thinks Miss World has changed, and that the best policy is honesty. 'You don't bullshit them and tell them you want to save the world and heal the ozone layer and, you know, be Mother Teresa. I can't give up everything, I love life too much... Sorry...' she trails off, 'I sound awful.' Julia Morley's global expansion has hit one stumbling block so far: Donald Trump. Trump owns Miss Universe, and every time she tries to get into the US market, she says, 'Trump won't let me through the door. He's offered to buy me out, but he won't let me in. I've got to take his Miss America and their principles are different. I don't want a swimsuit walking around on stage - that's out and that's old.' Morley comes back to this subject later. 'I don't think I need to sell,' she tells me, unprompted. 'I don't want to hand it over, I know what I'm doing, I just need a little bit of time to put it all in place.' And then, mixing formidable determination with a tinge of uncertainty, she asks, 'There's nothing wrong with a woman running it, is there?'

All the parks are either already open or opening this weekend. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.blackpoolpleasurebeach.co.uk\">Blackpool Pleasure Beach</a><br> 0870 444 5566</p> <p> The park boasts five woodies - that's wooden roller coasters to the uninitiated - more than anywhere else on earth. My favourite is Grand National, a twin-track 60- year-old racer that never fails to get the adrenaline running. The park also boasts five steel roller coasters - steelies - which explains why it's my, and my 12- and 15-year-olds, favourite park. </p> <p>Nothing new this year but who cares? Last year they splashed out \u00a315 million on Valhalla 2000's barrage of special effects. The Pepsi Max Big One is Europe's tallest, fastest and best steel roller coaster - 235ft tall with a 65 first drop, followed by an 85mph ride over a mile of track. Limber up with Ice Blast - 80mph and 4.5g going up, 30 mph and -1g going down! </p> <p><strong> Opening hours:</strong> Daily until 4 November 2001. Opening and closing times vary, so ring ahead. </p> <p><strong> Admission price:</strong> Unlimited ride wristbands \u00a325, pink or white-knuckle sheets of tickets \u00a324, Beaver Creek Children's Park wristbands \u00a310.95 or sheets of tickets \u00a310. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.altontowers.com\">Alton Towers</a> <br>Staffordshire<br> 08705 204 060</p> <p>Apart from great rides, Alton Towers is the most civilised park with pretty gardens and a Skyride which floats you around high above the ground. New last year was Hex - a haunted swing ride through a turning cursed room (not a white knuckler unfor tunately). The \u00a312m Oblivion opened three years back - some love it but I'm not one of them. You queue for hours, are cranked to a precipice, held tantalisingly over the edge and then dropped 200 feet at 70mph into a black hole. It's all over in a twinkling. Far better is the sustained excitement of Nemesis, one of the truly great rides with thick-and-fast thrills, providing 'four seconds of total weightlessness and brain-scrambling g-forces of 4'. Second only to the Pepsi Max in my book. Other goodies to look out for are Ripsaw, Corkscrew, Black Hole (dark coaster), and Submission. </p> <p><strong> Opening hours:</strong> From 9.30am daily (rides open at 10) until 28 October. Closing time varies. </p> <p><strong> Admission price:</strong> Adults \u00a317, children aged 4-12 \u00a314.

The newly-themed children's area, Robinsons Land opens this year. The major new ride last year, Apocalypse, remains the world's only stand-up tower drop (180 feet - that's more than the height of Nelson's Column). Stormforce 10 opened the year before - Europe's only wet-knuckle ride with a reverse drop (do this last as you'll get soaked). My own favourite, however, remains Shock Wave, the first and only stand-up coaster in Europe. A blast. For those of you who appreciate such matters, the 120-feet high steelie performs four inversions: two corkscrews, one loop and one heart-line spiral. </p> <p><strong> Opening hours: </strong> Daily from 9am (rides from 10.30am) until 28 October, closing times vary. </p> <p><strong> Admission price: </strong> Adult (age 14 and over) \u00a315, child (900mm-13 yrs) \u00a311, child under 900mm free, family (2 adults 2 kids) \u00a347, family-of-five \u00a358. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pleasureland.uk.com\">Pleasureland</a><br>Southport<br>08702 200 204</p> <p>Pleasureland Southport has invested \u00a312m in new rides and attractions over the last three years, \u00a35m of which went on TRAUMAtizer, the tallest, fastest suspended coaster in the UK. A visit to the Moroccan Fun House is a must as it's one of the world's last traditional fun houses with pink-knuckle action including the wooden joy wheel, social mixer and rotating barrel, plus ball pools, and moving walkways. New last year was King Solomon's Mines, a classic woodie which joined its big brother The Cyclone. It complements Pleasureland's three steelies, TRAUMAtizer, The Wild Cat, and The Big Apple kiddie coaster. The park was voted 'Most promising park for the new millennium' by the Roller Coaster Club of Great Britain. </p> <p><strong> Opening hours:</strong> Open until 4 November 2001.

Zodiac takes riders through 360 at 30km per hour. Of the old favourites, Tidal Wave, Europe's highest water drop ride, provides the obligatory soaking.

      "body": "<p>When the door of a country pub creaks open to admit a stranger, popular myth dictates that the yokels sitting inside will stop talking and a conspiratorial silence will fall. </p> <p>It is a bit of pantomime-dramatics that has been parodied many times, perhaps most memorably in the cult film An American Werewolf in London, and yet the idea still goes to the heart of the mutual suspicions of city and country folk. </p> <p>Those who live in the city often regard the countryside as a rather mysterious theme park. When weekenders arrive in their hatchbacks and convertibles, they are looking for the standard series of romantic images, from quaint village greens to blasted heaths. It is up to the tourist trade to offer all this, or suffer the consequences. </p> <p>Over the past 50 days, of course, it has been a good deal harder than usual for the industry to send out the right message to its consumers. Foot and mouth has stamped down from nowhere and squashed many precariously balanced visitor attractions to the point of near death. </p> <p>As a result, it was with something of that pantomime, 'townie' trepidation that I drove into the deepest West, zooming past the gigantic statue of a running figure that is the South-West's answer to the Angel of the North . Meanwhile, Zoe from the tourist information office in Tiverton reassured Radio Devon listeners that it was quite safe to go to their favourite spots over the Easter holiday and every other ad-break on the sta tion seemed to carry a Government announcement with the same message. In one field I glimpsed a banner that read 'Food you can trust' while, a few miles on, a big piece of farm machinery bore the graffiti slogan 'Blair Out'. Everywhere in the rural landscape were reminders of the recent rows about fox hunting, BSE and GM crops - each problem now overshadowed by the advent of foot and mouth. </p> <p>Once in Devon, the county which, after Cumbria, is the most severely afflicted, the name of the country pub in that werewolf film, The Slaughtered Lamb, no longer seems quite so funny. These days the gruesome rituals performed by farmers are carried out on instructions from Westminster and will have a grave impact on their lives for years to come. It is soon clear that people here feel real fury about the Government's early advice not to venture into the countryside. The warning painted a picture of total shutdown, while, in fact, many visitor attractions were still open. </p> <p>'We are normally packed at this time of year,' said David, who runs a butterfly farm and otter sanctuary in Buckfastleigh. 'But we are almost 50 per cent down. I am just thankful that at least we haven't had to shut our doors.' </p> <p>This week more blighted visitor centres are reopening as the Government quickly backtracks and demands our support for rural tourism. Around Dartmoor, the steam railway to Totnes is running as usual and the cider centre and the neighbouring Dartington Hall Gardens are open too. The bee-keeping monks of Buckfast Abbey will show you their honey-making techniques by appointment and you can catch a boat down the river estuary to Dartmouth if you want to enjoy the landscape without the use of hiking boots. Off-road cyclists can also now make use of five Forestry Commission estates in the county and on Good Friday the National Trust sites at Coleton Fishacre, Castle Drogo and Bradley Manor all reopened too. The Devon coastline is also relatively unaffected by the crisis. The pier at Kiss-me-Quick Paignton was packed with families last weekend. </p> <p>So far, there are few visible signs of the impact of the crisis even on Devon's open farmland. Sheep and cattle are still grazing and the gorse and primroses are flowering for Easter, as they always do. It would be silly to pretend, though, that a holidaymaker wouldn't notice the sombre mood. </p> <p>'At first there was an air of resignation about it all,' one shopkeeper told me. 'Then, quite quickly, it turned to anger as people realised that it would affect pretty much the whole economy.' </p> <p>Devon has adopted a siege mentality, he added. 'My friend has a caravan site near the sea and no one has booked in for the spring. He does not know what he is going to do.' </p> <p>At Holne Chase, a country house hotel near Ashburton on the fringes of Dartmoor, business goes on as usual. Fires burn in the hearths and all the dining room tables are laid out beautifully, regardless of the fact that there are only a handful of guests. </p> <p>'We have a few more bookings now, but we really do want people to realise Devon is still open,' said Philippa Hughes, who owns the hotel with her husband Sebastian. 'It is true the moors are closed off and all the lay-bys and car parks are blocked, but there are plenty of villages to walk around and places to visit.' </p> <p>At this time of year the hotel would normally be full, so to boost their numbers the couple have laid down a challenge to Tony Blair. They have invited him to come and stay with them for free this spring and to spurn his usual Tuscan haunts. For the rest of us, there are enticements, too. Holne Chase is one of a number of places offering discounts, in this case, two nights for the price of one. </p> <p>'We have been worried about the disease spreading to the moor,' said Mrs Hughes. 'So far it has been left alone, but in 1967 they had to clear it of all livestock. I don't know how they would do that now. There are far more animals and fewer farmhands to help these days.' </p> <p>Guests at Holne Chase confirm that the foot and mouth measures already in place have done nothing to limit their fun. </p> <p>'After all, this hotel is set in 70 acres of its own grounds anyway,' said a visitor who had brought his family down from Newbury in Berkshire, 'so there are still plenty of places to walk.' </p> <p>And if it is space and a sense of isolation that you seek, the roads across the moor have never been so broodingly lonely. At the foot of Hound Tor, an imposing stack of stone that inspired Arthur Conan Doyle to write The Hound of the Baskervilles , a solitary Dartmoor pony was picking his way through the morasses and mires that cover the moor under slate skies. </p> <p>A little further along the road, the blighted burial place known as Jay's Grave is marked for the passer-by with a small bouquet.

      "bodyText": "When the door of a country pub creaks open to admit a stranger, popular myth dictates that the yokels sitting inside will stop talking and a conspiratorial silence will fall. It is a bit of pantomime-dramatics that has been parodied many times, perhaps most memorably in the cult film An American Werewolf in London, and yet the idea still goes to the heart of the mutual suspicions of city and country folk. Those who live in the city often regard the countryside as a rather mysterious theme park. When weekenders arrive in their hatchbacks and convertibles, they are looking for the standard series of romantic images, from quaint village greens to blasted heaths. It is up to the tourist trade to offer all this, or suffer the consequences. Over the past 50 days, of course, it has been a good deal harder than usual for the industry to send out the right message to its consumers. Foot and mouth has stamped down from nowhere and squashed many precariously balanced visitor attractions to the point of near death. As a result, it was with something of that pantomime, 'townie' trepidation that I drove into the deepest West, zooming past the gigantic statue of a running figure that is the South-West's answer to the Angel of the North . Meanwhile, Zoe from the tourist information office in Tiverton reassured Radio Devon listeners that it was quite safe to go to their favourite spots over the Easter holiday and every other ad-break on the sta tion seemed to carry a Government announcement with the same message. In one field I glimpsed a banner that read 'Food you can trust' while, a few miles on, a big piece of farm machinery bore the graffiti slogan 'Blair Out'. Everywhere in the rural landscape were reminders of the recent rows about fox hunting, BSE and GM crops - each problem now overshadowed by the advent of foot and mouth. Once in Devon, the county which, after Cumbria, is the most severely afflicted, the name of the country pub in that werewolf film, The Slaughtered Lamb, no longer seems quite so funny. These days the gruesome rituals performed by farmers are carried out on instructions from Westminster and will have a grave impact on their lives for years to come. It is soon clear that people here feel real fury about the Government's early advice not to venture into the countryside. The warning painted a picture of total shutdown, while, in fact, many visitor attractions were still open. 'We are normally packed at this time of year,' said David, who runs a butterfly farm and otter sanctuary in Buckfastleigh. 'But we are almost 50 per cent down. I am just thankful that at least we haven't had to shut our doors.' This week more blighted visitor centres are reopening as the Government quickly backtracks and demands our support for rural tourism. Around Dartmoor, the steam railway to Totnes is running as usual and the cider centre and the neighbouring Dartington Hall Gardens are open too. The bee-keeping monks of Buckfast Abbey will show you their honey-making techniques by appointment and you can catch a boat down the river estuary to Dartmouth if you want to enjoy the landscape without the use of hiking boots. Off-road cyclists can also now make use of five Forestry Commission estates in the county and on Good Friday the National Trust sites at Coleton Fishacre, Castle Drogo and Bradley Manor all reopened too. The Devon coastline is also relatively unaffected by the crisis. The pier at Kiss-me-Quick Paignton was packed with families last weekend. So far, there are few visible signs of the impact of the crisis even on Devon's open farmland. Sheep and cattle are still grazing and the gorse and primroses are flowering for Easter, as they always do. It would be silly to pretend, though, that a holidaymaker wouldn't notice the sombre mood. 'At first there was an air of resignation about it all,' one shopkeeper told me. 'Then, quite quickly, it turned to anger as people realised that it would affect pretty much the whole economy.' Devon has adopted a siege mentality, he added. 'My friend has a caravan site near the sea and no one has booked in for the spring. He does not know what he is going to do.' At Holne Chase, a country house hotel near Ashburton on the fringes of Dartmoor, business goes on as usual. Fires burn in the hearths and all the dining room tables are laid out beautifully, regardless of the fact that there are only a handful of guests. 'We have a few more bookings now, but we really do want people to realise Devon is still open,' said Philippa Hughes, who owns the hotel with her husband Sebastian. 'It is true the moors are closed off and all the lay-bys and car parks are blocked, but there are plenty of villages to walk around and places to visit.' At this time of year the hotel would normally be full, so to boost their numbers the couple have laid down a challenge to Tony Blair. They have invited him to come and stay with them for free this spring and to spurn his usual Tuscan haunts. For the rest of us, there are enticements, too. Holne Chase is one of a number of places offering discounts, in this case, two nights for the price of one. 'We have been worried about the disease spreading to the moor,' said Mrs Hughes. 'So far it has been left alone, but in 1967 they had to clear it of all livestock. I don't know how they would do that now. There are far more animals and fewer farmhands to help these days.' Guests at Holne Chase confirm that the foot and mouth measures already in place have done nothing to limit their fun. 'After all, this hotel is set in 70 acres of its own grounds anyway,' said a visitor who had brought his family down from Newbury in Berkshire, 'so there are still plenty of places to walk.' And if it is space and a sense of isolation that you seek, the roads across the moor have never been so broodingly lonely. At the foot of Hound Tor, an imposing stack of stone that inspired Arthur Conan Doyle to write The Hound of the Baskervilles , a solitary Dartmoor pony was picking his way through the morasses and mires that cover the moor under slate skies. A little further along the road, the blighted burial place known as Jay's Grave is marked for the passer-by with a small bouquet. Here a young servant girl who conceived out of wedlock and died was laid to rest outside the town boundary. The pathway around her grave may be roped off at the moment, but this has not stopped an anonymous hand placing the customary wild flowers on her grave. 'For 400 years that grave has always had flowers lying on it,' said Sebastian Hughes, back at the hotel. 'As boys we even slept up there one night to try to see who did it.' Eerie local folklore like this can still be enjoyed from the comfort of your car and there is no danger of spreading foot and mouth if you stick to the roads. If the moor eventually has to be cleared, this may well be the last chance to see its barren, close-cropped beauty for some years. Without livestock to keep it trim it will revert to scrubland in weeks and will stay that way until new animals can be safely introduced. Devon is clearly in collective pain, but it has lost none of its astonishing variety. A visit to the area at the moment is quite unforgettable, not just because it is so empty, but also because the county is at the centre of a major national crisis.

      "body": "<p>For the owners of Thai luxury hotel group the Banyan Tree, employing the Countess of Wessex's R-JH public relations firm could not have backfired more spectacularly. </p> <p>Murray Harkin, Sophie Wessex's former business partner, was at the centre of controversy after he allegedly offered to find a News of the World reporter posing as a sheikh a 'discreet villa' at the Phuket hotel and young boys. Doubtless, it was not the kind of offer the Banyan Tree would have made or the kind of publicity it would have wished. </p> <p>As Sophie told the fake sheikh: 'If anybody gets some kind of additional profile or benefit from being involved with us because of my situation, that's an unspoken benefit.' And no doubt that was the unspoken benefit the Banyan Tree was after. </p> <p>There are hundreds of travel PR companies in the UK to choose from. Why choose R-JH, whose only travel experience was publicising the Lanesborough Hotel in Hyde Park? The Lanesborough, being owned by an American company, was no doubt impressed by the royal association. </p> <p>The main reason for using a PR company is to get journalists to write about your products (editorial gets a much bigger response than anything from an advertisement). A good PR company is your lifeline to the journalists you need to know and ultimately the publications you want to see your hotel splashed in. Throwing champagne parties filled with pretty people, as Harkin suggested, does not get you on the travel pages. </p> <p>But Sophie doesn't know many travel journalists. In 11 years as a travel journalist, I cannot recall ever seeing a press release from her company (and if I did it must have been so unnewsworthy it failed to register on my brain). Nor have any of Sophie's minions ever called with a story. </p> <p>Except for a small incident almost two years ago when I was working at the Times . An eminent hotel PR phoned the travel editor asking if she'd like to join him and a friend, Sophie Wessex, for lunch_ </p> <p>The travel editor in question rarely lunched. But she was tempted out by the carrot of meeting royalty. Sophie dutifully turned up at the restaurant, smiled and met the travel editor. But it was her handsome bodyguard, rather than Sophie, whowas the talk of the office afterwards. The sad thing is that Sophie was too embarrassed, or inhibited, to ring travel editors herself. While she has used her name to get clients, she has been afraid of the journalists she needs to know to get her clients the column inches. </p> <p>It is believed that the Banyan Tree was planning to pay R-JH \u00a35,000 a month - well above the average for the size of the account. According to several travel PR companies, a normal figure is between \u00a32,000 and \u00a33,000 - which just shows how much extra naive companies will pay for a royal connection. 'You cannot assume because you have a royal on board, you get colour page spreads,' said another PR. </p> <p>Hotel PR companies are shocked and let down by R-JH's behaviour and the bad name it has given their trade. </p> <p>Ann Sadler, the PR representative for Elegant Resorts, CV Travel, the new Villa Nova in Barbados and Byblos Hotels in St Tropez and Courchevel, and a pro in the luxury hotel field describes what her job entails. She says: 'When I take on a client such as Byblos, I firstly write to key travel journalists introducing them to the hotel. You need to proclaim you are doing it in case the magazine or newspaper has a feature coming up on that area or they need pictures. I then try to get high-profile writers to review it on a professional basis. I will also organise one or two escorted trips for journalists a year.' </p> <p>She also contacts lifestyle and interiors magazines who might want to do a shoot at the hotel and contacts restaurant magazines about interviewing the hotel chef or finding a food angle. She visits hotels she promotes before publicising them so that she can talk about them to journalists first-hand. </p> <p>Some of the less slick hotel PRs use the bombardment approach: hundreds of press releases announcing non-existent news followed up by a phone call asking: 'Did you get my press release?' A phrase the countess may never reach for again, havingstepped down from her PR post.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For the owners of Thai luxury hotel group the Banyan Tree, employing the Countess of Wessex's R-JH public relations firm could not have backfired more spectacularly. Murray Harkin, Sophie Wessex's former business partner, was at the centre of controversy after he allegedly offered to find a News of the World reporter posing as a sheikh a 'discreet villa' at the Phuket hotel and young boys. Doubtless, it was not the kind of offer the Banyan Tree would have made or the kind of publicity it would have wished. As Sophie told the fake sheikh: 'If anybody gets some kind of additional profile or benefit from being involved with us because of my situation, that's an unspoken benefit.' And no doubt that was the unspoken benefit the Banyan Tree was after. There are hundreds of travel PR companies in the UK to choose from. Why choose R-JH, whose only travel experience was publicising the Lanesborough Hotel in Hyde Park? The Lanesborough, being owned by an American company, was no doubt impressed by the royal association. The main reason for using a PR company is to get journalists to write about your products (editorial gets a much bigger response than anything from an advertisement). A good PR company is your lifeline to the journalists you need to know and ultimately the publications you want to see your hotel splashed in. Throwing champagne parties filled with pretty people, as Harkin suggested, does not get you on the travel pages. But Sophie doesn't know many travel journalists. In 11 years as a travel journalist, I cannot recall ever seeing a press release from her company (and if I did it must have been so unnewsworthy it failed to register on my brain). Nor have any of Sophie's minions ever called with a story. Except for a small incident almost two years ago when I was working at the Times . An eminent hotel PR phoned the travel editor asking if she'd like to join him and a friend, Sophie Wessex, for lunch_ The travel editor in question rarely lunched. But she was tempted out by the carrot of meeting royalty. Sophie dutifully turned up at the restaurant, smiled and met the travel editor. But it was her handsome bodyguard, rather than Sophie, whowas the talk of the office afterwards. The sad thing is that Sophie was too embarrassed, or inhibited, to ring travel editors herself. While she has used her name to get clients, she has been afraid of the journalists she needs to know to get her clients the column inches. It is believed that the Banyan Tree was planning to pay R-JH \u00a35,000 a month - well above the average for the size of the account. According to several travel PR companies, a normal figure is between \u00a32,000 and \u00a33,000 - which just shows how much extra naive companies will pay for a royal connection. 'You cannot assume because you have a royal on board, you get colour page spreads,' said another PR. Hotel PR companies are shocked and let down by R-JH's behaviour and the bad name it has given their trade. Ann Sadler, the PR representative for Elegant Resorts, CV Travel, the new Villa Nova in Barbados and Byblos Hotels in St Tropez and Courchevel, and a pro in the luxury hotel field describes what her job entails. She says: 'When I take on a client such as Byblos, I firstly write to key travel journalists introducing them to the hotel. You need to proclaim you are doing it in case the magazine or newspaper has a feature coming up on that area or they need pictures. I then try to get high-profile writers to review it on a professional basis. I will also organise one or two escorted trips for journalists a year.' She also contacts lifestyle and interiors magazines who might want to do a shoot at the hotel and contacts restaurant magazines about interviewing the hotel chef or finding a food angle. She visits hotels she promotes before publicising them so that she can talk about them to journalists first-hand. Some of the less slick hotel PRs use the bombardment approach: hundreds of press releases announcing non-existent news followed up by a phone call asking: 'Did you get my press release?' A phrase the countess may never reach for again, havingstepped down from her PR post.",

A hundred and fifty years ago, before British colonial rule abolished slavery, the Dinka tribespeople, when they wanted to chide their children, would tell them: 'The camels are coming to take you away!' And almost 50 years after independence, the caravans are back, Arab raiders again carrying people off to work as slaves in the North.

      "body": "<p>Every fashion editor will tell you that the best places to shop are New York for T-shirts, jeans, basics and Kiehl's moisturiser, and Milan for Prada shoes at a third of their usual price. But before you go jetting off, we can let you into a secret: if you're sick of every high street looking the same, want to impress even your most fashionable friends, and want to have some fun while you're at it, there is nowhere quite like Antwerp, the fashion capital of Flanders. </p> <p>Since the early Eighties, when Belgian designers turned the fashion world upside down with their deconstructed clothes - all raw edges and inside out seams - Antwerp has become the fashion equivalent of Lourdes. It's a place of pilgrimage, with disciples visiting the crumbling old Academy of Fine Art to see where Martin Margiela and Co sewed their first stitches, and then to Louis, the shop that was the first to sell their collections. The fashion school is now in temporary premises, while a brand new Fashion Institute, complete with fashion museum, is being built. It is expected to open next year. Louis is still the best starting point for any shopping tour. It's a surprisingly small boutique, on Lombardenvest 2, in the old town. But it's the perfect place to get better acquainted with the best of Belgian fashion, from Ann Demeulemeester to Veronique Branquinho and Raf Simons. </p> <p>I tried on a huge, experimental square of black jersey by Margiela. However, coming out of the changing room, face to face with the two shop assistants, was a humbling, if not humiliating, experience. I could tell immediately by their faces that this was not a good look. Even my fellow shopper, Jo Adams, Observer fashion editor, was laughing. Something to do with my mismatched black ankle socks and red trainers, perhaps. </p> <p>Turn right out of Louis, and a two-minute walk along Lombardenvest takes you past Laundry Industry, selling high-street basics, Yosho, for unusual shoes, and De Groene Wolk, a designer baby boutique, to Korte Gasthuisstraat. Here you'll find retail therapy guaranteed to add inches to your waistline. Forget frocks for a moment. There's Goossens, the bakery which piles its windows full of delicious-looking fruit breads and cakes; Philips, the charming old biscuit shop, where you can buy freshly baked biscuits by weight, or tins of the hand-shaped butter-rich biscuits which are the symbol of Antwerp (Antwerpen means, literally, hand throw - the story goes that a giant once controlled the city, levying crippling taxes, until one day a young hero pulled his hand off and threw it into the river); and, of course, numerous chocolate shops. </p> <p>The locals buy chocolates as part of their weekly shop, along with other necessities such as fruit and veg. And why not? For the most delicious hand-made chocolates imaginable, make sure you make a detour to Del Rey, on Appelmansstraat 5, where the truffles and pralines are made fresh every day in a workshop on the premises. The smell alone is enough to satisfy most chocaholics. Just the thought of it was making our mouths water, and anyway, our feet were hurting after an hour's shopping. So we stopped for a coffee break at Desir de Lille, the tea shop which specialises in waffles. I ordered some apple fritters which arrived, groaning under their own weight in icing sugar. It was at this point that my thoughts began returning to the Margiela tent dress. If it meant I could spend my days eating waffles and beignets , perhaps I didn't care what the shop assistants thought after all. </p> <p>One of the many great things about Antwerp (along with chocolates, diamonds, waffles, beer, moules, jenever , and healthy portions of the best frites and mayonnaise in town, from Frituur No 1, at Hoogstraat 1) is that there are shops here that you won't find anywhere else, and they are all within walking distance. Ann Demeulemeester is on the corner of Leopold de Waelplaats and Verlatstraat. It's next to the kitchen specialists Obumex, where you'll find units designed by the minimalist architect John Pawson. </p> <p>More established is Dries Van Noten. The turn of the century, mosaic-tiled Modepaleis, as it's called, is quite a landmark, on Nationalestraat 16.

      "bodyText": "Every fashion editor will tell you that the best places to shop are New York for T-shirts, jeans, basics and Kiehl's moisturiser, and Milan for Prada shoes at a third of their usual price. But before you go jetting off, we can let you into a secret: if you're sick of every high street looking the same, want to impress even your most fashionable friends, and want to have some fun while you're at it, there is nowhere quite like Antwerp, the fashion capital of Flanders. Since the early Eighties, when Belgian designers turned the fashion world upside down with their deconstructed clothes - all raw edges and inside out seams - Antwerp has become the fashion equivalent of Lourdes. It's a place of pilgrimage, with disciples visiting the crumbling old Academy of Fine Art to see where Martin Margiela and Co sewed their first stitches, and then to Louis, the shop that was the first to sell their collections. The fashion school is now in temporary premises, while a brand new Fashion Institute, complete with fashion museum, is being built. It is expected to open next year. Louis is still the best starting point for any shopping tour. It's a surprisingly small boutique, on Lombardenvest 2, in the old town. But it's the perfect place to get better acquainted with the best of Belgian fashion, from Ann Demeulemeester to Veronique Branquinho and Raf Simons. I tried on a huge, experimental square of black jersey by Margiela. However, coming out of the changing room, face to face with the two shop assistants, was a humbling, if not humiliating, experience. I could tell immediately by their faces that this was not a good look. Even my fellow shopper, Jo Adams, Observer fashion editor, was laughing. Something to do with my mismatched black ankle socks and red trainers, perhaps. Turn right out of Louis, and a two-minute walk along Lombardenvest takes you past Laundry Industry, selling high-street basics, Yosho, for unusual shoes, and De Groene Wolk, a designer baby boutique, to Korte Gasthuisstraat. Here you'll find retail therapy guaranteed to add inches to your waistline. Forget frocks for a moment. There's Goossens, the bakery which piles its windows full of delicious-looking fruit breads and cakes; Philips, the charming old biscuit shop, where you can buy freshly baked biscuits by weight, or tins of the hand-shaped butter-rich biscuits which are the symbol of Antwerp (Antwerpen means, literally, hand throw - the story goes that a giant once controlled the city, levying crippling taxes, until one day a young hero pulled his hand off and threw it into the river); and, of course, numerous chocolate shops. The locals buy chocolates as part of their weekly shop, along with other necessities such as fruit and veg. And why not? For the most delicious hand-made chocolates imaginable, make sure you make a detour to Del Rey, on Appelmansstraat 5, where the truffles and pralines are made fresh every day in a workshop on the premises. The smell alone is enough to satisfy most chocaholics. Just the thought of it was making our mouths water, and anyway, our feet were hurting after an hour's shopping. So we stopped for a coffee break at Desir de Lille, the tea shop which specialises in waffles. I ordered some apple fritters which arrived, groaning under their own weight in icing sugar. It was at this point that my thoughts began returning to the Margiela tent dress. If it meant I could spend my days eating waffles and beignets , perhaps I didn't care what the shop assistants thought after all. One of the many great things about Antwerp (along with chocolates, diamonds, waffles, beer, moules, jenever , and healthy portions of the best frites and mayonnaise in town, from Frituur No 1, at Hoogstraat 1) is that there are shops here that you won't find anywhere else, and they are all within walking distance. Ann Demeulemeester is on the corner of Leopold de Waelplaats and Verlatstraat. It's next to the kitchen specialists Obumex, where you'll find units designed by the minimalist architect John Pawson. More established is Dries Van Noten. The turn of the century, mosaic-tiled Modepaleis, as it's called, is quite a landmark, on Nationalestraat 16. The shop assistants are friendly and helpful and will happily convert prices into sterling if you ask. And do ask, because while you will want to buy handfuls of delicately beaded chiffon tops, floral printed dresses, fantastically cut trousers, and juicy-coloured knits, these clothes are not cheap. They are however, the sort of clothes you will wear forever, like family heirlooms.

Now it's a gap year - essential for the enterprising sixth-former - and it doesn't count unless you go somewhere very Third World. The gap-year phenomenon originated with the months left over to Oxbridge applicants between entrance exams in November and the start of the next academic year. Nowadays, Oxford and Cambridge make conditional offers before A-levels, like everyone else, but the gap year has exploded, becoming a kind of finishing school for the middle classes. One estimate puts the numbers taking such a break at between 100,000 and 200,000 a year. </p> <p> The notion that digging a well in Ethiopia is a valuable experience has been helped by backing from the Department for Education and Employment and Ucas, the university admissions service, both of which have endorsed the value of deferring entry to university. The internet has, meanwhile, given pupils greater access to organisations providing gap-year experiences. </p> <p> As a result, the number of gap-year providers has mushroomed into the hundreds. They offer expeditions, volunteering, work placements and cultural and language courses. Some are charities, others highly profitable companies. It is difficult to tell them apart at first sight - any sort of organisation can promise that you, like Prince William, can scrub floors in Chile - but they turn out to be very different. </p> <p> Lisa O'Donnelly applied to teach English in Ethiopia with a commercial provider. Unusually, she had more than one year off before starting at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London and already had a qualification in teaching English as a foreign language. When she arrived in Africa, she found there was no school and no one to teach. 'I was in a physiotherapy centre for children with polio from all over Ethiopia. It was a good project, but there was nothing there for me to do. In England, I was told I needed an induction, for which I was charged \u00a3250. It was mostly about teaching English and I didn't want to go, because I'd already taught for a year at this stage, in India and Nepal. </p> <p> 'There were two of us going to this project in Ethiopia, but a month beforehand the other girl dropped out. I was warned if I didn't go, I'd lose all my money. I was also told there would be a language induction in the first week, but the local representative put me in a hotel five miles outside Addis and then disappeared for seven days. When I complained, I was told I didn't understand the Third World. </p> <p> 'The company claimed to have checked out the project, but it turned out that no one had been there. I paid \u00a3250 a month for a room on the project compound, even though my hotel had cost about 50p a night. I asked for a breakdown of the costs from the company, but they couldn't give me one. They said everything was admin.' </p> <p> Last week, O'Donnelly, who fought to get back the several thousand pounds she paid, spoke at a conference in Manchester organised by Tourism Concern aiming to bring together students and provider organisations, and to consider whether gap years are as good for dirt-poor destinations as for the young Brits who descend on them. </p> <p> Michael Lomotey, who is half-English, half-Ghanaian, organised the conference after being shocked by the behaviour of British gap-year students in Ghana. 'Their cultural insensitivity is incredible. They dress inappropriately, wearing shorts in the marketplace and they haggle without smiling. I've seen British gappers get into a fist fight with a taxi driver over the equivalent of 20p, which would matter to him, but not to them. </p> <p> 'On one flight out to Ghana, I travelled with 70 gappers. Most had received no training, no induction into the culture. I kept wondering if 10 of them were going to build a well and they'd each paid \u00a31,000, what could the community have done with that money?' </p> <p> Last May, 20 of the larger gap providers formed the Year Out Group, a trade association, in a bid to prevent the kind of experiences that Lisa had. The group now has 23 members and, according to its chief executive Richard Oliver, 'aims to agree standards and promote the benefits of a structured year out'. Its website offers a useful list of questions for students and parents: what exactly will I be doing? Is the host organisation paid? What are the hidden costs? And how will I be supported? </p> <p> As Lavinia Bristol, who runs Project Trust, one of the best gap-year organisations, says: 'Eighteen-year-olds are extraordinarily bad at being discerning consumers. Even on our selection courses, they don't ask questions that you'd think might be obvious, such as how they're going to be looked after or how the project's been vetted.' </p> <p> But more radical critics, like Jim Cogan, founder of Student Partnerships Worldwide, one of the oldest and most distinguished organisations, question whether gap years in poor countries are of any benefit. 'The danger is that if untrained British students go out to poor countries that are riddled with disease and malnutrition, they are likely to end up debauching themselves by the ocean or on the shores of Lake Malawi in little hedonistic enclaves. They can enjoy the cheap cost of living, have an interesting four months and come home. There is a big moral issue here, which is conveniently being overlooked.' </p> <p> The trouble is that there are many different kinds of gap-year provider, some with more honourable intentions than others. On the one hand, there are organisa tions such as Project Trust, a charity that took over Voluntary Service Overseas' 18-year-olds programme, and selects its 200 participants on the basis of a five-day assessment on the Isle of Coll in Scotland. It provides a week-long training course and sends gappers to their projects for an entire year. Student Partnerships Worldwide trains 250 British students alongside the same number of young people from host countries for a month and specialises in teaching adolescents in countries with high levels of Aids and HIV how to avoid infection. </p> <p> On the other hand, Teaching and Projects Abroad is a commercial company. Its 1,000 students can decide when they want to go and for how long. The question then arises: how different is this from an ordinary tour company? And if students can dip in and out of the projects, how important are the jobs they are doing? </p> <p> Kevin Dynan, in charge of recruitment for the company (which would probably be called marketing elsewhere), points out reasonably enough that not all gappers are ready to make the 12-month commitment required by some organisations. 'With us, they go initially for three months, which is long enough to stick it out and also to make some contribution.' He says there is some in-country induction, and in areas where cultural faux pas are a real risk, 'we might have a chat with people before they go'. </p> <p> He acknowledges that there are periods when no one is filling the posts, 'but in teaching, it's not necessarily a problem, as they're very much language assistants. Other projects are more about training - shadowing a doctor or working in a radio station'. And what's the difference between them and a holiday company? 'We're not interested in making huge amounts of profit.' </p> <p> It is, in fact, extremely difficult to compare the costs of different organisations, because advertised prices often don't include airfares, insurance, pocket money or language and induction programmes and cover different periods of time. As a general rule, expeditions are more expensive than volunteering or work placements, and you are unlikely to get away with much under \u00a33,000. Lavinia Bristol of Project Trust has attempted to calculate relative costs and concluded that Gap is the cheapest (with Project Trust next) and something called, improbably, Ski Le Gap is the most expensive. </p> <p> Not least thanks to cheap flights and a better travelled population, the popularity of gap years looks set only to rise. Eighteen-year-olds are a tremendous resource and eager to be used, especially if that buys them a period in an exotic place. </p>",

They said everything was admin.' Last week, O'Donnelly, who fought to get back the several thousand pounds she paid, spoke at a conference in Manchester organised by Tourism Concern aiming to bring together students and provider organisations, and to consider whether gap years are as good for dirt-poor destinations as for the young Brits who descend on them. Michael Lomotey, who is half-English, half-Ghanaian, organised the conference after being shocked by the behaviour of British gap-year students in Ghana. 'Their cultural insensitivity is incredible. They dress inappropriately, wearing shorts in the marketplace and they haggle without smiling. I've seen British gappers get into a fist fight with a taxi driver over the equivalent of 20p, which would matter to him, but not to them. 'On one flight out to Ghana, I travelled with 70 gappers. Most had received no training, no induction into the culture. I kept wondering if 10 of them were going to build a well and they'd each paid \u00a31,000, what could the community have done with that money?' Last May, 20 of the larger gap providers formed the Year Out Group, a trade association, in a bid to prevent the kind of experiences that Lisa had. The group now has 23 members and, according to its chief executive Richard Oliver, 'aims to agree standards and promote the benefits of a structured year out'. Its website offers a useful list of questions for students and parents: what exactly will I be doing? Is the host organisation paid? What are the hidden costs? And how will I be supported? As Lavinia Bristol, who runs Project Trust, one of the best gap-year organisations, says: 'Eighteen-year-olds are extraordinarily bad at being discerning consumers. Even on our selection courses, they don't ask questions that you'd think might be obvious, such as how they're going to be looked after or how the project's been vetted.' But more radical critics, like Jim Cogan, founder of Student Partnerships Worldwide, one of the oldest and most distinguished organisations, question whether gap years in poor countries are of any benefit. 'The danger is that if untrained British students go out to poor countries that are riddled with disease and malnutrition, they are likely to end up debauching themselves by the ocean or on the shores of Lake Malawi in little hedonistic enclaves. They can enjoy the cheap cost of living, have an interesting four months and come home. There is a big moral issue here, which is conveniently being overlooked.' The trouble is that there are many different kinds of gap-year provider, some with more honourable intentions than others. On the one hand, there are organisa tions such as Project Trust, a charity that took over Voluntary Service Overseas' 18-year-olds programme, and selects its 200 participants on the basis of a five-day assessment on the Isle of Coll in Scotland. It provides a week-long training course and sends gappers to their projects for an entire year. Student Partnerships Worldwide trains 250 British students alongside the same number of young people from host countries for a month and specialises in teaching adolescents in countries with high levels of Aids and HIV how to avoid infection. On the other hand, Teaching and Projects Abroad is a commercial company. Its 1,000 students can decide when they want to go and for how long. The question then arises: how different is this from an ordinary tour company? And if students can dip in and out of the projects, how important are the jobs they are doing? Kevin Dynan, in charge of recruitment for the company (which would probably be called marketing elsewhere), points out reasonably enough that not all gappers are ready to make the 12-month commitment required by some organisations. 'With us, they go initially for three months, which is long enough to stick it out and also to make some contribution.' He says there is some in-country induction, and in areas where cultural faux pas are a real risk, 'we might have a chat with people before they go'. He acknowledges that there are periods when no one is filling the posts, 'but in teaching, it's not necessarily a problem, as they're very much language assistants. Other projects are more about training - shadowing a doctor or working in a radio station'. And what's the difference between them and a holiday company? 'We're not interested in making huge amounts of profit.' It is, in fact, extremely difficult to compare the costs of different organisations, because advertised prices often don't include airfares, insurance, pocket money or language and induction programmes and cover different periods of time. As a general rule, expeditions are more expensive than volunteering or work placements, and you are unlikely to get away with much under \u00a33,000. Lavinia Bristol of Project Trust has attempted to calculate relative costs and concluded that Gap is the cheapest (with Project Trust next) and something called, improbably, Ski Le Gap is the most expensive. Not least thanks to cheap flights and a better travelled population, the popularity of gap years looks set only to rise. Eighteen-year-olds are a tremendous resource and eager to be used, especially if that buys them a period in an exotic place.",

Their origins were very similar: both Viennese Jews; both left and went to English-speaking countries; between them, they alerted the English-speaking world to the currents of philosophical thought evolving in Vienna and, between them, changed the whole tenor of philosophical investigations. They had similar, prickly personalities, and similar personal austerities; both became the unwilling object of a cult. </p> <p>But the only occasion they are recorded meeting ended with Wittgenstein taking a poker to Popper and having to be restrained. They regarded each other, in fact, with undisguised hostility and contempt. Perhaps, when two people are very similar, their differences always become a mark of conspicuous contention; think how strange it would be if only one of a pair of identical twins decided to have her ears pierced, how it would draw the eye. </p> <p>The philosophical differences between Popper and Wittgenstein were vast, and probably could not have been bridged, but one feels that their unremitting hostility towards each other came from a deeper, odder source. They looked at each other and saw that was what they might have become, what they had rejected, and their contempt rose. </p> <p>Wittgenstein's greatness and originality is probably beyond question now and was promptly recognised. When he handed in his first book as his thesis, G.E. Moore's examiner's report read: 'It is my personal opinion that Mr Wittgenstein's thesis is a work of genius; but be that as it may, it is certainly well up to the standard required for the Cambridge degree of doctor of philosophy.' </p> <p>But in many ways, Popper was the more recognisable philosopher. Where Wittgenstein dismissed most of the traditional questions of philosophy, such as ethics and metaphysics, in favour of a discussion of pure linguistic concepts, Popper always remained more worldly. The Open Society and its Enemies, a wildly controversial attack on Plato, is the sort of engaged book which philosophy has always produced. </p> <p>Wittgenstein would have denied that it was philosophy at all, and the Philosophical Investigations represent something quite new and not in any sense - in the famous formula - a 'footnote to Plato'. </p> <p>Wittgenstein's story is well known and still alarming. He came from an extremely rich Viennese family and gave away all his money (he said later, with uncharacteristic silliness: 'If you were going for a long hike up a steep mountain, you would deposit your weighty rucksack at the bottom'). Still, those patrician values had an odd way of surfacing in later life - he startled Cambridge friends by describing the gowns at a Trinity May Ball as 'tawdry' - and perhaps gave him the confidence to dismiss the work of contemporaries, not at all politely. </p> <p>Not just contemporaries, either; to Wittgenstein, the whole tradition of German idealism was nothing more than, as Edmonds and Eidenow say, 'obfuscation, mumbo-jumbo and muddle-headedness'. </p> <p>Wittgenstein was famously rude; when poor Lydia Lopokova said on a walk: 'What a beautiful tree', Wittgenstein barked back: 'What do you mean?' and she dissolved into tears. Talking to philosophers, Wittgenstein saw rudeness as a necessary dismissal; to discuss many of the traditional questions of philosophy was to reveal oneself as a charlatan. </p> <p>Not everyone went along with the exhilarating dismissals of Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle; A.J. Ayer later said: 'Well, I suppose the most important of the defects was that nearly all of it was false.' </p> <p>Popper led the charge against, describing Wittgenstein's picture theory of language as 'hopelessly and indeed outrageously mistaken'. For Popper, the clearing out of philosophical discourse was the first task, not the only one, of the philosopher; cleaning the glasses through which the philosopher must then peer. </p> <p>He believed in the existence of philosophical questions and when he was invited to talk on the subject to a Cambridge discussion group, the stage was set for disagreement and physical assault. </p> <p>Not much is known about the details of the meeting, but it forms an intriguing centre to this entertaining and thoughtful book. There are enough very funny stories about Wittgenstein to make the story interesting even to a resolute non-philosopher like me, who shrinks from propositions like 'All non-ravens are non-black'. </p> <p>Who won? Well, in some sense, Wittgenstein, since his ideas powerfully shaped all postwar thought and directed our attention towards the linguistic world. But Popper, in the end, made as considerable an impact - he was Mrs Thatcher's favourite philosopher, after all - and it is difficult not to reflect that Wittgenstein's stance, though a necessary one, resembles someone trying to turn back the tide. </p> <p>People will always go on talking about questions of ethics and metaphysics and it takes more than a few Cambridge philosophers to dissuade them. Whereof we cannot speak, thereof we will go on guessing, I suppose.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wittgenstein's Poker David Edmonds and John Eidinow Faber \u00a39.99, pp267 Buy it at a discount at BOL Karl Popper and Ludwig Wittgenstein ought to have had a great deal to talk about. Their origins were very similar: both Viennese Jews; both left and went to English-speaking countries; between them, they alerted the English-speaking world to the currents of philosophical thought evolving in Vienna and, between them, changed the whole tenor of philosophical investigations. They had similar, prickly personalities, and similar personal austerities; both became the unwilling object of a cult. But the only occasion they are recorded meeting ended with Wittgenstein taking a poker to Popper and having to be restrained. They regarded each other, in fact, with undisguised hostility and contempt. Perhaps, when two people are very similar, their differences always become a mark of conspicuous contention; think how strange it would be if only one of a pair of identical twins decided to have her ears pierced, how it would draw the eye. The philosophical differences between Popper and Wittgenstein were vast, and probably could not have been bridged, but one feels that their unremitting hostility towards each other came from a deeper, odder source. They looked at each other and saw that was what they might have become, what they had rejected, and their contempt rose. Wittgenstein's greatness and originality is probably beyond question now and was promptly recognised. When he handed in his first book as his thesis, G.E. Moore's examiner's report read: 'It is my personal opinion that Mr Wittgenstein's thesis is a work of genius; but be that as it may, it is certainly well up to the standard required for the Cambridge degree of doctor of philosophy.' But in many ways, Popper was the more recognisable philosopher. Where Wittgenstein dismissed most of the traditional questions of philosophy, such as ethics and metaphysics, in favour of a discussion of pure linguistic concepts, Popper always remained more worldly. The Open Society and its Enemies, a wildly controversial attack on Plato, is the sort of engaged book which philosophy has always produced. Wittgenstein would have denied that it was philosophy at all, and the Philosophical Investigations represent something quite new and not in any sense - in the famous formula - a 'footnote to Plato'. Wittgenstein's story is well known and still alarming. He came from an extremely rich Viennese family and gave away all his money (he said later, with uncharacteristic silliness: 'If you were going for a long hike up a steep mountain, you would deposit your weighty rucksack at the bottom'). Still, those patrician values had an odd way of surfacing in later life - he startled Cambridge friends by describing the gowns at a Trinity May Ball as 'tawdry' - and perhaps gave him the confidence to dismiss the work of contemporaries, not at all politely. Not just contemporaries, either; to Wittgenstein, the whole tradition of German idealism was nothing more than, as Edmonds and Eidenow say, 'obfuscation, mumbo-jumbo and muddle-headedness'. Wittgenstein was famously rude; when poor Lydia Lopokova said on a walk: 'What a beautiful tree', Wittgenstein barked back: 'What do you mean?' and she dissolved into tears. Talking to philosophers, Wittgenstein saw rudeness as a necessary dismissal; to discuss many of the traditional questions of philosophy was to reveal oneself as a charlatan. Not everyone went along with the exhilarating dismissals of Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle; A.J. Ayer later said: 'Well, I suppose the most important of the defects was that nearly all of it was false.' Popper led the charge against, describing Wittgenstein's picture theory of language as 'hopelessly and indeed outrageously mistaken'. For Popper, the clearing out of philosophical discourse was the first task, not the only one, of the philosopher; cleaning the glasses through which the philosopher must then peer. He believed in the existence of philosophical questions and when he was invited to talk on the subject to a Cambridge discussion group, the stage was set for disagreement and physical assault. Not much is known about the details of the meeting, but it forms an intriguing centre to this entertaining and thoughtful book. There are enough very funny stories about Wittgenstein to make the story interesting even to a resolute non-philosopher like me, who shrinks from propositions like 'All non-ravens are non-black'. Who won? Well, in some sense, Wittgenstein, since his ideas powerfully shaped all postwar thought and directed our attention towards the linguistic world. But Popper, in the end, made as considerable an impact - he was Mrs Thatcher's favourite philosopher, after all - and it is difficult not to reflect that Wittgenstein's stance, though a necessary one, resembles someone trying to turn back the tide. People will always go on talking about questions of ethics and metaphysics and it takes more than a few Cambridge philosophers to dissuade them. Whereof we cannot speak, thereof we will go on guessing, I suppose.",

      "body": "<p>Meet Tom. He's mad. Mad as a bat, as a badger, as a bag of spanners. In the nicest, most harmless way of course, but mad, barking, daft, tapped, a can short of a six pack, a ha'penny short of a shilling.</p> <p>He admits it, too. And that's the first step back to health. But Tom doesn't want to get better. He wants to convert the world, he wants everyone to share in his secret joy, he wants to broadcast his passion in the most flagrantly promiscuous way, he wants everyone to hear the voices that have spoken to him since he was very, very young.</p> <p>Tom Hart Dyke, a perfectly presentable 24-year-old from a small village in Kent, has no outward signs of delusion. But Tom is in love with plants.</p> <p>Not any old plants either, though he admits a yen for eucalypts and a soft spot for certain spiny shrubs. Tom is obsessed with flowers. But not any old flowers. Tom is in love with the royal family of the flower world. He is genuinely, deeply, tragically in love with orchids. And, as everybody knows, lunacy and love go hand in hand.</p> <p>Nearly a year ago Tom and a friend - Paul Winder, a merchant banker on a sabbatical from the City - hired two local guides and set off into the Darien Gap, a fetid, malaria-ridden slice of primary rainforest and swamp that straddles the borders of Panama and Colombia. Tom wanted to find rare orchids. His mate came along for a laugh. But, as swiftly became very clear, there aren't many laughs to be had in the Darien Gap.</p> <p>There are roads all the way from Alaska to southern Argentina - except for in the Darien Gap. There is, more or less, some kind of law and order, too - except in the Darien Gap. Its stinking thousand or so square miles of jungle act as a sump under the two continents it bisects. So, in addition to the many and varied natural hazards (more of these later), it is full of bandits, fugitives, drug traffickers, junkies, bounty hunters, renegades, left-wing guerrillas, right-wing death squads, killers who have found religion, priests who have lost their faith - and Tom, his mate Paul and a cheap Chinese tent.</p> <p>A road, shedding prosperity like a skin as it goes, coils down from the north through Central America. Yaviza - a small town with a few filthy hotels - is pretty much what you'd imagine would be at the wrong end of the American rainbow. Several trails lead off into the Darien Gap. One day in March last year, Tom Hart Dyke and his friend, full of bounce and brio, set off down one.</p> <p>Early on the third morning they saw that their guides, who had been a little ahead of them, had stopped and were standing very still. Among the undergrowth 10 yards away were a dozen figures in camouflage fatigues. There was a short conversation in rapid and heavily accented Spanish. Despite the gloom of the deep forest, the pair saw the guns that were pointed at them and raised their hands and dropped to their knees. Then they lay down with their faces in the dark, moist jungle earth. The guerrillas, covering them with M16s and handguns, tied their wrists together behind their backs. Around them, the forest hooted and shrilled and cawed and croaked. </p> <p>After half an hour, the guerrillas spoke directly to the two men for the first time. 'Are you going to run?' they asked. 'No' said Tom, and they were untied. The next time anyone heard from the pair was more than six months later.</p> <p>Tom may be in love with orchids but the feelings aroused in others are earthier. The very name is derived from orchis, the Greek for testicle, and refers not only to the shape of the plant's tubers but also to the long-held belief that orchids sprang from the spilled semen of mating animals. The Greeks believed that plant parts resembled the bodily part they could be used to treat. So, logically enough, they dried the tubers and used them to treat impotence. Some in the Far East still do this, though orchid tubers are a popular cure for bronchitis, too. </p> <p>A Herbal Guide, published in England in 1653, advised that orchids be treated with care: 'They are hot and moist in operation, under the dominion of Venus, and provoke lust exceedingly.' Even today, orchid lovers fervently splutter about a specimen's fine erect stamen, or luscious purple lips. </p> <p>Dr Phillip Cribb is curator of orchids at Kew Gardens. He may be a minor deity in the botanical world as a whole, but he is Jupiter in the orchid-lovers' pantheon. He is also modest and approachable. His analysis of the attraction of orchids is less Freudian.</p> <p>'People love orchids because of their incredible diversity,' he says. 'They are the largest family of flowering plants. There could easily be 30,000, including some of the world's most beautiful flowers. There are many new species still to be discovered.'</p> <p>He's right about the variety. Some orchids weigh more than a tonne and spill out across a 100ft of forest, like a huge vine. The smallest is the size of a fingernail. Some smell wonderful. The carrion orchid doesn't. Some are extraordinary in their excess of colour, others are as drab as Charlie Dimmock's T-shirts. They grow in almost every climate, all over the world.</p> <p>What they all share is an identical structure - arranged symmetrically are two petals, two sepals in front of them and a lower leaf that usually curls and is known as the lip. They are designed to attract insects, thus the pornographically lurid hues.</p> <p>But if neither sex nor aesthetics draw you in, then social aspiration might. The Duke of Devonshire was one of the pioneers of the new 'orchid houses' and Queen Victoria was proud of her own collection. 'The orchid has always had a certain cachet,' says Dr Cribb.</p> <p>And they've always inspired obsession and craving. Victorians apparently confessed to suffering a general 'orchidelerium'. They were the ones who really got the orchid fad going. And the demand from newly enriched, newly leisured classes was insatiable. Big collectors dispatched orchid hunters throughout the world. Then, as now, novelty and exoticism drove the market, and buyers paid thousands of guineas in London salesrooms for the latest specimens wrenched from the earth of Sarawak, Brunei, Nepal or Arunachal Pradesh. The collectors sent out to foreign parts were not aristocrats. Instead, the British gentry - and many newly rich self-made men in the textile cities of the north - stayed home and dispatched their servants out into the wild to do the grubby job of dragging the plants from the soil. Many of the orchid-hunters paid with their lives. </p> <p>By the 1960s, commercial growers were mass-producing orchids for general consumption. But, though you can buy an orchid for a tenner at a garden centre, orchid fever is as fierce as ever. It's a \u00a37bn-a-year business. The best orchids have as refined a pedigree as any Cruft's winning dog and sell for as much as a small house in Leeds. Top orchid breeders' top plants are priceless. With any one flowering orchid capable of producing thousands of seedlings, a popular and productive mature plant is a licence to print money. And where there is money and obsession and beauty and exotic locations, there is - in the style of all good thrillers - crime.</p> <p>Keeping an eye on the old ladies with their Thermoses, the tweedy gents up from Buckinghamshire and the international criminal masterminds at Kew Gardens' annual orchid festival this year, were 14 police officers. They provided a 24-hour guard for the best orchids. The rest of the year, glass panels and CCTV do the job. Kew's orchids are among the best-guarded flowers in the world.</p> <p>So what are the police scared of? A Rafflesesque flower thief with an MG and a Mayfair flat? A Dome-style smash-and-grab tuber raid, complete with speedboat on the Thames, sawn-offs and dialogue from the Long Good Friday ('Shaddup, you long streak of paralysed paphiopedilum')?</p> <p>Charles McKay heads up Her Majesty's Customs and Excise 'Cites' (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) team at Heathrow. Under the convention, some rare species of orchid are proscribed - it is illegal to remove them from their habitats in the wild - others need permits in order to be transported and sold. Gram for gram, a very rare orchid can be worth more than Class A drugs. </p> <p>Last September, two of McKay's men inspected a shipment of orchids from Taiwan for a British professional grower. Packed in boxes in the airport freight terminal were plants with a retail value of \u00a360,000. Some had the necessary permits. Many didn't. The orchids, as experts at Kew confirmed, were indeed being smuggled. The consignment was confiscated, but no one was prosecuted. 'It's pretty hard to get hard evidence,' says McKay.</p> <p>The case was not unusual. The Cites team seizes thousands of orchids each year. The best-known orchid scandal is the case of Henry Azadehdel, a self-taught botanist and UFO fanatic from Nottingham. In 1986, after years of travelling through China, Malaysia, Borneo, Chile and Peru, Azadehdel was stopped at Heathrow with 15 undeclared plants from Chile in his luggage. He was accused of plundering endangered orchid species around the world, bringing at least one of them to the verge of extinction in its natural habitat, and brought to trial. Though he had a previously undiscovered orchid named after him in recognition of his legitimate work, he was alleged to have made \u00a3200,000 from smuggling and selling rare plants at the same time. </p> <p>One lady's slipper orchid, ripped from the ground in Borneo, was alleged to have been sold for \u00a316,000. When the police raided three greenhouses at Azadehdel's home they found 438 orchids, worth \u00a342,000, of which 334 were endangered species that had been 'jungle-collected'.</p> <p>The argument among orchid lovers is whether Azadehdel was a fanatic whose obsession had got out of control, or a ruthless exploiter of a fevered market. </p> <p>After inquiries all over the world, the Nottingham orchid buff went down for a 12-month sentence and got a \u00a320,000 fine. </p> <p>'I don't want any part of it anymore,' said Azadehdel in an interview after his conviction. 'The orchid world is dirty.'</p> <p>So dirty that somewhere in the north of England, at a top-secret location known only to a few senior botanists, private security guards keep a watch on the last remaining specimen in the UK of a particular type of lady's slipper orchid. It had always been rare in Britain but a combination of avaricious amateur gardeners and the destruction of its natural habitat pushed it to the bring of extinction. For 80 years a single flowering plant held on - the sole survivor of the species. Then, a few years ago, experts managed to get seeds from it and raised thousands of seedlings in greenhouses. These are now being reintroduced to the wild and, last year, for the first time, one of the seedlings flowered in the wild. Like its parent plant, it had a slipper-shaped golden lip and petals that swept back and spiralled towards the ground and was very, very beautiful.</p> <p>'It's terrible,' says Tom Hart Dyke shaking his head and grinning and hopping from one leg to the other. 'I mean it's bizarre, weird. I can't explain it. It's awful, terrible, and from such an early age. It is an obsession, an obsession - really only word for it.' And he shakes his head again and smiles beatifically.</p> <p>Tom is standing in his orchid sheds at the bottom of the garden of his parent's house. The gardens are 140 acres of prime Kentish countryside and the house is a gigantic 16th-century rambling pile called Lullingstone Castle. It has portraits of men in ruffs on the walls, roundheads' armour and one of the few remaining Tudor gatehouses in Britain. Tom is showing me a purple, yellow and white slipper orchid and is so excited that his knees are actually shaking. This is a man who, when he had an few hours stopover in Tokyo airport, spent it finding a janitor to open up the airport garden 'to see if there was anything interesting'. The flowers in his shed are wonderful and the orchid he is showing me is undeniably gorgeous but are, I can't help but think, only plants.</p> <p>Tom started on orchids when he was at primary school and he found them growing in the playground. His teenage years were spent dreaming, collecting, planning, growing plants. This is not normal, I point out, and he happily agrees.</p> <p>'No, no, terrible - not normal at all. I didn't even know how to spell \"girls\",' he says. 'Didn't care, don't care.'</p> <p>He did a few weeks of 'inspirational, amazing, amazing, wonderful, amazing' work experience at Kew Gardens - with one of Dr Cribb's colleagues - and then went to college to study tree surgery. The next three years were spent travelling through the Far East, Australia and America, looking for rare plants and, he admits, adventure. </p> <p>One trip - to find one of the only types of gum tree growing outside Australia - took him, alone, into the heart of the Muslim areas of the Philippines, close to where the Abu Sayyaf group of Islamic militants kidnapped a group of tourists last year. A search for a particular type of palm led on to mined beaches in Cambodia. He spent months on islands off Sumatra with people who had never seen white skin before. They looked after him when he was sick, which was apparently fairly often. </p> <p>And why the Darien Gap? 'Just fancied a poke about. Some amazing things there, amazing, amazing,' and he's off again, gabbling a stream of genera, species, habitats, colours.</p> <p>Slightly foolhardy, perhaps? He seems almost taken aback. 'Ooh no, we asked about - asked in the hotels and things. Heard a bit about the situation. Thought it was safe.' And, in the best British tradition, stumbled off into the unknown, anyway. </p> <p>The group that seized Tom and his friend, Paul Winder, were probably from the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (Farc) - the 15,000-strong left-wing guerrilla movement that has been fighting a brutal, filthy insurgency against the central government of Colombia for nearly 40 years. </p> <p>No one knows how many people have died in the violence - tens of thousands - though most agree that in recent years the violence has got worse. Assassinations and massacres by right-wing death squads have forced Farc groups into the more inhospitable areas of Colombia. In the last few years, discipline has begun to break down in the movement. There are now hundreds of armed groups, whose allegiance to the Farc commanders seems slight. One Farc group beheaded a 19-year-old Irish boy and his companion in central Colombia last year. It seems that a similar band seized Tom and Paul.</p> <p>The journey across the Darien Gap that the pair were attempting is feasible, if tough. It features in most backpackers' guidebooks to the region and should, in good conditions, take about seven days. There is a lot of hard walking along bad trails, and canoes are often the only way to travel. There are also snakes, ticks, leeches and an appalling variety of creatures that jump, crawl, bite, sting, infect and infest. The water is filthy. Diseases include malaria, dengue fever, leishmaniosis, hepatitis and typhoid. Without at least 10 litres of water a day you dehydrate, lapse into a coma and die. There are no communications, but that's not really an issue because there is no one to come and rescue you anyway. If you have a problem in the middle of the jungle, you might as well be on Mars. So it's generally a less-than-brilliant place to bump into a bunch of heavily armed renegades with a global reputation for kidnapping and murder.</p> <p>'What did you think when you saw the guerrillas?' I asked Tom.</p> <p>'Ooh, I thought, \"Amazing, oh no, incredible, amazing\".'</p> <p>And what about when you were lying on the ground tied up with your face in the dirt and a gun at your back?</p> <p>'Lord um er what did I think? </p> <p>I just thought um \"Oh bugger\" mmm... that was it - \"Oh bugger\".'</p> <p>For the next nine months, the pair were marched from camp to camp through the jungle, sometimes spending 30 successive days walking along rough jungle trails. Their captors never revealed their identities and never issued any coherent demands. </p> <p>'We tried to live off each other. There were low times, high times and terrifying times, as well as fantastic times. It was a huge roller-coaster of emotions,' Winder told a press conference, on his return.</p> <p>The guerrillas fed the two men on plantains and beef ('Amazing I put on weight,' says Tom), taught them rudimentary Spanish and constructed mats out of palm leaves to make them more comfortable. The guerrillas brought them orchids. As they didn't know where they were, their escape was hardly an issue.</p> <p>Then, on 10 December, the two men were told that they could leave. 'They said, \"Go, we don't need you any more\",' Tom remembers. There was no warning and little time to prepare anything. They were given 5,000 pesos (about \u00a31), a little food, a few old Coca-Cola bottles full of water and a machete, and then started walking.</p> <p>For five days they worked their way through thick forest, regrowth and deep swamps. Their drinking water was soon finished, so they took more from filthy, silt laden rivers. Their arms and legs were shredded by sharp leaves and thorns. On the sixth day, they broke through on to a track. They recognised it. They were back where they started. </p> <p>The guerrillas were not particularly pleased to see them again. </p> <p>'We said, \"Hi, how you doing?\" and had a cigarette and a drink and then they sent us out again,' Tom says. 'They told us they would kill us if they saw us again but then they were always saying that, so we weren't too bothered.'</p> <p>The guerrillas gave them better directions, though no map. This time they did better. Using a small Silva compass to guide them, they crossed a series of high ridges, followed river beds and some of the more beaten animal tracks. After three days, they reached a park ranger's office in Sautata in the Los Katios national park.</p> <p>Weak and confused, they told their story to the stunned ranger who contacted the British Embassy in Bogota and poured coffee down their throats and tried to force-feed them arepas, the local maize-flour cakes. A speedboat took them across the Gulf of Uraba to the rough little town of Turbo, from where they were flown, in a Red Cross jet and with a drip in their arms, to the capital. From the ambassador's residence they rang their parents. The calls came through at 3am UK time.</p> <p>These days, Tom Hart Dyke spends most of his days tending his beloved plants in the two small sheds in the Lullingstone Castle garden. He and Paul are working on a book about their time in Central America. Tom's not sure what he wants to do next. He's not so interested in the academic side of horticulture. He quite fancies a career in television. But most of all he wants to go back, to Papua New Guinea and Borneo and China and Cambodia and the crazy, untouched islands off the Sumatran coast and, of course, to the Darien Gap. Orchids, you see. Mad, you see. Quite mad.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Meet Tom. He's mad. Mad as a bat, as a badger, as a bag of spanners. In the nicest, most harmless way of course, but mad, barking, daft, tapped, a can short of a six pack, a ha'penny short of a shilling. He admits it, too. And that's the first step back to health. But Tom doesn't want to get better. He wants to convert the world, he wants everyone to share in his secret joy, he wants to broadcast his passion in the most flagrantly promiscuous way, he wants everyone to hear the voices that have spoken to him since he was very, very young. Tom Hart Dyke, a perfectly presentable 24-year-old from a small village in Kent, has no outward signs of delusion. But Tom is in love with plants. Not any old plants either, though he admits a yen for eucalypts and a soft spot for certain spiny shrubs. Tom is obsessed with flowers. But not any old flowers. Tom is in love with the royal family of the flower world. He is genuinely, deeply, tragically in love with orchids. And, as everybody knows, lunacy and love go hand in hand. Nearly a year ago Tom and a friend - Paul Winder, a merchant banker on a sabbatical from the City - hired two local guides and set off into the Darien Gap, a fetid, malaria-ridden slice of primary rainforest and swamp that straddles the borders of Panama and Colombia. Tom wanted to find rare orchids. His mate came along for a laugh. But, as swiftly became very clear, there aren't many laughs to be had in the Darien Gap. There are roads all the way from Alaska to southern Argentina - except for in the Darien Gap. There is, more or less, some kind of law and order, too - except in the Darien Gap. Its stinking thousand or so square miles of jungle act as a sump under the two continents it bisects. So, in addition to the many and varied natural hazards (more of these later), it is full of bandits, fugitives, drug traffickers, junkies, bounty hunters, renegades, left-wing guerrillas, right-wing death squads, killers who have found religion, priests who have lost their faith - and Tom, his mate Paul and a cheap Chinese tent. A road, shedding prosperity like a skin as it goes, coils down from the north through Central America. Yaviza - a small town with a few filthy hotels - is pretty much what you'd imagine would be at the wrong end of the American rainbow. Several trails lead off into the Darien Gap. One day in March last year, Tom Hart Dyke and his friend, full of bounce and brio, set off down one. Early on the third morning they saw that their guides, who had been a little ahead of them, had stopped and were standing very still. Among the undergrowth 10 yards away were a dozen figures in camouflage fatigues. There was a short conversation in rapid and heavily accented Spanish. Despite the gloom of the deep forest, the pair saw the guns that were pointed at them and raised their hands and dropped to their knees. Then they lay down with their faces in the dark, moist jungle earth. The guerrillas, covering them with M16s and handguns, tied their wrists together behind their backs. Around them, the forest hooted and shrilled and cawed and croaked. After half an hour, the guerrillas spoke directly to the two men for the first time. 'Are you going to run?' they asked. 'No' said Tom, and they were untied. The next time anyone heard from the pair was more than six months later. Tom may be in love with orchids but the feelings aroused in others are earthier. The very name is derived from orchis, the Greek for testicle, and refers not only to the shape of the plant's tubers but also to the long-held belief that orchids sprang from the spilled semen of mating animals. The Greeks believed that plant parts resembled the bodily part they could be used to treat. So, logically enough, they dried the tubers and used them to treat impotence. Some in the Far East still do this, though orchid tubers are a popular cure for bronchitis, too. A Herbal Guide, published in England in 1653, advised that orchids be treated with care: 'They are hot and moist in operation, under the dominion of Venus, and provoke lust exceedingly.' Even today, orchid lovers fervently splutter about a specimen's fine erect stamen, or luscious purple lips. Dr Phillip Cribb is curator of orchids at Kew Gardens. He may be a minor deity in the botanical world as a whole, but he is Jupiter in the orchid-lovers' pantheon. He is also modest and approachable. His analysis of the attraction of orchids is less Freudian. 'People love orchids because of their incredible diversity,' he says. 'They are the largest family of flowering plants. There could easily be 30,000, including some of the world's most beautiful flowers. There are many new species still to be discovered.' He's right about the variety. Some orchids weigh more than a tonne and spill out across a 100ft of forest, like a huge vine. The smallest is the size of a fingernail. Some smell wonderful. The carrion orchid doesn't. Some are extraordinary in their excess of colour, others are as drab as Charlie Dimmock's T-shirts. They grow in almost every climate, all over the world. What they all share is an identical structure - arranged symmetrically are two petals, two sepals in front of them and a lower leaf that usually curls and is known as the lip. They are designed to attract insects, thus the pornographically lurid hues. But if neither sex nor aesthetics draw you in, then social aspiration might. The Duke of Devonshire was one of the pioneers of the new 'orchid houses' and Queen Victoria was proud of her own collection. 'The orchid has always had a certain cachet,' says Dr Cribb. And they've always inspired obsession and craving. Victorians apparently confessed to suffering a general 'orchidelerium'. They were the ones who really got the orchid fad going. And the demand from newly enriched, newly leisured classes was insatiable. Big collectors dispatched orchid hunters throughout the world. Then, as now, novelty and exoticism drove the market, and buyers paid thousands of guineas in London salesrooms for the latest specimens wrenched from the earth of Sarawak, Brunei, Nepal or Arunachal Pradesh. The collectors sent out to foreign parts were not aristocrats. Instead, the British gentry - and many newly rich self-made men in the textile cities of the north - stayed home and dispatched their servants out into the wild to do the grubby job of dragging the plants from the soil. Many of the orchid-hunters paid with their lives. By the 1960s, commercial growers were mass-producing orchids for general consumption. But, though you can buy an orchid for a tenner at a garden centre, orchid fever is as fierce as ever. It's a \u00a37bn-a-year business. The best orchids have as refined a pedigree as any Cruft's winning dog and sell for as much as a small house in Leeds. Top orchid breeders' top plants are priceless. With any one flowering orchid capable of producing thousands of seedlings, a popular and productive mature plant is a licence to print money. And where there is money and obsession and beauty and exotic locations, there is - in the style of all good thrillers - crime. Keeping an eye on the old ladies with their Thermoses, the tweedy gents up from Buckinghamshire and the international criminal masterminds at Kew Gardens' annual orchid festival this year, were 14 police officers. They provided a 24-hour guard for the best orchids. The rest of the year, glass panels and CCTV do the job. Kew's orchids are among the best-guarded flowers in the world. So what are the police scared of? A Rafflesesque flower thief with an MG and a Mayfair flat? A Dome-style smash-and-grab tuber raid, complete with speedboat on the Thames, sawn-offs and dialogue from the Long Good Friday ('Shaddup, you long streak of paralysed paphiopedilum')? Charles McKay heads up Her Majesty's Customs and Excise 'Cites' (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) team at Heathrow. Under the convention, some rare species of orchid are proscribed - it is illegal to remove them from their habitats in the wild - others need permits in order to be transported and sold. Gram for gram, a very rare orchid can be worth more than Class A drugs. Last September, two of McKay's men inspected a shipment of orchids from Taiwan for a British professional grower. Packed in boxes in the airport freight terminal were plants with a retail value of \u00a360,000. Some had the necessary permits. Many didn't. The orchids, as experts at Kew confirmed, were indeed being smuggled. The consignment was confiscated, but no one was prosecuted. 'It's pretty hard to get hard evidence,' says McKay. The case was not unusual. The Cites team seizes thousands of orchids each year. The best-known orchid scandal is the case of Henry Azadehdel, a self-taught botanist and UFO fanatic from Nottingham. In 1986, after years of travelling through China, Malaysia, Borneo, Chile and Peru, Azadehdel was stopped at Heathrow with 15 undeclared plants from Chile in his luggage. He was accused of plundering endangered orchid species around the world, bringing at least one of them to the verge of extinction in its natural habitat, and brought to trial. Though he had a previously undiscovered orchid named after him in recognition of his legitimate work, he was alleged to have made \u00a3200,000 from smuggling and selling rare plants at the same time. One lady's slipper orchid, ripped from the ground in Borneo, was alleged to have been sold for \u00a316,000. When the police raided three greenhouses at Azadehdel's home they found 438 orchids, worth \u00a342,000, of which 334 were endangered species that had been 'jungle-collected'. The argument among orchid lovers is whether Azadehdel was a fanatic whose obsession had got out of control, or a ruthless exploiter of a fevered market. After inquiries all over the world, the Nottingham orchid buff went down for a 12-month sentence and got a \u00a320,000 fine. 'I don't want any part of it anymore,' said Azadehdel in an interview after his conviction. 'The orchid world is dirty.' So dirty that somewhere in the north of England, at a top-secret location known only to a few senior botanists, private security guards keep a watch on the last remaining specimen in the UK of a particular type of lady's slipper orchid. It had always been rare in Britain but a combination of avaricious amateur gardeners and the destruction of its natural habitat pushed it to the bring of extinction. For 80 years a single flowering plant held on - the sole survivor of the species. Then, a few years ago, experts managed to get seeds from it and raised thousands of seedlings in greenhouses. These are now being reintroduced to the wild and, last year, for the first time, one of the seedlings flowered in the wild. Like its parent plant, it had a slipper-shaped golden lip and petals that swept back and spiralled towards the ground and was very, very beautiful. 'It's terrible,' says Tom Hart Dyke shaking his head and grinning and hopping from one leg to the other. 'I mean it's bizarre, weird. I can't explain it. It's awful, terrible, and from such an early age. It is an obsession, an obsession - really only word for it.' And he shakes his head again and smiles beatifically. Tom is standing in his orchid sheds at the bottom of the garden of his parent's house. The gardens are 140 acres of prime Kentish countryside and the house is a gigantic 16th-century rambling pile called Lullingstone Castle. It has portraits of men in ruffs on the walls, roundheads' armour and one of the few remaining Tudor gatehouses in Britain. Tom is showing me a purple, yellow and white slipper orchid and is so excited that his knees are actually shaking. This is a man who, when he had an few hours stopover in Tokyo airport, spent it finding a janitor to open up the airport garden 'to see if there was anything interesting'. The flowers in his shed are wonderful and the orchid he is showing me is undeniably gorgeous but are, I can't help but think, only plants. Tom started on orchids when he was at primary school and he found them growing in the playground. His teenage years were spent dreaming, collecting, planning, growing plants. This is not normal, I point out, and he happily agrees. 'No, no, terrible - not normal at all. I didn't even know how to spell \"girls\",' he says. 'Didn't care, don't care.' He did a few weeks of 'inspirational, amazing, amazing, wonderful, amazing' work experience at Kew Gardens - with one of Dr Cribb's colleagues - and then went to college to study tree surgery. The next three years were spent travelling through the Far East, Australia and America, looking for rare plants and, he admits, adventure. One trip - to find one of the only types of gum tree growing outside Australia - took him, alone, into the heart of the Muslim areas of the Philippines, close to where the Abu Sayyaf group of Islamic militants kidnapped a group of tourists last year. A search for a particular type of palm led on to mined beaches in Cambodia. He spent months on islands off Sumatra with people who had never seen white skin before. They looked after him when he was sick, which was apparently fairly often. And why the Darien Gap? 'Just fancied a poke about. Some amazing things there, amazing, amazing,' and he's off again, gabbling a stream of genera, species, habitats, colours. Slightly foolhardy, perhaps? He seems almost taken aback. 'Ooh no, we asked about - asked in the hotels and things. Heard a bit about the situation. Thought it was safe.' And, in the best British tradition, stumbled off into the unknown, anyway. The group that seized Tom and his friend, Paul Winder, were probably from the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (Farc) - the 15,000-strong left-wing guerrilla movement that has been fighting a brutal, filthy insurgency against the central government of Colombia for nearly 40 years.

I asked Tom. 'Ooh, I thought, \"Amazing, oh no, incredible, amazing\".' And what about when you were lying on the ground tied up with your face in the dirt and a gun at your back? 'Lord um er what did I think? I just thought um \"Oh bugger\" mmm... that was it - \"Oh bugger\".'

Just Capital should become a New Labour 'must read'. He is for the free market, but without the slavish obsession of the true believer. With fact and logic, he destroys the ideologues of Anglo-Saxon Euroscepticism who take for granted the automatic superiority of the American model over the European. He rejects the argument of the Right that globalisation makes governments powerless to provide decent public services. He believes that markets, left to themselves, will not solve all the world's problems such as financial instability or environmental change. </p> <p>At the same time, competitive markets are the best route to higher productivity and living standards. I agree with him that the British Left has historically failed to appreciate markets and that market mechanisms can play a useful role in solving a variety of social and economic problems. Nevertheless, as a social democrat who believes that we are in politics principally to advance and equalise individual opportunity, I am not completely convinced by Turner's arguments. Where would I add grit to this appealing oyster of social liberalism? </p> <p>Like me, he believes in full employment. The key is to guarantee 'positive' labour-market flexibility. 'Flexibility' is not, however, a matter of employees fitting in with what management requires. Rather, it is firms setting working hours in accordance with the needs of markets and consumers, agreeing wages freely, and workers moving easily from one job or skill to the next, with minimum employment standards that do not discourage employers from creating jobs. </p> <p>It is Turner's view that society should minimise involuntary unemployment. It is legitimate for the individual to choose voluntary unemployment and to receive benefits instead of work. This is a liberal view of the relationship between individual liberty and the state. In contrast, social democrats would demand and expect more for people. There is a moral duty attached to work. A society where everyone who can work does work not only minimises waste and maximises prosperity, it offers the best conditions for genuine equality of opportunity. </p> <p>The challenge, however, is to provide a wider definition of what employment means. Social democrats have traditionally equated participation with the paid labour market. Yet there is non-paid work that should be considered legitimate. Caring, informal education and volunteering all enhance individual wellbeing and are good for society. An active welfare state designed to encourage people into work should recognise this. In its second term, New Labour has to broaden the scope of its 'welfare to work' policies. </p> <p>Turner is also too dismissive of the state's role in promoting national competitiveness. Just Capital accepts the traditional, neo-liberal view that the state should do nothing to influence where industries, sectors or firms choose to locate. If we examine what works in public policy, as Turner commends, a more balanced picture emerges. For example, would he have rejected the EU's decision to invest in Airbus, transforming the company into a world leader? Or investment to keep the Japanese car manufacturer Nissan located in the North-East of England? </p> <p>Governments exercise an important influence in promoting sectors or assisting business clusters, distinct from the policies of the 1960s and 1970s. Trying to pick winners or even reconstructing groups of companies to conform to a bureaucratic view of what makes commercial sense was conspicuously unsuccessful. It diminishes the efficiency of national economies. But this should not prevent investment in research and its commercial application that, in the long term, makes a country the world leader, especially in the knowledge economy, where sustained scientific research is necessary. </p> <p>Perhaps the most difficult aspect of Just Capital for social democrats is his dismissal of stakeholding. He argues that the Anglo-Saxon model of shareholder capitalism is probably better suited to the current period of rapid technological change. Stakeholding was the fashionable philosophy of the mid-1990s. Will Hutton's The State We're In offered an attractive deconstruction of free-market economics after the excesses of the 1980s. However, I now doubt the viability of stakeholding as a guide to policy. I accept the view that in a world where stocks are openly traded on the financial markets, firms are led to maximise shareholder value. </p> <p>Companies perform best where they work in social partnership with employees. But even if we tried to legislate for stakeholding, it is difficult to imagine how governments could alter corporate behaviour without drastic and unwieldy intervention. Yet if shareholder capitalism has triumphed in an era of global financial markets, this has major implications for those who actually live and work in the modern economy. It affects wage levels, the employment rights to which workers are entitled, working conditions, training, and how the work-life balance is managed. This raises some crucial questions. </p> <p>Turner's response is twofold. First, individuals are fundamentally self-interested, and ultimately, in his view, this is the best way to maximise economic efficiency and wealth creation. </p> <p>Second, those who want to build a responsible society should trust the state to redistribute income, and provide core public services. There is no contradiction between individuals who vote altruistically, yet behave self-interestedly in the marketplace. </p> <p>If Turner is right, as he may be, then the book is strangely neglectful of the role modern trade unionism could play in his liberal economy. He does acknowledge that if the Wilson government had succeeded with 'In Place of Strife' in 1969, British trade unions could have modernised and assumed a more constructive role. It was certainly a missed opportunity of historic proportions, but to argue that it has now gone forever is simply too pessimistic. </p> <p>Whether it is policies to promote full employment, creating the conditions in which enterprise can thrive in the knowledge economy or developing a role for modern trade unionism, we need a good dose of modern social democracy to help our country succeed.</p>",

The claim that Rousseau created the myth was made by one of the nineteenth century's most notorious racists to give weight to his belief in the notion of 'inferior' races, according to a new book, The Myth of the Noble Savage . Ter Ellingson, associate professor of anthropology at the University of Washington, believes the manipulation of the myth was part of a successful attempt by a faction of racist anthropologists to take over the anti-racist Ethnological Society in London in the late 1850s.

The term 'noble savage' was mentioned a handful of times before Rousseau, most notably by the poet and playwright John Dryden, but Ellingson maintains it had fallen out of use until reinvoked by the racist anthropologist John Crawfurd in 1859. By attributing the myth to Rousseau, Crawfurd gave the notion intellectual weight. 'The myth and the attribution of it to Rousseau was reintroduced by a racist faction in the Ethnological Society of London as part of a coup which aimed to divert the society from its anti-racist, pro-human rights roots,' said Ellingson.

The news comes as Cammell directors consider a management buyout of the UK business, which employs 1,800 workers at its Merseyside and Tyneside operations. Chairman Juan Kelly is keen for an MBO to succeed and held discussions last week with Edward Klempka, one of four receivers from accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers. Klempka, who said he was optimistic about selling the company as a going concern, told The Observer: 'Cammell Laird has a recent history of profitability and has an international following. I welcome the interest that has been shown from possible buyers or from an MBO.' Cammell has had problems since a contract to extend a liner for Italian firm Costa Crociere was terminated after it had spent \u00a340m. Its difficulties were heightened when it failed to clinch a contract to build two cruise ships worth $500m for operator Luxus. Kelly said: 'The market is there, the facilities are good, the workforce is good, as is the core of the management - an MBO would be a natural next step.' He is willing to take a role in a buyout, and other directors, including group managing director John Schofield, and Tyneside managing director David Skentelbery, are considering this option. Alchemy is a possible partner, although four venture capital firms are said to have made approaches. Left to sink in sea of debt",

Now it's a gap year - essential for the enterprising sixth-former - and it doesn't count unless you go somewhere very Third World. The gap-year phenomenon originated with the months left over to Oxbridge applicants between entrance exams in November and the start of the next academic year. Nowadays, Oxford and Cambridge make conditional offers before A-levels, like everyone else, but the gap year has exploded, becoming a kind of finishing school for the middle classes. One estimate puts the numbers taking such a break at between 100,000 and 200,000 a year. </p> <p>The notion that digging a well in Ethiopia is a valuable experience has been helped by backing from the Department for Education and Employment and Ucas, the university admissions service, both of which have endorsed the value of deferring entry to university. The internet has, meanwhile, given pupils greater access to organisations providing gap-year experiences. </p> <p>As a result, the number of gap-year providers has mushroomed into the hundreds. They offer expeditions, volunteering, work placements and cultural and language courses. Some are charities, others highly profitable companies. It is difficult to tell them apart at first sight - any sort of organisation can promise that you, like Prince William, can scrub floors in Chile - but they turn out to be very different. </p> <p>Lisa O'Donnelly applied to teach English in Ethiopia with a commercial provider. Unusually, she had more than one year off before starting at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London and already had a qualification in teaching English as a foreign language. When she arrived in Africa, she found there was no school and no one to teach. 'I was in a physiotherapy centre for children with polio from all over Ethiopia. It was a good project, but there was nothing there for me to do. In England, I was told I needed an induction, for which I was charged \u00a3250. It was mostly about teaching English and I didn't want to go, because I'd already taught for a year at this stage, in India and Nepal. </p> <p> 'There were two of us going to this project in Ethiopia, but a month beforehand the other girl dropped out. I was warned if I didn't go, I'd lose all my money. I was also told there would be a language induction in the first week, but the local representative put me in a hotel five miles outside Addis and then disappeared for seven days. When I complained, I was told I didn't understand the Third World. </p> <p>'The company claimed to have checked out the project, but it turned out that no one had been there. I paid \u00a3250 a month for a room on the project compound, even though my hotel had cost about 50p a night. I asked for a breakdown of the costs from the company, but they couldn't give me one. They said everything was admin.' </p> <p>Last week, O'Donnelly, who fought to get back the several thousand pounds she paid, spoke at a conference in Manchester organised by Tourism Concern aiming to bring together students and provider organisations, and to consider whether gap years are as good for dirt-poor destinations as for the young Brits who descend on them. </p> <p>Michael Lomotey, who is half-English, half-Ghanaian, organised the conference after being shocked by the behaviour of British gap-year students in Ghana. 'Their cultural insensitivity is incredible. They dress inappropriately, wearing shorts in the marketplace and they haggle without smiling. I've seen British gappers get into a fist fight with a taxi driver over the equivalent of 20p, which would matter to him, but not to them. </p> <p> 'On one flight out to Ghana, I travelled with 70 gappers. Most had received no training, no induction into the culture. I kept wondering if 10 of them were going to build a well and they'd each paid \u00a31,000, what could the community have done with that money?' </p> <p>Last May, 20 of the larger gap providers formed the Year Out Group, a trade association, in a bid to prevent the kind of experiences that Lisa had. The group now has 23 members and, according to its chief executive Richard Oliver, 'aims to agree standards and promote the benefits of a structured year out'. Its website offers a useful list of questions for students and parents: what exactly will I be doing? Is the host organisation paid? What are the hidden costs? And how will I be supported? </p> <p>As Lavinia Bristol, who runs Project Trust, one of the best gap-year organisations, says: 'Eighteen-year-olds are extraordinarily bad at being discerning consumers. Even on our selection courses, they don't ask questions that you'd think might be obvious, such as how they're going to be looked after or how the project's been vetted.' </p> <p>But more radical critics, like Jim Cogan, founder of Student Partnerships Worldwide, one of the oldest and most distinguished organisations, question whether gap years in poor countries are of any benefit. 'The danger is that if untrained British students go out to poor countries that are riddled with disease and malnutrition, they are likely to end up debauching themselves by the ocean or on the shores of Lake Malawi in little hedonistic enclaves. They can enjoy the cheap cost of living, have an interesting four months and come home. There is a big moral issue here, which is conveniently being overlooked.' </p> <p>The trouble is that there are many different kinds of gap-year provider, some with more honourable intentions than others. On the one hand, there are organisa tions such as Project Trust, a charity that took over Voluntary Service Overseas' 18-year-olds programme, and selects its 200 participants on the basis of a five-day assessment on the Isle of Coll in Scotland. It provides a week-long training course and sends gappers to their projects for an entire year. Student Partnerships Worldwide trains 250 British students alongside the same number of young people from host countries for a month and specialises in teaching adolescents in countries with high levels of Aids and HIV how to avoid infection. </p> <p>On the other hand, Teaching and Projects Abroad is a commercial company. Its 1,000 students can decide when they want to go and for how long. The question then arises: how different is this from an ordinary tour company? And if students can dip in and out of the projects, how important are the jobs they are doing? </p> <p>Kevin Dynan, in charge of recruitment for the company (which would probably be called marketing elsewhere), points out reasonably enough that not all gappers are ready to make the 12-month commitment required by some organisations. 'With us, they go initially for three months, which is long enough to stick it out and also to make some contribution.' He says there is some in-country induction, and in areas where cultural faux pas are a real risk, 'we might have a chat with people before they go'. </p> <p>He acknowledges that there are periods when no one is filling the posts, 'but in teaching, it's not necessarily a problem, as they're very much language assistants. Other projects are more about training - shadowing a doctor or working in a radio station'. And what's the difference between them and a holiday company? 'We're not interested in making huge amounts of profit.' </p> <p>It is, in fact, extremely difficult to compare the costs of different organisations, because advertised prices often don't include airfares, insurance, pocket money or language and induction programmes and cover different periods of time. As a general rule, expeditions are more expensive than volunteering or work placements, and you are unlikely to get away with much under \u00a33,000. Lavinia Bristol of Project Trust has attempted to calculate relative costs and concluded that Gap is the cheapest (with Project Trust next) and something called, improbably, Ski Le Gap is the most expensive. </p> <p>Not least thanks to cheap flights and a better travelled population, the popularity of gap years looks set only to rise.

Then Coventry City intervened, folding in the last eight minutes to clear the way. </p> <p>It still needed a long shot to confirm the title - the unlikely scenario that Arsenal would fail against lowly Middlesbrough at Highbury. But they did - and so the gift of a third consecutive title, and a seventh in nine seasons, was complete. </p> <p>Knowing that there was an off-chance of Premiership glory should have made United keener. Instead there was a sloppiness to them, certainly in defence, to alarm for the make-or-break Champions League match in Munich on Wednesday. Perhaps the luxury of being unchallenged at the top for so long has caused it. 'They like to keep you waiting,' was Sir Alex Ferguson's explanation. 'It's good for you.' </p> <p>Not so good for Coventry. Gordon Strachan was punished mercilessly for reshaping the side with substitutions at a time when his team were holding their own. It does not bode well for their relegation struggle that they can play so well and still be beaten, even if it was by Manchester United. Typically of sides who go down, two moments of wandering concentration undermined much good work. </p> <p>'We were tiring and I wanted to stop them getting in crosses,' said Strachan of his changes. 'But you can talk about tactics all you want, it's the quality of players you can bring on that count.' In United's case, David Beckham was among those who appeared. 'They tire you out for 80 minutes then play on your tiredness,' added Strachan. 'Sometimes it's players' minds, not their bodies, that get tired.' </p> <p>There was a weary resignation after the game's decisive score, a remarkable header by Ryan Giggs, with the score level after the potent John Hartson and Dwight Yorke had swapped a brace of goals.

      "bodyText": "For much of the time, Manchester United played as if they didn't really want to win the championship yesterday, as if they had caught the mood of their fans, who would have delighted in the prospect of it being confirmed here next Saturday against a Manchester City they could also help on their way down. Then Coventry City intervened, folding in the last eight minutes to clear the way. It still needed a long shot to confirm the title - the unlikely scenario that Arsenal would fail against lowly Middlesbrough at Highbury. But they did - and so the gift of a third consecutive title, and a seventh in nine seasons, was complete. Knowing that there was an off-chance of Premiership glory should have made United keener. Instead there was a sloppiness to them, certainly in defence, to alarm for the make-or-break Champions League match in Munich on Wednesday. Perhaps the luxury of being unchallenged at the top for so long has caused it. 'They like to keep you waiting,' was Sir Alex Ferguson's explanation. 'It's good for you.' Not so good for Coventry. Gordon Strachan was punished mercilessly for reshaping the side with substitutions at a time when his team were holding their own. It does not bode well for their relegation struggle that they can play so well and still be beaten, even if it was by Manchester United. Typically of sides who go down, two moments of wandering concentration undermined much good work. 'We were tiring and I wanted to stop them getting in crosses,' said Strachan of his changes. 'But you can talk about tactics all you want, it's the quality of players you can bring on that count.' In United's case, David Beckham was among those who appeared. 'They tire you out for 80 minutes then play on your tiredness,' added Strachan. 'Sometimes it's players' minds, not their bodies, that get tired.' There was a weary resignation after the game's decisive score, a remarkable header by Ryan Giggs, with the score level after the potent John Hartson and Dwight Yorke had swapped a brace of goals. 'He'll never score a header like that again,' lamented Strachan of the 'body blow'. Indeed, it capped a dynamic display by Giggs, back to his vivacious best after a period of injury. 'If we get that from Ryan on Wednesday, we've got a chance against anyone,' said Ferguson of United's European Cup semi-final, second leg against Bayern Munich.

Such risks are as 'endogenous' to the global system as the long-term growth he seeks. So he will be advocating a two-pronged strategy in Washington - regulatory reform and global trade.

      "body": "<p>On a sunny afternoon in April, when the bracken cloak around the fells is showing the year's first green and the valley seems to rumble with the murmur of pregnant ewes, Millbeck farm in Langdale seems far too peaceful a place to be a battlefield. Its old stone buildings stand near the hub of the central knot of Lakeland fells: miles of mountains on all sides. Their protection is illusory. As foot and mouth creeps ever nearer, northward over Crinkle Crags from the slaughtered flocks of the Duddon valley; down via Borrowdale from the infected flanks of Skiddaw, Millbeck is on the front line of a culture war.</p> <p>At Millbeck, and at thousands of small-to-medium sized farms across the country where the soil is tilled and animals raised in ways which seem to be timeless, the unequal fight against the virus masks a deeper struggle. Foot and mouth, and the chaotic, bloodstained means by which the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Maff) has chosen to try to contain it, have hastened the outbreak of this battle, and may already have determined its outcome.</p> <p>On one side lies agribusiness: the transnational, commercialised world of the East Anglian 'barley barons' with their quasi-prairies, enemies of biodiversity; the folks who brought you BSE through their industrial cultivation of meat. These are the men who have long dominated the national council of the National Farmers' Union, and through it, wielded overwhelming influence in Maff.</p> <p>It was this which caused the two signal policy errors at the outset of the crisis and turned it into a catastrophe - the ruling out of even limited vaccination, and, as NFU president Ben Gill urged on 22 February, the issuing of advice designed to make people 'stay away from the countryside'. (Finally, eight weeks too late, the Culture Secretary Chris Smith admitted last Friday that the latter policy had been a mistake.)</p> <p>Last week, Tony Blair appeared to indicate that his strategic vision for the future was to give yet more power to this camp. 'The Government plans a major reduction in the number of farms and farmers as part of a recovery package [sic] for British agriculture in the wake of the devastating foot and mouth outbreak,' said one newspaper story. Ministers expected the number of farms to fall by at least 25,000 by 2005, with 50,000 people forced to leave the industry. Maff - who else? - was about to publish three 'major reports' arguing big farms were more productive, and better able to compete with their counterparts in the Pampas and American Midwest.</p> <p>On the other side are people like the Taylforths: people who find it far from easy to turn a bottom-line profit even in good times, despite hefty subsidy. The rhetoric of this underlying struggle sounds eerily familiar. Uneconomic farms, uneconomic pits: the language of Maff and the NFU leadership is the language of Margaret Thatcher, circa 1984, as she prepared to deal with her 'enemy within'.</p> <p>But before we hand victory to the side with power and influence and seemingly impeccable financial logic, we ought at least to pause. The social devastation in many former mining areas is still palpable - the Welsh valleys, for example, once proud bastions of sport, music and intellectual endeavour, have been ravaged by crime, unemployment and drugs. Most of us, however, barely notice the virtual demise of the coal industry, other than that our air and buildings are cleaner. The consequences of small farming's collapse may be more visible and keenly felt - not just by farmers, but by everyone who uses the countryside: as tourists and providers of tourism; as ramblers, climbers, and picnickers, those of us who love the land of Wordsworth, Ruskin and Constable; as consumers of food.</p> <p>After 21 years in Langdale, Eric and Susan Taylforth are facing up to the strong possibility that they will be Millbeck's last tenants. So far, only six of their 2,500 sheep have been killed - beasts who made the mistake of straying across the watershed into Duddon, where the slaughtermen were waiting. But whether or not the disease eventually infects the rest of their pedigree Herdwick flock, the virus, coupled with Maff's control measures, is set to ruin them nevertheless.</p> <p>Across the table in the room that serves as his lounge and office, Eric Taylforth explained the human and financial sides to the emerging catastrophe. He had spent the winter rearing 60 cattle which he should have sold a month ago. Because of the disease, he had been unable to move them: 'Instead of getting that income, I'm paying for their feed and housing. I don't have the pasture to put them out to grass. There's no prospect of getting rid of them for at least six months.'</p> <p>He also had 250 of last year's Herdwick lambs ready for sale. They, too, could not be moved. Another 350 fattening 'Gimmer hogs' had wintered on a farm in the north of the county where the disease has been at its worst: caught within a three-kilometre cull zone near a case of infection, their lives have been spared so far only because Mr Taylforth has exercised his right of appeal. All 60 of his young breeding tups (rams) were in the same position, awaiting confirmation of their death sentence in another cull zone outside Carlisle.</p> <p>He bought 11 of these animals only last year: they cost more than \u00a31,000 each. The rest of his stock was on the fells, mingling in their immemorial way with animals from other farms and valleys. Three weeks ago, vaccination would have saved them. Now, with 900 of them about to give birth, rounding them up to administer the vaccine would probably prove impossible.</p> <p>The potential loss here goes far beyond one family's livelihood and a few thousand sheep. The agricultural archaeologists of the National Trust believe that the direct ancestors of the Taylforths' Herdwicks were roaming the same unfenced 'heaf', the rugged tract from Pavey Ark and Harrison Stickle down to the top of Grasmere, by the start of the fifteenth century at the latest; they may have been there around the turn of the last millennium. Once the present generation falls prey to the bolt gun, or their masters to the plague's brutal economics, it is difficult to see how either can be replaced, even if the Herdwick bloodlines can somehow be preserved.</p> <p>Heafed flocks stay on the hills through a homing instinct ingrained over centuries.

That's what this crisis is really about. For myself, the fact that I'm sitting here at the mercy of the virus in a modern society which is letting millions of animals be slaughtered with no end in sight is beyond belief.'</p> <p>Time and again over the past fortnight, as I talked to farmers, hoteliers, the people who run tourist attractions and some of the vast numbers whose principal recreation is to be outdoors, I encountered the same emotions: a howling, pent-up mixture of anger and despair - as Eric Taylforth put it, 'you just don't know whether to weep or scream or with rage'. Outside the Whitehall bubble, awareness is growing that once again, New Labour is trying to spin its way out of trouble.</p> <p>But foot and mouth is not like the rows over Bernie Ecclestone of Formula One or the problems of Peter Mandelson. This is real: costing billions, and grossly affecting the basic freedoms and quality of life enjoyed by millions of citizens.</p> <p>The bad news for the Government is that people are beginning to realise they have been deceived. Why, for example, did Maff stop publishing the totals of animals killed and awaiting slaughter last week? Maff claims it was because the figures might be 'inaccurate'. Partly because, as Maff admitted on Friday, the number of animals awaiting slaughter in the so-called firebreaks around infected farms had more than doubled to more almost 540,000, so negating the policy's basic rationale. There was another reason. At the start of the public holiday, the slaughter total will have passed one million - an Easter headline Blair wished to avoid. By the time the epidemic is over, it is certain to be more than double, maybe even triple this figure - at least five times the number killed in the last foot and mouth outbreak of 1967-68.</p> <p>Upbeat assessments from the Chief Scientific Adviser, David King, that the plague has 'passed its peak' have become a regular feature of the foot and mouth media week. On the ground, his optimism appears inexplicable. Farmer after farmer pointed out that the basis of his predictions, the number of new cases notified, took no account of the new 3km cull policy, which could engulf literally dozens of farms around a single proven case of infection. Last week, when a case appeared miles from other outbreaks in Jedburgh in Scotland, animals from 26 neighbouring farms were slaughtered too: many of these may already have been harbouring the disease, but did not get into the figures.</p> <p>However fierce the spin, the inescapable, underlying horror becomes more apparent with each passing day. Will Cockbain, who waits, powerless, for the virus to cross the River Greta and erase his Swaledales from the hills above Derwent Water, put it very simply: 'The slaughter policy hasn't worked, isn't working. The price is far too high. If it does eventually stop the disease, there may not be any livestock left. If this is the best way to beat the virus, I would hate to see the alternative.'</p> <p>Cockbain is a regional representative of the NFU, and his views run directly counter to the union's national leadership, whose support for slaughter - motivated by an increasingly surreal desire for an early return to live animal exports - remains undiminished. But as he points out, having come this far, Maff, its Minister, Nick Brown, and the NFU will find it very difficult not to stick to their bolt guns. For the advocates of slaughter, the consequences of admitting there might have been a far less damaging alternative in the shape of early vaccination are too terrible to contemplate. Cockbain said: 'They're scared to go down the vaccination route because they're frightened it might actually work.'</p> <p>Thus far, the only official answer to the failure of killing is to call for more killing - exactly the position stated by a team of scientists from Imperial College who have been advising the Government throughout, and who produced a study last Wednesday which concluded: 'Extensive culling is the only option for controlling the current British epidemic.' Echoes of Thatcher again: 'There is no alternative.' By the end of the week, even these optimists were betraying their unease. The lengthening delays to killing animals in the 'firebreaks' meant a third of British livestock might have to die.</p> <p>Early on Wednesday evening came the first signs of what might yet become a U-turn to end U-turns. As I sat in the Taylforths' parlour in Langdale, the fax machine chattered into life. It was an urgent 'priority message' from David MacLean, the Tory MP for Penrith and the Border, seeking farmers' views of a new proposal which had just been put to him by Brown. The Minister had asked him to garner views on the 'possibility of vaccinating all cattle herds, but not to slaughter them eventually', using 'the latest American-style vaccine' which would grant protection almost at once. These animals' meat and milk would be fit for human consumption, and 12 months after the last shot were administered Britain could begin exporting again.</p> <p>Twelve hours after making his appeal, MacLean had hundreds of responses, 'overwhelmingly in favour' of vaccination. Only the big-time cattle breeders and exporters remained opposed. His impression was that Brown was serious about the idea, and 'using me as a bit of political cover - why else would he consult an Opposition MP?' Yesterday, however, Maff was insisting this was only another 'review', not a prelude to a new policy. Half a million vaccine doses could be administered almost immediately. As Cumbria's bovines emerge from the protection of winter quarters on to grass, every hour's delay means more burning carcasses.</p> <p>Meanwhile, around Longtown, whose border market was the origin and epicentre of the plague in Cumbria and southern Scotland, residents have already endured some 700 pyres. Last week I watched as a pyre was lit for 2,000 animals slaughtered at Spray House farm on the slopes of Kinder Scout.</p> <p>The fires are fuelled by cheap coal and railway sleepers, coated in creosote: when it burns, it produces eight carcinogenic compounds, including dioxins. Some of the other effects of the pyres were described at a public meeting in Longtown last Wednesday night. Residents described how chunks of half-burnt skin had wafted into their homes on the breeze. Peter Tiplady, North Cumbria's director of public health, admitted some of the cows burnt at Longtown were 'likely' to have had BSE.</p> <p>MAFF has already poured \u00a32 million into building a giant pyre at Longtown which was supposed to burn for months. As a result of the meeting, it may never be lit. Yet the Ministry is pressing ahead with a similar plan near Petrockstowe in Devon. Stand by for the first investigative documentary about childhood deformities and cancers, and huge claims for damages in the courts.</p> <p>On the question of whether we might have avoided this disaster by early vaccination, and the alleged inevitability of slaughter, Maff's spin shades into out right disinformation. Among the claims fed to the media since the crisis began are the following: that vaccine is prohibitively expensive; that it takes 14 days to protect an animal against the virus; that the present 'O-Pan-Asia' foot and mouth strain is unusually virulent and likely to render vaccine ineffective; and that resuming exports would be difficult or impossible because there is no test to distinguish between an animal which has been vaccinated and one which harbours the disease. Not one of them is true.</p> <p>In the course of an admirably candid interview, one of the Government's most senior advisors, Professor Chris Bostock, director of the Institute of Animal Health, demolished all these claims. Bostock suspects that by the time the outbreak became apparent in February, it had already spread too far for vaccine to have stopped an epidemic, although its adoption early on 'might have slowed the spread of the disease'. But vaccination by Maff would not cost farmers a penny, he said; the actual cost was probably about \u00a35 per shot. The vaccine held in his institute's bank at Pirbright was a high-dose type which would provide six months' protection within about three days. O Pan-Asia was no more virulent than other strains, merely rather preva lent over the past few years. And although they have not yet been approved by the international veterinary body, the Organisation Internationale des Epizooties, there are tests which can tell vaccine and disease antibodies apart.</p> <p>The most shocking thing is that contrary to Maff spin, if we had adopted vaccination at the start of the outbreak, we would merely have been carrying out official EU scientific policy. In March 1999, the European Commission adopted the Strategy for Emergency Vaccination against Foot and Mouth Disease, the work of its scientific committee on animal health and welfare. Vaccination, the report said, can achieve several objectives: a reduction in numbers of infected animals; the slowing of the spread of the disease; the reduction of economic loss. It also set out criteria for when this would be the best course to adopt, many of which were clearly met in Britain when the epidemic was beginning: a high density of animals in affected areas; evidence of widespread animal movement; a suitable vaccine available; a steeply rising incidence of cases.</p> <p>There are eminent British scientists who agree. Professor Derek Ellwood lives on the shore of Derwent Water. The former director of the Government's pathenogenic microbe lab at Porton Down, he has worked with deadly human viruses such as Ebola and HIV, and he is scathing about the way the epidemic ran out of control. 'There was no proper, open debate about what to do, especially over vaccines. The scale of the outbreak could have been massively reduced, and there would have been no need for many of the Draconian measures which have been introduced.' His own research leads him to conclude that airborne spread is far easier than Maff will allow - suggesting the effectiveness of slaughter will always be very limited.</p> <p>So why did Maff and Brown so easily disregard all this advice? Partly, perhaps, for cultural reasons: as the historian Michael Worboys points out in his book Spreading Germs , slaughter, rather than vaccination or treatment, has been the preferred way to deal with livestock illness since the cattle plague of 1865. But also, inevitably, because of the power of agribusiness. The NFU ensured that when vaccination might have been seriously effective, in the last week of February, it was not seriously considered. A fortnight ago, when Brown was last dithering over whether to authorise vaccination, he was headed off again by the NFU. Its deputy director general, Ian Gardiner, insisted 'we are moving into the endgame'. In Cumbria, Devon, Dumfries and Gloucestershire last week, that was beginning to look like a criminal delusion.</p> <p>And so it is that over the length of Britain we begin to count a vast and rising cost, and the despair and anger mount. However shrill Ministers' insistence that the countryside is open for business, it is barely open at all, even in areas without a single case of foot and mouth. I spent a fine but dismal day just before the holiday weekend touring the Peak District national park. At Speedwell Cavern in Castleton, at the head of Hope Valley, the queue would normally have been snaking up the hill, with a minimum two-hour wait. The car park was empty. Normally, the village pavements would have been overflowing. In one gift shop, where turnover was down more than 90 per cent, the owner, Pam Oldfield, wept openly when I asked how things were going. 'I put everything I had into this, and I love it, love it, the buying and the selling, it's great. But you can't just sit here and not pay your rent.'</p> <p>Down the valley in Hathersage, Dick Turnbull has spent 17 years building up Outside, a chain of three walkers' and climbers' shops employing 30 people. Mr Turnbull reckons he will have lost \u00a3250,000 by the end of Easter. He is a determined man, who has climbed all the great Alpine north faces in winter: unwilling to capitulate, he has put his house up as collateral for an extended loan.</p> <p>The Hope Valley is being ruined because every moor and footpath and almost every crag in the Peak national park is closed. At Ringinglow, overlooking Sheffield, sheep wander freely over the open moorland road. There you can legally stop, even give these beasts a sandwich. Stray on to a public footpath or a wall of heather-framed gritstone, however, and you could be fined \u00a35,000. In parts of the Scottish Highlands, meanwhile, on open land with just as many animals there is still a right to roam.</p> <p>Where is the logic, the scientifically based risk assessment one would assume had been done to justify these restrictions? I asked their Peak District architect, John Lomas, the national park's chief conservation officer. He admitted there was none. He had not consulted a single scientist about the real risk of walkers or climbers spreading the disease in an area where there had been no outbreaks. He knew that Maff had now issued guidance stating that paths which avoided livestock and open moors should be reopened, but he had done a risk assessment of his own, based on local knowledge and talking to his rangers. His conclusion was that it was still too risky because it was impossible to separate paths which crossed arable land from those which went near grazing, while Peak District sheep were 'unusually friendly'. Small wonder, perhaps, that the internet is humming with the protests of climbers and walkers who are beginning to think of challenging the restrictions with a mass trespass. I ran Lomas's logic past Professor Bostock. The risk of walkers spreading the disease was 'negligible,' he said.</p> <p>Last night I spoke to Eric Taylforth again. 'They're still saying on the news that the worst is over,' he said, and chuckled grimly. 'They should come up here. Of course, if we close, there's no one going to take our place. That's the end of this farm. Big business doesn't want to know about Herdwick hill farming.'</p> <p>If he and thousands of other small farmers do close, the British countryside is going to change in ways that are permanent. When one has been away for a while it's easy to forget just how beautiful Lakeland is. What makes it unique is the way its grandeur has been softened, blurred at the edges, by the interaction between nature and human beings.</p> <p>That is now in jeopardy: as A. Harry Griffin, the veteran Guardian country diarist wrote last week, the end of the Herdwicks will swiftly create a dystopia of broken walls, and rampant gorse, juniper and bog. The new leaves on the trees deceive us. Across most of Britain, spring has been cancelled.</p> <p><b>then and now</b><br></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Agriculture has declined from being 3 per cent of national gross domestic product in 1975 to just 1 per cent.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Over the same period, farms and herds have got bigger in size as smallholdings have become less economically viable. Pig farmers in 1978 kept an average of 200 animals. By 1998 that figure was 500.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Farms have also become more productive, with a smaller number of workers. In 1974 Britain produced 160 tonnes of wheat a hectare, compared with just 100 in 1974. But during the same period the rural workforce shrank from about 600,000 to 390,000.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Government figures expect the trend to bigger farms and fewer workers will continue. By 2005, 50,000 more workers will have left farming and 25 per cent of farms will have closed or merged with their neighbours.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On a sunny afternoon in April, when the bracken cloak around the fells is showing the year's first green and the valley seems to rumble with the murmur of pregnant ewes, Millbeck farm in Langdale seems far too peaceful a place to be a battlefield. Its old stone buildings stand near the hub of the central knot of Lakeland fells: miles of mountains on all sides. Their protection is illusory. As foot and mouth creeps ever nearer, northward over Crinkle Crags from the slaughtered flocks of the Duddon valley; down via Borrowdale from the infected flanks of Skiddaw, Millbeck is on the front line of a culture war. At Millbeck, and at thousands of small-to-medium sized farms across the country where the soil is tilled and animals raised in ways which seem to be timeless, the unequal fight against the virus masks a deeper struggle. Foot and mouth, and the chaotic, bloodstained means by which the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Maff) has chosen to try to contain it, have hastened the outbreak of this battle, and may already have determined its outcome. On one side lies agribusiness: the transnational, commercialised world of the East Anglian 'barley barons' with their quasi-prairies, enemies of biodiversity; the folks who brought you BSE through their industrial cultivation of meat. These are the men who have long dominated the national council of the National Farmers' Union, and through it, wielded overwhelming influence in Maff. It was this which caused the two signal policy errors at the outset of the crisis and turned it into a catastrophe - the ruling out of even limited vaccination, and, as NFU president Ben Gill urged on 22 February, the issuing of advice designed to make people 'stay away from the countryside'. (Finally, eight weeks too late, the Culture Secretary Chris Smith admitted last Friday that the latter policy had been a mistake.) Last week, Tony Blair appeared to indicate that his strategic vision for the future was to give yet more power to this camp. 'The Government plans a major reduction in the number of farms and farmers as part of a recovery package [sic] for British agriculture in the wake of the devastating foot and mouth outbreak,' said one newspaper story. Ministers expected the number of farms to fall by at least 25,000 by 2005, with 50,000 people forced to leave the industry. Maff - who else? - was about to publish three 'major reports' arguing big farms were more productive, and better able to compete with their counterparts in the Pampas and American Midwest. On the other side are people like the Taylforths: people who find it far from easy to turn a bottom-line profit even in good times, despite hefty subsidy. The rhetoric of this underlying struggle sounds eerily familiar. Uneconomic farms, uneconomic pits: the language of Maff and the NFU leadership is the language of Margaret Thatcher, circa 1984, as she prepared to deal with her 'enemy within'. But before we hand victory to the side with power and influence and seemingly impeccable financial logic, we ought at least to pause. The social devastation in many former mining areas is still palpable - the Welsh valleys, for example, once proud bastions of sport, music and intellectual endeavour, have been ravaged by crime, unemployment and drugs. Most of us, however, barely notice the virtual demise of the coal industry, other than that our air and buildings are cleaner. The consequences of small farming's collapse may be more visible and keenly felt - not just by farmers, but by everyone who uses the countryside: as tourists and providers of tourism; as ramblers, climbers, and picnickers, those of us who love the land of Wordsworth, Ruskin and Constable; as consumers of food. After 21 years in Langdale, Eric and Susan Taylforth are facing up to the strong possibility that they will be Millbeck's last tenants. So far, only six of their 2,500 sheep have been killed - beasts who made the mistake of straying across the watershed into Duddon, where the slaughtermen were waiting. But whether or not the disease eventually infects the rest of their pedigree Herdwick flock, the virus, coupled with Maff's control measures, is set to ruin them nevertheless. Across the table in the room that serves as his lounge and office, Eric Taylforth explained the human and financial sides to the emerging catastrophe. He had spent the winter rearing 60 cattle which he should have sold a month ago. Because of the disease, he had been unable to move them: 'Instead of getting that income, I'm paying for their feed and housing. I don't have the pasture to put them out to grass. There's no prospect of getting rid of them for at least six months.' He also had 250 of last year's Herdwick lambs ready for sale. They, too, could not be moved. Another 350 fattening 'Gimmer hogs' had wintered on a farm in the north of the county where the disease has been at its worst: caught within a three-kilometre cull zone near a case of infection, their lives have been spared so far only because Mr Taylforth has exercised his right of appeal. All 60 of his young breeding tups (rams) were in the same position, awaiting confirmation of their death sentence in another cull zone outside Carlisle. He bought 11 of these animals only last year: they cost more than \u00a31,000 each. The rest of his stock was on the fells, mingling in their immemorial way with animals from other farms and valleys. Three weeks ago, vaccination would have saved them. Now, with 900 of them about to give birth, rounding them up to administer the vaccine would probably prove impossible. The potential loss here goes far beyond one family's livelihood and a few thousand sheep. The agricultural archaeologists of the National Trust believe that the direct ancestors of the Taylforths' Herdwicks were roaming the same unfenced 'heaf', the rugged tract from Pavey Ark and Harrison Stickle down to the top of Grasmere, by the start of the fifteenth century at the latest; they may have been there around the turn of the last millennium. Once the present generation falls prey to the bolt gun, or their masters to the plague's brutal economics, it is difficult to see how either can be replaced, even if the Herdwick bloodlines can somehow be preserved. Heafed flocks stay on the hills through a homing instinct ingrained over centuries. 'I remember a friend of mine who bought a lot of new sheep to enlarge his hill-flock and put them on the fells,' said John Metcalfe of the National Trust. 'They just started drifting down again, trying to get back to where they'd come from.' The tragedy is that despite the length of their farm's tradition, the Taylforths have adapted it in the best, sustainable, twenty-first-century manner. Together with four other farmers, they have formed a direct sale co-operative, supplying personal customers, specialist butchers, high-quality restaurants and a specialist market in London. Aware of a link between farming and tourism which is as organic as the meat the Taylforths produce, the couple run a bed-and-breakfast business and two holiday villas. At what should be the busiest time of year, both are empty. ' 'Our income is zero,' Eric Taylforth said. 'Just to keep the animals fed we've had to increase our overdraft by \u00a330,000. On this basis, we can't carry on. The people of this country have got to make a decision: do they want good quality food produced on farms like ours or the mass-produced food which will throw up problems like BSE and genetic modification at regular intervals. That's what this crisis is really about. For myself, the fact that I'm sitting here at the mercy of the virus in a modern society which is letting millions of animals be slaughtered with no end in sight is beyond belief.' Time and again over the past fortnight, as I talked to farmers, hoteliers, the people who run tourist attractions and some of the vast numbers whose principal recreation is to be outdoors, I encountered the same emotions: a howling, pent-up mixture of anger and despair - as Eric Taylforth put it, 'you just don't know whether to weep or scream or with rage'. Outside the Whitehall bubble, awareness is growing that once again, New Labour is trying to spin its way out of trouble. But foot and mouth is not like the rows over Bernie Ecclestone of Formula One or the problems of Peter Mandelson. This is real: costing billions, and grossly affecting the basic freedoms and quality of life enjoyed by millions of citizens. The bad news for the Government is that people are beginning to realise they have been deceived. Why, for example, did Maff stop publishing the totals of animals killed and awaiting slaughter last week? Maff claims it was because the figures might be 'inaccurate'.

Last week, when a case appeared miles from other outbreaks in Jedburgh in Scotland, animals from 26 neighbouring farms were slaughtered too: many of these may already have been harbouring the disease, but did not get into the figures. However fierce the spin, the inescapable, underlying horror becomes more apparent with each passing day. Will Cockbain, who waits, powerless, for the virus to cross the River Greta and erase his Swaledales from the hills above Derwent Water, put it very simply: 'The slaughter policy hasn't worked, isn't working.

The former director of the Government's pathenogenic microbe lab at Porton Down, he has worked with deadly human viruses such as Ebola and HIV, and he is scathing about the way the epidemic ran out of control. 'There was no proper, open debate about what to do, especially over vaccines. The scale of the outbreak could have been massively reduced, and there would have been no need for many of the Draconian measures which have been introduced.' His own research leads him to conclude that airborne spread is far easier than Maff will allow - suggesting the effectiveness of slaughter will always be very limited. So why did Maff and Brown so easily disregard all this advice? Partly, perhaps, for cultural reasons: as the historian Michael Worboys points out in his book Spreading Germs , slaughter, rather than vaccination or treatment, has been the preferred way to deal with livestock illness since the cattle plague of 1865. But also, inevitably, because of the power of agribusiness. The NFU ensured that when vaccination might have been seriously effective, in the last week of February, it was not seriously considered. A fortnight ago, when Brown was last dithering over whether to authorise vaccination, he was headed off again by the NFU. Its deputy director general, Ian Gardiner, insisted 'we are moving into the endgame'. In Cumbria, Devon, Dumfries and Gloucestershire last week, that was beginning to look like a criminal delusion. And so it is that over the length of Britain we begin to count a vast and rising cost, and the despair and anger mount. However shrill Ministers' insistence that the countryside is open for business, it is barely open at all, even in areas without a single case of foot and mouth. I spent a fine but dismal day just before the holiday weekend touring the Peak District national park. At Speedwell Cavern in Castleton, at the head of Hope Valley, the queue would normally have been snaking up the hill, with a minimum two-hour wait. The car park was empty. Normally, the village pavements would have been overflowing. In one gift shop, where turnover was down more than 90 per cent, the owner, Pam Oldfield, wept openly when I asked how things were going. 'I put everything I had into this, and I love it, love it, the buying and the selling, it's great. But you can't just sit here and not pay your rent.' Down the valley in Hathersage, Dick Turnbull has spent 17 years building up Outside, a chain of three walkers' and climbers' shops employing 30 people. Mr Turnbull reckons he will have lost \u00a3250,000 by the end of Easter. He is a determined man, who has climbed all the great Alpine north faces in winter: unwilling to capitulate, he has put his house up as collateral for an extended loan. The Hope Valley is being ruined because every moor and footpath and almost every crag in the Peak national park is closed. At Ringinglow, overlooking Sheffield, sheep wander freely over the open moorland road. There you can legally stop, even give these beasts a sandwich. Stray on to a public footpath or a wall of heather-framed gritstone, however, and you could be fined \u00a35,000. In parts of the Scottish Highlands, meanwhile, on open land with just as many animals there is still a right to roam. Where is the logic, the scientifically based risk assessment one would assume had been done to justify these restrictions? I asked their Peak District architect, John Lomas, the national park's chief conservation officer. He admitted there was none. He had not consulted a single scientist about the real risk of walkers or climbers spreading the disease in an area where there had been no outbreaks. He knew that Maff had now issued guidance stating that paths which avoided livestock and open moors should be reopened, but he had done a risk assessment of his own, based on local knowledge and talking to his rangers. His conclusion was that it was still too risky because it was impossible to separate paths which crossed arable land from those which went near grazing, while Peak District sheep were 'unusually friendly'. Small wonder, perhaps, that the internet is humming with the protests of climbers and walkers who are beginning to think of challenging the restrictions with a mass trespass. I ran Lomas's logic past Professor Bostock. The risk of walkers spreading the disease was 'negligible,' he said. Last night I spoke to Eric Taylforth again. 'They're still saying on the news that the worst is over,' he said, and chuckled grimly. 'They should come up here. Of course, if we close, there's no one going to take our place. That's the end of this farm. Big business doesn't want to know about Herdwick hill farming.' If he and thousands of other small farmers do close, the British countryside is going to change in ways that are permanent. When one has been away for a while it's easy to forget just how beautiful Lakeland is. What makes it unique is the way its grandeur has been softened, blurred at the edges, by the interaction between nature and human beings. That is now in jeopardy: as A. Harry Griffin, the veteran Guardian country diarist wrote last week, the end of the Herdwicks will swiftly create a dystopia of broken walls, and rampant gorse, juniper and bog. The new leaves on the trees deceive us. Across most of Britain, spring has been cancelled. then and now \u00b7 Agriculture has declined from being 3 per cent of national gross domestic product in 1975 to just 1 per cent. \u00b7 Over the same period, farms and herds have got bigger in size as smallholdings have become less economically viable. Pig farmers in 1978 kept an average of 200 animals. By 1998 that figure was 500. \u00b7 Farms have also become more productive, with a smaller number of workers. In 1974 Britain produced 160 tonnes of wheat a hectare, compared with just 100 in 1974. But during the same period the rural workforce shrank from about 600,000 to 390,000. \u00b7 Government figures expect the trend to bigger farms and fewer workers will continue. By 2005, 50,000 more workers will have left farming and 25 per cent of farms will have closed or merged with their neighbours.",

      "bodyText": "Your home is cluttered, you need more rooms and extra space - the obvious conclusion is that you must move to a new house. But if you add up the cost, you may want to think again. Increasing numbers of people are choosing to extend their homes rather than move because it may cost much less. Councils across the UK recorded dramatic increases in the number of planning applications received in the year up to last September - in the North West and South West of England, rises of between 9 and 13 per cent. Most requests involved plans to extend houses by adding a conservatory or extra room, or by converting a loft. Much of the spur to extend is driven by recent changes in stamp duty, which make 'trading up' to larger houses much less attractive in some sectors of the market. People wanting to move to a larger house beyond the \u00a3250,000 or \u00a3500,000 levels could fund a substantial part of an extension if they stayed put instead and used the money they would have spent on stamp duty. Creating more space at home is now the key driver for the home improvement industry. Alliance and Leicester polled 2,500 homeowners to list their most desired home improvements - adding a conservatory was top of the wish list and a loft conversion or more general extension came in third. Creating more space is likely to add value to your house, too. Tim Hague of Alliance &amp; Leicester says: 'Not all home improvements will make you money as tastes differ greatly. Stripped floorboards may appeal to young couples but may not be so practical for a family with children. People looking to add value should create extra space - most people move because they need extra space.' At the higher end of the market there has always been a tendency to create more rooms.

      "body": "<p>What we feed our children has changed dramatically over the past few decades - indeed, it is evolving day by day. As we go to press, the word is: organic vegetables, no red meat, no peanuts - but all that will probably change by the end of the week. While parents understandably chop and change about what is or isn't good for their kids, one thing remains constant: the sort of food young children ask for at their birthday party. </p> <p>When I asked a group of children what they wanted for their birthday tea - and allowing them total adult-free abandon - they chose food virtually identical to the stuff served up at every birthday party I went to 30 years ago. It seems that no matter how much children tolerate our latest thoughts and concerns for their dietary wellbeing, what is truly embedded in their collective soul is the thought of chocolate rice-crispy cakes, jelly, ice cream and birthday cake. Of course, there are one or two things that pop up for a year or two then deflate as fast as a knifed Teletubby, but there is a constant, unshakable core which one must respect. To do anything else on this special day would be to break some unwritten rule passed down throughout history. While we can swap the phony orange colouring for freshly squeezed juice and sneak real milk chocolate into the cakes instead of chocolate-flavour covering, some things are written in stone, and we change them at our peril. </p> <p>Fair enough, I do as I am told, even by someone in short trousers. Whatever good intentions we may have for the rest of the year, I don't honestly think we should even attempt to inject our usual healthy-eating principles into these proceedings. This is a party - their party - and if they want to eat shocking-pink Barbie cake with tooth-rotting icing and six different E numbers, then we shouldn't try to talk them out of it. It is only one day a year, and it just won't be a party if we start clucking away about brown rice and organic carrots. </p> <p>One of the things I regret most about my childhood was the amount of sugar I was allowed to consume. Buckets of the stuff. I am now paying the price for years of marshmallows and fizzy pop. But as I said, it's a party, and sweet, sweet cake is always at the top of the list. A big cake, yes, but even fairy cakes, complete with camp icing and sugar flowers, are a constant, and when all is said and done, absurdly charming. Adults, no matter what they pretend, find them irresistible. It must say something that if ever I get deeply depressed, the sushi, noodles and fresh fruit juice go out the window to be replaced by a box of Mr Kipling iced fancies eaten in my dressing gown. </p> <p>The peak of any party was, and still is, reached with the blowing out of the candles. If anybody remembers to dim the lights, then so much the better. I can still feel the butterflies in my tummy as I breathed in, the humiliation of not blowing them out all at once being too much to bear. There was, I seem to remember, an adult strategically situated over my shoulder to make sure they were, by hook or by crook, extinguished in one puff. </p> <p>There is something special about having your own individual iced cake, but nothing can beat the sheer spectacle of a vast layer cake studded with candles. The best idea I have come across in this respect is Konditor &amp; Cook's (020 7407 5100) tiny iced squares - complete with icing messages or flowers - that can be handed out individually or pushed together to form one huge cake. So the kids get a fabulous, multicoloured birthday cake that can be speared with candles, and then, as if by magic, it splits into 20 tiny cakes. They can tuck in then and there or take their individual sticky square home to squash into the carpet in the back of the car. </p> <p>While there are a number of rather good books encouraging children to cook, most of those on cooking for children seem to me to be somewhat patronising and out of touch. No parent I have ever met can explain the phenomenal book sales of one particular bestselling author. According to most parents I have spoken to, there is still a huge gap in the market for a book on cooking for children. But one book that gets nearer than most, and was loved by everyone I spoke to, is Eat Up by ex-Ivy head chef Mark Hix (\u00a316.99, Fourth Estate). While the plethora of photographs of cutesy children holding free-range eggs will send even the most adoring parents reaching for the sickbag, the recipes themselves are cracking stuff. Salmon and pea casserole, Corn fritters, fishcakes with herb sauce and Crispy pig's tails put this book head and shoulders above the competition. Here at last are recipes that kids - at least the ones I know - really want to eat. And yes, there is chocolate rice-crispy birthday cake, too. As if anyone would dare.</p> <p><strong> Mark Hix's Thai summer rolls</strong></p> <p> Children often prefer raw vegetables to cooked ones. They also like messing about in the kitchen. I see every reason to mercifully exploit this. How you could approach it is by letting them wrap up their own Thai summer rolls. Follow the recipe below, but instead of wrapping the rolls yourself, give each child a piece or two of rice paper, and pile the vegetables in dishes in the middle of the table. The kids then grab whatever they want, heap it up on their rice paper, then roll it up and eat it. Huge fun. I wish my parents had thought if this instead of sandwiches made of egg and cress and white sliced. Makes 8-12. </p> <p><strong>2 spring onions, finely shredded </strong> <br><strong> 10-12 mangetouts, finely shredded </strong> <br><strong> 2 large carrots, peeled and finely shredded </strong> <br><strong> 1 chicken breast, cooked and finely shredded </strong> <br><strong> 1-2 tsp sesame oil </strong> <br><strong> 1-2 tsp soy sauce</strong> <br><strong> 1 tbsp chopped coriander </strong> <br><strong> 8-12 small rice-paper sheets (from Chinese grocers and major supermarkets) </strong> </p> <p>Mix together all the ingredients except the rice paper and season lightly with salt and pepper, if necessary. </p> <p>Take a shallow bowl large enough to hold the rice paper and half fill it with warm water. Put two or three pieces of rice paper at a time into the water to soften - this normally takes 2-3 minutes. Remove from the water and drain on kitchen paper. Put some of the chicken and vegetable mixture down the centre of each piece of paper and roll up as tightly as possible, then store, seam-side down, on a tray covered with clingfilm until required.</p> <p><strong> Mark Hix's elderflower jelly</strong></p> <p> It isn't a party without jelly. Remember not to double up on gelatine if you make more than the amount below. Makes 6 small jellies. </p> <p><strong>800ml water </strong> <br><strong> juice of 1 lemon </strong> <br><strong> 400g caster sugar </strong> <br><strong> 40g gelatine </strong> <br><strong> 100ml elderflower cordial </strong> <br><strong> 200g mixed berries (strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries) </strong></p> <p>Bring the water and lemon juice to the boil, add the sugar and stir until dissolved, then remove from the heat, Soak the gelatine leaves in cold water for a minute or so until soft. Gently squeeze out the water, add the gelatine to the sugar syrup and stir until dissolved. Add the elderflower cordial, then leave the jelly to cool but do not let it set. </p> <p>Put the berries into a 1.5 litre jelly mould or 4-6 individual moulds, then pour in the jelly. Put in the fridge for an hour or so until set.</p> <p><strong> Blueberry muffins</strong></p> <p> Blueberries are perfect for throwing into fairy cakes and muffins because most kids seem to like them and, unknown to them, they are little powerhouses of vitamins. Also, if you squash them between your thumb and finger as you add them to the cake mixture, you will find they bleed, sending beautiful purple blue ripples throughout the finished cakes. Makes 12. </p> <p><strong>250g plain flour </strong> <br><strong> 1 level tsp baking powder </strong> <br><strong> 4 tbsp caster sugar </strong> <br><strong> 1 medium egg </strong> <br><strong> grated zest of 1 small orange </strong> <br><strong> 225ml buttermilk or milk </strong> <br><strong> 50g butter, melted </strong> <br><strong> 225g blueberries </strong></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200 C/gas mark 6. Sift the flour and baking powder into a large bowl, then stir in the caster sugar and tsp of salt. </p> <p>In a separate bowl, beat the egg and add the orange zest and the buttermilk or milk. Stir in the melted butter, then pour the mixture into the flour. Stir for half a dozen strokes, then stop. The mixture will be lumpy, but this does not matter. Divide half the mixture between 12 buttered muffin tins, then drop about four blueberries into each one and cover with the remaining mixture. </p> <p>Bake the muffins the centre of the preheated oven for about 20 minutes till risen and golden. Serve warm.</p> <p>\u0095 Overleaf, Jim Ainsworth on where to find fun-filled ingredients for a children's party.</p>",

      "bodyText": "What we feed our children has changed dramatically over the past few decades - indeed, it is evolving day by day. As we go to press, the word is: organic vegetables, no red meat, no peanuts - but all that will probably change by the end of the week. While parents understandably chop and change about what is or isn't good for their kids, one thing remains constant: the sort of food young children ask for at their birthday party. When I asked a group of children what they wanted for their birthday tea - and allowing them total adult-free abandon - they chose food virtually identical to the stuff served up at every birthday party I went to 30 years ago. It seems that no matter how much children tolerate our latest thoughts and concerns for their dietary wellbeing, what is truly embedded in their collective soul is the thought of chocolate rice-crispy cakes, jelly, ice cream and birthday cake. Of course, there are one or two things that pop up for a year or two then deflate as fast as a knifed Teletubby, but there is a constant, unshakable core which one must respect. To do anything else on this special day would be to break some unwritten rule passed down throughout history. While we can swap the phony orange colouring for freshly squeezed juice and sneak real milk chocolate into the cakes instead of chocolate-flavour covering, some things are written in stone, and we change them at our peril. Fair enough, I do as I am told, even by someone in short trousers. Whatever good intentions we may have for the rest of the year, I don't honestly think we should even attempt to inject our usual healthy-eating principles into these proceedings. This is a party - their party - and if they want to eat shocking-pink Barbie cake with tooth-rotting icing and six different E numbers, then we shouldn't try to talk them out of it. It is only one day a year, and it just won't be a party if we start clucking away about brown rice and organic carrots. One of the things I regret most about my childhood was the amount of sugar I was allowed to consume. Buckets of the stuff. I am now paying the price for years of marshmallows and fizzy pop. But as I said, it's a party, and sweet, sweet cake is always at the top of the list. A big cake, yes, but even fairy cakes, complete with camp icing and sugar flowers, are a constant, and when all is said and done, absurdly charming. Adults, no matter what they pretend, find them irresistible. It must say something that if ever I get deeply depressed, the sushi, noodles and fresh fruit juice go out the window to be replaced by a box of Mr Kipling iced fancies eaten in my dressing gown. The peak of any party was, and still is, reached with the blowing out of the candles. If anybody remembers to dim the lights, then so much the better. I can still feel the butterflies in my tummy as I breathed in, the humiliation of not blowing them out all at once being too much to bear. There was, I seem to remember, an adult strategically situated over my shoulder to make sure they were, by hook or by crook, extinguished in one puff. There is something special about having your own individual iced cake, but nothing can beat the sheer spectacle of a vast layer cake studded with candles. The best idea I have come across in this respect is Konditor &amp; Cook's (020 7407 5100) tiny iced squares - complete with icing messages or flowers - that can be handed out individually or pushed together to form one huge cake. So the kids get a fabulous, multicoloured birthday cake that can be speared with candles, and then, as if by magic, it splits into 20 tiny cakes. They can tuck in then and there or take their individual sticky square home to squash into the carpet in the back of the car. While there are a number of rather good books encouraging children to cook, most of those on cooking for children seem to me to be somewhat patronising and out of touch. No parent I have ever met can explain the phenomenal book sales of one particular bestselling author. According to most parents I have spoken to, there is still a huge gap in the market for a book on cooking for children. But one book that gets nearer than most, and was loved by everyone I spoke to, is Eat Up by ex-Ivy head chef Mark Hix (\u00a316.99, Fourth Estate). While the plethora of photographs of cutesy children holding free-range eggs will send even the most adoring parents reaching for the sickbag, the recipes themselves are cracking stuff. Salmon and pea casserole, Corn fritters, fishcakes with herb sauce and Crispy pig's tails put this book head and shoulders above the competition. Here at last are recipes that kids - at least the ones I know - really want to eat. And yes, there is chocolate rice-crispy birthday cake, too. As if anyone would dare. Mark Hix's Thai summer rolls Children often prefer raw vegetables to cooked ones. They also like messing about in the kitchen. I see every reason to mercifully exploit this. How you could approach it is by letting them wrap up their own Thai summer rolls. Follow the recipe below, but instead of wrapping the rolls yourself, give each child a piece or two of rice paper, and pile the vegetables in dishes in the middle of the table. The kids then grab whatever they want, heap it up on their rice paper, then roll it up and eat it. Huge fun. I wish my parents had thought if this instead of sandwiches made of egg and cress and white sliced. Makes 8-12. 2 spring onions, finely shredded 10-12 mangetouts, finely shredded 2 large carrots, peeled and finely shredded 1 chicken breast, cooked and finely shredded 1-2 tsp sesame oil 1-2 tsp soy sauce 1 tbsp chopped coriander 8-12 small rice-paper sheets (from Chinese grocers and major supermarkets) Mix together all the ingredients except the rice paper and season lightly with salt and pepper, if necessary. Take a shallow bowl large enough to hold the rice paper and half fill it with warm water. Put two or three pieces of rice paper at a time into the water to soften - this normally takes 2-3 minutes. Remove from the water and drain on kitchen paper. Put some of the chicken and vegetable mixture down the centre of each piece of paper and roll up as tightly as possible, then store, seam-side down, on a tray covered with clingfilm until required. Mark Hix's elderflower jelly It isn't a party without jelly. Remember not to double up on gelatine if you make more than the amount below. Makes 6 small jellies. 800ml water juice of 1 lemon 400g caster sugar 40g gelatine 100ml elderflower cordial 200g mixed berries (strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries) Bring the water and lemon juice to the boil, add the sugar and stir until dissolved, then remove from the heat, Soak the gelatine leaves in cold water for a minute or so until soft. Gently squeeze out the water, add the gelatine to the sugar syrup and stir until dissolved. Add the elderflower cordial, then leave the jelly to cool but do not let it set. Put the berries into a 1.5 litre jelly mould or 4-6 individual moulds, then pour in the jelly. Put in the fridge for an hour or so until set. Blueberry muffins Blueberries are perfect for throwing into fairy cakes and muffins because most kids seem to like them and, unknown to them, they are little powerhouses of vitamins. Also, if you squash them between your thumb and finger as you add them to the cake mixture, you will find they bleed, sending beautiful purple blue ripples throughout the finished cakes. Makes 12. 250g plain flour 1 level tsp baking powder 4 tbsp caster sugar 1 medium egg grated zest of 1 small orange 225ml buttermilk or milk 50g butter, melted 225g blueberries Preheat the oven to 200 C/gas mark 6. Sift the flour and baking powder into a large bowl, then stir in the caster sugar and tsp of salt. In a separate bowl, beat the egg and add the orange zest and the buttermilk or milk. Stir in the melted butter, then pour the mixture into the flour. Stir for half a dozen strokes, then stop. The mixture will be lumpy, but this does not matter. Divide half the mixture between 12 buttered muffin tins, then drop about four blueberries into each one and cover with the remaining mixture. Bake the muffins the centre of the preheated oven for about 20 minutes till risen and golden. Serve warm. \u0095 Overleaf, Jim Ainsworth on where to find fun-filled ingredients for a children's party.",

We were joined for lunch by Jocelyn's partner, Judy, which gave us the opportunity to try most of the starters and main courses. The menu, like the dining room and staff, is classically French: words and phrases like 'gratin\u00e9es' and '\u00e0 la proven\u00e7al' are scattered hither and yon. Somehow it makes it all read rather heavily, as though the dishes have been dragged from the dusty pages of Larousse and shocked into life with a defibrillator. </p> <p>Certainly, where the starters are concerned, they taste and look far better than they read. Jocelyn's starter - 'your Spanish asparagus, monsieur' as he was told, with careful emphasis - was listed as coming with smoked salmon and a hollandaise sauce, beneath a 'pastry cage'. It was a clever piece of work, the warmth of the asparagus and the cool chill of the smoked salmon giving a lovely contrast. The pastry cage was more of a bonnet, and the better for it, being light and crisp. Judy's ravioli stuffed with soft, herbed cheese was made with a fine pasta and came with a cracking sorrel sauce. I ordered moules gratin\u00e9es \u00e0 la proven\u00e7al - mussels in the shell with garlic and parsley butter - one of those dishes which it is easy to ruin: too much garlic and it becomes astringent, too long under the grill and the molluscs shrivel up. These got it right on all counts. As Jocelyn pointed out we had used up two baskets of bread to mop up our various sauces, which had to be a good sign. </p> <p>The main courses were less spectacular, but still accomplished enough, though Jocelyn and I disagreed over his choice, tuna en daube \u00e0 la proven\u00e7al. It's a classic dish which really is in Larousse : tuna, stewed with tomatoes, onions and anchovies. I don't think fresh tuna stands up well in a stew and nothing about this particular version convinced me otherwise. The flavour is too subtle to hold its own. This, though, is personal taste. Jocelyn was happy. Judy's chicken breast with tarragon came crisp skinned and the fresh herbs gave what is usually a bland piece of the bird a solid lift.

Jocelyn chose the French bread-and-butter pudding with apple and a butterscotch sauce. It was, he said, not exactly what he was expecting. There was something rather neat and tidy about what is usually a chuck-it-all-together sort of pudding, but somehow he found the will to clean the plate.

      "body": "<p>Easter arrives in the garden like a combination of a spring tide and a five-year-old's Christmas. It is the tangible measure of the season, regardless of date, weather or winter's legacy. Easter lets the garden know that spring is here, in your back yard, and we have the longest officially sanctioned break of the year to do something about it. </p> <p>I try to take Easter as a gardening holiday. This is more than just an extended weekend at home. I book it in, accept no daylight invitations, and plan four days of work. This usually means either one big job or, more often - as will be the case this year - a systematic reclamation of the garden after winter. </p> <p>Some of this depends when Easter falls. Looking back through my garden diaries of the past few years, Easter weather has varied enormously. Sometimes it is back-blisteringly hot, but the global-warmed trend does seem to be towards wet springs. In 1998, Easter was a few days earlier than this year, and the vegetables were deep under flood water. For Good Friday, 10 April, I wrote: 'Worst floods in Midlands in recorded time. The Arrow (the river just 100 yards from our back door) burst banks, killing man.' Then, the next day: 'Icy north wind all day, some snow, practically coldest day of winter.' In 1999, Easter was a week earlier still, and there was a respite in that it was merely muggy and mild. We put up the fruit-cage, sowed squashes and pumpkins, and all the plum and damson blossom were in full bloom. There is not a sign of it today, exactly two years later. Then last year, Easter was a week later than this year, and it was wet and flooded. 'Heard on the radio that it's already wettest April on record. Water in veg garden. No flushing loo, bath, washing up, etc. Afternoon sunny. Thousands of flies on box and - oddly - foxgloves. Tulips fab. Mowed all grass save where under water.' </p> <p>Whatever the weather, Easter is a time to get to grips with the garden. For garden centres it is the peak of their selling year, and everyone is inclined to get outside and do something, whether it's wet or not. The truth is that there is invariably more to do at this time of year than can possibly be achieved during the break. This can lead to the state of affairs that I often get into when I have been away a lot, where you rush outside, full of good intentions, but are overwhelmed by the enormity of horticultural neglect in the full glare of the April sunshine. The result is inconsequential pottering and an exhaustion incommensurate with the dribble of energy expended. This is why I have outlined the following plan of Easter attack, where there are four different projects for the four days of the holiday. Experienced gardeners will be too busy outside to be reading this, so no apologies for covering the basics. </p> <p> <strong> Gone to seed </strong> </p> <p> <strong>1 </strong> Seed and potting compost. This is not the same as garden compost - although, as we shall see, there is a potential overlap. Compost for sale in garden centres tends to be labelled as potting compost or general-purpose compost. Neither is the best thing for seeds sown in containers. You can buy seed compost, which is normally John Innes No 1. This not a brand but a formula. I personally do not use it, as I find it a bit plasticy. </p> <p>Most multipurpose composts use peat as the main component. This works well and is cheap but is brutally destructive to the wetlands from where it is extracted. There is no justification in ruining a balanced natural environment that has taken thousands of years to evolve just for the sake of cheap compost. So do not buy anything that has peat in it. </p> <p>There are now a number of commercial alternatives based on crushed bark, coir, commercially made compost and even, from Thames water, recycled waste. You can also easily make your own from topsoil, garden compost and sharp sand, all dried and sieved. A coir-based compost or finely crushed bark is likely to be most successful. The secret is not to use it neat. Seeds need very little nourishment to grow successfully, but they do need good drainage and an easy passage for the new roots to grow into, so mix it up 50:50 in a bucket with sharp sand (not builders' sand), perlite or vermiculite. Sharp sand is cheapest. </p> <p><strong> 2</strong> Even if you do not have a greenhouse (and you should - they add a dimension to any garden, however small), grow seeds on a windowsill or a table by a window or in a sunny porch. Avoid south-facing windows, otherwise the seeds will be scorched. West is best. A warm room is important, but if there is a radiator below the seeds, turn it down to a very gentle background heat. If the new seedlings have long stems and lean towards the window, that is a sure sign that they are starved of light. Light levels drop astonishingly quickly as you get further away from the window, so keep them near the glass. </p> <p><strong> 3</strong> Seeds germinate best in a gently warm, moist atmosphere. The moisture bit can be tricky to get right. On the whole, it is better to keep them too dry rather than too wet, but just right is best. Too much wet drowns them and the seedlings can easily 'dampen-off' - which means that they get a fungal disease and die. Too little water and they starve, droop and often never fully recover. A good tip is to soak the container in a few inches of water before you sow, so the roots go into gentle damp soil. Water the container lightly after sowing. If you have heat underneath them, you must watch that they are not drying out at the roots while remaining wet at the surface. Use your eye to judge how healthy they look. </p> <p><strong> 4</strong> What do you sow in? To start with, the soil outside is surprisingly good. Make a seedbed by clearing a square yard or two of good soil in a sunny, sheltered spot. Work it so that the soil is completely malleable ('a fine tilth'). On my soil, this means adding plenty of sharp sand. You will not need any extra goodness, although leaf mould or very well-rotted compost will help the soil structure. Make very short drills in the soil and sow seeds directly into them. These can be much closer together than seeds sown where they are to mature - just a few inches apart. If you have a cloche, so much the better. When the seeds have developed into healthy seedlings, you will carefully dig them up (with a lump of soil around the roots of each plant) and transplant them to their final site. The advantages of this system are that the growing plants develop in the soil in which they are to grow, and this helps transplantation enormously. They are also much hardier than plants grown indoors. </p> <p>If you grow seeds indoors - as I do with nearly all mine - then consider sowing in pots rather than seed trays. The roots will be bigger and they are easier to handle and prick out (the moving of seedlings to a bigger container as soon as they are big enough to handle). The sooner that seedlings are pricked out, the better and quicker they grow on. </p> <p><strong> 5</strong> Label everything. I have a rule that every container and row is labelled with the name of the plant, the variety and date sown. This is tedious but essential. The biggest mistake is to label just one pot in a batch because it is certain that pots - and therefore varieties - that look identical at seedling stage will be mixed up. I use cheap white labels and a graphite pencil. </p> <p><strong> Border patrol</strong> </p> <p><strong> 1</strong> If we get a warm spell - have faith, we will - herbaceous plants start to grow inches every day at this time of year. All the energy of the roots is put into creating new top growth, whereas later in the summer they will mainly service and supply it. Thus it is an excellent time to move them around. You can judge from the new growth the extent of the area that they will cover, and the trauma of being dug up and handled will quickly be forgotten in the warm soil. </p> <p>The easiest way to create a new herbaceous plant from an existing one is to simply chop a piece off with a spade. If the plant is relatively small, this will mean cutting it into two while it is in the soil and digging up one of the halves. If it is larger, dig up the whole thing, place it on the surface of the soil and cut pieces either in segments like a cake or as if you were cutting down a circle to make a square. The important point is to leave behind the core or centre and use the outside for the new plant. Throw away (on the compost heap) the remaining core, as all the vigour and flowering energy will be on the outside. Water the new pieces in well, and they will grow as though nothing had happened. </p> <p><strong> 2</strong> It is really important to stake all herbaceous plants before they need it. The new growth is soft and sappy and prone to being battered by wind and rain, let alone falling all over the place under their top-heavy weight. Traditionally, pea-sticks or brushwood were used, and they are still the best - they can be manipulated to support most shapes and sizes of plant and blend in well, unlike canes and string, which look a bit stark until the plants grow over them. We use thick homemade wire supports, rather like flat-topped croquet hoops, pushed into the ground. They work well, are stronger than wood, last forever and are cheap and easy to make. But whatever you use, do it well before it is remotely necessary to the plant - otherwise it will be too late. </p> <p> <strong> 3</strong> Mulching. Once the borders get into their stride, it is difficult to weed without damaging seedlings and young annuals you have planted. Now is the time to weed through and then mulch every piece of bare soil. In a border, this wants to be well-rotted organic material, both for nutritional and aesthetic reasons, although for weed-suppression, anything, from newspaper to black polythene, would do the trick. We use only well-rotted mushroom compost or spent cocoa shells on our borders. The latter we buy in sacks and the former in as large a quantity as we can get delivered, as it is the perfect soil-improver for our heavy, slightly acid soil. Cocoa shells are very light, easy to handle, fill the garden with the aroma of chocolate for weeks, and lighten the soil very effectively. They work in an unusual way. You put them on dry, pouring them round the plants. Then it rains and they form a slimy skin which, when dry, turns into a crust. This seals moisture in and stops weeds growing through. If it is reasonably dry, it also deters slugs, although if it is warm and wet it encourages them, so only use it in early spring. Mushroom compost has to be shovelled on but has the great advantage over garden compost or cattle manure of being sterile. You bring no weeds in with it. Put any mulch on at least 2in thick. Better to do half the garden properly than all of it too thinly. </p> <p><strong> 4</strong> Weeds. If you have a perennial weed growing through the middle of a herbaceous plant - couch grass is growing through one big clump of my daylilies ( Hemerocallis ) - there is only one course of action. Be completely ruthless. Dig up the entire clump and wash the roots thoroughly under a tap or strong hose until every scrap of weed root has been washed off. I would then pot it up for a month to make sure that no weed is left in before replanting it. Hand-weed the area around the affected plant with obsessive care. </p> <p><strong> 5</strong> If you are starting a new border based on herbaceous perennials (does anyone have a truly herbaceous border nowadays?), it will repay you fivefold to prepare the site properly. Such fast growers are voracious feeders, and the better and richer your soil is, the better the display. Note that I say 'soil'. I do not suggest that you feed your plants unless they are sickly. This only leads to unnaturally lush growth that is prone to attack by pests and disease. Always feed the soil, not the plant. Having said that, dig the site over thoroughly, taking out every hint of perennial weed. Add plenty of organic compost or manure. Make the border bigger than you think you need or want - it is astonishing how quickly the space gets filled after the first year. Resist the temptation to whizz out, buy some plants and stick them in half-prepared ground. Any time spent on preparation is never wasted. </p> <p><strong> Where the grass is greener</strong> </p> <p> It is that lawn time of year again. We all know that lawns are a luxury and look awful for most of the year. We all know that paved areas are much better for sitting, walking, pushing wheelbarrows and just about any other garden activity. But nevertheless, we all want a lawn. So here is a five-step plan to making the perfect patch of grass. </p> <p><strong> 1</strong> Prepare the ground well. Actually this ought to be steps 1, 2 and 3 because a lawn is only as good as the soil beneath the green stuff. If you already have a horribly scruffy area of grass and want it better, or if you are moving to a virgin site, the same applies. Dig over the whole area, removing all perennial weeds, then fork or rotovate it. If it is heavy clay, add lots of sharp sand and rotovate this in. What is lots? You cannot add too much. If your soil is light, add some organic compost and mix it in to give it some beef. Rake it reasonably level and ideally leave it for a few weeks. </p> <p><strong> 2</strong> The reason you leave it is to let the annual weeds grow. Hoe them off and rake the site again, this time trying hard to get it as smooth and level as possible. Then, when it is all but perfect, trample all over it, using your heels in a waddle. This will compact the ground to find out any dips and hollows that would appear anyway sooner or later. Rake it again. </p> <p><strong> 3</strong> Seed. If you are not in a hurry, it is undoubtedly the best option. It is easy and cheap and allows you to be specific about the type of grass you want. Choose a seed mix that suits your usage. Ryegrass brings toughness, bents and fescues a finer finish. The average family lawn is a mixture of about 60 per cent ryegrass, with bents and fescues making up the rest. Spread the seed by hand evenly. Sow it first walking in one direction and then again walking at 90 , resisting the temptation to sow it too thickly. Think of each seed as a plant that will grow strongly without much competition. Rake it over twice, reversing the order of the 90 variation. Net it or put black cotton across it to stop birds - and worse - cats. Water thoroughly. Easy peasy. </p> <p><strong> 4</strong> Turf has the great advantage of looking good from day one, but this is almost the only advantage over seed. It is essential to prepare the ground for turf in exactly the same way as for seed. Make sure that the turf is delivered either the night before laying or early on the same day, because it is important to get it spread out as soon as possible. You will need some boards (scaffolding planks are ideal) to kneel and walk on. Start at one end and lay the turfs in courses like a horizontal brick wall. Butt the edges up really tightly and keep any shorter lengths in the middle of a course, not at the edge. Move the planks over the laid turf as you progress, never stepping directly on to them once they are down. The weight of the boards also acts as a leveller. When you have finished, fence it off from children and animals and give it a really good soak. Never let the turf dry out for at least a fortnight. This is vital. If you see any of the turfs curling up at the edges, soak them immediately and go on soaking them until they are saturated. </p> <p><strong> 5</strong> Newly laid turf or grass seed should be allowed to grow longer than a conventional lawn in its first year. The length of a football pitch is more appropriate, giving the roots a chance to be fed and establish. Mow it lightly after about a month. For the rest of the summer, cut it no more than once a week, collecting up the cuttings each time. Do not expect your perfect lawn until a year after it is made. </p> <p><strong> Paving the way</strong> </p> <p> One of the first things I try to do around Easter is to have a meal outside and to eat and drink outside as much as possible thereafter. But to enjoy this properly, it is essential to have a place that is dedicated to this. </p> <p> <strong> 1</strong> Choose your site. Make it big enough. Even if you live alone, ideally you want to be able to fit a table, four chairs and - vitally - lots of pots. The first thing to think about is when you'll use it. If having breakfast outside is important to you, then the site must get morning sun, which comes in low from the east. If you are likely to use it at lunchtime, then it must have shade, because even in this country, lunchtime sun can be uncomfortably hot. If you are to use it mainly for sipping your gin and tonic after work, then it must have a clear line of sunshine to the west. </p> <p> <strong> 2</strong> Choose your materials. No one can decide the aesthetics of this but you - but here are some practical considerations. York stone adds instant weathered substance, which is what we Brits tend to like. But it is expensive, heavy and can be hard to get a good supply. Brick can be patterned in lots of ways and is easy to handle and readily available. But it is not cheap, and old bricks crumble in frost and can be very slippery. Artificial paving slabs look best when overtly modern, are cheap, easy to lay and very durable. Concrete is not to be sniffed at and can be a very good cheap surface, especially if brushed over or polished, depending on the desired effect. Whatever you choose, avoid a rough, bumpy surface. Chairs and tables want to sit level. </p> <p> <strong> 3</strong> Dig the site out and use pegs to establish a level, leaving enough room for plenty of hardcore. Bind this with sand using the pegtops for your level. Always lay stones, pavings and bricks directly on to sand without any cement. Assuming that it is a rectangular shape - and there is no reason why it should be - start at one corner and work across establishing a course, adding and subtracting sand as necessary. It is essential that each item, be it a small brick paver or a huge stone slab, is absolutely level with itself and its neighbours before you lay another. Let 1mm discrepancy get established and it will be a foot-tripping 10mm by the end of the row. Because I do not use cement, I do not build in a fall as the water drains between the materials. If you want a non-draining surface, then you must create a gentle fall away from any building. </p> <p><strong> 4</strong> When it is finished (and if you have odd bits to fill, remember that a table is likely to cover some sins in the middle and pots can deal with the corners), brush over the joins with more sand. You can add some potting compost to the mix if you want plants to grow in the cracks, although weeds will inevitably join them, too. Water this sand in or leave it for a week and then go over it again after it has been washed in. That's it. </p> <p><strong> 5</strong> Pots. Lots and lots of pots. Patios and terraces are the best place for growing scented plants in pots. I suggest herbs, especially Mediterranean ones such as rosemary, thyme, lavender, artemisia and sage (which can all be given the really sharp drainage they need), scented-leafed geraniums and pelargoniums, bay, sweet peas, lilies, tobacco plants - use pots to create a sweetly scented and beautiful background to your al fresco life. And finally, you will want some shelter from the sun and perhaps, just perhaps, from the rain. </p> <p>Happy Easter.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Easter arrives in the garden like a combination of a spring tide and a five-year-old's Christmas. It is the tangible measure of the season, regardless of date, weather or winter's legacy. Easter lets the garden know that spring is here, in your back yard, and we have the longest officially sanctioned break of the year to do something about it. I try to take Easter as a gardening holiday. This is more than just an extended weekend at home. I book it in, accept no daylight invitations, and plan four days of work. This usually means either one big job or, more often - as will be the case this year - a systematic reclamation of the garden after winter. Some of this depends when Easter falls. Looking back through my garden diaries of the past few years, Easter weather has varied enormously. Sometimes it is back-blisteringly hot, but the global-warmed trend does seem to be towards wet springs. In 1998, Easter was a few days earlier than this year, and the vegetables were deep under flood water. For Good Friday, 10 April, I wrote: 'Worst floods in Midlands in recorded time. The Arrow (the river just 100 yards from our back door) burst banks, killing man.' Then, the next day: 'Icy north wind all day, some snow, practically coldest day of winter.' In 1999, Easter was a week earlier still, and there was a respite in that it was merely muggy and mild. We put up the fruit-cage, sowed squashes and pumpkins, and all the plum and damson blossom were in full bloom. There is not a sign of it today, exactly two years later. Then last year, Easter was a week later than this year, and it was wet and flooded. 'Heard on the radio that it's already wettest April on record. Water in veg garden. No flushing loo, bath, washing up, etc. Afternoon sunny. Thousands of flies on box and - oddly - foxgloves. Tulips fab. Mowed all grass save where under water.' Whatever the weather, Easter is a time to get to grips with the garden. For garden centres it is the peak of their selling year, and everyone is inclined to get outside and do something, whether it's wet or not. The truth is that there is invariably more to do at this time of year than can possibly be achieved during the break. This can lead to the state of affairs that I often get into when I have been away a lot, where you rush outside, full of good intentions, but are overwhelmed by the enormity of horticultural neglect in the full glare of the April sunshine. The result is inconsequential pottering and an exhaustion incommensurate with the dribble of energy expended. This is why I have outlined the following plan of Easter attack, where there are four different projects for the four days of the holiday. Experienced gardeners will be too busy outside to be reading this, so no apologies for covering the basics. Gone to seed 1 Seed and potting compost. This is not the same as garden compost - although, as we shall see, there is a potential overlap. Compost for sale in garden centres tends to be labelled as potting compost or general-purpose compost. Neither is the best thing for seeds sown in containers. You can buy seed compost, which is normally John Innes No 1. This not a brand but a formula. I personally do not use it, as I find it a bit plasticy. Most multipurpose composts use peat as the main component. This works well and is cheap but is brutally destructive to the wetlands from where it is extracted. There is no justification in ruining a balanced natural environment that has taken thousands of years to evolve just for the sake of cheap compost. So do not buy anything that has peat in it. There are now a number of commercial alternatives based on crushed bark, coir, commercially made compost and even, from Thames water, recycled waste. You can also easily make your own from topsoil, garden compost and sharp sand, all dried and sieved. A coir-based compost or finely crushed bark is likely to be most successful. The secret is not to use it neat. Seeds need very little nourishment to grow successfully, but they do need good drainage and an easy passage for the new roots to grow into, so mix it up 50:50 in a bucket with sharp sand (not builders' sand), perlite or vermiculite. Sharp sand is cheapest. 2 Even if you do not have a greenhouse (and you should - they add a dimension to any garden, however small), grow seeds on a windowsill or a table by a window or in a sunny porch. Avoid south-facing windows, otherwise the seeds will be scorched. West is best. A warm room is important, but if there is a radiator below the seeds, turn it down to a very gentle background heat. If the new seedlings have long stems and lean towards the window, that is a sure sign that they are starved of light. Light levels drop astonishingly quickly as you get further away from the window, so keep them near the glass. 3 Seeds germinate best in a gently warm, moist atmosphere. The moisture bit can be tricky to get right. On the whole, it is better to keep them too dry rather than too wet, but just right is best. Too much wet drowns them and the seedlings can easily 'dampen-off' - which means that they get a fungal disease and die. Too little water and they starve, droop and often never fully recover. A good tip is to soak the container in a few inches of water before you sow, so the roots go into gentle damp soil. Water the container lightly after sowing. If you have heat underneath them, you must watch that they are not drying out at the roots while remaining wet at the surface. Use your eye to judge how healthy they look. 4 What do you sow in? To start with, the soil outside is surprisingly good. Make a seedbed by clearing a square yard or two of good soil in a sunny, sheltered spot. Work it so that the soil is completely malleable ('a fine tilth'). On my soil, this means adding plenty of sharp sand. You will not need any extra goodness, although leaf mould or very well-rotted compost will help the soil structure. Make very short drills in the soil and sow seeds directly into them. These can be much closer together than seeds sown where they are to mature - just a few inches apart. If you have a cloche, so much the better. When the seeds have developed into healthy seedlings, you will carefully dig them up (with a lump of soil around the roots of each plant) and transplant them to their final site. The advantages of this system are that the growing plants develop in the soil in which they are to grow, and this helps transplantation enormously. They are also much hardier than plants grown indoors. If you grow seeds indoors - as I do with nearly all mine - then consider sowing in pots rather than seed trays. The roots will be bigger and they are easier to handle and prick out (the moving of seedlings to a bigger container as soon as they are big enough to handle). The sooner that seedlings are pricked out, the better and quicker they grow on. 5 Label everything. I have a rule that every container and row is labelled with the name of the plant, the variety and date sown. This is tedious but essential. The biggest mistake is to label just one pot in a batch because it is certain that pots - and therefore varieties - that look identical at seedling stage will be mixed up. I use cheap white labels and a graphite pencil. Border patrol 1 If we get a warm spell - have faith, we will - herbaceous plants start to grow inches every day at this time of year. All the energy of the roots is put into creating new top growth, whereas later in the summer they will mainly service and supply it. Thus it is an excellent time to move them around. You can judge from the new growth the extent of the area that they will cover, and the trauma of being dug up and handled will quickly be forgotten in the warm soil. The easiest way to create a new herbaceous plant from an existing one is to simply chop a piece off with a spade. If the plant is relatively small, this will mean cutting it into two while it is in the soil and digging up one of the halves. If it is larger, dig up the whole thing, place it on the surface of the soil and cut pieces either in segments like a cake or as if you were cutting down a circle to make a square. The important point is to leave behind the core or centre and use the outside for the new plant. Throw away (on the compost heap) the remaining core, as all the vigour and flowering energy will be on the outside. Water the new pieces in well, and they will grow as though nothing had happened. 2 It is really important to stake all herbaceous plants before they need it. The new growth is soft and sappy and prone to being battered by wind and rain, let alone falling all over the place under their top-heavy weight. Traditionally, pea-sticks or brushwood were used, and they are still the best - they can be manipulated to support most shapes and sizes of plant and blend in well, unlike canes and string, which look a bit stark until the plants grow over them.

We all know that paved areas are much better for sitting, walking, pushing wheelbarrows and just about any other garden activity. But nevertheless, we all want a lawn.

Actually this ought to be steps 1, 2 and 3 because a lawn is only as good as the soil beneath the green stuff.

      "body": "<p>The exploitation of genetic testing by insurers is set to be outlawed by the government amid fears of creating an uninsurable 'genetic underclass'. </p> <p>Health Secretary Alan Milburn will signal this week that the use of so-called genetic profiling tests, which could predict who will die prematurely or suffer chronic disease, to deny people essentials such as mortgage cover should be banned. He is still awaiting final recommendations from the ethical watchdog, the Human Genetics Commission, next month before taking a final decision, but is known to favour at least a partial moratorium. One option considered by the commission is to regulate against 'genetic discrimination' by insurers in the same way as racial prejudice. </p> <p>Milburn will also pledge legislation to ban human reproductive cloning - likely to be highlighted in Labour's manifesto - to allay public fears about scientists playing God. The practice is already outlawed by watchdog, the Human Fertility and Embryology Authority, but he wants to ensure that this ban could not be reversed in future. </p> <p>Milburn will use a speech on Thursday to highlight potential benefits of genetic testing, such as new screening programmes for those found to have inherited a risk of serious treatable disease, and promise NHS funding for developing accurate tests.

      "bodyText": "The exploitation of genetic testing by insurers is set to be outlawed by the government amid fears of creating an uninsurable 'genetic underclass'. Health Secretary Alan Milburn will signal this week that the use of so-called genetic profiling tests, which could predict who will die prematurely or suffer chronic disease, to deny people essentials such as mortgage cover should be banned. He is still awaiting final recommendations from the ethical watchdog, the Human Genetics Commission, next month before taking a final decision, but is known to favour at least a partial moratorium. One option considered by the commission is to regulate against 'genetic discrimination' by insurers in the same way as racial prejudice. Milburn will also pledge legislation to ban human reproductive cloning - likely to be highlighted in Labour's manifesto - to allay public fears about scientists playing God. The practice is already outlawed by watchdog, the Human Fertility and Embryology Authority, but he wants to ensure that this ban could not be reversed in future. Milburn will use a speech on Thursday to highlight potential benefits of genetic testing, such as new screening programmes for those found to have inherited a risk of serious treatable disease, and promise NHS funding for developing accurate tests. But he will warn discoveries must not be used to divide patients into a 'genetic underclass' likely to become ill and a healthy 'genetic superclass'. 'The NHS over the next decade and beyond can put Britain at the leading edge of this new frontier, not just in advances on genetic testing but to develop for Britain modern genetic health services unrivalled anywhere in the world,' he will tell his audience at the International Centre for Life in Newcastle. Milburn will stop short of announcing an outright ban on insurers using any genetic test results, pending commission reports.

For all the backbiting it hasn't worked out too badly. </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> Huh. When are you planning to hand over? </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> Waitress, could I just have a little extra parmesan on my sun-dried tomatoes? Come on Gordon, let's relax like the old days. What are you reading over Easter? </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> The Road to Victory </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> Is it about me? I'm reading Tony Blair, Prime Minister by John Rentoul. </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> The Road to Victory is not about you Tony. It's Martin Gilbert on Churchill, 1941 to 1945. </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> Interesting? </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> The only thing that would interest you is that there is a famous postponement. </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> What famous postponement? The second world war didn't come up in my Law Studies. </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> Operation Overlord, or D-Day to you. It was postponed from the beginning of May to the beginning of June - like something else I could mention. </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> Go on Gordon, tell me more. This sounds like a good omen. What were the dates? </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> It was postponed from 1 May to 6 June 1944. </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> Why, that's amazing, Gordon. So close to postponing the election from 3 May to 7 June. D-Day, Britain's finest hour! </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> Somehow, I don't see 7 June 2001 as B-Day, Blair's finest hour. Frankly we've been bloody lucky. </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> Not just lucky, Gordon. Why, our economic policies have been wonderful. </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> And we've stolen the Opposition's clothes. And Ken Clarke isn't even on the opposition front bench. Frankly it's been painfully easy. </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> Oh, by the way. That reminds me. I've heard a rumour that after my - I mean our - landslide victory, Portillo's going to take over with K. Clarke as his deputy. </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> Stranger things have happened. Clarke teamed up with Redwood last time. But, come on Tony, what about all these rumours that you want to step down and earn some money? </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> I say, waitress, can we have another bottle of mineral water please? </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> You can't keep me waiting forever, Tony. </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> Well, Gordon, if I may say so, it takes two to play that game. </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> What do you mean? </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> How long are you going to keep me waiting? </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> I don't know what you are talking about. </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> Oh yes you do. Europe. You stole control of our European policy from me and, frankly, I'm in your hands. </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> You mean the famous five tests and all that? </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> I certainly do. When can you deliver me a favourable verdict? </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> Well, Mervyn King of the Bank said it would take 200 years to be really sure. </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> I'm not hanging around that long. Waitress, I think we need another bottle of New World chardonnay. </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> Oh Lord, anything but chardonnay. </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> Seriously though. What's our policy? </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> We'll make the assessment in two years. It will be rigorous and fair. </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> Oh dear. Does that mean... </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> It means it will be on the one hand and on the other hand. How can it possibly be conclusive? </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> Couldn't we announce the day after the election that we are in favour of joining the euro in principle? </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> We've already done that. We're always doing that. But at the moment we are doing a lot better than our continental neighbours, and that European Cental Bank of theirs is crazy. </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> Things may change. </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> Speaking purely from the economic side, I don't see the hurry. If we carry on doing well, and the investment keeps coming in... </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> But how long will that go on? And isn't it stopping already? Why, the other day I felt just like an Old Labour Harold Wilson, telephoning the American headquarters of Motorola and pleading with them not to cut back in Scotland. </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> Don't worry, Tony. Thanks to my - our - policies, we're well placed to ride the cycle. </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> I thought we said we'd abolished the economic cycle? </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> No, Tony, recent events have forced us to redefine that boast. We're well placed to ride the cycle. We're well placed to ride the cycle. Got it? </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> OK, OK. </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> So do you want to do a deal? </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> What sort of deal? </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> I make sure that, although the five tests are stringent, fair, objective, on the one hand and on the other, nevertheless the Treasury comes down in favour, and I fight to the hilt for you during the referendum campaign. </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> This is wonderful, Gordon. Fancy a euro-friendly Calvados? </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> No, I'll have a John Smith's Glenlivet if you don't mind. </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> And I'm the British Prime Minister who goes down in history as taking us into Europe. </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> No, Tony, Ted Heath's already done that. You go down as keeping us in Europe. </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> And you, Gordon? What can I do for you in return? </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> Step down in my favour immediately after the referendum. </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> Er, hang on: surely you can allow me a year or so to savour the delights? </p> <p> <strong> Brown: </strong> Well, maybe a week or so. </p> <p> <strong> Blair: </strong> A week or so?

Brown: And we've stolen the Opposition's clothes. And Ken Clarke isn't even on the opposition front bench. Frankly it's been painfully easy. Blair: Oh, by the way. That reminds me. I've heard a rumour that after my - I mean our - landslide victory, Portillo's going to take over with K. Clarke as his deputy. Brown: Stranger things have happened. Clarke teamed up with Redwood last time. But, come on Tony, what about all these rumours that you want to step down and earn some money? Blair: I say, waitress, can we have another bottle of mineral water please? Brown: You can't keep me waiting forever, Tony. Blair: Well, Gordon, if I may say so, it takes two to play that game. Brown: What do you mean? Blair: How long are you going to keep me waiting? Brown: I don't know what you are talking about. Blair: Oh yes you do. Europe. You stole control of our European policy from me and, frankly, I'm in your hands. Brown: You mean the famous five tests and all that? Blair: I certainly do. When can you deliver me a favourable verdict? Brown: Well, Mervyn King of the Bank said it would take 200 years to be really sure. Blair: I'm not hanging around that long. Waitress, I think we need another bottle of New World chardonnay. Brown: Oh Lord, anything but chardonnay. Blair: Seriously though. What's our policy? Brown: We'll make the assessment in two years. It will be rigorous and fair. Blair: Oh dear. Does that mean... Brown: It means it will be on the one hand and on the other hand. How can it possibly be conclusive? Blair: Couldn't we announce the day after the election that we are in favour of joining the euro in principle? Brown: We've already done that. We're always doing that. But at the moment we are doing a lot better than our continental neighbours, and that European Cental Bank of theirs is crazy. Blair: Things may change. Brown: Speaking purely from the economic side, I don't see the hurry. If we carry on doing well, and the investment keeps coming in... Blair: But how long will that go on? And isn't it stopping already? Why, the other day I felt just like an Old Labour Harold Wilson, telephoning the American headquarters of Motorola and pleading with them not to cut back in Scotland. Brown: Don't worry, Tony. Thanks to my - our - policies, we're well placed to ride the cycle. Blair: I thought we said we'd abolished the economic cycle? Brown: No, Tony, recent events have forced us to redefine that boast. We're well placed to ride the cycle. We're well placed to ride the cycle. Got it? Blair: OK, OK. Brown: So do you want to do a deal? Blair: What sort of deal? Brown: I make sure that, although the five tests are stringent, fair, objective, on the one hand and on the other, nevertheless the Treasury comes down in favour, and I fight to the hilt for you during the referendum campaign. Blair: This is wonderful, Gordon. Fancy a euro-friendly Calvados? Brown: No, I'll have a John Smith's Glenlivet if you don't mind. Blair: And I'm the British Prime Minister who goes down in history as taking us into Europe. Brown: No, Tony, Ted Heath's already done that. You go down as keeping us in Europe. Blair: And you, Gordon? What can I do for you in return? Brown: Step down in my favour immediately after the referendum. Blair: Er, hang on: surely you can allow me a year or so to savour the delights? Brown: Well, maybe a week or so. Blair: A week or so? Could be a long time in politics, Gordon.",

Should the device fail to go off, the chances are Sky's competitors will end up on the casualty list instead. </p> <p>The bomb in question is an Office of Fair Trading inquiry so far four months in the making. The OFT launched the investigation just before Christmas, predicting that it would emerge in around six months' time. But none of the OFT's mandarins banked on how contaminated pigswill would end up impacting on the world of media regulation. </p> <p>Now that the election has been postponed because of the foot and mouth crisis, OFT sources suggest that the potentially incendiary report won't be published until the end of June at the earliest. </p> <p>It is clearly received wisdom in the corridors of Fleetbank House that it's not a good idea to annoy Rupert Murdoch - whose News International effectively controls Sky through its 37.5 per cent stake - the month before an election. Especially given that Sky could end up facing a \u00a3100 million fine (10 per cent of its earnings) as a result of the investigation. </p> <p>At the heart of the inquiry lies the question of whether Sky has abused a dominant market position in broadcasting. Rivals, chiefly ONdigital, the terrestrial digital television service jointly owned by Carlton and Granada, say the wholesale price it pays to carry Sky's premium channels (sports and films), is almost as high as that it charges its own subscribers. </p> <p>As such ONdigital faces an unpleasant choice: either it raises the prices it charges for the channels, or it takes a hit and subsidises the service. The former is practically a no brainer - consumers will simply opt to take Sky. And the latter is now unthinkable, given that ONdigital is predicted to shell out \u00a31.2 billion by 2003 in a desperate bid to subsidise the cost of its set-top boxes - four times what it had originally predicted. </p> <p>A clearly frustrated Stuart Prebble, chief executive of ONdigital, summed up his company's position: 'It seems there are only two possible relationships with Sky: one is hostile; the other is servile.' </p> <p>For ONdigital - Sky's biggest customer, with a million subscribers - such a pricing policy means it loses money if subscribers take just one or two channels. It breaks even if they take three, moves to profit if they take four. </p> <p>When it launched, ONdigital had no idea that Sky would be so hard-nosed. 'They just didn't envisage that Sky would be so aggressive,' one industry source said. 'Sky ate them alive.' </p> <p>ONdigital also cries foul over the way Sky cross-promotes its channels. Viewers watching Sky Sports are regularly reminded they can check out the Player Cam on Sky Sports Extra - a service not available on ONdigital. And, while Sky Premier might show the latest movies for satellite viewers, it doesn't always offer the same service for terrestrial viewers. Sky's subscribers saw the blockbuster Men In Black two years before their ONdigital counterparts, for example. </p> <p>Then there are the exclusion clauses Sky has signed with a number of channels, blocking their availability to other broadcasters. Taking 50 per cent stakes in the likes of the History Channel, Nickelodeon and National Geographic, not to mention owning Fox Kids outright, has helped it clinch such deals. </p> <p>Now Adam Singer, chief executive of cable firm Telewest, has predicted that ONdigital will have to either fold or merge with another media company if it is to survive. But help can be found in strange quarters. </p> <p>The big pub chains are none too happy with Sky's pricing policy, either. Only a few months ago the biggest bars were paying \u00a3380 a month for their Sky fix. Now they have to pay \u00a3880 if they want to put the super into Sunday. Industry sources say more than 20 different firms - including Bass and Whitbread, Channel 4, cable companies NTL and Telewest and telecom firm Kingston - have given evidence to the OFT. City sources say that, despite appearances, Sky, which isn't expected to turn a profit until 2003, is scared about the inquiry's possible outcome. </p> <p>Observers say Sky has done a 'brilliant' job in suppressing interest in the inquiry. Sky supporters have chanted the mantra that OFT inquiries are nothing new. In addition, media sources highlight the fact that the OFT recently released Sky from two regulatory commitments - chiefly to do with the way it provides accounts - as evidence that things may be looking up for the company. </p> <p>And Sky also points out that the media landscape has changed dramatically in recent months. Rivals are now launching their own channels. ONdigital will have its own premium sports channel later this year, for example. Telewest, meanwhile, produces hundreds of hours of its own content through Flextech, the company with which it merged two years ago. </p> <p>New technologies such as ADSL - phone lines carrying video signals - are now on the market. Consolidation of the cable industry from 40 players to two means Sky faces powerful rivals. So, the argument runs, why regulate the price it charges for content? </p> <p>But, significantly, the inquiry is the first launched under new OFT boss John Vickers. Media observers say Vickers would not have contemplated such a high-profile investigation unless he was sure there was a case to be answered. And, while OFT inquiries into Sky may be nothing new, this is the first to be launched under the new Competition Act, which gives investigators far greater powers than they wielded under the old Fair Trading Act. </p> <p>As well as a fine and the possible imposition of a new pricing structure, the inquiry could ultimately force Sky to adopt a Microsoft style break- up, separating its distribution and content divisions. This option does not look likely, however. 'I don't think anybody believes the OFT will make them divide into two parts.

A pariah week: the week of the News of the World 's Sophie sting, the week an \u00a38 million trial in Hull suddenly ended and the editor of the Sunday Mirror, just as suddenly, lost his job. </p> <p>But the crescendo of vituperation, this time round, was subtly different. It came not from the politicians, who grow circumspect when there's an election to fight, nor even from a Buckingham Palace press machine which had blunderingly made a bad scene much worse. No, the charge against Rebekah Wade of the NoW and the Mirror 's hapless Colin Myler was led by other papers as dog savaged dog. </p> <p>Call the Independent : 'The News of the World 's public interest defence of its entrapment is utterly feeble; the newspaper deserves the strongest censure from the PCC. The tittle-tattle exposed by this sting cannot possibly justify the use of deception.' </p> <p>Call the Telegraph , denouncing Sophie's humiliation as 'brutality and cowardice mingled'.

A pariah week: the week of the News of the World 's Sophie sting, the week an \u00a38 million trial in Hull suddenly ended and the editor of the Sunday Mirror, just as suddenly, lost his job. But the crescendo of vituperation, this time round, was subtly different. It came not from the politicians, who grow circumspect when there's an election to fight, nor even from a Buckingham Palace press machine which had blunderingly made a bad scene much worse. No, the charge against Rebekah Wade of the NoW and the Mirror 's hapless Colin Myler was led by other papers as dog savaged dog. Call the Independent : 'The News of the World 's public interest defence of its entrapment is utterly feeble; the newspaper deserves the strongest censure from the PCC. The tittle-tattle exposed by this sting cannot possibly justify the use of deception.' Call the Telegraph , denouncing Sophie's humiliation as 'brutality and cowardice mingled'. What, it inquired, 'is happening to the tabloid press? There is a role for rough-and-ready journalism that exposes scandals of real public interest. Instead the Sunday Mirror , like the News of the World , seems intent on reversing declining circulation by desperate measures.' The Guardian thought the Sunday Mirror had been 'idiotic' over its contempt of court and observed bleakly that 'the greater the [ NoW ] intrusion, the bigger the sales'. Dominic Lawson in the Sunday Telegraph railed against 'the treachery of a disaffected ex-employee' (the whistleblower who shopped the Countess of Wessex). The Sun skipped for joy over its front page headline - 'What a Sunday Mirror Cock-up'. Now some of this, of course, was pretty self-serving. The editors of the Sun and the Mirror (that 'cocky chancer' Piers Morgan, according to David Yelland of the Sun ) manifestly loathe each other. Rival groups will always put the boot in come what may. (The Daily Express's conclusion that the Myler debacle came because he was 'faced with declining circulation' was, in context, as ripe as they come). But beyond it you could see the canyon that divides national newspapers. Call David Aaronovitch in the Indie: 'These horrible rags are ruining people's lives.' There was no instant edge of fear to the reaction - because the politicians were otherwise engaged. Neither Tony Blair nor William Hague is going to threaten fresh legal retribution for the press. Both are much too busy trying to get elected. There are looming problems from a judiciary seemingly bent on writing its own ad hoc privacy laws after the incorporation of the European Convention into British law, but these are as yet inchoate. For once, journalists and editors felt free to say what they thought for themselves - as citizens, neighbours, human beings. Call Simon Jenkins in the Times : 'A profession has a code of practice, rules of fairness and confidentiality,' he wrote. 'But the business of newspapers is so overwhelmed by market competition that most constraint has gone by the board.' Though Jenkins doubled back to find some good in this anarchy, he nevertheless still wants legal sanctions on press freedom, just as he did when he sat a decade ago on the Calcutt committee.
