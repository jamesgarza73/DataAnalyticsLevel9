Gabrielle Ready plays Noreen with such lumpy, luminous grace that the play makes you want to rush off to churchyards to find your own angel. Till June 17. Box office: 020-7478 0100.",

The bank, which claims to be the country's biggest on the internet with 1m customers, tried to demonstrate the diversity of its cyberspace clientele by citing the example of a 99-year-old who registered for the online bank last month. David Weymouth, chief information officer, said that while Barclays was spending \u00a3325m on the internet - which helped it squeeze 4% of costs out of its retail bank last year- it would also spend \u00a3100m on revamping its branch network, the source of much of its negative publicity in recent months. \"From the customer side we're convinced that the right strategy is to deliver to as many customers as possible a broad range of services across multiple channels.\" While the bank insists it will not prevent internet customers using branches or telephone banking, it will launch an internet-only savings account later in the year. Of the \u00a3325m to be spent this year on the net, \u00a3180m will be devoted to core infrastructure, \u00a375m to \"business to customer\" initiatives and \u00a370m for \"business to business\". The bank's shares rose by 29p to \u00a316.51 even though analysts expressed some scepticism that the benefits of the spending would feed through to the bank's profits.",

      "bodyText": "Carpetbaggers pushing for demutualisation of Standard Life yesterday held out the prospect of a long and bitter battle for control of the insurer if it fails to achieve a convincing victory in next month's vote on flotation. The threat was made as the group of rebel members led by Fred Woollard, a Monaco-based investor, mounted a fresh attack on the insurer, accusing it of \"misleading\" policyholders over the size of potential windfalls and stoking fears that people would lose out as a result of conversion. The rebels held a press conference at the offices of their public relations firm to give their response to Standard Life's defence document. Mr Woollard conceded that obtaining the 75% majority necessary for demutualisation was a high hurdle. Some commentators are predicting a vote in favour of between 50% and 75%, which would leave the 175-year-old company \"terribly vulnerable to someone making a takeover bid for it\", Mr Woollard said. In the event of such a result, it was likely his action group would mount a challenge to the board, which could mean a number of the dissident policyholders standing for election in an attempt to force a change of heart on the issue. Among disputed points is the size of potential windfalls. The rebel members said the average handout to the 2.3m qualifying policyholders could be \u00a35,000-\u00a36,300 but Standard Life estimated that about half its members would receive less than \u00a32,500, with fewer than 20% likely to get \u00a36,000 or more.

The seam bowling exhibited an overall ruthlessness - characterised by Andy Caddick's no-nonsense bouncer to Pommie Mbangwa that wound up proceedings - that it has often lacked in the past. When one bowler went off the boil another stepped into the breach and that is individualism within a team context. </p> <p>But it is important to be clear about the quality of the opposition. Over the years Zimbabwe have given England a tough time in one-day cricket and held their own when the sides played tests in Africa. Just a couple of months ago in Port of Spain they had played themselves into a position to canter home against West Indies, even if they did freeze rigid and blow the game. </p> <p>But their performance in this test was that of a middling county and no more. They experienced no luck at all, first with the toss (although Nasser Hussain, bizarrely given the conditions, has said that he came close to batting first before changing his mind while the coin was in the air), then with edges that failed to go to hand, crucial chances that were not taken, third-umpire decisions that went against them and even the worse of the light. In this they were all too reminiscent of England over the years. </p> <p>But it was not just luck Zimbabwe were short of. They were technically deficient against the moving ball, devoid of application, mundane with the ball (Heath Streak excepted), overawed by the occasion and lacklustre in the field - the one area in which they can compete with anyone in the world - with Andy Flower a disaster behind the stumps. </p> <p>It is a matter of record that teams which suffer first up against England tend to come back stronger for the second Test (one reason for England's hitherto poor showing at Lord's, which normally comes later in the calendar) and Zimbabwe, surely, cannot play as poorly again now that the first one is out of the way. </p> <p>This is not to denigrate the England performance, however. With the exception of their failure to push on their innings on Saturday afternoon when they knew there might be rain around over the following two days, it was a first-rate effort that no doubt will be rewarded with an unchanged side for the second Test, which starts at Trent Bridge on Thursday week. </p> <p>This may be galling for one centrally contracted player, Michael Vaughan, who presumably will be up and running for Yorkshire after his hand injury heals. </p> <p>There was enough in Nick Knight's performance to keep him in a winning side. Such is fortune's fickle finger: the onus will be on Vaughan now to score runs for his county and for Knight (or someone else) to fail if the Yorkshire batsman is to regain the place that had seemed his once he had gained his contract. </p> <p>The same goes for Chris Silverwood. Ed Giddins did all that was asked of him and more, although he was given prime conditions in which to bowl and ideal opposition against which to succeed. </p> <p>He may not find such easy pickings again. However, his clever use of swing (the inswinger that deceived Brian Murphy into offering no shot was a cracker) balanced Caddick's seam and bounce and Darren Gough's robust pace and might well be a potent weapon in unsettling the West Indies' battery of left-handers later in the summer. </p> <p>Although there is nothing to stop further players being placed under central contract, there are no plans to add Giddins or anyone else to the current list. David Graveney, the chairman of selectors, believes the system provides security for the chosen dozen while offering incentive for others. </p> <p>This is also the first occasion on which the England management have had the option after a test of withdrawing contracted players from forthcoming county fixtures for rest, recuperation and practice while insisting that others play. </p> <p>So Mark Ramprakash will be looking to gain some form at Northampton on Wednesday and Graeme Hick will be hoping to continue his at Bristol. Andy Flintoff and Chris Schofield will be at Southampton tomorrow (where one hopes the leg-spinner takes the opportunity to seek a masterclass from Shane Warne); Knight, together with Giddins, over whom Duncan Fletcher has no jurisdiction outside the tests, will be at Cardiff; and Craig White will be playing at Headingley against the Zimbabweans. </p> <p>Others, though - Nasser Hussain, Mike Atherton, Alec Stewart, Gough and Caddick - will be taking a break. </p> <p>Like the England captain, Atherton has already expressed his enthusiasm for the idea of spending a number of days in meaningful practice, and time out will limit the strain on his dicky back. </p> <p>Likewise the fragile state of Stewart's hands demands that he stays out of the firing line, as does the imperative to keep the two fast bowlers fit and firing for the duration of an arduous summer of seven tests.

People seem to have short memories.\" Earlier, Hussain said: \"Chris did something that seriously upset my team and I'm a firm believer in backing my team at all times. I've got nothing against Chris and enjoyed his company in the winter, but on this occasion I felt I had to act and let the ECB decide if they should take action.\" Adams said: \"I'm still in shock at the accusations. I haven't spoken to Nasser since the incident but as far as I'm concerned he remains a friend, a great leader and exactly the right man to lead his country at the moment. \"I felt there was very little wrong with my actions during the events that occurred. The match was a month ago but I only found out a week ago. \"I believe myself to be a nice bloke and a fair bloke. I play the game to win, have always done so and will never change that. I admit that at times I get pumped up and if that causes offence then so be it. I cannot change the way I am.\"",

Both players were in the team who won the World Cup in Rome 10 years ago. </p> <p>H\u00e4ssler's inclusion in the 22-man squad, who will make up a team to face England on June 17, is something of a surprise. Only last month Ribbeck said it was \"unlikely\" that the veteran creative midfielder, who won the last of his 97 caps at France 98, would be picked for the European Championship.</p> <p>Last week he criticised the Milan forward Oliver Bierhoff for publicly telling the coach he should select H\u00e4ssler, along with the midfielders Stefan Effenberg and Mario Basler. \"We need players like [H\u00e4ssler] who are so good at sending in crosses,\" said Bierhoff.</p> <p>Ribbeck, who was hit by the withdrawal of Borussia Dortmund's key defender Christian W\u00f6rns with knee-ligament damage last week, justified his change of mind by saying: \"I saw him play against Hertha Berlin and he was involved in all the key moments. He played some deadly passes and was strong in the one-on-ones. It was an impressive performance.\"</p> <p>Of Bierhoff's wish list, Basler is overlooked, while Effenberg has refused to play for the national team.</p> <p>Ribbeck, who was not first choice for the job after Berti Vogts quit after France 98, has faced almost continual criticism during his two years as Germany produced a string of unimpressive performances. Worse still, a fair amount of it has come from his own players.</p> <p>The Bayern Munich midfielder Jens Jeremies slammed the national set-up as \"miserable\" earlier this month but, like Bierhoff, he is effectively too good to drop. He is one of the few younger players to emerge in recent years, evidencing a dearth of up-and-coming talent of which H\u00e4ssler's recall is a symptom.</p> <p>The squad contains six players from the German champions Bayern Munich and five from the runners-up Bayer Leverkusen.</p> <p>The minnows of Euro 2000, Slovenia, also announced their squad yesterday.

      "bodyText": "The Germany coach Erich Ribbeck decided to put his faith in experience yesterday when he recalled Thomas H\u00e4ssler, who will be 34 next week, after an absence of two years to a Euro 2000 squad which also includes the 39-year-old Lothar Matth\u00e4us. Both players were in the team who won the World Cup in Rome 10 years ago. H\u00e4ssler's inclusion in the 22-man squad, who will make up a team to face England on June 17, is something of a surprise. Only last month Ribbeck said it was \"unlikely\" that the veteran creative midfielder, who won the last of his 97 caps at France 98, would be picked for the European Championship. Last week he criticised the Milan forward Oliver Bierhoff for publicly telling the coach he should select H\u00e4ssler, along with the midfielders Stefan Effenberg and Mario Basler. \"We need players like [H\u00e4ssler] who are so good at sending in crosses,\" said Bierhoff. Ribbeck, who was hit by the withdrawal of Borussia Dortmund's key defender Christian W\u00f6rns with knee-ligament damage last week, justified his change of mind by saying: \"I saw him play against Hertha Berlin and he was involved in all the key moments. He played some deadly passes and was strong in the one-on-ones. It was an impressive performance.\" Of Bierhoff's wish list, Basler is overlooked, while Effenberg has refused to play for the national team. Ribbeck, who was not first choice for the job after Berti Vogts quit after France 98, has faced almost continual criticism during his two years as Germany produced a string of unimpressive performances. Worse still, a fair amount of it has come from his own players. The Bayern Munich midfielder Jens Jeremies slammed the national set-up as \"miserable\" earlier this month but, like Bierhoff, he is effectively too good to drop. He is one of the few younger players to emerge in recent years, evidencing a dearth of up-and-coming talent of which H\u00e4ssler's recall is a symptom. The squad contains six players from the German champions Bayern Munich and five from the runners-up Bayer Leverkusen. The minnows of Euro 2000, Slovenia, also announced their squad yesterday. The coach Srecko Katanec included Nova Gorica midfielder Anton Zlogar, 22, who has played only once for the national team. Germany squad Goalkeepers : Oliver Kahn (Bayern Munich), Jens Lehmann (Borussia Dortmund), Hans-J\u00f6rg Butt (Hamburg); Defenders : Markus Babbel, Thomas Linke (both Bayern Munich), Lothar Matth\u00e4us (NY-NJ Metrostars), Jens Nowotny (Bayer Leverkusen), Marko Rehmer (Hertha Berlin); Midfielders : Michael Ballack (Bayer Leverkusen), Sebastian Deisler (Hertha Berlin), Thomas H\u00e4ssler (TSV 1860 Munich), Dietmar Hamann (Liverpool), Jens Jeremies (Bayern Munich), Carsten Ramelow (Bayer Leverkusen), Mehmet Scholl (Bayern Munich), Dariusz Wosz (Hertha Berlin), Christian Ziege (Middlesbrough); Strikers : Oliver Bierhoff (Milan), Marco Bode (Werder Bremen), Carsten Jancker (Bayern Munich), Ulf Kirsten, Paolo Rink (both Bayer Leverkusen). Slovenia squad: Goalkeepers: Mladen Dabanovic (Lokeren, Belgium), Dejan Nemec (Murska Sobota), Marko Simeunovic (Maribor Teatanic); Defenders: Spasoje Bulajic (Cologne, Germany), Marinko Galic (Maribor), Aleksander Knavs (Tirol Innsbruck, Austria), Darko Milanic (Sturm Graz, Austria), Zeljko Milinovic (LASK Linz, Austria); Midfielders: Milenko Acimovic (Red Star Belgrade, Yugoslavia), Ales Ceh (GAK Graz, Austria), Saso Gajser (Ghent, Belgium), Rudi Istenic (KFC Urdingen, Germany), Amir Karic (Maribor), Miran Pavlin (Karlsruhe, Germany), Zoran Pavlovic (Dinamo Zagreb, Croatia), Dzoni Novak (Le Havre, France), Zlatko Zahovic (Olympiakos, Greece), Anton Zlogar (Nova Gorica); Strikers: Milan Osterc (Olimpija Ljubljana), Mladen Rudonja (St Truiden, Belgium), Ermin Siljak (Servette, Switzerland), Saso Udovic (LASK Linz, Austria)",

His manager Walter Smith has been rightly pleased with the cherubic 26-year-old, singing his praises whenever possible. </p> <p>Barmby started to be proclaimed as a player with international potential when he was at Tottenham and he won the first of his 10 caps in 1995.

I had a few injuries, double hernia, plus a battle with relegation. You can't play the way you can play. It's a battle every game and it was hard in the first two years. </p> <p>\"But in the last two years it's been a different story and I've been able to express myself more. Under Walter Smith we've played more of a passing game and it's benefitted me, and John Collins, more than most.

Yet Brazil have not won on their two previous visits to Cardiff. A draw in 1983 was followed by a 1-0 defeat in 1991 on - surprise, surprise - a small pitch with long grass. Romario, who was injured playing for Vasco da Gama on Sunday, will not be striking at all. He will not feature against England on Saturday either. \"There's a school of thought that you should pick easier friendlies when you are building up to World Cup qualifiers, but I don't go along with that,\" Hughes said. \"You can only progress if you test yourselves. Lesser matches produce a false sense of security.\" Security is not readily associated with Brazil's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo right now. He is under pressure after starting the World Cup campaign with a 0-0 draw in Colombia and an unconvincing 3-2 home win over Ecuador. He must do without Real Madrid's Roberto Carlos, who is preparing for tomorrow's Champions League final. Wales are missing the experience of Chris Coleman, Mark Pembridge, Nathan Blake and John Hartson, giving a chance for youngsters such as Matthew Jones and Mark Delaney to shine. Giggs will play, despite missing training yesterday to protect a minor thigh strain. Hughes is hoping for positives rather than miracles. \"Even in defeat you can feel you have done well,\" he said, \"if you have done as much as you can.\" Wales (possible 4-4-2): Crossley (Nottm For); Delaney (Aston Villa), Page (Watford), Melville (Fulham), Barnard (Barnsley); Robinson (Charlton), Savage (Leicester), Speed (Newcastle), M Jones (Leeds); Saunders (Bradford), Giggs (Manchester United). Brazil (possible 3-5-2): Dida; Antonio Carlos, Aldair, Cafu; Emerson, Rivaldo, Ze Roberto, Cesar Sampaio, Silvinho; Franca, Elber.",

There are probably too many mental associations with some of the other more dangerous '-stans', such as Afghanistan or Tadjikistan. It is, however, a place for TEFL adventurers to consider, and is especially suitable for those with some experience and a taste for a 'frontier' lifestyle.</p> <p>The country is located in Central Asia, between China and Russia, and covers more than a million square miles. Most of the country is steppe and desert, but with spectacular mountain ranges at its northern, southern and eastern edges. Although land-locked, it has access to the Caspian Sea, and also possesses a share of that great environmental nightmare, the remains of the Aral Sea. The climate tends to be a little on the extreme side, with winter temperatures regularly falling as low as -20C, while in summer the thermometer can reach a stifling 40C.</p> <p>Almost all of its 16 million inhabitants speak Russian, although Kazakh (a member of the Turkic group of languages) is the 'official' language. Accordingly the population is composed of 42% Kazakhs and 37% Russians, with the remainder comprising Koreans, Ukrainians, Germans, and other central Asian races. Religious activity also claims an equal split between Muslims (47%) and Russian Orthodox (44%). </p> <p>In short, the place is multi-cultural, in a Soviet sort of way, and multi ethnic. Moreover, it plays host to a whole range of attitudes and lifestyles that the average Westerner can only gaze at and puzzle over, far less even understand: a true melting pot of the typically Asian, the typically Russian; the old Soviet, the new capitalist. Respect for and deference towards authority is a way of getting by here - don't expect consultation or enlightened attitudes. </p> <p>In economic terms, since the collapse of the USSR in 1991 Kazakhstan has been obliged to look for its own way in the world. Its acceptance of Western capitalism has been the strongest of all the central Asian states, and therefore its progress has been quite unique. Although this passage has been accompanied with a typically Eastern style of authoritarianism and corruption, the country's pro-business posture means that demand for skills in the international language of English is steadily increasing. </p> <p>EFL provision here in the heart of Central Asia can be divided into two broad camps, the sponsored and the private. The sponsored sector was the first to try to satisfy the region's demand for English, so for this historical reason it tends to be the largest EFL provider here. Things are, however, changing rather quickly.</p> <p>2. <strong><a name=\"\" b>Teaching in Kazakhstan (Sponsored Organisations)</a></strong><br> Louise Cowcher is ELT Project Manager for the British Council here in Almaty (the country's former capital). She outlined their approach as being one of strictly responding to demand. Indicative of that demand is the fact that they are the only UCLES centre for the whole of Central Asia, examining and providing tuition for the whole suite of Cambridge exams. Moreover, they are also providing an ever-widening program of teacher development for local English teachers, addressing such areas as methodology, language improvement, and materials evaluation, as well as business English and Young Learners. There is also a good level of demand from the state too, and BC is collaborating on English language projects with both the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Defence. </p> <p>She sees the BC's role as one of ensuring quality ELT provision in what could be a huge market, and they are actively using the BC expertise gained in other FSU countries to help them in the challenge. In the near future they are hoping to set up a teaching centre, again in response to increasing demand. However, she is also keen to stress that their approach to ELT has been in collaboration with the other big players in the arena, namely US Peace Corps, the Soros Foundation, and USIS (United States Information Service). \"We have shared objectives\" she confirms, \"and this has led us to collaborate on various projects, such as EFL conferences, seminars and textbooks\". Currently the BC has 4 experienced teachers working in the Aksay gas fields, and these are earning money 'at the top of the range'.</p> <p>Other sponsored EFL providers here include, of course, the US Peace Corps, who appear to be in an equally expansionist mood. Last year they had 43 EFL volunteers in Kazakhstan as a whole, and this year there are 54. Next year should see a further increase in numbers, too. Another major US player here is USIS, and they have typically supplied at least two teaching fellows and teacher trainers to local institutes that requested them. </p> <p>Lisa Ponzetti, one of last year's cohort, points out that USIS go beyond just supplying teachers, and also make donations to local ELT associations and possess a resource centre and library for teachers and students of English. She also underlines that \"the quality of the teaching experience in Kazakhstan would not be appropriate for a 'first-stepper'\", and that \"although it is a wonderful experience, the pay is not so good in some private places\".</p> <p>However, some ELT providers appear to be cutting back on some aspects of their English Language programmes. The Soros Organisation, for instance, which not so long ago had ten teaching fellows working in the country, now has none at all. Their spokesperson, Yulia Leonova, stated that the English Language programme in Kazakhstan is now effectively closed due to \"a regression in the donors' outlook\". But she did remain upbeat about the future, claiming that the current situation \"will hopefully lead to a strong impulse to a new growth of ELT quality and the ELT community's activity\".</p> <p>International House also have a tentative presence here, through their co-operation with The Soros Foundation Language School. Its Director, Mira Khodjashova, is keen to stress the positive changes of recent years. Nowadays, she notes, good English language skills mean a good job with promising career prospects and a high salary, especially now that foreign interest in the country has 'exploded' due to Kazakhstan's virtually unlimited resources of oil and gas. She contrasts the current demand for 'communicative English' with the situation under Soviet times, when English was only needed for the 'academic' purposes of translation and reading. \"When I was graduating\" she smiles, \"everybody thought I was crazy for having gone to the Institute of Languages. The specialisation of English teacher was one of the most unclaimed professions: now it is one of the most popular, and everybody is dying to learn English\". </p> <p>3. <strong><a name=\"\" c>Teaching in Kazakhstan (Private/Commercial Scene)</a></strong><br> Clearly, the economic changes of the past decade have had a tremendous impact on the ELT market, and as a result many clients now like to insist on a native speaker teacher. However, it is extremely difficult to attract NS teachers to the region. Despite this, many private schools have popped up to satisfy the locals' demand for English, although few of them offer NS teachers, and in most cases the quality of provision is sometimes questionable. Moreover, one informed observer told me that some private schools tend to treat their staff rather like 'bonded labour', while others fail to live up to the promises made in the teachers' contracts. Caveat Emptor!</p> <p>A possible example of a decent private EFL school here is the Anglo-Kazakh centre, which has been providing tuition in general and business English for two years now. At present they employ 4 native speakers, all from England and CerTEFL qualified, with experience in working in such places as Taiwan, Kuwait, Russia, Turkey and Italy. Their remarks on the advantages and the drawbacks of working in the country noted that management styles are definitely not European, tending to be quite autocratic. Expect to be told what to do, rather than be consulted. The teaching load was 27 hours, for $800 per month, plus a possible $1000 bonus at the end of the contract, and this seemed to compare quite favourably with some other private schools in Almaty, which is where the great majority of the country's private sector EFL teaching goes on, being Kazakhstan's business centre.</p> <p>Private teaching work appears to attract between $15 and $25 per hour, and is in rather plentiful supply, given the high level of demand. A final word from Andy Maunder, teacher at the Anglo-Kazakh centre, echoes a lot of the above: \"If you want everything to run smoothly, Kazakhstan is not the place for you. But if you're ready to roll with the punches, you can get to like it here\".</p> <p>4. <strong><a name=\"\" d>Contemporary Kazakhstan</a></strong><br> Kazakhstan obviously experienced a great deal of social and political upheaval at the time of its 'divorce' from the USSR, and partly as a result of this their attempts at democracy became quite authoritarian. Parliament was dissolved by the President after the first two years of independence, and since then he has ruled virtually by decree. Modern critics point to the presence of what they see as 'crony capitalism', in which strong presidential power and patronism have led to the establishment of an elite ruling class with strong personal and kinship ties to the President. </p> <p>At the other end of the scale, long term high levels of unemployment are dragging down one part of the nation into a poverty and indignity unseen during the Soviet period. Many of the people that can be seen around the city selling cigarettes and knick-knacks from grimy cardboard boxes are educated people, former doctors, engineers and teachers, who are unable to find work in the contracting state sector, and are without other skills to offer the new regime. </p> <p>But there is oil and gas - a lot of it: and an allegedly pro-Western nation on the borders of China and close to the militant moslem hotspots of Afghanistan, Tadjikistan and Iran. Most governments can recognise an ally when they see one, so democratic European nations will probably continue to pump money in to try and 'democratise' a country that has neither experience nor traditions of democracy, and which probably never will. Observers point to a typically South East Asian style of government, as exists in Malaysia and even Indonesia, in which a facade of western-style democracy is apparent, but in which real power rests with an almost permanent ruling elite. Small wonder then, that many people see English as their passport to a new life outside the country - and several million have left since independence in 1991.</p> <p>5. <strong><a name=\"\" e>Living in Almaty</a></strong><br> Let's cast aside the problems and see what sort of a lifestyle Almaty can offer the prospective EFL teacher. Long gone are the days of grey shops and restaurants doling out unappetising produce: now there are plenty of pubs and discos, even gay bars, where you can spend your money, but they are not cheap. Turkish restaurants also appear to be popping up at a gathering pace. Accommodation is freely available too, from dull one-roomed flats in the outskirts to wonderful refurbished apartments near the centre of town. But be prepared to spend from $100 to $600 for your living quarters, and don't be at all surprised to find yourself without heating, water or gas for anything up to a couple of days at a time. Such are the delights of living in a 'transition society'!</p> <p>Travel is another problem. Given the country's enormous size, it seems to take a couple of days to get anywhere: and because of the country's antiquated transport system, those two days can be very uncomfortable! However, there is plenty to see and do near Almaty. If you're keen on mountaineering, rock-climbing, skiing or just gazing at spectacular scenery, this place will definitely keep you occupied. Equally, if you're a fan of drinking vodka and eating horsemeat, either before, after or even during a beautiful steam bath, you won't be left disappointed.</p> <p>6. <strong><a name=\"\" f>Career Prospects</a></strong><br> So where does all this leave the average EFL professional? Well, take a look at the developing countries of South East Asia, and translate that into Kazakhstan 10 or 15 years into the future. Result? Plenty of jobs, hopefully. There are, however, certain drawbacks. Seamus Bennett is Director of the English Language Programme of the Kazakhstan Institute of Management, Economics and Research, where all tuition is given in English. He remarks that Central Asia is not perceived as an exciting destination by the average TEFL backpacker (unlike Poland or Hungary, for example), and that this has held back ELT provision in the region. Moreover, the region is quite isolated, physically, intellectually and politically, from even Eastern Europe, and this has resulted in the constrained development that has taken place so far. There's also the extreme climate to consider - around minus 15 in Winter here in Almaty, plus the occasional earth tremor. All of this will very probably deter future EFL professionals from considering working here. </p> <p>However, the region does undoubtedly have its attractions, especially for an experienced teacher. The BC's Louise Cowcher explained that those with a background in teacher-training, plus other suitably 'mature' candidates, would find the place welcoming of their skills. \"Others may find it difficult to adapt\", she said, \"although Almaty is by no means a 'hardship' area, and is comparable or even favourable to many current teaching locations in the former Soviet Union\". According to her there is \"an awful lot of demand\" and \"lots of potential\" here.</p> <p>However, don't dust off your passport and jump on that plane to Almaty just yet. The country is still 'closed', in that it's impossible to get here without a visa, and these are only obtainable as a tourist or an employee. In short, you'll need to find your job in Kazakhstan before you even set foot in the place, and for those of you who are adventurous enough to want to do so, the following list of contacts should be useful.</p> <p>7. <strong><a name=\"\" g>Contacts</a></strong> <br>Anyone interested in working in Kazakhstan is welcome to contact either <a href=\"mailto:seab@kimep.kz\">Seamus Bennett</a> or <a href=\"mailto:bragg@kimep.kz\">Jeff Bragg</a> for an update on the current situation.

Moreover, it plays host to a whole range of attitudes and lifestyles that the average Westerner can only gaze at and puzzle over, far less even understand: a true melting pot of the typically Asian, the typically Russian; the old Soviet, the new capitalist. Respect for and deference towards authority is a way of getting by here - don't expect consultation or enlightened attitudes. In economic terms, since the collapse of the USSR in 1991 Kazakhstan has been obliged to look for its own way in the world. Its acceptance of Western capitalism has been the strongest of all the central Asian states, and therefore its progress has been quite unique. Although this passage has been accompanied with a typically Eastern style of authoritarianism and corruption, the country's pro-business posture means that demand for skills in the international language of English is steadily increasing. EFL provision here in the heart of Central Asia can be divided into two broad camps, the sponsored and the private. The sponsored sector was the first to try to satisfy the region's demand for English, so for this historical reason it tends to be the largest EFL provider here. Things are, however, changing rather quickly. 2. Teaching in Kazakhstan (Sponsored Organisations) Louise Cowcher is ELT Project Manager for the British Council here in Almaty (the country's former capital). She outlined their approach as being one of strictly responding to demand. Indicative of that demand is the fact that they are the only UCLES centre for the whole of Central Asia, examining and providing tuition for the whole suite of Cambridge exams. Moreover, they are also providing an ever-widening program of teacher development for local English teachers, addressing such areas as methodology, language improvement, and materials evaluation, as well as business English and Young Learners. There is also a good level of demand from the state too, and BC is collaborating on English language projects with both the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Defence. She sees the BC's role as one of ensuring quality ELT provision in what could be a huge market, and they are actively using the BC expertise gained in other FSU countries to help them in the challenge. In the near future they are hoping to set up a teaching centre, again in response to increasing demand. However, she is also keen to stress that their approach to ELT has been in collaboration with the other big players in the arena, namely US Peace Corps, the Soros Foundation, and USIS (United States Information Service). \"We have shared objectives\" she confirms, \"and this has led us to collaborate on various projects, such as EFL conferences, seminars and textbooks\". Currently the BC has 4 experienced teachers working in the Aksay gas fields, and these are earning money 'at the top of the range'. Other sponsored EFL providers here include, of course, the US Peace Corps, who appear to be in an equally expansionist mood. Last year they had 43 EFL volunteers in Kazakhstan as a whole, and this year there are 54. Next year should see a further increase in numbers, too. Another major US player here is USIS, and they have typically supplied at least two teaching fellows and teacher trainers to local institutes that requested them. Lisa Ponzetti, one of last year's cohort, points out that USIS go beyond just supplying teachers, and also make donations to local ELT associations and possess a resource centre and library for teachers and students of English. She also underlines that \"the quality of the teaching experience in Kazakhstan would not be appropriate for a 'first-stepper'\", and that \"although it is a wonderful experience, the pay is not so good in some private places\". However, some ELT providers appear to be cutting back on some aspects of their English Language programmes. The Soros Organisation, for instance, which not so long ago had ten teaching fellows working in the country, now has none at all. Their spokesperson, Yulia Leonova, stated that the English Language programme in Kazakhstan is now effectively closed due to \"a regression in the donors' outlook\". But she did remain upbeat about the future, claiming that the current situation \"will hopefully lead to a strong impulse to a new growth of ELT quality and the ELT community's activity\". International House also have a tentative presence here, through their co-operation with The Soros Foundation Language School. Its Director, Mira Khodjashova, is keen to stress the positive changes of recent years. Nowadays, she notes, good English language skills mean a good job with promising career prospects and a high salary, especially now that foreign interest in the country has 'exploded' due to Kazakhstan's virtually unlimited resources of oil and gas. She contrasts the current demand for 'communicative English' with the situation under Soviet times, when English was only needed for the 'academic' purposes of translation and reading. \"When I was graduating\" she smiles, \"everybody thought I was crazy for having gone to the Institute of Languages. The specialisation of English teacher was one of the most unclaimed professions: now it is one of the most popular, and everybody is dying to learn English\". 3. Teaching in Kazakhstan (Private/Commercial Scene) Clearly, the economic changes of the past decade have had a tremendous impact on the ELT market, and as a result many clients now like to insist on a native speaker teacher. However, it is extremely difficult to attract NS teachers to the region. Despite this, many private schools have popped up to satisfy the locals' demand for English, although few of them offer NS teachers, and in most cases the quality of provision is sometimes questionable. Moreover, one informed observer told me that some private schools tend to treat their staff rather like 'bonded labour', while others fail to live up to the promises made in the teachers' contracts. Caveat Emptor! A possible example of a decent private EFL school here is the Anglo-Kazakh centre, which has been providing tuition in general and business English for two years now. At present they employ 4 native speakers, all from England and CerTEFL qualified, with experience in working in such places as Taiwan, Kuwait, Russia, Turkey and Italy. Their remarks on the advantages and the drawbacks of working in the country noted that management styles are definitely not European, tending to be quite autocratic. Expect to be told what to do, rather than be consulted. The teaching load was 27 hours, for $800 per month, plus a possible $1000 bonus at the end of the contract, and this seemed to compare quite favourably with some other private schools in Almaty, which is where the great majority of the country's private sector EFL teaching goes on, being Kazakhstan's business centre. Private teaching work appears to attract between $15 and $25 per hour, and is in rather plentiful supply, given the high level of demand. A final word from Andy Maunder, teacher at the Anglo-Kazakh centre, echoes a lot of the above: \"If you want everything to run smoothly, Kazakhstan is not the place for you. But if you're ready to roll with the punches, you can get to like it here\". 4. Contemporary Kazakhstan Kazakhstan obviously experienced a great deal of social and political upheaval at the time of its 'divorce' from the USSR, and partly as a result of this their attempts at democracy became quite authoritarian. Parliament was dissolved by the President after the first two years of independence, and since then he has ruled virtually by decree. Modern critics point to the presence of what they see as 'crony capitalism', in which strong presidential power and patronism have led to the establishment of an elite ruling class with strong personal and kinship ties to the President. At the other end of the scale, long term high levels of unemployment are dragging down one part of the nation into a poverty and indignity unseen during the Soviet period. Many of the people that can be seen around the city selling cigarettes and knick-knacks from grimy cardboard boxes are educated people, former doctors, engineers and teachers, who are unable to find work in the contracting state sector, and are without other skills to offer the new regime. But there is oil and gas - a lot of it: and an allegedly pro-Western nation on the borders of China and close to the militant moslem hotspots of Afghanistan, Tadjikistan and Iran. Most governments can recognise an ally when they see one, so democratic European nations will probably continue to pump money in to try and 'democratise' a country that has neither experience nor traditions of democracy, and which probably never will. Observers point to a typically South East Asian style of government, as exists in Malaysia and even Indonesia, in which a facade of western-style democracy is apparent, but in which real power rests with an almost permanent ruling elite. Small wonder then, that many people see English as their passport to a new life outside the country - and several million have left since independence in 1991. 5. Living in Almaty Let's cast aside the problems and see what sort of a lifestyle Almaty can offer the prospective EFL teacher. Long gone are the days of grey shops and restaurants doling out unappetising produce: now there are plenty of pubs and discos, even gay bars, where you can spend your money, but they are not cheap. Turkish restaurants also appear to be popping up at a gathering pace. Accommodation is freely available too, from dull one-roomed flats in the outskirts to wonderful refurbished apartments near the centre of town. But be prepared to spend from $100 to $600 for your living quarters, and don't be at all surprised to find yourself without heating, water or gas for anything up to a couple of days at a time. Such are the delights of living in a 'transition society'! Travel is another problem. Given the country's enormous size, it seems to take a couple of days to get anywhere: and because of the country's antiquated transport system, those two days can be very uncomfortable! However, there is plenty to see and do near Almaty. If you're keen on mountaineering, rock-climbing, skiing or just gazing at spectacular scenery, this place will definitely keep you occupied. Equally, if you're a fan of drinking vodka and eating horsemeat, either before, after or even during a beautiful steam bath, you won't be left disappointed. 6. Career Prospects So where does all this leave the average EFL professional? Well, take a look at the developing countries of South East Asia, and translate that into Kazakhstan 10 or 15 years into the future. Result? Plenty of jobs, hopefully. There are, however, certain drawbacks. Seamus Bennett is Director of the English Language Programme of the Kazakhstan Institute of Management, Economics and Research, where all tuition is given in English. He remarks that Central Asia is not perceived as an exciting destination by the average TEFL backpacker (unlike Poland or Hungary, for example), and that this has held back ELT provision in the region. Moreover, the region is quite isolated, physically, intellectually and politically, from even Eastern Europe, and this has resulted in the constrained development that has taken place so far. There's also the extreme climate to consider - around minus 15 in Winter here in Almaty, plus the occasional earth tremor. All of this will very probably deter future EFL professionals from considering working here. However, the region does undoubtedly have its attractions, especially for an experienced teacher. The BC's Louise Cowcher explained that those with a background in teacher-training, plus other suitably 'mature' candidates, would find the place welcoming of their skills. \"Others may find it difficult to adapt\", she said, \"although Almaty is by no means a 'hardship' area, and is comparable or even favourable to many current teaching locations in the former Soviet Union\". According to her there is \"an awful lot of demand\" and \"lots of potential\" here. However, don't dust off your passport and jump on that plane to Almaty just yet. The country is still 'closed', in that it's impossible to get here without a visa, and these are only obtainable as a tourist or an employee. In short, you'll need to find your job in Kazakhstan before you even set foot in the place, and for those of you who are adventurous enough to want to do so, the following list of contacts should be useful. 7.

He is carrying the can for the failure of the government's supposedly robust systems for monitoring the testing of genetically modified food and crops, the month-long delay in admitting the mistake of allowing contaminated seed to be planted, the alleged cover-up associated with it and the muted official announcement through a written Parliamentary answer last Wednesday. </p> <p>Everyone loves to hate a scapegoat, particularly if it is the Ministry of Agriculture. It is easy to put the boot in too. After all, its complacency helped take the BSE crisis into the most expensive peacetime disaster in generations, its officials are routinely ridiculed in Whitehall for apparent slavish loyalty to intensive farming methods, and Mr Brown himself had a bad beef war politically and presentationally in the row with France over the resumption of British exports last year.</p> <p>But the latest GM failure was a collective failure. After all, this is a government which prides itself on its joined-upness. Until a couple of weeks ago, the presentation of GM issues was a matter for a special unit within the Cabinet Office. All media inquiries were expected to go through it, including about the siting of trial sites for GM crops, even though Michael Meacher, the environment minister, was the man who announced the first batch of them back in March.</p> <p>But then the going started getting tough. First, the number of trial sites was quite plainly going to be nowhere near the 80 first promised this year. Then a trial crop site was announced for Wales, when officials had earlier said the country would effectively be GM-free for three years of trials because it did not traditionally grow the crops which would have a GM alternative.

      "bodyText": "Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, is under siege again. He is carrying the can for the failure of the government's supposedly robust systems for monitoring the testing of genetically modified food and crops, the month-long delay in admitting the mistake of allowing contaminated seed to be planted, the alleged cover-up associated with it and the muted official announcement through a written Parliamentary answer last Wednesday. Everyone loves to hate a scapegoat, particularly if it is the Ministry of Agriculture. It is easy to put the boot in too. After all, its complacency helped take the BSE crisis into the most expensive peacetime disaster in generations, its officials are routinely ridiculed in Whitehall for apparent slavish loyalty to intensive farming methods, and Mr Brown himself had a bad beef war politically and presentationally in the row with France over the resumption of British exports last year. But the latest GM failure was a collective failure. After all, this is a government which prides itself on its joined-upness. Until a couple of weeks ago, the presentation of GM issues was a matter for a special unit within the Cabinet Office. All media inquiries were expected to go through it, including about the siting of trial sites for GM crops, even though Michael Meacher, the environment minister, was the man who announced the first batch of them back in March. But then the going started getting tough. First, the number of trial sites was quite plainly going to be nowhere near the 80 first promised this year. Then a trial crop site was announced for Wales, when officials had earlier said the country would effectively be GM-free for three years of trials because it did not traditionally grow the crops which would have a GM alternative. This was plainly wrong, since Aventis, one of the companies involved in the trials, thought the borderlands of England and Wales ideal for such tests. And then came the ultimate embarrassment. Farmers had planted two sowings of oil seed rape from seeds grown on the Canadian prairies and contaminated with GM material. Suddenly calls to the Cabinet Office were referred to the agriculture ministry, the Department for the Environment and the Food Standards Agency, although presumably the blessed Mo Mowlam's officials agreed the way the matter was finally made (sort of) public. The Cabinet Office has the bare-faced cheek to say it was most appropriate for Nick Brown's team to handle the fall-out from this fiasco since \"it is a story about seed purity\".

      "body": "<p><strong>YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST</strong></p> <p>When Joe Kinnear was told to fjord off by Wimbledon's Norwegian owners last summer, it wasn't just Mystic Fiver who saw the interaction of Mars as a sure sign that the most rotund man in football would soon be back managing a big club. But as the months ticked by, a few started expressing doubts. And those doubts turned to outright scepticism when Kinnear expressed interest in the Celtic, Blackburn and Fulham jobs - only to be cruelly rebuffed at every turn. </p> <p>Where are the doubters now? In hiding probably - because according to Reuters, Kinnear will be named as manager of Sheffield Wednesday tomorrow. It doesn't get much bigger than that. Well, not as far as Jumping Joe Ashton MP is concerned. \"I'd be delighted if he was appointed,\" Ashton, who notoriously called for Danny Wilson's dismissal earlier this year, told the Fiver exclusively. \"He's got a track record of getting a lot from very little money. More importantly he has teams that fight. Wednesday were an absolutely bloody disgrace this season. Bradford fought with true Yorkshire grit while Wednesday laid down before Christmas.\"</p> <p>The Fiver was ready to end it there but once Joe was off he wouldn't stop. \"I met with Joe Kinnear at Wembley and he told me he was up for it,\" he continued. \"And I suggested this to the board after the 8-0 defeat. I begged Dave Richards to appoint him but he wouldn't do it. The trouble was that Wednesday team were like a good horse without a jockey. If Joe Kinnear would have come in before Christmas they would have stayed up.\" At least he didn't say 'I told you so'.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>SIGN UP FOR THE EURO</strong></p> <p>The Euro, the Fiver's extra low-down from the lowlands brought to you in association with breathe, starts on the morning of June 5.

Had depressing chat with Tecos Guadalajara about midfielder Roberto Palacios. Find out he plays for Peru. Cah! I'm not landing myself with another player like Nobby Solano who's always away on international duty. Flipping South America. Decide to leave for Europe.</p> <p>Today</p> <p>On plane to Paris for tomorrow's Big Cup final. Note that Atletico Madrid striker Kiko is available for \u00a34.5m. Consider talking to representatives tomorrow and making bid. Doze off for a while, dreaming of a \u00a33m offer for Benfica midfielder Calado, and the secret deal for a big-name European striker which people say I'm keeping under my hat. Wake up, tittering.</p> <p>Today (later) </p> <p>Still on plane. A bit bored, so speak to Portuguese FA on new-fangled jet phone. Push them on decision over defender Fernando Meira, who has walked out on Vitoria Guimaraes in a row over wages and may be a free agent. But if the Portuguese FA decide he's still under contract, he'll cost me \u00a32.5m. They can whistle.</p> <p>Today (even later) </p> <p>Been on this plane far too long. Where's Paris? Become agitated when bids for Blackburn pair Damien Duff and Matt Jansen are turned down. Bah! That's it! Decide Fulham can go to hell if they want Didier Domi in exchange for Lee Clark. And as for this irritating Hugh Grant film they're showing... stewardess!</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"You can't buy a player, moreover a forward, and then drop him if he doesn't score in two matches - especially when he cost as much as I did. Oh, the stupidity and the hypocrisy of people who change sides today\" - Nicolas Anelka in L'Equipe. He was dropped by Real. That's all we can say, really.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>LET'S HEAR IT FOR GALATASARAY!</strong></p> <p>We all love Galatasaray. Nobody who watched their progress to the Euro-Vase this season can fail to have been won over by the charm of their fans, the straight-talking nature of their officials, and the honesty of their players (even when spinning six feet in the air after a challenge). So who will begrudge this ground-breaking sporting organisation a reward of \u00a317m from the Turkish government? Certainly not the Fiver, but a few Turks might.</p> <p>The Fiver has been deluged - alright, slightly annoyed - by emails today complaining in finest Turklish about the multi-million bonus Gala are set to receive. \"What about the earthquake victims?\" they ask. \"What about establishing a sound economic base upon which to secure entry into the European Union?\" they also ask, rather long-windedly. Finally, and perhaps most pertinently, they wonder: \"Why are Gala getting squillions when members of the Korac Cup-winning Efes Pilsen basketball team got a pen-and-tie combination set?\"</p> <p>If only the Fiver, sounding board for the world's football problems, could provide an answer. Particularly one that wasn't potentially libellous. Sadly, all we can do is observe another stroke of Gala good luck - a joint shirt-sponsorship deal with lowly neighbours Istanbulspor which should net the pair in the region of \u00a316m.

      "bodyText": "YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST When Joe Kinnear was told to fjord off by Wimbledon's Norwegian owners last summer, it wasn't just Mystic Fiver who saw the interaction of Mars as a sure sign that the most rotund man in football would soon be back managing a big club. But as the months ticked by, a few started expressing doubts. And those doubts turned to outright scepticism when Kinnear expressed interest in the Celtic, Blackburn and Fulham jobs - only to be cruelly rebuffed at every turn. Where are the doubters now? In hiding probably - because according to Reuters, Kinnear will be named as manager of Sheffield Wednesday tomorrow. It doesn't get much bigger than that. Well, not as far as Jumping Joe Ashton MP is concerned. \"I'd be delighted if he was appointed,\" Ashton, who notoriously called for Danny Wilson's dismissal earlier this year, told the Fiver exclusively. \"He's got a track record of getting a lot from very little money. More importantly he has teams that fight. Wednesday were an absolutely bloody disgrace this season. Bradford fought with true Yorkshire grit while Wednesday laid down before Christmas.\" The Fiver was ready to end it there but once Joe was off he wouldn't stop. \"I met with Joe Kinnear at Wembley and he told me he was up for it,\" he continued. \"And I suggested this to the board after the 8-0 defeat. I begged Dave Richards to appoint him but he wouldn't do it. The trouble was that Wednesday team were like a good horse without a jockey. If Joe Kinnear would have come in before Christmas they would have stayed up.\" At least he didn't say 'I told you so'. * * * * * * * * * * * * * SIGN UP FOR THE EURO The Euro, the Fiver's extra low-down from the lowlands brought to you in association with breathe, starts on the morning of June 5.

Had depressing chat with Tecos Guadalajara about midfielder Roberto Palacios. Find out he plays for Peru. Cah! I'm not landing myself with another player like Nobby Solano who's always away on international duty. Flipping South America. Decide to leave for Europe. Today On plane to Paris for tomorrow's Big Cup final. Note that Atletico Madrid striker Kiko is available for \u00a34.5m. Consider talking to representatives tomorrow and making bid. Doze off for a while, dreaming of a \u00a33m offer for Benfica midfielder Calado, and the secret deal for a big-name European striker which people say I'm keeping under my hat. Wake up, tittering. Today (later) Still on plane. A bit bored, so speak to Portuguese FA on new-fangled jet phone. Push them on decision over defender Fernando Meira, who has walked out on Vitoria Guimaraes in a row over wages and may be a free agent. But if the Portuguese FA decide he's still under contract, he'll cost me \u00a32.5m. They can whistle. Today (even later) Been on this plane far too long. Where's Paris? Become agitated when bids for Blackburn pair Damien Duff and Matt Jansen are turned down. Bah! That's it! Decide Fulham can go to hell if they want Didier Domi in exchange for Lee Clark. And as for this irritating Hugh Grant film they're showing... stewardess! * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"You can't buy a player, moreover a forward, and then drop him if he doesn't score in two matches - especially when he cost as much as I did. Oh, the stupidity and the hypocrisy of people who change sides today\" - Nicolas Anelka in L'Equipe. He was dropped by Real. That's all we can say, really. * * * * * * * * * * * * * LET'S HEAR IT FOR GALATASARAY! We all love Galatasaray. Nobody who watched their progress to the Euro-Vase this season can fail to have been won over by the charm of their fans, the straight-talking nature of their officials, and the honesty of their players (even when spinning six feet in the air after a challenge). So who will begrudge this ground-breaking sporting organisation a reward of \u00a317m from the Turkish government? Certainly not the Fiver, but a few Turks might. The Fiver has been deluged - alright, slightly annoyed - by emails today complaining in finest Turklish about the multi-million bonus Gala are set to receive. \"What about the earthquake victims?\" they ask. \"What about establishing a sound economic base upon which to secure entry into the European Union?\" they also ask, rather long-windedly. Finally, and perhaps most pertinently, they wonder: \"Why are Gala getting squillions when members of the Korac Cup-winning Efes Pilsen basketball team got a pen-and-tie combination set?\" If only the Fiver, sounding board for the world's football problems, could provide an answer. Particularly one that wasn't potentially libellous. Sadly, all we can do is observe another stroke of Gala good luck - a joint shirt-sponsorship deal with lowly neighbours Istanbulspor which should net the pair in the region of \u00a316m. Coincidentally, the deal was signed last week, after which Gala surprisingly drew 1-1 with Istanbulspor in the final game of the season - a result which kept the smaller club in the top flight. It's a footballing fairytale! * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Bradford are believed to have made a \u00a32m bid for Manchester United's Jonathan Greening. The 21-year-old has been on the fringes of the Old Trafford side this season, and fits into Bradford manager Paul Jewell's plans to rejuvenate his ageing side. Everton have made Wimbledon captain Kenny Cunningham their top transfer target this summer. The Merseysiders are expected to ask the Dons to name their price for the Republic of Ireland full-back. Dutch international defender Winston Bogarde is expected to leave Barcelona very shortly and his eventual destination is expected to be Chelsea. Similarly Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is said to prefer a move to Chelsea if, as expected, he leaves Atletico Madrid this summer. Both Milan and Lazio have made approaches to sign Luis Figo, according to the manager of the Portuguese national side, Jose Veiga. \"We have received very good offers,\" Veiga said. \"Figo is okay in Barcelona, but they offer much money.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Trevor Sinclair has confirmed that he is staying at West Ham. \"There have been a lot of rumours but it doesn't bother me because as far as I'm concerned I want to stay here at least until the end of my contract,\" he told the Evening Standard. \"The supporters have got nothing to worry about because I'm a Hammers man through and through. Vicente del Bosque has been rewarded for guiding Real Madrid into the final of Big Cup with a one-year contract as permanent manager. John Benson will step down as Wigan manager regardless of the Second Division play-off final result against Gillingham. Danny Wilson is favourite to succeed Benson, who may become the club's general manager. Morton supporters are to petition the Scottish Parliament for support in their efforts to save the club.

Very droll. </p> <p> <strong> Wednesday </strong></p> <p> This morning, Dr Jarvis is good-humoured when I call, but to the point. \"I can't talk, I have a patient waiting,\" she says. \"You know, 'patient'?

Marsha Brady?\" \"You have backache,\" she says, \" but if you are worried, come in and do a sample.\" She sounds translucently bored. \"No, that's quite all right doctor,\" I reply, \"no need for that.\" The thing about giving samples is, you have no idea what they might find. </p> <p> <strong>Thursday </strong></p> <p> This morning, the doctor's heroic patience evaporates further. \"If you are concerned about the kidney,\" she says, extremely slowly, like a traffic cop directing an au pair newly arrived from Helsinki to Carnaby Street, \"come . . . in... and... do... a... urine... sample.\" A silence ensues. \"What really gets to me is the boredom,\" says Dr Jarvis eventually. \"This is the seventh time in a fortnight you've asked about the same thing. It's the repetitiveness. Can't you come up with something new? You haven't presented anything new for years. Literally, years.\" </p> <p>Reflecting on this, I realise the doctor is right. In the nine years since she succeeded the excellent Fleur Navey as my doctor, I must have consulted her 300-400 times, but about so few things - deviated septum, ear infections (otitis media and externa), bronchitis, flu, cancers of the brain, testes, rectum, colon, stomach, blood and latterly kidney, arterial blockages, motor neurone disease, that persistent lump in the roof of my mouth... all the usual suspects, brought in for questioning time and again, and released without charge. I can see why she's bored. </p> <p><strong> Friday </strong><br> Although for once my back is relatively free of pain, I am exhausted. A small boy in our house, we discover today, has a spiral fracture of his left leg from ankle to knee, and he appears to view this as an excuse for the entire family to stay up until 3am watching The Railway Children. Therefore I have had to postpone a trawl through my medical textbooks to find something recherche to revive Dr Jarvis's jaded palate. </p> <p><strong> Saturday</strong> </p> <p> Interrupted in the middle of her emergency clinic, the doctor is to the point. \"What now?\" \"Something new - a strange tingling in the extremities. Touching anything, however soft, puts my teeth on edge. I've never had that before.\" \"Yes you have.\" \"I don't think so.\" \"Hang on...\" Fingers click audibly on computer keyboard... \"May 29 1998, complains of tingling in fingers and teeth being on edge.\" Now I think of it, it does ring a bell. \"And I diagnosed eve of world cup over-excitability. Is there a big football tournament this summer?\" \"Right, goodbye then, doctor. Thank you very much.\" </p> <p> <strong>Sunday</strong></p> <p> Tonight, finally, I spend time with my medical dictionaries, and eventually discover something new that I suffer from. Condylomata acuminata, it's called, and it needs prompt treatment. Poised to ring the doctor when, re-reading the entry more closely, I notice that condylomata acuminata is the technical term for vaginal warts. </p> <p><strong> Monday</strong></p> <p> I awake feeling nervy and unsettled, having passed a troubled night. In a dream, I am in the Hammersmith hospital's radiology department. \"Yes, yes,\" says a young doctor, smugly, \"your brain is fine. Absolutely fine.\" But on leaving the room, I become extremely confused - the result, I realise, of a mango-sized frontal lobe tumour of a type caused by brain cells becoming so bored with themselves that they change character in a quest for light relief. </p> <p>I bump into a woman. \"Excusing me, please, but I coming from Helsinki and know not where to go for to be becoming more and more interesting?\" I say. \"Go... that... way, yes,\" says Dr Jarvis, very slowly, \"around... corner... and... straight... on.\" I follow the direction.

      "body": "<p>Every other Friday, Bradford Royal Infirmary's neonatal unit is host to a clutch of swaddled babies, oblivious to the controversy they are creating. Today there are five suckling babes quietly waiting to go under the surgeon's knife. For the moment only a nervous silence suggests the serenity might be short-lived. </p> <p>How things have changed. In my day there were no waiting rooms, no hospitals, no trained doctors, no anaesthetic, and certainly no aftercare. It's been more than 20 years since my own circumcision at the age of seven but the memory is as painful as if it had been etched in my mind yesterday. </p> <p>My twin and I were taken to a GP's surgery in Blackburn. I think I went first, a conclusion reached some years later when I realised my inability to recall my brother's piercing cries, just my own, as a strange figure donned gloves while my father and his friend held me down. The rest is a blank, the effect, I would later discover, of passing out. I still hadn't come round by the time they'd pinned my brother down. I only regained consciousness at home hours later to discover my vital region bandaged up and sore. </p> <p>I'd like to believe the days of the back-street circumcision are long gone. But horror stories still abound: of the occasional glans being excised, of other mutilations and avoidable infections. Many practitioners remain unqualified and the operation is just as likely to be performed on the dining table as in the operating theatre. </p> <p>Thankfully, change is at hand. In 1996, Bradford NHS trust became the first medical authority to provide a circumcision service. Despite early opposition, a slow uptake and some teething problems, it has now grown to account for a fifth of all neonatal male circumcisions in the city. That however, is only one measure of its success. Perhaps a more telling indi cator is that babies are regularly brought in from as far afield as Newcastle and Hull. Another is that Bradford's model has been adopted by hospitals in Bolton, Bury, Sandwell, and Leicester. </p> <p>Nafisa Hafeji is a Mancunian but has made the journey across the Pennines with Mustafa, her six-week-old son. The 27-year-old is horrified that her city's 35,000 Muslims still largely rely on untrained GPs to perform what can be a tricky procedure. \"I feel much safer about having it performed in a hospital,\" she says, \"you know everything is clean and sterile.\" </p> <p>She eyes the clock as it approaches 12.40. At roughly half-hour intervals from now all the babies will be cradled away into the operating theatre. Mustafa is last in line. Nafisa's husband couldn't get the day off work but her mother is on hand to help. They disappear behind a curtain to be shown a video explaining the operation. </p> <p>Dr Tariq Shah, consultant urologist at BRI and the pioneer of its circumcision service, is doing the explaining. Throughout the day he will be on hand to oversee his nurses perform the operations. Each one has undergone an intensive training programme. Bradford NHS trust makes no bones about its reasons for offering the procedure. Although claims of an overriding health benefit are often made, the medical case for routine male circumcision in the west is at least inconclusive. This service is primarily a religious one. </p> <p>\"Look,\" says Shah, \"there are about 1,000 Muslim male babies born in BRI every year. They all need circumcising. Until now they have been performed privately by GPs but most of them have never had the training. Nor have they been trained to deal with complications. We in the NHS are having to pick up the pieces - and the cost - of these botched operations.\" </p> <p>Critics of the service have accused Bradford of introducing circumcision through the back door. The NHS, they point out, is supposed to dispense treatment based on clinical not religious need. </p> <p>Shah is sensitive to the charge. But for him the matter demands a commonsense approach based on pre-emption and prevention. \"Muslims will demand circumcision for cultural and social reasons no matter what. But the NHS can only provide it if medically required. But that would be leaving room for back-street circumcisions, something that would also cost the NHS since it would have to repair the damage they do. </p> <p>\"That's not to say we don't have any complications. But because all our staff are properly trained they don't tend to be as serious. And if there are any problems we can dealwith them swiftly on site.\" </p> <p>Circumcisions are not free, but parents pay no more than the cost of materials used in the procedure. At \u00a360 the fee compares favourably with private practitioners. The nurses provide their services for no extra pay. </p> <p>Our conversation is interrupted by the sound of a baby crying. Next door, Dr Mohammed Ajmal is part-way through an operation. It's uncomfortable viewing but by no-means x-rated stuff. As one nurse comforts the bawling patient and another tugs down his anaesthesised foreskin, Dr Ajmal, a trainee from Manchester, cleans underneath. He then fits a Plastibell, an upturned protective plastic hood, over the head of the penis. The prepuce is drawn over and a cord tightly tied around the foreskin to fit snugly into a groove on the Plastibell underneath. </p> <p>With the blood supply to the foreskin now cut off, Ajmal makes an inch-long vertical incision in the foreskin and cuts around it in a loop until the skin has been removed. Blood seeps from the cut, but not in the copious quantities I'd imagined. Time for a quick clean, a fresh nappy and the operation is complete. The bell and cord stay in place. Within seven days the part of the prepuce that cannot be cut off will drop off on its own as dead skin. </p> <p>How much pain is involved is hard to quantify but the medical consensus is that it increases with age. Bradford will only accept patients aged between four and 12 weeks. Older patients, I am told, need greater restraint because the nerve fibres in the foreskin are more sensitive. Younger ones are just too small and fidgety. </p> <p>Shah concedes the surgery is not pain free but says it is not as bad as people assume. \"Babies do not feel that much pain, just some tugging and pressure. They cry as much because they are tied down and detached from their mother.\" </p> <p>This is where he is on vulnerable ground.

      "bodyText": "Every other Friday, Bradford Royal Infirmary's neonatal unit is host to a clutch of swaddled babies, oblivious to the controversy they are creating. Today there are five suckling babes quietly waiting to go under the surgeon's knife. For the moment only a nervous silence suggests the serenity might be short-lived. How things have changed. In my day there were no waiting rooms, no hospitals, no trained doctors, no anaesthetic, and certainly no aftercare. It's been more than 20 years since my own circumcision at the age of seven but the memory is as painful as if it had been etched in my mind yesterday. My twin and I were taken to a GP's surgery in Blackburn. I think I went first, a conclusion reached some years later when I realised my inability to recall my brother's piercing cries, just my own, as a strange figure donned gloves while my father and his friend held me down. The rest is a blank, the effect, I would later discover, of passing out. I still hadn't come round by the time they'd pinned my brother down. I only regained consciousness at home hours later to discover my vital region bandaged up and sore. I'd like to believe the days of the back-street circumcision are long gone. But horror stories still abound: of the occasional glans being excised, of other mutilations and avoidable infections. Many practitioners remain unqualified and the operation is just as likely to be performed on the dining table as in the operating theatre. Thankfully, change is at hand. In 1996, Bradford NHS trust became the first medical authority to provide a circumcision service. Despite early opposition, a slow uptake and some teething problems, it has now grown to account for a fifth of all neonatal male circumcisions in the city. That however, is only one measure of its success. Perhaps a more telling indi cator is that babies are regularly brought in from as far afield as Newcastle and Hull. Another is that Bradford's model has been adopted by hospitals in Bolton, Bury, Sandwell, and Leicester. Nafisa Hafeji is a Mancunian but has made the journey across the Pennines with Mustafa, her six-week-old son. The 27-year-old is horrified that her city's 35,000 Muslims still largely rely on untrained GPs to perform what can be a tricky procedure. \"I feel much safer about having it performed in a hospital,\" she says, \"you know everything is clean and sterile.\" She eyes the clock as it approaches 12.40. At roughly half-hour intervals from now all the babies will be cradled away into the operating theatre. Mustafa is last in line. Nafisa's husband couldn't get the day off work but her mother is on hand to help. They disappear behind a curtain to be shown a video explaining the operation. Dr Tariq Shah, consultant urologist at BRI and the pioneer of its circumcision service, is doing the explaining. Throughout the day he will be on hand to oversee his nurses perform the operations. Each one has undergone an intensive training programme. Bradford NHS trust makes no bones about its reasons for offering the procedure. Although claims of an overriding health benefit are often made, the medical case for routine male circumcision in the west is at least inconclusive. This service is primarily a religious one. \"Look,\" says Shah, \"there are about 1,000 Muslim male babies born in BRI every year. They all need circumcising. Until now they have been performed privately by GPs but most of them have never had the training. Nor have they been trained to deal with complications. We in the NHS are having to pick up the pieces - and the cost - of these botched operations.\" Critics of the service have accused Bradford of introducing circumcision through the back door. The NHS, they point out, is supposed to dispense treatment based on clinical not religious need. Shah is sensitive to the charge. But for him the matter demands a commonsense approach based on pre-emption and prevention. \"Muslims will demand circumcision for cultural and social reasons no matter what. But the NHS can only provide it if medically required. But that would be leaving room for back-street circumcisions, something that would also cost the NHS since it would have to repair the damage they do. \"That's not to say we don't have any complications. But because all our staff are properly trained they don't tend to be as serious. And if there are any problems we can dealwith them swiftly on site.\" Circumcisions are not free, but parents pay no more than the cost of materials used in the procedure. At \u00a360 the fee compares favourably with private practitioners. The nurses provide their services for no extra pay. Our conversation is interrupted by the sound of a baby crying. Next door, Dr Mohammed Ajmal is part-way through an operation. It's uncomfortable viewing but by no-means x-rated stuff. As one nurse comforts the bawling patient and another tugs down his anaesthesised foreskin, Dr Ajmal, a trainee from Manchester, cleans underneath. He then fits a Plastibell, an upturned protective plastic hood, over the head of the penis. The prepuce is drawn over and a cord tightly tied around the foreskin to fit snugly into a groove on the Plastibell underneath. With the blood supply to the foreskin now cut off, Ajmal makes an inch-long vertical incision in the foreskin and cuts around it in a loop until the skin has been removed. Blood seeps from the cut, but not in the copious quantities I'd imagined. Time for a quick clean, a fresh nappy and the operation is complete. The bell and cord stay in place. Within seven days the part of the prepuce that cannot be cut off will drop off on its own as dead skin. How much pain is involved is hard to quantify but the medical consensus is that it increases with age. Bradford will only accept patients aged between four and 12 weeks. Older patients, I am told, need greater restraint because the nerve fibres in the foreskin are more sensitive. Younger ones are just too small and fidgety. Shah concedes the surgery is not pain free but says it is not as bad as people assume. \"Babies do not feel that much pain, just some tugging and pressure. They cry as much because they are tied down and detached from their mother.\" This is where he is on vulnerable ground. While circumcision does have demonstrable health benefits, the clinical case is far from proven. Opponents see the suffering as unjustified. They call circumcision a \"euphemism for genital reduction surgery or genital mutilation performed on children who, by definition are not able to give informed consent\". Led by a group called Norm UK, the anti-circumcision lobby says the operation, performed on 20,000-30,000 British infants each year, also causes lasting trauma and feelings of shame and violation. For Muslims and Jews, the centuries-old rite has traditionally served as a symbol of group identity and a means of ensuring personal hygiene.

Her nerves are on edge. \"I'm glad I don't have to go in,\" she says with a sideways glance at her mother. \"I told her she's going to have to change his nappy for the next week.

      "body": "<p>As the car trundles slowly towards the summit, the thoughts of the foolhardy thrillseeker ascending the Oblivion rollercoaster at Alton Towers in Staffordshire tend to dwell on the more fundamental questions of life: its transience, its fragility - and how, under the wrong circumstances, a vertical drop at high speed from a very great height can bring it rather swiftly to an end. Once the car has reached the precipice, though, there's no time to think: screaming participants are plunged face-first into a black hole at 70mph, their bodies withstanding forces reaching four-and-a-half times that of gravity. It takes several moments, at the end, before paralysing terror is replaced with a surge of relief, exhilaration and an overpowering smugness towards those who opted to wait on the ground instead. </p> <p>In recent months, though, a hand ful of riders on some of the world's most stomach-churning rollercoasters in the US and Japan have been reporting some more disturbing sensations: persistent headaches, symptoms of blood clots in the brain which, if left untreated, can cause brain damage, seizures, and even death. This month, America's consumer product safety commission put at 16 the number of reported cases of brain damage believed to be related to the extreme g-forces experienced on white-knuckle rides. In one of the most serious incidents, Japanese researchers reported that a 24- year-old woman had been diagnosed as suffering from subdural haematomas - ruptured veins on the brain's surface, better known as a key symptom of shaken baby syndrome - after taking a 70m plunge on the giant Fujiyama rollercoaster. </p> <p>The thought that one's safety might be in immediate and serious danger is, of course, as crucial to the thrill of a good rollercoaster ride as is the underlying faith that death won't actually result from the experience. And, by and large, the industry has an excellent safety record: 500m rides are purchased in Britain each year, but the nightmare mechanical failures - the loose screw, the insecure harness, the heart-stopping mid-loop halt - are so rare as to prompt just 400 accident reports to the health and safety executive in total. Theme parks enjoy reminding critics that the chances of having an accident while driving to an attraction are seven times greater than when riding on it; equivalent US figures show that fishing is 17 times more dangerous. </p> <p>But the new generation of giant rollercoasters are raising a different kind of safety fear, as parks race to outdo each other in speed, altitude and nerve-shattering terror. This is not a field in which records remain standing for very long, but the current leaders - according to the Rollercoaster Club of Great Britain - give a sense of the territory: Millennium Force at Cedar Point, Ohio, is the tallest conventional rollercoaster at 95m; and Superman - The Escape, at the Magic Mountain park in California, the fastest, firing riders down its 377m of track at 100mph, exposing them to forces approaching those previously only experienced by astronauts and jet-fighter pilots. </p> <p>\"We suspect that many cases have been overlooked,\" warned Toshio Fukutake, a neurologist at Chiba University in Japan, who wrote the Fujiyama study. He acknowledged that the problem was rare, but added: \"Giant rollercoasters that are higher and faster than typical roller coasters may be more dangerous_ the woman's subdural haematomas and resulting headaches may have been caused by the up-and down, back-and-forth motions of the rollercoaster, or the acceleration force may have been strong enough to rupture veins on the surface of her brain.\" </p> <p>Haematomas - usually encountered in older men suffering from alcoholism, hypertension or diabetes - are extremely rare in younger women, but eminently treatable: eight weeks after presenting her symptoms, the woman made a full recovery. But her case adds weight to earlier studies of \"rollercoaster headache\", including a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1995 in which the effects were likened to whiplash injuries.\"The swooping ride induces marked rotatory and other positional changes in a deformable brain that is moving within a relatively rigid skull, thus causing tensile and shearing stresses,\" the authors observed. </p> <p>The forces experienced while hurtling down hundreds of metres of steel tracks demand years of professional training in other contexts: astronauts reach a g-force of 3 during the launch of the Space Shuttle; Blackpool Pleasure Beach's \u00a312m Pepsi Max Big One - so tall it requires aircraft warning beacons from the Civil Aviation Authority - subjects riders to 3.5g; Alton Towers' Oblivion reaches 4.5. Only jet-fighter pilots experience a greater hammering - and they wear anti-gravity suits to pump air around their lower bodies, compressing blood vessels to prevent the rapid drain of blood from the head as g-forces spiral towards 9 and 10. </p> <p>The British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions is adamant that no British rides have ever been linked to these risks. \"We are aware that there are a number of rides in this country that exert moderate g-forces, and there is no evidence that this is known to affect people's health, providing that passengers follow the operators' safety warnings and advice,\" says a spokesman for the group. </p> <p>In any case, much as theme parks crow about them - \"Some TV Gladiators were actually sick after sampling the world's ultimate white-knuckle ride,\" says Alton Towers of its 4g Nemesis attraction - high forces are not all they seem. \"You can't compare absolute figures,\" says Volker Damman, head of medical operations at the European Space Agency and an expert on the effects of space travel on the human body. \"It depends on how long you're exposed to high forces for. On a rollercoaster you're talking about milliseconds and you can experience that turning a sharp bend in a car. </p> <p>\"It also matters how your body is positioned: the worst is vertical force, pushing blood away from the head. Russian astronauts on the Soyuz withstood 5g for much longer, but they were lying on their backs. It was much, much harder for them to breathe, but the blood was drawn from their chest to their back, which is less of a problem.\" </p> <p>Ultimately, all this may be of some concern to those who spend endless hours on some of the world's biggest rollercoasters: men and women of impenetrable motives such as Richard Rodriguez, the American who seized the world record for the world's single longest rollercoaster ride by spending 1,013 hours onboard in 1998. For the rest of us, sheer, jelly-legged terror may prove a surprisingly effective form of preventative medicine.</p>",

Checking this normally requires more tests. As with all screening, scans are not foolproof. Studies show that scans detect up to 80% of severe abnormalities but on rare occasions foetuses are aborted that are healthy or have insignificant problems. Safety There is no evidence scans cause harm to the baby but more research is needed to prove this beyond doubt. Choice Some midwives are concerned that scans are presented as routine rather than an option and that counselling, pointing out that abnormalities may be found, is rarely given. Information A leaflet, Ultrasound scans - should you have one?, published by the Midwives Information and Resource Service, is available from some midwives. \u0095 What works? is based on reviews of the most up-to-date and reliable evidence available. It is written in collaboration with the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at York university (01904 433 634) and verified by experts.",

Some critics and delegates thought it an almost insupportably harrowing study of a young woman and the indomitable spirit with which she copes with life's injustice, this spirit deepened and made gloriously vivid by her fantasy musical life. Others thought Bj\u00f6rk's childlike performance trod a fine line between touching serenity and naff, unintentional absurdity, but that this riskiness and edginess were all part of the flash and crash of Von Trier's experimentalism. </p> <p>I belonged to the third contingent, which thought it was rubbish. For all the style and brio, there was something crudely manipulative about the story, and something facetious and shallow about the whole enterprise. Just as in The Idiots, where the suspicion persisted that the subject of the sexual existence and identity of those suffering from mental handicap was simply a joke, Dancer in the Dark looked like a sprightly Dogme movie with MTV videos dropped in for the song and dance numbers. Von Trier clearly had no serious love of musicals; they were just a gimmick. </p> <p>Von Trier's movie-making is an event, a happening. With its audacity and provocation, Dancer in the Dark demanded a response, and it got one. Amid the stately parade of high art cinema, it made a splash. But that was all it made. The final anguish of Bj\u00f6rk's death is just ridiculous - and self-important. Nothing in the film is deeply felt, or deeply considered, and the euphoria soon wears off, leaving only the conviction that this is a middlebrow film, for people with posters of Bj\u00f6rk on their bedroom wall. </p> <p>But there you are. Cannes is definitely under threat from those who feel it isn't where the action is: the Hollywood and Anglophone movie-makers stay away, leaving the festival with uncommercial art movies, some of questionable quality, and whose failings are apparent when exposed to the glare of the festival audience. Von Trier is news; he makes people sit up; his film is in English and it has got a pop star in it. Maybe that is what the Cannes festival thinks it needs. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the much vaunted far eastern content of the festival received consolation prizes. Edward Yang got the director's prize for <strong>Yi Yi</strong>, a beautifully crafted, engaging film about an unhappy family in Taiwan. Guizi Lai Le, or <strong>Devils on the Doorstep</strong>, Jiang Wen's film about the wartime Japanese occupation of China, got the Grand Prize, and the critics' prize went to Shinji Aoyama's epic <strong>Eureka</strong>. The best actor award went to Tony Leung for his excellent performance as the unhappy, cuckolded husband in Wong Kar-Wei's <strong>In the Mood for Love</strong>, set in 1962 Hong Kong. Leung is a marvellous performer and this elegant, sad film deserves UK distribution. </p> <p>The really good news from Cannes is that a bauble went to one of the best films of the festival: <strong>Songs from the Second Floor</strong>, by Roy Andersson, which delivered the mega-voltage jolt that Dancer in the Dark promised but failed to provide, won the Jury Prize. A deeply disturbing and yet unaccountably hilarious film, it was presented in a series of surreal, painterly tableaux that play fast and loose with the perspectives and contours of reality. </p> <p>Andersson's film is set at the end of the millennium, with life in a northern European city on the verge of breakdown. A traffic jam has paralysed the city and a torpid miasma of despair and anxiety convulses society, to the extent that only a human sacrifice will exorcise these fin-de-si\u00e8cle demons. Alongside this ghastly sense of the end of the world, there are minor, farcical disasters: a magician's act going wrong, an insurance-arson job covering the perpetrator in giveaway soot. </p> <p>Andersson's anti-narrative is vividly and agonisingly realised: it has something of Ingmar Bergman, Terry Gilliam and Woody Allen, but is very distinctive. In Songs from the Second Floor, he has created a secret cabaret of existential anxiety, and his movie was one of the joys of Cannes. </p> <p>Once again, the on dit is that Cannes is finished and other festivals, like Toronto, are more important: a theory often airily put about by people who wouldn't dream of actually going to Toronto. Cannes has certainly got a problem attracting US movies: the big fish don't see the advantage in entering their expensive babies for competition. But where Cannes can and must score is getting the indie breakthroughs, such as the Palme d'Or winners of yesteryear: sex, lies and videotape or Pulp Fiction. Increasingly, movies like these are getting their festival plaudits at Sundance or Telluride. </p> <p>One of the shrewdest things about Cannes has often been its mixture of big stars and highbrow academics on the juries. As Philip French wrote in the Observer, this has the happy effect of making the stars feel like intellectuals and the intellectuals feel like stars. And it makes everyone feel that world cinema is a coherent, intelligible concept that can be judged by a jury of open-minded professionals. Cannes used to have that broad mix in its films: now it is losing it. This year, it needed more lively US films, but also lighter films, more comedies, love stories and populist dramas. Even the Asian films, some of them excellent, are mostly destined for the festival circuit; and a European festival audience may have difficulty distinguishing a great Chinese film from something posterity may dismiss as a Far East Merchant Ivory. Tellingly, Ang Lee's thrilling martial arts/action movie, <strong>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</strong>, was shown out of competition. </p> <p>In the end, the Cannes festival will have to promote the aspect of the movies which is difficult to acknowledge: their sexiness - which has nothing to do with sex or box office appeal, but currency and contemporary charge; it is the sense of what gets movies talked about. This is probably what appealed with Dancer in the Dark, and to some extent Von Trier's award is valuable, as his film will indeed be talked about. But it is unfortunate that the big prizewinner is this negligible and faintly embarrassing film, when pictures like Yang's Yi Yi, Andersson's Songs from the Second Floor and James Gray's The Yards will surely outlast it.</p>",

Tellingly, Ang Lee's thrilling martial arts/action movie, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, was shown out of competition. In the end, the Cannes festival will have to promote the aspect of the movies which is difficult to acknowledge: their sexiness - which has nothing to do with sex or box office appeal, but currency and contemporary charge; it is the sense of what gets movies talked about. This is probably what appealed with Dancer in the Dark, and to some extent Von Trier's award is valuable, as his film will indeed be talked about. But it is unfortunate that the big prizewinner is this negligible and faintly embarrassing film, when pictures like Yang's Yi Yi, Andersson's Songs from the Second Floor and James Gray's The Yards will surely outlast it.",

Recent attempts to prosecute large companies for manslaughter by gross negligence have failed because it proved impossible to identify named individuals and prove them personally guilty of manslaughter. In the Southall train crash case, the crown prosecution service failed to persuade the courts that the commonlaw offence of manslaughter could be applied to corporations, in this case Great Western Trains. After the Paddington crash, in which 31 people died, the CPS announced it would take no further action. </p> <p><b>Have there been successful prosecutions under the present law?</b><br> There have been only two successful prosecutions in Britain for corporate manslaughter.

Competitors are advised to retain a record of their answers and to check them against the answers we have recorded. An entry will be changed in the event of an error on our part.

No phone or fax enquiries can be handled.</p> <p> <strong>6. Entries must be on the official form. Photocopies are acceptable, provided the answers are clearly legible. Further entry forms are also obtainable by sending an SAE to the above address - but please remember only one entry is allowed per person. All invalid or incomplete entries will be discarded without notification.</strong></p> <p><strong> 7.</strong> There is no cash alternative to the prizes. Prizes will be as stated, and if winners are unable to take up the prize no alternative will be offered. In order to be eligible for a prize, entrants aged under 16 must have their entry form signed by a parent or guardian. In the event of a tie for the overall prize, those involved will be notified and Wisden will set a tiebreak question or questions until a winner emerges. In the event of a tie for the monthly prizes, the entrant with the highest overall standing will be the winner.

The questions remain valid if the same match is played at another time or place before the end of the 2000 season.</strong></p> <p><strong> 9.</strong> Where alternative answers are suggested, entrants must choose one of these options. Other answers (e.g. a no-result in a one-day match) will be marked as wrong. If a match does not take place, or if a one-day match where a result is requested does not finish, the question will be treated as void. In questions involving individuals, anyone not taking part in the match will be treated as a wrong answer.</p> <p> <strong>10. If two answers are equally correct, dead-heat rules apply, e.g. if a match is tied, those predicting a draw will be marked wrong and those predicting a win for either side will get half the available points. Ties in other questions will be treated similarly. However, decimal places will be excluded and rounded down to the nearest whole number (e.g. if there is a tie between three of the players in question 15, all those who predicted any one of the three will receive three points).</strong></p> <p><strong> 11.</strong> Competitors are responsible for ensuring that their entries are clear and unambiguous. Answers which cannot be read clearly will be treated as wrong.</p> <p> 12. The decision of the editor-in-chief of John Wisden &amp; Co. Ltd is final in all cases.

Each entry from overseas must include five international reply coupons. Families and friends may send entries in the same envelope, but each entry must be accompanied by the \u00a32.50 entry fee. Forms received without the entry fee will be discarded. 4. All entries must be received by close of business on Friday, May 12, 2000. Entries once received cannot be altered. Proof of posting does not constitute proof of delivery. However, competitors will receive through the post a copy of their entry, as recorded on our computer, and a unique PIN number. Competitors are advised to retain a record of their answers and to check them against the answers we have recorded. An entry will be changed in the event of an error on our part. Otherwise, the original answer as written on the entry form must stand. If there is an error or if you have not received your copy, write to the address below. Your letter MUST be received by close of business on June 30, 2000, or it will not be considered under any circumstances. 5. All entries and appeals must be posted to Reality Cricket, Octagon House, White Hart Meadows, Ripley, Surrey GU23 6HR. No phone or fax enquiries can be handled. 6.

Further entry forms are also obtainable by sending an SAE to the above address - but please remember only one entry is allowed per person. All invalid or incomplete entries will be discarded without notification. 7. There is no cash alternative to the prizes. Prizes will be as stated, and if winners are unable to take up the prize no alternative will be offered. In order to be eligible for a prize, entrants aged under 16 must have their entry form signed by a parent or guardian. In the event of a tie for the overall prize, those involved will be notified and Wisden will set a tiebreak question or questions until a winner emerges. In the event of a tie for the monthly prizes, the entrant with the highest overall standing will be the winner. If there is still a tie, the entrant closest to the answer to Question 6, 12, 23, or 36 (whichever is relevant) will be the winner. 8. Dates and venues are given for guidance only. The questions remain valid if the same match is played at another time or place before the end of the 2000 season. 9. Where alternative answers are suggested, entrants must choose one of these options. Other answers (e.g. a no-result in a one-day match) will be marked as wrong. If a match does not take place, or if a one-day match where a result is requested does not finish, the question will be treated as void. In questions involving individuals, anyone not taking part in the match will be treated as a wrong answer. 10. If two answers are equally correct, dead-heat rules apply, e.g. if a match is tied, those predicting a draw will be marked wrong and those predicting a win for either side will get half the available points. Ties in other questions will be treated similarly. However, decimal places will be excluded and rounded down to the nearest whole number (e.g. if there is a tie between three of the players in question 15, all those who predicted any one of the three will receive three points). 11. Competitors are responsible for ensuring that their entries are clear and unambiguous. Answers which cannot be read clearly will be treated as wrong. 12. The decision of the editor-in-chief of John Wisden &amp; Co. Ltd is final in all cases. Rulings to cover unforeseen eventualities will be made by Wisden if necessary. Return to Phase One",

      "body": "<p>Everyone acknowledges John Gielgud was a great actor. But his contribution to modern British theatre has been seriously underrated. As a producer, he was a radical visionary who, long before the era of subsidy, saw the need for semi-permanent classical companies. </p> <p>And as an actor, although his reputation was for vocal splendour and stylish conservatism, he allied himself with adventurous directors such as Peter Brook and Alain Resnais and with living writers such as Harold Pinter, Edward Bond, Alan Bennett and David Storey. Even though he once turned down Endgame, it seems fitting that his final job, completed only a month ago, was a film of Beckett's Catastrophe directed by David Mamet. </p> <p>But Gielgud's greatest legacy was his now largely forgotten work as an actor-manager in the 1930s and 1940s. At a time when West End theatre was relentlessly frivolous and ephemeral, Gielgud had the vision and foresight to create classical companies. At the New Theatre in 1935, where he and Olivier famously alternated as Romeo and Mercutio, at the Queen's Theatre in 1937-8 and at the Haymarket in 1944, he laid the foundations for post-war British theatre. </p> <p>Gielgud presented a classical repertory comprising Shakespeare, Congreve, Sheridan and Chekhov. He engaged the design team of Motley to give the productions visual coherence. And he surrounded himself with the rising generation of actors, including Peggy Ashcroft, Alec Guinness, George Devine, Anthony Quayle, and Glen Byam Shaw. Significantly, Devine went on to found the English Stage Company in 1956 and Quayle and Byam Shaw to revolutionise standards at Stratford in the 1950s. </p> <p>But it was Gielgud who erected a signpost to the future: one that led to the founding of the RSC and the National Theatre. As \"Percy\" Harris, part of the Motley design team who herself died only a week ago, once told me: \"I think he single-handedly put English theatre back on the map. Larry [Olivier] gets all the credit and John doesn't, which I think is a sign of John's innate modesty.\" </p> <p>Gielgud and Olivier were, of course, legendary opposites both as actors and as men. As Kenneth Tynan once wrote: \"Between good and great acting is fixed an inexorable gulf which may be crossed only by the elect whose visas are in order. Gielgud, seizing a parasol, crosses by tightrope; Olivier polevaults over, hair-raisingly, in a single animal leap.\" That accurately captures Gielgud's lightness and grace as opposed to Olivier's muscular athleticism. But although the two men were temperamental and stylistic opposites there was, on Gielgud's side at least, no personal animosity. </p> <p>It was he who gave Olivier his big classical break as Romeo and Mercutio in 1935. And it was Gielgud who donated the sword once used by Kean as Richard III to Olivier to mark the latter's conquest of the role. But although Gielgud was always seen as the high priest of British acting and Olivier as the heretical pathfinder, I believe that does Gielgud a grave disservice. His willingness to take hair-raising risks was astonishing. </p> <p>Peter Brook, who worked closely with Gielgud at Stratford in the 1950s, talks of his \"unique and endlessly inventive mind, always open to change\". Gielgud's Stratford Lear was also the tortured centre of a radically experimental production with Oriental designs by the Japanese-American sculptor, Isamu Noguchi. And even though Gielgud initially remained aloof from the new movement in British drama, he soon joined what he could not beat. He was unforgettable at the Royal Court as a lachrymose asylum inmate in David Storey's Home, as a self-parodying theatrical knight in Charles Wood's Veterans, and as a despairing, isolated Shakespeare in Edward Bond's Bingo. </p> <p>But it was his famous performance as the demob-suited, sandal-shoed Spooner in Pinter's No Man's Land at the National that crowned his work in modern drama. </p> <p>If, as David Hare always claims, acting is a judgment of character, Gielgud's career tells us a lot about the man: the quicksilver mind, the questing intelligence, the endless curiosity. And all those qualities were confirmed by his remarkable work in his later years in film and television: his raging, dying writer in Resnais's Providence, his acidulous patriarch in Brideshead Revisited, his supercilious valet in Arthur. </p> <p>But my abiding impression of Gielgud was of his irrepressible youthfulness. He would talk, if pressed, about the past. But his racing mind was more interested in the present and future: he never ceased dreaming of making a movie of The Tempest, directed by Ingmar Bergman, though in the end he had to settle for Peter Greenaway's Prospero's Books. </p> <p>Gielgud was often seen as the aristocratic figurehead of British acting embodying traditional values: in my view his greatness, as both actor and manager, lay in his radically restless temperament, his visionary belief in companies, and his astonishing ability to recreate himself from one generation to the next. </p> <p><strong>Pinnacles of his art</strong></p> <p><strong> King Lear (Stratford-on-Avon 1955) </strong> Gielgud once claimed that Isamu Noguchi's experimental Japanese costumes killed the cast's efforts to act in them.

After an emergency meeting of his security cabinet last night, Mr Barak decided to speed up the withdrawal - bringing it forward more than a month ahead of Israel's self-imposed deadline - as Hizbullah guerrillas moved into villages abandoned by the South Lebanese Army, As they evacuated the south Lebanon territories occupied by Israel since 1978, homeward-bound Israeli soldiers honked the horns of jeeps, waved brigade banners and kissed Israeli soil after crossing the frontier. Hundreds of Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen and their families, fleeing from the advancing Hizbullah, were given refuge in a tent camp on the Sea of Galilee. Refugees carrying small bags clambered off Israeli buses and were taken to the large white tents which had housed pilgrims accompanying Pope John Paul II earlier this spring. Israel stepped up its withdrawal, originally scheduled for completion by July 7, after the abrupt disintegration of the South Lebanon Army. Hizbullah took over villages and positions abandoned by the SLA, seizing control of about a quarter of the buffer zone Israel set up in 1985, after a three-year occupation of larger parts of Lebanon. In chaotic fighting yesterday, several Lebanese civilians were killed and Israelis living in border towns were ordered to go into underground bomb shelters. In today's fighting, a driver working with a BBC crew covering the Israeli withdrawal was hit by artillery fire and is believed to have been killed. A cameraman with BBC correspondent Jeremy Bowen said the driver, Abed Takoush, had been caught in the car which was engulfed in flames. Many border residents and political commentators strongly criticised the government, saying it had mishandled the withdrawal and had not foreseen the collapse of the SLA. \"Humiliation permeates the air,\" wrote commentator Hemi Shalev in the Maariv daily newspaper. \"Our allies are toppling and begging for help.

Mr Barak gave extensive radio interviews today to reassure a confused public. \"When we solve the problem from its roots - the withdrawal of the army from Lebanon will take a few days, maybe a week or maybe 10 days - we should not be alarmed,\" he said, confirming for the first time that the withdrawal would be moved up considerably. Israel was in the decisive stage, and needed its civilians to remain steadfast, he said, adding that \"the ongoing tragedy\" of Israel's military presence in Lebanon had reached its end and the buffer zone no longer has a purpose. But the leader of Hizbullah guerrillas said his men would continue their war against Israel if it kept troops in the disputed Shebaa Farms area and refused to release all Lebanese prisoners. \"If the Israelis stay in Shebaa Farms and keeps any Lebanese prisoner...we at Hizbullah will deal with the withdrawal as if it did not happen, and we have to fight to liberate (our country),\" Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah said. Israel has indicated it will not withdraw from the farms, at the foot of the Golan Heights, saying the land is Syrian and not Lebanese. Syria, which has its own dispute with Israel over the Golan Heights, gloated over Israel's reversal.

The tone of malice and exultation from the Inland Revenue didn't go down too well either. It seems that people who work are to be taxed heavily while people who just sell other people's work just pay 10% on their profit. </p> <p> <b>LE: </b> As you say, the rich can always find ways to get round paying tax. It's called tax avoidance, whereas when it's the poor earning a few pounds in the cash economy it's called evasion. </p> <p> <b>sgcc2</b> I'm sorry: I don't get why IR35 will triple people's tax burden... How has it changed? &lt;.p&gt; </p> <p> <b>LE: </b> I'm not an expert on IR35, but as I understand it, self-employed people will be saddled with national insurance payments from April, which will increase the amount of money they hand over to the taxman. </p> <br> <p> <b>fred5:</b> I find it incredible that we have to start paying tax at such low earnings levels in this country. If dear Gordon really wanted to improve the lot of working people, then why not raise the general tax threshold to something like \u00a310,000 before tax is deducted. This would enable more people to live with a reasonable standard of living without having to rely on the state for benefits to top up the short fall. We are a very wealthy nation, but it seems to me that more and more of our earnings are being taxed either directly or by stealth. </p> <p> <b>LE: </b> All tax experts say the best way of helping poor people is to take them out of the tax system altogether by raising tax thresholds. That is a more progressive measure than cutting tax rates, which gives disproportionate help to those earning most. Unfortunately, governments of both left and right are now fixated by tax rates. So I agree, raising thresholds would be an excellent idea. </p> <br> <p> <b>Mpotter:</b> How crucial is the strength of the pound to the good health of the British economy, and how worrying is it that measures to counter it seem to have been left out of the Budget altogether? </p> <p> <b>LE: </b> Overall, the economy is doing pretty well. The strong pound is good for inflation, because it means the cost of imports into Britain are kept low. But for those parts of the economy that rely on exports - mainly but not exclusively manufacturing - the strong pound is proving to be a real headache. Some companies are operating on quite thin margins, so the 30% increase in the value of the pound makes life very difficult for them. </p> <p> Brown doesn't believe there is much that he can do about the state of the pound, believing that it is really caused by the unexpected weakness of the euro. He is hoping that the euro will strengthen. Keeping fiscal policy relatively tight should help by taking pressure off the Bank of England to raise rates, but in the end what would really help would be lower interest rates.

      "bodyText": "More than 2.5 million working parents excluded from the government's new parental leave scheme face a long wait to learn the outcome of a legal challenge launched on their behalf by the TUC. The high court today referred the case to the European Court of Justice for a ruling on the meaning of part of the European parental leave directive and agreement on which the scheme is based, which could take up to two years. The high court refused the TUC's plea for an order that, in the meantime, the excluded parents could take leave, even though they might eventually lose the case. But Lord Bingham, the lord chief justice, and Mr Justice Morison urged the European court to deal with the case as a matter of urgency. They said that if, \"as we think\", trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers may have acted unlawfully in the way he introduced the scheme, \"the sooner this is made clear the better\". The TUC's argument that the government broke European law by excluding 2.7 million employees from the right to take unpaid parental leave was presented last week by Cherie Booth QC in her last court appearance before the birth of her son, Leo. Under the parental leave regulations, introduced on December 15 last year, parents of children born or adopted on or after that date are entitled to 13 weeks' leave spread over the years up to a child's fifth birthday. The prime minister's wife, seeking judicial review in a case against Mr Byers, contended that the cut-off date wrongly shut out parents of children under five born before December 15. Today the TUC was given leave to appeal against the judges' refusal to grant an interim order allowing the parents to take leave while Europe decides. The court heard that if the European court took two years to make a ruling, around one million of the parents would have lost their leave entitlement forever because their children would by then be more than five. TUC general secretary John Monks claimed a \"clear moral victory\" after today's judgement. \"Ministers should now extend parental leave to the nearly 3 million working parents who have missed out, without the need for a lengthy European court case,\" he said. \"Fighting what looks like a doomed case in the European court simply to delay parental leave for those parents with children born before the December deadline sends all the wrong signals from a government that says it wants a better work/life balance,\" he said. \"It is sad to see the UK government take such a family-unfriendly position.\" A spokesman for the Department of Trade and Industry said: \"It is right that this question should be resolved in European courts.

Planet Football claims that another Dutchman, Winston Bogarde, \"seems certain to agree a switch to Stamford Bridge\" despite interest from Middlesbrough. Teamtalk reckons that Bryan Robson is instead targeting Lens strikers Joseph Desire-Job and Pascal Nourma. Cameroonian international Desire-Job scored nine goals in the French First Division last season, while his striking partner Nourma managed fourteen. Meanwhile, their north-eastern rivals Newcastle are also after a striker, Atletico Madrid star Kiko. The Mail reports that the 28-year-old Spanish international is mulling over the details of \u00a34.5m deal which would pay him \u00a325,000 a week.

The Bantams are also said to be interested in Liverpool defender Steve Staunton. Liverpool are close to signing Dynamo Kiev midfielder Kakha Kaladze in an \u00a38m deal, according to the Mail, which also reports that Gary McAllister is on the verge of moving to Anfield after being promised a further 12 months if he helps Liverpool reach the Champions League. Pegguy Arphexad has agreed a three-year contract to become Liverpool's number two goalkeeper behind Sander Westerveld, claims the Express, who also say that Charlton are eyeing Bolton striker Dean Holdsworth. Sheffield Wednesday have given Joe Kinnear until midday today to decide whether he wants to be their new manager, reports the Star.

      "body": "<p>'Take off your clothes.' For the first wave of executive women in Hollywood, that line was often the opening shot in a humiliating job interview. Nor did the situation improve once a position at a studio was secured. There were bosses who began each day with a call announcing: \"I am holding my big veiny dick in my hand\", who told tales of their sexual conquests, who asked their assistants to track down the numbers of cute girls they spotted on Wilshire Boulevard. </p> <p>\"Discussing sexism, indeed sexual harassment, in Hollywood was a little like discussing the fact that the sea was blue,\" says writer Rachel Abramowitz of those first years for women in a town run by men who saw them as objects, arm candy, anything but peers. \"It was accepted as the cost of doing business.\" </p> <p>Yet until now, 25 years after the first wave of women began trying to climb the corporate ladder in Tinsel Town, that cost has been quietly bemoaned, paid, but never examined. Putting Hollywood's power women under the microscope seemed too painful to contemplate. The sexism, the old boys' network, the insults endured. This is the town, remember, where Jodie Foster was initially vetoed for The Accused because she \"wasn't rapeable enough\". </p> <p>There have, of course, always been women in Hollywood: secretaries, story editors, costume designers, actresses. But as power players behind the scenes, they were nonexistent. Back-room Hollywood was like a treehouse with a sign nailed to the door: No Girls Allowed. But as Abramowitz points out in her piercing new book, Is That a Gun in Your Pocket? Women's Experience of Power in Hollywood, in the mid 70s a select few women began jockeying for a place at the corporate table. \"And for every woman who made it came a pejorative story. It was always the same: they slept their way to the top.\" </p> <p>Abramowitz's book, which took seven years to write and is published in the US this month, is all the buzz in Hollywood right now. Encompassing 150 interviews with women at every level, including actress turned producer and now Paramount chief Sherry Lansing, Meryl Streep and director Penny Marshall, it is the first dissection of women, power and their push for leverage in the entertainment industry. \"I was surprised how much it took to stay in the game and that women took it all,\" Abramowitz says. \"They just hung in there, even though they were telling me stories that made your eyes roll back in your head. I think they survived because they chose to wear blinkers.\" </p> <p>But while the rise of the feminist movement coincided with the breakdown of the studio system, few women initially beat a path to Hollywood. Part of the reason was the primacy of the male auteur in the 70s, leaving women to guess, correctly, that Hollywood wasn't interested in their contribution; part was that women still felt uncomfortable with the idea of becoming powerbrokers. \"Seizing power in Hollywood, it's like gladiators,\" Abramowitz says. \"You have to grab it and wrestle people down - it's not enough to do a job well. Women, socialised to be team players, didn't feel comfortable acting like that.\" </p> <p>The few who did come, alone or as wives of successful male directors, moved up from lower-level producing jobs through a combination of tenacity, strategic alliances with powerful men and the adoption of a new personality. \"They were the ball-buster or the geisha,\" Abramowitz says. Dawn Steel, marketing whiz turned production head of Columbia Pictures (who died in 1997), was an abrasive, tough-talking broad whose apeing of male behaviour won the \"boys\" over. Sherry Lansing, known for her diplomacy and sweetness (though she is said to be hard as nails underneath), played the \"girlie girl\", the people pleaser. </p> <p>\"Women had to do two things. They had to adopt one of those two personas to negotiate the inner circle and they had to produce hits. Hits put them on the map.\" (For Lansing it was Fatal Attraction, for Steel, Top Gun.) But when these women began to make strides, it was always accompanied by a push to dismiss them. When California magazine put Steel on the cover as one of the worst bosses in Los Angeles (her screaming was legend), she was chosen over a man who killed two of his migrant workers, then tried to flush them down the toilet. Steel was furious and demanded an explanation. What she discovered was an editor who thought a woman would play on anti-women fears and sell better. He was right. </p> <p> But while Lansing and Steel were climbing the ranks, many women were not so lucky. \"You had the supreme dominance of male adolescent audiences at that time,\" Abramowitz points out. \"The studios could always justify not promoting a woman by saying, oh, she can't make a Porky's or produce a testosterone-charged action movie. There was always an excuse.\" </p> <p>For actresses, the situation was not much better. They were relegated to girlfriend/bimbo/mother roles unless they purchased and produced properties themselves. Meryl Streep summed it up perfectly when talking about the dearth of intelligent roles for women: \"One would assume the chief occupation of women on earth was hooking, and I don't mean rugs.\" </p> <p>The pioneer women who populate Abramowitz's book are in turns angry at the sexist behaviour they endured and mournful at the price they paid. Having to work twice as hard to prove themselves, many didn't have children or successful marriages. But in the 90s, Abramowitz says, things started to turn. With Lansing and Steel running studios, the next generation now had role models: \"Women coming in their wake are less angry and more confident.\" </p> <p>Movies like Thelma &amp; Louise and When Harry Met Sally, both championed by women executives, opened the door further as they proved to the male hierarchy that female executives have a nose for money. \"But they still have a way to go. There are still no female studio owners and no dominant female directors. As soon as women achieve a certain level, the ceiling gets raised again.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>It wasn't meant to be like this. When New Labour swept to power 18 months ahead of the scheduled launch of the EU's single currency, it assumed that the euro would quickly become strong and successful and that the British public would gradually be won over.</p> <p>Instead, voter opposition to the UK joining monetary union has hardened as the euro has become the weakling of the foreign exchanges. The government, which declared three years ago that there were no constitutional barriers to joining the single currency, only economic issues to consider, now finds itself in a tight spot.</p> <p>The government's problem is straightforward. Unlike some countries that have already joined monetary union, Britain will hold a referendum first, and public opposition is running against the single currency by around 3 to 1. Meanwhile, the rest of Europe is losing patience with Britain's wait-and-see approach, with stories emerging from Paris and Berlin of how countries committed to closer ties should be allowed to go it alone.</p> <p>To supporters of UK membership of the euro, this is a familiar story, with Britain losing not just influence but the right to shape European institutions. Some cabinet members - together with leading Conservative euro supporters such as Kenneth Clarke and Michael Heseltine - say the battle to win over public opinion can be successful, but only if the government adopts a more positive approach.</p> <p>Tony Blair seems to agree with at least part of this assessment. Weekend reports said the prime minister believed a strong government line in favour of the euro would have a significant impact in a referendum, as it did in 1975 when voters decided by a 2 to 1 majority to stay in the EEC.</p> <p>Political analysts believe this would certainly have been true in the summer of 1997. At that time, just after Labour's landslide victory, Mr Blair was the undisputed master of British politics, and like a latter-day Moses could have parted the waters of euro-scepticism and led his people into the promised land. But Labour is less popular than it was in 1997, and scepticism - not just about the euro but about Europe more generally - has grown.</p> <p>Like all UK governments, Labour has had its run-ins with Europe, with Gordon Brown defending the interests of the City over the withholding tax, Clare Short saying last week that the EU was the world's worst development agency and Nick Brown exasperated by the French government's refusal to lift the ban on British beef. The sleaze allegations at the heart of the commission have not helped the cause of the euro enthusiasts either.</p> <p><b> Pivotal issue</b><br></p> <p>The prime minister believes that before a campaign to join the single currency can be fought and won, the case first has to be made for Britain to stay a member of the EU. This is a far cry from the summer of 1997 and, with the Conservatives eager to make the single currency a pivotal issue in the next election campaign, the government has opted for a cautious approach. Hindsight may one day conclude that this was Mr Blair's great strategic error, like Harold Wilson's refusal to discuss devaluation after winning office in 1964 - until it was forced on him in 1967, too late to save his industrial strategy or prevent defeat in 1970.</p> <p>By 1997, the party battle over Europe had been won. A small rump of Old Labour MPs (and peers), not all on the left, remained hostile on either economic or political grounds - or both. But some on the left - Ken Livingstone was typical - who had once opposed the \"capitalist club\" now swung to support the big EU federalist project.</p> <p>For New Labour MPs three years ago, the single currency was barely worth discussing. It was obviously a \"moderniser's\" perspective. Europe good, petty nationalism bad. Devolution for Scotland and Wales, regional government for England too, could easily be fitted into that framework. Unlike more self-deluding Tories, Labour knew the euro would happen on January 1 1999 and said they wanted it to succeed.</p> <p>Even so, the referendum rapidly became an event most likely to occur after Blair had won a second term - probably in late 2001. That was the theory. In the meantime, Labour developed a mantra for dealing with the question of the euro and stuck to it. The government has no objection to joining the single currency in principle, but five economic tests will have to be met first to ensure that the UK has converged with the euro zone.</p> <p>Whether those tests have been met will be considered early in the next parliament, when the government will decide either to hold a referendum or announce that Britain is not yet ready to join.</p> <p>To some euro supporters, this all seems like a colossal loss of nerve. The prime minister and the chancellor see it differently. Firstly, they wanted the first Labour government in almost 20 years to show that it was managerially competent rather than be fixated by Europe. New Labour decided not to jeopardise its honeymoon with the voters, let alone with the Murdoch press, the Mail and Telegraph, by steamrollering the referendum through in autumn 1997.</p> <p>Secondly, it is by no means certain that winning a referendum will be a breeze. British voters are notoriously conservative, and unlike 1975 - when the radical option was to come out of the EEC - the government will have to persuade the electorate to adopt change.</p> <p>Moreover, almost the entire British political, business and media establishment backed the yes campaign in 1975; this time one of the main political parties, more than half the press and a good chunk of business is against.</p> <p><b> Significant barriers</b><br></p> <p>Thirdly, the economics do matter. Although the question of economic convergence is routinely batted away as irrelevant by supporters of British membership of the euro, there were - and are - significant barriers standing in the way of early entry.</p> <p>For all these reasons, Mr Blair felt vulnerable in 1997, and still does. Though instinctively more pro-euro than Mr Brown (not initially realised) he was reluctant to fight the Tory tabloids until he had to.</p> <p>Instead, he urged pro-euro papers, including the FT, Independent, Guardian, Observer and Mirror to fight the cause for him - and berated their caution as they berated his. Only Stephen Byers and Peter Mandelson - who have both listened to the pro-euro lobbying of big business during their spells as trade and industry secretary - have come out with a stronger line.</p> <p>The strengths and weaknesses of the government's line have become apparent over the past three years. Mr Blair's reluctance to fight only when the time is right looks smart in the light of what has happened to the euro.

      "bodyText": "It wasn't meant to be like this. When New Labour swept to power 18 months ahead of the scheduled launch of the EU's single currency, it assumed that the euro would quickly become strong and successful and that the British public would gradually be won over. Instead, voter opposition to the UK joining monetary union has hardened as the euro has become the weakling of the foreign exchanges. The government, which declared three years ago that there were no constitutional barriers to joining the single currency, only economic issues to consider, now finds itself in a tight spot. The government's problem is straightforward. Unlike some countries that have already joined monetary union, Britain will hold a referendum first, and public opposition is running against the single currency by around 3 to 1. Meanwhile, the rest of Europe is losing patience with Britain's wait-and-see approach, with stories emerging from Paris and Berlin of how countries committed to closer ties should be allowed to go it alone. To supporters of UK membership of the euro, this is a familiar story, with Britain losing not just influence but the right to shape European institutions. Some cabinet members - together with leading Conservative euro supporters such as Kenneth Clarke and Michael Heseltine - say the battle to win over public opinion can be successful, but only if the government adopts a more positive approach. Tony Blair seems to agree with at least part of this assessment. Weekend reports said the prime minister believed a strong government line in favour of the euro would have a significant impact in a referendum, as it did in 1975 when voters decided by a 2 to 1 majority to stay in the EEC. Political analysts believe this would certainly have been true in the summer of 1997. At that time, just after Labour's landslide victory, Mr Blair was the undisputed master of British politics, and like a latter-day Moses could have parted the waters of euro-scepticism and led his people into the promised land. But Labour is less popular than it was in 1997, and scepticism - not just about the euro but about Europe more generally - has grown. Like all UK governments, Labour has had its run-ins with Europe, with Gordon Brown defending the interests of the City over the withholding tax, Clare Short saying last week that the EU was the world's worst development agency and Nick Brown exasperated by the French government's refusal to lift the ban on British beef. The sleaze allegations at the heart of the commission have not helped the cause of the euro enthusiasts either. Pivotal issue The prime minister believes that before a campaign to join the single currency can be fought and won, the case first has to be made for Britain to stay a member of the EU. This is a far cry from the summer of 1997 and, with the Conservatives eager to make the single currency a pivotal issue in the next election campaign, the government has opted for a cautious approach. Hindsight may one day conclude that this was Mr Blair's great strategic error, like Harold Wilson's refusal to discuss devaluation after winning office in 1964 - until it was forced on him in 1967, too late to save his industrial strategy or prevent defeat in 1970. By 1997, the party battle over Europe had been won. A small rump of Old Labour MPs (and peers), not all on the left, remained hostile on either economic or political grounds - or both. But some on the left - Ken Livingstone was typical - who had once opposed the \"capitalist club\" now swung to support the big EU federalist project. For New Labour MPs three years ago, the single currency was barely worth discussing. It was obviously a \"moderniser's\" perspective. Europe good, petty nationalism bad. Devolution for Scotland and Wales, regional government for England too, could easily be fitted into that framework. Unlike more self-deluding Tories, Labour knew the euro would happen on January 1 1999 and said they wanted it to succeed. Even so, the referendum rapidly became an event most likely to occur after Blair had won a second term - probably in late 2001. That was the theory. In the meantime, Labour developed a mantra for dealing with the question of the euro and stuck to it. The government has no objection to joining the single currency in principle, but five economic tests will have to be met first to ensure that the UK has converged with the euro zone. Whether those tests have been met will be considered early in the next parliament, when the government will decide either to hold a referendum or announce that Britain is not yet ready to join. To some euro supporters, this all seems like a colossal loss of nerve. The prime minister and the chancellor see it differently. Firstly, they wanted the first Labour government in almost 20 years to show that it was managerially competent rather than be fixated by Europe. New Labour decided not to jeopardise its honeymoon with the voters, let alone with the Murdoch press, the Mail and Telegraph, by steamrollering the referendum through in autumn 1997. Secondly, it is by no means certain that winning a referendum will be a breeze. British voters are notoriously conservative, and unlike 1975 - when the radical option was to come out of the EEC - the government will have to persuade the electorate to adopt change. Moreover, almost the entire British political, business and media establishment backed the yes campaign in 1975; this time one of the main political parties, more than half the press and a good chunk of business is against. Significant barriers Thirdly, the economics do matter. Although the question of economic convergence is routinely batted away as irrelevant by supporters of British membership of the euro, there were - and are - significant barriers standing in the way of early entry. For all these reasons, Mr Blair felt vulnerable in 1997, and still does. Though instinctively more pro-euro than Mr Brown (not initially realised) he was reluctant to fight the Tory tabloids until he had to. Instead, he urged pro-euro papers, including the FT, Independent, Guardian, Observer and Mirror to fight the cause for him - and berated their caution as they berated his. Only Stephen Byers and Peter Mandelson - who have both listened to the pro-euro lobbying of big business during their spells as trade and industry secretary - have come out with a stronger line. The strengths and weaknesses of the government's line have become apparent over the past three years. Mr Blair's reluctance to fight only when the time is right looks smart in the light of what has happened to the euro. Good generals do not throw their forces into the fray when there is no hope of victory. Governments do not call elections they expect to lose. On the other hand, if Labour was not prepared to hold a referendum in the aftermath of 1997, what guarantee is there that it will be any more willing to take the plunge in 2001? There is likely to be only a small window of opportunity before the onset of mid-term blues makes holding a plebiscite fraught with danger, and some Labour insiders now believe that a vote may be put off to a third term, or even indefinitely.

      "body": "<p>Extracts from the unpublished parts of an interview with Robert Harris which appeared in the US in Talk magazine earlier this year:</p> <p>\"The modern media is immensely powerful. It is omnipresent. It makes decision-making often very difficult... There is just a massive and often completely factually inaccurate campaign against Europe run by a very large part of the press that literally suppresses any news that would reflect well on Europe.</p> <p>\"I don't doubt its power and its impact. But I think on Europe Britain will do what is sensible despite media power... They do respond to political leaders who know what they want to do...</p> <p>\"We've made it clear in principle we're in favour of Britain joining the single currency. The reason we say it has to be conditional is because it is an economic union... People ignore this sometimes in a slightly bizarre way. It is an economic union in which you give up control of your exchange rate and your interest rates in the interest of having transparency of costs and of being able to participate more easily in the single market of Europe.</p> <p>\"That economic construction has to be right for Britain. And the truth is that Britain's economy for some time has been slightly more in line really with the US economy than the mainstream continental economics of Europe. So the economics have got to be right.</p> <p>\"But when people say we are hesitant about it - we're not hesitant about it. We've resolved all the issues of principle.</p> <p>\"But the issue of the economic conditions being right and the economic benefits being clear and unambiguous for Britain: that is a real issue. And remember we entered the exchange rate mechanism for political reasons, when Mrs Thatcher was finally pushed for political reasons against her will into the exchange rate mechanism. We joined as a consequence at the wrong rate and at the wrong time - and we paid an enormously heavy penalty for it. And indeed as a result of that harmed the case of Britain in Europe...</p> <p>\"If we decided to make a recommendation to people, the whole dynamics of the argument would change, because the circumstances would have changed. And when people are asked now whether they want to go into the euro, they're asked as of now. Well, the government's position as of now, is not to go into the euro, so it's hardly surprising people say. 'Well, no'.</p> <p>\"But I think when you get underneath it people want to keep the option open. They understand that we live in a different world today. The world's moving closer together.

      "bodyText": "Extracts from the unpublished parts of an interview with Robert Harris which appeared in the US in Talk magazine earlier this year: \"The modern media is immensely powerful. It is omnipresent. It makes decision-making often very difficult... There is just a massive and often completely factually inaccurate campaign against Europe run by a very large part of the press that literally suppresses any news that would reflect well on Europe. \"I don't doubt its power and its impact. But I think on Europe Britain will do what is sensible despite media power... They do respond to political leaders who know what they want to do... \"We've made it clear in principle we're in favour of Britain joining the single currency. The reason we say it has to be conditional is because it is an economic union... People ignore this sometimes in a slightly bizarre way. It is an economic union in which you give up control of your exchange rate and your interest rates in the interest of having transparency of costs and of being able to participate more easily in the single market of Europe. \"That economic construction has to be right for Britain. And the truth is that Britain's economy for some time has been slightly more in line really with the US economy than the mainstream continental economics of Europe. So the economics have got to be right. \"But when people say we are hesitant about it - we're not hesitant about it. We've resolved all the issues of principle. \"But the issue of the economic conditions being right and the economic benefits being clear and unambiguous for Britain: that is a real issue. And remember we entered the exchange rate mechanism for political reasons, when Mrs Thatcher was finally pushed for political reasons against her will into the exchange rate mechanism. We joined as a consequence at the wrong rate and at the wrong time - and we paid an enormously heavy penalty for it. And indeed as a result of that harmed the case of Britain in Europe... \"If we decided to make a recommendation to people, the whole dynamics of the argument would change, because the circumstances would have changed. And when people are asked now whether they want to go into the euro, they're asked as of now. Well, the government's position as of now, is not to go into the euro, so it's hardly surprising people say. 'Well, no'. \"But I think when you get underneath it people want to keep the option open. They understand that we live in a different world today. The world's moving closer together. From January 1, 2002 the euro notes and coins are going to be in circulation. So they'll make up their mind on sensible British grounds. They always do. [And would you consider it a great achievement of your premiership if Britain does go in?] \"Well, it is important for us, and it is a goal, an objective of mine for Britain to be a key and leading player in Europe.

      "body": "<p>Sir John Gielgud, who has died aged 96, blazed a glorious trail through the English theatre of the 20th century and left an indelible imprint upon it. He was the first classical actor of his generation to discard antique modes of Shakespearean interpretation and performance. His Hamlet, Richard II, Leontes, Angelo, Lear and Prospero were acclaimed as thrilling recoveries and discoveries of roles on which the dreariness of convention had long since settled. \"You have to spin it out of yourself, like a spider. It is the only way,\" he said in 1961, and not until extreme old age did he lose that air of effortless spider-like facility.</p> <p>After hesitations and doubts, he rode the surges of the new wave theatre, and revealed himself a remarkable character actor in the plays of Harold Pinter, Alan Bennett and Charles Wood. In 1970, his desolate inmate of a mental institution in David Storey's Home, tears coursing down his face while he maintained a stiff-lipped facade, marked the full flowering of his theatrical Indian summer.</p> <p>He was not, however, just the starriest actor for high strung, tragic heroes half in love with painful suffering, deploying that famous tenor voice which Alec Guinness once apostrophised as being \"like a silver trumpet muffled in silk\". He set new standards in the playing of the artificial high comedy of Congreve, Wilde and Sheridan, to which he brought the breath of naturalness. He revelled in suave villainy and hauteur, in the drawn-out repartee of these periods, sometimes deliciously parodying aspect of his tragic demeanour and voice. He was in his glorious element playing doomed heroes and dandies, neurotics and aesthetes.</p> <p>As a source of inspiration and influence on his profession, he was unrivalled by any actor in his time except for Laurence Olivier. For, in youth and middle age alike, Gielgud was a modern pioneer seeking to fulfil the actor's dream of working in a permanent ensemble, performing classic plays of high quality, where profit was neither motive nor stimulus. The famous companies he assembled in his historic seasons in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s became blueprints for the RSC and National Theatre decades later.</p> <p>The other astonishing aspect of Gielgud's career, which spanned more than 75 years, lay in his ability to recreate and extend himself as fashion and circumstance demanded. He was socially and politically conservative. As a raconteur and conversationalist, scattering his indiscretions and gossip with gay abandon, he may have been the acme of unconventionality. But, theatrically speaking, the shock of the new often shocked him. Since he was also a restless seeker, he learned to rise above the prejudice of his first impressions and to cast aside hidebound convictions.</p> <p>In the 1950s, when the new wave of dramatists broke excitedly upon the London theatre, when Brecht and theatre of the absurd threatened the hold of the upper middle-class drawing-room comedy and the regimen of the well-made play, Gielgud was, at first, left bothered and bewildered, though his astonishing, oriental King Lear, at Stratford for George Devine in 1955, in which the Japanese sculptor and designer, Isamu Noguchi, enveloped him in a mane and head of horses' hair, proved he did not lack the spirit of wild adventure.</p> <p>Yet, unlike Peggy Ashcroft and Olivier, he did not join the avant-garde at the Royal Court in the 1950s and, by the early 1960s, he was beginning to look a thoroughly traditional figure.</p> <p>This isolation from the new did not, however, last that long. Gielgud adjusted, adapted and learned. Critics have suggested he discovered an ideal point of mediation between the old theatre and the new with Alan Bennett's Forty Years On (1968), a revue-like play which regards the totems of England's early 20th-century society with a mixture of mockery and nostalgia. But, in fact, his Broadway performance four years earlier, as a lay brother laid low after being persuaded to marry the richest man in the world, in Edward Albee's mystifyingly symbolic Tiny Alice, marked the point at which he threw in his lot with the nouvelle vague.</p> <p>From then on, Gielgud's career revived. He began to disprove the old slur that he was only able to give a single performance in one voice. In No Man's Land, his sly literary vagrant in search of a billet - the model of bohemian seediness with a cigarette forever between his lips - cast off the familiar Gielgud persona as thoroughly as he did for his 1936 Merchant Of Venice and the 1961 Othello.</p> <p>When his ability to memorise parts for the theatre began to falter in his mid-70s, while playing an archaeologist disturbed by excavations into his own past, in Julian Mitchell's Half Life, Gielgud turned to the world of film. He adapted and fashioned a late career - notably as the conductor-hero of Alain Resnais's Providence (1977), and an ancient, naked Prospero in Peter Greenaway's astonishing version of The Tempest, Prospero's Books (1991).</p> <p>He delighted in the suave malice of the narrator's father in the television version of Bridehead Revisited (1981). He won an Oscar for his performance as Dudley Moore's butler in the Hollywood comedy Arthur (1980). There was even a last stage performance. At the age of 84, he took on the role of Sir Sydney Cokerell, the museum curator in Hugh Whitemore's Best Of Friends, and had a field day with the character's mellow urbanity. Even in his 90s, he capered nimbly through the musical reaches of Shine (1996).</p> <p>The essential Gielgud did not greatly change from first maturity to old age - he was all quick-silver and mercurial intelligence. In rehearsals and life alike, he was impulsive and master of the never-made-up mind. His tongue and ideas for altering performances often ran away with him. His capacity for speaking his mind at the wrong time in the wrong way was a life-long joy - for all except those who suffered the cold blast of truth.</p> <p>Gielgud may have been born into the heart of the conventional upper middle classes of Edwardian England, but this third child of an Edwardian stockbroker had the theatre in his blood. Ellen Terry, Irving's leading lady, was a great aunt. His grandmother, Kate, played Cordelia at 14 and became an instant star. His great uncle, Fred Terry, made his name with the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p> <p>Some have argued that his acting and looks bore no trace of his Terry ancestors. They suggest that his style bears the imprint of his father's Lithuanian forbears, and of his thespian Polish great-grandparents, who were renowned for their Shakespearian acting. Even in his 30s - and remarkable for his great, domed forehead and aquiline nose - he did not look English. Ronald Harwood has suggested that \"the fusion of the Anglo-Saxon and the Slav to be one of the clues to understanding Gielgud's qualities, both as an actor and as a man.\"</p> <p>Educated at Westminster school, Gielgud was stage-struck in childhood, during which the adjectives \"nervous, frail and sensitive\" were attached to him. He became a willowy young man - quick and sharp, with a butterfly mind, who liked to dress in silk socks and broadband black hats, and with fluffy hair which barbers used to wave. He played no school games and walked in stiff self-consciousness - \"like a cat with rickets,\" said one of his first drama teachers. In a theatre which celebrated bluff maleness and matter-of-fact understatement in its leading actors, he seemed the man least likely to take the West End theatre at all, let alone by storm.</p> <p>When Gielgud played his first leading role in London, as Romeo to Gwen Ffrancgon Davies's Juliet in 1924, the critics were loud in their scorn. \"Scant of virility,\" accused Ivor Brown, \"with the most meaningless legs imaginable.\" But perhaps the \"orange\" make-up or coal-black, centre-parted wig and white tights did not help much.</p> <p>It may have been his Slavic heritage that saved him from sinking after this. For it was in the then almost unknown Anton Chekhov that Gielgud made his name. \"Perfection itself,\" said James Agate, the most influential critic of the period, about his Trofimov, the young revolutionary in The Cherry Orchard. His Kontantin in The Seagull, and the doomed Tusenbach in the first English production of The Three Sisters, were almost as eye-catching.</p> <p>So it was that the 25-year-old Gielgud arrived at the Old Vic at the end of the 1920s as leading man - and walked almost straight into theatrical history. In the next 19 months, he took on more Shakespeare leads than any subsequent actor has attempted in twice the time. He was all ages and all types - Romeo and Lear, Orlando and Prospero, Macbeth and Malvolio, Antony and Benedick. One of these roles, his Richard II - \"A tall willowy figure in black velvet . . . the pale agonised face set beneath a glittering crown\" - was the making of him.</p> <p>Critics had already commented on Gielgud's voice, that fabulous piece of machinery which a few detractors have claimed to be capable of making flamboyant music with elongated vowels and little more. The old records of his stage roles disprove that charge. They reveal Gielgud as master architect, building and shaping character minutely. In Shakespeare, he composed a serious intellectual music. His grief-struck Richard, seething with hauteur, anger, self-pity and vulnerability, displayed both his Slavic and Anglo-Saxon aspects - his doomed king exuded emotion that he struggled to keep in check.</p> <p>The Hamlet that followed was more remarkable still - a prince for all seasons, contemporary in its sense of disgust and outrage, instead of traditional ponderous nobility, fresh in its Oedipal stresses and strains. For an age accustomed to mature 40-something Hamlets, it was disconcertingly young; for an age familiar with understatement, it was riven with emotion, \"hysteria and self- lacerating sensitivity.\" James Agate called it \"the highwater mark of English Shakespearian acting in our time.\"</p> <p>Four years later, Gielgud's second prince - bringing Shakespeare daringly into the West End - was less hysterical, more thoughtful and prone to flashes of humour. It was even more feted. The critic JC Trewin said it was the best of the 70 princes he had seen, and, even when Gielgud played the role in his 40s, the likes of the youthful John Mortimer were bowled over all over again.</p> <p>It was, however, in a new, slight costume piece about Richard II - Gordon Daviot's Richard of Bordeaux - that Gielgud really became a star. \"Yes, I know it's vulgar, but I can't resist,\" he said to a friend, as he sat signing picture postcards of himself after a performance. But it was a mark of Gielgud's essential seriousness that he did not succumb to the frippery and shallowness of the 1930s West End. Instead, supported by the impresario Bronson Albery, he set about creating his own company of players in classical drama in St Martin's Lane.</p> <p>It was typical of his eagerness to encourage the new that he cast the young Olivier to alternate with him the roles of Romeo and Mercutio to Peggy Ashcroft's Juliet. It was not supposed to be a theatrical contest. But so it proved, and Olivier, unsurprisingly perhaps, was a love-possessed Romeo from the finger tips to the heart, while Gielgud's Romeo was all surface and no sensuality. When it came to Mercutio, however, Olivier was second-bested. \"John's extraordinary darting imagination made him the better,\" Ashcroft said.</p> <p>Gielgud may have felt pangs of jealousy but they never loomed large - he was always far more of a team player than Olivier, and far more willing to test himself against his best contemporaries.</p> <p>His famous 1937 season at the Queen's, with Peggy Ashcroft as his leading lady, and a repertoire of Richard II, The Merchant Of Venice, The School For Scandal and The Three Sisters, directed by Michel Denis, marked his first attempt to create an ensemble of classical players. But then, tiring of the producer's role, Gielgud was diverted by Binkie Beaumont, who was about to become the most powerful of London impresarios, into a Dodie Smith drawing-room romance.</p> <p>Beaumont, the canniest of producers, was a conservative influence in Gielgud's theatrical life, ranged against the likes of Komisarjevsky, St Denis, Guthrie and Peter Brook, who inspired him to new challenges and to new styles of performance.</p> <p>At least under Beaumont's aegis he was given the chance of launching a bold 1945 season at the Haymarket, which might have been designed to show the ease with which he scaled both the heights of tragedy and comedy. There was his fourth Hamlet, and the abominably cruel Ferdinand in The Duchess Of Malfi, ranged with what the fledgling critic Kenneth Tynan delightedly called his \"tongue-in-cheek and hand-on-heart Valentine in Love For Love.\" In 1953, Beaumont gave him another chance - at the Lyric, Hammersmith - to run his own classical company again. Astutely choosing Paul Scofield as his co-star, Gielgud resuscitated Thomas Otway's tremendous Restoration tragedy, Venice Preserv'd, playing the role of the wracked Jaffier in a dazzle of torment and nobility.</p> <p>In the 1940s, Gielgud consolidated more than he advanced. He was more larch than oak when he played an admired, too youthful Lear, an unwarrior-like Macbeth and a new Italianate Prospero. But there were people who criticised what someone called his \"divine coldness\" - it was as if there were something remote and aloof about his acting.</p> <p>These reservations were set aside in his annus mirabilis at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1950, when he seemed to shed a sense of inhibition and restraint. His Angelo in Measure For Measure, for Peter Brook, marked a new immersion in wickedness. He discovered \"a dark and chilling urgency that froze the blood.\" He was no longer courting sympathy or exuding an easy romanticism. He and Peggy Ashcroft turned Much Ado About Nothing into an exquisite war of words.</p> <p>Anthony Quayle, directing him as Cassius in Julius Caesar, persuaded him to do away with lyricism and softness, and Gielgud achieved a pugilistic fury that astonished the critics. His Leontes, in Peter Brook's A Winter's Tale, confirmed his new-found confidence in playing unsympathetic roles. \"Dressed in hectic red, tall and tortured and rigid, he commands the bare black stage like a fury,\" John Barber wrote.</p> <p>A year later, in the Coronation honours, Gielgud was awarded a long-delayed knighthood, for which Olivier and Richardson had had to lobby the prime minister, Winston Churchill; Gielgud's homosexuality had been the bar to this honour. Then irony and disaster struck in a double action. Just a few months later, when the government was in the midst of a witchhunt against homosexuality, Sir John was charged with persistently importuning for immoral purposes. He admitted his guilt and was fined.</p> <p>The repercussions were great and awful for a man of Gielgud's temperament and character. It was said that he briefly contemplated suicide. \"You can't imagine what it was like,\" he said to me years later. But in his weeks of stress and humiliation, much of the generosity and kindness that he had shown to his fellow actors was returned in full measure. Sybil Thorndike, who was acting with him in A Day By The Sea, led those determined to give support. A move by a minority on the Equity council to have him expelled from the union - and barred from acting - was de feated by a large majority.</p> <p>For a time, the case may have turned Gielgud back to the safe, reassuring world of Binkie Beaumont and HM Tennent. But not for long. In 1957, his \"grizzled ascetic\" Prospero, in whom the fires of revenge and recrimination still blazed, brought an outburst of applause. \"It's the best Shakespearian acting I have seen,\" Richardson wrote to him. And even though miscast as Othello, in Zeffirelli's 1961 RSC production, with a first night rich in falling scenery and collapsing reputations, Gielgud emerged to play a delectable Gayev in The Cherry Orchard - all wistful solemnity, lightly mocking his own pompousness.</p> <p>This ability to ignore set-back and disappointment, to rise to new challenges, characterised the last 20 years of his life in the theatre. He may have had too few chances to play the classics - his last Lear was given when he was little more than 50; his final, necromancing Prospero was something of a comedown. His Julius Caesar and Sir Politick would be unremarkable. But there were at least two great performances. In Home, Gielgud was sheer magic. His Spooner, in Pinter's No Man's Land, was even more of a departure. It marked a feat of self-disguise and impersonation that he had not attempted since his early acting days.</p> <p>Gielgud served the stage unstintingly. No actor was more adored in his time. Indiscreet, self-deprecating, avid for gossip, he strode poker-packed, immaculately dressed, witty, generous and endearing, through thousands of private lives. To listen to him talk in uncensored private was to enjoy a one-man festival of sharp, quaint indiscretions. All his yesterdays seemed to have been such fun. He lived for 40 years with Martin Hensler, and when Martin died a little while ago, the life-force seemed to drain away from him. He wanted to see few people, though he longed for a glimpse of Maggie Smith again.</p> <p>He was a master of acting in an age of great English actors. He encompassed everything from the tragic to the comic ridiculous. He was so old, and had worked for so long, that there will be hardly anyone left alive who can remember our theatre without his magic presence. Those who knew him even a little will lament the passing not just of an actor but of a man who was such infinite, mischievous fun.</p> <p>\u0095 Sir Arthur John Gielgud, actor, born April 14 1904; died May 21 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sir John Gielgud, who has died aged 96, blazed a glorious trail through the English theatre of the 20th century and left an indelible imprint upon it. He was the first classical actor of his generation to discard antique modes of Shakespearean interpretation and performance. His Hamlet, Richard II, Leontes, Angelo, Lear and Prospero were acclaimed as thrilling recoveries and discoveries of roles on which the dreariness of convention had long since settled. \"You have to spin it out of yourself, like a spider. It is the only way,\" he said in 1961, and not until extreme old age did he lose that air of effortless spider-like facility. After hesitations and doubts, he rode the surges of the new wave theatre, and revealed himself a remarkable character actor in the plays of Harold Pinter, Alan Bennett and Charles Wood. In 1970, his desolate inmate of a mental institution in David Storey's Home, tears coursing down his face while he maintained a stiff-lipped facade, marked the full flowering of his theatrical Indian summer. He was not, however, just the starriest actor for high strung, tragic heroes half in love with painful suffering, deploying that famous tenor voice which Alec Guinness once apostrophised as being \"like a silver trumpet muffled in silk\". He set new standards in the playing of the artificial high comedy of Congreve, Wilde and Sheridan, to which he brought the breath of naturalness. He revelled in suave villainy and hauteur, in the drawn-out repartee of these periods, sometimes deliciously parodying aspect of his tragic demeanour and voice. He was in his glorious element playing doomed heroes and dandies, neurotics and aesthetes. As a source of inspiration and influence on his profession, he was unrivalled by any actor in his time except for Laurence Olivier. For, in youth and middle age alike, Gielgud was a modern pioneer seeking to fulfil the actor's dream of working in a permanent ensemble, performing classic plays of high quality, where profit was neither motive nor stimulus. The famous companies he assembled in his historic seasons in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s became blueprints for the RSC and National Theatre decades later. The other astonishing aspect of Gielgud's career, which spanned more than 75 years, lay in his ability to recreate and extend himself as fashion and circumstance demanded. He was socially and politically conservative. As a raconteur and conversationalist, scattering his indiscretions and gossip with gay abandon, he may have been the acme of unconventionality. But, theatrically speaking, the shock of the new often shocked him. Since he was also a restless seeker, he learned to rise above the prejudice of his first impressions and to cast aside hidebound convictions. In the 1950s, when the new wave of dramatists broke excitedly upon the London theatre, when Brecht and theatre of the absurd threatened the hold of the upper middle-class drawing-room comedy and the regimen of the well-made play, Gielgud was, at first, left bothered and bewildered, though his astonishing, oriental King Lear, at Stratford for George Devine in 1955, in which the Japanese sculptor and designer, Isamu Noguchi, enveloped him in a mane and head of horses' hair, proved he did not lack the spirit of wild adventure. Yet, unlike Peggy Ashcroft and Olivier, he did not join the avant-garde at the Royal Court in the 1950s and, by the early 1960s, he was beginning to look a thoroughly traditional figure. This isolation from the new did not, however, last that long. Gielgud adjusted, adapted and learned. Critics have suggested he discovered an ideal point of mediation between the old theatre and the new with Alan Bennett's Forty Years On (1968), a revue-like play which regards the totems of England's early 20th-century society with a mixture of mockery and nostalgia. But, in fact, his Broadway performance four years earlier, as a lay brother laid low after being persuaded to marry the richest man in the world, in Edward Albee's mystifyingly symbolic Tiny Alice, marked the point at which he threw in his lot with the nouvelle vague. From then on, Gielgud's career revived. He began to disprove the old slur that he was only able to give a single performance in one voice. In No Man's Land, his sly literary vagrant in search of a billet - the model of bohemian seediness with a cigarette forever between his lips - cast off the familiar Gielgud persona as thoroughly as he did for his 1936 Merchant Of Venice and the 1961 Othello. When his ability to memorise parts for the theatre began to falter in his mid-70s, while playing an archaeologist disturbed by excavations into his own past, in Julian Mitchell's Half Life, Gielgud turned to the world of film. He adapted and fashioned a late career - notably as the conductor-hero of Alain Resnais's Providence (1977), and an ancient, naked Prospero in Peter Greenaway's astonishing version of The Tempest, Prospero's Books (1991). He delighted in the suave malice of the narrator's father in the television version of Bridehead Revisited (1981). He won an Oscar for his performance as Dudley Moore's butler in the Hollywood comedy Arthur (1980). There was even a last stage performance. At the age of 84, he took on the role of Sir Sydney Cokerell, the museum curator in Hugh Whitemore's Best Of Friends, and had a field day with the character's mellow urbanity. Even in his 90s, he capered nimbly through the musical reaches of Shine (1996). The essential Gielgud did not greatly change from first maturity to old age - he was all quick-silver and mercurial intelligence. In rehearsals and life alike, he was impulsive and master of the never-made-up mind. His tongue and ideas for altering performances often ran away with him. His capacity for speaking his mind at the wrong time in the wrong way was a life-long joy - for all except those who suffered the cold blast of truth. Gielgud may have been born into the heart of the conventional upper middle classes of Edwardian England, but this third child of an Edwardian stockbroker had the theatre in his blood. Ellen Terry, Irving's leading lady, was a great aunt. His grandmother, Kate, played Cordelia at 14 and became an instant star. His great uncle, Fred Terry, made his name with the Scarlet Pimpernel. Some have argued that his acting and looks bore no trace of his Terry ancestors. They suggest that his style bears the imprint of his father's Lithuanian forbears, and of his thespian Polish great-grandparents, who were renowned for their Shakespearian acting. Even in his 30s - and remarkable for his great, domed forehead and aquiline nose - he did not look English. Ronald Harwood has suggested that \"the fusion of the Anglo-Saxon and the Slav to be one of the clues to understanding Gielgud's qualities, both as an actor and as a man.\" Educated at Westminster school, Gielgud was stage-struck in childhood, during which the adjectives \"nervous, frail and sensitive\" were attached to him. He became a willowy young man - quick and sharp, with a butterfly mind, who liked to dress in silk socks and broadband black hats, and with fluffy hair which barbers used to wave. He played no school games and walked in stiff self-consciousness - \"like a cat with rickets,\" said one of his first drama teachers. In a theatre which celebrated bluff maleness and matter-of-fact understatement in its leading actors, he seemed the man least likely to take the West End theatre at all, let alone by storm. When Gielgud played his first leading role in London, as Romeo to Gwen Ffrancgon Davies's Juliet in 1924, the critics were loud in their scorn. \"Scant of virility,\" accused Ivor Brown, \"with the most meaningless legs imaginable.\" But perhaps the \"orange\" make-up or coal-black, centre-parted wig and white tights did not help much. It may have been his Slavic heritage that saved him from sinking after this. For it was in the then almost unknown Anton Chekhov that Gielgud made his name. \"Perfection itself,\" said James Agate, the most influential critic of the period, about his Trofimov, the young revolutionary in The Cherry Orchard. His Kontantin in The Seagull, and the doomed Tusenbach in the first English production of The Three Sisters, were almost as eye-catching. So it was that the 25-year-old Gielgud arrived at the Old Vic at the end of the 1920s as leading man - and walked almost straight into theatrical history. In the next 19 months, he took on more Shakespeare leads than any subsequent actor has attempted in twice the time. He was all ages and all types - Romeo and Lear, Orlando and Prospero, Macbeth and Malvolio, Antony and Benedick. One of these roles, his Richard II - \"A tall willowy figure in black velvet . . . the pale agonised face set beneath a glittering crown\" - was the making of him. Critics had already commented on Gielgud's voice, that fabulous piece of machinery which a few detractors have claimed to be capable of making flamboyant music with elongated vowels and little more. The old records of his stage roles disprove that charge. They reveal Gielgud as master architect, building and shaping character minutely. In Shakespeare, he composed a serious intellectual music. His grief-struck Richard, seething with hauteur, anger, self-pity and vulnerability, displayed both his Slavic and Anglo-Saxon aspects - his doomed king exuded emotion that he struggled to keep in check. The Hamlet that followed was more remarkable still - a prince for all seasons, contemporary in its sense of disgust and outrage, instead of traditional ponderous nobility, fresh in its Oedipal stresses and strains. For an age accustomed to mature 40-something Hamlets, it was disconcertingly young; for an age familiar with understatement, it was riven with emotion, \"hysteria and self- lacerating sensitivity.\" James Agate called it \"the highwater mark of English Shakespearian acting in our time.\" Four years later, Gielgud's second prince - bringing Shakespeare daringly into the West End - was less hysterical, more thoughtful and prone to flashes of humour. It was even more feted. The critic JC Trewin said it was the best of the 70 princes he had seen, and, even when Gielgud played the role in his 40s, the likes of the youthful John Mortimer were bowled over all over again. It was, however, in a new, slight costume piece about Richard II - Gordon Daviot's Richard of Bordeaux - that Gielgud really became a star. \"Yes, I know it's vulgar, but I can't resist,\" he said to a friend, as he sat signing picture postcards of himself after a performance. But it was a mark of Gielgud's essential seriousness that he did not succumb to the frippery and shallowness of the 1930s West End.

It was typical of his eagerness to encourage the new that he cast the young Olivier to alternate with him the roles of Romeo and Mercutio to Peggy Ashcroft's Juliet. It was not supposed to be a theatrical contest. But so it proved, and Olivier, unsurprisingly perhaps, was a love-possessed Romeo from the finger tips to the heart, while Gielgud's Romeo was all surface and no sensuality. When it came to Mercutio, however, Olivier was second-bested. \"John's extraordinary darting imagination made him the better,\" Ashcroft said. Gielgud may have felt pangs of jealousy but they never loomed large - he was always far more of a team player than Olivier, and far more willing to test himself against his best contemporaries. His famous 1937 season at the Queen's, with Peggy Ashcroft as his leading lady, and a repertoire of Richard II, The Merchant Of Venice, The School For Scandal and The Three Sisters, directed by Michel Denis, marked his first attempt to create an ensemble of classical players. But then, tiring of the producer's role, Gielgud was diverted by Binkie Beaumont, who was about to become the most powerful of London impresarios, into a Dodie Smith drawing-room romance. Beaumont, the canniest of producers, was a conservative influence in Gielgud's theatrical life, ranged against the likes of Komisarjevsky, St Denis, Guthrie and Peter Brook, who inspired him to new challenges and to new styles of performance. At least under Beaumont's aegis he was given the chance of launching a bold 1945 season at the Haymarket, which might have been designed to show the ease with which he scaled both the heights of tragedy and comedy. There was his fourth Hamlet, and the abominably cruel Ferdinand in The Duchess Of Malfi, ranged with what the fledgling critic Kenneth Tynan delightedly called his \"tongue-in-cheek and hand-on-heart Valentine in Love For Love.\" In 1953, Beaumont gave him another chance - at the Lyric, Hammersmith - to run his own classical company again.

In the 1940s, Gielgud consolidated more than he advanced. He was more larch than oak when he played an admired, too youthful Lear, an unwarrior-like Macbeth and a new Italianate Prospero. But there were people who criticised what someone called his \"divine coldness\" - it was as if there were something remote and aloof about his acting. These reservations were set aside in his annus mirabilis at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1950, when he seemed to shed a sense of inhibition and restraint.

      "body": "<p>Sinn Fein yesterday piled the pressure on Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble with a warning that the IRA's unprecedented offer to put arms beyond use was at risk because of government concessions over reforms to the RUC.</p> <p>A Sinn Fein source also rejected arguments on flags and the IRA initiative which Mr Trimble is using to sell a return to government to his sceptical Ulster Unionist council. It will vote on Saturday and the outcome is in the balance.</p> <p>Sinn Fein's move, at an official briefing in west Belfast, appeared aimed at reassuring its own supporters. It indicated deepening division over a speedy return to Stormont.</p> <p>It was also designed to force the government to reconsider further concessions on the policing bill, with speculation rife a new attempt would be made later this week to bring John Taylor, deputy leader of the UUP, back behind Mr Trimble.</p> <p>Sinn Fein was worried Mr Trimble might secure only conditional backing for going back into the power-sharing executive, as he did in November. It warned that too would have serious implications for the IRA's move.</p> <p>But, with his critics ready to pounce, Sinn Fein's briefing will hit Mr Trimble hard. His career will be finished if he loses on Saturday.</p> <p>The IRA is offering to allow outside weapons inspectors, Cyril Ramaphosa and Martti Ahtisaari, examine some of its secure dumps. An army council member, Brian Keenan, will again act as interlocutor to John de Chastelain's international commission.</p> <p>Its move was in the context of the full implementation of the Good Friday agreement and the British and Irish governments' statement issued on May 5. Republicans say concessions on policing change that.</p> <p>Mr Trimble has won an indication from Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary, that he will accept an amendment to the bill to make sure the RUC name lives on even though it will not be part of the day-to-day title.</p> <p>Mr Trimble is insisting the IRA still has to decommission its weapons after allowing the inspectors to visit.</p> <p>The Sinn Fein source believed weapons would never be destroyed, saying decommissioning would only be resolved on the IRA's terms.</p> <p>He said: \"With trust, luck, and good discussions between the IRA representative and de Chastelain, you are going to get some way to sort this out which upholds public confidence and can be verifiable.\"</p> <p>The Sinn Fein source also ridiculed Mr Trimble's claim at his press conference yesterday that a government concession on the controversial flags issue would prevent a repeat of Sinn Fein action in banning the union flag for its two ministries on appointed days. Mr Mandelson is to decide where the parties are unable to agree.</p> <p>The Sinn Fein source said it was obvious Martin McGuinness and Bairbre de Brun would refuse to allow the union flag above their departmental buildings.</p> <p>He believed the Good Friday agreement would be finished if Ulster Unionists failed to back Mr Trimble. He said the two governments would become increasingly important, a theme Mr Trimble emphasised as he warned about imposition of joint authority between Dublin and London.</p> <p>Mr Trimble said of Saturday's vote: \"The choice we face is a simple one: we can either put the IRA to the test, or we can take the seemingly easier route and let them off the hook. Saying No to this will only serve to consign unionism to the political wilderness.</p> <p>\"The way will be clear for a return to direct rule, only this time it won't be as before. It will be direct rule with a heavy green pinned to it, with Dublin taking an even bigger say in our affairs, with unionists left with no say at all.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sinn Fein yesterday piled the pressure on Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble with a warning that the IRA's unprecedented offer to put arms beyond use was at risk because of government concessions over reforms to the RUC. A Sinn Fein source also rejected arguments on flags and the IRA initiative which Mr Trimble is using to sell a return to government to his sceptical Ulster Unionist council. It will vote on Saturday and the outcome is in the balance. Sinn Fein's move, at an official briefing in west Belfast, appeared aimed at reassuring its own supporters. It indicated deepening division over a speedy return to Stormont. It was also designed to force the government to reconsider further concessions on the policing bill, with speculation rife a new attempt would be made later this week to bring John Taylor, deputy leader of the UUP, back behind Mr Trimble. Sinn Fein was worried Mr Trimble might secure only conditional backing for going back into the power-sharing executive, as he did in November. It warned that too would have serious implications for the IRA's move. But, with his critics ready to pounce, Sinn Fein's briefing will hit Mr Trimble hard. His career will be finished if he loses on Saturday. The IRA is offering to allow outside weapons inspectors, Cyril Ramaphosa and Martti Ahtisaari, examine some of its secure dumps. An army council member, Brian Keenan, will again act as interlocutor to John de Chastelain's international commission. Its move was in the context of the full implementation of the Good Friday agreement and the British and Irish governments' statement issued on May 5. Republicans say concessions on policing change that. Mr Trimble has won an indication from Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary, that he will accept an amendment to the bill to make sure the RUC name lives on even though it will not be part of the day-to-day title. Mr Trimble is insisting the IRA still has to decommission its weapons after allowing the inspectors to visit. The Sinn Fein source believed weapons would never be destroyed, saying decommissioning would only be resolved on the IRA's terms. He said: \"With trust, luck, and good discussions between the IRA representative and de Chastelain, you are going to get some way to sort this out which upholds public confidence and can be verifiable.\" The Sinn Fein source also ridiculed Mr Trimble's claim at his press conference yesterday that a government concession on the controversial flags issue would prevent a repeat of Sinn Fein action in banning the union flag for its two ministries on appointed days. Mr Mandelson is to decide where the parties are unable to agree. The Sinn Fein source said it was obvious Martin McGuinness and Bairbre de Brun would refuse to allow the union flag above their departmental buildings. He believed the Good Friday agreement would be finished if Ulster Unionists failed to back Mr Trimble. He said the two governments would become increasingly important, a theme Mr Trimble emphasised as he warned about imposition of joint authority between Dublin and London. Mr Trimble said of Saturday's vote: \"The choice we face is a simple one: we can either put the IRA to the test, or we can take the seemingly easier route and let them off the hook. Saying No to this will only serve to consign unionism to the political wilderness. \"The way will be clear for a return to direct rule, only this time it won't be as before. It will be direct rule with a heavy green pinned to it, with Dublin taking an even bigger say in our affairs, with unionists left with no say at all.\"",

      "body": "<p>I have a confession. I'm a shark obsessive. I've seen more than 40 shark documentaries (34 on tape). When I was 12, I asked my mum and dad for a Great White (I planned to keep it in the back garden in a doughnut-shaped pool, so it would never get bored). </p> <p>So you can believe me when I tell you this. If ever you hear the words: \"The shark's reputation (as a man-eating machine) is far more fearsome than the reality...\", it's a lie. </p> <p> The Natural World (BBC2) was subtitled \"Dangerous Australians\", and uttered this fallacy within a minute. Within two, it was using 999-style shark-attack reconstructions to hook the passing viewer, casually trawling the mid-evening waters for the scent of blood. </p> <p>But the film had a more sinister agenda. In actual fact, it was an attempt by the BBC to destroy the Australian tourist industry. </p> <p>In order to achieve this bold aim, narrator \"Jono\" set out his chilling thesis: \"Australian animals are armed with an impressive array of weapons. They bite better, sting better, their venom is unrivalled anywhere else in the world.\" </p> <p>Swiftly, Jono moved on to Stage Two of The Plan: in Australia we don't just have sharks and snakes and spiders, but... flower urchins. </p> <p>Flower urchins may look innocent enough to a small child playing in a rock-pool, but they can cause muscular paralysis. </p> <p>Soon, Jono was claiming that casual visitors to Australia could be fatally attacked by \"venomous trees\", maybe even badly laid concrete slabs. \"There's danger everywhere\", he said. </p> <p>Eventually, a real event was found to be recon structed. \"This is a reconstruction of a true event that happened to Val Plumwood\", Jono explained helpfully over footage of a woman canoeing through a swamp. </p> <p>Val was fantastically factual about the true event: canoeing in her big hat, \"it seemed (suddenly) that my canoe was adjacent to a crocodile\". The beast capsized Val and bit her in half. \"It had me in its jaws... and then it seemed to relax and let me go\", presumably aware that it was being filmed by the BBC. </p> <p>In the 70s, I dimly recollect pandas called Chi Chi and Cha Cha passing through customs at Heathrow on an annual basis. Nowadays smaller animals - frogs and spiders - join us on every flight (they travel cattle class just below the toilets). Animal Airport&gt; (C5) bothered to make a film about this. </p> <p>With cameras shoved just about everywhere bar the back-passage of a drug-smugger in preceding Heathrow series, it was inevitable that the \"Animal Reception Centre\" would be last in line for more of TV's internal examinations. </p> <p>Sadly for C5, there was no camp Jeremy \"character\" waiting to be discovered, just a lot of men in overalls, cleaning up elephant dung. </p> <p>The director even set up a shot with a heron (supposed to appear spontaneously from a box as the voice-over said: \"All sorts of things pop up.\") After the 18th take, the keeper looks up as if to say: \"Did I do that right?\" blissfully unaware that the crew are tearing their hair out. </p> <p> I Saw You (ITV) was just as contrived, but far more cynical. Basically, it was Nick Hornby-Lite.

      "bodyText": "I have a confession. I'm a shark obsessive. I've seen more than 40 shark documentaries (34 on tape). When I was 12, I asked my mum and dad for a Great White (I planned to keep it in the back garden in a doughnut-shaped pool, so it would never get bored). So you can believe me when I tell you this. If ever you hear the words: \"The shark's reputation (as a man-eating machine) is far more fearsome than the reality...\", it's a lie. The Natural World (BBC2) was subtitled \"Dangerous Australians\", and uttered this fallacy within a minute. Within two, it was using 999-style shark-attack reconstructions to hook the passing viewer, casually trawling the mid-evening waters for the scent of blood. But the film had a more sinister agenda. In actual fact, it was an attempt by the BBC to destroy the Australian tourist industry. In order to achieve this bold aim, narrator \"Jono\" set out his chilling thesis: \"Australian animals are armed with an impressive array of weapons. They bite better, sting better, their venom is unrivalled anywhere else in the world.\" Swiftly, Jono moved on to Stage Two of The Plan: in Australia we don't just have sharks and snakes and spiders, but... flower urchins. Flower urchins may look innocent enough to a small child playing in a rock-pool, but they can cause muscular paralysis. Soon, Jono was claiming that casual visitors to Australia could be fatally attacked by \"venomous trees\", maybe even badly laid concrete slabs. \"There's danger everywhere\", he said. Eventually, a real event was found to be recon structed. \"This is a reconstruction of a true event that happened to Val Plumwood\", Jono explained helpfully over footage of a woman canoeing through a swamp. Val was fantastically factual about the true event: canoeing in her big hat, \"it seemed (suddenly) that my canoe was adjacent to a crocodile\". The beast capsized Val and bit her in half. \"It had me in its jaws... and then it seemed to relax and let me go\", presumably aware that it was being filmed by the BBC. In the 70s, I dimly recollect pandas called Chi Chi and Cha Cha passing through customs at Heathrow on an annual basis. Nowadays smaller animals - frogs and spiders - join us on every flight (they travel cattle class just below the toilets). Animal Airport&gt; (C5) bothered to make a film about this. With cameras shoved just about everywhere bar the back-passage of a drug-smugger in preceding Heathrow series, it was inevitable that the \"Animal Reception Centre\" would be last in line for more of TV's internal examinations. Sadly for C5, there was no camp Jeremy \"character\" waiting to be discovered, just a lot of men in overalls, cleaning up elephant dung. The director even set up a shot with a heron (supposed to appear spontaneously from a box as the voice-over said: \"All sorts of things pop up.\") After the 18th take, the keeper looks up as if to say: \"Did I do that right?\" blissfully unaware that the crew are tearing their hair out. I Saw You (ITV) was just as contrived, but far more cynical. Basically, it was Nick Hornby-Lite. One of those dreaded romantic comedies (Rom-Coms, probably prefixed in certain circles with the abbrev: Brit). Here it is: the night Ben sprays MARRY ME in shaving foam all over the sitting room, his girlfriend dumps him. Ben's champagne cork does one of those limp comedy-ejaculations last seen on The Vicar Of Dibley. So Ben embarks on his mumbly, self-deprecating Hornby-quest.

      "trailText": "<p>Cost cuts and Kyoto set scene for a comeback</p>",
      "byline": "David Gow",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Is nuclear energy poised to make a comeback? The question may seem naive given the hammering the industry has taken in recent weeks: British Nuclear Fuels' debacle over its Japanese reprocessing contracts; British Energy's sagging profits and collapsing share price - and safety worries caused by its staff cuts. </p> <p>But there are grounds, most paradoxically environmental reasons, why ministers and the market might view the nuclear option more favourably in years to come and objections to building new power plants may be overcome. </p> <p>Britain's existing nuclear power plants face decommissioning and closure over the next 20 years, starting soon with the Magnox stations owned and managed by BNFL and moving on, from around 2015, to the AGR (advanced gas-cooled reactor) stations belonging to BE. </p> <p>A combination of factors has produced a rapprochement between the industry and the green movement. First, the end is in sight for the most blatant cause of objection: reprocessing of spent fuel rods and the toxic waste that leaves. Japan and Germany want to exit their reprocessing contracts with BNFL, while BE has signalled it wants to rescind its \u00a3300m annual deal with BNFL and switch to dry storage. </p> <p>Energy experts at Friends of the Earth have cautiously welcomed the latter move, with Mark Johnston saying it is \"the least worst option\" and seeing an end to reprocessing here within the decade, probably much sooner. </p> <p>Helen Wallace, a scientist at Greenpeace, is more sceptical, arguing, correctly, that BE's policy shift has been determined by cost-cutting. \"Stopping reprocessing would not make nuclear power acceptable to us because it's still producing waste and there's still a risk of accidents. But we think this move is very significant and definitely a move in the right direction.\" </p> <p>A second reason for revival of the nuclear option is price. Peter Hollins, BE's chief executive, says the government's drive to bring new players into the industry and reduce the market share of National Power and PowerGen has brought wholesale prices down more steeply than anybody envisaged. </p> <p>That and the immediate prospect of new trading arrangements based on a commodity market have propelled prices down 15% already this year and are likely to push them down further; Mr Hollins had expected a fall of 25% would take three years. </p> <p>In the short run this will not benefit nuclear power but coal, according to Tony Cooper, leader of the Engineers &amp; Managers Association, with some 4,000 members in the nuclear industry.</p> <p>With its new \u00a3100m government subsidy, the coal industry is in a better position to compete with alternative fuels such as gas and, though the subsidy means the moratorium on new gas-fired power stations will be lifted, Mr Cooper believes price pressures will inhibit investment in in new plant. </p> <p>The third and most compelling reason for what even Mr Johnston concedes could be \"the slim chance of a come-back\" for nuclear power is environmental. Britain is committed by the Kyoto accord to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 12.5% by 2010 but has opted to raise this to 20%. Mr Cooper says all the recent cuts in greenhouse gases from Britain have been caused by the switch from coal to gas and nuclear. </p> <p>Both Greenpeace and FoE insist that the next leap in reducing greenhouse gases must come from a switch to renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, effectively controlling demand. </p> <p>Helen Liddell, energy minister, wants renewables to provide 10% of Britain's energy mix within 10 years but there is considerable scepticism whether this target can be met. \"Unless the government can do something about transport it's difficult to see how the rate of CO<strong> <sub>2</sub></strong> reduction can be maintained without nuclear,\" Mr Cooper says. </p> <p>\"Not everybody is prepared to stand up and say so but we believe there's an increasing understanding of the role of nuclear in dealing with the greenhouse effect. The only way the UK can meet its Kyoto commitment is because of our increasing output,\" adds Mr Hollins. </p> <p>Mr Johnston says gas remains a better option. But he admits that if CO<strong><sub>2</sub></strong> emissions continue to hit the roof in, say, five years, nuclear could make a comeback. </p> <p>Greenpeace wants all existing plants shut and views any suggestion of new ones as an expensive folly. \"Not only on environmental grounds is nuclear unacceptable but because it would be investing in old technology which has failed economically,\" Ms Wallace says. </p> <p>The industry concedes many of these points. But, says Mr Cooper, there are two factors which could favour a nuclear revival. First, if other forms of generation, notably coal, had to be bear the full cost of environmental impact and a market-driven system came into being, the economics of the nuclear power industry would improve. </p> <p>Second, nuclear technology is changing so it can become intrinsically safe. \"Safety is now based on human and computerised controls but there are designs being worked on in which, if the reactor core started to heat up, the physics of it alone would slow that process and you'd get negative feedback.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Is nuclear energy poised to make a comeback? The question may seem naive given the hammering the industry has taken in recent weeks: British Nuclear Fuels' debacle over its Japanese reprocessing contracts; British Energy's sagging profits and collapsing share price - and safety worries caused by its staff cuts. But there are grounds, most paradoxically environmental reasons, why ministers and the market might view the nuclear option more favourably in years to come and objections to building new power plants may be overcome. Britain's existing nuclear power plants face decommissioning and closure over the next 20 years, starting soon with the Magnox stations owned and managed by BNFL and moving on, from around 2015, to the AGR (advanced gas-cooled reactor) stations belonging to BE. A combination of factors has produced a rapprochement between the industry and the green movement. First, the end is in sight for the most blatant cause of objection: reprocessing of spent fuel rods and the toxic waste that leaves. Japan and Germany want to exit their reprocessing contracts with BNFL, while BE has signalled it wants to rescind its \u00a3300m annual deal with BNFL and switch to dry storage. Energy experts at Friends of the Earth have cautiously welcomed the latter move, with Mark Johnston saying it is \"the least worst option\" and seeing an end to reprocessing here within the decade, probably much sooner. Helen Wallace, a scientist at Greenpeace, is more sceptical, arguing, correctly, that BE's policy shift has been determined by cost-cutting. \"Stopping reprocessing would not make nuclear power acceptable to us because it's still producing waste and there's still a risk of accidents. But we think this move is very significant and definitely a move in the right direction.\" A second reason for revival of the nuclear option is price. Peter Hollins, BE's chief executive, says the government's drive to bring new players into the industry and reduce the market share of National Power and PowerGen has brought wholesale prices down more steeply than anybody envisaged. That and the immediate prospect of new trading arrangements based on a commodity market have propelled prices down 15% already this year and are likely to push them down further; Mr Hollins had expected a fall of 25% would take three years. In the short run this will not benefit nuclear power but coal, according to Tony Cooper, leader of the Engineers &amp; Managers Association, with some 4,000 members in the nuclear industry. With its new \u00a3100m government subsidy, the coal industry is in a better position to compete with alternative fuels such as gas and, though the subsidy means the moratorium on new gas-fired power stations will be lifted, Mr Cooper believes price pressures will inhibit investment in in new plant. The third and most compelling reason for what even Mr Johnston concedes could be \"the slim chance of a come-back\" for nuclear power is environmental. Britain is committed by the Kyoto accord to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 12.5% by 2010 but has opted to raise this to 20%. Mr Cooper says all the recent cuts in greenhouse gases from Britain have been caused by the switch from coal to gas and nuclear. Both Greenpeace and FoE insist that the next leap in reducing greenhouse gases must come from a switch to renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, effectively controlling demand. Helen Liddell, energy minister, wants renewables to provide 10% of Britain's energy mix within 10 years but there is considerable scepticism whether this target can be met. \"Unless the government can do something about transport it's difficult to see how the rate of CO 2 reduction can be maintained without nuclear,\" Mr Cooper says. \"Not everybody is prepared to stand up and say so but we believe there's an increasing understanding of the role of nuclear in dealing with the greenhouse effect. The only way the UK can meet its Kyoto commitment is because of our increasing output,\" adds Mr Hollins. Mr Johnston says gas remains a better option. But he admits that if CO2 emissions continue to hit the roof in, say, five years, nuclear could make a comeback. Greenpeace wants all existing plants shut and views any suggestion of new ones as an expensive folly. \"Not only on environmental grounds is nuclear unacceptable but because it would be investing in old technology which has failed economically,\" Ms Wallace says. The industry concedes many of these points. But, says Mr Cooper, there are two factors which could favour a nuclear revival. First, if other forms of generation, notably coal, had to be bear the full cost of environmental impact and a market-driven system came into being, the economics of the nuclear power industry would improve. Second, nuclear technology is changing so it can become intrinsically safe. \"Safety is now based on human and computerised controls but there are designs being worked on in which, if the reactor core started to heat up, the physics of it alone would slow that process and you'd get negative feedback.\"",

The Department of Culture, Media and Sport yesterday strongly denied suggestions that, because the millennium commission has allocated its full \u00a32bn lottery allocation, the extra grant would be drawn from the new opportunities fund (NOF), the pot of lottery money which funds small community projects around the country. However, while existing and promised NOF projects will not be affected, if the \u00a329m is not paid back, it will not feed into the NOF, inevitably reducing the schemes which could have been funded. The Guardian has learned that the national audit office is to examine whether decisions to award additional grants were carried out appropriately and based on a genuine business case made by NMEC. Mr Gerbeau said: \"I am pleased with the vote of confidence from the commission in terms of their support for our improvements to date.

      "body": "<p>In the dead of a cold October night in 1982, a technical officer from MI5, and an undercover \"operator\" from the army's secret surveillance unit, 14 Intelligence Company (known as 14 Int), covertly entered a hay shed in Ballyneery Road North, a few miles from Lurgan, County Armagh. Inside were 1,000lbs of \"blowie\", fertiliser-based explosives packed in black plastic bags and covered with hay bales. They had been stored there by the IRA. The MI5 officer carefully planted a listening device in one of the rafters, expertly crafted to fit in with its surroundings, and started to run tests apparently by reciting nursery rhymes. The 14 Int technical operator fixed his own wiring device to the hay bales. It was designed to trigger a signal when the IRA moved the bales to get to the explosives.</p> <p>The listening post at which the signals were received was a few miles away, manned by an RUC officer and soldiers from the army's Special Collation Team (SCT). They would record on tape the sounds - and, hopefully, voices - emitted from MI5's device.</p> <p>There were similar operations in place all over the province, primarily designed to gather intelligence. The tapes would be transcribed and routinely destroyed. Normally the hay shed would have been placed under \"eyes on\" surveillance either by 14 Int or its RUC counterpart, E4A, but given the exposed nature of the location in a strong republican area and the high risk of detection by local people or their dogs, a decision was made to rely on MI5's technical expertise and the trigger wire.</p> <p>The decision caused resentment in some quarters of 14 Int, among those who felt they were capable of doing the job and regarded MI5 as \"the pin-stripe brigade in green wellies\". Special Branch was not happy either at leaving everything to MI5. What subsequently happened might have shaken the Security Service to its foundations - had the full story been revealed.</p> <p>The IRA had brought the explosives across the border from Dundalk at the end of September 1982 and stashed them away in the hay shed. The RUC's Special Branch had identified the IRA's main supply route from the south through a highly placed informer within the IRA. Apparently he had been recruited by the army, taken over by Special Branch and put on MI5's payroll. The \"mole\" was gold dust, a source graded \"A\". The plan had been to let the consignment run and catch the IRA's North Armagh unit redhanded, thus putting an end to the mayhem it had caused in the district. Because the intelligence also indicated that the explosives were to be used to pull off a \"spectacular\", the surrounding area was placed out of bounds to the police and army so that there was no danger that they would present themselves as a target. The hay shed and its deadly contents remained under surveillance for several weeks.</p> <p>On October 27 1982, the RUC received a telephone call about a theft in the vicinity of the Kinnego embankment, which was part of the off-limits area. A call was made to see if police could investigate and word came back via Special Branch that they could, a check having been made to ascertain that the explosives were still in the hay shed. Three police officers, Sergeant Sean Quinn and Constables Alan McCloy and Paul Hamilton, were given the green light to proceed along the embankment in an armoured Cortina. At 2.19pm it was blown 70ft in the air by a 1,000lb bomb planted under the road and triggered by remote control, leaving a crater 40ft wide and 15ft deep. The three RUC officers died instantly. The explosives had not been in the hay shed.</p> <p>MI5's listening device had failed and the IRA had removed them under the noses of British intelligence. It appears there had been a signal from the 14 Int technician's trigger on the hay bales but it had been dismissed by the SCT monitors as possibly a dog chasing a chicken, since there had been no corroborating noise from MI5's bug. Had there been human surveillance on the hay shed, three policemen would not have died.</p> <p>That night, Special Branch handlers are thought to have met the \"mole\" and told him to name names. A fortnight later, three local IRA men - Sean Burns, Eugene Toman and Gervaise McKerr - were shot dead by the RUC's SAS-trained anti-terrorist unit in highly controversial circumstances. None of the IRA men was armed. Intelligence reports linked Toman and Burns to the Kinnego bomb. Their deaths fuelled allegations of a \"shoot to kill\" policy.</p> <p>When the covert units searched the hay shed in the wake of the Kinnego explosion, they found the explosives gone and three old German Mauser rifles, without ammunition, left behind. They had not been there when the devices were originally planted. It was assumed that the IRA would return. MI5 installed a second device and the 14 Int operator re-set his trigger, this time under the weapons. The SCT team waited, tape recorders ready, and the RUC's anti-terrorist unit on standby.</p> <p>A fortnight after Toman, Burns and McKerr had, in the words of Lord Justice Gibson been brought \"to the final court of justice\" by the police, there were sounds of movement in the hay shed. This time, MI5's bug was working. The anti-terrorist unit moved in and shot dead 17-year-old Michael Tighe, who had no IRA connections, and seriously wounded his friend, 19-year-old Martin McCauley.</p> <p>McCauley was charged with possession of the weapons. At his trial he said they had entered the hay shed out of curiosity and claimed that the police opened fire without warning and then discussed finishing him off on the ground. The police told a different story. They said that when they heard the sound of a rifle being cocked and \"muffled voices\", they shouted: \"Police. Throw out your weapons.\" They said they repeated it before firing the first shots, after being confronted by two men aiming rifles.</p> <p>The critical question is, who was telling the truth? Was a warning given or was this another example of so-called \"shoot to kill\"? The controversy was intensified the following month when the RUC's anti-terrorist unit shot dead two INLA members in Armagh: Seamus Grew and Roddie Carroll. Again, the circumstances were controversial. Again, neither was armed. Suspicions over \"shoot to kill\" were confirmed when it transpired that the Special Branch officers involved in all three incidents had been instructed to tell lies and fabricate cover stories to protect the \"mole\" and another informer who had provided the vital intelligence.</p> <p>In May 1984, as the furore refused to die down, John Stalker, the deputy chief constable of Greater Manchester, was appointed to head what became generally known as the \"shoot to kill\" inquiry. Six months into his investigation, the team discovered to Stalker's astonishment that the hay shed had been bugged by MI5. In the end they established that that 42 tapes had been made. Tape 42, Stalker concluded, must therefore contain the answer to the vital question: was a warning given?</p> <p>Stalker now felt he was searching for possible evidence of murder. He spent the next 18 months trying to get access to tape 42 and was thwarted at every turn. He was finally told that it had been destroyed. But what he didn't know was that, as a result of an extraordinary sequence of events, a copy of the tape existed.</p> <p>One of the SCT personnel monitoring the device at the time of the shooting had made his own cassette copy of the master, presumably as a macabre souvenir of death captured on tape. A few days later MI5 found out about the cassette and ordered it to be handed over. The unit did as requested and the copy was stored.</p> <p>When Stalker appeared on the scene, there were fears in MI5 circles that the tape would be found so one of the senior MI5 officers in the province ordered one of his MI5 colleagues to destroy it. The vital evidence was gone. By this time, several other members of the security service had heard the tape in addition to members of the SCT. The vast majority heard no warning.</p> <p>Stalker was removed from his inquiry in controversial circumstances in May 1986. The dramatic denouement of the mystery of the missing tape finally came when Colin Sampson, chief constable of West Yorkshire, took over Stalker's team and the inquiry, and began to piece together the rest of the picture. Almost a year later, Sampson delivered his report to the director of public prosecutions in Northern Ireland, Sir Barry Shaw. Neither the Sampson Report nor the Stalker Report, upon which it was based, have seen the light of day.</p> <p>It has always been known that Sampson recommended that police officers should be prosecuted for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and for fabricating cover stories. What has not been known, until now, is that he also recommended that MI5 officers should face the same charge for destroying the copy of the tape.</p> <p>Far from covering up what had happened, Sampson and his team were prepared to have it exposed in open court. The DPP had concluded that there was sufficient evidence to warrant the prosecutions Sampson had recommended. The team had done its homework and nailed those responsible. It was now up to the courts to judge.</p> <p>The Thatcher government was in a quandary. Stalker and Sampson had done their jobs and got to the bottom of what had happened - in particular concerning the hay shed tape. Not to proceed with prosecutions would confirm the widely held suspicion that there had been a conspiracy and cover up. To go ahead and see MI5 officers in the dock being cross-examined about the destruction of the copy of tape 42 would have been political dynamite.</p> <p>By the end of the 80s, MI5 had not yet taken its first tentative steps out of the shadows and the prospect of its officers facing cross-examination on any issue - let alone this - would have been unthinkable in Whitehall. Under the circumstances, the attorney-general, Sir Patrick Mayhew, told the House of Commons in January 1988 that there would be no prosecutions, \"in the public interest\". MPs thought the issue revolved solely around RUC officers since the fact that they had given cover stories had already been revealed. They had no idea it involved MI5 and the destruction of vital evidence.</p> <p>When I asked Lord Mayhew specifically about the prosecution of security service officers, he was reluctant to be drawn. All he would say was, \"a lot of intelligence matters would have been brought out that would have been very deleterious to the intelligence operation that was essential in the circumstances of the time\". Remarkably, however, Sir Robert Andrew, who was permanent under secretary at the Northern Ireland Office at the time, was much more forthright. He told me he had only found out that a copy of the tape had been made and then destroyed when he read the Sampson Report.</p> <p>\"This, if true,\" said Sir Robert, \"was most unfortunate. It was a very difficult one. There was an argument for saying that prosecutions should have been brought to clear the air and to demonstrate that the government was not covering up illegal activities. On the other hand, there was a fear that if police officers, and even more so, officers from the security service, were put in the dock and had to answer questions on oath, intelligence gathering methods and the identity of individuals would have become known and prejudiced the effectiveness of intelligence gathering operations.</p> <p>\"This is why the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Tom King, judged on balance that a prosecution was undesirable.\"</p> <p>Sir Robert, who was present at some of these discussions between King and Mayhew, thereby confirms that the decision not to prosecute was made on political grounds. He was clearly uneasy at the decision. \"It was very difficult,\" he said. \"I think I saw it as a finely balanced case. I don't think I would want to go further than that.\"</p> <p>Perhaps Stella Rimington will enlighten us further in her forthcoming memoirs. Somehow, I doubt it.</p> <p>\u0095 Shoot to Kill, the second part of Peter Taylor's series, Brits, will be shown tomorrow night on BBC2 at 9.30pm.</p>",

The explosives had not been in the hay shed. MI5's listening device had failed and the IRA had removed them under the noses of British intelligence. It appears there had been a signal from the 14 Int technician's trigger on the hay bales but it had been dismissed by the SCT monitors as possibly a dog chasing a chicken, since there had been no corroborating noise from MI5's bug. Had there been human surveillance on the hay shed, three policemen would not have died. That night, Special Branch handlers are thought to have met the \"mole\" and told him to name names. A fortnight later, three local IRA men - Sean Burns, Eugene Toman and Gervaise McKerr - were shot dead by the RUC's SAS-trained anti-terrorist unit in highly controversial circumstances. None of the IRA men was armed. Intelligence reports linked Toman and Burns to the Kinnego bomb. Their deaths fuelled allegations of a \"shoot to kill\" policy. When the covert units searched the hay shed in the wake of the Kinnego explosion, they found the explosives gone and three old German Mauser rifles, without ammunition, left behind. They had not been there when the devices were originally planted. It was assumed that the IRA would return. MI5 installed a second device and the 14 Int operator re-set his trigger, this time under the weapons. The SCT team waited, tape recorders ready, and the RUC's anti-terrorist unit on standby. A fortnight after Toman, Burns and McKerr had, in the words of Lord Justice Gibson been brought \"to the final court of justice\" by the police, there were sounds of movement in the hay shed. This time, MI5's bug was working. The anti-terrorist unit moved in and shot dead 17-year-old Michael Tighe, who had no IRA connections, and seriously wounded his friend, 19-year-old Martin McCauley. McCauley was charged with possession of the weapons. At his trial he said they had entered the hay shed out of curiosity and claimed that the police opened fire without warning and then discussed finishing him off on the ground. The police told a different story. They said that when they heard the sound of a rifle being cocked and \"muffled voices\", they shouted: \"Police. Throw out your weapons.\" They said they repeated it before firing the first shots, after being confronted by two men aiming rifles. The critical question is, who was telling the truth? Was a warning given or was this another example of so-called \"shoot to kill\"? The controversy was intensified the following month when the RUC's anti-terrorist unit shot dead two INLA members in Armagh: Seamus Grew and Roddie Carroll. Again, the circumstances were controversial. Again, neither was armed. Suspicions over \"shoot to kill\" were confirmed when it transpired that the Special Branch officers involved in all three incidents had been instructed to tell lies and fabricate cover stories to protect the \"mole\" and another informer who had provided the vital intelligence. In May 1984, as the furore refused to die down, John Stalker, the deputy chief constable of Greater Manchester, was appointed to head what became generally known as the \"shoot to kill\" inquiry. Six months into his investigation, the team discovered to Stalker's astonishment that the hay shed had been bugged by MI5. In the end they established that that 42 tapes had been made. Tape 42, Stalker concluded, must therefore contain the answer to the vital question: was a warning given? Stalker now felt he was searching for possible evidence of murder. He spent the next 18 months trying to get access to tape 42 and was thwarted at every turn. He was finally told that it had been destroyed. But what he didn't know was that, as a result of an extraordinary sequence of events, a copy of the tape existed. One of the SCT personnel monitoring the device at the time of the shooting had made his own cassette copy of the master, presumably as a macabre souvenir of death captured on tape. A few days later MI5 found out about the cassette and ordered it to be handed over. The unit did as requested and the copy was stored. When Stalker appeared on the scene, there were fears in MI5 circles that the tape would be found so one of the senior MI5 officers in the province ordered one of his MI5 colleagues to destroy it. The vital evidence was gone. By this time, several other members of the security service had heard the tape in addition to members of the SCT. The vast majority heard no warning. Stalker was removed from his inquiry in controversial circumstances in May 1986. The dramatic denouement of the mystery of the missing tape finally came when Colin Sampson, chief constable of West Yorkshire, took over Stalker's team and the inquiry, and began to piece together the rest of the picture. Almost a year later, Sampson delivered his report to the director of public prosecutions in Northern Ireland, Sir Barry Shaw. Neither the Sampson Report nor the Stalker Report, upon which it was based, have seen the light of day. It has always been known that Sampson recommended that police officers should be prosecuted for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and for fabricating cover stories. What has not been known, until now, is that he also recommended that MI5 officers should face the same charge for destroying the copy of the tape. Far from covering up what had happened, Sampson and his team were prepared to have it exposed in open court. The DPP had concluded that there was sufficient evidence to warrant the prosecutions Sampson had recommended. The team had done its homework and nailed those responsible. It was now up to the courts to judge. The Thatcher government was in a quandary. Stalker and Sampson had done their jobs and got to the bottom of what had happened - in particular concerning the hay shed tape. Not to proceed with prosecutions would confirm the widely held suspicion that there had been a conspiracy and cover up. To go ahead and see MI5 officers in the dock being cross-examined about the destruction of the copy of tape 42 would have been political dynamite. By the end of the 80s, MI5 had not yet taken its first tentative steps out of the shadows and the prospect of its officers facing cross-examination on any issue - let alone this - would have been unthinkable in Whitehall. Under the circumstances, the attorney-general, Sir Patrick Mayhew, told the House of Commons in January 1988 that there would be no prosecutions, \"in the public interest\". MPs thought the issue revolved solely around RUC officers since the fact that they had given cover stories had already been revealed. They had no idea it involved MI5 and the destruction of vital evidence. When I asked Lord Mayhew specifically about the prosecution of security service officers, he was reluctant to be drawn. All he would say was, \"a lot of intelligence matters would have been brought out that would have been very deleterious to the intelligence operation that was essential in the circumstances of the time\". Remarkably, however, Sir Robert Andrew, who was permanent under secretary at the Northern Ireland Office at the time, was much more forthright. He told me he had only found out that a copy of the tape had been made and then destroyed when he read the Sampson Report. \"This, if true,\" said Sir Robert, \"was most unfortunate. It was a very difficult one. There was an argument for saying that prosecutions should have been brought to clear the air and to demonstrate that the government was not covering up illegal activities. On the other hand, there was a fear that if police officers, and even more so, officers from the security service, were put in the dock and had to answer questions on oath, intelligence gathering methods and the identity of individuals would have become known and prejudiced the effectiveness of intelligence gathering operations. \"This is why the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Tom King, judged on balance that a prosecution was undesirable.\" Sir Robert, who was present at some of these discussions between King and Mayhew, thereby confirms that the decision not to prosecute was made on political grounds. He was clearly uneasy at the decision. \"It was very difficult,\" he said. \"I think I saw it as a finely balanced case. I don't think I would want to go further than that.\" Perhaps Stella Rimington will enlighten us further in her forthcoming memoirs. Somehow, I doubt it. \u0095 Shoot to Kill, the second part of Peter Taylor's series, Brits, will be shown tomorrow night on BBC2 at 9.30pm.",

Mr Potter - who led the push for the recent change because he feared stifling the burgeoning e-economy - welcomed the government's response to some of the industry's concerns but said that it was still burdening entrepreneurs with a \"quite onerous\" tax bill. The changes announced late on Friday would still leave employees facing a 47.5% tax charge when they exercised any options over shares, he said, which was still \"quite high\" in comparison with other countries. Until Friday it was the companies themselves that faced the bill for the national insurance contribution for employees when they exercised share options - an increasingly common form of remuneration for start-up companies. After last week's announcement, the company can now shift the tax charge to each employee, provided they agree, and each will also receive new tax relief allowing them to offset any national insurance contribution against the income tax on the share options gains, which will reduce the overall tax rate to some 47.5%. Previously the overall tax bill would have 52.5% - consisting of 40% income tax and 12.5% national insurance. The decision to shift the tax burden to the employee is helping to address the issue for start-up firms which have irregular cashflows, making it difficult for them to account for potential tax charges, Mr Potter said. But he intends carrying on campaigning for an overhaul of the way the share options are treated for tax purposes. He said that the core of his argument would be for lower tax charges which at the same time reward employees who retain their shares in the firm once the options have been exercised.

      "bodyText": "The decomposing bodies of at least six United Nations peacekeepers believed to have been murdered by rebels have been discovered in Sierra Leone. The dead soldiers - wearing Nigerian, Zambian and Kenyan uniforms with UN patches - are believed to have been among about 500 peacekeepers abducted by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) earlier this month. The apparent cold-blooded killing of some of the remaining 280 hostages in rebel hands will reinforce pressure for a military solution. It comes on the eve of a key meeting in which British ministers are expected to agree to rearm the Sierra Leone army. Vice admiral Ian Garnett, the chief of joint operations at the Ministry of Defence, told journalists on board HMS Ocean, one of the eight British warships off the coast of Sierra Leone: \"It is very important to give them as much support as we can, to build up an effective force to take on the rebels.\" He added: \"We will have to consider other measures that the government of Sierra Leone has requested and see whether we can help them in the field of logistics, ammunition and perhaps other weapons.\" Ministers are poised to send in 600 marine commandos to replace the 700 paratroopers who have been securing the area in and around Freetown and Lungi airport. In London, Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, said the gov ernment was considering a request for arms from President Ahmad Kabbah \"very carefully\". Clare Short, the international development secretary, said: \"Anyone who wishes Sierra Leone a decent future with a proper democracy and security has to think about how the international community are going to help it to have properly equipped and trained armed forces so that security can be maintained.\" In New York, the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, proposed strengthening the peacekeeping force to 16,500 from 13,000, and said it might have to be raised even further. In a report to the security council, he said it might wish to consider toughening existing arms and other sanctions against the RUF to prevent them from \"reaping the benefits of their illegal exploitation of mineral resources, in particular diamonds\". Mr Annan said it was clear that the RUF leader, Foday Sankoh, who is in the custody of the Sierra Leone authorities, had failed to take any action to prevent or curb the actions of his troops. \"On the contrary, there is some evidence that he may well have encouraged, if not planned, some of these acts [taking of the hostages]. The international community should hold Mr Sankoh accountable for his actions and those of [the] RUF, and for the safety and well-being of all those who have been detained,\" Mr Annan said.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair made a mild u-turn yesterday when he announced that he would take two weeks' paternity leave to care for his new son Leo. After insisting for months that he would remain on duty after the birth, Mr Blair handed over most of the reins of power to his deputy, John Prescott, who will take this week's prime minister's questions and chair Thursday's meeting of the cabinet. Mr Blair will remain on standby for emergencies in Northern Ireland and Sierra Leone, and will return to his desk on Tuesday June 6 after the Whitsun break. He will have his weekly audience with the Queen this evening. The announcement came as Downing Street released the first photographs of the Blairs with their baby son. They were taken in Downing Street on Sunday by Mary McCartney, daughter of the Beatle Sir Paul, who was chosen by Cherie Blair. One photograph was made available free to the media. A further 14 were available for \u00a3500 each, with the proceeds going to two charities of which Mrs Blair is patron - Breast Cancer Care and Sargent Cancer Care for Children. The greatest interest came from Japan, Germany and the United States. The Downing Street website crashed as people tried to view the picture of Leo. When the Blairs leave for Chequers, possibly on Thursday or Friday, TV cameras will be allowed to film Leo for the first time.",

His end came \"simply of old age\" at his home near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, on Sunday, 79 years after his first London stage appearance. His last performance, filmed just weeks ago, was for Samuel Beckett's play Catastrophe, part of a marathon Channel Four and RTE-funded project to film all the playwright's works. Yesterday's tributes to the actor were suffused with awe and regret at the passing of an unprecedently long-active genius, the last of a group of titanic actors who graced theatres for much of the 20th century. The National Theatre director, Trevor Nunn, and the actor Corin Redgrave reached for epitaphs from Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra to do him justice. Nunn said: \"There's a great spirit gone.\" Redgrave - whose father, Sir Michael, was deeply influenced by Gielgud - said: \"The odds is gone/ And there is nothing left remarkable beneath the visiting moon.\" Immediate reaction to the news was more profound than for his great contemporary and lifelong rival Lord Olivier's death 11 years ago. As recently as the 1990s, he played an outstanding radio Hamlet, a part he first played on stage in the 1920s in what a critic then called \"the highwater mark of acting in our time\". His former agent Laurence Evans, who also represented Olivier and Sir Ralph Richardson, said: \"I suppose that, of the three, Sir John was really the greatest actor.\" The stage director Peter Brook said that comparisons \"could not matter less.

      "body": "<p>From the time Roger Lyons wakes up to listen to the Today programme to his last glass of wine at night, the expenses meter is running for his 700,000 members .</p> <p>The extraordinary expense account lifestyle of trade union leader Roger the Dodger - the jokey name given to him by colleagues - is revealed today in a series of confidential documents obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>The papers have come to light because of a bitter internal row inside the Manufacturing, Science and Finance (MSF) white collar union over the lifestyle of Mr Lyons. At the centre are disputes with senior colleagues over nearly \u00a310,000 of purchases on the union's credit cards and almost \u00a34,000 of other disputed expenses. Mr Lyons - who earns \u00a368,000 a year and gets an additional \u00a315,000 for serving on the monopolies and mergers commission - has been accused of running up thousands of pounds of expense claims by the former assistant general secretary John Chowcatt, who left the union with a \u00a3250,000 settlement. The union's accountants investigated and cleared Mr Lyons of any wrongdoing. He was allowed to spend \u00a36,366.70 on hotels and meals over nine months. Out of another \u00a32,757.90, described as sustenance, \u00a3877 was spent near his Finchley home in takeaway restaurants and off licences.</p> <p>One trade union colleague said: \"They are not huge sums in themselves but if it happens on a daily basis it soon mounts up.\"</p> <p>Mr Lyons has also submitted bills for office equipment - a total of \u00a31,869.10 - which cover everything from the purchase of batteries to internet services, radios, video recorders and a briefcase.</p> <p>His day begins with listening to the Today programme on a union-bought radio in his bathroom at 6.30am.</p> <p>He told the Guardian: \"My wife hates hearing the Today programme when we are in bed. I could listen to our own radio with earphones - but it is not very satisfactory so I go into the bathroom to hear the programme on the union's radio.\"</p> <p><b> Leather briefcase</b><br></p> <p>Then, if he has time, he will watch TV programmes on the union-provided video recorder (\u00a3169.99 from Curry's), recorded so as not to disturb the family. Finally, he will check the internet (installed and serviced for \u00a3777 by the union), which is also used by the family.</p> <p>He then puts his papers in his leather briefcase (bought by the union from Selfridges for \u00a389) and is driven by his chauffeur to work. (His former driver, Brian Keegan, is taking the union to a tribunal for thousands of pounds of unpaid overtime for driving Mr Lyons).</p> <p>At his central London offices, the union has a strategy meeting at which tea, coffee and biscuits are normally provided. But Mr Lyons regularly claims expenses for \"sustenance\" - claims which reached \u00a3371.45 between January 5 1997 and September 19 1998. The unreceipted claims varied from \u00a34 to \u00a318.50 - and Mr Lyons justified them by saying that he might have to talk to the press afterwards.</p> <p>Occasionally, meetings might be required with MSF's parliamentary colleagues - and again both food and drink are often provided by the union. But Mr Lyons also puts in claims for those, from \u00a32.50 to \u00a311.40. He says this is because he had to go to the Commons Strangers Bar - and pass cash to MPs to buy him a drink - which is why no receipts are available.</p> <p>Meetings with Tony Blair and Gordon Brown ,who regularly supply tea and coffee and even the odd biscuit and sandwich, also led to sustenance claims from Mr Lyons. Ten meetings led to a claim of \u00a364.15, with bills varying from \u00a34 for seeing Tony Blair to \u00a319.65 for a meeting with Gordon Brown.</p> <p>\"Of course, they do provide coffee, but if they are in the evening I would go and have a bite and a pint at the Red Lion in Whitehall afterwards,\" Mr Lyons told the Guardian.</p> <p>On other evenings it could be an interview with the BBC at Millbank or ITN. Total unreceipted expenses for these appearances, where refreshments are usually provided, came to \u00a3174.95.</p> <p>And then there were the mid-morning snacks - right down to a claim on his credit card for a 25p bun from Patisserie Valerie in Soho.</p> <p>On days when there were no scheduled meetings Mr Lyons might still work late. When he was driven home, he might buy a bottle of wine from a Victoria Wine off licence or a takeaway from Pizza Express, all claimed on expenses and adding up to \u00a3877. Some \u00a3259 was spent on wine or beer.</p> <p>Nor did the claims stop during holidays and foreign trips. Mr Lyons's personal annual travel insurance on his American Express card is paid by the union at a cost of \u00a3133.95, even though the union insures its officers on business abroad.</p> <p>Controversial entries also concerned the union's delegation to the IMF conference in Darmstadt, Germany, in May 1998. His credit card record showed he purchased a ticket for Le Shuttle for \u00a3159 then another ticket for the Eurostar train for \u00a3130.50 and claimed petrol in France and Germany. His explanation is that his wife was entitled to go on the trip and could not go at the same time.This answer was accepted by the union's accountants when they looked into his expenses claims.</p> <p>He also claimed petrol on his way to his second home in the south of France, where he claimed a meal for his family and petrol for a trip. Here the explanation is that on the way he had to do a BBC World at One interview with the then trade secretary, Peter Mandelson, at Lyon. He claimed it as a working day. He records it as \"three hours of work with Peter Mandelson\".</p> <p>One of the largest claims is for drinks at the union's 1998 Christmas reception where \u00a3831.74 was spent on alcohol for 75 guests. The explanation is that excess drinks were kept and used elsewhere for entertaining on the union's behalf.</p> <p>Mr Lyons told the Guardian that his expenses arrangement was a big improvement on the days of Clive Jenkins who had \u00a310,000 a year to spend without justifying a penny.</p> <p>\"I want to make it clear that we are an open union. The only reason why the papers on this are confidential is that they involve personal expense.\"</p> <p>The fact that the documents will be used in possiibly three tribunal cases against the union - starting in July - and the union is now facing an austerity programme to cut costs are \"just mischief-making,\" he said.</p> <p>An internal inquiry by the union's accountants into Mr Lyons's expense claims has cleared him of breaking union rules. <br><br><b> Selection of items on Roger Lyons's \"disputed\" expenses list:</b></p> <p>\u0095Two radios from Tempo, \u00a378.21 - one for his office and one for his bathroom, justified because he has to listen to the Radio 4 Today programme in the bath</p> <p>\u0095One dedicated video recorder from Curry's, \u00a3169.99 - for home use, justified because he needs to watch MSF-supplied videos at home</p> <p>\u0095One leather briefcase from Selfridges, \u00a389 - for union business</p> <p>\u0095Push trolley from the Army and Navy Stores, \u00a330 - justified because the union one was of poor quality</p> <p>\u0095Meeting Tony Blair at Downing Street, \u00a34.50 - sustenance</p> <p>\u0095Meeting Gordon Brown at the Treasury, \u00a319.65 - sustenance</p> <p>\u0095Bun at Patisserie Valerie, Soho, central London, bought on credit card for 25p</p>",

He says this is because he had to go to the Commons Strangers Bar - and pass cash to MPs to buy him a drink - which is why no receipts are available. Meetings with Tony Blair and Gordon Brown ,who regularly supply tea and coffee and even the odd biscuit and sandwich, also led to sustenance claims from Mr Lyons. Ten meetings led to a claim of \u00a364.15, with bills varying from \u00a34 for seeing Tony Blair to \u00a319.65 for a meeting with Gordon Brown. \"Of course, they do provide coffee, but if they are in the evening I would go and have a bite and a pint at the Red Lion in Whitehall afterwards,\" Mr Lyons told the Guardian. On other evenings it could be an interview with the BBC at Millbank or ITN. Total unreceipted expenses for these appearances, where refreshments are usually provided, came to \u00a3174.95. And then there were the mid-morning snacks - right down to a claim on his credit card for a 25p bun from Patisserie Valerie in Soho. On days when there were no scheduled meetings Mr Lyons might still work late. When he was driven home, he might buy a bottle of wine from a Victoria Wine off licence or a takeaway from Pizza Express, all claimed on expenses and adding up to \u00a3877. Some \u00a3259 was spent on wine or beer. Nor did the claims stop during holidays and foreign trips. Mr Lyons's personal annual travel insurance on his American Express card is paid by the union at a cost of \u00a3133.95, even though the union insures its officers on business abroad. Controversial entries also concerned the union's delegation to the IMF conference in Darmstadt, Germany, in May 1998. His credit card record showed he purchased a ticket for Le Shuttle for \u00a3159 then another ticket for the Eurostar train for \u00a3130.50 and claimed petrol in France and Germany. His explanation is that his wife was entitled to go on the trip and could not go at the same time.This answer was accepted by the union's accountants when they looked into his expenses claims. He also claimed petrol on his way to his second home in the south of France, where he claimed a meal for his family and petrol for a trip. Here the explanation is that on the way he had to do a BBC World at One interview with the then trade secretary, Peter Mandelson, at Lyon. He claimed it as a working day. He records it as \"three hours of work with Peter Mandelson\". One of the largest claims is for drinks at the union's 1998 Christmas reception where \u00a3831.74 was spent on alcohol for 75 guests. The explanation is that excess drinks were kept and used elsewhere for entertaining on the union's behalf. Mr Lyons told the Guardian that his expenses arrangement was a big improvement on the days of Clive Jenkins who had \u00a310,000 a year to spend without justifying a penny. \"I want to make it clear that we are an open union. The only reason why the papers on this are confidential is that they involve personal expense.\" The fact that the documents will be used in possiibly three tribunal cases against the union - starting in July - and the union is now facing an austerity programme to cut costs are \"just mischief-making,\" he said. An internal inquiry by the union's accountants into Mr Lyons's expense claims has cleared him of breaking union rules. Selection of items on Roger Lyons's \"disputed\" expenses list: \u0095Two radios from Tempo, \u00a378.21 - one for his office and one for his bathroom, justified because he has to listen to the Radio 4 Today programme in the bath \u0095One dedicated video recorder from Curry's, \u00a3169.99 - for home use, justified because he needs to watch MSF-supplied videos at home \u0095One leather briefcase from Selfridges, \u00a389 - for union business \u0095Push trolley from the Army and Navy Stores, \u00a330 - justified because the union one was of poor quality \u0095Meeting Tony Blair at Downing Street, \u00a34.50 - sustenance \u0095Meeting Gordon Brown at the Treasury, \u00a319.65 - sustenance \u0095Bun at Patisserie Valerie, Soho, central London, bought on credit card for 25p",

Issues such as does the media get a picture on his first day of school will have a whole set of complicated political implications - is Mr Blair trying to boost his profile?</p> <p>Then there is the uncertainty of it all; William and Harry didn't have to consider the possibility of being chucked out of their childhood home by an election. From being one of the most famous four-year-olds in the world, this baby could disappear into oblivion.

In 1908, Elizabeth and Anthony Asquith aged 11 and five moved in with Pa Herbert. It didn't do them any damage; Elizabeth went on to marry a prince and wrote poetry and plays, while Anthony became a respected film director. The difference between all of them and this new baby was that at least they had an inkling of a life outside the fishbowl of Number 10 before they moved in.</p> <p>Disturbingly, the closest parallel is that of the Kennedys: little Caroline and John fascinated the nation as they toddled in and out of the Oval Office. They became, along with their beautiful, clever mother, a crucial part of the political message of Kennedy's presidency.</p> <p>Whether Cherie likes it or not (and there seems to be evidence of a bit of both) she and this baby are destined to play a similar role in Tony's prime ministership at the next election. We'll have to wait many years to hear this baby's verdict on his own contribution to the New Labour project.</p> <p>madeleine.bunting@ theguardian.com</p>",

From the start, the two princes were surrounded by an effective wall of courtiers adept at protecting the royal family and inculcating in them an inescapable ethic of duty as part of their birthright. This baby will not have the protection of a royal household or an elaborate system of royal etiquette. Issues such as does the media get a picture on his first day of school will have a whole set of complicated political implications - is Mr Blair trying to boost his profile? Then there is the uncertainty of it all; William and Harry didn't have to consider the possibility of being chucked out of their childhood home by an election. From being one of the most famous four-year-olds in the world, this baby could disappear into oblivion. Suddenly, he could wake up to discover that chauffeured cars are not always waiting, that there isn't always a policeman to open the door and that crowds of tourists (or demonstrators) don't always stand around gawping at you and your family. Of course other children have lived in Downing Street - most obviously, Leo's older siblings. In 1908, Elizabeth and Anthony Asquith aged 11 and five moved in with Pa Herbert. It didn't do them any damage; Elizabeth went on to marry a prince and wrote poetry and plays, while Anthony became a respected film director. The difference between all of them and this new baby was that at least they had an inkling of a life outside the fishbowl of Number 10 before they moved in. Disturbingly, the closest parallel is that of the Kennedys: little Caroline and John fascinated the nation as they toddled in and out of the Oval Office. They became, along with their beautiful, clever mother, a crucial part of the political message of Kennedy's presidency. Whether Cherie likes it or not (and there seems to be evidence of a bit of both) she and this baby are destined to play a similar role in Tony's prime ministership at the next election. We'll have to wait many years to hear this baby's verdict on his own contribution to the New Labour project. madeleine.bunting@ theguardian.com",

Once on the wing this species has the longest flight period of any of the county's damselflies, extending through the summer months into early autumn, being at its peak in June and July. I disturbed two of these fragile insects from some low reeds at the edge of a small marl pit on rough grassland on the early date of April 26 this year. A week later I came across more in several of the ponds and pits on the same site, fluttering weakly from stem to stem in the edge vegetation. The damselflies are a smaller, much more delicate version of the true-dragonflies, although both are in the same insect order, Odonata, meaning \"toothed\", which relates to their carnivorous lifestyle. Much folklore has been built up around these insects, especially the true-dragonflies with such names as \"horse-stingers\" - maybe because of the latters' large size, swift flight, and the occasional rustling of their wings as they swoop about. However, both are harmless and stingless, and in fact perform a great deal of good for the comfort of we humans by keeping down the numbers of mosquitoes and other small irritating flies which make up the bulk of their diet. There are a number of features that help to separate the two groups but usually close observation is required, which is not always easy to achieve. Probably the simplest guide is to watch them at rest - the damselfly will hold its wings together over its back, while the true-dragonfly spreads its wings out flat, away from the body.

Could it possibly be that Steve (or Mimi, as he may now be known ) is seeking to reassure himself that he remains a figure to be respected in this business, despite so poignantly brief a spell as editor of the Independent on Sunday?

One minute he's in Downing Street ruthlessly invading his three elder children's privacy by parading that mug, the next he makes a point of buying the Big Issue outside Westminster Cathedral, naturally unaware that the odd camera might be following him on the day after the baby's birth. Sooooo spontaneous! Sources in Downing Street refuse to confirm, meanwhile, that a pullover specially treated with dried baby sick is being kept in the press office safe in readiness for all future media engagements. \u0095The deconstruction of my sensitive friend Steve Glover's latest column in the Spectator is complete and the major finding is this: in a column of about 900 words, the words \"I\", \"me\" and \"my\" appear on 26 occasions. Amazing. Could it possibly be that Steve (or Mimi, as he may now be known ) is seeking to reassure himself that he remains a figure to be respected in this business, despite so poignantly brief a spell as editor of the Independent on Sunday? He must be helped to put that trauma behind him and achieve \"closure\". But how? That's the question. How? \u0095An ironist of potential emerges at cup-winning Chelsea, home of football's best known Guardian reader, Graeme Le Saux. It is Graeme's colleague Roberto di Matteo, the Italian midfielder. \"That's a very intelligent question,\" replied Roberto on Saturday afternoon when asked by a Sky sports reporter if it felt good to score the winning goal at Wembley. In the FA Cup final.",

Jack Straw will announce today the move to make companies criminally accountable for deaths which are the result of gross negligence. For the first time directors of rail and shipping companies could find themselves in the Old Bailey dock if it is shown that transport disasters are the direct result of corporate conduct far below what could be reasonably expected. It will be enough to show that there was a management failure for a company to be responsible even if the immediate cause was the act of an individual member of staff. The decision follows years of campaigning by families who have lost relatives in disasters such as the Paddington and Southall rail crashes and repeated rulings that companies could not be prosecuted for manslaughter by gross negligence because it has proved impossible to establish the guilt of a named individual. Mr Straw is understood to want to go further than the recommendations of the law commission which first advised the government to create the offence as long ago as 1995. The commission recommended that there should be a special offence of corporate killing which was broadly similar to the individual crime of killing by gross negligence. It said that corporate killing could only be committed in cases where it was demonstrated that the defendant's conduct fell far below what could reasonably be expected. The commission added that, unlike the individual offence of killing by gross negligence, it did not have to be proved that the risk was obvious to the company or that the company was capable of appreciating the risk. The commission also said it should be enough to prove the new crime of corporate killing if it is caused by \"a failure, in the way in which the corporation's activities are managed or organised, to ensure the health and safety of persons employed in or affected by those activities\". The offence will be limited to disasters that happen in areas where the English courts have jurisdiction and relatives of those who die will be able to bring private prosecutions. Earlier this month, the DPP, David Calvert-Smith, said that the current law was insufficient to deal with culpable conduct.

      "bodyText": "The Israeli air force was active over South Lebanon yesterday, but this time, instead of attacking Hizbullah bases, it bombarded abandoned Israeli and South Lebanon Army outposts. Here at Hule, one of the 12 villages that have fallen to Hizbullah in 24 hours, no one paid much attention when an Israeli outpost on a nearby hillside went up in smoke. They were too busy celebrat ing their sudden liberation. \"It is 18 years since I set foot here,\" Adel Taher said as he sipped coffee in the home of relatives who had stayed put throughout the occupation. He was one of thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands, who headed south as soon as they heard the glad tidings yesterday morning. Traffic jams formed on narrow roads which, until last night, had led through a dangerous no man's land. Along the route they were greeted by cheering crowds and doused with rose water. A few cars flew communist flags, others those of the Shi'ite party Amal, but for the overwhelming majority the only possible emblem was the clenched fist and Kalashnikov of Hizbullah. It was Hizbullah's day. It had always vowed to drive out the \"Zionist enemy\" defeated, and in its book that was exactly what it was doing. Israel's \"security zone\", established in 1978, was designed to put a buffer between Israel and Yasser Arafat's Palestinian guerrillas; since the 80s it has served the same purpose against the \"Islamic resistance\". The Israelis always said they would never abandon the zone without security arrangements negotiated with Lebanon, including a settlement for the SLA - its proxy army - or the force's integration into the Lebanese army. The zone is now falling apart. Its central sector disintegrated after its militiamen sought refuge in Israel or handed themselves over to Hizbullah or Lebanon's army. Its eastern and western sectors are cut off from each other. Overnight Hizbullah has won complete access to the Israeli frontier - Hule is barely a mile away from the border. From Aadise, which fell a few hours later, the guerrillas have direct line of sight to the northern town of Kiryat Shmona. Residents say that the Israelis had been surreptitiously thinning out some positions in recent weeks. This so demoralised their SLA allies that they deserted en masse, with barely of drop of blood being shed. At Hule, about 30 of them squatted in a darkened room. \"Our situation was becoming unbearable,\" said Muhammad Hamdan, a Shi'ite Muslim. He served seven years in the SLA, but only \"because I have a family of 10 to feed\". In all, Hizbullah says it has taken 150 prisoners in 24 hours. A hundred or more are reported to have surrendered to the Lebanese army at one of the former crossing points into Israeli-occupied Lebanon. \"We shall hand ours over to the Lebanese state,\" said a Hizbullah guard. But inside newly liberated Lebanon there is no Lebanese state to receive them. The regular army has not advanced from the edge of the zone. Nor have Unifil troops - the UN interim force in Lebanon - moved in to fill the vacuum. As the hordes descended on the south, Unifil checkpoints waved everyone through: the human tide was clearly too overwhelming to resist. For the foreseeable future only Hizbullah's writ will run here. This has alarmed Israel, and the deputy defence minister, Ephraim Sneh, warned that if Hizbullah moved into border villages Israel might have to return to Lebanon.",

But earlier yesterday a senior defence official in Tel Aviv admitted that Israel was advancing its self-imposed July 7 deadline for the exit by five weeks, and that the few hundred soldiers still in south Lebanon could leave any time after June 1.</p> <p>Israeli residents of the border area say they have seen signs that the last soldiers might be out of Lebanon even sooner. \"The full withdrawal will be sooner than you and I think - not in June but in the next few days,\" said Hanan Rubinski, secretary of Misgav Am kibbutz, which is on the border. With the SLA's flight from its outpost at Taibehon Sunday, the kibbutz is now just over a mile from Hizbullah's guns.</p> <p>In northern Galilee, tens of thousands of Israelis were ordered into underground shelters yesterday for fear of reprisal rocket attacks after three Lebanese civilians were killed by Israeli helicopter gunships. But many settlers simply drove south rather than spend the night in shelters.</p> <p>Mr Barak had badly wanted the UN to approve an expanded peacekeeping force to stabilise the south Lebanon situation, but that prospect appeared to be evaporating.</p> <p>Israel's SLA allies, who face execution or long prison sentences for collaborating with a foreign occupier, are streaming towards the border to seek refuge. Defence officials said four trucks and two jeeps carrying about 30 members of the SLA and their families had crossed at the Tourmos border post, and that they would be given asylum.</p> <p>Israeli army radio said another 100 Lebanese were asking to enter at the Biranit crossing in western Galilee. Journalists in the border town of Metullah said scores more were waiting on the Lebanese side and had reportedly been turned back.</p> <p>There are also fears of an exodus from northern Israel. Mr Rubinski said that with Israeli schools breaking up for the summer holidays soon, many northern families would see this as a good time to leave. \"If this tension keeps on in the days ahead, people will have to come to a decision,\" he said.</p> <p>In the past few days Mr Barak has tried to distract people in the north from the prospect that the withdrawal will lead to a rise in rocket attacks, and guerrilla infiltration. But the acceleration of events has undermined his efforts. Defence officials admitted yesterday that a sophisticated new fence to keep out guerrillas had yet to be completed, and that the army had yet to install promised anti-missile walls around the most exposed settlements.</p> <p>On a tour of northern communities yesterday Mr Barak warned that Israel would take harsh reprisals for any attack on its territory once the withdrawal was complete. \"The response will be very painful,\" he said. \"I don't recommend it to anyone in the area to provoke a response from Israel.\"</p>",

But earlier yesterday a senior defence official in Tel Aviv admitted that Israel was advancing its self-imposed July 7 deadline for the exit by five weeks, and that the few hundred soldiers still in south Lebanon could leave any time after June 1. Israeli residents of the border area say they have seen signs that the last soldiers might be out of Lebanon even sooner. \"The full withdrawal will be sooner than you and I think - not in June but in the next few days,\" said Hanan Rubinski, secretary of Misgav Am kibbutz, which is on the border. With the SLA's flight from its outpost at Taibehon Sunday, the kibbutz is now just over a mile from Hizbullah's guns. In northern Galilee, tens of thousands of Israelis were ordered into underground shelters yesterday for fear of reprisal rocket attacks after three Lebanese civilians were killed by Israeli helicopter gunships. But many settlers simply drove south rather than spend the night in shelters. Mr Barak had badly wanted the UN to approve an expanded peacekeeping force to stabilise the south Lebanon situation, but that prospect appeared to be evaporating. Israel's SLA allies, who face execution or long prison sentences for collaborating with a foreign occupier, are streaming towards the border to seek refuge. Defence officials said four trucks and two jeeps carrying about 30 members of the SLA and their families had crossed at the Tourmos border post, and that they would be given asylum. Israeli army radio said another 100 Lebanese were asking to enter at the Biranit crossing in western Galilee. Journalists in the border town of Metullah said scores more were waiting on the Lebanese side and had reportedly been turned back. There are also fears of an exodus from northern Israel. Mr Rubinski said that with Israeli schools breaking up for the summer holidays soon, many northern families would see this as a good time to leave. \"If this tension keeps on in the days ahead, people will have to come to a decision,\" he said. In the past few days Mr Barak has tried to distract people in the north from the prospect that the withdrawal will lead to a rise in rocket attacks, and guerrilla infiltration. But the acceleration of events has undermined his efforts. Defence officials admitted yesterday that a sophisticated new fence to keep out guerrillas had yet to be completed, and that the army had yet to install promised anti-missile walls around the most exposed settlements. On a tour of northern communities yesterday Mr Barak warned that Israel would take harsh reprisals for any attack on its territory once the withdrawal was complete. \"The response will be very painful,\" he said. \"I don't recommend it to anyone in the area to provoke a response from Israel.\"",

      "bodyText": "Labour has set up a Treasury- supported team of backbenchers to look for the financial black hole in the Conservatives' tax and spending plans. Labour hopes to use the same techniques deployed with devasting effect by successive Conservative governments - such as the \"double whammy\" campaign in the 1992 election campaign - to prove that the Tories' tax cuts and spending promises are profiligate and irresponsible. The group, led by backbencher Christopher Leslie, MP for Shipley, has been monitoring every statement from Conservative frontbench politicians, ranging from subsidies on pig offal to abolition of capital gains tax, to assemble a figure for the Tories' financial black hole which Labour predicts will exceed \u00a320bn. In a foretaste of the Labour attack in the run-up to the general election, the group hopes to substantiate the claim that William Hague has become a new breed of animal - a tax cut and spend politician. The group claims the Tories \"have yet to identify any credible specific savings whilst continuing to make a stream of unsustainable spending pledges and tax promises\". Downing Street believes the Conservatives are especially vulnerable because Mr Hague has committed himself to cutting tax as a proportion of national income over the next parliament, even though he has also promised to match Labour spending on health and education. The shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, has countered by claiming Gordon Brown, on page 200 of the Treasury red book, also commits himself to cut tax as a proportion of national income. So far, the Conservatives have claimed they can cut \u00a37bn from welfare spending and \u00a32bn from excessive central government spending. The work compiled by Mr Leslie - parliamentary private secretary to cabinet minister Lord Falconer - and his team suggests the \u00a37bn figure can only be reached if it includes all irregularities in the system, such as estimating the number of people who would miss one interview at a benefits office and lose state support. The Leslie team also says the Tory savings in the DSS budget include \"the complete nonsense\" of assuming that all lone parents whose youngest child is over 11 could immediately find work at high enough pay levels to exclude them from in-work benefits. Labour claims the \u00a32bn of excess spending on the cost of government is also a deeply suspect figure since it represents cash, rather than real terms. The costs of central gov ernment have not risen in real terms, Labour claims, and are falling in real terms from the levels inherited from the Toires. Other Tory spending commitments costed by the Leslie group include a right to transfer tax allowance (\u00a34.25bn), tax relief for private health insurance (\u00a3500m), abolition of capital gains tax (\u00a33.9bn), pledge to cut the top rate of tax (\u00a3690m), and scrapping of stamp duty on share sales (\u00a33.7bn). In addition Ann Widdecombe, shadow home secretary, has broadly costed her law and order package at \u00a3260m, including stiffer sentences and more prisons. She concedes this excludes the cost of her commitment to restore police numbers to the levels at the time of the last general election. This may require a big increase in police pay. Ms Widdecombe has also claimed her plan to put 100,000 asylum seeekers in detention centres will bring financial savings, since asylum seekers will be deterred from coming to Britain, although on other occasisons she has said it will take years to get rid of the backlog of asylum claims. Other Tory spending commitments include building 1,000 new parks and greens, restoring spending on road maintenance, and restoring tax concessions for the elderly who choose to have private healthcare. The shadow transport minister, Bernard Jenkin, has also said transport needs billions of pounds of investment, but has not specified whether this could be raised from the private sector.",

A member of a family with a bad cold who blew their nose and then turned on the tap could easily leave more than 1,000 viruses on the handle, many of which could be picked up by the next person who touched the tap. If that person then touched their mouth, nose or eye they stood a good chance of infection.</p> <p>Patricia Rusin, Charles Gerba and Sheri Maxwell at the University of Arizona, Tucson, looked at the degree of transfer of Serratia rubidea, a bacterium which causes diarrhoeal disease, and PRD-1, a bacterial virus similar to a human virus, from common household articles to the hand. Telephone re ceivers passed on 39% of the bacteria and 66% of the viruses, while taps passed on 28% and 34%.

      "bodyText": "Infectious diseases can be passed from one person to another by such simple actions as turning on a tap or picking up the telephone, according to new research. Scientists from Arizona said yesterday that viruses could linger for days on hard surfaces, while the dose needed to cause an infection was low. A member of a family with a bad cold who blew their nose and then turned on the tap could easily leave more than 1,000 viruses on the handle, many of which could be picked up by the next person who touched the tap. If that person then touched their mouth, nose or eye they stood a good chance of infection. Patricia Rusin, Charles Gerba and Sheri Maxwell at the University of Arizona, Tucson, looked at the degree of transfer of Serratia rubidea, a bacterium which causes diarrhoeal disease, and PRD-1, a bacterial virus similar to a human virus, from common household articles to the hand. Telephone re ceivers passed on 39% of the bacteria and 66% of the viruses, while taps passed on 28% and 34%. Further studies showed that 34% of the bacteria and viruses could be transferred to the lower lip if it was touched by an infected finger. These results were coupled with published information regarding the infective dose (the number of microbes required to cause an infection) and levels of disease-causing microbes called pathogens found in human fluids such as stool and nasal secretions. Reporting their results to a conference of the American Society for Microbiology, they described several infection scenarios. There were large numbers of salmonella, a common bacterial cause of diarrhoea, in the stool of an infected person. If only a tiny amount of stool were transferred from a contaminated hand to a telephone receiver, the next user could have 107,104 salmonella cells on the fingertip. If that finger were placed in the mouth, they calculate, the person would receive a dose of 36,383 cells, which could easily result in disease. If a telephone receiver were contaminated with a low concentration of rotavirus agent - they suggest 10,000 viruses - then 6,580 of these would be transferred to the hand during normal use of the phone, with 211 of them found on the fingertip. \"Our results show that 72 viruses could be ingested by the user, which would very likely result in disease.\" In previous work they showed that the household sponge might contain 320m disease causing germs.

Politically, it has been a headache: with defeats in local elections, a slide in the opinion polls and two enormous industrial closures all serving to strip the prime minister of his aura of invincibility. Looking back, it is clear when the trouble began. The very moment the clock struck twelve to herald the new millennium, things turned ugly.</p> <p>The next day's papers did not sing a song of jubilee - instead they rubbished what was meant to be the symbol of the Blairite new Britain: the Millennium Dome. There had been a monumental cock-up on the opening night, as the London elite were kept waiting for hours. In a way, the dome never recovered from that first blast of negative publicity. The word of mouth kicked in immediately: the Dome was a turkey.</p> <p>Despite management changes, multiple relaunches and discounts for latecomers, the Greenwich fun-palace has simply failed to draw the crowds it needed. Half a million have been coming in each of the most recent months, but it is not enough: the Dome needed to bring in twice that number. Now it has revised down its estimates, from the initial 12m visitors expected throughout the year to the 7m hoped for today. If this was the private sector, the plug would probably have been pulled by now.</p> <p>But this is not the private sector and some very big political egos are on the line. The PM invested personal capital in this project (remember the photos of Mr Blair in a yellow hard-hat?): he could not let it die a failure. And so yesterday the Millennium Commission did its duty. Mo Mowlam doubtless acted for her boss in voting to give this apparent turkey a blood transfusion of \u00a329m. The commission insisted on tying the new cash to yet more improvements in the New Millennium Experience - but, tellingly, it did not rule out doling out even more money later on. That brings to \u00a3538m the total amount of lottery money the Dome has sucked up: \u00a360m of it in another emergency hand-out in January.</p> <p>Was this a good decision? It has only one thing to commend it: now the Dome will have a chance to prove itself in the one period when it might score - the school summer holidays. Otherwise it looks like bad politics and bad economics. After all, this is a government which has made a sacred principle of minimal intervention to help ailing industries. Dagenham and Longbridge were struggling, too; but Labour made it clear that financial hand-outs to keep those factories alive were off the table. Suddenly that iron law is waived for the Dome.</p> <p>It is bad politics because it makes Labour's priorities appear out of kilter: help will not come for manufacturing industry, but it will for what is fast looking like a vanity project in the south-east of England. Yesterday's decision also risks hurting, albeit indirectly, the much more popular New Opportunities Fund - which organises small-scale projects: after-school activities, nature walks and help for the countryside. They were due to get Millennium Commission money next year: now they risk getting less - or at the very least a long wait for it.</p> <p>This newspaper supported the idea of a grand British project to see in the millennium. We even liked the notion of a big Dome. But like many others we wanted something of real, enduring value to go inside it. That did not come. Now the best course is probably an early sell-off to someone else who might do a better job - and a serious attempt to learn some lessons from what has been a shambolic, disappointing experience.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Despite the arrival of little Leo, 2000 has not been a banner year in the life of Tony Blair. Politically, it has been a headache: with defeats in local elections, a slide in the opinion polls and two enormous industrial closures all serving to strip the prime minister of his aura of invincibility. Looking back, it is clear when the trouble began. The very moment the clock struck twelve to herald the new millennium, things turned ugly. The next day's papers did not sing a song of jubilee - instead they rubbished what was meant to be the symbol of the Blairite new Britain: the Millennium Dome. There had been a monumental cock-up on the opening night, as the London elite were kept waiting for hours. In a way, the dome never recovered from that first blast of negative publicity. The word of mouth kicked in immediately: the Dome was a turkey. Despite management changes, multiple relaunches and discounts for latecomers, the Greenwich fun-palace has simply failed to draw the crowds it needed. Half a million have been coming in each of the most recent months, but it is not enough: the Dome needed to bring in twice that number. Now it has revised down its estimates, from the initial 12m visitors expected throughout the year to the 7m hoped for today. If this was the private sector, the plug would probably have been pulled by now. But this is not the private sector and some very big political egos are on the line. The PM invested personal capital in this project (remember the photos of Mr Blair in a yellow hard-hat?): he could not let it die a failure. And so yesterday the Millennium Commission did its duty. Mo Mowlam doubtless acted for her boss in voting to give this apparent turkey a blood transfusion of \u00a329m. The commission insisted on tying the new cash to yet more improvements in the New Millennium Experience - but, tellingly, it did not rule out doling out even more money later on. That brings to \u00a3538m the total amount of lottery money the Dome has sucked up: \u00a360m of it in another emergency hand-out in January. Was this a good decision? It has only one thing to commend it: now the Dome will have a chance to prove itself in the one period when it might score - the school summer holidays. Otherwise it looks like bad politics and bad economics. After all, this is a government which has made a sacred principle of minimal intervention to help ailing industries. Dagenham and Longbridge were struggling, too; but Labour made it clear that financial hand-outs to keep those factories alive were off the table. Suddenly that iron law is waived for the Dome. It is bad politics because it makes Labour's priorities appear out of kilter: help will not come for manufacturing industry, but it will for what is fast looking like a vanity project in the south-east of England. Yesterday's decision also risks hurting, albeit indirectly, the much more popular New Opportunities Fund - which organises small-scale projects: after-school activities, nature walks and help for the countryside. They were due to get Millennium Commission money next year: now they risk getting less - or at the very least a long wait for it. This newspaper supported the idea of a grand British project to see in the millennium. We even liked the notion of a big Dome. But like many others we wanted something of real, enduring value to go inside it. That did not come. Now the best course is probably an early sell-off to someone else who might do a better job - and a serious attempt to learn some lessons from what has been a shambolic, disappointing experience.",

Where Laurent Perrier had produced a spiral labyrinth in celebration of a 17th century French natural philosopher and Shaikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan had commissioned a cool \"garden of the night\" in dark marble, the Leyhill open prisoners of Gloucestershire had recreated a derelict family coal mine in the Forest of Dean and planted it out with just about every rampant English weed and bits of old junk. It struck a chord with Peter, a carpenter laying acres of decking nearby. \"That's what I call a garden. Nice stinging nettles. Reminds me of home.\" Elsewhere, between giant orchids, the first Jill Dando roses, armies of military style tulips and and forests of bonsai, Commonwealth countries were exhibiting the sort of hallucinogenic sub-tropical flowers which global warming might one day allow to be grown in Britain. Not to be outdone by the Caribbean, South African or Australian exhibits, a US botanical garden had air-freighted in a quarter of an acre of tropical rainforest, complete with acrylic waterfalls but minus ants and wildlife. But Barbados won the unofficial vote of passers-by with a selection of demented-looking scarlet asparagus plants, surreal heliconia rostratyas and nature's equivalent of the late Dame Barbara Cartland - an outrageously vivid curcuma plant. \"It's all very exciting,\" said Lady Arabella Lennox-Boyd, who has designed a garden of olive trees, sculptures and canals. \"People have much more money and courage today. Gardening used to be exclusive. Everyone's experimenting now. \" Gardening is now an \u00a311bn a year industry, one of the most popular and fast growing leisure sectors and the prices of everything from conservatories to pergolas have rocketed. Getting in on the boom times are artists and sculptors with painted Italian stone and effigies of animals and children. \"I am appalled at some of the quality here,\" said Alan Wilson, who was selling limited edition otters for \u00a31,250 and men with their private parts covered by lizards for \u00a320,000, and inscriptions in Latin. \"It is easy to get out a credit card and put a deposit on a weasel if the mortgage is paid, the kids have left, you have got the yacht.\" \"This year, it is all water and reflections, hi tech and the millennium,\" says designer Geoff Whitten whose marsh garden looks back to the days when you could pick up an old ruin for a few hundred pounds. Now, made in false stone but muddied with real dirty water, his ruined cottage with a half-sunk boat has a reserve price of \u00a340,000.",

Jean Fautrier's Head of a Hostage, 1943-44, is a strange, molten, gobbetty lump of glistening lead, sheared by a piece of slate, which provides the central axis, the vertical of the nose, the sole division of the face. The piece of slate appears to have healed over. It gives Fautrier's head a kind of keel. It gives this near-formless lump its balance and its anonymous human presence. </p> <p>There are several versions of this work. Another - perhaps a cast taken from this version (the form is reversed) - is a virulent green patinated bronze, and when I first saw it I thought of Ariel's song from the Tempest, hence the image of the sea, and thought of drowning. It is a drowned face, a head without eyes. When I look at it I think of how heavy one's own head feels in the moment before sleep. Walk around this leaden head, and the profile emerges, the keel of the face again, or perhaps its prow, cleaving the air. Seen front on, the head looks asphyxiated. </p> <p>Fautrier, born in 1898, was bought up in England by his mother, was gassed at the end of the first world war, and detained by the SS in the Occupation in Paris in 1942. I think he made this work just after he left a sanitorium in Chamonix, in 1943. At about this time he also illustrated Georges Bataille's Madame Edwarda. Bataille talked of the formless as like spit. The lead of Fautrier's head is like spit too, solidified. </p> <p>The other head by Fautrier in the room, the Grand Tragic Head from 1942, is more pained, one side of the face clawed flat, the other misshapen but alert. But the leaden lump is so much better - or worse. Like Medardo Rosso's heads, it is stuck between emergence and submergence, affectiveness and disappearance.

I enjoy its collisions and its disasters, the daftness of it, even the pervasive mediocrity. Painted plants in the potting shed, sunsets over the Venice Lagoon, nice views of even nicer places - why not, I ask. Girl on a Shady Terrace? Beehives and a Yellow Cat Set Among the Lavender, Provence? Often, the title is enough. Actually seeing the work is somehow superfluous. You can construct entire holidays and meals from the titles - Red Leicester and Pickled Onions; Granny Smith and Knife; Redcurrants. And you can be sure that there will be a picture of Ken Livingstone here somewhere, among the Morrises and Vanessas. There is. </p> <p>You know things are getting a bit more serious when titles like Obelisk Drift, Encounter, Divided #84 and Circle Series (Interaction) start coming along - this, assuredly, is the kind of modern art that deserves a twangy counterpoint of 50s musique concrete and a voice-over explaining the crisis of the modern condition. I much prefer Adrian Berg's flaring, unchanging painted gardens; Norman \"Knackers\" Ackroyd's tenebrous etchings, Anthony Green's enthusiasm, and his wonky depictions of his life, or Freddie Gore's unexpected annual wildness. The novelty sculptures and Sunday conceptualist gags always take the biscuit - surely they are here only to remind us that every bad idea can have a good day, that for every vanguard, there has to be a rearguard. And when all else fails there's always Eduardo Paolozzi and Howard Hodgkin. </p> <p>It is somehow warming to discover that there are still artists who pop in on Varnishing Day to do a spot of varnishing, or to craftily touch in an extra bit of colour, setting their works off against their accidental neighbours. Another bit of me takes perverse delight in the invariable awfulness, the one-upmanship, the hubris, the low horizon of it all. As works are numbered rather than labelled, one is constantly wrong-footed: gosh, look at that fake Anselm Keifer, you say, but then turn to the catalogue and see that these pastiches of German heavyweights like Keifer and Baselitz really are by the men themselves, conned into becoming honorary RAs. Cy Twombly sends in a scribbled note every year, and that weedy homage to Balthus - nude floppy-limbed girl on bed in languorous crumbly yellowing afternoon light - really is a Balthus. </p> <p>It is when the exhibition tries too hard to be hip and with-it that things go wrong. Lewis Biggs, director of Tate Liverpool, and one of the judges of this year's Wollaston Award - a prize of \u00a325,000 for the \"most distinguished work\" in the exhibition - raves about being \"knocked out\" by the standard and variety, and asks, \"What other exhibition this year will combine the most cutting-edge, conceptual work with the utterly accessible?\" I am afraid that the dread cliche \"cutting-edge\" signals that the man has been driven to desperation. </p> <p>We might like to see the summer exhibition as the ultimate in radical pluralism, but somehow it never feels like that. Admittedly, the shortlist of artists selected for the Wollaston Award is a bit mind-boggling, going as it does from a small screenprint by Basil Beattie to a gargantuan hi-tech acrylic painting by Frank Stella, Hon RA, but it is a meaningless roll call. Gerard Hemsworth is on the shortlist with a painting of a rabbit, in schematic outline, that failed to win any kind of prize in last year's John Moores exhibition. My favourite contender is Georgia Hayes's Birds in the British Museum, a picture of two mangled mallards done in a style reminiscent of New York painter Donald Baechler: he used to get Bowery drunks and guys in prison to make drawings for him, which he then enlarged, very roughly, on big, dirty canvases. Hayes renders her touchingly pathetic ducks in overcooked, jaunty oil paint. It is still funny though. The ducks are definitely challenged by something or other. </p> <p>Frank Stella gets an entire room to himself, which, at the end of last week, was crammed with two vast paintings and two huge scrap-metal sculptures. Apparently, a third sculpture is yet to be added. Born in 1936, Stella's career has run backwards - in that the work he made in his 20s was his best. For the past 30 years, things have gone steadily downhill for Stella. His severe, sober early works gave way to lunking drivel, neo-baroque arrangements of French curves, and now layered patches of fluorescent spray , spirals, computer-generated lattices, blats, staves and writhing forms derived from the shapes cigar smoke makes when photographed in a glass box. The sculptures, like the paintings, are big, cumbersome, overcomplicated grungy hulks. </p> <p>There is something ogre-ish, maniacal and desperate about Stella's room at the Academy, but it hardly matters, as the summer exhibition is so utterly strange. Tony Cragg - himself an RA - has tried to make the room for which he was responsible look cool and sparse, with works by Richard Deacon, Cragg himself, Barry Flanagan and - another Wollaston Award contender - Brian McCann. Peter Blake, on the other hand, has made a sort of spoof Academy hang in an adjacent gallery, lining the walls with hundreds of smallish works. Some of these are so pointedly bad, that it is quite clear the gallery is more about Blake himself than the exhibits he has chosen to include. Stella's is one kind of insufferable egoism, Blake's another. </p> <p>The new president of the RA, Phillip King, is, like Cragg and new recruit William Tucker, a sculptor. He is also having to come to grips with the politics of an institution that has been far too clubbable for far too long. Some Royal Academicians are barely worth the letters after their name, and many of those who resigned over the inclusion of Marcus Harvey's portrait of Myra Hindley, in the Sensation show in 1997, are, I notice, sloping back. But do we really want a more relevant academy? Do we care? </p> <p>The Academy is weird, and there's nothing weirder than the summer exhibition. It would be terrible if the RA turned itself into a replicant of all the other contemporary galleries and art spaces in London, lauding the same artists, vaunting the same dubious pantheon. I, for one, don't mind a bit of old-fashioned aesthetic conservatism - and where, in current art-speak, would the cutting edge be without the existence of a rearguard? Whence challenge without old-style values? But no one really believes all this. The whole thing is a charade. With the appointment of Phillip King and mutterings abroad, it appears that there is an attempt to re-jig the summer show for once and for all, and to entice our better younger artists into the fold. This may be the last time to see the summer exhibition in its present form. But then they always say that, and it always stays more or less the same. </p> <p>\u0095 The summer exhibition opens at the Royal Academy, London W1, on Monday. Details: 020-7300 8000.</p>",

John Bissett Hebburn, Tyne &amp; Wear johnbissett@cableinet.co.uk \u0095 Glad to see you didn't go over the top this morning with the neonatal Blair - just the front page, an editorial and G2 showed remarkable restraint. I suppose a pull-out, all-colour christening edition is out of the question? Dr Robert Court Weston-super-Mare, Somerset court@hemscott.net \u0095 Did Tony and Cherie pick the name Leo for the reasons we did? Leo McGree was a distinguished post-war communist and labour leader; Leo(pold) Bloom the literary hero of the 20th century in Joyce's Ulysses; and Leo McKern the best character in the 60s TV series The Prisoner. Great choice. Natalie Seeve-McKenna Liverpool nataliem@liverpool.ac.uk \u0095 It is a shame the baby was not called Eric as a tribute to the author who epitomised true socialist ideals. Daniel Colover London \u0095 Shouldn't the baby have been called Lionel? I suppose one all-singing, all dancing male in the family is enough. Mark Walker London \u0095 My children are very impressed that the Blairs have named their new son after the Red Power Ranger. Anne Salter Balquhidder, Perthshire Anne@geomantics.com \u0095 Leo should have no problem attending prime minister's questions... after all, no unseemly breast-feeding. Sue Negri Norwich sue.negri.socs@norfolk.gov.uk \u0095 Surely Taurus? But then Taury Blair wouldn't have sounded quite right, would it? Mike Atkinson Nottingham \u0095 Leo Blair is an anagram of I bore all. Peter Barnes Milton Keynes, Bucks",

Ten years ago, when you were well over 80, we were in Tuscany and you were playing the disreputable, lecherous old journalist who insists on going on a summer holiday in order to embarrass his family, in a filmed version of Summer's Lease. You went home, had a small operation and came back a week later still chain-smoking, gossiping, talking endlessly, acting with a faultless touch, as though there had been no interruption.</p> <p>I remember a long night shoot with you talking in a dark garden. We got on to your great comic creation, John Worthing and your memory of Bosie. \"Lord Alfred Douglas was a beautiful young man who ended up sour and ugly. Can you believe this? He was at the first 'The Importance' and he couldn't remember whether it was played as farce or comedy. He was Wilde's closest friend and he couldn't remember a single thing about the production.\"</p> <p>I suppose I was not much more than 10 when I saw your first Hamlet, an intelligent, witty, sensitive and poetic prince, for me the Hamlet of all time. \"I played other characters,\" you said, \"but I always thought of Hamlet as me.\" I can still see you as Richard of Bordeaux, a spoiled king, bathed in a golden light. I wrote for a signed photograph of you wearing a trilby hat and the star of the Good Companions. I never dreamed that I'd grow up to sit with you in the canteen of Thames Television and have you tell me that you learned more from your failures than your successes. When you were at the Old Vic, playing all the great roles in your youth, James Agate came round to congratulate you in the interval on Macbeth because, he said, \"I might have changed my mind by the end of the play\". As you talked your hands moved to the rhythm of your speech. \"Ken Tynan said I only had two gestures, the left hand up, the right hand up - what does he want me to do? Bring out my prick?\"</p> <p>The pre-war theatre was dominated by two great stars. You and Olivier. You were the master of the poetry, easily moving the audience because you were so effortlessly in tears yourself. You told me that your mother cried \"almost constantly like a wet April\". Olivier, with the clipped delivery, was the physical actor, dropping from a great height to kill Claudius and rolling down a long staircase as Coriolanus. The rivalry became a collaboration when you and Olivier alternated as Romeo and Mercutio in an unforgettable production.</p> <p>Shakespeare hadn't been played in the West End since the days of Irving and Tree, but you made him a box office hit on Shaftesbury Avenue and then, in the 50s, the theatre changed, Look Back In Anger came to the Court and poetry seemed to be no longer wanted. Luckily, it was Tony Richardson, also from the Court, who cast you as Lord Raglan in the Charge of the Light Brigade and a great player of film comedy was revealed.</p> <p>You said that you had three besetting sins, on and off the stage, impetuosity, self-consciousness and \"a lack of interest in anything not immediately connected with myself or the theatre\". This lack of interest extended to horses. You played the King of France on horseback during the filming of Becket. The director told you to say the line and the horse would move one pace forward. At the first take you said the line, of course impeccably, but the horse remained immobile. By the seventh take the horse had still not moved on cue, or at all. Then, extremely puzzled, you asked the director: \"Do you think the animal knows?\"</p> <p>It was true that you took a somewhat vague view of matters not connected with yourself or the theatre. One night in wartime you were seen to look sadly up at the barrage balloons which protected London and said: \"I do feel so sorry for our poor boys up there. They must be terribly lonely.\" I remember a dinner long ago at Tony Richardson's house. My actress daughter Emily was a baby then, and we had brought her with us in a carrycot and left her in a spare bedroom. We were lugging this pink plastic box out of the front door when you saw us and said: \"Why on earth didn't you leave your child at home? Are you afraid of burglars?\"</p> <p>You were also, of course, the most famous brick dropper of all time. Having directed Richard Burton in Hamlet, you went into his dressing room meaning to say, \"We'll go to dinner when you are ready\" but your critical subconscious made you come out with, \"We'll go to dinner when you're better\". Your classic dropped brick came when you were having lunch in the old Ivy with a pre-war playwright whose name, curiously enough, was Edward Knoblock.</p> <p>A man came in at the door and waved to you and Knoblock asked you who he was. \"That,\" you said with great confidence, \"is the second most boring man in London.\" \"So who's the first most boring man in London?\" the playwright asked, to which you unhesitatingly replied, \"Edward Knoblock, of course\". And then, realising you had said exactly the right thing, you tried to mend matters by adding, \"Not you, of course, I mean the other Edward Knoblock\".</p> <p>Apart from Summer's Lease you did a radio play of mine and you were unforgettable as Charles Ryder's father in a television adaptation I did of Brideshead Revisited. The scene in which, with barely concealed malice, you mock your son's unwelcome need of money must rank among the great comic performances of all time. You had that essential quality of all comedy performers. The scene must always be played absolutely seriously, and the actor must never think he is being funny.</p> <p>So I have been extraordinarily lucky. You introduced me to Shakespeare on the stage, and you said lines I have written. More than that you were, as everyone who knew you or worked with you can testify, an inspiration to all of us and a constant, unexpected, unpredictable joy to be with. I suppose we must accept the idea that you are not immortal, but irreplaceable you most certainly are.</p>",

That is to say some 70% of them did not turn out for a referendum on replacing proportional representation with first past the post and the vote was therefore invalidated. There are reasons for apathy. Sunday was a rerun of last year's failed referendum and people tire. The Italian economy is looking up at last, which might have encouraged complacency about the political system. Alternatively, abstention was a way of endorsing the prospect of the right wing coming to power for the first time since 1994. Silvio Berlusconi told his supporters not to bother and a lot of other Italians seem to have joined them.</p> <p>Even so it is a deplorable result (which, incidentally, has few implications for the UK case for election reform).

      "bodyText": "Once again, the Italians have endorsed the way they are governed despite its manifest failings. That is to say some 70% of them did not turn out for a referendum on replacing proportional representation with first past the post and the vote was therefore invalidated. There are reasons for apathy. Sunday was a rerun of last year's failed referendum and people tire. The Italian economy is looking up at last, which might have encouraged complacency about the political system. Alternatively, abstention was a way of endorsing the prospect of the right wing coming to power for the first time since 1994. Silvio Berlusconi told his supporters not to bother and a lot of other Italians seem to have joined them. Even so it is a deplorable result (which, incidentally, has few implications for the UK case for election reform). Under the system voters failed to change, Mr Berlusconi is likely to take power, but dependent on neo-fascists and northern separatists. They might push him into an even more extreme position on entry into Italy, where he has talked about firing on vessels in the Adriatic on suspicion of their carrying refugees and immigrants.

      "bodyText": "The US supreme court has decided by a narrow margin that congress went too far when it acted to restrict sex-oriented programming on cable television. The court's ruling is certain to revive the debate about broadcasting explicit sex scenes and discussions on television, a potent issue in an election year. It stems from complaints by Playboy Television, part of Hugh Hefner's resurgent Playboy empire, that government action has inhibited the rights of broadcasters enshrined in the first amendment, part of which guarantees free speech. By a majority of 5-4, the court ruled yesterday that the government had not explored every alternative course of action available to it when it imposed the law restricting sex shows on cable television, as allowed by the Communications Decency Act of 1996. \"If television broadcasts can expose children to the real risk of harmful exposure to indecent materials even in their own home and without parental consent, there is a problem the government can address,\" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in his summary of the judgement. However the government decided to deal with the problem, \"it must do so in a way consistent with first-amendment principles,\" he continued. The court concluded: \"Here, the government has not met the burden the first amendment imposes.\" The court upheld a lower court's decision that the government had options other than imposing the restrictions available to it. The ruling throws back on the government the burden of coming up with a way of controlling the output of cable channels, which have been showing increasingly explicit sex programmes. The 1996 decency act, introduced after complaints from church groups and conservative family lobbies, restricts sex-oriented channels to operating at night unless they \"scramble\" their signal, making it impossible for anyone but a subscriber to receive what they offer. There had been complaints that even when the signal was scrambled adults and children could still hear the sex channel. Cable channel operators object to the night-time restriction because they know that many of their potential audience are likely to watch during the day and the restrictions have meant a loss of advertising revenue. Sex-oriented programming on cable television is now worth many millions of dollars a year and programme-makers have made it clear that they will fight any attempts to slow down its growth. The subject of sex on television has become a big election-year issue. Candidates have to tread the line between appearing to condone sexually explicit programming and being labelled as opposed to free speech. While cable channels such as Bravo delete even common swear-words - all were removed from a showing of of Mike Leigh's Secrets and Lies last weekend- others have pushed the medium to its limits, showing explicit material. The shock radio jockey and television personality Howard Stern is currently running a parody of Who Wants to be a Millionaire? in which scantily clad women compete to win new body parts for themselves. The explosion of such programmes has led conservative groups to organise boycotts of advertisers associated with lewd programming.",

Typically, the bidders gather in motorway lay-bys or service station carparks. The business is unchallenged, since the Italian mafia melted away in the face of the Balkan onslaught.

Others have told their families that they are waitresses or dancers, and fear blackmail.</p> <p>Jailed pimps have been known, upon release, to track down the girl who betrayed them. \"These men are extremely violent, and they keep discipline by making examples of those who step out of line,\" says Ms Lani. Virtually every week two-paragraph stories in Italian newspapers report the discovery of a streetwalker's corpse, often burned.

      "body": "<p>Today, children are more likely to study the techniques behind mass biscuit production than roll up their sleeves and make them. Concerned about the long-term effects of children no longer being taught how to prepare food, the Royal Society of Arts launched its Focus on Food campaign specifically to raise the profile of hands-on cookery. That was three years ago; now it has two thousand schools taking part. The independent and state sector primary and secondary schools are involved. </p> <p>As its director Anita Cormac explains: \"It is like training to be a doctor but never seeing a patient. How can youngsters learn about food and healthy eating if they are not shown how to prepare food? If you can't cook, you are putting your nutrition in the hands of the manufacturers of ready meals. We need to engage our young people in a culinary culture and show them that cooking is fun.\" </p> <p>Few schools can afford the expensive teaching facilities and extended kitchens necessary to teach practical cookery. So the RSA's Focus on Food campaign takes the kitchen out to them. </p> <p>Its Cooking Bus - a \"culinary pantechnicon\" housing a state-of-the-art kitchen and classroom area - has visited nearly 200 schools in Britain.

      "bodyText": "Today, children are more likely to study the techniques behind mass biscuit production than roll up their sleeves and make them. Concerned about the long-term effects of children no longer being taught how to prepare food, the Royal Society of Arts launched its Focus on Food campaign specifically to raise the profile of hands-on cookery. That was three years ago; now it has two thousand schools taking part. The independent and state sector primary and secondary schools are involved. As its director Anita Cormac explains: \"It is like training to be a doctor but never seeing a patient. How can youngsters learn about food and healthy eating if they are not shown how to prepare food? If you can't cook, you are putting your nutrition in the hands of the manufacturers of ready meals. We need to engage our young people in a culinary culture and show them that cooking is fun.\" Few schools can afford the expensive teaching facilities and extended kitchens necessary to teach practical cookery. So the RSA's Focus on Food campaign takes the kitchen out to them. Its Cooking Bus - a \"culinary pantechnicon\" housing a state-of-the-art kitchen and classroom area - has visited nearly 200 schools in Britain. It provides practical food teaching for thousands of pupils and training for teachers. Fresh ingredients are provided by the supermarket chain Waitrose, which is putting millions of pounds into the campaign. The RSA can call upon the free services of a line-up of celebrity chefs to teach. Last week Anthony Worral-Thompson helped out, and other regular participants include Sophie Grigson and Rick Stein. Schools receive materials to support their teaching, which this year focuses on the variety and qualities of food eaten in Britain today.

      "byline": "Interview by Amanda Roper",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>My son has been revising methodically </strong>for his GCSEs since before Easter. He's made a revision timetable and copious notes for the eight subjects he's studying, but he's now overwhelmed by the prospect of trying to take it all in. How can I help him to make the revision process more effective?</p> <p><strong>Jane Florsham </strong>was a senior teacher, and now works as an educational consultant. </p> <p>Your son needs to distil the information he has learned into more manageable chunks. He needs to go through his notes and reduce them into topic areas, and then key notes. These form the \"pegs\" on which you can hang your wider knowledge. Working out how to remember these depends upon what type of learner you are: visual, auditory or kinesthetic. </p> <p>Visual learners use flowcharts, spidergrams, charts or mnemonics. These take a large quantity of information and then present it in a simplified, but memorable, form. Put them up on the walls in your bedroom to memorise them. </p> <p>There are revision aides on tape/CD-Rom for auditory learners, but it's also worth making your own. As well as listening to it, the process of selecting the narrative for your revision tape will help to fix ideas into your subconscious. </p> <p>Kinesthetic learners learn best by doing. The very act of writing down revision notes is a form of active learning, as is watching videos. The BBC broadcasts the Bitesize revision series, which is extremely useful regardless of which form of learning suits you.

      "bodyText": "My son has been revising methodically for his GCSEs since before Easter. He's made a revision timetable and copious notes for the eight subjects he's studying, but he's now overwhelmed by the prospect of trying to take it all in. How can I help him to make the revision process more effective? Jane Florsham was a senior teacher, and now works as an educational consultant. Your son needs to distil the information he has learned into more manageable chunks. He needs to go through his notes and reduce them into topic areas, and then key notes. These form the \"pegs\" on which you can hang your wider knowledge. Working out how to remember these depends upon what type of learner you are: visual, auditory or kinesthetic. Visual learners use flowcharts, spidergrams, charts or mnemonics. These take a large quantity of information and then present it in a simplified, but memorable, form. Put them up on the walls in your bedroom to memorise them. There are revision aides on tape/CD-Rom for auditory learners, but it's also worth making your own. As well as listening to it, the process of selecting the narrative for your revision tape will help to fix ideas into your subconscious. Kinesthetic learners learn best by doing. The very act of writing down revision notes is a form of active learning, as is watching videos. The BBC broadcasts the Bitesize revision series, which is extremely useful regardless of which form of learning suits you. It's produced with GCSE revision in mind, and gives a great deal of visual stimulus that will help to trigger remembered learning. The same is true of using computer software, such as CD-Roms or internet revision sites, such as the Guardian's own website, www.learn.co.uk .

The government is eager to help and is spending billions developing better childcare across the country. However, some people worry that thousands of families may continue to miss out despite the politicians' promises. </p> <p> <strong> Why is childcare in the news now?</strong> </p> <p> This week is National Childcare Week. By coincidence, the prime minister's wife, Cherie, has just given birth to her fourth baby. People wonder if Mr Blair will take time off from his job to help look after baby Leo. </p> <p> <strong> What sorts of childcare can parents choose?</strong> </p> <p> First, you can care for your children at home. If a mother is working, the law allows her 18 weeks off work directly before and after her baby's birth. But in some countries, such as Sweden, both mothers and fathers are allowed to take time off for longer than 18 weeks. </p> <p>In Britain, fathers do not have a legal right to take paternity leave, although some employers allow them time off. If parents want to return to work, they may be able to get family members to help out or pay for a nanny or an au pair. </p> <p>Second, children too young to go to school may be cared for outside their home while their parents work. They might go to the home of an officially checked (registered) childminder, or attend a playgroup or a nursery paid for and/or run by other parents. Children can also attend after-school clubs and holiday playschemes. All of these have to be paid for by parents. Paying for a place at a private nursery can be very expensive. </p> <p>Third, there are nursery classes that are based at school though they are only for two and a half hours in the morning and the same in the afternoon. Often, more children want to attend a nursery than there are places. </p> <p> <strong> How can you tell if childcare is good?</strong> </p> <p> Babies, toddlers and school-age children all need different types of care. To check if someone is offering good childcare, a parent needs to find out if the care meets all a child's needs. This is important - over half a child's physical and mental development takes place before he or she is five years old. Children who get good nursery education tend to do well at school later. </p> <p> <strong> Why is the government so worried about childcare?</strong> </p> <p> Families now depend far more on official forms of childcare. Many family members live a long way away from each other. In the past, families often lived in the same town and cared for children of working relatives. </p> <p>The government also fears that if it does not provide affordable childcare, the children of poorer, working parents will be left to come home to an empty house after school and may get into trouble. </p> <p>The National Daycare Trust explains as many as 600,000 children under three live in poverty in Britain. Giving parents access to better-paid work is a major way to improve a family's fortunes. However, without good childcare many adults do not have the time or the money to train for a better job or to take up a job at all. </p> <p> <strong> What is the government trying to do?</strong> </p> <p> It is developing the National Childcare Strategy to increase the availability of high quality, affordable childcare. Its Sure Start scheme aims to create well-organised childcare in some of our poorest areas. It is also allowing some parents to pay less tax so that they can afford to pay for childcare. </p> <p> <strong> What problems remain?</strong> </p> <p> Many of the poorest families live in areas not covered by the Sure Start scheme. The situation is improving but it has a long way to go. </p> <p><strong> Further information: </strong>This week the <a href=\"http://www.daycaretrust.org.uk\">National Day Care Trust</a> (tel 020-77392866 is launching a guide to surviving half term.

The National Daycare Trust explains as many as 600,000 children under three live in poverty in Britain. Giving parents access to better-paid work is a major way to improve a family's fortunes. However, without good childcare many adults do not have the time or the money to train for a better job or to take up a job at all. What is the government trying to do? It is developing the National Childcare Strategy to increase the availability of high quality, affordable childcare. Its Sure Start scheme aims to create well-organised childcare in some of our poorest areas. It is also allowing some parents to pay less tax so that they can afford to pay for childcare. What problems remain? Many of the poorest families live in areas not covered by the Sure Start scheme. The situation is improving but it has a long way to go. Further information: This week the National Day Care Trust (tel 020-77392866 is launching a guide to surviving half term. See also Maternity Alliance factsheets on key childcare issues (please send \u00a31 and an A4 stamped addressed envelope to the Maternity Alliance, 45 Beech Street, London EC2P 2LX). \u0095 First Edition is a current affairs series for schools on C4 presented this week by Jon Snow and produced in association with Guardian Education.

      "bodyText": "Are all the violent tantrums of chefs, familiar from fly-on the-wall telly, putting youngsters off catering? This is one explanation for a serious, not to say slightly mysterious shortfall of applicants to one of the UK's top training programmes. This autumn's intake to the specialised chefs course at Bournemouth and Poole College of Further Education, which trains professional cooks for Britain's leading hotels and restaurants, is 15 trainees short. The programme which can take up to 30 students has only managed to attract 15 would-be trainees to date. Last year the programme started with 28 students. David Boland, the course's tutor, believes that there may be several reasons for the shortfall of applicants. He says that the number of 16-year-olds leaving school this year is lower than it has been for some years, so fewer young people are entering further education college courses generally. More worringly, however, he believes that young people are no longer prepared to work the long hours with no overtime that the catering industry has traditionally expected of its kitchen staff. And, while much of the media coverage of cooking and chefs in recent years has been favourable, some TV programmes showing chefs bullying and threatening kitchen staff will not have encouraged young people to opt for a life in the kitchen. The Bournemouth and Poole course, which has been running since 1989, trains chefs for leading hotels and restaurants, such as the Savoy, the Ritz, Claridges and Langan's Brasserie. The prestigious three-year course of work-based training is arranged in partnership with the Academy of Culinary Arts, an association of Britain's top chefs and restaurant managers, and Waitrose, the supermarket chain. Leading chefs such as Anton Edelmann at The Savoy, Michel Bourdin at the Connaught and Richard Shepherd at Langan's restaurants sponsor students to study on the course. Unusually students are paid a minimum wage of \u00a355 a week by their sponsor who also pays for the cost of their accommodation with local families. There is, says Boland, a serious shortage of quality chefs in London hotels and restaurants. \"We are our own worst enemy. We have developed a philosophy that to be a good chef you have to work 16 hours a day, which is absolute nonsense. Very few establishments pay overtime, or double time for bank holidays or weekend work. You are expected to work Saturdays and Sundays. \"You work under immense pressure all the time.

His second was doing something about it. </p> <p>Soon after his arrival, John realised that at \u00a376 a week, the rent set by the institute was far more expensive than private arrangements with local landlords. \"I thought halls would be cheap and value for money, but it turned out that in the private sector you were paying for a lot better accommodation with a lot more room,\" says John. Although he had to wait until somebody could take his place in halls, John was eventually able to move into a shared house, 15 minutes walking distance from campus, for a weekly rent of \u00a345 - bills included. </p> <p>His friend and fellow student Nick Ponniah was not so lucky. Unable to transfer out of halls, he struggled to pay the rent. The institute held back his exam results and Nick had little choice but to abandon the course and work to pay off his arrears. He plans to start again next September, this time at a different university. </p> <p>A recent NUS survey listed Southampton Institute as having the third most expensive student accommodation in the country, second only to two London universities. Southampton Institute is also one of the early pioneers of an arrangement which is now known as the Private Finance Initiative (PFI), or Private Public Partnership (PPP). </p> <p>Institute spokesperson Robyn Mills explains: \"We have built seven halls of residence over four or five years using private developers. The reason for high prices is that we built on 1990s prices in a city centre. We didn't own our own land, and we had to go to a private company.\" </p> <p>Mills justifies the high rents by pointing out that the accommodation is fully maintained, managed and also secure for the students. \"That is one of the reasons that parents, in particular, like them,\" she adds. </p> <p>One thing the institute doesn't admit is that it is charging students a top-up fee to cover future risks. A source confirmed that the institute was charging at least \u00a340 per month over the odds to build up reserves for times when the student occupancy may drop. </p> <p>Bill Paytee is director of development at Servite Houses Housing Association, which in the early 1990s built and now manages an 800-capacity accommodation hall for the institute. Southampton's contract with Servite guaranteed occupancy, effectively binding the university to paying rent on rooms whether or not they are occupied. </p> <p>Paytee confirms that the institute has effectively passed on this risk to its students: \"Southampton are loading a supplement onto the money they have to pay us so they have to cover their risks and voids.\" </p> <p>With students already spending more than four-fifths of their income on accommodation, the growth area of PFI deals for higher education accommodation might be worth watching. The idea behind private/ public partnerships is that the private sector will bear the risks in return for a guaranteed income stream. </p> <p>Tim Russell, head of procurement and PFI advice at Higher Education Funding Council for England, says: \"You have to determine who takes which aspect of risk. It entirely depends on the sort of deal that the university actually makes. It is up to the university to say what they want. But if they want to make a deal with the private sector, then it will want to feel adequately rewarded.\" </p> <p>Hertfordshire, Luton and Sheffield are just some of the universities at various stages of PFI. Olivia Brown. welfare officer at Sheffield University, says \"The university wants to privatise all of its accommodation. They're well aware that we don't like it as an idea, but they are involving us in their discussions. They're saying it's the only way forward.\" </p> <p>A very vocal opponent of such schemes is the public service union Unison. Christine Lewis, national officer for education, says: \"It is not a good option. It is more expensive, it involves long contracts, and management for the halls goes out of the hands of the people that are publicly accountable. We have argued this long and hard, but it is seen as the only show in town for providing public buildings.\" </p> <p>Lewis also points out that student accommodation has become the most common form of PFI in higher education because it is such a safe bet. \"The attractiveness for a company is that they will get the rent for 20-25 years. The risk is supposed to be passed on to the private sector, but if it is underwritten it is hard to see how much risk they are actually passing on,\" she says. The private companies bidding for these type of contracts range from big property developers like Jarvies to the individual housing associations like Servite. </p> <p>Tim Russell believes that this growth area reflects shrewd business acumen. \"We are seeing more interest from the private sector in doing PFI deals because they can see the potential commercial opportunity.\" </p> <p>The idea of profit being made on the back of university accommodation might seem odd to some, but for now, the National Union of Students seems fairly relaxed about the whole thing. Spokesperson Simon Kemp says: \"The situation would depend on whether prices do increase without there being sufficient amenities to go alongside. Students may be happy to pay higher prices if they get closer and better facilities. It is not just who is doing it, but value for money.\" </p> <p>Quality does not seem to be in question. Current trends in PFI show that private organisations are keen to provide top-of-the-range accommodation in halls. </p> <p>The reason is simple: contractors are having to keep their eyes on two different markets. Bill Paytee explains: \"Students are only in halls for 38-39 weeks in the year. We have to find occupancy for the rest of the time. We are trying to ensure that the accommodation is also suitable for visitors. It's not quite a hotel-type trade, but that is why we have included the ensuite.\" </p> <p>Nice room if you can get it, but for students like Nick Ponniah, such a luxury remains a pipe dream. Whether PFIs will elevate the country's residential halls to pricey and posh, rather than cheap and cheerful, remains to be seen.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It was over coffee in the senior common room that the germ of a new approach to tackling Alzheimer's disease emerged. Susan Greenfield and David Vaux were not in the same department at Oxford University and there was no particular reason for them to meet and swap ideas - but as fellows of the same small college, it was perfectly natural to end up discussing the finer points of mechanisms involved in neuro-degeneration. The result was a major scientific collaboration and a spin-off company, Synaptica Ltd. </p> <p>That conversation in a dark oak-panelled room at Lincoln College was an example of the Oxbridge college system working well - top-class academics from different disciplines sparking ideas off each other in civilised surroundings, but still being engaged in the tutorial teaching of undergraduates. (Professor Greenfield has since moved on to head the Royal Institute, and is now to be seen giving tutorials at Number Ten to the Blairs and distinguished guests.) </p> <p>But as a way of educating students and supporting academics, colleges are outrageously expensive compared to the rest of British higher education; and the question is being voiced more loudly now - are they worth it? It is not just the cost of one-to-one teaching, but of operating in medieval buildings and the diseconomies of scale - each college has its own library, its own domestic and clerical staff and bursar. </p> <p>The government has certainly decided that their subsidy from the taxpayers should be less lavish: the \u00a32,000 premium that every student at Oxford and Cambridge receives is to be reduced by a third over the next ten years. It is a very gentle let-down, agreed after intense lobbying of Tony Blair - an alumnus of St John's College, Oxford - to soften the original proposal from education ministers. But it is a challenge to the colleges. </p> <p>Even more threatening to the sedate-looking college world is the cut-throat race to keep up with international research. These days a university has to be quick on its feet and well resourced to stay with the American and, increasingly, the Asian competition - can Oxford afford a ponderous federal decision-making process involving 36 colleges? </p> <p>A forthcoming book, Oxford and the Decline of the Collegiate Tradition, poses the question of how long colleges can survive as autonomous institutions choosing their own students and academics. The buildings, of course, will remain; but they could become little more than halls of residence with the principal reduced to an \"academic concierge\" and the bursar a \"toilet-roll distributor\", suggest Ted Tapper and David Palfreyman (himself bursar of New College). </p> <p>For the first time the book will provide an accurate estimate of the wealth of these secretive bodies - \u00a31.58bn in endowment capital. Their joint endowments bring in more than \u00a363m a year. Add to that academic fees, residential and catering charges, conference trade and tourism and fees for filming Inspector Morse and the like and their combined income is \u00a3136m a year. That is at least as much as the central University of Oxford receives from the funding council in grants and fees for teaching 16,300 students. It is more than the \u00a3115m the University of Sheffield gets for teaching 20,300 students. </p> <p>With money comes influence, although the rich colleges (like St John's with an income of \u00a36.8m) have to subsidise the poorer ones. Palfreyman, a drily humourous man whose office is as strewn with errant papers and books as any don's, admits colleges have been slow to adopt efficiency savings like joint purchasing. </p> <p>While the outside world suspects that too much money goes on high-table port, he argues that the college fee from the taxpayer all goes on teaching and library resources, and indeed that tutorial teaching is subsidised by college endowments - in the case of New College, set up by the founder William of Wykeham. (Income from the endowment also has to pay for a \u00a3500,000 replacement lead roof, which weighs heavily on the bursar's mind.) And student rooms in these old buildings now need internet connections as well as plumbing. (\"Baths?! But they're only here for eight weeks,\" as a 19th-century college head is supposed to have expostulated during a previous modernisation.) </p> <p>The fact that the academics in a college still choose their own students makes them more committed to teaching them, he suggests. </p> <p>\"From the outside Oxford looks hopelessly uneconomic, but we seem to be rather effective,\" he says. He adds that although on average better endowed than their Cambridge equivalents, Oxford colleges are undercapitalised compared to Harvard (\u00a35bn endowments) or Yale (\u00a33bn). </p> <p>His co-author, Ted Tapper, professor of politics at Sussex, is less committed to the college ideal. \"There is a tension in the book,\" he admits. \"Do 18-year-olds want to live in colleges anyway and stand on the towpath cheering their rowing team?\" </p> <p>Plenty do, says Jane Minto, admissions officer for Oxford - 9 out of 10 applicants go for a named college rather than an \"open\" application to the university. \"The opportunity for sport and drama in an informal atmosphere is an enormous plus. You get a chance to know students across all the disciplines.\" </p> <p>Both Tapper and Palfreyman see the college system under pressure from the \"three Ms\" - massification, managerialism and marketisation - and having to change substantially in the next 20 years. Their nightmare scenario is the decay of colleges as they are increasingly starved of income and influence - even the university abandoning its medieval buildings to Disney and operating from cyberspace. </p> <p>More likely, they say, is Oxford becoming more like Cambridge - where the central university has more control, where the vice-chancellor is appointed for a seven-year term, and where staff feel their main loyalty to the university rather than a college: \"The core of the academic faculty at Oxford will continue to wear the two hats of college and university but, as at Cambridge, there will be an increasing tendency for the university hat to assume greater significance. Within this framework the colleges will retain their independence, perhaps becoming more fissiparous, prepared to operate within the confines of university-established parameters, but less respectful of inter-collegiate constraints.\" </p> <p>A future where the richer colleges asserted more autonomy would be intensified if, as the authors believe is most likely, colleges start to charge differential top-up fees. The rich colleges would get richer, the poor perhaps go to the wall, and the universities would become more diverse: \"There will be several Oxfords as there will be several Cambridges.\" </p> <p>In this scenario Oxford and Cambridge universities are moving towards a Harvard model where research and teaching are more separate. \"The colleges will provide upmarket high-quality undergraduate teaching and increasingly the central university is the research centre,\" says Tapper. </p> <p>The colleges are still inefficient, not only in their domestic arrangements but in the way they organise their teaching, argues Chris Goodall, a local software company director, who offended the dons of Oxford by suggesting that colleges could make huge savings by pooling resources. He asked if each one of them really needed a bursar and a library. </p> <p>More radically, Goodall said that it was time each college gave up trying to teach virtually every subject. Since he made those comments in 1997 nothing much has changed, he feels. \"Nobody has really begun to address that crucial challenge that Oxford has to face - how to make sure students from poor families do not find it more difficult to go there.\" </p> <p>It would be wrong to underestimate the money-raising powers of the Oxford colleges, however, and at least some of that is being built up for scholarships, as well as to replace the college fee from the government as it is phased out over the next decade. </p> <p>The intense loyalty of former students to their colleges rather than to the larger university stems from their human scale, believes Sir Christopher Ball, a former warden of Keble College (and former bursar of Lincoln College). All the colleges have development offices which tap into this sentiment to raise large sums of money - nobody knows how much, but while the university raised \u00a3139m in an appeal between 1988 and 1994 on the back of its international reputation, a small college like Lincoln receives commitments of more than \u00a32m a year from old members. The former women's colleges tend to be less well endowed and their ex-members less wealthy. </p> <p>Sir Christopher outraged Oxbridge when he said that universities had secured excessive increases in college fees from the government \"like taking candy from children\". In the long term, one-to-one tuition could not be a proper use of public funds when the country was trying to extend higher education to half of all young people. </p> <p>He is confident that colleges, with their human scale, will adapt and survive by reverting to being privately funded, as they were for the best part of seven centuries. Today they could no longer try to have it both ways by taking state money: \"They are brilliant at surviving. They have outperformed almost anything else you can think of - where are the Tudors and Stewarts now? They have outlasted most private enterprises and many state institutions. Some will go to the wall as they have in the past - where is Gloucester College now, or St Albans Hall? But there is nothing worrying about a few Oxford colleges disappearing or merging.\" </p> <p>There is no doubt that college days leave their mark. Ask Greenfield. Over dinners at high table, romance with her fellow fellow Peter Atkins blossomed. Reader, she married him. </p> <p>\u0095 Oxford and the Decline of the Collegiate Tradition will be published by Woburn Press later this year. </p> <p><strong>Idle fellows</strong></p> <p>The historian Edward Gibbon remembered his college days in the 1750s without affection.</p> <p>\"I speIt fourteen months at Magdalen College; they proved the most idle and unprofitable of my whole life: the reader will pronounce between the school and the scholar; but I cannot affect to believe that nature had disqualified me for all literary pursuits. The fellows [of Magdalen] of my time were decent easy men, who supinely enjoyed the gifts of the founder; their days were filled by a series of uniform employments; the chapel and the hall, the coffee house and the common room, till they retired, weary and well satisfied, to a long slumber. From the toll of reading, or thinking, or writing, they had absolved their conscience; and the first shoots of learning and ingenuity withered on the ground... Dr ----- [his own tutor] well remembered that he had a salary to receive, and only forgot that he had a duty to perform.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Edward Gibbon, Memoirs</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was over coffee in the senior common room that the germ of a new approach to tackling Alzheimer's disease emerged. Susan Greenfield and David Vaux were not in the same department at Oxford University and there was no particular reason for them to meet and swap ideas - but as fellows of the same small college, it was perfectly natural to end up discussing the finer points of mechanisms involved in neuro-degeneration. The result was a major scientific collaboration and a spin-off company, Synaptica Ltd. That conversation in a dark oak-panelled room at Lincoln College was an example of the Oxbridge college system working well - top-class academics from different disciplines sparking ideas off each other in civilised surroundings, but still being engaged in the tutorial teaching of undergraduates. (Professor Greenfield has since moved on to head the Royal Institute, and is now to be seen giving tutorials at Number Ten to the Blairs and distinguished guests.) But as a way of educating students and supporting academics, colleges are outrageously expensive compared to the rest of British higher education; and the question is being voiced more loudly now - are they worth it? It is not just the cost of one-to-one teaching, but of operating in medieval buildings and the diseconomies of scale - each college has its own library, its own domestic and clerical staff and bursar. The government has certainly decided that their subsidy from the taxpayers should be less lavish: the \u00a32,000 premium that every student at Oxford and Cambridge receives is to be reduced by a third over the next ten years. It is a very gentle let-down, agreed after intense lobbying of Tony Blair - an alumnus of St John's College, Oxford - to soften the original proposal from education ministers. But it is a challenge to the colleges. Even more threatening to the sedate-looking college world is the cut-throat race to keep up with international research. These days a university has to be quick on its feet and well resourced to stay with the American and, increasingly, the Asian competition - can Oxford afford a ponderous federal decision-making process involving 36 colleges? A forthcoming book, Oxford and the Decline of the Collegiate Tradition, poses the question of how long colleges can survive as autonomous institutions choosing their own students and academics. The buildings, of course, will remain; but they could become little more than halls of residence with the principal reduced to an \"academic concierge\" and the bursar a \"toilet-roll distributor\", suggest Ted Tapper and David Palfreyman (himself bursar of New College). For the first time the book will provide an accurate estimate of the wealth of these secretive bodies - \u00a31.58bn in endowment capital. Their joint endowments bring in more than \u00a363m a year. Add to that academic fees, residential and catering charges, conference trade and tourism and fees for filming Inspector Morse and the like and their combined income is \u00a3136m a year. That is at least as much as the central University of Oxford receives from the funding council in grants and fees for teaching 16,300 students. It is more than the \u00a3115m the University of Sheffield gets for teaching 20,300 students. With money comes influence, although the rich colleges (like St John's with an income of \u00a36.8m) have to subsidise the poorer ones. Palfreyman, a drily humourous man whose office is as strewn with errant papers and books as any don's, admits colleges have been slow to adopt efficiency savings like joint purchasing. While the outside world suspects that too much money goes on high-table port, he argues that the college fee from the taxpayer all goes on teaching and library resources, and indeed that tutorial teaching is subsidised by college endowments - in the case of New College, set up by the founder William of Wykeham. (Income from the endowment also has to pay for a \u00a3500,000 replacement lead roof, which weighs heavily on the bursar's mind.) And student rooms in these old buildings now need internet connections as well as plumbing. (\"Baths?! But they're only here for eight weeks,\" as a 19th-century college head is supposed to have expostulated during a previous modernisation.) The fact that the academics in a college still choose their own students makes them more committed to teaching them, he suggests. \"From the outside Oxford looks hopelessly uneconomic, but we seem to be rather effective,\" he says. He adds that although on average better endowed than their Cambridge equivalents, Oxford colleges are undercapitalised compared to Harvard (\u00a35bn endowments) or Yale (\u00a33bn). His co-author, Ted Tapper, professor of politics at Sussex, is less committed to the college ideal. \"There is a tension in the book,\" he admits. \"Do 18-year-olds want to live in colleges anyway and stand on the towpath cheering their rowing team?\" Plenty do, says Jane Minto, admissions officer for Oxford - 9 out of 10 applicants go for a named college rather than an \"open\" application to the university. \"The opportunity for sport and drama in an informal atmosphere is an enormous plus. You get a chance to know students across all the disciplines.\" Both Tapper and Palfreyman see the college system under pressure from the \"three Ms\" - massification, managerialism and marketisation - and having to change substantially in the next 20 years. Their nightmare scenario is the decay of colleges as they are increasingly starved of income and influence - even the university abandoning its medieval buildings to Disney and operating from cyberspace. More likely, they say, is Oxford becoming more like Cambridge - where the central university has more control, where the vice-chancellor is appointed for a seven-year term, and where staff feel their main loyalty to the university rather than a college: \"The core of the academic faculty at Oxford will continue to wear the two hats of college and university but, as at Cambridge, there will be an increasing tendency for the university hat to assume greater significance. Within this framework the colleges will retain their independence, perhaps becoming more fissiparous, prepared to operate within the confines of university-established parameters, but less respectful of inter-collegiate constraints.\" A future where the richer colleges asserted more autonomy would be intensified if, as the authors believe is most likely, colleges start to charge differential top-up fees. The rich colleges would get richer, the poor perhaps go to the wall, and the universities would become more diverse: \"There will be several Oxfords as there will be several Cambridges.\" In this scenario Oxford and Cambridge universities are moving towards a Harvard model where research and teaching are more separate. \"The colleges will provide upmarket high-quality undergraduate teaching and increasingly the central university is the research centre,\" says Tapper. The colleges are still inefficient, not only in their domestic arrangements but in the way they organise their teaching, argues Chris Goodall, a local software company director, who offended the dons of Oxford by suggesting that colleges could make huge savings by pooling resources. He asked if each one of them really needed a bursar and a library. More radically, Goodall said that it was time each college gave up trying to teach virtually every subject. Since he made those comments in 1997 nothing much has changed, he feels. \"Nobody has really begun to address that crucial challenge that Oxford has to face - how to make sure students from poor families do not find it more difficult to go there.\" It would be wrong to underestimate the money-raising powers of the Oxford colleges, however, and at least some of that is being built up for scholarships, as well as to replace the college fee from the government as it is phased out over the next decade. The intense loyalty of former students to their colleges rather than to the larger university stems from their human scale, believes Sir Christopher Ball, a former warden of Keble College (and former bursar of Lincoln College). All the colleges have development offices which tap into this sentiment to raise large sums of money - nobody knows how much, but while the university raised \u00a3139m in an appeal between 1988 and 1994 on the back of its international reputation, a small college like Lincoln receives commitments of more than \u00a32m a year from old members. The former women's colleges tend to be less well endowed and their ex-members less wealthy. Sir Christopher outraged Oxbridge when he said that universities had secured excessive increases in college fees from the government \"like taking candy from children\". In the long term, one-to-one tuition could not be a proper use of public funds when the country was trying to extend higher education to half of all young people. He is confident that colleges, with their human scale, will adapt and survive by reverting to being privately funded, as they were for the best part of seven centuries. Today they could no longer try to have it both ways by taking state money: \"They are brilliant at surviving. They have outperformed almost anything else you can think of - where are the Tudors and Stewarts now? They have outlasted most private enterprises and many state institutions. Some will go to the wall as they have in the past - where is Gloucester College now, or St Albans Hall? But there is nothing worrying about a few Oxford colleges disappearing or merging.\" There is no doubt that college days leave their mark. Ask Greenfield. Over dinners at high table, romance with her fellow fellow Peter Atkins blossomed. Reader, she married him. \u0095 Oxford and the Decline of the Collegiate Tradition will be published by Woburn Press later this year. Idle fellows The historian Edward Gibbon remembered his college days in the 1750s without affection. \"I speIt fourteen months at Magdalen College; they proved the most idle and unprofitable of my whole life: the reader will pronounce between the school and the scholar; but I cannot affect to believe that nature had disqualified me for all literary pursuits. The fellows [of Magdalen] of my time were decent easy men, who supinely enjoyed the gifts of the founder; their days were filled by a series of uniform employments; the chapel and the hall, the coffee house and the common room, till they retired, weary and well satisfied, to a long slumber. From the toll of reading, or thinking, or writing, they had absolved their conscience; and the first shoots of learning and ingenuity withered on the ground... Dr ----- [his own tutor] well remembered that he had a salary to receive, and only forgot that he had a duty to perform.\" \u0095 Edward Gibbon, Memoirs",

      "body": "<p>When development judders to a halt, as in Sierra Leone or Zimbabwe now, where are the universities? Trying against all the odds to keep going. </p> <p>In Sierra Leone, whose Fourah Bay College dates back to 1827, concerned students have been playing their part - amid ravaged towns and amputated limbs - in the National Forum for Human Rights. In the University of Zimbabwe (whose chancellor is Comrade R Mugabe) students were teargassed at the time of the famous Harare Declaration in 1991. They and their academics have been steadily widening the political space in a de facto one-party state, in spite of economic rundown and physical intimidation. </p> <p>\"A country whose universities are allowed to decline is opting out of the development process at the start of the 21st century.\" This is the uncomfortable conclusion of a new report on the future of universities in developing countries, published by the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU). It is uncomfortable because, in the wake of the Dakar conference on the elusive target of education for all, cash-strapped governments may feel they are being pulled in impossibly contradictory directions. But the team put together by the Commonwealth Policy Studies Unit, and chaired by Paul Davenport, vice-chancellor of the University of Western Ontario, also offers hope: universities in developing countries can do a lot to help themselves. </p> <p>The team's thesis is that universities and their graduates are critical to the knowledge economy now driving socioeconomic development. This is true for Bangalore and Hyderabad in India, two of the IT hotspots in South Asia. At the other extreme, the sorry state of campuses in Nigeria and several other countries in sub-Saharan Africa is one reason for the decades of African development lost. </p> <p>In the 1960s the leaders of independence, themselves usually graduates, had no doubt that universities were crucial to nation-building and growth. But over the next 30 years academic stocks fell: brain drain, campus dissent, the seeming expense of tertiary education when set against demands for other tax-financed services and the 1990s preference for basic education at all costs undermined the universities. Underpaid staff and decaying facilities created a vicious circle in much of the Third World, and in countries like South Africa a huge range of private institutions of varying standards tried to fill the breach. </p> <p>The group chaired by Davenport included seven nationalities and a high-powered mix: among them were Goverdhan Mehta, director of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Andrew Downes, director of the Institute of Economic and Social Research at Cave Hill, Barbados; Ruth Pearson, Director of the Centre for Development Studies at Leeds; and Derrick Swartz, acting vice-chancellor at Fort Hare, Nelson Mandela's alma mater. The group met once, with support from the British Council, and then deliberated by email. </p> <p>The members do not challenge the importance of basic education, but they want a recognition, by political leaders and academics themselves, that universities are becoming increasingly crucial. Universities need to demonstrate accountability and have more flexible academic packages for students; they need to involve more stakeholders, benchmark their achievements, and do more to generate income from outside government. Special efforts will be needed to recruit good science and technology students by talent searches and scholarship schemes. Brain drain should be confronted, with firms in developed countries stimulating IT jobs in developing countries, and joint appointments straddling universities in developing and developed states. </p> <p>The group acknowledges that there is no simple, linear connection between higher education and development, but Downes quotes recent research from Ghana, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda to show that the rate of return for education at university level is higher than rates for primary and secondary education. The average tertiary gross enrolment for the five wealthiest Commonwealth countries (Singapore, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand) more than doubled from 27.2% in 1980 to 62.8% in 1996. However, among the lowest-income countries there were serious drops in tertiary enrolment in Zambia, Bangladesh and the Gambia in the same period. </p> <p>There is also an increasing awareness that universities in developing countries can be direct actors. And not only by setting up science parks or stimulating agricultural improvement. The famous Grameen Bank, the microcredit agency founded by Professor Mahammad Yunus of the economics department at Chittagong University, Bangladesh, resulted from fieldwork in neighbouring villages. </p> <p>When university research does bear fruit, however, it can be hard to ensure that the developing country itself reaps the rewards. One case in point involved a discovery by one of Mehta's Bangalore research colleagues that enhanced the scope and memory of silicon chips. The publication of his results sparked immediate commercial interest from Intel in the US, which contacted the researcher and offered to protect the intellectual property of his discovery and to take him under its wing. He reported at once to Mehta, who moved to protect the interests both of the researcher and of the Indian Institute of Science. As Mehta points out, however, it can be hard to get a fair deal because the US has a head start with its intellectual property lawyers. </p> <p>Other useful inputs come from students on sandwich courses, who spread best practice rapidly in institutions and communities. Pearson cites the master's course in international child welfare, run by the University of East Anglia in the UK, for people with social-work qualifications from the Third World. Its second semester is a unit of supervised professional practice in the student's own country, often in their original place of work. </p> <p>The report does not suggest that it will be easy to correct some of the problems. With the US, Germany and the UK all offering fast-track entry to IT personnel, especially from South Asia, the issue of brain drain remains serious. In 1990 almost a quarter of a million people with tertiary-level education from India lived in the US. Data shows that brain drain has seriously affected Fiji, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Gambia, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Jamaica and Trinidad. </p> <p>The Commonwealth study is a call to arms, one which has interesting parallels to a recent World Bank/Unesco publication Peril and Promise: Higher Education in Developing Countries. The Commonwealth Policy Studies Unit, a new thinktank attached to the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at London University, is working with the ACU to ensure that there is widespread discussion and follow-up. The report suggests universities could re-emphasise their social purpose with a Commonwealth University Charter for the new century. </p> <p>Already Ministers of Education and the Commonwealth Secretariat are working on a new, aspirational Education Declaration, to come out of a meeting of ministers at Halifax, Nova Scotia in November. It is hoped there will also be a special meeting in South Asia, and a presentation to next year's Commonwealth Business Forum in Australia, focused on the role of universities in development. </p> <p>Three years ago, in Edinburgh, the Commonwealth leaders signed up to the goal of halving the number of people living in absolute poverty by 2015. With the growth of the knowledge economy that goal cannot be achieved without universities.</p> <p>\u0095 Richard Bourne is head of the Commonwealth Policy Studies Unit.

It is uncomfortable because, in the wake of the Dakar conference on the elusive target of education for all, cash-strapped governments may feel they are being pulled in impossibly contradictory directions. But the team put together by the Commonwealth Policy Studies Unit, and chaired by Paul Davenport, vice-chancellor of the University of Western Ontario, also offers hope: universities in developing countries can do a lot to help themselves. The team's thesis is that universities and their graduates are critical to the knowledge economy now driving socioeconomic development. This is true for Bangalore and Hyderabad in India, two of the IT hotspots in South Asia. At the other extreme, the sorry state of campuses in Nigeria and several other countries in sub-Saharan Africa is one reason for the decades of African development lost. In the 1960s the leaders of independence, themselves usually graduates, had no doubt that universities were crucial to nation-building and growth. But over the next 30 years academic stocks fell: brain drain, campus dissent, the seeming expense of tertiary education when set against demands for other tax-financed services and the 1990s preference for basic education at all costs undermined the universities. Underpaid staff and decaying facilities created a vicious circle in much of the Third World, and in countries like South Africa a huge range of private institutions of varying standards tried to fill the breach. The group chaired by Davenport included seven nationalities and a high-powered mix: among them were Goverdhan Mehta, director of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Andrew Downes, director of the Institute of Economic and Social Research at Cave Hill, Barbados; Ruth Pearson, Director of the Centre for Development Studies at Leeds; and Derrick Swartz, acting vice-chancellor at Fort Hare, Nelson Mandela's alma mater. The group met once, with support from the British Council, and then deliberated by email. The members do not challenge the importance of basic education, but they want a recognition, by political leaders and academics themselves, that universities are becoming increasingly crucial. Universities need to demonstrate accountability and have more flexible academic packages for students; they need to involve more stakeholders, benchmark their achievements, and do more to generate income from outside government. Special efforts will be needed to recruit good science and technology students by talent searches and scholarship schemes. Brain drain should be confronted, with firms in developed countries stimulating IT jobs in developing countries, and joint appointments straddling universities in developing and developed states. The group acknowledges that there is no simple, linear connection between higher education and development, but Downes quotes recent research from Ghana, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda to show that the rate of return for education at university level is higher than rates for primary and secondary education. The average tertiary gross enrolment for the five wealthiest Commonwealth countries (Singapore, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand) more than doubled from 27.2% in 1980 to 62.8% in 1996. However, among the lowest-income countries there were serious drops in tertiary enrolment in Zambia, Bangladesh and the Gambia in the same period. There is also an increasing awareness that universities in developing countries can be direct actors. And not only by setting up science parks or stimulating agricultural improvement. The famous Grameen Bank, the microcredit agency founded by Professor Mahammad Yunus of the economics department at Chittagong University, Bangladesh, resulted from fieldwork in neighbouring villages. When university research does bear fruit, however, it can be hard to ensure that the developing country itself reaps the rewards. One case in point involved a discovery by one of Mehta's Bangalore research colleagues that enhanced the scope and memory of silicon chips. The publication of his results sparked immediate commercial interest from Intel in the US, which contacted the researcher and offered to protect the intellectual property of his discovery and to take him under its wing. He reported at once to Mehta, who moved to protect the interests both of the researcher and of the Indian Institute of Science. As Mehta points out, however, it can be hard to get a fair deal because the US has a head start with its intellectual property lawyers. Other useful inputs come from students on sandwich courses, who spread best practice rapidly in institutions and communities. Pearson cites the master's course in international child welfare, run by the University of East Anglia in the UK, for people with social-work qualifications from the Third World. Its second semester is a unit of supervised professional practice in the student's own country, often in their original place of work. The report does not suggest that it will be easy to correct some of the problems. With the US, Germany and the UK all offering fast-track entry to IT personnel, especially from South Asia, the issue of brain drain remains serious. In 1990 almost a quarter of a million people with tertiary-level education from India lived in the US. Data shows that brain drain has seriously affected Fiji, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Gambia, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Jamaica and Trinidad. The Commonwealth study is a call to arms, one which has interesting parallels to a recent World Bank/Unesco publication Peril and Promise: Higher Education in Developing Countries. The Commonwealth Policy Studies Unit, a new thinktank attached to the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at London University, is working with the ACU to ensure that there is widespread discussion and follow-up. The report suggests universities could re-emphasise their social purpose with a Commonwealth University Charter for the new century. Already Ministers of Education and the Commonwealth Secretariat are working on a new, aspirational Education Declaration, to come out of a meeting of ministers at Halifax, Nova Scotia in November. It is hoped there will also be a special meeting in South Asia, and a presentation to next year's Commonwealth Business Forum in Australia, focused on the role of universities in development. Three years ago, in Edinburgh, the Commonwealth leaders signed up to the goal of halving the number of people living in absolute poverty by 2015. With the growth of the knowledge economy that goal cannot be achieved without universities. \u0095 Richard Bourne is head of the Commonwealth Policy Studies Unit.

      "body": "<p>Keith Hollins is taking a class at the Westwood High School in Leek. It's an RE lesson and the group is getting on with some coursework. Keith helps where he can, but his speciality is geography and he found out he would be teaching this group less than half an hour ago. It's a cover lesson. </p> <p>Government statistics released last week show that sickness-related absence in schools amounts to more than 2.5 million days a year. More than half the workforce took time off through illness, an average of five days for each teacher at a cost of \u00a3300 million a year. </p> <p>But sickness is only half the story. The cover list at Westwood has only one teacher off ill. The A4 sheet has nine teachers out of lessons for all or part of the day. One is out of school with a sports team, two are supervising language exams and five are involved in an interview for a new staff member. Keith Hollins is covering for Dave Lyons, whose responsibility for newly qualified teachers means he needs to meet candidates to explain the school's induction procedures. </p> <p>Cover is the bane of many schools. In theory schools simply contact supply agencies, but many teachers see supply as a last resort; schools like Westwood use their own staff if they can. \"It's very difficult to come into a school and pick up the system,\" says Westwood's Keith Hollins. </p> <p>\"Supply teachers don't know the policies. They don't even know where the rooms are. When a class perceives that you know far less than them about what's going on in a school, it places you at a disadvantage.\" </p> <p>And cover is a real source of stress for teachers. \"It's the last-minute nature of it,\" says Hollins. \"I have a team of six tutors, five of whom have taught for three years or less. They find cover extremely stressful. You plan your marking, you plan your lesson preparation... and then you suddenly find you can't do either because you're on cover. It impinges on everything, you're always pushing things back.\" </p> <p>Parents are also concerned about a system that often leaves their children without proper teaching. \"It just seems to be an expensive baby-sitting service,\" said one, whose teenage daughter was following an exam course. \"The teacher was away and they were given a colouring-in exercise.\" Another reported that her child had been given the same history lesson four weeks running because the regular teacher had been on a course. </p> <p>Dorit Brown, the chief executive of the advice agency Parentline, argues that supply teachers often create problems because they're not aware of school policies or the background of the class they are taking. </p> <p>In secondary schools children may find their entire day managed by cover teachers. \"There are well-recorded instances of pupil tracking,\" says Robin Casson at Prudhoe Community High School in Northumberland, \"where pupils have had a succession of cover and supply teachers. They haven't seen a specialist teacher all day.\" </p> <p>And the supply of supply is drying up. In the late 80s and 90s, supply teachers were often those who had been given early retirement but still wished to keep in contact with the job by working occasionally. Restrictions on early retirement have cut off that source and in cities heads may have to spend hours on the phone searching for a stand-in teacher. </p> <p>In March Ruth Harker, the head of Bournville School in Birmingham, was unable to find anyone to cover an absence. \"There was no supply teacher at any agency in the city available for the absence we wanted to cover,\" she said. </p> <p>Heads in London are concerned about the situation in September, when many of the Australian supply teachers will return home for the Olympics. </p> <p>Some schools have imaginative answers to the problem.

      "bodyText": "Keith Hollins is taking a class at the Westwood High School in Leek. It's an RE lesson and the group is getting on with some coursework. Keith helps where he can, but his speciality is geography and he found out he would be teaching this group less than half an hour ago. It's a cover lesson. Government statistics released last week show that sickness-related absence in schools amounts to more than 2.5 million days a year. More than half the workforce took time off through illness, an average of five days for each teacher at a cost of \u00a3300 million a year. But sickness is only half the story. The cover list at Westwood has only one teacher off ill. The A4 sheet has nine teachers out of lessons for all or part of the day. One is out of school with a sports team, two are supervising language exams and five are involved in an interview for a new staff member. Keith Hollins is covering for Dave Lyons, whose responsibility for newly qualified teachers means he needs to meet candidates to explain the school's induction procedures. Cover is the bane of many schools. In theory schools simply contact supply agencies, but many teachers see supply as a last resort; schools like Westwood use their own staff if they can. \"It's very difficult to come into a school and pick up the system,\" says Westwood's Keith Hollins. \"Supply teachers don't know the policies. They don't even know where the rooms are. When a class perceives that you know far less than them about what's going on in a school, it places you at a disadvantage.\" And cover is a real source of stress for teachers. \"It's the last-minute nature of it,\" says Hollins. \"I have a team of six tutors, five of whom have taught for three years or less. They find cover extremely stressful. You plan your marking, you plan your lesson preparation... and then you suddenly find you can't do either because you're on cover. It impinges on everything, you're always pushing things back.\" Parents are also concerned about a system that often leaves their children without proper teaching. \"It just seems to be an expensive baby-sitting service,\" said one, whose teenage daughter was following an exam course. \"The teacher was away and they were given a colouring-in exercise.\" Another reported that her child had been given the same history lesson four weeks running because the regular teacher had been on a course. Dorit Brown, the chief executive of the advice agency Parentline, argues that supply teachers often create problems because they're not aware of school policies or the background of the class they are taking. In secondary schools children may find their entire day managed by cover teachers. \"There are well-recorded instances of pupil tracking,\" says Robin Casson at Prudhoe Community High School in Northumberland, \"where pupils have had a succession of cover and supply teachers. They haven't seen a specialist teacher all day.\" And the supply of supply is drying up. In the late 80s and 90s, supply teachers were often those who had been given early retirement but still wished to keep in contact with the job by working occasionally. Restrictions on early retirement have cut off that source and in cities heads may have to spend hours on the phone searching for a stand-in teacher. In March Ruth Harker, the head of Bournville School in Birmingham, was unable to find anyone to cover an absence. \"There was no supply teacher at any agency in the city available for the absence we wanted to cover,\" she said. Heads in London are concerned about the situation in September, when many of the Australian supply teachers will return home for the Olympics. Some schools have imaginative answers to the problem. Brooke Weston school in Corby is one of the most successful state schools in the country, but uses no supply teachers. \"We don't use supply,\" says its headteacher, Peter Simpson. Absence at Brooke Weston is covered internally. \"Classes are small, 25 or under, and we team teach,\" he says. \"It's well structured, well organised team-teaching. If one teacher is away the lessons can continue with the remaining member of staff managing both groups.\" For three years the Beacon Community School in east Sussex ran a system based on its computer suites.

There were other black graduates on her masters degree course in Manchester, but all had been educated abroad. </p> <p>\"As for undergraduates, there was not one doing science and engineering,\" she says. \"When I mentioned it to my supervisor, he talked about the hypocrisy of a British education system which purports to offer third-world countries help with education but can't seem to bring on British-born black children to become doctors, scientists and engineers. </p> <p>\"Perhaps the British Council should sort out kids in areas like Moss Side before trying to spread science and technology in Uganda.\" </p> <p>Rasekoala founded Ishango in 1995 with a few fellow black professionals who shared her frustration. More than 10 years on from her arrival from Africa, she felt nothing much had changed. Black children, she maintains, are \"under siege\" on three fronts - the home, the class room and the media. </p> <p>\"Look at hospital dramas here and in America,\" she says. \"You find black doctors in ER, but not in Casualty or Holby City. Nurses or paramedics, yes, but not doctors. It's difficult to appreciate what it means to grow up in a society where your only positive role models are in music and sport. </p> <p>\"And there's still an insidious stereotype, prevalent among teachers. Too many don't seem able to look at a black child and think about anything else but sport and music. Academic expectations are still pitched too low. It's very difficult for a black child to challenge a teacher's assumptions. That's true of parents, too. They're largely ignorant of the education system because they've had a devastating experience from it themselves.\" </p> <p>Some - invariably mothers - have recovered enough to realise that their children need a second chance which they never had. \"But it needs to be a real second chance,\" says Rasekoala, who is dismissive about Saturday morning classes in black history and culture. \"There are a lot of good intentions, but the academic rigour's not there. We live in a western technological society and these children need pieces of paper. </p> <p>\"The black community must work with the mainstream. We invited Ofsted because we're running a hard-edged programme with qualified teachers working with no more than 10 children at a time. And we're already addressing the criticisms put forward.\" </p> <p>\"Meanwhile, we want to get the message back to local education authorities and headteachers in mainstream schools that there must be a better way of doing things.\"</p>",

There were other black graduates on her masters degree course in Manchester, but all had been educated abroad. \"As for undergraduates, there was not one doing science and engineering,\" she says. \"When I mentioned it to my supervisor, he talked about the hypocrisy of a British education system which purports to offer third-world countries help with education but can't seem to bring on British-born black children to become doctors, scientists and engineers. \"Perhaps the British Council should sort out kids in areas like Moss Side before trying to spread science and technology in Uganda.\" Rasekoala founded Ishango in 1995 with a few fellow black professionals who shared her frustration. More than 10 years on from her arrival from Africa, she felt nothing much had changed. Black children, she maintains, are \"under siege\" on three fronts - the home, the class room and the media. \"Look at hospital dramas here and in America,\" she says. \"You find black doctors in ER, but not in Casualty or Holby City. Nurses or paramedics, yes, but not doctors. It's difficult to appreciate what it means to grow up in a society where your only positive role models are in music and sport. \"And there's still an insidious stereotype, prevalent among teachers. Too many don't seem able to look at a black child and think about anything else but sport and music. Academic expectations are still pitched too low. It's very difficult for a black child to challenge a teacher's assumptions. That's true of parents, too. They're largely ignorant of the education system because they've had a devastating experience from it themselves.\" Some - invariably mothers - have recovered enough to realise that their children need a second chance which they never had. \"But it needs to be a real second chance,\" says Rasekoala, who is dismissive about Saturday morning classes in black history and culture. \"There are a lot of good intentions, but the academic rigour's not there. We live in a western technological society and these children need pieces of paper. \"The black community must work with the mainstream. We invited Ofsted because we're running a hard-edged programme with qualified teachers working with no more than 10 children at a time. And we're already addressing the criticisms put forward.\" \"Meanwhile, we want to get the message back to local education authorities and headteachers in mainstream schools that there must be a better way of doing things.\"",

In five minutes, the first of nearly 400 human locusts will swarm through the dining-room, munching their way through mountains of pizza, burgers and chips. Within 40 minutes the onslaught will be over and all that will be left for the caterers to do is decide how to dispose of the salads, the baked potatoes and the lamb noodles that will have remained virtually untouched. </p> <p>School dinners have always come in for flak as few remember with affection the taste, or smell, of boiled cabbage and steak and gristle pie. But the debate has moved away from matters of taste to one of nutrition, amid fears that children are turning into junk-food addicts. Average sugar consumption has risen in Britain by more than 30% since 1980 and, according to the National Audit Office, Britain is the proud holder of the title for the fattest European nation, with 17% of men and 20% of women considered clinically obese. </p> <p>Of more concern to schools is the alarming rise in obesity in children, confirmed by a recent report from the Medical Research Council. It concludes that today's children are more at risk of developing osteoporosis, heart and respiratory diseases and some forms of cancer than their more deprived parents and grandparents. Eating habits are learned primarily at home, but research by Mintel on behalf of Iceland has found most parents believe schools should be doing more to teach children about healthy eating. </p> <p>But how do you convert that knowledge into practice? How do you get the little darlings to say no to chips? The simple answer is, you don't. You can put as many salads on the menu as you like, but given a choice of eating healthily or bingeing on junk, most children will opt for the latter. Caterers dare not take junk off the menu because they know kids will vote with their feet and head for McDonald's. </p> <p>There are no easy victories in the burger battle and most schools have reconciled themselves to a long war of attrition. Central Foundation is trying a different approach - stealth. Derek Powell, the deputy head, has been in charge of the school's catering makeover, involving a switch to new caterers. \"We have 840 pupils and only 300 or so were eating on site. Of these, roughly 250 were on free dinners. We looked at other schools and reckoned it was possible to get more boys in and make the food healthier and more appetising.\" </p> <p>So the doughnuts and pies have gone and a coat of paint, slicker service and a more appetising main course and pudding have come in. Powell has got it right on one count. Two weeks into the new regime and an extra hundred boys are using the dining-room, but they're nearly all packing in the saturated fats.</p> <p>Jesse is first through the door, making straight for the pizza, burgers and chips. \"I always eat pizza,\" he says, amazed that I should challenge him about his diet. Daniel and Bobby are on meal tickets, and for their \u00a31.25 allowance they choose pizza and chips. \"You used to be able to get a drink as well, but they've put the prices up,\" they chorus in outrage. So why not go for the main meal and pudding if you feel you're being ripped off? They look at me in disbelief, as the idea has clearly never crossed their mind. \"I need to feel filled up,\" says Daniel. </p> <p>The need to feel full is a common response among the boys when asked about their meal choice. But none associate feeling full with healthy eating. I only come across one boy who admits to thinking about his diet and eating salad. A couple have a go at the lamb noodles and cauliflower cheese and only one boy, Jake, opts for the ham sandwich. \"I actually wanted a slice of pizza, but they'd sold out,\" he confesses. </p> <p>Powell admits it's an uphill struggle to improve diets as there's a fine balance between a healthy menu and an empty dining-room, but he hopes to gradually ensure that chips are not a daily option. David Marney, senior operations manager for Chartwells, the caterers, appears unconvinced, but tries to reassure me that pizza is not that unhealthy before adding, \"we do make sure that the healthier options are the best value on the menu\". </p> <p>But price is not really the issue. There is a certain correlation between low-income families and poor diet but these boys aren't stupid. They know what is and isn't healthy. They just don't give a damn one way or the other. They are still young enough to feel immortal, untouched by adult concerns of obesity and heart disease. In any case, they find the appeal and marketing of junk food specialists, McDonald's and KFC, infinitely more attractive than a few government directives. </p> <p>So what can be done? For the boys at secondary school the answer is almost certainly not very much - unless parents take more responsibility and stop expecting schools to deal with the problem in isolation. At primary school it may be a different matter. The department of social medicine at Bristol University, in conjunction with the health promotion division of the National Assembly for Wales, has been piloting a fruit tuck shop project in 28 schools in the west country. </p> <p>\"The aim is to get nine and 10-year- olds to eat more healthily,\" says Dr Joanna Moe, a researcher on the project. \"We targeted schools where there was no tuck shop, and asked them to set one up, to be run by the children, which only sold fruit. The idea was that if children had money that could only be spent on fruit, they would rather do that than not spend it all.\" The results will not be available till later this year, but Dr Moe is happy with the results so far. But will these children take their good habits on to secondary school? \"Ah,\" she sighs, \"that's the big unanswered question.\" Watch this space. </p> <p>\u0095 Contact Lucy Burns at Focus on Food, tel: 01422-383191.</p>",
