Jo Kirk, sports administrator at the British University Sports Association, has been responsible for setting up the games, a task requiring a year-long planning schedule that would tax even a top athlete. More than 500 competitors and officials will spend a week at this year's host venue, Birmingham university, where national teams drawn from university sports clubs in each of the four countries of the UK will compete in five sports: soccer, badminton, basketball, hockey and netball. </p> <p>It will be a crowded week with eight competitions running simultaneously. Each country fields men's and women's teams in soccer, basketball and hockey, and Kirk, 27, has had to arrange the playing schedules, officials and venues for each event, liaising with national and team managers over practicalities and team selection. And as soon as this year's games finish, Kirk and her colleagues will begin planning next year's event in Glamorgan. </p> <p>It's an exhausting time, and Kirk is grateful that the games happen just once a year. But the event is not her only responsibility. As sports administrator she has to organise national championships in archery, boxing, canoeing, hockey, rugby fives, snooker and surfing. It may seem an eclectic selection, but there is some logic to it. Busa organises competitions in 47 sports throughout the year, so shares the sports so that each of the five administrators based in the organisation's London headquarters has an equal workload. \"Some sports have one annual championship, others have year-round competitions,\" explains Kirk. </p> <p>Whatever the sport, some headaches are common to all: \"You get the people who want to enter a competition after the entry date, and others pulling out at the last minute.\" But it is natural to have favourites, and Kirk, a hockey player herself, admits to having a particular interest in the hockey championships. She plays defence for Bracknell in the National League, so attending BUSA hockey events is pleasure as well as business. </p> <p>Working with unfamiliar sports can be more of a challenge. Last April, for instance, Kirk organised Busa's annual equestrian competition, a task that involved liaising with local stables to find mounts for the riders. This is because of a convention that nobody enters with their own horse - it makes for a fairer competition and a better test of the rider's ability, but can be a headache if you are responsible for tracking down 10 suitable horses for dressage and 10 for showjumping. </p> <p>A graduate in sports science from the university of Brighton, Kirk's transition from sports enthusiast to professional was not seamless. It is not a strictly vocational degree, and when she left college she found that lack of work experience was an obstacle to finding a job in sports, her ambition since she had been at school. She made up for this with a few years doing general administration for a timber company and an insurance firm. </p> <p>Two years ago Kirk saw an advertisement for a clerical post with Busa, took the job, and was eventually promoted to her current position. \"I very much enjoy working in sport, and would like to move into sports marketing or management in the future.\" </p> <p>First of all, however, she has to get through this year's event. The Princess Royal will preside at this evening's opening ceremony, and the games will run until Thursday, after which Kirk admits she will be glad of a break. \"I am certainly looking forward to this time next week.

No longer do you need to trek around cities looking for suitable premises - the meeting rooms, staff and even branded mineral water can be set up overnight to your most minute specifications. </p> <p>Regus, one of the largest suppliers of serviced offices, was the brainchild of Mark Dixon, an entrepreneur from Chelmsford in Essex who in previous business incarnations ran a burger bar and a bakery. The company now has a global network of 277 serviced offices around the world and is growing at the rate of one new office every four days. Locations include cities as far afield as Bratislava, Dar es Salaam and Bogot\u00e1. </p> <p>Dixon had the idea to form an instant-office service in 1989 while using an office facility in a hotel. Noting how valuable the service was to businesspeople on the move, he hit on the idea of staffing permanent serviced offices in every city around the world. It was the end of his bread-baking days; the revenue from the sale of his bakery funded the first Regus centre in Brussels. He chose the Belgian capital as it was the city where he had first hit on his brainwave, and where he had stumbled across a suitable building at a bargain price. </p> <p>Serviced offices can be rented for as little as three months, but are also available on a more flexible basis. Meeting rooms can be hired for as little as \u00a325 an hour from MWB, an instant-office firm that has been in business for only 18 months but already has offices in 29 locations around the UK. Businesses rent a room if they need a prestigious location for an important meeting but are reluctant to bring their clients to their normal place of work. </p> <p>But the company's main business is with larger firms who want to hire office space on a short- to medium-term lease. \"Our primary clients are companies dealing with IT, recruitment or financial services,\" says Gil Scott, business development manager at MWB. He is based at the company's offices in Fleet Street in central London, a site that has six floors containing 93 separate offices. \"Only a couple of our clients have left when they say they are going to. They usually tend to stay longer because they get comfortable. They've got everything on hand. They don't have to deal with utilities, don't have to worry about IT, cabling or phone lines,\" he says. </p> <p>This is the real advantage of the serviced office, according to HQ Global Workplaces, an American company which was founded in 1967 and describes itself as \"an outsourced real estate provider\". Julian King, business development director, says: \"The serviced office has been growing in significance in the past five years. They are highly attractive to global companies and multinationals - companies that need to manage change. What we offer is immediate access, flexible terms. </p> <p>\"Companies operate much faster now. Product cycles are much shorter and project teams are created and dismantled very quickly. They don't want to be worrying about taking on ten year leases each time they have to find space to place a project team.\" </p> <p>What these clients do want, however, is a highly attentive service from the firms supplying their offices. Regus, for one, emphasises its willingness to bend over backwards to accommodate clients' requirements. \"You just have to say, 'This is what I want,'\" says Caroline Richards, coaching centre manager at the company's office in Covent Garden. \"We'll furnish the room, heat it, service and clean it. We provide toilet paper, tampons and deodorant in the ladies', and shaving kits in the gents'. There's milk, tea, sugar, cups and saucers in the kitchens. The vending machines are full. We'll type for you, bind for you, we'll organise your kid's seventh birthday party. We are a PA, receptionist, office manager, facilities manager. You get a key to your room, you come in and we'll make sure everything is up and running.\" </p> <p>Such exacting standards of service, and the rapid turnover of clients, mean that the serviced office industry is a hectic environment in which to work. \"It's like you are juggling 100 balls at a time,\" says Richards. In the company's early days, sales people trudged around doors to cold call on businesses - today many of the company's clients access their services by the web. The skills of the salespeople of old are still very much in demand, however. As an employer, Regus appeals to the ambitious 20-something female. Each of the company's offices has its own particular sales targets, though hardworking staff do reap the rewards - at the end of last year shares in the firm were offered to all employees, regardless of job title or length of service. </p> <p>Regus specialises in videoconferencing facilities, and encourages clients to make use of the technology to conduct screen-to-screen meetings across the world. The UK's Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply has found that using videoconferencing instead of travelling to meetings can save 75% on the cost of meetings - a big saving for the client, but still a considerable expenditure for Regus services. </p> <p>The company is even prepared to tell a few white lies to make your business or enterprise appear larger or more prestigious than it is in reality. A service known as Link is popular with sole traders or freelancers who may be just setting up, but want to give the impression that they have a prestigious and fully staffed office in central London. For around \u00a3200 per month, clients can use Regus's prime-location address as their own, without hiring a physical space within the building. Staff will answer all phone calls during office hours in the client's company name and they can choose to have their mail forwarded or picked up from offices. </p> <p>\"We are receptionists/PAs from a distance, so those clients ringing you don't know that you are not sitting at a desk in your office in Covent Garden. You could be sitting at home in your converted garage,\" says Richards. \"We don't say to callers, 'Oh no, such-and-such doesn't work here.'\" And if someone actually turns up on the doorstep? \"We have to say, 'I'm sorry but she's out all week on appointments and is due back in the office next week' - so we cover it that way.\" Based in an impressive listed building on Longacre, Richards is quick to name-drop some of the clients who use the company's space, and the prestigious neighbours that add cachet to firms renting offices in the building. With the British Council one of the tenants, and neighbours such as Scottish Amicable, IBM and Cable &amp; Wireless, it is certainly a blue-chip location. </p> <p>MWB is currently trying to capture the booming market in technology start-ups. \"We take care of the smaller requirements such as the start-up companies, emphasising that we can be flexible and take care of their business,\" says Scott. \"The serviced-office sector is being fuelled by the dot.com revolution, so there is synergy between the two sectors, even leaving aside the IT-based companies. Property markets are probably considering serviced offices a lot more now. The idea is logical - that companies should focus on what they do and let someone else worry about the management of the property.\" </p> <p>Regus certainly has grand plans. If the comparisons you choose for yourself are a marker of ambition, it is telling that the company's preferred yardstick is Microsoft. \"In 1997 we did a comparison between Microsoft and Regus, and discovered that in the first nine years of Microsoft, Bill Gates had 500 employees and turned over $50m (\u00a331m). In our first 10 years we had 600 employees and a \u00a360m turnover. Mark Dixon's mission is to change the way people work,\" says Richards. </p> <p>As a result, Regus concerns itself only with prime site locations. \"We will decide if there is a market for a serviced-office environment in a city, and then we will hit that town to find the best address - it's got to be the best,\" she says. \"We usually spend \u00a31m on a building. We'll get all the lighting, the partitioning, all the new air conditioning, furniture. It's always leather furniture. There's usually a six-to-eight-week turnaround period from signing papers to getting the first customer in.\" </p> <p>Not cheap, perhaps, but certainly convenient and efficient. The drawback of this is a homogeneity in all the company's offices that some might find bland. Regus boasts that it has 257 standards that have to be met when setting up an office, compared to McDonald's 53 standards when making a burger. The checklist is certainly detailed: a Regus office will always have smear-free glasses placed face down on a Regus mat. Bottles of still and sparkling water must have their labels facing in the same direction, and must be placed on a paper doily on a silver tray. Tea has to be served with the teaspoon at right angles to the handle of the cup. </p> <p>\"You know if you've booked one of our touchdown offices that there's going to be a desk lamp, a letter opener, three Regus pencils. You can be sure that the water's labels will be facing the same direction,\" says Richards. \"Once you become a Regus client you become part of the global network. You know what you are getting - it's like knowing that a McDonald's vanilla milkshake is going to taste the same anywhere in the world.\" Perfect if you feel like a fast food office to go.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Can't afford a mortgage since house prices have rocketed? Join the club. Even the government has recognised that in order for the public sector to continue attracting employees, some of its workers will need financial help to buy property. Research from the national federation of housing (NFH) has found that buyers need annual earnings of more than \u00a320,000 to buy an average home in three-quarters of England's counties. In eight counties, you'll need to earn \u00a340,000, and in parts of inner London, the income required jumps to a ludicrous \u00a370,000. </p> <p>The economy may be booming, with wage levels remaining generous, but spiralling house prices are making it increasingly difficult for anyone other than dot.com millionaires to buy more than a cupboard. And secretaries have little hope of getting any help. The starter home initiative, launched last week by the government, states that only \"key workers\" in the public sector will be offered mortgage subsidy schemes. </p> <p>\"It is unclear what is meant by 'key',\" says Liz Potter, director of policy for the NFH, \"but we suspect it refers to teachers and nurses. That's because the government's concern is that house prices in areas such as London are preventing qualified nurses and teachers from moving there. For secretarial roles, which don't require formal qualifications, there isn't a recruitment problem. The government sees it as a case of 'if it ain't broke, why fix it?'\" </p> <p>If the government isn't prepared to help, what about employers? Thirty-nine per cent of support staff would consider a mortgage subsidy the most attractive benefit, according to a recent survey by recruitment specialists Gordon Yates and the Guardian. The bad news is that only 3% of them receive it. </p> <p>Angela Baron, policy adviser to the Institute of Personnel and Development, sees this as short-sighted. \"If secretarial staff can't afford housing in London, they, too, will eventually stop working there and move to an area where they can afford to live. The labour market in London will suffer enormously, and employers will find there just aren't the people to fill the jobs.\" </p> <p>It was precisely this widening gap between house prices and salaries that led to the introduction of London weighting, a salary top-up for those living in the pricey capital.

      "bodyText": "Can't afford a mortgage since house prices have rocketed? Join the club. Even the government has recognised that in order for the public sector to continue attracting employees, some of its workers will need financial help to buy property. Research from the national federation of housing (NFH) has found that buyers need annual earnings of more than \u00a320,000 to buy an average home in three-quarters of England's counties. In eight counties, you'll need to earn \u00a340,000, and in parts of inner London, the income required jumps to a ludicrous \u00a370,000. The economy may be booming, with wage levels remaining generous, but spiralling house prices are making it increasingly difficult for anyone other than dot.com millionaires to buy more than a cupboard. And secretaries have little hope of getting any help. The starter home initiative, launched last week by the government, states that only \"key workers\" in the public sector will be offered mortgage subsidy schemes. \"It is unclear what is meant by 'key',\" says Liz Potter, director of policy for the NFH, \"but we suspect it refers to teachers and nurses. That's because the government's concern is that house prices in areas such as London are preventing qualified nurses and teachers from moving there. For secretarial roles, which don't require formal qualifications, there isn't a recruitment problem. The government sees it as a case of 'if it ain't broke, why fix it?'\" If the government isn't prepared to help, what about employers? Thirty-nine per cent of support staff would consider a mortgage subsidy the most attractive benefit, according to a recent survey by recruitment specialists Gordon Yates and the Guardian. The bad news is that only 3% of them receive it. Angela Baron, policy adviser to the Institute of Personnel and Development, sees this as short-sighted. \"If secretarial staff can't afford housing in London, they, too, will eventually stop working there and move to an area where they can afford to live. The labour market in London will suffer enormously, and employers will find there just aren't the people to fill the jobs.\" It was precisely this widening gap between house prices and salaries that led to the introduction of London weighting, a salary top-up for those living in the pricey capital. The theory was that the extra funds could be used to subsidise rent or mortgages or, for those living in the suburbs, commuting costs. \"But at a mere \u00a32,000 a year, it doesn't go very far these days,\" says Baron. In any case, the NFH argues that high house prices are no longer a problem unique to London and the south east. \"Across the nation there are areas where people are priced out of a home,\" says Potter.

Like Americans in the war they are often seen as overpaid and over here, looking smarter and sassier than the dog-tired full-timers and coming in with a whole range of skills learnt during their short-term lets.</p> <p> But the down side is the constant fast-track induction. You hit the ground running and colleagues are not always queuing up to offer help and advice. Remember the hell that is the first three months in any new job? When you learnt the ropes and dodged the office politics and both at the same time? Well how would you like a whole line of that experience laid back-to-back?</p> <p><strong>The survival guide</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Wear a thick skin. Preferably rhino hide. Some companies adore their temps and they are treated like the relief arriving at Maffekin. At others they are seen as the over-cheery outsider who will show the regulars up if they are not taken down a peg or two. <br>\u0095 Avoid the use of inflammatory phrases like: \"They did it much better in my last company\" or \"I can't believe you're still using that system here.\" Pretend to be amazed and to acquire wisdom and knowledge, rather than impart it. <br>\u0095 Avoid over-exaggerated territorial claims using too many personal touches on the desk. A framed photo of a cute-looking pet can be a good ice-breaker, even if it is a borrowed prop.<br>\u0095 Never expect sympathy about stress. The general consensus will be that no-one suffers as much stress as the full-time staff.

      "bodyText": "There's good and bad to being a temp. Bad in the fact that relationships and situations built at work will be fleeting, and good for exactly the same reason. To those working an occupational life sentence the life of a temp looks idyllic, which is where temp envy can kick in. Like Americans in the war they are often seen as overpaid and over here, looking smarter and sassier than the dog-tired full-timers and coming in with a whole range of skills learnt during their short-term lets. But the down side is the constant fast-track induction. You hit the ground running and colleagues are not always queuing up to offer help and advice. Remember the hell that is the first three months in any new job? When you learnt the ropes and dodged the office politics and both at the same time? Well how would you like a whole line of that experience laid back-to-back? The survival guide \u0095 Wear a thick skin. Preferably rhino hide. Some companies adore their temps and they are treated like the relief arriving at Maffekin. At others they are seen as the over-cheery outsider who will show the regulars up if they are not taken down a peg or two. \u0095 Avoid the use of inflammatory phrases like: \"They did it much better in my last company\" or \"I can't believe you're still using that system here.\" Pretend to be amazed and to acquire wisdom and knowledge, rather than impart it. \u0095 Avoid over-exaggerated territorial claims using too many personal touches on the desk. A framed photo of a cute-looking pet can be a good ice-breaker, even if it is a borrowed prop. \u0095 Never expect sympathy about stress. The general consensus will be that no-one suffers as much stress as the full-time staff. They labour under anxieties about take-overs, down-sizing and corporate re-structures that leave the temp relatively unscathed. Always appear concerned and sympathetic if any of these issues come up in conversation. Again, never use the phrase: \"That happened in my last company\", especially if it is followed up by the words \"enforced\" and \"redundancies\". \u0095 Walk the job and introduce yourself exactly as though you were staying for good. Show an interest in the bigger corporate issues. Learn peoples' names quickly, via: repeating imaging - seeing a visual picture of an object connected with the name visualising the name written over the person's head or: connecting - conjuring up an image of someone else with the same name. \u0095 Fast-track friendships with colleagues by jotting down notes on details you have been given. This will help you to refer to their children/make of car/hobbies etc without the memory-aid of a long-term relationship. \u0095 Ask for help. This is always a disarming technique. People hate a smarty-pants and a genuine-sounding request will help prevent the smug tag. \u0095 Write out a layout of the place when you are first shown round, plus a map of everyone's desks and offices.

      "body": "<p>The ritual was decorously observed. David Mather of Oxford Universities ran in gingerly, bowled a slowish full toss to Somerset's captain, Jamie Cox, who patted it to mid-off. The English cricket season had been launched. No fanfare for the three or four hundred spectators but there was an absence of snow, which ridiculed the English game last April. </p> <p>The season tiptoes into our consciousness, shamefacedly interrupting the constant stream of footballing controversies only with an alleged betting scandal rather than any deeds of derring-do on the field. A couple of limp fixtures with the universities may constitute a marketing man's disaster, but what sane promoter would plan a public relations bonanza on 7 April when there is every chance that trying to play cricket is as futile as skiing in Skegness? </p> <p>The season has never started earlier. Marcus Trescothick, England hopeful, soon acquired the dubious of distinction of the making the earliest duck recorded in an English cricket season. Soon after, Michael Burns struck the earliest century. But cricket was played and the gloom-mongers were denied an easy strike. </p> <p>Yet the 2000 season starts with English cricket under siege. When a recent former England captain denounces county cricket by saying that 'I do not think it serves any purpose whatsoever', as Mike Atherton did on his return from South Africa, all is not rosy on the domestic front. Atherton may have a point. Start from scratch and we would not design the season on current lines; there would not be 18 teams for a start; there may not even be professional county cricketers. </p> <p>But Atherton's logic is brutal, dismissing the haphazard evolution of the game over the past century as if it could be swept away with one vigorous wave of the hand. It can't. Moreover, once the condemnation of county cricket becomes routine, it becomes dangerous. Say it often enough and no one ques tions the thesis. English domestic cricket is far from perfect, but it is not completely bankrupt. The counties do some sterling work, via their academies, their youth teams and their liaisons with local clubs in an effort to compensate for the lack of cricket in our schools. And they remain our only source of potential Test cricketers. </p> <p>Albeit reluctantly, they have embraced change. This season the Championship will be contested in two divisions as the one-day league was last year.

If the West Indies can perform adequately in their forthcoming series against Pakistan, Lara will also be obliged to do as he's told upon his return by the impressive new regime of captain Jimmy Adams and coach Roger Harper since he won't have much leeway to play the prima donna after a raw young side (with the exceptions of Walsh and Ambrose), has suggested that he is no longer indispensable. The series against the West Indies should be absorbing and closely contested, unlike the traditionally lopsided fixtures that gently launched the season at Fenner's and Taunton.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The ritual was decorously observed. David Mather of Oxford Universities ran in gingerly, bowled a slowish full toss to Somerset's captain, Jamie Cox, who patted it to mid-off. The English cricket season had been launched. No fanfare for the three or four hundred spectators but there was an absence of snow, which ridiculed the English game last April. The season tiptoes into our consciousness, shamefacedly interrupting the constant stream of footballing controversies only with an alleged betting scandal rather than any deeds of derring-do on the field. A couple of limp fixtures with the universities may constitute a marketing man's disaster, but what sane promoter would plan a public relations bonanza on 7 April when there is every chance that trying to play cricket is as futile as skiing in Skegness? The season has never started earlier. Marcus Trescothick, England hopeful, soon acquired the dubious of distinction of the making the earliest duck recorded in an English cricket season. Soon after, Michael Burns struck the earliest century. But cricket was played and the gloom-mongers were denied an easy strike. Yet the 2000 season starts with English cricket under siege. When a recent former England captain denounces county cricket by saying that 'I do not think it serves any purpose whatsoever', as Mike Atherton did on his return from South Africa, all is not rosy on the domestic front. Atherton may have a point. Start from scratch and we would not design the season on current lines; there would not be 18 teams for a start; there may not even be professional county cricketers. But Atherton's logic is brutal, dismissing the haphazard evolution of the game over the past century as if it could be swept away with one vigorous wave of the hand. It can't. Moreover, once the condemnation of county cricket becomes routine, it becomes dangerous. Say it often enough and no one ques tions the thesis. English domestic cricket is far from perfect, but it is not completely bankrupt. The counties do some sterling work, via their academies, their youth teams and their liaisons with local clubs in an effort to compensate for the lack of cricket in our schools. And they remain our only source of potential Test cricketers. Albeit reluctantly, they have embraced change. This season the Championship will be contested in two divisions as the one-day league was last year. The system of central contracts has been agreed and - glory be - the 12 chosen players have signed them. These changes won't suddenly transform the game, but they are an indicator that the counties recognise that they have to make some sacrifices en route to a more successful national team. If the weather permits, the start of the county season could be diverting. It begins next Saturday with a round of Benson and Hedges Cup matches (a competition that returns after one year's hiatus).

But the move shows he has ambition. And he can play a bit. About this time a year ago, he bowled to me in the nets for an hour and, while it wasn't Shane Warne v Sachin Tendulkar, Imran - a tall, converted medium-pacer - googled it, top-spun it, floated it, pinged it, swung it... impressive trickery delivered from the top of an elegant, smooth action. </p> <p>If England were looking for an answer to Warne, here, at the very least, was the raw material.

But you don't whistle up Chris Schofields out of thin air. A lot of Imrans can be left behind in a top-heavy strategy. </p> <p>The problem is that Atherton is half-right: the four-day game does encourage time-serving and, in a perfect world, we would have a dozen counties rather than 18.

All the evidence shows that crowds will come to that, particularly the day-night game, and we proved it last year. We had three crowds over 9,000 and we averaged just under 7,000.

      "byline": "Sandy Warr",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If you like to spice up your cricketing season - here's a new game for you. Forget spread bets on how many overs will actually be bowled on the first damp day of the new season, or even an office sweepstake on how many batting collapses we'll witness before the summer is out. The smart money will be on how many times the great and the good who run cricket will try to persuade us that 2000 marks a new and exciting era for the sport. </p> <p>Granted there are interesting developments this season, just as there were last year when Lord's welcomed a frighteningly futuristic new press centre, as if determined to find a physical representation of how forward-looking the sport's spiritual home has become. Cricket, it seems, has been as keen to recruit spinners in the tradition of Alistair Campbell as Shane Warne in the battle to persuade us to turn out in droves and buy into the game's 'new era'. But if they are to make a real breakthrough this season then there is one group of enthusiasts who still need to be won over: women. Most women I talk to who regularly watch the sport and play it have battled rejection, derision and outright hostility as they seek to indulge their passion. Cricket must stop turning a cold shoulder on its female fans and turn on the charm. </p> <p>You might wonder why I take this so personally, but then cricket is in my blood. I was brought up with tales of derring-do from my great-grandfather William Fairservice in the great Kent county side of 1909. My great-uncle Colin Fairservice played a role in bringing on the talent of David Gower, and my grandmother Audrey Fairservice played for Kent and Essex and was selected to bat for the England women's team. Pregnancy intervened and her dream was never realised. Sadly she died before I was able to ask her of the struggle she and her contemporaries must have had in being taken seriously. </p> <p>The women's game has progressed enormously in the past two decades, with a 19 per cent rise in the number of players in the past two years, but the experience of visiting many grounds as a spectator is still locked into the past. I have watched cricket all over the world since bunking off school early to to watch Essex. I would try quiet county grounds like Hove or Arundel or my beloved Chelmsford only to find some bored lothario assuming I must be there to pick up a man - how could a single young woman actually want to watch the game? But it's the crowded international games that have caused the most distress. </p> <p>There have admittedly been great improvements in recent years. The MCC has, finally, admitted women into the holiest of holies - the Pavilion at Lord's. It might seem churlish to suggest cricket has realised that if it is to get a share of new development grants it has to be seen to be paying more than lip service to equal access. Forgive my cynicism about motives, but turn up to cover a cricket match as a female member of the press and you'd think you'd flown in from another planet. 'Helpful' officials have asked when my boyfriend would be arriving to occupy the seat I was so helpfully keeping warm for him. </p> <p>A minor irritation, perhaps, but the attitude filters down from the organisers to the fans. And it's the way they treat women in the crowd that must pose the biggest challenge to cricket's ambitions for a broader fan base. Mix a long hot day, a boisterous crowd, plenty of beer and very few women among the spectators and you have a recipe for problems. Most women who go to matches on their own know there are areas of the ground you avoid after lunch unless you're the type who likes wander ing into a pub in the middle of a stag night. I've lost count of the number of times I have been invited to display my assets 'for the lads'. Certain grounds have become infamous for barracking. Edgbaston has a fearsome reputation among women supporters. And at the Sydney Cricket Ground stewards issue ominous warnings about avoiding the area once occupied by the Hill - if you want to emerge unscathed. </p> <p>I know cricket feels more fun when the crowd is fired up with enthusiasm (and let's face it watching England play at international level often needs a little spiritual support before it can be truly termed entertainment), but do we want to see lager louts colonise cricket? </p> <p>Football is an interesting case study for cricket. Female supporters make up an ever-increasing proportion of the crowd - family enclosures have been encouraged and seating areas improved in the wake of the Taylor Report. This is something cricket needs to emulate. </p> <p>Cricket needs to market itself in a brighter- dare I say, sexier - manner to a broader audience, and that doesn't mean advertising campaigns featuring supermodels or TV celebrities who know little and care less about the sport. It needs ambassadors who are not linked to the old traditionalists in the rhubarb and custard ties. </p> <p>And once it has persuaded us into the grounds it must look after us better.

      "bodyText": "If you like to spice up your cricketing season - here's a new game for you. Forget spread bets on how many overs will actually be bowled on the first damp day of the new season, or even an office sweepstake on how many batting collapses we'll witness before the summer is out. The smart money will be on how many times the great and the good who run cricket will try to persuade us that 2000 marks a new and exciting era for the sport. Granted there are interesting developments this season, just as there were last year when Lord's welcomed a frighteningly futuristic new press centre, as if determined to find a physical representation of how forward-looking the sport's spiritual home has become. Cricket, it seems, has been as keen to recruit spinners in the tradition of Alistair Campbell as Shane Warne in the battle to persuade us to turn out in droves and buy into the game's 'new era'. But if they are to make a real breakthrough this season then there is one group of enthusiasts who still need to be won over: women. Most women I talk to who regularly watch the sport and play it have battled rejection, derision and outright hostility as they seek to indulge their passion. Cricket must stop turning a cold shoulder on its female fans and turn on the charm. You might wonder why I take this so personally, but then cricket is in my blood. I was brought up with tales of derring-do from my great-grandfather William Fairservice in the great Kent county side of 1909. My great-uncle Colin Fairservice played a role in bringing on the talent of David Gower, and my grandmother Audrey Fairservice played for Kent and Essex and was selected to bat for the England women's team. Pregnancy intervened and her dream was never realised. Sadly she died before I was able to ask her of the struggle she and her contemporaries must have had in being taken seriously. The women's game has progressed enormously in the past two decades, with a 19 per cent rise in the number of players in the past two years, but the experience of visiting many grounds as a spectator is still locked into the past. I have watched cricket all over the world since bunking off school early to to watch Essex. I would try quiet county grounds like Hove or Arundel or my beloved Chelmsford only to find some bored lothario assuming I must be there to pick up a man - how could a single young woman actually want to watch the game? But it's the crowded international games that have caused the most distress. There have admittedly been great improvements in recent years. The MCC has, finally, admitted women into the holiest of holies - the Pavilion at Lord's. It might seem churlish to suggest cricket has realised that if it is to get a share of new development grants it has to be seen to be paying more than lip service to equal access. Forgive my cynicism about motives, but turn up to cover a cricket match as a female member of the press and you'd think you'd flown in from another planet. 'Helpful' officials have asked when my boyfriend would be arriving to occupy the seat I was so helpfully keeping warm for him. A minor irritation, perhaps, but the attitude filters down from the organisers to the fans. And it's the way they treat women in the crowd that must pose the biggest challenge to cricket's ambitions for a broader fan base. Mix a long hot day, a boisterous crowd, plenty of beer and very few women among the spectators and you have a recipe for problems. Most women who go to matches on their own know there are areas of the ground you avoid after lunch unless you're the type who likes wander ing into a pub in the middle of a stag night. I've lost count of the number of times I have been invited to display my assets 'for the lads'. Certain grounds have become infamous for barracking. Edgbaston has a fearsome reputation among women supporters. And at the Sydney Cricket Ground stewards issue ominous warnings about avoiding the area once occupied by the Hill - if you want to emerge unscathed. I know cricket feels more fun when the crowd is fired up with enthusiasm (and let's face it watching England play at international level often needs a little spiritual support before it can be truly termed entertainment), but do we want to see lager louts colonise cricket? Football is an interesting case study for cricket. Female supporters make up an ever-increasing proportion of the crowd - family enclosures have been encouraged and seating areas improved in the wake of the Taylor Report. This is something cricket needs to emulate. Cricket needs to market itself in a brighter- dare I say, sexier - manner to a broader audience, and that doesn't mean advertising campaigns featuring supermodels or TV celebrities who know little and care less about the sport. It needs ambassadors who are not linked to the old traditionalists in the rhubarb and custard ties. And once it has persuaded us into the grounds it must look after us better. Good stewarding is one imperative - keeping an eye on the rowdier elements in the game and getting as tough with sexist abuse as racism. Let's have better catering, more comfortable seats, and creative links with schools to help youngsters love and understand cricket. A broadcasting colleague once said women should not be welcomed into the cricket grounds of this country because they would be forever gossiping about the rising price of Pampers just as Courtney Walsh was steaming in to bowl.

      "body": "<p>It is a pity that Samuel Beckett, good player and lifelong cricket fan, never wrote about the game. 'Waiting for Goddard' would have greatly enhanced cricket's literature. Or James Joyce, a useful bat according to his brother, but whose only contribution was a coded list in Finnegans Wake: 'She had to spofforth, she had to kicker, too thick of the wick of her pixy's loomph, wide lickering jessup the smooky shiminey'. Harold Pinter has written well on the game, especially his delightful memoir of Arthur Wellard with whom he played for his theatrical team the Gaieties, but for the most part truly great writers have not graced cricket. </p> <p>It is often said that cricket has a great literature, but that is arguable. Certainly, it has a large literature; in his essay on cricket-writing in the centenary Wisden , John Arlott estimated that there were about 8,000 titles, far more than any other game. He argued that this number emphasised 'the unique quality of cricket in stimulating art, imagination and study'; he was less sanguine about the results - often those inspired to write proved less than inspirational. </p> <p>The arch-enemies of cricket-writing are wistfulness, artifice and silliness. There are too shelves full of dim biographies, tedious tour books, unrevealing memoirs, jokey reminiscences. Arlott, again, referred to 'too many hastily written books, prepared for a quick-buying, quick-forgetting market'. </p> <p>Publishers for too long took their market for granted, assumed that book-buyers' love of and loyalty to the game was limitless, that they would buy any old tosh. In recent years, this has proved ill-founded. One distinguished cricket writer told me recently that the market had slumped and that no one now would publish his books: chickens have come home to roost, golden geese have been laid off, only Dickie Bird seems to have survived the slaughter. </p> <p>A trawl through the cricket section of London bookshop Sportspages is dispiritingly predictable. Bird, of course; tributes to Brian Johnston and Alan McGilvray; biographies of former greats and a clutch of biographies of current or recently retired players; further outpourings from the WG industry; badly produced books of jokes and quotes; tour guides; club histories; fond memories of pre-war Australian Tests. </p> <p>One word sums up the output: nostalgia. With a few exceptions, the shelves at Sportspages are an invitation to wallow. Cricket literature is largely characterised by reverence for the game - its traditions, character and ethos - and has been dominated by Englishmen, often using cricket to memorialise a better, truer past. Since the 1830s cricket writers have hymned a golden age, usually a generation or two before the period in which they were writing. </p> <p>Take the example of Sydney Goodman, eulogising village cricket in an anthology called The Light Side of Cricket, published in 1898: 'In village cricket are seen to their best advantage the rural and romantic elements of the game ... Under the blue sky, field after field stretches far away to the wooded hills, while from hedge and copse alike comes the music of birds and streams, and the mingled fragrance of summer flowers. This primeval grace and rural poetry of the game is in great measure lost in routine-like dullness in vast and crowded amphitheatres surrounded by ugly pavilions, smoky houses and evil-smelling gasometers... and round it still lingers that halo of glory which many minds love to associate with most things of a far-off and forgotten time.' </p> <p>This end-of-century anthology sums up an approach to cricket that we have never quite shaken off: dewy-eyed reminiscence, limp fiction, condescending reports of cricket at the edge of empire, lamentable poetry, the unfaltering belief that cricket is the best of England. Take the final contribution, by AN Other: 'What do I think of cricket? Why, I think it's the noblest of sport - bar none - of all those noble sports which have done so much to make Englishmen the fine stalwart fellows they are, and Old England the grand country she is.' I keep looking for irony in this piece and finding none, while the report of an Ethiopian cricket match can simply not be quoted, so offensive is it to modern ears. A different age and different sensibilities, of course, yet with an enduring legacy for our attitude to the game. </p> <p>The 1890s were still in thrall to WG. The Rev Harold A Tate (author of Life Scores and Mode of Dismissal of WG Grace in First-Class Cricket ) stood up for the champion against the upstart generation: 'It is often amusing to hear people speak of K.S. Ranjitsinhji, and his leg-glances and pulls, as if these strokes had never been known before. I remember WG making them off Morley, Emmett and Hill 20 years ago, and making them so frequently as not even Ranjitsinhji on much easier wickets has been able to equal.' </p> <p>The Rev Tate also deployed that very 1890s weapon, statistics, to make his case that Grace was superior to younger contenders for the all-rounder's crown. The end of the century saw a growing interest in comparing and contextualising players - many jostled to be outstanding in the world of the average, along with short-lived annuals (often spin-offs from the highly competitive newspapers of the period). </p> <p>One hundred years ago, most of the elements of 20th-century cricket-writing were in place: the pastoralism; the belief in the rootedness and essential Englishness of the game; the obsession with statistics; the co-opting of famous players in commercial enterprises, as with Ranji's Jubilee Book of Cricket (1897); the defence of past against present - this even in the most gilded of golden ages. The memorable practitioners did not emerge until the 1920s, yet they were refining the themes of their less illustrious predecessors, rather than attempting to rewrite the script. The orthodoxy established in 1900 was later given literary form by a generation that saw the years before the First World War as arcadia: it was a lyrical, elegaic view of a game inseparable from the fields and villages of England. That was its strength, and its great limitation. </p> <p>Most cricket-writing reflects a sense of loss, though sometimes it is clothed in the garb of celebration. Kenneth Gregory's anthology claims to be just that - it is called In Celebration of Cricket - but he chooses to end with a passage from Edmund Blunden: 'They vanish, these immortal players, and we suddenly realise with astonishment that years have passed since we heard a passing mention of some of them. At one point they seem as much a part of the permanent scheme of things as the sun which glows upon their familiar faces and attitudes and the grass which makes the background for their portrait, and then, bless us, it is time for even them to go.' </p> <p>There is a contradiction at the heart of cricket: it is a game with great continuity, but also a sense of closure, preoccupied at once with changelessness and decay. Take Cardus. In Cricket All the Year, he writes: 'Cricket has no past and no present. The seasons mingle in one another as with no other game.' Yet in Cricket, he writes of bidding farewell to a season with such regret that you can see the sinking sun, feel the chill of the approaching autumn: 'One late August afternoon, I said goodbye to a cricket season on a field which lay silent in the evening sunshine; the match, the last of the year, was over and the players gone. I stayed for a while in the falling light and saw birds run over the grass as the mists began to spread.That day we had watched Woolley in all his glory, batting his way through a hundred felicitous runs ... It was all over and gone now, as I stood on the little field alone in the glow of the declining day.' </p> <p>Cardus's strain of romanticism is easily parodied, as Peter Sellers and Peter Munro Smith demonstrated in The Boundary Book: 'Broiling afternoon... the muted coo of pigeons... cucumber sandwiches ... distant tinkle of ice in lemonade jug... satisfying clunk of pad against willow ... warp and woof of very fabric ... shadow of church spire... white figures moving like ghosts...where else but in England...' </p> <p>Where else indeed. Add Cardus's assertion that 'There can be no summer in this land without cricket' to Michael Melford's dictum that 'Cricket isn't a game, it's a way of life', and you have the core of the - for want of a better phrase - tweedy English view that has dominated the literary representation of cricket in the past: romantic, lyrical, infused with a sense of love and loss. </p> <p>It has produced works of passion, elegance and beauty, yet at the beginning of a new century the tradition appears played out. The convoluted, self-conscious style of the Cardus school is unwieldy for modern readers; we want our prose in black and white, not purple. Its anglocentricity is absurd for a game where the balance of power now lies on the Indian subcontinent and in Australia. The commemoration of the past is dangerous for a sport that must quickly find a role for the future. Cricket-writing, like cricket itself, must remake itself. </p> <p>In doing so, the model should perhaps not be the elegance and erudition of Cardus or Alan Ross, but the wit and astringency of Robertson-Glasgow ('I have never regarded cricket as a branch of religion ... I have never believed that cricket can hold empires together'), the cultural breadth of CLR James, the honesty and simplicity of style of Arlott, the maverick qualities of David Foot, the coolness of Brearley, the bloody-mindedness of Simon Hughes. Wit, vision, a close reading of the game, a sense of its languor and lunacies, rather than unremitting reverence, should henceforth dictate the play, dominate the field. </p> <p>Michael Davie and Simon Davie's excellent anthology, The Faber Book of Cricket, did unearth one previously unrecognised piece of cricket prose by an unquestionably great writer, Evelyn Waugh, though he was only 20 when he wrote it. It was published in the Oxford student magazine Cherwell and recounts a disastrous day when his cricket-mad brother Alec drafted him into a college side. It is everything that the traditional, lyrical view of village cricket is not. 'When I returned home, I reasoned thus with myself,' wrote Waugh. 'Today I have wearied myself utterly; I have seen nothing and no one of any interest; I have suffered discomfort of every sense and in every limb; I have suffered acute pain in my great toe; I have walked several miles; I have stood about for several hours; I have drunken several pints of indifferently good beer; I have spent nearly two pounds ... But my brother maintained that it had been a great day. Village cricket, he said, was always like that.' </p> <p>The rosy-eyed romantics should declare and let the revisionists in to bat. Subvert the stereotypes of cricketing parsons and public schools, hymn the joys of global cricket, let writing play its part in re-energising the game for a new age, a generation less devoted to a dreamy past. The pen may yet prove mightier than the sward. </p> <p>\u0095 Stephen Moss is a writer on the Guardian. He was the paper's literary editor from 1995-98.</p>",

This primeval grace and rural poetry of the game is in great measure lost in routine-like dullness in vast and crowded amphitheatres surrounded by ugly pavilions, smoky houses and evil-smelling gasometers... and round it still lingers that halo of glory which many minds love to associate with most things of a far-off and forgotten time.' This end-of-century anthology sums up an approach to cricket that we have never quite shaken off: dewy-eyed reminiscence, limp fiction, condescending reports of cricket at the edge of empire, lamentable poetry, the unfaltering belief that cricket is the best of England. Take the final contribution, by AN Other: 'What do I think of cricket? Why, I think it's the noblest of sport - bar none - of all those noble sports which have done so much to make Englishmen the fine stalwart fellows they are, and Old England the grand country she is.' I keep looking for irony in this piece and finding none, while the report of an Ethiopian cricket match can simply not be quoted, so offensive is it to modern ears. A different age and different sensibilities, of course, yet with an enduring legacy for our attitude to the game. The 1890s were still in thrall to WG. The Rev Harold A Tate (author of Life Scores and Mode of Dismissal of WG Grace in First-Class Cricket ) stood up for the champion against the upstart generation: 'It is often amusing to hear people speak of K.S. Ranjitsinhji, and his leg-glances and pulls, as if these strokes had never been known before. I remember WG making them off Morley, Emmett and Hill 20 years ago, and making them so frequently as not even Ranjitsinhji on much easier wickets has been able to equal.' The Rev Tate also deployed that very 1890s weapon, statistics, to make his case that Grace was superior to younger contenders for the all-rounder's crown. The end of the century saw a growing interest in comparing and contextualising players - many jostled to be outstanding in the world of the average, along with short-lived annuals (often spin-offs from the highly competitive newspapers of the period). One hundred years ago, most of the elements of 20th-century cricket-writing were in place: the pastoralism; the belief in the rootedness and essential Englishness of the game; the obsession with statistics; the co-opting of famous players in commercial enterprises, as with Ranji's Jubilee Book of Cricket (1897); the defence of past against present - this even in the most gilded of golden ages. The memorable practitioners did not emerge until the 1920s, yet they were refining the themes of their less illustrious predecessors, rather than attempting to rewrite the script. The orthodoxy established in 1900 was later given literary form by a generation that saw the years before the First World War as arcadia: it was a lyrical, elegaic view of a game inseparable from the fields and villages of England. That was its strength, and its great limitation. Most cricket-writing reflects a sense of loss, though sometimes it is clothed in the garb of celebration. Kenneth Gregory's anthology claims to be just that - it is called In Celebration of Cricket - but he chooses to end with a passage from Edmund Blunden: 'They vanish, these immortal players, and we suddenly realise with astonishment that years have passed since we heard a passing mention of some of them. At one point they seem as much a part of the permanent scheme of things as the sun which glows upon their familiar faces and attitudes and the grass which makes the background for their portrait, and then, bless us, it is time for even them to go.' There is a contradiction at the heart of cricket: it is a game with great continuity, but also a sense of closure, preoccupied at once with changelessness and decay. Take Cardus. In Cricket All the Year, he writes: 'Cricket has no past and no present. The seasons mingle in one another as with no other game.' Yet in Cricket, he writes of bidding farewell to a season with such regret that you can see the sinking sun, feel the chill of the approaching autumn: 'One late August afternoon, I said goodbye to a cricket season on a field which lay silent in the evening sunshine; the match, the last of the year, was over and the players gone. I stayed for a while in the falling light and saw birds run over the grass as the mists began to spread.That day we had watched Woolley in all his glory, batting his way through a hundred felicitous runs ... It was all over and gone now, as I stood on the little field alone in the glow of the declining day.' Cardus's strain of romanticism is easily parodied, as Peter Sellers and Peter Munro Smith demonstrated in The Boundary Book: 'Broiling afternoon... the muted coo of pigeons... cucumber sandwiches ... distant tinkle of ice in lemonade jug... satisfying clunk of pad against willow ... warp and woof of very fabric ... shadow of church spire... white figures moving like ghosts...where else but in England...' Where else indeed. Add Cardus's assertion that 'There can be no summer in this land without cricket' to Michael Melford's dictum that 'Cricket isn't a game, it's a way of life', and you have the core of the - for want of a better phrase - tweedy English view that has dominated the literary representation of cricket in the past: romantic, lyrical, infused with a sense of love and loss. It has produced works of passion, elegance and beauty, yet at the beginning of a new century the tradition appears played out. The convoluted, self-conscious style of the Cardus school is unwieldy for modern readers; we want our prose in black and white, not purple. Its anglocentricity is absurd for a game where the balance of power now lies on the Indian subcontinent and in Australia. The commemoration of the past is dangerous for a sport that must quickly find a role for the future. Cricket-writing, like cricket itself, must remake itself. In doing so, the model should perhaps not be the elegance and erudition of Cardus or Alan Ross, but the wit and astringency of Robertson-Glasgow ('I have never regarded cricket as a branch of religion ... I have never believed that cricket can hold empires together'), the cultural breadth of CLR James, the honesty and simplicity of style of Arlott, the maverick qualities of David Foot, the coolness of Brearley, the bloody-mindedness of Simon Hughes. Wit, vision, a close reading of the game, a sense of its languor and lunacies, rather than unremitting reverence, should henceforth dictate the play, dominate the field. Michael Davie and Simon Davie's excellent anthology, The Faber Book of Cricket, did unearth one previously unrecognised piece of cricket prose by an unquestionably great writer, Evelyn Waugh, though he was only 20 when he wrote it. It was published in the Oxford student magazine Cherwell and recounts a disastrous day when his cricket-mad brother Alec drafted him into a college side. It is everything that the traditional, lyrical view of village cricket is not. 'When I returned home, I reasoned thus with myself,' wrote Waugh. 'Today I have wearied myself utterly; I have seen nothing and no one of any interest; I have suffered discomfort of every sense and in every limb; I have suffered acute pain in my great toe; I have walked several miles; I have stood about for several hours; I have drunken several pints of indifferently good beer; I have spent nearly two pounds ... But my brother maintained that it had been a great day. Village cricket, he said, was always like that.' The rosy-eyed romantics should declare and let the revisionists in to bat. Subvert the stereotypes of cricketing parsons and public schools, hymn the joys of global cricket, let writing play its part in re-energising the game for a new age, a generation less devoted to a dreamy past. The pen may yet prove mightier than the sward. \u0095 Stephen Moss is a writer on the Guardian. He was the paper's literary editor from 1995-98.",

If this claim were proved to be so, it would have serious consequences for cricketing and political relations between the countries.

'But this thing is rife in cricket and the biggest mistake we could make would be to try to sweep it under the carpet without an investigation.' </p> <p>Someone who would understand Cronje's position is John Fashanu, acquitted of match-rigging in football. He said: 'From my own point of view, it's not the mere fact of losing money - and it cost me more than \u00a31million in legal fees and other costs. Money comes and goes. But your reputation is forever. That's the legacy of something like this. </p> <p>'I want my kids to say, \"That's John Fashanu, my father, he's an ambassador for Unicef\", not someone who was accused of match-fixing. </p> <p>'In our case, it was so ridiculous anyway to think that one or two players could influence a match. But strange things happen. Innocent people do get convicted of things they didn't do. People do go to jail when they shouldn't. Look at Nelson Mandela, the Birmingham Six. It's then that you think to yourself, \"Hell, can I get out of this thing?\" ' </p> <p>A betting man might say Cronje and his team-mates will clear their name, although they would be reluctant to give evidence in person. The answer to the riddle looks to reside on a tape in an Indian radio station.</p>",

Why someone would want to smear Cronje - the cricketing equivalent of Nelson Mandela, a man of unsullied character renowned for his dignity, good manners and commitment to the new South Africa - is unclear. One former international claimed it might be based on deep-seated enmity reaching back to the days of apartheid. If this claim were proved to be so, it would have serious consequences for cricketing and political relations between the countries. They are due to play again in a one-day tournament in Sri Lanka this summer. The proliferation of these tournaments is one reason bookmakers have attached themselves to leading players in the past. The awful prospect of the charges being true was not totally discounted in some circles. 'I'd be astonished if it had happened in this instance,' the former South African captain, Kepler Wessels, said. 'But this thing is rife in cricket and the biggest mistake we could make would be to try to sweep it under the carpet without an investigation.' Someone who would understand Cronje's position is John Fashanu, acquitted of match-rigging in football. He said: 'From my own point of view, it's not the mere fact of losing money - and it cost me more than \u00a31million in legal fees and other costs. Money comes and goes. But your reputation is forever. That's the legacy of something like this. 'I want my kids to say, \"That's John Fashanu, my father, he's an ambassador for Unicef\", not someone who was accused of match-fixing. 'In our case, it was so ridiculous anyway to think that one or two players could influence a match. But strange things happen. Innocent people do get convicted of things they didn't do. People do go to jail when they shouldn't. Look at Nelson Mandela, the Birmingham Six. It's then that you think to yourself, \"Hell, can I get out of this thing?\" ' A betting man might say Cronje and his team-mates will clear their name, although they would be reluctant to give evidence in person. The answer to the riddle looks to reside on a tape in an Indian radio station.",

The Inzaghi story is an Italian story, a beautiful story, but also a story that makes you weep a little. </p> <p>Twenty-six years ago, to a woman named Marina Inzaghi, a child was born. He was baptised Filippo. Three years later Marina bore him a brother named Simone. By the time Simone was eight, he was captaining his elder brother in the village football team. </p> <p>Filippo (or Pippo) and Simone grew into tall boys with lanky dark hair and a knack for scoring goals (from a range of two yards or less). Pippo turned pro, then Simone did too. But when Pippo made it to Juventus, Simone was still in the third division. Then God smiled on Simone, and he won a contract with Piacenza, his local team. In his first season in Serie A he scored 15 goals. Last summer he joined Lazio: now the two best teams in Italy each had an Inzaghi. </p> <p>Simone and Filippo were famous, but not half as famous as the mother who gave birth to two Serie A goalscorers. Each day, Marina speaks in Italian newspapers. (The boys have a father, too, Giancarlo, but all we know of him is that he sells textiles and is happily married to Marina. No one cares about Giancarlo.) </p> <p>When the boys left home, Marina chose housekeepers for them, but she still tries to do their laundry and she shops for Pippo. 'I think Pippo hardly ever goes to the supermarket,' she confides. Had the boys not become footballers, Marina would have liked them to be doctors, even though they could hardly have practised legally given that both have degrees in accountancy. </p> <p>Marina also likes to bring her sons Sunday lunch. 'They really love every kind of food that I cook, from tortellini to cannelloni,' she reveals (Italian mammas have not yet found out about lamb dansak and won ton soup). </p> <p>Pippo, who says he has refused offers from Manchester United, Chelsea and Atletico Madrid, says, 'My mother knows how to cook for me. If I lived abroad, I couldn't enjoy her meals.' Sceptics are asking whether Marina Inzaghi exists, or whether she is a creation of anarchists out to destroy the traditional Italian family by means of parody. </p> <p>There has been a frenzy of Mamma Inzaghi stories in the last month. On 14 March, in a Champions League match against Marseille, Simone scored four goals. On 29 March, the boy who had begun the season on Lazio's bench made his debut for Italy as a substitute against Spain. Pippo played too (the heart breaks) but alas, the boys were not on the pitch at the same time. Italy lost 2-0. </p> <p>Last weekend, Simone's Lazio visited Pippo's Juventus. Marina did not watch, saying it would have made her too nervous. Papa, allowed a rare public statement, said, 'At least this way if one of them loses, he can console himself with the fact that the other has won.' </p> <p>Somehow neither Inzaghi scored, but Lazio beat Juventus 1-0 and are now only three points behind them. 'Either way, the league title is staying in the family,' says Simone. </p> <p>No one could have imagined a story so beautiful, not even La Gazzetta dello Sport , that has long carried the feature 'My son the footballer'. But behind the beautiful story is a sad one about Italian football. </p> <p>It is now feasible that at Euro 2000 Italy will field an all-Inzaghi forward line. That is because Christian Vieri is injured, while Alessandro del Piero is tormented. Del Piero never scores from open play any more, only from free-kicks and penalties. Some feel that Del Piero's team-mate at Juve, Pippo Inzaghi, is partly to blame. It was noted that when Pippo scored a hat-trick against Venezia recently, two of his goals came from unlikely angles when a pass would have given Del Piero an open net. Pippo already has 26 goals this season. Does he really need so many? </p> <p>It prompted Wednesday's Gazzetta to suggest that he and Del Piero do not like one another. They seldom pass to each other, the newspaper noted. The players hotly denied the story, but it still runs. </p> <p>The newspapers have taken to recalling historic Juventus tiffs: Platini against Furino, and back in the Fifties, Boniperto against Sivori. </p> <p>The Inzaghis may be Italy's best goalscorers, and certainly no one else has such a beautiful story (not even Vieri, whose grandfather brought him from Sydney to Italy), but neither ranks with the greats. Both have something of Paolo Rossi about them, but to paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen addressing Dan Quayle, 'I knew Paolo Rossi. Senator, you are no Paolo Rossi.' </p> <p>The Inzaghis are fast, play on the edge of the offside trap (and frequently five yards over it), but neither has an immaculate touch. If they are the best Italy has to offer, then no wonder Italian football is in trouble. </p> <p>The Azzurri are floundering: last autumn they contrived to lose at home to Belgium. Lazio, the last Italian club in the Champions League, are surely about to leave it after losing 5-2 to Valencia on Wednesday night. But their first goal came, of course, from Simone Inzaghi.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Perceptions do not change all that quickly in football. Chelsea are not as big a name as Barcelona, so while Wednesday's upsetting of the apple-cart was a high point for Gianluca Vialli and a wonderful tonic for the fans, the hard-nosed element left Stamford Bridge bemoaning Luis Figo's important away goal and doubting the Blues' ability to protect a two-goal cushion in the Nou Camp. </p> <p>Chelsea supporters can cope with the media talking down their chances, but will be a little concerned at key personnel catching the disease. 'They will play better in the second leg, there's no doubt they are a goal machine,' Vialli conceded, not quite striking the can-do note fans were looking for in the immediate aftermath of such a euphoric victory. 'Barcelona are used to this kind of situation, they will not be panicking,' said a realistic Marcel Desailly, one of Chelsea's outstanding performers in the 3-1 win. </p> <p>So is that it? Plucky English underdogs give it their best shot in home tie but surrender to the inevitable in front of 100,000 screaming Catalans in the cauldron that is Barcelona's home? Are Chelsea planning to admire Louis van Gaal's team into submission? Thankfully no. Desailly, who has seen and done a bit, knows exactly what will be required on Tuesday week. </p> <p>'That was not necessarily our best performance of the season, though people might assume it was because we beat Barcelona,' he said. 'I actually thought we were stronger against Milan. We can play better, and that's what we will need to do. We have to go to the Nou Camp and be really magnificent.' </p> <p>That may be easy for a Frenchman who has won everything to say, but, although it goes against the grain of the English inferiority complex, the point to remember is that Chelsea are not English. There is no doubt Manchester United overcame an inferiority complex last year, particularly an inability to eliminate top Italian sides; their manager talked of it frequently as first Internazionale and then Juventus were humbled in Italy. United's 2-0 first leg win against Inter and Ronaldo's compromised fitness in Milan meant the second leg of the quarter-final was relatively straightforward for Sir Alex Ferguson's players, but the real test of United's self-belief came in the semi-final. Only a Ryan Giggs goal in the final minute salvaged a barely deserved draw from the home leg, then when the strongly fancied Juventus scored two quick goals in Turin it began to look as if they would underline their superiority and mock United's presumption. </p> <p>What happened next is history too recent to need recounting here, suffice to say United in general and Roy Keane in particular seized the moment and delivered what Zinedine Zidane still describes as the greatest shock of his life. Chelsea do not possess a Keane, which could tell against them should they manage to reach a final against United, but what they do possess is a core of quality players who are not encumbered by English inferiority and have no inclination to be intimidated by Barcelona's reputation. </p> <p>Chelsea are capable of defending a two-goal lead in the Nou Camp, though Vialli is probably right in thinking that may not be the best way to go about it. Valencia tried the defensive approach in a league match last weekend and were overrun 3-0, although only after Van Gaal had introduced Jari Litmanen for central defender Abelardo after a goalless first half. He did the same thing at half-time on Wednesday, removing wing-back Carlos Puyol and shoving Litmanen into midfield. Though few other managers would bring on a former striker at 3-0 down, there was some substance to Van Gaal's claim that Barcelona had won the second half. It is difficult to see precisely what the sadly diminished Litmanen brings to an attack that already boasts three of the most exciting forwards in Europe, but there is no mystery as to why Van Gaal keeps pulling off his defenders. </p> <p>Barcelona's defence did not distinguish itself at Stamford Bridge, with Abelardo isolated and Frank de Boer unable to patrol the huge expanses of space that opened up behind Barcelona's back line. Chelsea's second goal must have been a real treat for Nou Camp reject Albert Ferrer, who not only won the ball in an advanced midfield position but played Gianfranco Zola behind the defence to cross for Tore Andre Flo. </p> <p>It will be interesting to see what kind of reception the reluctant departee receives on his return to Barcelona, particularly if his replacements allow Chelsea similar amounts of space. Vialli knows the best hope is to attack what seems a far-from-impregnable Barcelona defence, or at least that is what he is saying. Carrying the proposition through, if an early goal is conceded is the tricky thing. Manchester United had their backs to the wall in Turin last year, they attacked because they had nothing to lose. Chelsea have to try to protect a lead without actually sitting on it, in one of the world's most intimidating stadiums. If they manage that, they will have well and truly arrived in Europe. </p> <p>Then they can compare notes with United, and work out what to do when the biggest stadiums in Spain are no longer intimidating. The Bernabeu did its best on Tuesday, but it wasn't full, it wasn't hostile, and it wasn't even particularly noisy. Watching the fitful Real Madrid it was not difficult to understand why, but even the United fans were struck by the ordinariness of the atmosphere. The gist of a conversation with a group of Mancunians on the Metro after the game was that budgetary considerations may restrict future excursions to second legs only, if first legs are going to be such inconclusive reminders of the group phase. </p> <p>The United supporters stopped short of saying they wished Real had scored to make a scrap of it, but there is little doubt adversity brings out the best in Ferguson's players. Ask any of the teams who have scored first against United this season only to be buried by an avalanche. Of course you could say Ferguson's management technique gives players most of the adversity they need, hence the caustic comments designed to produce an effect in the next leg. But it was faintly worrying to see United fail to live up to their reputation. Giggs and David Beckham were low key, Andy Cole missed his big chance, Dwight Yorke barely figured, and, most conspicuous of all, Keane, visibly constrained by fear of picking up a caution, failed to impose his presence. </p> <p>'Was the wolf as fierce as you had expected?' a surprised Vicente del Bosque was asked after the game. The Real manager ducked the question, partly because it was rhetorical and partly because Ferguson had already answered it. The psychological warfare never really stops in the Champions League's later stages. United are now the side needing to improve in the second leg, and while that situation may suit them, the mathematics will reward an attacking display by their visitors. Real like to attack, and with Nicolas Anelka waiting in the wings and Steve McManaman at least assured of his ability to rattle Denis Irwin, the seven-time winners need not quiver in fear at Old Trafford.</p>",

I thought he did a thoroughly decent job of it but as he hasn't 'played the game' we had to have someone who has to chip in with the inane and obvious. So step forward Big Ron. 'The game has come to life', 'very much cat and mouse here', 'the game's gone up two gears in the last three minutes' and when Zola scored such incisive analysis as 'Brilliant... gets it up over the wall... gets it up and down with pace.'

      "byline": "Amy Lawrence",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was an average Sunday afternoon. Semi-comatose on the sofa, half an eye on the Italian football on television. It was AC Milan versus Verona, nothing special, until with a couple of minutes to go George Weah picked the ball up on the edge of his own penalty box and began to run. And he ran and ran. And he jockeyed and jinked and ran some more. On and on, dummying and dribbling past virtually every single player from the opposition. Weah ran the length of the field to slot home the most brilliant individual goal I ever did see. It inspired the kind of awe that made people fall off their sofas. </p> <p>The Gazetta Dello Sport ran pages of glorifying analysis for days afterwards, proclaiming it was the greatest strike of all in Italian football. Even though he must have been asked about it thousands of times, Weah still relives it with joy that sounds fresh and real. 'When I took the ball,' his voice drops to a dramatic drawl, 'it was like I lose my mind. Somebody kept pushing me, saying \"Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!\" and when I got the final touch...', he smiles to himself, 'I ran into the hands of somebody I never knew. It was a crazy goal, man. When I look at my idols - Pele, Maradona, Beckenbauer, Cruyff - they did a lot of great things. I came into the game and made history too.' </p> <p>History indeed. The unique tale of George Ousmanu Oppong Weah tells of a boy from the riverside in Monrovia, the capital of impoverished, unstable Liberia, who became the best player on the planet. At his peak in 1995 he reigned as world, African and European footballer of the year, a trio of crowns never worn simultaneously before or since. More recently, he was named his continent's player of the century. </p> <p>The most astonishing thing about Weah is that genius on the field and generosity off it come in equal measure. He personally bankrolls his national team. Paying for players to travel to matches, supplying kit, and even offering win bonuses have amounted to tens of thousands of dollars so far. He is his country's best-known ambassador. Back home, they call him King George and adore him so much they wish he will one day become president, even though he wisely keeps a distance from his nation's fragile politics when all parties court him continuously. Helping to promote his country through football is enough of a life mission. </p> <p>It was a cause that drove him from the moment he set foot on European soil, a raw 22-year-old invited to AS Monaco for the princely sum of \u00a312,000 by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Weah made a significant impression from his first day. New team-mates wondered why this guy in African robes was sitting in the dressing-room until he changed into some kit and promptly went out and scored a wonder goal in training. </p> <p>Integration, both sporting and cultural, was a massive challenge, though. The Liberia he had left behind was embroiled in brutal civil war, contact with friends and family was almost impossible, and somehow he had to balance all his disheartening worries against rising footballing ambitions: 'I had to do what I had to do. I decided to be strong and play to better the negative image of my country. People were very devastated at home and I could never forget about my country but for just 90 minutes I could make that sacrifice and do it. </p> <p>'Ars\u00e8ne was very surprised because there was too much pressure and yet I had good games. It made me mentally so strong that I could deal with the problems and try to advance my career in a positive sense. </p> <p>'I remember Ars\u00e8ne kept telling me, \"You can be a great player, you can be the best in the world\". I thought he was talking stupid. But I'll always keep trying, I'm telling you. Then came a time when my career was improving and I thought Ars\u00e8ne might be right.' He would later repay his guru coach by giving Wenger his World Player of the Year trophy. 'What can I pay him? I can't give him cash because he makes money. And money can go but the trophy will stay, to remind him what he did for a player.' </p> <p>Weah won leagues, cups and admirers in France before doing the same among the cream in Italy. Moving from Monaco via Paris St Germain (where he was so revered he was nicknamed Paris St George) to the mighty Milan, Serie A took him on to a new plane. Weah made such a dazzling impression at the San Siro, observers suggested he was heir to the great Marco Van Basten. </p> <p>His reputation soared, only to dip when coach Alberto Zaccheroni restricted him to the wing. This season, with faith pinned on young strikers Andreii Shevchenko and Jose Mari, Weah was shunted even further aside, effectively told he could stay on the bench or was free to leave. Their policy has clearly hurt him. </p> <p>'The day I left Milan the dream was over for me,' he says, solemnly. 'They took a decision and that was it. It was final. I haven't been back for two months and now I'm just waiting for the season to finish so I can go back and get my stuff out of there. I can't see myself wearing the Milan shirt again.' Hence he finds himself alongside fellow Serie A exiles currently enjoying life in west London, with Vialli, Zola, Desailly, Deschamps et al, on loan until the end of the season. </p> <p>Watching Chelsea trounce Barcelona from the sidelines last week was a little weird, but also warmed his soul. 'I am involved somehow because I this is my club now. Everything I do I do for the club. Everything I wish for I wish for the club.' Although he is Cup-tied from the Champions League he can play in the FA Cup and is thrilled at the prospect. 'It's true I've done great things but the only way I can do more is play in the FA Cup final. It would be another honour to add to my career. I pray to God that everything goes well, that Chelsea makes the final, and tries to win.' </p> <p>All his career so far he has entrusted to God's will. He asked for help throughout those difficult early days at Monaco. He prayed in the centre circle before the game that brought that goal against Verona. He accepts everything he has gained and some things he hasn't - the World Cup for instance - as his lot. 'If life was set for me not to play in a World Cup I would never play,' he explains. 'Anyway a lot of players play in World Cups but don't have what I have from football.' </p> <p>He would have been a telephone technician in Monrovia were it not for his gifted feet. He fondly remembers the first taste of success, for Young Survivor of Claretown, with whom he won Liberia's third division at 16 years old. 'Survivors was like friends meeting together every day,' he grins. 'The game was so innocent, so enjoyable, you never wanted to leave. But I needed to see better things. Out there.' </p> <p>He keeps his roots with him always.

      "bodyText": "It was an average Sunday afternoon. Semi-comatose on the sofa, half an eye on the Italian football on television. It was AC Milan versus Verona, nothing special, until with a couple of minutes to go George Weah picked the ball up on the edge of his own penalty box and began to run. And he ran and ran. And he jockeyed and jinked and ran some more. On and on, dummying and dribbling past virtually every single player from the opposition. Weah ran the length of the field to slot home the most brilliant individual goal I ever did see. It inspired the kind of awe that made people fall off their sofas. The Gazetta Dello Sport ran pages of glorifying analysis for days afterwards, proclaiming it was the greatest strike of all in Italian football. Even though he must have been asked about it thousands of times, Weah still relives it with joy that sounds fresh and real. 'When I took the ball,' his voice drops to a dramatic drawl, 'it was like I lose my mind. Somebody kept pushing me, saying \"Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!\" and when I got the final touch...', he smiles to himself, 'I ran into the hands of somebody I never knew. It was a crazy goal, man. When I look at my idols - Pele, Maradona, Beckenbauer, Cruyff - they did a lot of great things. I came into the game and made history too.' History indeed. The unique tale of George Ousmanu Oppong Weah tells of a boy from the riverside in Monrovia, the capital of impoverished, unstable Liberia, who became the best player on the planet. At his peak in 1995 he reigned as world, African and European footballer of the year, a trio of crowns never worn simultaneously before or since. More recently, he was named his continent's player of the century. The most astonishing thing about Weah is that genius on the field and generosity off it come in equal measure. He personally bankrolls his national team. Paying for players to travel to matches, supplying kit, and even offering win bonuses have amounted to tens of thousands of dollars so far. He is his country's best-known ambassador. Back home, they call him King George and adore him so much they wish he will one day become president, even though he wisely keeps a distance from his nation's fragile politics when all parties court him continuously. Helping to promote his country through football is enough of a life mission. It was a cause that drove him from the moment he set foot on European soil, a raw 22-year-old invited to AS Monaco for the princely sum of \u00a312,000 by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Weah made a significant impression from his first day. New team-mates wondered why this guy in African robes was sitting in the dressing-room until he changed into some kit and promptly went out and scored a wonder goal in training. Integration, both sporting and cultural, was a massive challenge, though. The Liberia he had left behind was embroiled in brutal civil war, contact with friends and family was almost impossible, and somehow he had to balance all his disheartening worries against rising footballing ambitions: 'I had to do what I had to do. I decided to be strong and play to better the negative image of my country. People were very devastated at home and I could never forget about my country but for just 90 minutes I could make that sacrifice and do it. 'Ars\u00e8ne was very surprised because there was too much pressure and yet I had good games. It made me mentally so strong that I could deal with the problems and try to advance my career in a positive sense. 'I remember Ars\u00e8ne kept telling me, \"You can be a great player, you can be the best in the world\". I thought he was talking stupid. But I'll always keep trying, I'm telling you. Then came a time when my career was improving and I thought Ars\u00e8ne might be right.' He would later repay his guru coach by giving Wenger his World Player of the Year trophy. 'What can I pay him? I can't give him cash because he makes money. And money can go but the trophy will stay, to remind him what he did for a player.' Weah won leagues, cups and admirers in France before doing the same among the cream in Italy. Moving from Monaco via Paris St Germain (where he was so revered he was nicknamed Paris St George) to the mighty Milan, Serie A took him on to a new plane. Weah made such a dazzling impression at the San Siro, observers suggested he was heir to the great Marco Van Basten. His reputation soared, only to dip when coach Alberto Zaccheroni restricted him to the wing. This season, with faith pinned on young strikers Andreii Shevchenko and Jose Mari, Weah was shunted even further aside, effectively told he could stay on the bench or was free to leave. Their policy has clearly hurt him. 'The day I left Milan the dream was over for me,' he says, solemnly. 'They took a decision and that was it. It was final. I haven't been back for two months and now I'm just waiting for the season to finish so I can go back and get my stuff out of there. I can't see myself wearing the Milan shirt again.' Hence he finds himself alongside fellow Serie A exiles currently enjoying life in west London, with Vialli, Zola, Desailly, Deschamps et al, on loan until the end of the season. Watching Chelsea trounce Barcelona from the sidelines last week was a little weird, but also warmed his soul. 'I am involved somehow because I this is my club now. Everything I do I do for the club. Everything I wish for I wish for the club.' Although he is Cup-tied from the Champions League he can play in the FA Cup and is thrilled at the prospect. 'It's true I've done great things but the only way I can do more is play in the FA Cup final. It would be another honour to add to my career. I pray to God that everything goes well, that Chelsea makes the final, and tries to win.' All his career so far he has entrusted to God's will. He asked for help throughout those difficult early days at Monaco. He prayed in the centre circle before the game that brought that goal against Verona. He accepts everything he has gained and some things he hasn't - the World Cup for instance - as his lot. 'If life was set for me not to play in a World Cup I would never play,' he explains. 'Anyway a lot of players play in World Cups but don't have what I have from football.' He would have been a telephone technician in Monrovia were it not for his gifted feet. He fondly remembers the first taste of success, for Young Survivor of Claretown, with whom he won Liberia's third division at 16 years old. 'Survivors was like friends meeting together every day,' he grins. 'The game was so innocent, so enjoyable, you never wanted to leave. But I needed to see better things. Out there.' He keeps his roots with him always. The gold watch reflecting a footballer's lifestyle is partly obscured by plastic and cotton bracelets carrying the red, yellow, green and black colours of home - the kind that cost a few pence at a roadside market. 'To participate in bringing Africa and Europe together in terms of football makes me very happy. We have created some spaces for African soccer. We have made African football respected. We have the talent, it's just a case of teaching the disciplines and providing the facilities and I want to stay in the limelight after my career to help other people progress.' He wants to continue playing in Europe until 2001 or 2002, perhaps staying in England or returning to Italy (but not Milan, he insists, pondering instead the prospect of AS Roma). Then he aims to play his twilight years in the USA. It will be the closing chapter of one of football's most inspiring odysseys.",

      "body": "<p><strong>TV rights: Microsoft v Murdoch</strong><br> The world's richest man, Bill Gates, may try and grab the rights to live Premiership football from Rupert Murdoch. There is talk within the television industry that computer giants Microsoft, Gates's company, will make a \u00a32 billion offer to replace Sky as the broadcaster of live games when the Premier League's existing deal expires next summer. A letter containing details of Microsoft's offer is thought to have been delivered to the League's London headquarters in the fortnight before last Monday's meeting of the 20 club chairmen to thrash out what they wanted in the next TV deal. In addition, senior Microsoft executives are believed to have met league officials for informal discussions twice this year on business trips to Britain from Seattle. Until now observers assumed Microsoft would stage a joint bid for the live match rights with cable firm NTL, in which it has a 5% stake. But now it appears they might go it alone - though a Microsoft spokeswoman said any talk of Gates getting involved was 'speculation'. Could it all just be a plot by the Premier League to talk up the price before their decision in June? </p> <p><strong>United go back to the classroom</strong><br> David Beckham may famously have no GCSEs, but that hasn't stopped him being lined up to attend and promote the forthcoming launch of Manchester United's study support centre educational initiative. The idea is that local youngsters will be encouraged to do extra tuition after school, especially in core numeracy and literacy skills, in classrooms at Old Trafford. Presumably Roy Keane's wages and Sir Alex Ferguson's occasional angry outbursts can be used as subjects for discussion during those lessons. United see the initiative, called Playing For Success, as a way of putting something back into the local community. Other clubs such as Middlesbrough already run similar schemes. Sir Alex will also attend the unveiling, as will Education Secretary David Blunkett, a keen Sheffield Wednesday fan who is probably already trying to work out how many First Division games his team will need to win next season before they can return to the Premiership. </p> <p><strong>Power to the people </strong></p> <p>After decades of fleecing them, ignoring them and taking them for granted, are football clubs finally starting to take their fans seriously? First Newcastle United hired Rogan Taylor, the ex-Football Supporters Association chairman, to advise them how to win back the Toon Army's respect after a series of PR blunders. Then outgoing chairman, Freddie Fletcher, last week apologised to supporters for recent unspecified 'mistakes'. (The Keegan/ Dalglish/Gullit fiascos? Freddie Shepherd and Douglas Hall's jibes about 'ugly' local lasses and overpriced replica shirts? Or the 4,000 bond-holders evicted to make way for corporate clients?) Now Everton have appointed ex-player Joe Parkinson (above) as their first Fans Liaison Officer. The fiery midfielder, forced to retire recently because of a serious knee injury, is already wooing the Goodison faithful by promising to give his mobile phone number to any fan who asks. 'We think this is a unique move,' explains Everton's Alan Myers. 'Joe will deal with fans' complaints, queries and concerns. He'll ask real Evertonians what they want and then relay that to the board.' A new quarterly fans' forum, where players, boss Walter Smith and even club directors will answer questions, is also in the pipeline. </p> <p><strong>Stan the new man</strong><br></p> <p>Maybe he's just desperate for some positive publicity after his 'depression', fire-extinguisher antics in La Manga and attack on Ulrika Jonsson, or has turned over a new leaf, but Stan Collymore ignored the fact of a broken ankle to attend a big reception last week - albeit mostly sitting down - to show sport's support for the NSPCC's anti-child abuse Full Stop campaign. He stuck to orange juice as he and stars such as Alan Shearer, Rio Ferdinand and Will Carling enjoyed the hospitality at St James's Palace and waited for their chance to meet Prince Andrew, who gave a surprisingly eloquent and insightful speech.

Presumably Roy Keane's wages and Sir Alex Ferguson's occasional angry outbursts can be used as subjects for discussion during those lessons. United see the initiative, called Playing For Success, as a way of putting something back into the local community. Other clubs such as Middlesbrough already run similar schemes. Sir Alex will also attend the unveiling, as will Education Secretary David Blunkett, a keen Sheffield Wednesday fan who is probably already trying to work out how many First Division games his team will need to win next season before they can return to the Premiership. Power to the people After decades of fleecing them, ignoring them and taking them for granted, are football clubs finally starting to take their fans seriously? First Newcastle United hired Rogan Taylor, the ex-Football Supporters Association chairman, to advise them how to win back the Toon Army's respect after a series of PR blunders. Then outgoing chairman, Freddie Fletcher, last week apologised to supporters for recent unspecified 'mistakes'. (The Keegan/ Dalglish/Gullit fiascos? Freddie Shepherd and Douglas Hall's jibes about 'ugly' local lasses and overpriced replica shirts? Or the 4,000 bond-holders evicted to make way for corporate clients?) Now Everton have appointed ex-player Joe Parkinson (above) as their first Fans Liaison Officer. The fiery midfielder, forced to retire recently because of a serious knee injury, is already wooing the Goodison faithful by promising to give his mobile phone number to any fan who asks. 'We think this is a unique move,' explains Everton's Alan Myers. 'Joe will deal with fans' complaints, queries and concerns. He'll ask real Evertonians what they want and then relay that to the board.' A new quarterly fans' forum, where players, boss Walter Smith and even club directors will answer questions, is also in the pipeline. Stan the new man Maybe he's just desperate for some positive publicity after his 'depression', fire-extinguisher antics in La Manga and attack on Ulrika Jonsson, or has turned over a new leaf, but Stan Collymore ignored the fact of a broken ankle to attend a big reception last week - albeit mostly sitting down - to show sport's support for the NSPCC's anti-child abuse Full Stop campaign. He stuck to orange juice as he and stars such as Alan Shearer, Rio Ferdinand and Will Carling enjoyed the hospitality at St James's Palace and waited for their chance to meet Prince Andrew, who gave a surprisingly eloquent and insightful speech.

      "body": "<p><strong> Euro 2000: Stripping at the border</strong> </p> <p>Inspired by Belgian plans to turn Charleroi garages into prison cells for Euro 2000, Dutch authorities last week announced a new proposal to forceably undress visiting supporters at the border. The plan, revealed by J de Waard of the Hague's Justice department, is aimed at uncovering suspicious looking tattoos. 'A club tattoo could serve as a unique earmark to identify violence seekers,' de Waard told Dutch paper De Telegraaf . He also plans to strip pubs of all objects that could be used for any form of violence - pool cues, glasses, tables and chairs. Following reports that hotel rates are going up by between 50 and 200 per cent for the tournament, it'll be a testing summer - after you've been stripped, you'll be fleeced. </p> <p> <strong> Blatter: Maradona is respected</strong> </p> <p>Fifa president Sepp Blatter has revealed that he wants to give ailing Diego Maradona a job with soccer's governing body. </p> <p>'Maradona is respected worldwide and could do many things with us, just like Michel Platini and Franz Beckenbauer,' Blatter said before watching Argentina play Chile last week. 'I have been in touch with Diego and plan to have a meeting in the near future. We will only talk about the future and we will leave the past behind.' Which is probably a good thing: 10 years ago Fifa were calling Maradona 'stupid' after he accused president Joao Havelange of leading a plot to drive him out of the game. 'Everybody knows that Havelange is a friend of President Menem [of Argentina],' Maradona said in 1990. 'They want to chop my legs off. So I'm off out of here. Fifa have beaten me over the head without any compunction. My soul is broken. They cut my legs off when I had a chance to recover.' So what chance of forgiveness and a link up with Blatter? No comment from Cuba. </p> <p> <strong> Cold Lazarus: begging for an appeal</strong> </p> <p>Len Lazarus, the football accountant who managed the affairs of Chris Waddle, has been landed with a million-pound bill by a French court, accused of embezzlement. </p> <p>The conviction relates to Waddle's \u00a34.25m transfer from Spurs to Marseille 11 years ago. In addition to a \u00a310,000 fine and a one-year suspended jail sentence, Lazarus has been ordered to repay part of the \u00a31.3m illegally diverted by former Marseille employees into Waddle's account. </p> <p>The offence came to light when corruption charges against former president Bernard Tapie were investigated. That inquiry uncovered misconduct on a massive scale, including the setting-up of a slush fund, fed by phony invoices, to bribe referees. It also discovered a secret network of companies through which Marseille were able to make covert payments to players. </p> <p>The court has ruled that the \u00a31.3m involved in the case must be repaid to the administrator in charge of the liquidation of Marseille at the time - leaving Lazarus in serious financial trouble. Speaking at his London office on Friday, Lazarus told us: 'I was not present for the case, but I have appealed against the decision - that's all you need to know.' </p> <p> <strong> Airdrie in bin kick horror</strong> </p> <p>Airdries star Paul Jack has apologised to Livingston groundsman Andy Forrest for mistaking him for a bin. </p> <p>The incident happened last week when the defender was sent off at Almondvale during the 3-2 defeat by the home side . As Jack left the field, his frustration boiled over and he aimed a kick at a bin - which turned out to be the groundsman. 'I saw out of the corner of my eye that he was about to kick something and the next thing I knew, I was in agony,' said groundsman Forrest. 'But he apologised saying that he was trying to kick a waste-paper bin. That is the end of it as far as I'm concerned.' </p> <p> <strong> 'Kick Mellor out' latest</strong> </p> <p>A new batch of anti-David Mellor shirts has been produced after the existing stock of hundreds sold out last week - comforting news for BBC production staff on Mellor's 5 Live programme who have, we hear, been keen to snap them up.

      "bodyText": "Euro 2000: Stripping at the border Inspired by Belgian plans to turn Charleroi garages into prison cells for Euro 2000, Dutch authorities last week announced a new proposal to forceably undress visiting supporters at the border. The plan, revealed by J de Waard of the Hague's Justice department, is aimed at uncovering suspicious looking tattoos. 'A club tattoo could serve as a unique earmark to identify violence seekers,' de Waard told Dutch paper De Telegraaf . He also plans to strip pubs of all objects that could be used for any form of violence - pool cues, glasses, tables and chairs. Following reports that hotel rates are going up by between 50 and 200 per cent for the tournament, it'll be a testing summer - after you've been stripped, you'll be fleeced. Blatter: Maradona is respected Fifa president Sepp Blatter has revealed that he wants to give ailing Diego Maradona a job with soccer's governing body. 'Maradona is respected worldwide and could do many things with us, just like Michel Platini and Franz Beckenbauer,' Blatter said before watching Argentina play Chile last week. 'I have been in touch with Diego and plan to have a meeting in the near future. We will only talk about the future and we will leave the past behind.' Which is probably a good thing: 10 years ago Fifa were calling Maradona 'stupid' after he accused president Joao Havelange of leading a plot to drive him out of the game. 'Everybody knows that Havelange is a friend of President Menem [of Argentina],' Maradona said in 1990. 'They want to chop my legs off. So I'm off out of here. Fifa have beaten me over the head without any compunction. My soul is broken. They cut my legs off when I had a chance to recover.' So what chance of forgiveness and a link up with Blatter? No comment from Cuba. Cold Lazarus: begging for an appeal Len Lazarus, the football accountant who managed the affairs of Chris Waddle, has been landed with a million-pound bill by a French court, accused of embezzlement. The conviction relates to Waddle's \u00a34.25m transfer from Spurs to Marseille 11 years ago. In addition to a \u00a310,000 fine and a one-year suspended jail sentence, Lazarus has been ordered to repay part of the \u00a31.3m illegally diverted by former Marseille employees into Waddle's account. The offence came to light when corruption charges against former president Bernard Tapie were investigated. That inquiry uncovered misconduct on a massive scale, including the setting-up of a slush fund, fed by phony invoices, to bribe referees. It also discovered a secret network of companies through which Marseille were able to make covert payments to players. The court has ruled that the \u00a31.3m involved in the case must be repaid to the administrator in charge of the liquidation of Marseille at the time - leaving Lazarus in serious financial trouble. Speaking at his London office on Friday, Lazarus told us: 'I was not present for the case, but I have appealed against the decision - that's all you need to know.' Airdrie in bin kick horror Airdries star Paul Jack has apologised to Livingston groundsman Andy Forrest for mistaking him for a bin. The incident happened last week when the defender was sent off at Almondvale during the 3-2 defeat by the home side . As Jack left the field, his frustration boiled over and he aimed a kick at a bin - which turned out to be the groundsman. 'I saw out of the corner of my eye that he was about to kick something and the next thing I knew, I was in agony,' said groundsman Forrest. 'But he apologised saying that he was trying to kick a waste-paper bin. That is the end of it as far as I'm concerned.' 'Kick Mellor out' latest A new batch of anti-David Mellor shirts has been produced after the existing stock of hundreds sold out last week - comforting news for BBC production staff on Mellor's 5 Live programme who have, we hear, been keen to snap them up. To buy yours for \u00a39 email cp_prods@yahoo.com. Sales have helped push the Crystal Palace Supporters Trust funds past \u00a31m. Competition - the winners \u00a350 VIP soccer betting accounts go to: Dorothy Benzie (Aberdeen), Leon Gore (London), Jackie Harris (Gateshead), M Thiyagalingam (London), R Oakley (St Albans), Ian Dickinson (Oldham), K Ajid (Surrey), Paul Kayley (London), Dermot Murphy (Sheffield), and Nick Wright (Devon).

Mr McClement denied that the site would become a 'whingers charter'. 'We are aware that the site could cause concern but we want to provide a public service,' he said. He also believed that libel need not be a problem despite the recent successful action against Internet service provider Demon. 'We will act if a problem is identified,' he said. Complaints will not, however, be vetted. The site will have a database about how to pursue a complaint and law firms specialising in holiday complaints will be encouraged to advertise. This will be the obvious source of revenue for the site. Keith Betton, head of corporate affairs at the Association of British Travel Agents, said: 'We have a tried and tested procedure for complaints. Not only does it work but it is approved by the DTI. Some 80 per cent of people who go through the Abta arbitration scheme win their case.' Sue Ockwell, spokeswoman for the Association of Independent Tour Operators, said: 'Our advice to holidaymakers is to research your holiday well. We encourage consumers to talk to their tour operator before booking. My worry about a complaints website would be that spurious complaints could be posted which could mislead customers.'",

Luke Beckett did find the net but the whistle had already gone for offside.

      "body": "<p> Early in 1999, Stephen Frears made a prediction. 'I imagine in a year's time I'll be reeling under the blows,' he told me one cold afternoon in London members' club Soho House. The 'crime' Frears anticipated was taking Nick Hornby's hugely popular novel High Fidelity and turning it into a film - or, more specifically, an American movie. Not set in Hornby's north London stamping ground, but in Chicago, and starring John Cusack. </p> <p>Surely the record shop-owning, commitment-phobic hero was a product of a very specific time and place? And only a certain kind of British male could get obsessive about the catalogue numbers of records made 30 years before by soul singers who were never famous in their own time? The appeal of the book might have been surprisingly universal, but it got its strength from being grounded in real life: Hornby had so barely fictionalised the world around him, it couldn't help ringing true. </p> <p>People didn't just admire or enjoy the book, they loved it. Hornby sounds less like an author crafting a novel than one of your funnier friends writing you a letter. He says that people are always coming up to him saying something along the lines of 'that character in your book - that's me'. Offend the people who loved the book, and you're struggling to find an audience for the film, especially when it's a book as short on plot and long on atmosphere as High Fidelity. </p> <p>That day last year, the Stanley &amp; Iris precedent was hovering. It is hard not to think of the Comic Strip's Strike ('Al Pacino is Arthur Scargill!') when you hear the story of how Pat Barker's novel Union Street, about working-class illiteracy in the North, was shifted to the States and turned into a film starring Robert De Niro and Jane Fonda. </p> <p>But it is sadder than that: Stanley &amp; Iris wasn't Hollywood at its most crass. Rather, the film was a painfully well-intentioned project directed by Martin Ritt, the man behind Hud and Norma Rae. But the moment the perfectly tanned and toned Fonda steps on the screen the credibility vanishes. Neither the Ken Loach film it could have been, nor the glossy Hollywood transformation the casting threatened, Stanley &amp; Iris sank mid-Atlantic. </p> <p>Frears was aware of the potential flaws of High Fidelity, the movie. 'Well, it won't be about English society. But it will be about a man at that moment in his life. But I can see it won't be about the Holloway Road.' He stopped, then started again. 'In fact, Chicago is rather like the Holloway Road: it's a working-class town. Most people seem to me to be brought up in a rather repressed way, whether in Chicago or the Holloway Road, so that doesn't seem to be a loss. In other words, when I was asked to make it I was a sceptical as anyone is. Changed my mind. When I read it I was just astonished that the transposition is so invisible. The boys who have written it are as loopy about music as Nick is.' </p> <p>The backlash may yet come, when the film reaches England and has to face the kind of obsessives that Hornby writes about - the people who used to go to Wendy May's Locomotion, the Kentish Town club night easy to spot under the flimsy fictional veneer in the book, the people who refuse to accept that the Caledonian Road and Chicago really are interchangeable. But for now, Frears can bask in the reviews that came in as the film opened in the US last week. The Wall Street Journal called it 'an infallibly funny tour de force, the equivalent of a one-man show within a fully populated feature film, and you can't take your eyes off Mr Cusack's doleful face'.The other US reviews have almost all been glowing. The box-office figures have been good, too: not blockbuster-big, but the solid opening that will build with word of mouth and good reviews. </p> <p> Before you start to wonder how something that looked so wrong went so right, let's think about the film in another way. Forget Nick Hornby for a moment. High Fidelity the movie was written by Cusack, D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink, the team behind the wonderful Grosse Pointe Blank (1997). And although that film is about a world-class assassin, it is also about hitting your thirties, fear of commitment, finding out whether you can go back to your past, and wallowing in the soundtrack of your youth. As a one-line pitch, High Fidelity is ' Grosse Pointe Blank without the guns'. </p> <p>The other screenwriter contributing to the film was Scott Rosenberg, who makes his living working on Jerry Bruckheimer action films ( Con Air, Armageddon ) but who wrote Beautiful Girls, another masterpiece of the high school reunion/terror of marriage genre. Looked at like this, the decision to make High Fidelity seems safe as houses. </p> <p>Faced with a book with little plot, where the narrator's voice is all-important, the writers came to the same conclusion as Mary Harron and Guin Turner, the adapters of American Psycho : stick chunks of the text in the film. So High Fidelity is packed with moments when John Cusack turns to the camera and reels off the list of songs he wants played at his funeral, or his top five break-ups. In terms of pure cinema, it might be an over-used device, grown stale in the 35 years since Alfie . But when the writing is good enough, you can get away with it. 'I never expected it to be so faithful,' Hornby said. 'At times it appears to be a film in which John Cusack reads my book.' </p> <p>More than anything, this is Cusack's movie. Not just because he is writer/co-producer/star, but because it was custom-made for his persona. Cusack has two modes: acting ( The Grifters, Being John Malkovich ) and 'doing John Cusack'. This persona was born in The Sure Thing (1985), refined in Say Anything (1989), perfected in Gross Pointe Blank and misused in last year's Pushing Tin. Fast-talking, awkward, bright, single-minded and a little thick-skinned. And immensely likeable. Which makes him the perfect fit for Hornby's alter ego Rob in High Fidelity. </p> <p>Stephen Frears loves Cusack, has done ever since they worked together on The Grifters 10 years ago. He goes quite misty-eyed talking about him. 'Of course, I had such a nice time with him before. And he's such an intelligent actor. And such an interesting man. I don't think I could answer it more succinctly than that, I'm just very, very fond of him. I've slightly realised that on The Grifters, because I had these two extraordinary women, I was intoxicated with them. Now I'm concentrating on John. But he's behaving so terrifically.' </p> <p>Interviewing Frears can be a bewildering experience. He stares out the window and keeps talking, wistfully, almost to himself. 'The whole of his family is so extraordinary. Joan is wonderful. So extraordinary. Very, very ordinary. Good people, decent people, not sanctimonious.' </p> <p>In High Fidelity, Cusack pushes his persona on a little. The moral of Hornby's book is there comes a time when you have to learn not to judge people by the contents of their record collection. You reach a point where hanging on to your adolescence becomes unacceptable. Rob has to be both the voice in your head and a bit of a jerk. The film doesn't forget that he can't just be this nice guy. And in this film, the 33-year-old Cusack suddenly looks older: baggier eyes, jowls where there were none before. </p> <p>Along with Cusack comes his repertory company: his sister Joan, Tim Robbins and Lili Taylor. Then there's The Boss. Like Woody Allen's Play It Again, Sam (or True Romance ), High Fidelity uses a device where the hero's narrator materialises to give him advice. Only this time, that really is Bruce Springsteen helping Cusack out. One thing that certainly wouldn't have happened had High Fidelity become a British film. </p> <p>Frears reckons the biggest loss in the translation was a little British 'glumness'. Hornby noticed something else, a shift from the book's soul obsession to the film's jangly guitar bias, running from the Velvet Underground and Love up to Belle And Sebastian. 'One of the things different is the adoration of all things black American,' Hornby explains, 'which is such an English thing. We're great curators of black America. But the filmmakers transferred their sensibility.' </p> <p>Most people here still thinks it sounds like a bad idea. But don't forget, it's much more faithful to the book than the British-made film of Fever Pitch. And considering the gruesome history of British films over the past couple of years, do you really think High Fidelity would have been a better film by being filmed on location in some ungentrified corner of north London, with a cast including Sadie Frost, Keith Allen and that woman from The Vicar Of Dibley? </p> <p><strong>UK books into USA films: the right (and wrong) way to do it</strong></p> <p> <strong> High Fidelity (2000) </strong></p> <p><strong>The book</strong> <br> <strong> What's it all about?</strong> A thirtysomething soul music connoisseur and record shop owner struggles with growing pains and a fractured love life. <br> <strong> Where is it set? </strong> Gloomy north London, just a stone's throw away from Arsenal's football ground. </p> <p><strong>The film </strong> <br> <strong> What's it all about?</strong> A thirtysomething rock music connoisseur and record shop owner struggles with growing pains and a fractured love life. Directed by Stephen Frears. <br> <strong> Where is it set?</strong> Gloomy Chicago, a taxi ride from the Chicago Bulls' basketball stadium. <br> <strong> How faithful is it? </strong> Apart from the location change, the movie recreates Nick Hornby's novel. <br> <strong> What does Nick Hornby,left think? </strong> 'I never expected it to be so faithful. At times it appears to be a film in which John Cusack reads my book... It's a really good movie. All authors should be so lucky.' </p> <p><strong> Stanley &amp; Iris (1990) </strong></p> <p><strong>The book</strong><br> <strong>What's it all about?</strong> Pat Barker's debut novel, Union Street , was an unsentimental chronicle of working-class women. The uncompromising matriarch, Iris, slaps her pregnant 16-year-old daughter, forces her to have a backstreet abortion and then gets rid of the foetus herself. <br> <strong> Where is it set?</strong> In the heart of the industrial North-east, 'a wasteland of decaying streets and partly demolished houses'. </p> <p><strong>The film</strong> <br> <strong> What's it all about? </strong> A syrupy romance between Robert De Niro's illiterate kitchen porter and Jane Fonda's widowed factory worker who still finds time to teach him how to read and write - over an ironing board. Directed by Martin Ritt. <br> <strong> Where is it set?</strong> In Waterbury, Connecticut <br> <strong> How faithful is it? </strong> Barker's grit is turned into feelgood. <br> <strong> What does Pat Barker, right, think? </strong> 'You have no control. The message for the novelist is, if you can't take the consequences, don't sell the rights.' </p> <p>\u0095 High Fidelity is released in the UK in July</p>",

And considering the gruesome history of British films over the past couple of years, do you really think High Fidelity would have been a better film by being filmed on location in some ungentrified corner of north London, with a cast including Sadie Frost, Keith Allen and that woman from The Vicar Of Dibley? UK books into USA films: the right (and wrong) way to do it High Fidelity (2000) The book What's it all about? A thirtysomething soul music connoisseur and record shop owner struggles with growing pains and a fractured love life. Where is it set? Gloomy north London, just a stone's throw away from Arsenal's football ground. The film What's it all about? A thirtysomething rock music connoisseur and record shop owner struggles with growing pains and a fractured love life. Directed by Stephen Frears. Where is it set? Gloomy Chicago, a taxi ride from the Chicago Bulls' basketball stadium. How faithful is it? Apart from the location change, the movie recreates Nick Hornby's novel. What does Nick Hornby,left think? 'I never expected it to be so faithful. At times it appears to be a film in which John Cusack reads my book... It's a really good movie. All authors should be so lucky.' Stanley &amp; Iris (1990) The book What's it all about? Pat Barker's debut novel, Union Street , was an unsentimental chronicle of working-class women. The uncompromising matriarch, Iris, slaps her pregnant 16-year-old daughter, forces her to have a backstreet abortion and then gets rid of the foetus herself. Where is it set? In the heart of the industrial North-east, 'a wasteland of decaying streets and partly demolished houses'. The film What's it all about? A syrupy romance between Robert De Niro's illiterate kitchen porter and Jane Fonda's widowed factory worker who still finds time to teach him how to read and write - over an ironing board. Directed by Martin Ritt. Where is it set? In Waterbury, Connecticut How faithful is it? Barker's grit is turned into feelgood. What does Pat Barker, right, think? 'You have no control. The message for the novelist is, if you can't take the consequences, don't sell the rights.' \u0095 High Fidelity is released in the UK in July",

      "body": "<p>For all his professional years, Imran Khan has juggled a macho, post-colonial Westernisation with the duties of a nagging Islamic orthodoxy. Last week, his personal accommodation between two cultures tumbled to the ground. His wife Jemima - daughter of the late Sir James Goldsmith - broke her silence on the complexities of her high-profile mixed- race marriage in a Vanity Fair interview. And all the East vs West clich\u00e9s spilled back on to the coffee table. </p> <p>Khan occupies a unique space within the Anglo-Asian maelstrom. He is the charismatic, bullish figure who once seemed to benefit from his alliance with both cultures. Wide-eyed and convincing, he colourfully combined the role of charming sportsman with the strictures of the Koran. In recent years, however, his private life has overshadowed any other contribution he has made. A paternity suit by a former girlfriend; his gradual distance from his wife; a political career dislocated from the mainstream. The legend was never deemed to play itself out with such cruelty. </p> <p>Playboy turned stridently religious pulpit politician, Imran Khan is the mercurial by-product of 50 years of Pakistani independence. In a country that exists in a twilight world between fundamentalism and capitalism, Khan is a beguiling contradiction. His looks are the stuff of Fifties' film legends, and for more than 30 years he has played out his life on a very public stage. </p> <p>Now in a country - Britain - that views Islamic fundamentalism (and inter-racial marriages) with suspicion, his reputation is under assault, prompted by his wife's depiction of an occasionally cold and ultra-ambitious husband. The question now is who or what has Imran Khan become? </p> <p>Khan emerged blinking into the half-light of President Zia ul-Haq's morally and religious bankrupt Pakistan - where over 80 per cent of the country lived below the poverty line. An outrageously talented all-rounder, he canonised cricket with a mystic flair for seam bowling. With his cyclone-dried tresses, designer cricket shoes and expertly tailored clothing, the pot-pourri prince was born. </p> <p>The Eighties were a boom-time in Pakistan for the Khan family. The Bhutto dynasty was in political exile, after General Zia had Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto hanged in 1979. But the Khans were traditional allies with the military classes. Martial law had bred a new \u00e9lite, one more closely tied to favouritism. And there was always money in the Khan household. Khan was raised in the lush, leafy Lahore suburb of Zaman Park, itself an area named after his grandfather. Two generations of his family had excelled at cricket before him. Was he ever destined for anything else? </p> <p>Educated in the dusty colonial buildings of Aitchison College in Lahore, he stood out as the school's opening batsman. Then, on the advice of his parents, he left to sit his A-levels at the Royal Grammar School in Worcester, progressing to Keble College, Oxford, where he emerged with a Third. </p> <p>Khan quickly moved up the ranks of his dejected national cricket team in the late-Seventies, emerging, in the mid-Eighties, as its driving force. The rejuvenation of the team was remarkable. Pakistani cricket before Khan, and certainly after him, was marked as a national obsession stained by territorial bickering. Karachi and Lahore are the sport's two strongholds, considered working-class and well-moneyed breeding grounds respectively. The two cities share different political affiliations also. Karachi's slum dwellers are the backbone of the left-leaning Pakistani People's Party, while the Muslim League is the calling card for Lahore's affluent and educated land-owning aristocracy. </p> <p>Yet Khan outstripped all the stereotypes with his impassioned talk of meritocracy and the national cause - a plea he would make later in his reincarnation as a would-be political force. </p> <p>His record was remarkable. In 88 test matches he took 362 wickets with an in-swinging yorker that seemed to redefine the technical game. Khan, to his credit, remodelled the sometimes brilliant but often erratic Pakistani side in his own, Westernised image, an effort that led Pakistan eventually to win the 1992 World Cup in Melbourne after a triumphant effort against England. But he did not always need cricket as much as Pakistan needed him. When he attempted to retire in 1987 his return was only prompted by an impassioned plea by General Zia shortly before the dictator's death in 1988 in a mysterious plane crash. The story goes that Zia, fresh from the Islamisation of the country that saw hundreds of political opponents jailed, went down on one knee to beg for Khan's return. The pint-sized general - a big wheel in Pakistan cricket - clasped the all-rounder's hand. The cricketing legend only grudgingly agreed to return to the captaincy. </p> <p>But cricket was only ever part of the conundrum that was Imran Khan. There is a Koranic saying: 'O Prophet! Strive hard against the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and be firm against them. Their abode is Hell - an evil refuge.' It's a passage in recent years favoured by Khan. The words are deemed to be his mission statement. </p> <p>It is a line of scripture that nagged at him to rise to greater challenges. One year after winning the World Cup, Khan abruptly chose to disown his playboy past to become Allah's Batsman. Since 1992, he has reinvented himself as a religious puritan, a finger-wagging advocate of truth, justice and village politics. And by all the evidence, the Damascene conversion has proved a personal and political disaster. </p> <p>For most of the early Nineties, he single-handedly managed an international drive for a cancer hospital in Lahore - one dedicated to his mother, who died in 1985. Khan described her passing away as a pivotal moment in his life, one that propelled his conversion to family values and orthodox Islam. But fund-raising for the hospital was marred by allegations from his critics that he was using it as preparation for a political career. Throughout the hospital's construction, Khan denied any designs on joining the political classes. 'This assumption that I want to be Prime Minister is complete nonsense. I don't want to get mixed up with politics,' he said famously in 1995. </p> <p>But his hospital could not possibly contain the runaway aspirations of Khan. A relentless pursuer of new victories, the day-to-day administration of hospital wards was a task beneath him - he felt he had done enough to deliver the structure - leaving the staff to handle the gritty reality. But whatever the reality of his earlier denials of political ambition, Khan's hospital remains a genuine and remarkable achievement. In a country where large sections of the population are excluded from any health care whatever, Khan's commitment to affordable, pioneering medicine has set a precedent. Doctors in Lahore now flock to join the ranks of employees at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust Cancer Hospital. </p> <p>But despite his new-found seriousness, Khan had not completely given up the last vestiges of his playboy lifestyle, which re-emerged when he met his wife, Jemima. The whirlwind wedding in the summer of 1995 held a fascination for readers of the Daily Mail and Hello! magazine. A popular thesis was that Daddy's little girl would tame the wild and flamboyant jet-setting sports star. The reality of the wedding, however, was something different. Jemima would relinquish all financial help from her family, and move to Pakistan. Twenty-one years old, now married to a man of huge ambitions, she threw herself into raising money for his hospital. </p> <p>His friends say Khan never suffered any misgivings about the marriage. He never questioned whether his wife's presence would emerge as a political millstone around his neck. He was wrong. The marriage has armed his rivals with a powerful weapon. In the muck-raking, whisky-drenched world of Pakistani politics, the daughter of the 'half-Jewish, half-Catholic' Sir James is regularly denounced as privy to a Zionist conspiracy in the country. And in his many piques of orthodoxy, Khan has always indicated that he views the marriage as little more than a union of two families. He rarely displays any emotions next to Jemima in public. It is not a characteristic unique to him. Always cold and distant, showing little more than a polite smile for the camera, Khan typifies the lofty self-regard of Pakistan's land-owning classes. Wives are jewels; the influence of their well-connected families is the real trophy. </p> <p>Jemima is expected to fulfil the traditional role of women in Pakistani society, he says. Yet, she hints in the Vanity Fair piece, he casually ignores his role as the breadwinner and father - spending most of his time on the road with political activists. The implication is that for Jemima the marriage has become a crushing life sentence. Six years into their marriage, she has adopted a garment factory as a new hobby, and spends most of her days at home alone. The question now is whether he has replaced the casual sexism of his cricketing days with the men-only enclosure of Pakistani politics. His only serious relationship before Jemima, say his friends, was with his mother. The two were unusually close. Despite the steady succession of models and actresses in his bachelor days none ever lasted more than a few months. Like all good Muslim boys, Khan was always too afraid of offending his mother's sensibilities. </p> <p>Then in 1997, Khan launched his own political party in Pakistan - Tehrike-e-Insaaf. The party was touted as a third political force in the country, but Khan's arrogant and casual dismissal of both the Muslim League and the Pakistani People's Party cost him votes. 'Politicians are corrupt to the core,' he pronounced loftily, although with some reason given the debased nature of Pakistan's political system before last year's military coup. 'They have devoured the wealth of this nation and are thirsting for more.' </p> <p>And, initially, his political career carried a wave of lower-class appeal. The Pakistani press compared him to Muhammad Ali, another sportsman who felt he outgrew his use in the contained arena of physical excellence. But Khan could never galvanise a nation, or an underclass, as succinctly or as poetically as Ali managed to. In the political trenches, Khan's speech is slow and methodical (he has a reluctant grasp of Urdu), carefully chosen at risk of offending. A far cry from Ali's colourful prose. </p> <p>And, at the heart of it, Khan's message espouses a naive ideal. 'We want a revolution,' he has said. 'But we will only work through democratic means. We must clean the place up.' His critics joke that no political field has ever produced a candidate who has ever argued to the contrary. Yet to see Khan pressing the flesh in public is a truly awesome sight - men and women crowd around him wherever he walks. At his hospital, visitors cry as they thank him for helping a loved one with free treatment. Khan, almost always, silently nods and moves on. It's an almost holy passage through the crowd; the God- like sporting legend slumming with the commoners. Why, then, does he choose to muddy his wings in the political slaughterhouse? </p> <p>And his relentless baiting of his rivals has proved a substantial blunder. Pakistani politics are still driven by tribal allegiances to two parties; there is, as yet, no third way. But Khan assumed it his divine right to cast weighty boulders of morality. His political career is now considered a running joke in Pakistan: and embarrassingly, Tehrike-e-Insaaf was unable to win a single seat in 1997's national elections. When his name is mentioned to leading lights of the Muslim League and the Pakistani People's Party, Khan's political future is regarded as an egotistical aberration. His politics are simple, idealistic and unworkable in a country periodically bailed out of chaos only by military regimes, say his critics. </p> <p>Can he reinvent himself one last time, as a loving, patriarchal figure? His friends say he would never retreat back into the folds of his family and consider such an early retirement from politics. He says he never walked off a cricket field in despair. His resolve is strengthened by the fact that he considers himself destined for political greatness. And he has been careful in never committing himself to a timeframe for reaching office. Only three years short of his fiftieth birthday, with a marriage already strained by his own religious ideal, Khan is the epitome of an anachronism caught between two cultures. 'The successful sportsman is the one who never gives up,' he has said of his political failures. And, stumbling between both Eastern and Western cultures, the 'Brown Sahib' has yet to discover one he can completely call his own. </p> <p><strong> Imran Khan</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Born:</strong> 25 November 1952, Lahore, Pakistan </p> <p><strong> Married to:</strong> Jemima Goldsmith (two sons - Suleiyman, Qasim) </p> <p><strong> Education:</strong> Aitchison College, Lahore; Royal Grammar School, Worcester; Keble College, Oxford (third-class degree in politics and economics) </p> <p><strong> Was:</strong> Pakistan cricket all-rounder who in 88 tests took 362 wickets, and who came out of retirement to captain the national team to World Cup victory in 1992 </p> <p><strong> Is:</strong> Leader of the Tehrike-e-Insaaf (For Justice) party in Pakistan </p> <p><strong> Also:</strong> Opened the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust hospital - for the treatment of, and research into, cancer - in memory of his mother, who died of the disease</p>",

And, at the heart of it, Khan's message espouses a naive ideal. 'We want a revolution,' he has said. 'But we will only work through democratic means. We must clean the place up.' His critics joke that no political field has ever produced a candidate who has ever argued to the contrary. Yet to see Khan pressing the flesh in public is a truly awesome sight - men and women crowd around him wherever he walks. At his hospital, visitors cry as they thank him for helping a loved one with free treatment. Khan, almost always, silently nods and moves on. It's an almost holy passage through the crowd; the God- like sporting legend slumming with the commoners. Why, then, does he choose to muddy his wings in the political slaughterhouse? And his relentless baiting of his rivals has proved a substantial blunder. Pakistani politics are still driven by tribal allegiances to two parties; there is, as yet, no third way. But Khan assumed it his divine right to cast weighty boulders of morality. His political career is now considered a running joke in Pakistan: and embarrassingly, Tehrike-e-Insaaf was unable to win a single seat in 1997's national elections. When his name is mentioned to leading lights of the Muslim League and the Pakistani People's Party, Khan's political future is regarded as an egotistical aberration. His politics are simple, idealistic and unworkable in a country periodically bailed out of chaos only by military regimes, say his critics. Can he reinvent himself one last time, as a loving, patriarchal figure? His friends say he would never retreat back into the folds of his family and consider such an early retirement from politics. He says he never walked off a cricket field in despair. His resolve is strengthened by the fact that he considers himself destined for political greatness. And he has been careful in never committing himself to a timeframe for reaching office. Only three years short of his fiftieth birthday, with a marriage already strained by his own religious ideal, Khan is the epitome of an anachronism caught between two cultures. 'The successful sportsman is the one who never gives up,' he has said of his political failures. And, stumbling between both Eastern and Western cultures, the 'Brown Sahib' has yet to discover one he can completely call his own.

Apart from the health risks to mother and child, it can play havoc with carefully laid plans. </p> <p>Career women, such as Cherie Booth, are probably getting to the peak of their earning power and may be unwilling to take a career break or to cut back on working days. Moreover, when Booth's youngest child reaches the age when he or she may want to go on to university, its mother will be 63, an age by which many people hope to have retired. </p> <p>Setting these two expectant mothers aside, as their wealth makes them untypical, anyone contemplating parenthood, perhaps for the first time, in her forties will face complicated financial choices. It may seem a prosaic consideration, but it is worth bearing in mind that a career break can wreck your pension planning: someone who takes off the average of six and a half years to raise a child can retire on a third less than colleagues who do not. </p> <p>If you do take a break, you should re-start and increase your contributions as soon as you can. The alternative is bleak: a recent survey by Lloyds Bank showed that more than half British women - and most of those who take career breaks are women - due to retire in 2003, will receive pensions below the poverty line. </p> <p>Currently, you are not allowed to contribute to a pension - either a company or personal one - unless you are in paid employment. Company pension schemes usually treat statutory maternity leave as pensionable service and expect you to continue your contributions. You can either save a percentage of your statutory maternity pay - and pay less into your pension - or you can carry on with the normal contributions, if you can afford it. If you take longer leave than the statutory minimum, you are not allowed to continue your contributions. </p> <p>The introduction of the stakeholder pension in April next year offers hope to thousands of people who are taking a career break. Not only will the scheme be cheap - the maximum charge is capped at 1 per cent per year - but you will be able to put money aside for your retirement regardless of whether you are in paid employment, and you will still qualify for tax contributions on your highest rate. </p> <p>State support for women who stop work to have a baby is not generous. Statutory maternity pay is only \u00a359.55 a week. One-off 'sure start' grants are available for less well-off families which, with a household income of up to \u00a330,000, may be eligible for the working families' tax credit, but the qualifying rules are complicated. </p> <p>British parents are also lumbered with some of the highest childcare bills in Europe. A late addition to the family of a working woman may mean a return to paying a nanny's salary or nursery or childminder's fees just as older children have begun to fend for themselves. </p> <p>Parents who have spare cash are often keen to save for their children's future. This may be especially true if they are concerned that they will no longer be earning as the child enters adulthood. Banks and building societies offer competitive savings accounts for children. Rates can be more than 6.5 per cent and your children can usually register to have the interest paid before tax. </p> <p>You can also invest in the stock market on behalf of your children. But beware the Inland Revenue rules governing the amount that parents can give to their children. Friends and other relatives are not similarly hampered. </p> <p>You may even wish to consider buying a stakeholder pension for your child as, surprisingly, there is no age limit on who can take one out. Donna Bradshaw of Fiona Price and Partners says that when she has pointed out to parents that the money will be locked up until their child turns 50, their reaction has not been disappointment, but delight. </p> <p><strong>Twin reasons to rethink</strong></p> <p> Sue Douse, who turns 40 in June, had planned to have more children since the birth of her son, Christopher, nine years ago. Unfortunately, she had difficulty conceiving and turned to fertility treatment. The happy result of this was the birth, four and a half months ago, of twin daughters, Annabelle and Samantha. </p> <p>But, however thoroughly thought through, the arrival of children has had a major impact on her finances. Sue, from Surrey, needs to travel a lot in her work as a senior investment consultant. She has recently returned to her job full-time, and realised that she needed a top-class nanny to take care of her three children while she worked. </p> <p>'To do this, the nanny has to be really wonderful,' she says. Such nannies do not come cheap. Also, her new nanny has her hands full with the children, meaning that Sue has had to take on a cleaner. </p> <p>On the plus side, having more children has made her give a bit more time to focusing on her family's finances, rather than just other people's. </p> <p>'I never seemed to have time to sit down and think about it before,' she says. </p> <p>Some of her precious maternity leave was taken up with her financial reorganisation - 'including remortgaging the family home, so that we have a comfortable retirement as well as providing for the children'.</p>",

Company pension schemes usually treat statutory maternity leave as pensionable service and expect you to continue your contributions. You can either save a percentage of your statutory maternity pay - and pay less into your pension - or you can carry on with the normal contributions, if you can afford it. If you take longer leave than the statutory minimum, you are not allowed to continue your contributions. The introduction of the stakeholder pension in April next year offers hope to thousands of people who are taking a career break. Not only will the scheme be cheap - the maximum charge is capped at 1 per cent per year - but you will be able to put money aside for your retirement regardless of whether you are in paid employment, and you will still qualify for tax contributions on your highest rate. State support for women who stop work to have a baby is not generous. Statutory maternity pay is only \u00a359.55 a week. One-off 'sure start' grants are available for less well-off families which, with a household income of up to \u00a330,000, may be eligible for the working families' tax credit, but the qualifying rules are complicated. British parents are also lumbered with some of the highest childcare bills in Europe. A late addition to the family of a working woman may mean a return to paying a nanny's salary or nursery or childminder's fees just as older children have begun to fend for themselves. Parents who have spare cash are often keen to save for their children's future. This may be especially true if they are concerned that they will no longer be earning as the child enters adulthood. Banks and building societies offer competitive savings accounts for children. Rates can be more than 6.5 per cent and your children can usually register to have the interest paid before tax. You can also invest in the stock market on behalf of your children. But beware the Inland Revenue rules governing the amount that parents can give to their children. Friends and other relatives are not similarly hampered. You may even wish to consider buying a stakeholder pension for your child as, surprisingly, there is no age limit on who can take one out. Donna Bradshaw of Fiona Price and Partners says that when she has pointed out to parents that the money will be locked up until their child turns 50, their reaction has not been disappointment, but delight. Twin reasons to rethink Sue Douse, who turns 40 in June, had planned to have more children since the birth of her son, Christopher, nine years ago. Unfortunately, she had difficulty conceiving and turned to fertility treatment. The happy result of this was the birth, four and a half months ago, of twin daughters, Annabelle and Samantha. But, however thoroughly thought through, the arrival of children has had a major impact on her finances. Sue, from Surrey, needs to travel a lot in her work as a senior investment consultant. She has recently returned to her job full-time, and realised that she needed a top-class nanny to take care of her three children while she worked. 'To do this, the nanny has to be really wonderful,' she says. Such nannies do not come cheap. Also, her new nanny has her hands full with the children, meaning that Sue has had to take on a cleaner. On the plus side, having more children has made her give a bit more time to focusing on her family's finances, rather than just other people's. 'I never seemed to have time to sit down and think about it before,' she says. Some of her precious maternity leave was taken up with her financial reorganisation - 'including remortgaging the family home, so that we have a comfortable retirement as well as providing for the children'.",

Splendid examples of restored Elizabethan town houses with three bedrooms are currently valued between \u00a3220,000 and \u00a3350,000. The most prestigious properties are found north of the high street. Victorian and Edwardian houses with five or six bedrooms and at least half an acre of garden are expected to sell for more than \u00a3700,000.",

      "body": "<p><strong> I booked a flight to Kiev through Dial-a-Flight and my credit card was debited \u00a3314. The operator said the flight was confirmed. Two days later, she phoned to say that my flight had been given to somebody else. I had to fly on a different day and this time pay \u00a3360. This caused me much inconvenience as I had already made arrangements with my friends in Kiev. I asked Dial-a-Flight to refund the difference; they passed my letter to the Travel Advice Centre which handles their complaints but my request was rejected.<br>PW, Hinckley </strong> </p> <p>When your complaint was investigated, the operator gave her side of the story: she claims she did not tell you the flight was confirmed but that she would get off the phone to book it; she then found that the flight had gone so she phoned you back. Unless the conversation was recorded, it comes down to your word against hers and it is difficult to unravel this type of dispute. Dial-a-Flight belongs to Abta, which has a chargeable arbitration service to investigate complaints. </p> <p>The Air Transport Users Council gets many calls from travellers who thought they had confirmed flights, only to be disappointed. It says you do not know for certain that you have the flight you want until the tickets arrive stamped 'OK'. </p> <p>But it offers a useful tip: immediately after a travel agent has 'booked' your flight, telephone the airline yourself directly to check if this booking is 'OK' or just 'wait listed'. </p> <p><strong> Home extension: Lofty ideas</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong>We are converting our loft and trying to work out the best way of funding it. The cost is \u00a320,000 and we could extend our mortgage (\u00a365,000 with Abbey National); remortgage with my bank First Direct saving \u00a340 a month; or cash in stock options from my employer.<br>BS, Brighton</strong> </p> <p>Treat your stock options as a medium to long-term investment and borrow the money for the conversion. Mortgage rates are creeping up and the First Direct loan you saw is no longer available. The market is competitive so you should contact both lenders, and possibly more, to negotiate the best deal on fees as well as interest rates. </p> <p>Every option involves charges but often lenders pick up the cost to attract new borrowers. </p> <p>You could take a top-up mortgage with the Abbey or a home improvement loan. There should be no penalty charges to pay off a standard Abbey National loan but you will face a deed handling fee (\u00a385) and a discharge fee (\u00a365). For a new loan, ask about fees for: booking (\u00a3200 to \u00a3300 and non-refundable if you pull out); remortgaging (about \u00a3275); revaluation (about \u00a3225); land registry charges; and conveyancing. With fixed-rate loans, ask if there are penalties for repaying faster than planned. </p> <p><strong> 50-80 policy: Life sentence</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> In 1982, I took out an aged 50 to 80 life policy with Lloyds Life, now Royal &amp; Sun Alliance. The premiums are \u00a324.54 a month. I estimate I have paid well over \u00a35,000 in premiums but the assured sum is only \u00a33,290. I am 84 and will have to continue paying until who knows when. Is there any answer to this?<br>HH, Polegate</strong> </p> <p>The insurer no longer sells this type of whole life policy, although others do. They are marketed to the over-50s, which can make you believe that they are particularly good for older people. The insurer asks no questions about your health, so sick customers pay the same premiums as the vigorous and anyone who dies soon after buying, gets good value. </p> <p>But people who live a long time would have done better to save the money in the bank. You have three options now but none gives you back what you have paid out. </p> <p>You can continue paying the premiums. You can have the policy made paid up, in which case you stop paying premiums; the policy continues in force but is worth only \u00a32,040. Or you can surrender the policy for, at current rates, \u00a31,648. </p> <p><strong> Daily interest: Save the day</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong>My husband and I are negotiating a mortgage with the Halifax and asked about daily versus yearly interest. The bank's representative said she had never heard of daily interest and they certainly did not offer it. Is there any saving from daily interest and are we allowed to insist on this?<br>ED, Milton</strong> </p> <p>Mortgages cost less overall if the interest payments are recalculated daily because every month's repayment reduces the amount you owe and the next month's interest is based on a slightly smaller sum. Mortgage lender First Active says someone borrowing \u00a375,000 at 7.5 per cent for 25 years will pay an extra \u00a33,600 if the interest is calculated only once a year. </p> <p>You have to accept whichever method your lender uses and the Halifax recalculates annually for all borrowers, although it plans a daily-interest loan next June. Presumably the member of staff was in the dark because, while daily interest is widely written about, it is not yet part of her training. </p> <p>\u0095 Write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER and include a telephone number.

Two days later, she phoned to say that my flight had been given to somebody else. I had to fly on a different day and this time pay \u00a3360. This caused me much inconvenience as I had already made arrangements with my friends in Kiev. I asked Dial-a-Flight to refund the difference; they passed my letter to the Travel Advice Centre which handles their complaints but my request was rejected. PW, Hinckley When your complaint was investigated, the operator gave her side of the story: she claims she did not tell you the flight was confirmed but that she would get off the phone to book it; she then found that the flight had gone so she phoned you back. Unless the conversation was recorded, it comes down to your word against hers and it is difficult to unravel this type of dispute. Dial-a-Flight belongs to Abta, which has a chargeable arbitration service to investigate complaints. The Air Transport Users Council gets many calls from travellers who thought they had confirmed flights, only to be disappointed. It says you do not know for certain that you have the flight you want until the tickets arrive stamped 'OK'. But it offers a useful tip: immediately after a travel agent has 'booked' your flight, telephone the airline yourself directly to check if this booking is 'OK' or just 'wait listed'. Home extension: Lofty ideas We are converting our loft and trying to work out the best way of funding it. The cost is \u00a320,000 and we could extend our mortgage (\u00a365,000 with Abbey National); remortgage with my bank First Direct saving \u00a340 a month; or cash in stock options from my employer. BS, Brighton Treat your stock options as a medium to long-term investment and borrow the money for the conversion. Mortgage rates are creeping up and the First Direct loan you saw is no longer available. The market is competitive so you should contact both lenders, and possibly more, to negotiate the best deal on fees as well as interest rates. Every option involves charges but often lenders pick up the cost to attract new borrowers. You could take a top-up mortgage with the Abbey or a home improvement loan. There should be no penalty charges to pay off a standard Abbey National loan but you will face a deed handling fee (\u00a385) and a discharge fee (\u00a365). For a new loan, ask about fees for: booking (\u00a3200 to \u00a3300 and non-refundable if you pull out); remortgaging (about \u00a3275); revaluation (about \u00a3225); land registry charges; and conveyancing. With fixed-rate loans, ask if there are penalties for repaying faster than planned. 50-80 policy: Life sentence In 1982, I took out an aged 50 to 80 life policy with Lloyds Life, now Royal &amp; Sun Alliance. The premiums are \u00a324.54 a month. I estimate I have paid well over \u00a35,000 in premiums but the assured sum is only \u00a33,290. I am 84 and will have to continue paying until who knows when. Is there any answer to this? HH, Polegate The insurer no longer sells this type of whole life policy, although others do. They are marketed to the over-50s, which can make you believe that they are particularly good for older people. The insurer asks no questions about your health, so sick customers pay the same premiums as the vigorous and anyone who dies soon after buying, gets good value. But people who live a long time would have done better to save the money in the bank. You have three options now but none gives you back what you have paid out. You can continue paying the premiums. You can have the policy made paid up, in which case you stop paying premiums; the policy continues in force but is worth only \u00a32,040. Or you can surrender the policy for, at current rates, \u00a31,648. Daily interest: Save the day My husband and I are negotiating a mortgage with the Halifax and asked about daily versus yearly interest. The bank's representative said she had never heard of daily interest and they certainly did not offer it. Is there any saving from daily interest and are we allowed to insist on this? ED, Milton Mortgages cost less overall if the interest payments are recalculated daily because every month's repayment reduces the amount you owe and the next month's interest is based on a slightly smaller sum. Mortgage lender First Active says someone borrowing \u00a375,000 at 7.5 per cent for 25 years will pay an extra \u00a33,600 if the interest is calculated only once a year. You have to accept whichever method your lender uses and the Halifax recalculates annually for all borrowers, although it plans a daily-interest loan next June. Presumably the member of staff was in the dark because, while daily interest is widely written about, it is not yet part of her training. \u0095 Write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER and include a telephone number.

Prospective investors digging for gold among 1,768 unit trusts and Oeics, 300 investment trusts and innumerable pension and life insurance products face a daunting task. </p> <p>There are no prizes for guessing where most of them turn for help: the past performance tables. Investors may read, and even accept the truth of the mantra that 'past performance is no guarantee of future returns', but most still believe performance records are the only readily accessible and reliable guide. </p> <p>Research suggests investors put past performance and a company's reputation at the top of their list when picking a fund. 'It would be considered counter-intuitive to pick a manager with a bad past record, so investors think they are better off by taking the \"safe\" option of picking a manager with a good past performance history,' says actuary and consultant Bacon &amp; Woodrow. So it might seem a tad contrary that the Financial Services Authority, the investment industry's regulator, is proposing that past performance information be excluded from comparative tables, and that Bacon &amp; Woodrow, which supported the production of the FSA's consultation paper on comparative information, heartily endorses this stance.

      "bodyText": "Few things prompt the conflicting emotions of greed, confusion and uncertainty more effectively than a list of investment funds as long as the London telephone directory. Prospective investors digging for gold among 1,768 unit trusts and Oeics, 300 investment trusts and innumerable pension and life insurance products face a daunting task. There are no prizes for guessing where most of them turn for help: the past performance tables. Investors may read, and even accept the truth of the mantra that 'past performance is no guarantee of future returns', but most still believe performance records are the only readily accessible and reliable guide. Research suggests investors put past performance and a company's reputation at the top of their list when picking a fund. 'It would be considered counter-intuitive to pick a manager with a bad past record, so investors think they are better off by taking the \"safe\" option of picking a manager with a good past performance history,' says actuary and consultant Bacon &amp; Woodrow. So it might seem a tad contrary that the Financial Services Authority, the investment industry's regulator, is proposing that past performance information be excluded from comparative tables, and that Bacon &amp; Woodrow, which supported the production of the FSA's consultation paper on comparative information, heartily endorses this stance. Yet Bacon &amp; Woodrow bluntly rejects any notion of perversity. 'The weight of evidence against past performance is overwhelming,' says the company's Andrew Warwick-Thompson.

      "body": "<p>Now is the time to buy prehistoric stone tools, made up to 350,000 years ago. They are being reappraised as art - not just archaeology - and the broader market for them is pushing up prices. </p> <p>The Hollywood image of our Stone Age ancestors as dimwitted, ape-like creatures fades upon seeing a perfectly shaped, smoothed and polished jade axe head made in Britain in the Neolithic (New Stone Age) period, between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago. They are sophisticated objects. </p> <p>Disguised in suits and ties, their makers - settlers, rather than hunter-gatherers - would pass unnoticed in a modern crowd. But even the flint axes and scrapers shaped by beetle-browed Neanderthals in the icy Old Stone Age (Palaeolithic) period, about 150,000 years ago, can be works of consummate skill. </p> <p>The prehistoric stone tools that turn up in scores at London auctions of antiquities or tribal art are sometimes blunted by use or are the botched efforts of Palaeolithic apprentices sweating over the hard, flaky flint. </p> <p>For masterworks in flint, view the British Museum's superb collection, which includes an expertly-fashioned pear-shaped early Palaeolithic hand axe unearthed in 1690 among the bones of a woolly mammoth in Gray's Inn Lane, London. </p> <p>Although a superb Neolithic tool can command \u00a35,000 or so at auction, prices for artless, run-of-the-mill flaked tools are at rock bottom. </p> <p>At Phillips in December a huge lot of 370 prehistoric flint tools, including hide scrapers and knives, collected between 1940 and 1960 by an amateur archaeologist, the late Captain J.A.W. Bate, fetched a paltry \u00a329, in keeping with the pre-sale estimate of \u00a320-\u00a330. </p> <p>In the same saleroom the previous April, however, six flaked Palaeolithic hand axes from the same collection, estimated \u00a3180-\u00a3220 the lot, made \u00a31,725. </p> <p>Two of them carried the magic inscriptions 'Swanscombe 1911' and 'Swanscombe 1921', the name of the famous 'find-spot' in Kent where the earliest British stone tools were found. </p> <p>Tomorrow, at Phillips, you can bid for a collection amassed more than 70 years ago by another amateur archaeologist, Arthur Halcrow Verstage, architect and designer of the famous Blue Plaque. Estimates are modest: a lot of 38 Neolithic stone blades, \u00a3100-\u00a3150, the same estimate as a score of Palaeolithic flint tools, all with 'Swanscombe' labels from archaeologists.' </p> <p>At auction, you may rub shoulders with a mysterious band of 'flint-knappers', connoisseurs of the flaked flint, who might reveal how the tools being auctioned were flaked - the precise angle and strength of the blows. </p> <p>Palaeolithics used a stone anvil upon which the 'core stone', destined to become the finished tool, was struck with a hammer stone. A band of forgers of prehistoric tools? Perish the thought. </p> <p>Chris Martin, a leading dealer in ancient art, says: 'The market has changed over the past five to 10 years. Before, it was mainly the seriously esoteric collectors, fascinated by the type of flint used, and how it was worked. </p> <p>'Latterly, there has been a great move towards appreciation of the aesthetics of simple forms; the style, the colour. These new collectors already collect contemporary art. </p> <p>'They go especially for polished stone axes, but will also buy exquisitely flaked tools. It is an artistic following that is willing to pay artistic prices.' </p> <p>Five or 10 years ago, he says, 'a fine flaked Palaeolithic hand axe would sell for \u00a350-\u00a3150. Now, the same tool would sell for \u00a3500-\u00a31,000. Exceptional specimens sell for \u00a32,000.' </p> <p>He sells average-to-good Palaeolithic flaked hand axes for \u00a3140 each, scrapers and tools from the same period for \u00a325. He also deals in Neolithic polished axes - when he can get them. </p> <p>For minimalist aesthetes, tomorrow's sale at Phillips offers six polished, tapering Neolithic axes, three with a glassy finish. The estimate is \u00a3500-\u00a3800 the lot. </p> <p>These, incidentally, were the sort of stoneware that deforested Britain; ecological correctness was not the Neolithics' strong point. </p> <p>Only three years ago, the demand for polished Neolithic axes was so patchy that one at Bonhams, estimated \u00a33,000-\u00a34,000, failed to sell until a private deal after the auction. The one collector thought capable of paying for it stayed away, fearing that he would be outbid for such a magnificent object. </p> <p>The antiquities dealer James Ede sold half a dozen flint tools at last month's big art and antiques fair in Maastricht, Holland. </p> <p>He deals in London's finest Greek, Roman and Egyptian antiquities, yet is offering a fine, flaked, pear-shaped hand-axe from the middle of the Palaeolithic period (not less than 175,000 years ago), found at Dartford, Kent, for \u00a3350, and a competent oval one from the same period, with the 'Swanscombe' label, for \u00a3120. </p> <p>He says he would never buy prehistoric flints without collectors' labels of provenance. But, label or no label, he can spot a freshly-flaked fake. They have a brighter patina than those that have spent thousands of years in the earth, he says. </p> <p>You can train your eye to spot the difference between a man-made flint tool and the billions of other flints that have been chipped by earth movement over the millenia. </p> <p>Man-made ones, because they are flaked by blows delivered to a point of impact, have a characteristic bulb formed by percussion waves radiating from the point. There are no such bulbs on naturally damaged flints, where force has been more evenly applied. </p> <p>Joanna van de Lande. of Bonhams, reckons that the labels stuck on flint tools by Victorian amateur archaeologists are part of the charm of prehistoric flint tools. They tell the history of collecting. After all, she says, flints and fossils were the first popular collectibles, pre-dating postage stamps. </p> <p>Her sale on 13 April, has some fascinating finds, estimated under \u00a3500, with labels bearing the names of such legendary archaeologists as Louis Leakey, discoverer of early man in Africa. </p> <p>She also offers a third millennium BC Neolithic stone ball, 3in in diameter, with six disc-like sections, estimate \u00a33,000-\u00a34,000. About 350 are known. They are found only in Scotland, but their purpose is a mystery. </p> <p>To me, it's obvious: they were the first golf balls. There are two of them in Christie's South Kensington's sale on Wednesday - estimated \u00a33,000-\u00a35,000 and \u00a31,500-\u00a32,500. </p> <p>Although you may not be lucky enough to trip over a Neolithic golf ball on your rambles, prehistoric flint tools are commoner than you might think. My collector friend explained this as the 'lost trowel' syndrome. We've all come across forgotten, rusted trowels in the garden.

      "body": "<p>An array of luxury extras is being offered by developers to attract buyers to new homes, particularly at the expensive end of the market. Interior designers, luxurious, brand-name fittings and prestigious kitchen appliances may clinch a sale. </p> <p>From the purchasers' point of view, buying somewhere with a fully equipped kitchen, all the appliances in place and high quality flooring throughout can be cost-effective, because the developer deals with suppliers direct and buys in bulk. </p> <p>Nicholson Estates, which specialises in homes in city centres, is going further by offering valet parking to purchasers of apartments at Century Buildings, Manchester. Other 'extras' employed elsewhere have included specially commissioned abstract sculpture and health suites. </p> <p>Sales manager Sasha Liddiard believes valet parking adds little to the overall cost or service charge. 'We had already allowed for 24-hour porterage,' he says. </p> <p>Buyers of the penthouse apartments at Century Buildings also get a bespoke service from the interior design consultancy of Mary Fox Linton, allowing them high individual control over the final specifications and colour schemes. </p> <p>There are Boffi kitchens and Philippe Starck, and hand showers in the bathroom. Nicholson Estates is now deciding whether to add 'steam showers', as two or three prospective purchasers have asked about them. </p> <p>Even more modest apartments - prices start at \u00a3110,000 - are interior designed and contain brand names you would recognise, as well as bamboo flooring, the latest 'must have' for people who may now find more ordinary natural woods a little pass\u00e9 . </p> <p>Liddiard says the other advantage of including luxury extras at the point of property purchase is it reduces the 'hassle factor' for buyers. </p> <p>For those purchasing as an investment, a ready-equipped property can cut the time between purchase and obtaining a rental income. Nicholson estimates that as many as 30 per cent of Century Buildings' purchasers are buying as an investment. </p> <p>The National House Builders' Federation says most firms - not just those at the top end of the market - are happy to do this. A spokesman says: 'Buyers who agree to purchase early are usually in the best position to stipulate their requirements.' </p> <p>Even today's technology may become tomorrow's everyday optional extra. The federation cites Wilcon Homes which has just completed a 'concept house' with a central computer and a changer for 200 CDs in the loft, linked to each room. </p> <p>John Weir, Wilcon's design director, says: 'This is a concept house - not a prototype. All the technology will be cheap enough to fit [to ordinary homes] in two or three years' time, and we will fit it because everyone will want its convenience.' </p> <p>The increasing interest in interior design, fuelled by a plethora of television programmes, has increased the public's desire for homes which look as though they belong on the cover of a glossy magazine. </p> <p>'I suppose the London Docklands market has set the scene and the rest of the country has followed,' said David Parry, new homes and residential developments partner for Cluttons in the South-east. </p> <p>Upmarket new homes that previously boasted three garages may do better these days if they boast four - one with a higher roof than the rest to take a four-wheel drive vehicle - and the doors should open electronically, of course. </p> <p>Power showers, roll top baths, kitchens with granite work surfaces, Shaker-style cabinets and American-style larder fridges are among the other extras that find favour. </p> <p>But Parry warns that avant garde fittings may quickly become unfashionable, and have an impact on the price when the purchaser comes to resell the property. 'Whirlpool baths and limed oak kitchens are already things of the past,' he adds.</p>",

      "bodyText": "An array of luxury extras is being offered by developers to attract buyers to new homes, particularly at the expensive end of the market. Interior designers, luxurious, brand-name fittings and prestigious kitchen appliances may clinch a sale. From the purchasers' point of view, buying somewhere with a fully equipped kitchen, all the appliances in place and high quality flooring throughout can be cost-effective, because the developer deals with suppliers direct and buys in bulk. Nicholson Estates, which specialises in homes in city centres, is going further by offering valet parking to purchasers of apartments at Century Buildings, Manchester. Other 'extras' employed elsewhere have included specially commissioned abstract sculpture and health suites. Sales manager Sasha Liddiard believes valet parking adds little to the overall cost or service charge. 'We had already allowed for 24-hour porterage,' he says. Buyers of the penthouse apartments at Century Buildings also get a bespoke service from the interior design consultancy of Mary Fox Linton, allowing them high individual control over the final specifications and colour schemes. There are Boffi kitchens and Philippe Starck, and hand showers in the bathroom. Nicholson Estates is now deciding whether to add 'steam showers', as two or three prospective purchasers have asked about them. Even more modest apartments - prices start at \u00a3110,000 - are interior designed and contain brand names you would recognise, as well as bamboo flooring, the latest 'must have' for people who may now find more ordinary natural woods a little pass\u00e9 . Liddiard says the other advantage of including luxury extras at the point of property purchase is it reduces the 'hassle factor' for buyers. For those purchasing as an investment, a ready-equipped property can cut the time between purchase and obtaining a rental income. Nicholson estimates that as many as 30 per cent of Century Buildings' purchasers are buying as an investment. The National House Builders' Federation says most firms - not just those at the top end of the market - are happy to do this. A spokesman says: 'Buyers who agree to purchase early are usually in the best position to stipulate their requirements.' Even today's technology may become tomorrow's everyday optional extra. The federation cites Wilcon Homes which has just completed a 'concept house' with a central computer and a changer for 200 CDs in the loft, linked to each room. John Weir, Wilcon's design director, says: 'This is a concept house - not a prototype. All the technology will be cheap enough to fit [to ordinary homes] in two or three years' time, and we will fit it because everyone will want its convenience.' The increasing interest in interior design, fuelled by a plethora of television programmes, has increased the public's desire for homes which look as though they belong on the cover of a glossy magazine. 'I suppose the London Docklands market has set the scene and the rest of the country has followed,' said David Parry, new homes and residential developments partner for Cluttons in the South-east. Upmarket new homes that previously boasted three garages may do better these days if they boast four - one with a higher roof than the rest to take a four-wheel drive vehicle - and the doors should open electronically, of course. Power showers, roll top baths, kitchens with granite work surfaces, Shaker-style cabinets and American-style larder fridges are among the other extras that find favour. But Parry warns that avant garde fittings may quickly become unfashionable, and have an impact on the price when the purchaser comes to resell the property. 'Whirlpool baths and limed oak kitchens are already things of the past,' he adds.",

They are now being forced to pay out to the NHS after for treating drivers who cause accidents, individual claims are costing more and personal injury claims are getting dearer. </p> <p>A recent report by investment bank Merrill Lynch partly blames the increasing number of cars on the road and the fact that a higher proportion of them are new ones, costing more to repair. </p> <p>Another big factor is competition among insurers. Many new companies, aided by technology, have come into the market in recent years and, for a time, this kept premiums down, with plenty prepared to offer cover at a loss to get a foothold in the market. </p> <p>There have been several large mergers over the last 18 months. Norwich Union is now to merge with CGU, which itself was a tie-up between General Accident and Commercial Union. The mergers have reduced competition, giving insurers the chance to raise premiums. </p> <p>Merrill Lynch sees premiums rising this year, as motor insurance 'continues to be, in general, a difficult area in which to make profits'. </p> <p>With premiums rising so sharply on the minimum legal cover, the Consumers' Association says it will watch for anyone raising prices to exploitative levels, beyond the amounts needed to restore profitability, or to mask inefficiency. </p> <p>The AA says it is still possible to cut premiums by as much as 36 per cent by shopping around. Although even the cheapest premiums are going, up, there is still wide variation in costs. </p> <p>Newer insurers, using telephone and Internet technology, continue to run aggressive price campaigns. </p> <p>Peoples Choice claims to be saving motorists hundreds of pounds with a competitive charging structure. It quotes a \u00a3296 saving made by a 29- year-old woman insuring a new BMW. She was quoted \u00a31,450 elsewhere, but \u00a31,153 by Peoples Choice. </p> <p>The AA's Warner says: 'The easiest thing is to take your renewal slip and send it off. You should never do that. Insurers are still jostling for position.' </p> <p>Firms now change premiums, for new customers, much more frequently than in the past. The cheapest today may not be the cheapest tomorrow. </p> <p>Other ways to cut the cost of cover include: </p> <p>\u0095 Seeking discounts for security devices. </p> <p>\u0095 Agreeing to pay more of any claim bill yourself through a larger 'excess'. </p> <p>\u0095 Checking insurance ratings before changing cars. They are rated according to risk in around 20 groups. </p> <p>\u0095 Taking extra driving lessons and a Pass Plus test, if you are under 25. </p> <p>\u0095 Considering abandoning comprehensive cover on an older car. Third party is the legal minimum, but a half-way house - third party, fire and theft - may do. </p> <p>\u0095 Don't claim unless it's vital. A lost no-claims bonus can cost money for years. </p> <p>\u0095 Insuring fewer people to drive the car. </p> <p>\u0095 If you are over 50, try specialist insurers such as Age Concern Insurance Services. But still get quotes from mainstream firms. </p> <p>\u0095 Seeking discounts if you cover only a low mileage, or for garaging your car. </p> <p>Gloomy motorists forced to pay steep increases now should take heart, however, from the previous patterns of the insurance industry. </p> <p>Warner says: 'Although it's gloom and doom at the moment, history has shown that premiums will start coming down again.'</p>",

A recent report by investment bank Merrill Lynch partly blames the increasing number of cars on the road and the fact that a higher proportion of them are new ones, costing more to repair. Another big factor is competition among insurers. Many new companies, aided by technology, have come into the market in recent years and, for a time, this kept premiums down, with plenty prepared to offer cover at a loss to get a foothold in the market. There have been several large mergers over the last 18 months. Norwich Union is now to merge with CGU, which itself was a tie-up between General Accident and Commercial Union. The mergers have reduced competition, giving insurers the chance to raise premiums. Merrill Lynch sees premiums rising this year, as motor insurance 'continues to be, in general, a difficult area in which to make profits'. With premiums rising so sharply on the minimum legal cover, the Consumers' Association says it will watch for anyone raising prices to exploitative levels, beyond the amounts needed to restore profitability, or to mask inefficiency. The AA says it is still possible to cut premiums by as much as 36 per cent by shopping around. Although even the cheapest premiums are going, up, there is still wide variation in costs. Newer insurers, using telephone and Internet technology, continue to run aggressive price campaigns. Peoples Choice claims to be saving motorists hundreds of pounds with a competitive charging structure. It quotes a \u00a3296 saving made by a 29- year-old woman insuring a new BMW. She was quoted \u00a31,450 elsewhere, but \u00a31,153 by Peoples Choice. The AA's Warner says: 'The easiest thing is to take your renewal slip and send it off. You should never do that. Insurers are still jostling for position.' Firms now change premiums, for new customers, much more frequently than in the past. The cheapest today may not be the cheapest tomorrow. Other ways to cut the cost of cover include: \u0095 Seeking discounts for security devices. \u0095 Agreeing to pay more of any claim bill yourself through a larger 'excess'. \u0095 Checking insurance ratings before changing cars. They are rated according to risk in around 20 groups. \u0095 Taking extra driving lessons and a Pass Plus test, if you are under 25. \u0095 Considering abandoning comprehensive cover on an older car. Third party is the legal minimum, but a half-way house - third party, fire and theft - may do. \u0095 Don't claim unless it's vital. A lost no-claims bonus can cost money for years. \u0095 Insuring fewer people to drive the car. \u0095 If you are over 50, try specialist insurers such as Age Concern Insurance Services. But still get quotes from mainstream firms. \u0095 Seeking discounts if you cover only a low mileage, or for garaging your car. Gloomy motorists forced to pay steep increases now should take heart, however, from the previous patterns of the insurance industry. Warner says: 'Although it's gloom and doom at the moment, history has shown that premiums will start coming down again.'",

      "body": "<p> A few months ago, a small chapel in Norfolk closed because its congregation - two 89-year-old widows - was not enough to sustain it. What is remarkable is not that the congregation was small, but that it there were even two members. Which is not to say that Norfolk is heaving with practitioners of the black arts who prefer sects and drugs and rock 'n' roll to wholesome Christianity; rather that, with all the churches around, it would be easy to believe that there is one for each person and a gathering of two is a surge. </p> <p>As you drive along the narrow, overhung lanes into north Norfolk, up to Burnham Market, every corner reveals another church, round- or square-towered, built of hardy flint and stone. In this part of the world, wealth and worship were comfortable bedfellows, and the wool money of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was translated into a church for each tiny community. </p> <p>People who know this county call it a big place and, certainly, looking over the Wash or towards the North Sea or across the marshy stretches that are now almost exclusively bird sanctuaries luring ornithologists from around the world, there is a breadth to it that is startling. But a more abiding impression is the closeness of the countryside, the tight roads that reduce to single tracks, hairpinning through woods and hamlets; and in front of you will be another church in another parish, perhaps with a lonely, widowed congregation. </p> <p>There are six Burnhams close to or on the shoreline, each with its chapel, and it was at the inland Burnham Thorpe that Nelson was born in 1758, though he shuffled off (wholly intact) to sea when he was just 12 years old. If pottering about in little boats along the ragged coast was half as popular in Nelson's day as it is now, it is easy to see where he got his lust for sailing. </p> <p>Perhaps, though, north Norfolk in the late 1700s was a bit too quiet for the action midget because, apart from one five-year spell when he was sidelined by the navy, he rarely returned there, preferring to leave bits of himself scattered around the world. </p> <p>When he was around, Nelson would walk the countryside, calling in at the impressive Palladian mansion Holkham Hall, an eighteenth-century house in 3,000 walled acres and home to the Earls of Leicester. There is plenty of evidence of the Leicesters' wealth in the Rubens, Van Dyck and Gainsborough that hang in the house, and the family must certainly have added to the spiritual welfare of the community with a church or two. </p> <p>All along the shore road, from Wells-next-the-Sea and Holkham beach - where Gwyneth Paltrow was filmed wading ashore at the close of Shakespeare in Love - and heading west are deep dunes and inlets and marshes, ideal nesting grounds for terns and gulls, though whether Nelson was himself a bird-watcher one can only guess at. </p> <p>But he did go to Wells-next-the-Sea, which even in his day was not by the sea, though it had once been one of the great ports of eastern England. Now there is a quay about a mile from the town centre which, while it bustles with pleasure craft and has a distinct fish-and-chip air with its amusement arcades and comfort-food caf\u00e9s, is still a commercially viable port. </p> <p>Heading for King's Lynn and Sandringham, the waterside towns and villages - a couple of Burnhams (Overy Staithe and Deep Dale), Brancaster, Titchwell - are bustling with enthusiastic sailors in their bright yellow survival kits, pushing trailered boats down to the water. </p> <p>Hunstanton (and no matter how you say it, it makes you sound either asthmatic or adenoidal) is a different basin of fish. Here on a warm summer's day there are strolling holidaymakers and parked caravans by the high Cliff Parade, on which signs warning of crumbling cliffs would only need slight rewording to refer accurately to many of the people heading for the quay and its amusements. </p> <p>But the walk is refreshing and many of the houses, set back a hundred yards or so from the cliff edge, are beautiful, some Victorian. As you pass the bowling green and teashop there is a truly psychedelic memorial garden, of harsh blue and yellow and orange blooms. It is a very English place, a relief from the earnestness of the sailors with their tiny yachts. </p> <p>Yet the real delights of this very pretty county lie just as much behind the coast. The villages, some stretched thinly along quiet through roads, others huddled about as if for security, have their churches, obviously, and little caf\u00e9s and shops and pubs. Among the prettiest is, inevitably, a Burnham (Market), a mile or two from Nelson's birthplace. The locals, who seem to be equally divided between weekenders and full-time residents, call this area Little Chelsea - the giveaway is the towbarred Volvos and 4x4s. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Burnham Market is an elongated elegance of shops and caf\u00e9s, a restaurant or two, and a fine hotel, the Hoste Arms, with which Nelson was certainly familiar when it was called the Pitt Arms. Since then it has undergone several reincarnations, including a brothel for Victorian gentlemen, before being snapped up by Paul Whittome in 1989. </p> <p>Paul's not uneccentric persona is reflected in the Hoste Arms's character, but no harm is done for all that, as it meanders slightly through snug sitting-room and woody bar to conservatory and comfortable restaurant, its rooms four-postered or ginghamed or both. On a warm evening, drinking a pint in the groomed gardens, you think about how Nelson would have reflected on what has changed in his part of the world - and maybe on how much, particularly the church buildings, has stayed the same. </p> <p>\u0095 John Barton stayed at the Hoste Arms Hotel, the Green, Burnham Market, King's Lynn PE31 8HD (01328 738 777) .

But it was clearly not our financial institutions that attracted him. When he first arrived he found the newspapers full of pension and endowment misselling. He says it made him more mistrustful. </p> <p>So, instead of doing something sensible with his \u00a36,000 savings , he blew them. He admits: 'I lived the life of Riley, which was good while it lasted but meant I was soon back to square one financially.' </p> <p>Now he is getting worried. He says: 'After doing a bit of maths and working out that I have only 23 years until I reach age 60, I have suffered a panic attack and am now looking for advice. My previous attitude has led me into a situation where I feel I am not prepared for the present or the future.' He is planning to buy his own flat. Until now he has been living in rented accommodation. He has therefore been saving hard to build up a deposit and has been putting \u00a3500 a month or more into a savings account at his bank, although he has recently opened an Egg account to get a more competitive rate of interest. </p> <p>He is now looking around north London for a property and already has agreement in principle for a mortgage of \u00a3117,000 from Abbey National on a discounted variable rate, which with the \u00a320,000 he has saved would allow him to buy somewhere for around \u00a3137,000. But he wonders if this is the right mortgage, or whether he would be better with a fixed rate or flexible loan. </p> <p>His pension prospects have also improved since a move to a new employer where he has been able to join a final salary pension scheme to which he contributes 4 per cent of his salary. With no previous provision though, he realises he should save extra towards his retirement and is wondering whether an AVC scheme or Isa would be better. After he starts paying his mortgage, he expects to be able to save \u00a3200 to \u00a3300 per month. The AVCs available through his employer are offered by Standard Life and Equitable Life. </p> <p>Simon has been living quite frugally recently though he does enjoy his fortnightly trumpet lessons at \u00a330 a time, and in the summer he hopes to be able to fit in some sailing. His other major outgoing is visiting his mother in New Zealand each year, which costs him around \u00a32,000 a time. </p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Amanda Davidson</strong></p> <p>Simon has rightly equated that rent is dead money and decided to buy a property. The Abbey has offered to lend him a generous multiple of his income so he needs to be sure he can afford the payments. If he opts for a flexible or variable rate loan he should ensure he can repay the mortgage should it increase by a margin of, say 1 or 2 per cent. Fixed rates will offer him security of interest payments whereas flexible loans will enable him to pay off chunks and increase and decrease the payments. He needs to decide which of these is more important to him. </p> <p>Once Simon has a property, he should certainly take a critical illness policy to cover the mortgage. It is great that Simon has got a good company pension scheme but he has started saving relatively late. So it does need to be topped up. We believe an Isa would be his best bet. Admittedly he will not get tax relief on the contributions, but the whole fund will be tax-free and at his disposal whenever he wants, either at retirement or earlier. It is this flexibility, of use particularly when Simon is a basic-rate taxpayer, that we feel will be advantageous to him. As a first Isa, he should go for a fund which invests 50 per cent in the UK and 50 per cent internationally. This will give him a spectrum of investments. We would also recommend that he set aside only \u00a3100 a month as a start, not the \u00a3200 to \u00a3300 he feels he could afford. This is because he will need more money than he expects to buy a property and he needs to get this sorted first. </p> <p>\u0095 Amanda Davidson works for financial advisers Holden Meehan.</p> <p> <strong>Adviser 2: Gillian Cardy</strong></p> <p>When looking at total costs over five years, fixed-rate mortgages are not the best value. As the common view is that interest rates are expected to fall in the longer term, a discounted product means Simon will be able to benefit from these reductions. However, he should be careful of redemption penalties. </p> <p>A switch to a flexible mortgage after the end of the product term would enable him to choose to overpay on a regular basis, thus shortening the term of the loan and reducing the total interest bill. </p> <p>It is good that he has joined the pension scheme. The benefits will be worth much more than the 4 per cent of salary that he is contributing. However, although he could fund for a higher pension with AVCs I am not sure this would be his best option. What length of time does he see himself working with the company? Frequent changes can mean AVCs are less effective for building up a top-up pension fund. </p> <p>Making regular savings into more flexible vehicles such as Isas generates a tax-advantaged fund which does not have to be swapped for a taxable annuity at retirement, and leaves him with the option of using capital built up to repay his mortgage earlier. </p> <p>Other items for Simon to consider are life and critical illness cover.

      "bodyText": "Vital statistics SIMON WILSON AGE 37 LIVES IN North London OCCUPATION Electrical engineer EARNS \u00a330,000 MORTGAGE None at present DEBTS None INVESTMENTS \u00a320,000 in bank account PENSION Occupational scheme AIMS: To get advice on mortgage and find out whether it is better to top up his pension with an AVC or ISA. Simon came to the UK from New Zealand seven years ago and has now decided to stay permanently. But it was clearly not our financial institutions that attracted him. When he first arrived he found the newspapers full of pension and endowment misselling. He says it made him more mistrustful. So, instead of doing something sensible with his \u00a36,000 savings , he blew them. He admits: 'I lived the life of Riley, which was good while it lasted but meant I was soon back to square one financially.' Now he is getting worried. He says: 'After doing a bit of maths and working out that I have only 23 years until I reach age 60, I have suffered a panic attack and am now looking for advice. My previous attitude has led me into a situation where I feel I am not prepared for the present or the future.' He is planning to buy his own flat. Until now he has been living in rented accommodation. He has therefore been saving hard to build up a deposit and has been putting \u00a3500 a month or more into a savings account at his bank, although he has recently opened an Egg account to get a more competitive rate of interest. He is now looking around north London for a property and already has agreement in principle for a mortgage of \u00a3117,000 from Abbey National on a discounted variable rate, which with the \u00a320,000 he has saved would allow him to buy somewhere for around \u00a3137,000. But he wonders if this is the right mortgage, or whether he would be better with a fixed rate or flexible loan. His pension prospects have also improved since a move to a new employer where he has been able to join a final salary pension scheme to which he contributes 4 per cent of his salary. With no previous provision though, he realises he should save extra towards his retirement and is wondering whether an AVC scheme or Isa would be better. After he starts paying his mortgage, he expects to be able to save \u00a3200 to \u00a3300 per month. The AVCs available through his employer are offered by Standard Life and Equitable Life. Simon has been living quite frugally recently though he does enjoy his fortnightly trumpet lessons at \u00a330 a time, and in the summer he hopes to be able to fit in some sailing. His other major outgoing is visiting his mother in New Zealand each year, which costs him around \u00a32,000 a time. Adviser 1: Amanda Davidson Simon has rightly equated that rent is dead money and decided to buy a property. The Abbey has offered to lend him a generous multiple of his income so he needs to be sure he can afford the payments. If he opts for a flexible or variable rate loan he should ensure he can repay the mortgage should it increase by a margin of, say 1 or 2 per cent. Fixed rates will offer him security of interest payments whereas flexible loans will enable him to pay off chunks and increase and decrease the payments. He needs to decide which of these is more important to him. Once Simon has a property, he should certainly take a critical illness policy to cover the mortgage. It is great that Simon has got a good company pension scheme but he has started saving relatively late. So it does need to be topped up. We believe an Isa would be his best bet. Admittedly he will not get tax relief on the contributions, but the whole fund will be tax-free and at his disposal whenever he wants, either at retirement or earlier. It is this flexibility, of use particularly when Simon is a basic-rate taxpayer, that we feel will be advantageous to him. As a first Isa, he should go for a fund which invests 50 per cent in the UK and 50 per cent internationally. This will give him a spectrum of investments. We would also recommend that he set aside only \u00a3100 a month as a start, not the \u00a3200 to \u00a3300 he feels he could afford. This is because he will need more money than he expects to buy a property and he needs to get this sorted first. \u0095 Amanda Davidson works for financial advisers Holden Meehan. Adviser 2: Gillian Cardy When looking at total costs over five years, fixed-rate mortgages are not the best value. As the common view is that interest rates are expected to fall in the longer term, a discounted product means Simon will be able to benefit from these reductions. However, he should be careful of redemption penalties. A switch to a flexible mortgage after the end of the product term would enable him to choose to overpay on a regular basis, thus shortening the term of the loan and reducing the total interest bill. It is good that he has joined the pension scheme. The benefits will be worth much more than the 4 per cent of salary that he is contributing. However, although he could fund for a higher pension with AVCs I am not sure this would be his best option. What length of time does he see himself working with the company? Frequent changes can mean AVCs are less effective for building up a top-up pension fund. Making regular savings into more flexible vehicles such as Isas generates a tax-advantaged fund which does not have to be swapped for a taxable annuity at retirement, and leaves him with the option of using capital built up to repay his mortgage earlier. Other items for Simon to consider are life and critical illness cover. He may have income protection at work, but he should make sure he understands what cover is provided and whether he should top it up. He should also consider redundancy cover in respect of mortgage payments. \u0095 Gillian Cardy works for financial advisers Professional Partnerships. \u0095 Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

      "body": "<p>I realise I am frightened of writing this article about the death of my 22-year-old grandson, Keita Craig. I'm frightened for two reasons.</p> <p>First, because he was diagnosed last summer as a 'paranoid schizophrenic' and the image of schizophrenia is that of a knife-wielding maniac. In the end, Keita did indeed conform to this media stereotype. He attempted to snatch a handbag from a woman and then punched a man who tried to stop him.</p> <p>Keita was very gentle and we think it was a cry for help; a failed attempt, as it turned out, to get somebody in the huge phalanx of 'experts' that invaded his life to pay him some kind of attention. What the poor woman must have seen was a six-foot man of mixed race attempting to mug her. If she'd had time to look at him, she would have seen that he rocked uncontrollably from side to side. This was one of the many unwelcome side effects of the bi-monthly injections.</p> <p>Second, how does anyone begin to try and explain the crippling and unpredictable effects of mental illness on not only the sufferer, but also the family?</p> <p>My daughter, Cleo, was only 15 when Keita was born. His father, Mikey, was 17. After the initial shock of my child giving birth to a child, I comforted myself with the thought that Keita was born into two, big, loving warm families who welcomed him with all their hearts. I was going through a divorce at the time and facing a great deal of political persecution from the feminist movement. The first time I held Keita in my arms and looked down into his enormous, brown eyes, I felt my first-born grandson was fragile. Eighteen months later, his sister, Amber, was born and I was relieved to see that she was a tough little survivor.</p> <p>Living with Keita was like living with a miniature kamikaze pilot. He never walked when he could run and if he wasn't running - usually straight into trouble - he was dancing. Cleo and Mikey and their two children lived in my house with Amos, my natural son, and several other boys who chose to live with us. Keita and Amber grew up in a house that was filled with books and music. Within a few years, Mikey was organising the group that was to become Culture Club. George, John and Roy were frequent guests. Amos was rapping on the first Culture Club album Kissing To Be Clever, and Keita and Amber modelled Culture Club-style clothing with their mother and father.</p> <p>In many ways, those early years of my grandchildren's lives were idyllic, but for me there were serious political considerations. I resigned from my refuge in Chiswick after a power struggle with the feminist movement which didn't approve of my therapeutic approach to domestic violence. Then I began receiving death threats from extremists opposed to my belief that a woman could be responsible for her own behaviour, so my post had to be diverted to the bomb squad and I had to have a police escort on my 1982 tour around England for my book, Prone to Violence. During a tense visit from the bomb squad to my house, I saw the fear on Keita and Amber's faces and it was then that I made the final decision to go abroad. Culture Club had yet to make their fortune, but Cleo knew that Mikey needed to be free to spend much of his time touring the world and she opted to come to America with me.</p> <p>We settled in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and I think the years we lived there and then subsequently on a tiny island called The Brac, in the Cayman Islands, were the happiest in Keita's life. He was able to find the freedom he needed. When we first arrived in Santa Fe, Keita removed the planks from his bunk bed and named them Jesus, Mary and Joseph. They all had to be fed before the family could sit down at the table. I watched Michael Jackson's 'Killer' video 56 times with Keita, and Mikey sent him a bright-red Michael Jackson jacket with the gloves. Without an ounce of self-consciousness, Keita walked through the malls in Santa Fe, waving at his adoring public and signing autographs. He did, indeed, look like a miniature Michael Jackson.</p> <p>But the state school found his eccentricity unmanageable and the little private school announced that he had a 'wire loose'. We were a big multiracial family which inflamed some of the local redneck households. Our dog was shot one Christmas Day and two others stolen. Keita and Amber were discriminated against and many of the children were told not to play with them. I decided to move to the Cayman Islands where the families were 60 per cent mixed race. It proved to be a wise choice. Both children were very happy there.</p> <p>Cleo married Dervin on The Brac and Didi was born in 1990. Cleo came back to England in 1992 with the children and Keita very quickly formed his own group, the Cabians. Amos helped him to make demo tapes and he came close to getting a contract. Keita also successfully applied to go to the Brit - a school devoted to music and the arts in Croydon. He won a Levi competition and was offered a modelling contract, but there were shadows surrounding him. From being an intensely energetic, popular boy, he began to withdraw into himself. He started smoking marijuana and spent more and more time in his bedroom, listening to his music or sleeping. Cleo was worried and arranged with Mikey to attend family therapy.</p> <p>Now began the dreadful saga experienced by so many families who try to get help for their loved ones. By the time Keita was 16, we knew that he was seriously mentally ill. He was never diagnosed as a drug addict, but he was 'drug sensitive'. This means that even small amounts of marijuana made him hallucinate.</p> <p>The first time he was taken into Queen Mary's, Roehampton, we realised that he was badly in need of treatment. When I went to visit him, I was shaken by the amount of sedatives he'd been given. The slurring of his speech and the confusion in his eyes haunted me. As he slipped into his hallucinations, his world became a very terrifying place. He often told me that he was frightened of walking the streets.</p> <p>Of course, his doctors would say it was because he was paranoid, but I knew that Keita was afraid of being a mixed-race, six-foot-tall man. 'People look at me funny, Grandma,' he said. He was frightened of the police stopping him for questioning. He hated the idea of violence but, inevitably, because of his size and colour, violence intruded upon him. Buying marijuana brought him into contact with drug dealers and other addicts. He had his worst hallucinations on crack and ecstasy. His friends were other drug addicts, mostly young men. The National Schizophrenia Fellowship helped and advised us as we struggled from one appointment to another.</p> <p>Cleo and I met up once a week to clean Keita's flat. He loved his 'pad' and though he kept it tidy, by now he had degenerated to the extent that he smelt. After his stay in hospital, he agreed that he would make me a list of food and I would bring it for him. Eventually, we made our first visit to Tesco. He was frightened by the supermarket. In time, he looked forward to our expeditions and I was childishly happy the day he decided to add tuna fish to his diet.</p> <p>Amos was close to Keita. Even when Keita was at his worst, which meant that his eyes rolled up to the ceiling and he carried on whispered conversations with his tormentors, Amos took us all out for family celebrations. Sometimes, we were rewarded with Keita's brilliant smile and his wicked, gurgling laughter.</p> <p>I had just come out of hospital when Amos telephoned to say Keita was in Richmond police station. He told me not to worry; Cleo would be at Richmond magistrates' court the next morning. She came to supper the next day, Tuesday, 1 February. I couldn't understand why Keita had been sent to the hospital wing of Wandsworth jail the day before and not to a mental hospital. Cleo told me he had been desperate and suicidal in the prison cells at the magistrates' court. 'Don't worry, Mum,' she said. 'He's on a suicide watch.' I hugged her when she left at around 8.30. 'At least he's in safe hands,' I said. 'However awful the situation is, maybe we can get something done for him.'</p> <p>There was to be a hearing in Wandsworth the next day which we hoped would get Keita diverted to a mental hospital. I telephoned Cleo at eight the next morning. Keita's godmother answered. 'Tell Cleo I'm praying for Keita,' I said and then I heard Cleo crying. 'Keita's dead,' his godmother said. 'How?' I asked. 'He hung himself with his trainer laces,' she said.</p> <p>The last time I saw Keita, we'd been shopping and he chosen a huge sirloin steak. He hugged me and said: 'I love you, Grandma.' He smiled and waved, clutching his carrier bag full of goodies. The next time I saw him, he was in his coffin. I watched my son carry my grandson to his grave. Since Keita died in Wandsworth, two more men have committed suicide. When will it end?</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The day before I met Ian Hislop, I causally asked a colleague if he knew of any vile rumours featuring the Private Eye editor. 'No,' he replied, apparently shocked at the suggestion. 'And if I did, I wouldn't tell you, and if I did tell you, you wouldn't print them.' </p> <p>'Why wouldn't I?' I challenged, now taking the opportunity to appear shocked myself. 'Because,' he explained, not unseriously, 'he's one of the most powerful men in the country.' Clearly, he is no such thing, any more, to adapt Hislop's most celebrated phrase, than I am a banana. But it is true that he possesses the ability to make journalists nervous. </p> <p>I recall that one editor I worked for was terrified lest any of his more wayward pronouncements made their way into the satirical magazine's Street of Shame section, which, of course, they duly did. But so what? A fleeting mention in a poorly printed publication that is renowned for paying out large sums in libel. What kind of damage can that possibly inflict on a reputation? In the real world, probably very little. </p> <p>But the Eye 's victims tend not to spend much time in the real world. People in exalted positions do not like to be laughed at. They think it undermines their authority. They think, correctly, that staff, friends and even strangers will giggle when they leave the room. And that is precisely the insecurity upon which Private Eye has been trading for nearly 40 years. </p> <p>If that's power, it's the power of pinpointing the weakness of the powerful: politicians, business people, the media and celebrities. Next week sees the 1,000th issue of the Eye, a milestone that will be marked by a commemorative book of the magazine's famously formulaic covers: a stock photograph of someone in the news with a comic speech bubble attached. </p> <p>For more than 300 of those issues, or nearly 14 years, Hislop has been in charge of deciding what to put on the front. He was made editor at 26, when the then incumbent, Richard Ingrams, suddenly announced his retirement and, to the dismay of a number of middle-aged hacks, placed the youngster in his stead. </p> <p>'All these blimpish old-timers hate the young,' Hislop responded at the time. 'I may not be classically good-looking, I may cut a slightly ludicrous figure when I am referred to as \"the Voice of Youth\" but time is unquestionably on my side. You wait and see.' </p> <p>This year he will turn 40. In a sense, he has always looked 40, although a schoolboyish mien has helped slow an otherwise brisk march into middle age. His brief stature and pinched expression have inspired an imaginative collection of literary portraits down the years, and his face has been described in terms of most things - currant buns, the devil's sperm [sic] - except a face. </p> <p>In person, he looks quite unexceptional. Contrary to opinion, including, perhaps, his own, he does not have a funny face. By which I mean, it's not a face that would predispose you to laughter. I often feel that on television in Have I Got News For You he unwisely relies on his trademark squint - a sudden implosion of his features - that, far from seeming humorous, serves to emphasise a kind of caricature of pomposity. </p> <p>But there's little trace of comic vanity on display in his room in Private Eye's Soho offices.

Technically, the magazine is owned by its shareholders, but they're not consulted.' There's a mythology surrounding Private Eye, mostly self-generated, to which Hislop does not appear immune.

Yet when the marriage of his friend, Harry Thompson, the producer of Have I Got News For You, broke up - quite publicly it should be said - Hislop ran a series of pieces making fun of the fall-out.

      "bodyText": "The day before I met Ian Hislop, I causally asked a colleague if he knew of any vile rumours featuring the Private Eye editor. 'No,' he replied, apparently shocked at the suggestion. 'And if I did, I wouldn't tell you, and if I did tell you, you wouldn't print them.' 'Why wouldn't I?' I challenged, now taking the opportunity to appear shocked myself. 'Because,' he explained, not unseriously, 'he's one of the most powerful men in the country.' Clearly, he is no such thing, any more, to adapt Hislop's most celebrated phrase, than I am a banana. But it is true that he possesses the ability to make journalists nervous. I recall that one editor I worked for was terrified lest any of his more wayward pronouncements made their way into the satirical magazine's Street of Shame section, which, of course, they duly did. But so what? A fleeting mention in a poorly printed publication that is renowned for paying out large sums in libel. What kind of damage can that possibly inflict on a reputation? In the real world, probably very little. But the Eye 's victims tend not to spend much time in the real world. People in exalted positions do not like to be laughed at. They think it undermines their authority. They think, correctly, that staff, friends and even strangers will giggle when they leave the room. And that is precisely the insecurity upon which Private Eye has been trading for nearly 40 years. If that's power, it's the power of pinpointing the weakness of the powerful: politicians, business people, the media and celebrities. Next week sees the 1,000th issue of the Eye, a milestone that will be marked by a commemorative book of the magazine's famously formulaic covers: a stock photograph of someone in the news with a comic speech bubble attached. For more than 300 of those issues, or nearly 14 years, Hislop has been in charge of deciding what to put on the front. He was made editor at 26, when the then incumbent, Richard Ingrams, suddenly announced his retirement and, to the dismay of a number of middle-aged hacks, placed the youngster in his stead. 'All these blimpish old-timers hate the young,' Hislop responded at the time. 'I may not be classically good-looking, I may cut a slightly ludicrous figure when I am referred to as \"the Voice of Youth\" but time is unquestionably on my side. You wait and see.' This year he will turn 40. In a sense, he has always looked 40, although a schoolboyish mien has helped slow an otherwise brisk march into middle age. His brief stature and pinched expression have inspired an imaginative collection of literary portraits down the years, and his face has been described in terms of most things - currant buns, the devil's sperm [sic] - except a face. In person, he looks quite unexceptional. Contrary to opinion, including, perhaps, his own, he does not have a funny face. By which I mean, it's not a face that would predispose you to laughter. I often feel that on television in Have I Got News For You he unwisely relies on his trademark squint - a sudden implosion of his features - that, far from seeming humorous, serves to emphasise a kind of caricature of pomposity. But there's little trace of comic vanity on display in his room in Private Eye's Soho offices. Hislop is faultlessly polite and solicitously charming. All the same, it is obvious that he is enormously proud of the magazine. 'It genuinely makes me laugh,' he says, flicking through the current issue. With its in-jokes and catchphrases, its conservative scepticism and selected targets, Private Eye is a magazine that has continually made its readership laugh, but in a manner that has remained essentially unchanged in four decades.

Compared to the angry rows over the National Gallery's extension, the Channel Tunnel or the continuing controversy over the late and over-budget Scottish Parliament project, the Tate Modern team can dust their palms with pleasure.</p> <p>It is all rich vindication for the once-mocked activity of making contemporary art, which has moved in only a couple of generations from marginal status in a philistine, insular culture, via such famous scandals as Carl Andr\u00e9's bricks and the Turner Prize dust-ups, to become the most glamorous, honky-tonky wriggle and pout in today's self-consciously globalist Britain.</p> <p>Once it was rock music, then film-making, then the new novel. Now it is video art, constructions and paint. This month, as virtual fortunes virtually melt, even dot-commery is slightly behind the curve. How did it happen? Sir Nicholas Serota, the Tate's director, says it was mostly about the huge achievements of a succession of British artists - Lucien Freud, David Hockney and Howard Hodgkin, then successive generations until today's lot. Without them, the astonishing gallery would not have happened.</p> <p>Ironies, however, jangle through the giant building on the south bank of the Thames. Here, after all, is a great emblem of old British industrialism still with its massive girders and Glasgow- built cranes, stripped down and dressed in cool new clothing by young Swiss architects, to exhibit videos, mud paintings, blocks of basalt, delicate constructions of plastic and glass. This, we know, is part of the modern story of Britain, as the old economy gives way to a new global one; manufacturing to service; heavy to light.</p> <p>The man who first designed this art-cathedral as a power station in 1947 was Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, a titan of mid-century British design (Battersea Power Station; the Oxford and Cambridge University libraries; the red telephone box). He had also built a real cathedral, the Anglican one in Liverpool. But by the time he was doing this, Scott was already unfashionable, walking backwards before the onward march of the very international modernism that Tate Modern has been created to celebrate.</p> <p>Today, once more, there are great, rust-stained steel tubes being lowered into Bankside - not for pistons or turbines but for art-towers designed by the redoubtable 88-year-old French-American artist Louise Bourgeois. The long, airy light-box which covers the top of the building was put there by cool Swiss architects, whose aesthetic and tone is a million miles removed from Scott's brick beefiness.</p> <p>And the complexities continue outside. With its new spiderweb footbridge, the Bankside development now connects the City, the wealthiest square mile in Europe, to the poverty and backwaters of Southwark. When this Millennium Bridge, by the architect Norman Foster and the sculptor Anthony Caro, is opened next month, the symbolism will be acknowledged by the Bishop of London and the Bishop of Southwark who, after a service of thanksgiving, have decided to leave their respective cathedrals and walk out in procession and greet one another over the middle of the Thames.</p> <p>Does it mean anything more than a quirky moment in London's story? Southwark, the oldest suburb, has been the City's poor sister ever since it grew out of the exit from London Bridge. From its days of pilgrim-rooking taverns, bear-baiting and Elizabethan theatres, it became a slew of traffic-choked streets, the 'rookeries' of slum-dwellers, foul-smelling industries and - in modern times - bleak council estates, towers and office blocks.</p> <p>The riverbank area today has a cluster of high-profile cultural sites, from the rebuilt Shakespearean Globe to the Hayward Gallery and South Bank Centre. It is on the way 'up' with the scent of roast coffee in the air. But it's almost as if there is something in the watery soil of the area which fights back; everything remains, today as ever, on the cusp between regeneration and putrefaction. Foul streets, graffiti, beggars, rotten housing, the thick stink of petrol, unloved public spaces and lagoons of desperate poverty. Can Tate Modern, the latest of the cultural imports hanging on to the riverbank, make a difference?</p> <p>The blurb for the gallery claims that it will 'act as a catalyst for the regeneration of the area by encouraging public and private investment and highlighting Southwark as a desirable place to live'. Well, maybe. Management consultants say Tate Modern, with two million visitors a year, will help create 2,400 new jobs in London and generate 'between \u00a316m and \u00a335m of direct and indirect economic benefits' to Southwark. (This is what happens when you hire management consultants to wet their fingers and stick them in the air for public relations purposes.)</p> <p>But there is more to this than PR. Dawn Austwick, project manager for Tate Modern, points out that, unlike some other grand modern art galleries, this one does not have the feel of something plonked down from another world. The new Guggenheim in Bilbao, a more 'wow' building than this, was nevertheless an American implant in the Basque city. Here, they have done a lot of work with the local community and, in creating the Bankside Arts Training Trust, which brings together many of the local galleries and museums, have made a start at helping younger Lambeth and Southwark people get jobs. 'If you take on responsibility for this building, you have to take on responsibilities for the surrounding area. We did think quite hard about what this meant for us,' says Austwick.</p> <p>And yes, the Tate Modern is a place where the local meets the international - much more so than the City, whose international business and wealth has so pushed up prices that there is virtually no local community left in it. Staff from around the world, and artworks from around the world, will help open up a part of London that has been closed off from the buzz and energy of the surrounding capital.</p> <p>More than the management consultants' numbers, the real benefit to Southwark ought to be the optimism generated by unblocking lines of energy, north and south across the Thames, east and west along the river. The mental geography of London is being changed by Tate Modern and the Millennium Bridge. But this is not, after all, primarily a social or political project. It is about art, design, identity, pleasure. And, whatever the national pride in having a British answer to MoMA at last, this is a profoundly internationalist place, which answers the imperatives of modernist art - big, cool, even a little daunting.</p> <p>The Bankside is imposing enough on the outside. When Serota first thought seriously about buying it, he went out late one evening and paced its frontage, finding it to be some 500 feet. Now, when you get in, it seems even more vast than that. Most visitors will enter down a long wide ramp, into a cut-off hole like a multi-story car park entrance; and then suddenly find themselves standing on the floor of a massive man-made vault of brick painted in soft grey, with black steel supports and delicate, grainy light falling from very far above, like a grand canyon clothed by Versace.</p> <p>On the river side there are seven spacious floors, only three of which are galleries, and in them the feeling of wide-open space, lit mostly by natural light, is impressive. With natural wood floors, which will colour and darken with footsteps, they are art-prairies. Above and below are caf\u00e9s, education centres, art rooms, all looking out across the Thames towards the City, all washed with light, all big. There's an auditorium in shocking red, a womb for 200 eggheads. There's London's biggest art bookshop. Later stages of development will drive a lift up the giant, unused tower and exploit gargantuan underground spaces, the power-station's old oil-tanks.</p> <p>And what will be in it, exactly? When I visited, the hanging was still going on, the galleries smelling of fresh paint and mild panic, with mysterious, plastic-shrouded objects waiting to be unpacked. But enough was out and on show to make it obvious that all the modern shamans, saints and holy fools of the modern art story will be present - Beuys, Gabo, Warhol, Freud, Matisse, Hockney, Hirst, Bourgeois, Rothko, Monet, Picasso, Whiteread, Spencer and scores more, their names a pious incantation for the faithful.</p> <p>What effect will it have on the artists of Britain today? Cornelia Parker, whose famous blown-up garden shed (Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View), rarely seen in Britain since it was created in 1991 on a budget of \u00a3250, argues that it will liberate. 'It will really encourage a new generation of artists because they will see people recently out of art college there. When I was a 15-year-old wanting to be an artist, the ultimate achievement you could look forward to would be, maybe, the Tate when you were about 50 or 60.'</p> <p>Tate Modern, she says, seems more reachable at a time when so much interesting art is being made here. Dinos Chapman, one of the brothers whose Goya-based Disasters of War is shown at Tate Britain, upriver at Millbank, disagrees. 'It is almost diametrically opposed to the way art has been made in London by my generation of artists. We tend to be people who have made and exhibited work in artist-run spaces and small, out-of-the-way disused warehouses, so to place that work into this huge, reconstituted dead industrial space - it's as alien as putting it on the moon. That may be the function of museums anyway, to ossify... I see a lot of not so young YBAs (Young British Artists) moving around London thinking they have died.'</p> <p>No big gallery, of course, would be complete without dissident artists denouncing it as dead and past-tense even before it has opened. But the confidence of Tate Modern's guardians is unlikely to be dented. This is a massively self-certain project. Pursuing the religious analogy, Serota is the art-bishop of Britain, whose brilliant mind, self-assuredness and steely, ascetic presence hangs over the galleries. The people who work there, like some religious order, tend to dress in black and grey. They use little make-up and possess Insight. They seem serious and tense - though that may be merely the effect of the looming deadline. The two curators whose ideas and hanging judgments rule the opening of the new galleries, Frances Morris and Iwona Blazwick, are spoken of with some awe by other staff. But this was Serota's vision first.</p> <p>What are they all offering us? Ecstasy? Enlightenment? Peace? Reassurance? Membership of an educated elect? Speaking in Tate Britain (which will be connected to Tate Modern later this year by special ferry service), Serota replies: 'When you watch people walking round this building, what you see is a sense of exhilaration, delight, people finding things in themselves - moments of self-recognition - or recognising something in the world that has been presented to them in a new light.' Which is what religion would also hope to offer.</p> <p>There is certainly less academicism in Bankside than in some other modern art galleries. Morris and Blazwick have junked the idea of a period-by-period walk through twentieth-century art history. The triumphalist New York view of succeeding waves of artists replacing one another in the march towards the revelation of some ultimate truth (Jackson Pollock) has gone.</p> <p>Instead, there are four very broad themes: 'Landscape, Matter, Environment'; 'Still Life, Object, Real Life'; 'Nude, Action, Body'; 'History, Memory, Society'. This may sound poncey. Its effect is not. It has allowed the curators to juxtapose works in a startling and often witty way. When I visited, there was a room of Mondrians giving way to the squares of Gilbert &amp; George; Richard Long with his English outdoors romanticism sharing a conversation with a late Monet; Richard Deacon, Matisse, Hepworth and Brancusi bouncing off one another elsewhere. On another floor, where the shifting exhibitions will go, there are rooms of the Tate's installations - video art, mirrors, electronics, Parker's former garden shed.</p> <p>This staggering jumble is something every self-respecting modern global city needs. Walking these floors to look at painted and constructed things, some warmly familiar, some cold and challenging, is what modern educated citizens, particularly younger ones, believe is good for them.</p> <p>We will stop at Naum Gabo's tiny, delicate constructions, like exotic plexiglass insects, or Beuys's massive basalt blocks, as people used to stop before painted statues of saints, or pause and light a candle. And yes, there are stories in this place of human-to-human worship, but the morals are obscure and perhaps useless. There are shivers of delight and thrums of sensual pleasure; and other rooms where you struggle to understand, and strain to feel. There are hidden histories and the pickled reactions of passionate people to awesome events in the world around them, which have been coded by time and can be accurately read by initiates only.</p> <p>But something has been created here. Out of stored art, lottery money, hard work, vision and risk, there is a place to which I, for one, will constantly return for the rest of my life. Tate Modern is going to generate energy; in that sense, at least, Scott's old Bankside is a power station still.</p> <p>\u0095 Tate Modern opens to the public on 12 May</p>",

Revealing, at last, a huge collection of modern art mostly hidden in storage before, the converted power station will take its place as one of the three or four most important collections of twentieth-century art in the world. Better late than never, London will be up there with Paris and New York. Pompidou; MoMA; and now Tate Modern too.

      "body": "<p>Designing a major new museum has become the price of admission into the architectural big league. Richard Rogers built the Pompidou and became instantly famous. Frank Gehry had done a lot before the Guggenheim, but it was Bilbao that established his reputation outside the architectural ghetto. And now the same thing is happening to Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, architects of the Tate Modern.</p> <p>Before the Tate, their best-known work was a copper-clad signal box, perched on the approach to the main railway station in their home town of Basel like a giant Zippo. It was precisely their lack of profile, coupled with the fact that they seemed to have something fresh to say about architecture, that made Herzog &amp; de Meuron so attractive to the Tate. 'We knew that we would get the most out of them,' says its director, Nicholas Serota.</p> <p>But even before the Tate opened, the world has been beating a path to Basel to hire Herzog &amp; de Meuron. They are currently designing a flagship store for Prada in Tokyo and a hotel for Ian Schrager in New York. They are also working on a museum in San Francisco, a resort on Tenerife, an extension to the Walker Gallery in Minneapolis and a second project in London, the Laban Dance Centre. What makes Herzog &amp; de Meuron's work so powerful is that it is impossible to typecast. They don't have an aesthetic signature. Each project is different.</p> <p>Look at the Rudin house, a private commission just across the border from Basel in France. It seems like a child's idea of a house, hoisted up on stilts but rendered in bare concrete, in a sweet-and-sour combination that makes you think that these are old-line modernists. Then along comes the university library at Eberswalde, in former East Germany, which suggests just the opposite. The building itself, a simple rectangle, all but disappears under a collage produced by the artist Thomas Ruff.

      "bodyText": "Designing a major new museum has become the price of admission into the architectural big league. Richard Rogers built the Pompidou and became instantly famous. Frank Gehry had done a lot before the Guggenheim, but it was Bilbao that established his reputation outside the architectural ghetto. And now the same thing is happening to Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, architects of the Tate Modern. Before the Tate, their best-known work was a copper-clad signal box, perched on the approach to the main railway station in their home town of Basel like a giant Zippo. It was precisely their lack of profile, coupled with the fact that they seemed to have something fresh to say about architecture, that made Herzog &amp; de Meuron so attractive to the Tate. 'We knew that we would get the most out of them,' says its director, Nicholas Serota. But even before the Tate opened, the world has been beating a path to Basel to hire Herzog &amp; de Meuron. They are currently designing a flagship store for Prada in Tokyo and a hotel for Ian Schrager in New York. They are also working on a museum in San Francisco, a resort on Tenerife, an extension to the Walker Gallery in Minneapolis and a second project in London, the Laban Dance Centre. What makes Herzog &amp; de Meuron's work so powerful is that it is impossible to typecast. They don't have an aesthetic signature. Each project is different. Look at the Rudin house, a private commission just across the border from Basel in France. It seems like a child's idea of a house, hoisted up on stilts but rendered in bare concrete, in a sweet-and-sour combination that makes you think that these are old-line modernists. Then along comes the university library at Eberswalde, in former East Germany, which suggests just the opposite. The building itself, a simple rectangle, all but disappears under a collage produced by the artist Thomas Ruff. The boundary between solid wall and transparent windows disappears, with the images silk-screened on to the windows and etched into the concrete. The Herzog &amp; de Meuron repertoire also includes beautifully crafted timber structures - particularly the small but exquisite apartment building they did in Basel at the end of the Eighties. They are all different, but they share a unique sensibility. They are buildings asking you to look at the fundamentals of architecture, rather than stylistic mannerisms.

Such gobbledygook is commonplace in an exhibition which too often is an exercise in how not to communicate. Also at Stills, Dubliner Kathy Prendergast's Lost Map, a computer-generated image on paper, depicts the United States as a country made up of places all with the word 'lost' in their names.

As far as I could make out, there were no Lost and Founds, Lost Souls or Get Losts. </p> <p>At Inverleith House, Simon Starling makes an ecological statement by building a model plane out of balsa wood from a tree cut down in Ecuador.

'Ultimately, the artist's source is the history in which we are all located.'

It is an odd sensation to feel your way around a room packed almost from floor to ceiling with coloured balloons, at once claustrophobic and liberating. You do not know whether anyone is in the room with you and, unless you hug the walls, it's easy to become disorientated, like being lost in a maze. </p> <p>The balloons move like Pamela Anderson's bosom and, oddly, squeak and tweet like little birds. After a while, I felt I was in an aviary and would happily have stayed a lot longer. It was enjoyable but Creed's installation could just as easily have been part of Edinburgh's excellent science festival. </p> <p>Matthew Higgs, in an interesting essay in the show's catalogue, seems to share my jaundiced view. The hallmark of contemporary British art is not a desire for posterity, he suggests, but temporality. The adage that art is long and life is short has been turned on its head; these days, art is short (and worthless) and life, by comparison, is long and ever more precious. </p> <p>Certainly, Higgs's argument is borne out by what he and his fellow curators have gathered together.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> The Two Pigeons </strong> Birmingham Royal Ballet, Birmingham Repertory Theatre </p> <p><strong> Nederlands Dans Theater 2 </strong> Sadler's Wells, London EC1 </p> <p>Like its sister company in Covent Garden, the <strong> Birmingham Royal Ballet</strong> is honouring its founder choreographer, Frederick Ashton, by reviving little-seen works as well as firm favourites. BRB's base at the Hippodrome is being redeveloped, so its two Ashton programmes (the second one starts this Friday) are at the Repertory Theatre, with a makeshift orchestra pit. </p> <p>Harpist and cellists sit on either side of the apron stage, while some of the players seem within range of the dancers' feet. All the odder, then, that the dancing on the first night did not seem driven by the music. The programme opened with Ashton confections of rose petals, ribbons, sighs and sentiment, gala treats that need to be brought off with assurance and innate musicality. </p> <p>His Voices of Spring pas de deux, for example, was originally a dashing divertissement in the Royal Opera's 1997 production of Die Fledermaus. A Strauss extravaganza with fluttering draperies and Soviet-style lifts, the pas de deux looked on Wednesday like an underpowered pairs-skating routine. </p> <p> The Walk to the Paradise Garden (1972) resembled one of those ice-dance numbers where he hauls her upside down for no very good reason and they both die, splat, when their time is up. </p> <p>Molly Smolen made a brave fist of Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan, coached by Lynn Seymour. Ashton recaptured the effect Duncan's dancing had made on him as a young man, rather than attempting to recreate what she actually did. Seymour always looked as though she improvised her responses to the pianist's on-stage playing: Smolen can't manage that, although she conveyed something of Duncan's headstrong allure as a young woman before she became raddled. </p> <p> Isadora should end the series of 'pi\u00e8ces d'occasion', so that the imagined scent of her scattered rose petals could linger through the interval. The Two Pigeons, which follows, is a very different evocation of youth and vulnerability. The danger is that the wilful heroine, if she is not a natural charmer, becomes as tiresome as Duncan at her worst.

      "bodyText": "The Two Pigeons Birmingham Royal Ballet, Birmingham Repertory Theatre Nederlands Dans Theater 2 Sadler's Wells, London EC1 Like its sister company in Covent Garden, the Birmingham Royal Ballet is honouring its founder choreographer, Frederick Ashton, by reviving little-seen works as well as firm favourites. BRB's base at the Hippodrome is being redeveloped, so its two Ashton programmes (the second one starts this Friday) are at the Repertory Theatre, with a makeshift orchestra pit. Harpist and cellists sit on either side of the apron stage, while some of the players seem within range of the dancers' feet. All the odder, then, that the dancing on the first night did not seem driven by the music. The programme opened with Ashton confections of rose petals, ribbons, sighs and sentiment, gala treats that need to be brought off with assurance and innate musicality. His Voices of Spring pas de deux, for example, was originally a dashing divertissement in the Royal Opera's 1997 production of Die Fledermaus. A Strauss extravaganza with fluttering draperies and Soviet-style lifts, the pas de deux looked on Wednesday like an underpowered pairs-skating routine. The Walk to the Paradise Garden (1972) resembled one of those ice-dance numbers where he hauls her upside down for no very good reason and they both die, splat, when their time is up. Molly Smolen made a brave fist of Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan, coached by Lynn Seymour. Ashton recaptured the effect Duncan's dancing had made on him as a young man, rather than attempting to recreate what she actually did. Seymour always looked as though she improvised her responses to the pianist's on-stage playing: Smolen can't manage that, although she conveyed something of Duncan's headstrong allure as a young woman before she became raddled. Isadora should end the series of 'pi\u00e8ces d'occasion', so that the imagined scent of her scattered rose petals could linger through the interval. The Two Pigeons, which follows, is a very different evocation of youth and vulnerability. The danger is that the wilful heroine, if she is not a natural charmer, becomes as tiresome as Duncan at her worst. Dorcas Walters is no spring chicken, so the child-woman choreography seemed winsome, the bird imagery contrived. Appalled at a future cooped up with her, the young man (Robert Parker) flees to the gypsy encampment in Act II. Bad choice, although Parker redeemed himself by dancing a bravura solo during the low-life revelry. As his gypsy rival, Joseph Cipolla lacked the will and the staying-power to see him off convincingly. Parker was mugged rather than being chastened by his own inadequacy. On his return to ask forgiveness from the girl he left behind, Parker did the right gestures without supplying the feelings behind them, rather like the trained doves that fly across the set. Walters succeeded in claiming the ballet back, as the heroine should, during the lovers' reunion. Their final pas de deux is pure wish-fulfilment, the girl trembling at her mate's touch as her tears turn to rapture. Ashton's delicate drawing was somewhat smudged by this couple, who aren't right for each other, but idealised love won through, just. Whether BRB can tackle tougher Ashton - Scenes de Ballet and a reconstructed Dante Sonata - will be seen later this week. Nederlands Dans Theater 2, the junior company based at the Hague, paid its first visit to the new Sadler's Wells last week, after three previous tours of this country under the Wells banner. This latest visit is a curtain-raiser for all three NDT companies' appearance in the Edinburgh Festival at the end of August.

      "body": "<p>The smell of incense wafts over the first few rows of the Madison Square Garden arena as David Crosby walks on stage holding a fistful of joss sticks. 'Peace, everyone,' he smiles. In the crowd, middle-aged men in T-shirts and jeans brandish gigantic joints; one man hollows out a cigar and stuffs it with marijuana. It seems like every old hippie in New York is here for the first concert in the city by Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young since 1974. </p> <p>The story of CSN&amp;Y, the first supergroup of the Woodstock era, serves as a parable for their generation. Formed in 1969, each of the four members arrived with weighty credentials. By the mid-Sixties, Crosby had pioneered West Coast folk psychedelia with The Byrds; Nash was a founder member of The Hollies; and both Stills and Young had enjoyed successful solo careers after the demise of their joint project, Buffalo Springfield.</p> <p>Released at the height of the Vietnam war, albums such as D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu and Four Way Street were landmark recordings, a powerful mix of three-part harmonies and smart political lyrics. Hugely popular and acclaimed, CSN&amp;Y could have been America's Beatles, but drug abuse and inflated egos saw them disband in acrimony after only four years together. 'David has to decide what he'd rather do: make music or smoke drugs,' Young said famously at the time. 'Now I know why The Byrds sacked him.' </p> <p>Since then, theirs has been a tale of cocaine addiction (Crosby), imprisonment (Crosby again), contrasting fortunes (ever-growing kudos for Young, decline for the others), abandoned reunions (in '75 and '88), freak accidents (Nash broke both legs in a boating accident last year), rekindled celebrity on the basis of being a sperm donor (Crosby again, who fathered lesbian rocker Melissa Etheridge's new baby), and, now, happy reconciliation. And if all that sounds improbable, only the last bit is exaggerated. For however, harmonious they appear on stage, David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and Neil Young still have unfinished business. </p> <p>In a hotel on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, David Crosby shuffles slowly into his suite. Strawberry-scented candles burn sweetly. Crosby hunkers down on a sofa, his truck-driver's gut squeezed into an undersized purple T-shirt. He wears a black waistcoat and loose blue slacks, complemented by odd socks. 'The show tonight will be radical,' he says, sleepy eyes blinking with excitement. 'Really far out - we're gonna blow the roof off the Garden.' </p> <p>With his shimmering stare, the sober Crosby has the appearance of someone eternally reliving a magic mushroom experience. Yet only seven hours before show time, he is suffering moments of anxiety. </p> <p>'Haaargh-Haaargh. Haaarg-Haaargh. Sorry, I gotta clear my throat,' he apologises, sounding uncannily like The Fast Show 's Bob Fleming. 'Haaargh-Haaargh-Haaaaargh!' </p> <p>'These two shows at Madison? They're both for Neil,' he whispers. 'In his opinion, we've never come close to realising our true potential. So we're not fighting anymore - we're too old to start boxing each other now.' </p> <p>Young's availability alone has made the CSN&amp;Y reunion possible: early last year an unsigned Crosby, Stills and Nash started recording an album. Though Young's contribution to Looking Forward is limited to four songs - all off-cuts from his new solo album Silver and Gold - the fully reformed CSN&amp;Y were quickly snapped up by Warners. </p> <p>'CSN&amp;Y keeps going only as long as Neil is happy,' says Crosby. 'It's not like he's unreasonable or anything; he just wants to know that we're committed. So, like in the past, when the remaining three of us start fighting, he'll just walk out and continue his own career. Satisfying Neil is something we've never been very good at in the past - and this is probably our last shot. </p> <p>'There is a financial motive involved in the reunion,' he admits. 'But that's not the only reason - I look at Neil and Stephen on stage, playing their guitars: and they're creating this unique kind of magic. What other group is there today that has this kind of pedigree?' </p> <p>But the reunited CSN&amp;Y still resurrect old scores daily. Individual members in New York stay at separate hotels, and there are only brief moments of affection during the concert. Young, especially, seems to have marked out his own domain - he has refused to be interviewed throughout the tour, and spends most of the three hours and 40 minutes on stage happily thrashing through his back catalogue. On the other side of the stage, Stephen Stills, Young's natural rival in the group, makes several attempts to out-perform him. </p> <p>The morning after the show, I wait for Stills in the hotel lobby. Would he agree to a few questions? 'Sure, son,' he smiles. He drums one finger against his eyebrow, 'Go on... shoot!' </p> <p>Like most lead guitarists, Stills possesses a very wide competitive streak. On originally teaming up with Crosby and Nash in 1968, he declared the trio would be named Stills Crosby-Nash. Only a threatened walkout by the other members forced him to reconsider. 'They said the name didn't roll off the tongue so easy,' he remembers. 'So I had to drop my ego for a while.' </p> <p>His pride looks wounded. In the three decades since the group's heyday, Stills's solo career has been badly outperformed by Young's. His eponymous 1970 debut album hinted at greatness, but subsequent records have been mauled by critics. </p> <p>'Did ya like the show?' he asks. 'Yeah - I thought we rocked the Garden. Just a coupla mistakes during the set.' Stills laughs, removing his baseball cap to ruffle his thinning blonde hair. 'I thought I was as tight as usual, the others will have to be cautioned.' He smiles thinly. 'I have a lot at stake in this tour. So everything has to be just right.' </p> <p>Stills would desperately like to remake CSN&amp;Y in his own image. Without Young, CS&amp;N has always remained a Stills vanity project - both Nash and Crosby are susceptible to his demands. 'I dunno,' he says. 'I mean, this is great. I'm having fun - maybe I'm just disappointed at myself sometimes. Had we not argued so much in those days, maybe each of us would be getting a lot more credit. But it seems like we just can't do it without Neil.' </p> <p>On stage, Stills and Young trade fierce guitar solos: Young's noisy and aggressive, Stills's more classical and melodic. 'Yeah, we're different,' he says. 'I gotta admit that I have a real bad temper sometimes, just liable to go off and say something really stupid. And sure, there are a ton of regrets in this band, because we've never managed to get along as humans. And maybe that's the problem - although sometimes I think that is what makes us great. Unfortunately, it's also the thing that makes the whole venture a complete pain in the ass.' </p> <p>The new album, Looking Forward, has suffered from modest sales - around 250,000 - but the tour is a sell-out, and the band seem warily pleased with themselves. 'I think we made a good record,' says Crosby. 'Not a great one - and we're all of that opinion. Neil always says that this group is too stubborn to live up to its potential. I dispute that: for these shows, we're working harder than we ever have in our lives.' </p> <p>In an era when teen acts like Westlife and Monica can barely muster enough songs for a 60-minute set, CSN&amp;Y's almost four-hour homage to their own greatness is a radical trawl through American cultural history. Like the band, not everything has aged equally well: songs such as 'Marrakesh Express' and 'Our House' sound trite in their gushing praise for San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury heyday. But when the group feels its way into 'Long May You Run', your cynicism falls away. </p> <p>A Young standard, 'Long May You Run' is now an American baby-boomer anthem. Now rebuilt to incorporate the group's soaring and damaged voices, the song is a telling indication of their battered collective psyche, and maybe that of the audience, too: </p> <p> We've been through some things together </p> <p>With trunks of memories still to come </p> <p>We've found things to do in stormy weather </p> <p>Long may you run </p> <p>Promises broken, potential unfulfilled. Is it really such a sad story? 'My generation has made a great many mistakes, but there's a lot to be said for it,' argues Crosby. He stops himself, searching for the right words. 'I'm an optimist by nature. And yeah, maybe I am an old hippie. But I think we're slowly getting to know each other again. Some old habits die hard; we're learning how to live with those, too.' </p> <p>\u0095 Looking Forward is out now; Neil Young's Silver and Gold is out 28 April (both WEA)</p>",

      "body": "<p>What's wrong with the British cinema? In a single verbless sentence: too many first films, too few second films, too many films featuring Ray Winstone and Rhys Ifans, too long a time gap between our best directors' pictures, the continuing cultural favouring of the theatre over the cinema.</p> <p>The current favourite of both the intellectuals and the chauvinistic popular press, Sam Mendes, is rightly applauded for saying that he will not allow the Oscars his first film won to affect his judgment. But is he to be praised for declaring that he has no immediate plans to make another picture and that his only allegiance is to the Donmar Warehouse, a little theatre largely devoted to revivals of classics which he runs in Covent Garden? What would we think of a Booker Prize winner who in his acceptance speech said he wasn't thinking of writing another novel in the foreseeable future because he had to give his full attention to the antique store he and his partner ran in Suffolk? </p> <p>The reason John Ford, Howard Hawks and Michael Curtiz were great directors was because they went on making movies year after year, usually several a year, in a variety of genres. Not all were good, many were routine, but all were touched by their auteur's character and vision. Ford once remarked that he made one film for himself for every three he did for the studios, but in 1939 and 1940 he directed Stagecoach, Young Mr Lincoln, Drums Along the Mohawk, The Long Voyage Home, and The Grapes of Wrath. Of course, it was easier then when the big studios were grinding out films every week to supply the chains of cinemas they owned. 'We made pictures then,' Billy Wilder has said.

      "bodyText": "What's wrong with the British cinema? In a single verbless sentence: too many first films, too few second films, too many films featuring Ray Winstone and Rhys Ifans, too long a time gap between our best directors' pictures, the continuing cultural favouring of the theatre over the cinema. The current favourite of both the intellectuals and the chauvinistic popular press, Sam Mendes, is rightly applauded for saying that he will not allow the Oscars his first film won to affect his judgment. But is he to be praised for declaring that he has no immediate plans to make another picture and that his only allegiance is to the Donmar Warehouse, a little theatre largely devoted to revivals of classics which he runs in Covent Garden? What would we think of a Booker Prize winner who in his acceptance speech said he wasn't thinking of writing another novel in the foreseeable future because he had to give his full attention to the antique store he and his partner ran in Suffolk? The reason John Ford, Howard Hawks and Michael Curtiz were great directors was because they went on making movies year after year, usually several a year, in a variety of genres. Not all were good, many were routine, but all were touched by their auteur's character and vision. Ford once remarked that he made one film for himself for every three he did for the studios, but in 1939 and 1940 he directed Stagecoach, Young Mr Lincoln, Drums Along the Mohawk, The Long Voyage Home, and The Grapes of Wrath. Of course, it was easier then when the big studios were grinding out films every week to supply the chains of cinemas they owned. 'We made pictures then,' Billy Wilder has said. 'Today we spend 80 per cent of our time making deals and 20 per cent making pictures.' Nevertheless, British filmmakers these past 40-odd years have been peculiarly costive and a tradition has grown up that it is spiritually unhealthy or artistically undignified to put your name on too many films.

That assessment sounds more ungenerous than intended. Deborah Warner's austere enactment provoked thought and therefore must be measured a success. Her approach is dignified. She respects the music. The performance, benefiting greatly from the expertise of Stephen Layton who conducted, had wholehearted commitment and made up in energy what it lacked in finesse. Mark Padmore as the Evangelist, Natalie Christie and Catherine Wyn-Rogers excelled.</p> <p>Whether or not it achieved more than a concert performance is harder to say. Forty-eight hours after watching it, I am no nearer an answer. Setting aside the tangential question of why an opera house should want to appropriate non-operatic music (these distinctions, after all, are there to be challenged), did English National Opera's experiment succeed? </p> <p>Bach wrote his setting of St John's Gospel, one of a probable five such passions of which only two survive, for church performance in Leipzig on Good Friday 1724. It is likely he gave his best singers the solo arias whereas today we tend to honour the Evangelist. It is possible, though not certain, that the congregation would have joined in the chorales, which act as musical corner stones, supporting and giving pause to the action. Even had Bach's worshippers remained silent, these familiar hymn tunes would have sung loudly in their heads and ensured their engagement with the unfolding drama of Christ's crucifixion. </p> <p>In its division of music between different solo voices and often turbulent choruses, in the vivid, rapidly changing light and dark key patterns, in the extraordinary variety of instrumental writing, Bach's work has an inherently dramatic structure (to an even greater extent than his better known St Matthew Passion). By emphasising this aspect, he followed a tradition of chanting the gospel dating back to the fourth century. Earlier settings of St John's Gospel exist, in Scandinavia and in the Lutheran Church, with instructions to priests to change altar cloths and vestments and light or extinguish candles. Theatre and liturgy have always been kindred spirits. After all, one grows out of the other, in ancient and modern times. With its Roman/Jewish confrontations and its strong portrayals of Christ and Pilate, this biblical text naturally lends itself to a quasi-operatic reading. </p> <p>So it might be argued that to perform it in an opera house is itself a natural extension. Warner, and her designer and lighting director Tom Pye and Jean Kalman, have chosen maximum simplicity. The stage is bare, with a plain screen on which subtly changing colours play. In the opening chorus, dozens of tiny light bulbs slowly descend, only to reappear at the end, acknowledging the shifts from light to darkness so carefully described in St John's Gospel. The performers dress in homespun clothes. The three crosses of Calvary are wooden poles. The scourging, smiting, piercing and crucifying exist only by suggestion augmented by an indistinct video. </p> <p>Had matters rested there, one would feel less uneasy. Yet the desire to make theatre in the end got the better of the evening. Pilate (David Kempster), for whom St John makes such a strong case, here becomes a troubled, besuited executive trying to do the right thing, rather than a dignified judge representing reason in a bat tle between spiritual light and dark prejudice. To have him manhandle Jesus (Paul Whelan) subverts the text and finds no justification in Bach's music. When Pilate asks 'And what is truth?', the resonance of this mighty question surely lies in the busy context of statement and response: one man's sane voice struggling to be heard among many. </p> <p>Instead, to leave, as here, a long silence, without the usual continuo cadence, is the equivalent of adding inverted commas, double underlining and a couple of exclamation marks for good measure. To object is not to put oneself up as a purist but rather to identify why, at that point, a wrong note (in this case no note) had been sounded.</p> <p>Nothing, however, jarred as much as the advent, in the final chorus, of someone carrying a soft, cuddly, new-born lamb on stage and placed it in the Evangelist's arms. The bleating and baah-ing brought the house down. No one needed William Hill to help them on the odds of this occurring. At this most awesome moment, when Mark Padmore had given the performance of his life, he had to suffer the indignity of holding this poor writhing, squealing creature while the audience burst into laughter. No doubt the National Agnine Defence League will soon put a stop to this. If not, the singers' union surely will. </p> <p>In the final concert of his 10-year series Towards the Millennium, Simon Rattle and the <b> CBSO</b> had commissioned a new work from Simon Holt (born 1958). In a concert which included Ligeti's ingenious Violin Concerto, persuasively played by Tasmin Little, and Tippett's lush The Rose Lake, the Holt offered bracing and concentrated complexity.</p> <p>Sunrise' yellow noise takes its title from a poem by Emily Dickinson which Holt sets for high soprano (Lisa Milne). The orchestra has no middle strings, instead using only violins and double basses. This highlights the low brass and woodwind, especially cor anglais, trombones and tuba. Offsetting their growling solidity, harp, handbells, tuned gongs and vibraphone shimmer and glisten. Calm is broken by menacing drum rolls and squealing trumpets. Within this short piece, Holt has created an intense, small-scale drama. Music's power lies in the creation and release of tension. It is the only art that can answer Pilate's great existential question.</p>",

It is likely he gave his best singers the solo arias whereas today we tend to honour the Evangelist. It is possible, though not certain, that the congregation would have joined in the chorales, which act as musical corner stones, supporting and giving pause to the action. Even had Bach's worshippers remained silent, these familiar hymn tunes would have sung loudly in their heads and ensured their engagement with the unfolding drama of Christ's crucifixion. In its division of music between different solo voices and often turbulent choruses, in the vivid, rapidly changing light and dark key patterns, in the extraordinary variety of instrumental writing, Bach's work has an inherently dramatic structure (to an even greater extent than his better known St Matthew Passion). By emphasising this aspect, he followed a tradition of chanting the gospel dating back to the fourth century. Earlier settings of St John's Gospel exist, in Scandinavia and in the Lutheran Church, with instructions to priests to change altar cloths and vestments and light or extinguish candles. Theatre and liturgy have always been kindred spirits. After all, one grows out of the other, in ancient and modern times. With its Roman/Jewish confrontations and its strong portrayals of Christ and Pilate, this biblical text naturally lends itself to a quasi-operatic reading. So it might be argued that to perform it in an opera house is itself a natural extension. Warner, and her designer and lighting director Tom Pye and Jean Kalman, have chosen maximum simplicity. The stage is bare, with a plain screen on which subtly changing colours play. In the opening chorus, dozens of tiny light bulbs slowly descend, only to reappear at the end, acknowledging the shifts from light to darkness so carefully described in St John's Gospel. The performers dress in homespun clothes. The three crosses of Calvary are wooden poles. The scourging, smiting, piercing and crucifying exist only by suggestion augmented by an indistinct video. Had matters rested there, one would feel less uneasy. Yet the desire to make theatre in the end got the better of the evening. Pilate (David Kempster), for whom St John makes such a strong case, here becomes a troubled, besuited executive trying to do the right thing, rather than a dignified judge representing reason in a bat tle between spiritual light and dark prejudice. To have him manhandle Jesus (Paul Whelan) subverts the text and finds no justification in Bach's music. When Pilate asks 'And what is truth?', the resonance of this mighty question surely lies in the busy context of statement and response: one man's sane voice struggling to be heard among many. Instead, to leave, as here, a long silence, without the usual continuo cadence, is the equivalent of adding inverted commas, double underlining and a couple of exclamation marks for good measure. To object is not to put oneself up as a purist but rather to identify why, at that point, a wrong note (in this case no note) had been sounded. Nothing, however, jarred as much as the advent, in the final chorus, of someone carrying a soft, cuddly, new-born lamb on stage and placed it in the Evangelist's arms. The bleating and baah-ing brought the house down. No one needed William Hill to help them on the odds of this occurring. At this most awesome moment, when Mark Padmore had given the performance of his life, he had to suffer the indignity of holding this poor writhing, squealing creature while the audience burst into laughter. No doubt the National Agnine Defence League will soon put a stop to this. If not, the singers' union surely will. In the final concert of his 10-year series Towards the Millennium, Simon Rattle and the CBSO had commissioned a new work from Simon Holt (born 1958). In a concert which included Ligeti's ingenious Violin Concerto, persuasively played by Tasmin Little, and Tippett's lush The Rose Lake, the Holt offered bracing and concentrated complexity. Sunrise' yellow noise takes its title from a poem by Emily Dickinson which Holt sets for high soprano (Lisa Milne). The orchestra has no middle strings, instead using only violins and double basses. This highlights the low brass and woodwind, especially cor anglais, trombones and tuba. Offsetting their growling solidity, harp, handbells, tuned gongs and vibraphone shimmer and glisten. Calm is broken by menacing drum rolls and squealing trumpets. Within this short piece, Holt has created an intense, small-scale drama. Music's power lies in the creation and release of tension. It is the only art that can answer Pilate's great existential question.",

He had the scan done to help someone with their research. It is marked with his name and date of birth (4 May, 1937). Phillips has included the despised scan to serve as a witty signature for an astonishing work of art - the first-ever electronic portrait. </p> <p>On a vertical screen, 28 inches tall with no knobs, no thicker than a canvas (properly known as an 'Apple Mac cinema display flat screen' and so new it has only been around for two or three months), a silent drama is about to unfold. Phillips's brain is beginning to give way to something else. It is sliced through with colour and becoming a woman's face. This is Susan Greenfield, professor of pharmacology at Oxford, first female director of the Royal Institution, president of the Association for Science Education, working-class heroine, the woman who is doing breakthrough research into Alzheimer's and is about to present a six-part television series on the brain for the BBC. And as if this were not enough, Greenfield is reported to be vital, enthusiastic and, at 49, glamorous too. </p> <p>As I 'watch' the portrait, her left eye at once catches my attention. It is wide open, as if surprised at what it has got itself involved in. Her hair looks electric with lightning streaks (Tipp-Ex is responsible for this effect) forking through it. Slowly, her face takes on flesh - virtual paint. But as you are starting to feel safe, even familiar, with it, the face darkens and dissolves. A black-and-white autumn arrives, made up not of leaves but of cells. Greenfield's face is the still point at the centre of incessant change - and she looks ahead steadily. Like the progress of a complicated day - her day perhaps? - light comes and goes. And then the brain beneath the skin appears, a disconcerting but beautiful sight. It is not an ending, for this is a circular portrait - it takes 10 minutes to see. </p> <p>Its pace is smooth, almost imperceptible. As Tom Phillips's wife, Fiona Maddocks remarks, it is a little like the London Eye. The portrait is made up of 24 frames a second - more than 12,000 frames in all. It was commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery and is the last - and only - new work in its exhibition: Defining Features: Scientific and Medical Portraits 1660-2000. </p> <p>Tom Phillips does not immediately appear to be a cutting-edge kind of a guy. His kitchen in Peckham, south London, is a nest of papers out of which, one feels, almost anything might hatch. It is under siege from primitive little African figures swarming up one of its walls. It is like a post-office sorting-room, piled high with postcards collected for a book which will span the century. The house seems organic rather than mechanical. </p> <p>The only obviously groovy objects are Phillips's large blue-green spectacles. In Susan Greenfield's lab, he was drawn to the photographs of the things she works on - the neurological patterns related to Alzheimer's, for example.He took photos of these himself which he then 'treated' and which form part of the portrait. </p> <p>The portrait is a collaborative effort. It could not have happened without Jonathan Hills who runs Matelot, a TV and film post-production company. Hills and Phillips are friends. (They worked together on the film TV Dante which won the Prix D'Italia). Hills has provided expensive equipment and two designers, Jim Allen and Farella Dove, who have assisted on the project which took six months to complete. 'Tom was very hands-on,' says Hills, 'knowing how to manipulate images on screen.' He was impressed but not surprised, for Phillips is a 'maverick': painter, poet, translator, collector and composer. Hills observes: 'He has always been interested in interdisciplinary work.' </p> <p>Susan Greenfield suited this new departure in portraiture partly because: 'It was hard to find a day when she wasn't lecturing in Edinburgh or receiving the Nobel Prize.' As it was, she gave up 10 hours for sittings - 'which is more than the Queen gives,' says Phillips. Still, he wanted to break free of the 'dour business' of portraiture. Conventional portraits take him about a year. (He has painted among others Iris Murdoch and Salman Rushdie and is currently failing to finish a portrait of Richard Eyre.) </p> <p>Phillips's idea was that the Greenfield portrait would be about the business of creating a portrait. Nothing would be wasted. He used sketches, a video, photographs - more than 200 bits of artwork. Jonathan Hills explains: 'These works were scanned at high resolution and have been choreographed so that each image becomes the next.' It is an idea that Phillips finds sympathetic. He seems to prefer work-in-progress to finished articles. He is a questing person and complacent about nothing - except his ping-pong skills. </p> <p>The portrait will hang in the conventional way. There will even be a 'one-off frame' (designed by Callum Sporrie) to subvert the computer's plasticky look. The screen has also been disguised, turned from landscape to portrait shape. He dubs the portrait a 'changie' (as opposed to a movie). He loves its volatility. He likens it to the way you can be surprised by people you live with - whose faces never stay the same. He found Susan Greenfield, 'a vivid person. There was no need to elicit a dormant personality. She puts a lot on the surface - in a good way. Whatever it is, she's got it - a kind of evangelicalism. She is some bright woman'.</p> <p>Was it scary showing the work to her? 'No, because she is an experimenter and it is an experiment.' Every portrait begins with a question: 'You have to ask: what do people look like? What is their essence? You confront people's vanity. When people have to sit like lemons for two hours, vanity drops away... You go through the skin and forever after you know what the person looks like.' </p> <p>I ring Susan Greenfield. She is at Heathrow, waiting to catch a plane to South Africa. She says she and Tom first met as if 'on a blind date' and had tea at Fortnums. Later, she enjoyed sitting for the portrait in his cottage in Oxford. It was 'bizarre' to sit still and talk. Her life is not made up of casual conversations any longer. When she saw an early version of the portrait she was 'quite flattered' by it' - as long as it was viewed from a distance. Her parents would love to own it. 'I wouldn't want to inflict it on my husband,' she laughs. Tom consoled her with the thought that the moments she disliked would not last. It is, she thinks, 'a good metaphor for life: everything must change to become itself again'. </p> <p>But she is still not reconciled to her wrinkles. Wouldn't wrinkles be a particular hazard in this portrait with a very wrinkly brain on show? She laughs and but says: 'The brain is the most beautiful part of the body' and rushed on to add that the older you get, 'the more beautiful the brain becomes' as its connections 'reflect you with increasing idiosyncrasy'. Perhaps Tom Phillips should take another, more admiring, look at that scan of his. </p> <p>\u0095 Defining Features: Scientific and Medical Portraits 1660-2000 at the National Portrait Gallery, London WC2 opens on Saturday</p>",

There will even be a 'one-off frame' (designed by Callum Sporrie) to subvert the computer's plasticky look. The screen has also been disguised, turned from landscape to portrait shape. He dubs the portrait a 'changie' (as opposed to a movie). He loves its volatility. He likens it to the way you can be surprised by people you live with - whose faces never stay the same. He found Susan Greenfield, 'a vivid person. There was no need to elicit a dormant personality. She puts a lot on the surface - in a good way. Whatever it is, she's got it - a kind of evangelicalism. She is some bright woman'. Was it scary showing the work to her? 'No, because she is an experimenter and it is an experiment.' Every portrait begins with a question: 'You have to ask: what do people look like? What is their essence? You confront people's vanity. When people have to sit like lemons for two hours, vanity drops away... You go through the skin and forever after you know what the person looks like.' I ring Susan Greenfield. She is at Heathrow, waiting to catch a plane to South Africa. She says she and Tom first met as if 'on a blind date' and had tea at Fortnums. Later, she enjoyed sitting for the portrait in his cottage in Oxford. It was 'bizarre' to sit still and talk. Her life is not made up of casual conversations any longer. When she saw an early version of the portrait she was 'quite flattered' by it' - as long as it was viewed from a distance. Her parents would love to own it. 'I wouldn't want to inflict it on my husband,' she laughs. Tom consoled her with the thought that the moments she disliked would not last. It is, she thinks, 'a good metaphor for life: everything must change to become itself again'. But she is still not reconciled to her wrinkles. Wouldn't wrinkles be a particular hazard in this portrait with a very wrinkly brain on show? She laughs and but says: 'The brain is the most beautiful part of the body' and rushed on to add that the older you get, 'the more beautiful the brain becomes' as its connections 'reflect you with increasing idiosyncrasy'. Perhaps Tom Phillips should take another, more admiring, look at that scan of his. \u0095 Defining Features: Scientific and Medical Portraits 1660-2000 at the National Portrait Gallery, London WC2 opens on Saturday",

      "body": "<p>Dear Monty <br>I hate my garden. The previous owners of the house got in a garden designer who created a low-maintenance, lawn-based garden which looks just fine, and the few plants are beautifully chosen - the problem is that it is not really me. You see, in summer and autumn I spend my life outside, I write and eat in the garden every day if I can, and I need a space that is simply a pleasure to be in, rather than something that has been designed purely to be easy to look after.</p> <p>Right now, it is 90 per cent lawn and some rather beautiful clematis. I feel as if the garden is sleeping, an opportunity for pleasure being wasted. In practice, it is a nothing more than a typical 'urban rectangle', but I know it could be a joy to be in. I am just not sure where to start. All I know is that this garden could be very pleasant - secluded, fragrant and, if you like, a sanctuary. That is what I want. I am not a fan of the instant gardens you see on television makeovers, which is why I am seeking out a gardener rather than a garden designer.</p> <p>I need an outside space for myself, my friends, and my cats, that slowly evolves, rather than simply springing up in full bloom over a weekend. I really don't have a clue where to start. Any ideas? I've enclosed lists of things I love and loathe. <br>Best wishes <br>Nigel</p> <p>Dear Nigel <br>Thanks for your notes. I am glad they are notes and not a fully formed ideal of a garden, because as soon as you transcend the limitations of mere horticulture, all good gardening is subjective. To achieve a place that you like very much is the supreme achievement. Why you like it seems to me to be as absurd as judging someone by their favourite foods. I always feel that making a garden is like writing a daily journal - it is private and unexpurgated, yet invariably intended, at some level, for another's eyes. Where you walk the line between public and private is probably what makes the garden most interesting. What you have done is a blueprint for anybody starting out to make a garden. You certainly do not need any help from a garden designer, just some willing and skilled hands.</p> <p>It is important to stress that I am not a garden designer and have no pretensions to be so. I have designed gardens in the past, but I know my own limitations and I can only really sustain the proper level of interest if I imagine that the garden were my own.</p> <p>Clearly, this degree of egocentricity is a bit limiting, to say the least, but it does go back to my central tenet of what makes a garden worthwhile, which is the extent to which it is an expression of its maker and keeper. I cannot transcend my own strong opinions as to what makes a garden worth having. I am bored by the clever and glib. I want aesthetic beauty in the garden. Loveliness is all.</p> <p>I also think that a lovely garden evolves out of the mess of its creation - as much human error as physical happenstance. The clich\u00e9 that we learn most from our mistakes is never so applicable as in a garden.</p> <p>Although these are notes, I'll take them exactly as written, with their groupings and stanzas, because I am sure that the associates are important and probably deliberate.</p> <p>You say: 'The garden faces south-west and gets good sun for most of the day, especially after midday. It is a windy site, particularly the rear of the house. The garden lacks privacy and is badly exposed to neighbouring gardens. Access for skips and large delivery vehicles is a problem. There is a row of two-storey houses at the bottom of the garden, about 10ft from the garden wall. It would be nice to see a little less of them. The garden currently lacks a compost bin. I am good at daily maintenance, weeding, deadheading, but not very good at implementing larger plans.'</p> <p>For years, I was confused when people said that a garden 'faced' such and such a direction: it seemed too arbitrary - which bit of the garden faced that way? What that really means is 'the side of the house that overlooks the garden faces south-west', and this is a more useful clue for how people will use this garden rather than plants. You, Nigel, are a south-west-facing gardener. This means you can sit outside and enjoy the sun for most of the day, except, perhaps, the early morning. If you make your eating area just outside the house (the instinctive thing to do), you might be pushed to breakfast with the sun in your eyes, but the sun will slowly set on your dinner and blaze on your lunch.</p> <p>This is a vital issue. The prime purpose of a garden, beyond a place to garden in, is as a place to eat. If you never dine at home, then it hardly matters where the sun is in the evening. If you often eat lunch outside - as I do - then direct midday sun is too hot and melts the butter. Either you have to create some shade or re-site your eating area. But the evening sun is less fierce, and if you have it right outside your back door, I would thank heaven and use it as the basis for your garden. Eat where it shines.</p> <p>But you say that the rear of the house is windy, so it is vital to screen out that wind immediately. I would have a short, medium and long anti-wind strategy. Trellis reaching 2m right round the garden would be my first move. This will filter the wind, provide support for climbers and give some privacy (a surprising amount) without being overtly hostile to your neighbours. This won't be cheap, but it's worth every penny. Then I would put a hedge, or hedges, laterally across the garden to absorb the wind coming straight down at the house. Their position is a vital part of the design.</p> <p>I would go for a deciduous hedge for the seasonal change and in midwinter - when the leaves are bare - you are much less likely to be eating out on a windy day. I think the privacy issue can be broken into sections. Although it would be nice, it is not perhaps essential to be wholly private in every inch of the garden. But there must be at least one area that you can relax in that is totally private, even if it is only large enough for a single seat. The dividing hedge would add to this containment of privacy, and you can use it for what I call the ostrich effect. This is to say that one worries a lot less about who is watching you if you cannot see them.</p> <p>I would also plant some trees as long-term wind breaks. People underestimate the value of trees in a town garden, and consequently miss out on a lot. But these trees would be young and take a few years to work as a windbreak. I would suggest that a gentle screen from the houses at the end of your garden would evolve as the trees grew.</p> <p>I like the way the absence of a compost bin comes so high in your notes, but this is no problem. Compost depends upon the mechanics - and is the surest indicator - of a smoothly running garden. Do you have a compost bin in the kitchen? This is perhaps more relevant. I find containers for compost unhelpful - better to allocate an area down the end that has some bays where you can make compost, put weeds and turf.</p> <p>It is good that you recognise what you are good at and like doing in the garden. This is a vital part of making the garden in your image. I would say that you have the balance exactly right - although this is the antithesis of the quick-fix, makeover image of gardening. It means that you could get people in to put the garden in place, but you could take on the business of actually gardening - which is where most of the pleasure lies.</p> <p>'I would like to keep the robinia and the fig. The stone paving outside the kitchen will be used for eating most of the year, and could be extended further into the garden. At some point, I intend to have the three steps from the house rebuilt. An automatic watering system would be an enormous help.'</p> <p>I agree about the robinia and fig, although both want to have as much sun as possible, and both are eminently moveable, so it is worth considering if they are in the 'right' place. My own feeling is that the robinia is not worth moving, but that the fig would be better against the house, where it could spread more and the warmth off the walls would ripen the fruit better. I agree about an automatic watering system. Even if you like watering and only use it as a back-up, it is a good idea.</p> <p>'I like symmetry, and I would very much like some of the garden to be quite smart and formal. I adore fragrant gardens that you can sit in at night with a drink. I love the crunch of gravel.'</p> <p>I agree completely. I suggest that you make the area that is now lawn a box-edged herb garden with gravel paths and the herbs supplemented with bulbs, wallflowers, poppies, tobacco plants, night-scented stock, bay, box and a few wonderful old roses.</p> <p>The secret of fragrance in the garden is to make the scent come to you and not vice versa. Once you have worked out where you will sit, then plant around it with the scents you love. The paved area is the obvious starting point, so plant climbers against the house, such as Clematis armandii, honeysuckle and your favourite scented climbing rose. Pots and planters can be filled with scent - paperwhites, hyacinths,violets, lilies, sweet peas, white jasmine. The beauty of pots is that the theme can be literally moved around. I would also have another seat in the garden, away from the house, which is surrounded by a favourite fragrance and which is less formal and softer, where you can take a cup of coffee or the paper.</p> <p>'I like box hedging; box balls; gravel chippings; voluptuous planting; stone balls; modern garden sculpture; very dark evergreens; very dark greens; deep claret, amber, copper and jewel-coloured flowers; white; garden lighting; privacy; heavy scents; climbing plants; arbours; hidden seats; fruit and herbs; Versailles planters; trellis. A few plants I am particularly fond of are box, bergenia, peonies, globe artichokes, tall alliums, fluffy plumes of grasses, nicotiana, camellias, crocosmia, dark ivy, 'Christmas trees', red chard, echinops, rue, bronze sage, bronze fennel, Nigella damascena, Viburnum tinus, camellias, pumpkins, bamboo, violas, monarda, narcissi, large-flowered single clematis, climbing roses, honeysuckle, phlox, poppies, foxgloves, hollyhocks, gypsophila, flag iris, ferns.'</p> <p>This list makes it easy to understand what you want from your garden. My own would pretty much overlap (you might like to come and see this garden in July/August - a lot of your list would be in full sail), although I cannot begin to see the attractions of camellias, 'Christmas trees' or bergenias. Work out what you like and focus clearly on those things, because you cannot have everything. Ruthless editing is essential, even among your likes. Exuberant simplicity always works in a small garden.</p> <p>To accommodate the full range of your floral favourites, you will need more than just the formal herb garden bit beyond the paved area. My own preference is for cultivated ground above grass. Lawns always seem to me to be an overrated luxury - lovely if you have the space, but not at the expense of flowers. I would take the area beyond the apple trees (which, on balance, I would keep) and make it all border save for a brick (or gravel) square in the middle and a few narrow access paths with a seat in a bower at the end. Fill this area with all the rich colours that you love.</p> <p>There is no need to do all of this in one go. The great advantage of grass is that it is an ideal protective covering and can be cut into at any time to make the borders. On the other hand, there is a lot to be said for making all your mess in one fell swoop - particularly as it all has to go through the house. The soil for this area must be well dug, but the turf can be lifted and laid (upside down) at the bottom of each spit of soil and will be an effective conditioner . 'I have a fancy for gooseberries, an espalier-type fruit tree along the warm wall between the fig and the house, rhubarb, herbs, cavolo nero and red chard, runner beans, currants.'</p> <p>All this can be incorporated into what I have called the herb garden. Gooseberries look great as standards, chard and cavolo nero are as decorative as many a flower, runner beans will make excellent centrepieces for the box-lined beds (although you will have to dig pits for them and add lots of organic material; they need a moisture-retentive soil). Perhaps the currants would be best at the end of the garden, as red and white currants grow perfectly well in shade.</p> <p>'I am not fond of ponds, variegated leaves, very shiny leaves such as some of the larger laurels, or taking cuttings.' Then you would be crazy to have a pond or a single variegated leaf on your estate.</p> <p>I am surprised that you like camellias and yet dislike very shiny leaves - it is the contrast between the shiny green leaves and the tissue texture of the flowers that makes them hard to admire for me. I am sad that you have not yet found the incredible satisfaction to be had from successful cuttings. I bet you a meal of your choice that this will happen some time in the near future.</p> <p>'I loathe alpines, cacti, rockeries, decking.' Alpines are lovely in the Alps and cacti stunningly beautiful in the Mexican desert. Rockeries are a bit silly, although a few attain silliness of such epic proportions that they become admirable. The only decking I have seen that looked good was attached to a building in Jamaica that was built on a steep slope, therefore making it into a verandah. It was a ridiculous fad made popular by the ease with which TV companies could install it for makeover programmes. So what have you got?<br> 1. A large paved area for eating, with pots filled with your favourite scented plants. All wild flowers, such as primroses, narcissi, etc look great in terracotta pots, too. <br>2. This leads to a formal herb garden mixed with scented flowers and some veg, made up of small beds, each edged with a clipped box and divided by narrow gravel paths. A box hedge goes right to the edge of the paving slabs and is allowed to grow rather taller than the others, perhaps 3ft. The colours in this area are pale - not a white garden as such, but silvery and cool. For height, you can have wigwams of runner beans, sweet peas and clematis. Fruit growing against the side trellis. <br>3. You go on down the central gravel path through a gap in a dividing hedge (I would plant hornbeam) with the apple trees either side (now at the back of a border) through which you pass into a richly coloured flower garden, backed by another hedge. Narrow lateral paths lead to a seat on either side. The plants spill over the paths in summer. <br>4. Through another gap in another hedge to an area at the end of the garden that is a wilder woodland garden which houses the compost as well as currant bushes, and woodland/spring flowers, such as snowdrops, aconites, primroses, bluebells, hellebores, in a more naturalistic setting. <br>5. The whole garden surrounded by a high trellis, covered with clematis, honeysuckle, wisteria, vines, roses, ivies, and whatever grabs your fancy. <br>6. There is a view right down the centre of the garden, but from nowhere at ground level can you see the whole garden. From the upper stories, it is all laid out beneath you with symmetry and strong structure.</p> <p>Plan of action <br>1. Mark out the whole garden, establishing the placing of terracing, paths, hedges and borders. <br>2. Start to buy your plants now - slowly and thoughtfully. Keep them in pots on the paved area, and start to think about their plant grouping. <br>3. Bring in your trellis and get it put up properly, ie very firmly. <br>4. Take out grass as slabs of turf where the paths and borders are to go and make a neat heap of it at the end of the garden with the turves stacked in layers, grass side to grass side. Most of this will be dug back into the borders and the residue will make wonderful potting compost in a year or so. <br>5. Extend the terrace. <br>6. Dig out your paths, putting the topsoil in a heap on one side. Bring in scalpings/ hardcore and lay it between edging boards to make the paths. Get this firm and level with a vibrating plate. You can then either put a thin layer of gravel on top (the thinner the better) or wait until all the mess is over before finishing the paths. <br>7. Dig your borders. Put the turves, grass side down, in the bottom of each trench before covering with the soil from the next trench. Don't scrimp on this work - the success of the garden depends on it more than any other factor. Level the soil off and fork or rotovate in a layer of mushroom or proprietary organic compost. <br>8. Plant your hedges. Make sure these are done properly, with good trenches and lots of organic matter. Water them in really well. <br>9. Put in the irrigation system, including a porous pipe along each hedge. <br>10. Plant your borders, climbers, etc. <br>11. Make your compost heap. <br>12. Start gardening. <br>Good luck! <br>Best wishes <br>Monty</p> <p>Dear Monty <br>Thank you for notes and plans. They have brought extreme pleasure (I can almost picture the garden already), but also a feeling of mild panic at the prospect. I feel edgy and excited about it. It would be so easy to just mow the existing lawn every few weeks. But I get no pleasure from my garden: it just sits there encased in lawn like an unopened present, a sort of virgin aunt.</p> <p>I hadn't thought about your idea of hedging to break the garden up into rooms, but it makes such sense. Not just visually, but also practically. Although this is by no means a large garden it is still, to a relatively new gardener like myself, slightly daunting. Having several smaller areas I can work on individually may well help my feeling of being overwhelmed by the physical work involved.</p> <p>I am relieved that we like so many of the same plants. One part of this project that is so exciting is working out which plants will work together in the formal boxes and the 'middle garden'. I say this particularly as we are mixing vegetables, fruit, herbs and flowers in the same beds, which is, for me, one of the greatest delights of the whole design.</p> <p>We must think of a way to let the cats get access to the walls - they like to walk along them and survey their territory - so we may end up with gaps in the trellis where they can jump through. This is also presumably where the foxes who sometimes play on the lawn early in the morning will gain access. <br>Best wishes <br>Nigel</p>",

My own would pretty much overlap (you might like to come and see this garden in July/August - a lot of your list would be in full sail), although I cannot begin to see the attractions of camellias, 'Christmas trees' or bergenias. Work out what you like and focus clearly on those things, because you cannot have everything. Ruthless editing is essential, even among your likes. Exuberant simplicity always works in a small garden. To accommodate the full range of your floral favourites, you will need more than just the formal herb garden bit beyond the paved area. My own preference is for cultivated ground above grass. Lawns always seem to me to be an overrated luxury - lovely if you have the space, but not at the expense of flowers. I would take the area beyond the apple trees (which, on balance, I would keep) and make it all border save for a brick (or gravel) square in the middle and a few narrow access paths with a seat in a bower at the end. Fill this area with all the rich colours that you love. There is no need to do all of this in one go. The great advantage of grass is that it is an ideal protective covering and can be cut into at any time to make the borders. On the other hand, there is a lot to be said for making all your mess in one fell swoop - particularly as it all has to go through the house. The soil for this area must be well dug, but the turf can be lifted and laid (upside down) at the bottom of each spit of soil and will be an effective conditioner . 'I have a fancy for gooseberries, an espalier-type fruit tree along the warm wall between the fig and the house, rhubarb, herbs, cavolo nero and red chard, runner beans, currants.' All this can be incorporated into what I have called the herb garden. Gooseberries look great as standards, chard and cavolo nero are as decorative as many a flower, runner beans will make excellent centrepieces for the box-lined beds (although you will have to dig pits for them and add lots of organic material; they need a moisture-retentive soil). Perhaps the currants would be best at the end of the garden, as red and white currants grow perfectly well in shade. 'I am not fond of ponds, variegated leaves, very shiny leaves such as some of the larger laurels, or taking cuttings.' Then you would be crazy to have a pond or a single variegated leaf on your estate. I am surprised that you like camellias and yet dislike very shiny leaves - it is the contrast between the shiny green leaves and the tissue texture of the flowers that makes them hard to admire for me. I am sad that you have not yet found the incredible satisfaction to be had from successful cuttings. I bet you a meal of your choice that this will happen some time in the near future. 'I loathe alpines, cacti, rockeries, decking.' Alpines are lovely in the Alps and cacti stunningly beautiful in the Mexican desert. Rockeries are a bit silly, although a few attain silliness of such epic proportions that they become admirable. The only decking I have seen that looked good was attached to a building in Jamaica that was built on a steep slope, therefore making it into a verandah. It was a ridiculous fad made popular by the ease with which TV companies could install it for makeover programmes. So what have you got? 1. A large paved area for eating, with pots filled with your favourite scented plants. All wild flowers, such as primroses, narcissi, etc look great in terracotta pots, too. 2. This leads to a formal herb garden mixed with scented flowers and some veg, made up of small beds, each edged with a clipped box and divided by narrow gravel paths. A box hedge goes right to the edge of the paving slabs and is allowed to grow rather taller than the others, perhaps 3ft. The colours in this area are pale - not a white garden as such, but silvery and cool. For height, you can have wigwams of runner beans, sweet peas and clematis. Fruit growing against the side trellis. 3. You go on down the central gravel path through a gap in a dividing hedge (I would plant hornbeam) with the apple trees either side (now at the back of a border) through which you pass into a richly coloured flower garden, backed by another hedge. Narrow lateral paths lead to a seat on either side. The plants spill over the paths in summer. 4. Through another gap in another hedge to an area at the end of the garden that is a wilder woodland garden which houses the compost as well as currant bushes, and woodland/spring flowers, such as snowdrops, aconites, primroses, bluebells, hellebores, in a more naturalistic setting. 5. The whole garden surrounded by a high trellis, covered with clematis, honeysuckle, wisteria, vines, roses, ivies, and whatever grabs your fancy. 6. There is a view right down the centre of the garden, but from nowhere at ground level can you see the whole garden. From the upper stories, it is all laid out beneath you with symmetry and strong structure. Plan of action 1. Mark out the whole garden, establishing the placing of terracing, paths, hedges and borders. 2. Start to buy your plants now - slowly and thoughtfully. Keep them in pots on the paved area, and start to think about their plant grouping. 3. Bring in your trellis and get it put up properly, ie very firmly. 4. Take out grass as slabs of turf where the paths and borders are to go and make a neat heap of it at the end of the garden with the turves stacked in layers, grass side to grass side. Most of this will be dug back into the borders and the residue will make wonderful potting compost in a year or so. 5. Extend the terrace. 6. Dig out your paths, putting the topsoil in a heap on one side. Bring in scalpings/ hardcore and lay it between edging boards to make the paths. Get this firm and level with a vibrating plate. You can then either put a thin layer of gravel on top (the thinner the better) or wait until all the mess is over before finishing the paths. 7. Dig your borders. Put the turves, grass side down, in the bottom of each trench before covering with the soil from the next trench. Don't scrimp on this work - the success of the garden depends on it more than any other factor. Level the soil off and fork or rotovate in a layer of mushroom or proprietary organic compost. 8. Plant your hedges. Make sure these are done properly, with good trenches and lots of organic matter. Water them in really well. 9. Put in the irrigation system, including a porous pipe along each hedge. 10. Plant your borders, climbers, etc. 11. Make your compost heap. 12. Start gardening. Good luck! Best wishes Monty Dear Monty Thank you for notes and plans. They have brought extreme pleasure (I can almost picture the garden already), but also a feeling of mild panic at the prospect. I feel edgy and excited about it. It would be so easy to just mow the existing lawn every few weeks. But I get no pleasure from my garden: it just sits there encased in lawn like an unopened present, a sort of virgin aunt. I hadn't thought about your idea of hedging to break the garden up into rooms, but it makes such sense. Not just visually, but also practically. Although this is by no means a large garden it is still, to a relatively new gardener like myself, slightly daunting. Having several smaller areas I can work on individually may well help my feeling of being overwhelmed by the physical work involved. I am relieved that we like so many of the same plants. One part of this project that is so exciting is working out which plants will work together in the formal boxes and the 'middle garden'. I say this particularly as we are mixing vegetables, fruit, herbs and flowers in the same beds, which is, for me, one of the greatest delights of the whole design. We must think of a way to let the cats get access to the walls - they like to walk along them and survey their territory - so we may end up with gaps in the trellis where they can jump through. This is also presumably where the foxes who sometimes play on the lawn early in the morning will gain access. Best wishes Nigel",

Her boss, played by Finney as a decent, plodding liberal realist, is the acceptable face of the law and Erin's efforts brought the firm more than $100m and herself a $2m bonus. The movie does, however, show something of the price Erin paid for her dedication - the neglect of her kids (the consequences in real life were more serious than the film implies) and the estrangement of her lover, a kindly biker (Aaron Eckhart) who looks after her children. This neighbour, whom Erin initially misjudges in the way other people misread her, represents the rejection of the very social involvement that has become her road to salvation.",

There are few mainstream precedents for its serious treatment in a lower-class milieu - off-hand only John Dexter's rarely screened 1972 I Want What I Want and Neil Jordan's The Crying Game come to mind. </p> <p>So Kimberly Peirce's <strong> Boys Don't Cry</strong>, based quite closely on a real-life murder case of 1993, seems both brave and unusual. Looking like an attractive combination of Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, Hilary Swank plays Teena Brandon, a 20-year-old girl from a Nebraska trailer park who wishes to become a man.</p> <p>She cuts off her hair, straps down her breasts, pads out her crotch and, equipped with false ID, goes to a roller-disco as Brandon Teena. The disguise works, though when her identity is twigged she's pursued back to the family trailer by angry boys, and warned by her brother of the dangers she's running. Paying no heed, she bumps into a single mother, Candace, in a bar, provokes a fight with a belligerent trucker, and is saved by Candace's roughneck friends, John and Tom. </p> <p>She takes off with them for the run-down town of Falls City 75 miles away, where she's accepted for what she appears to be by the guys, and proves attractive to the girls. At a karaoke session in a garish bar, she's drawn to the sad teenage beauty, Lana (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny), a factory worker with an alcoholic mother. Lana is part of a trio singing 'The Bluest Eyes of Texas' and Brandon is smitten. But it's another country song that comes to mind - 'Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places' - and that's precisely what Brandon is doing in wanting to be one of the boys in this rough macho world. Her criminal past and current offences - for forgery, auto theft and larceny - are bound to catch up with her and expose her deception. </p> <p>It's possible that the women might react sympathetically and that Lana could agree with Joe E. Brown that 'nobody's perfect'. But John and Tom, a pair of criminal psychopaths reminiscent of Hickock and Smith in Capote's In Cold Blood, are likely to get lethally brutal when they're made to look foolish and have their own sexuality challenged. </p> <p>The director uses the tiresome device of speeding up time, turning night traffic into a strip of yellow light and racing the clouds across the sky. But she's good, and unpatronising on the empty, desperate milieu, and the performance she gets from Hilary Swank deserved its Oscar. Swank's Brandon is notable for generosity, tenderness and consideration. No wonder the girls respond - there aren't many men like that in Falls City. </p> <p>Known, if at all, for his obscure, Beckettian fable Happy Days, the Russian director Alexei Balabanov has come up with one of the most impressive Eastern European films of the past decade. <strong> Brother</strong> is a cool, laconic thriller in the style of Kurosawa's Yojimbo and Leone's Fistful of Dollars, except that instead of being set in a corrupt, mythic past it takes place in a lawless present-day St Petersburg where Danila (Sergei Bodrov), a handsome, recently demobbed soldier, comes in search of his older brother Viktor (Viktor Sukhorukov). The boys' father died in the Gulag, and Viktor, a shaven-headed hard man, is a Mafia assassin. But he turns out to be nothing compared with the apparently mild-mannered, rock-loving Danila. </p> <p>Danila claims to have been 'a clerk at HQ' whose only experience with guns was on the firing range. His ability to deliver knockout blows, handle firearms, adapt shotguns, carry out killings, prepare explosives and bullets and absorb pain suggests otherwise. He has clearly been with the special forces in Chechnya. But he's a man of his word who looks out for the insulted and injured, protecting an elderly German street-trader from young thugs, helping an abused wife, confronting the Mafia. </p> <p>Straying into a bohemian party, Danila catches a glimpse of a different, relaxed cultured world to which he cannot belong. As he walks through Putin's degraded Leningrad and along the Neva, we get a sense of a beautiful, temporarily lost world that his vengeful spirit seeks to restore. At the end, in the manner of a Western gunfighter, he hitches a ride out of town on a lorry driving through a deserted, snow-covered landscape into an uncertain future. </p> <p>Seeing Brother immediately after Dominic Anciano and Ray Burdis's comic crime movie <strong> Love, Honour and Obey</strong> reminded me of a letter Raymond Chandler wrote to his publisher in 1946 about the film of The Big Sleep. 'Alan Ladd is a small boy's idea of a tough guy,' he said. 'Bogart is the genuine article.' Made in the same improvisatory mode as their Final Cut, with a cast of actor friends using their own names, Love, Honour and Obey stars Jonny Lee Miller as Jonny, a psychopath who works his way into a north London gang headed by plump, karaoke-loving Ray Winstone, becomes the most dangerous hoodlum in town and provokes a war with the south London crew led by Sean Pertwee. </p> <p>It comes over as a wretched home movie in which the cast are undergoing a form of therapy by acting out their sadistic fantasies of being ruthless criminals and sexually insatiable molls. As two henchmen, Anciano and Burdis spend their time discussing the latter's impotence, a matter that reaches a climax, as it were, with the gang taking an overdose of Viagra and committing a robbery disguised as Arab sheikhs, their robes thrust out by massive erections. For some reason two actors, Rhys Ifans and Denise Van Outen, are allowed to perform under aliases. </p> <p>Nearly as tiresome as Love, Honour and Obey, but much better acted, <strong> Hurly Burly</strong> is a film version of David Rabe's play about a quartet of loathsome Hollywood types - three producers (Sean Penn, Gary Shandling, Kevin Spacey) and a failing actor (Chazz Palminteri). They lounge around drinking, smoking, snorting coke and talking inane twaddle. They constantly repeat what they or someone else has just said, and twice in the picture likeable, vulnerable women are left alone at night beside a remote road, in one case thrown from a moving car. If someone put a gun to my head and threatened to pull the trigger if I refused to see this film again I'd ask for time to think it over. </p> <p><strong> The Carriers Are Waiting</strong>, the feature debut of Belgian documentarist Benot Mariage, is a strange, sad comedy about a pathetic photo-journalist (Benot Poelvoorde) working for a paper ironically called L'Espoir (hope) in a declining mining town and determined to change his life. His ludicrous plans to win a car depend on his teenage son getting into the Guinness Book of Records for opening and closing a door the most times in 24 hours. The dreamy, unemployed lad would rather achieve fame as a Presley impersonator and expert on movie continuity errors for a local radio station, and Dad's plans go tragically awry. This monochrome picture is inventive and visually striking (there's a fantastic image of thousands of racing pigeons being released from a railway siding), but it's more painful than funny. A genuine curiosity.</p>",

Before I went pro, I was a game designer. The turning point was when I went to this tournament in Dallas, and won! And I beat Sujoy to win. By one point. With five seconds to go. Ha. He was frustrated to lose because he didn't think I was any good. I didn't think I was any good. Nobody did. It was just a weird day. The $10,000 prize is the most anyone has won playing games.</p> <p>After that, everything changed. Sujoy and I became better friends, and after being at this huge event and feeling like some kind of champion, I couldn't be bothered to sit in an office. With huge companies supporting it and the prize money, you could sense it was going to become really big. So I started thinking, 'It would be great to do this as a living.' Sujoy was saying the same thing on his web page. So we started emailing each other.</p> <p>I'm not really a geek. It's a horrible generalisation, but typical computer-geek people aren't very good at games. The best players are 'normalish' people. For now, I'm happy playing games. My friends think it's a bit weird, but my parents are amazingly supportive. My dad was always very anti-gaming. So when I left a well-paid job, with security, I was expecting a bit of an earful, but he was cool and gave me loads of advice. In the long term, I can see us concentrating on the website. You get to a point when your reflexes are going and you're just not good enough any more. Burnout.</p> <p><b>Sujoy Roy</b><br> In January, I was sitting at work at JP Morgan, on the fast track for Cambridge grads, bored, not really doing much, dealing in the derivatives market, suits and bureaucracy all around me. I thought: 'What do I want out of life? If I've got a chance to do something I enjoy, then yeah, why don't I do it?' So I decided to try and make it as a pro-gamer. The Americans already have big money leagues, and gaming stars and organise these massive tournaments. Why couldn't the UK? Within weeks I'd teamed up with Hakeem, got a sponsorship deal, and was on The Big Breakfast with Johnny Vaughan taking the piss out of me.</p> <p>We signed two main sponsors: a peripherals manufacturer, Razer, which has this gaming mouse called the Boomslang, and a gaming website, <a href=\"http://www.gameplay.com\" target\"_new\">gameplay.com</a>, for a year. We do our own business deals and we managed to negotiate a six-figure sum.</p> <p>We've become like minor celebrities. We get a lot of attention at tournaments. We seem to have a lot of influence on the gaming community. People want to use anything we use - our mice, headphones, computers. We published the way we configure our PCs on our website and rolled in more than 300,000 hits on that alone. Normally, we get a few million visitors a month and we spend a lot of time answering questions and chatting online.</p> <p>Before we teamed up, we spent most of our time putting each other down. Hakeem just loves to complain. He bad-mouths everyone. There's a lot of rivalry on the scene: Brits hate Americans and Swedish. Americans hate Canadians and Euros.</p> <p>Living together is cool. We don't fight about domestics. He puts his Frosties in the sink a lot, but that's about it. But being in the house 24/7 drives me crazy. We need to get out of the flat, especially now we've bought this 100in video projector - we could be sitting at home watching DVDs all the time. So we got an office space which we've gutted and filled with technology and invite people round. It's better than sitting on your own and playing. But I like to go out and drink as much as possible.</p> <p>At the moment we are training for a tournament next weekend in Dallas. There's $100,000 in prizes. Six of us from our clan are going. Training for it is hard, because Hakeem flips when he loses. I'm comfortable with it. You win some, you lose some. A good Quake player needs co-ordination, speed, patience, confidence. But most of all, you have to stay calm. You're not going to have the reflexes of a 16-year-old, so psychology is a huge factor. You may not be able to out-draw your opponent, but you can out-think him. </p> <p>I definitely want to continue playing games. It's going to go more mainstream this year, especially with PlayStation 2 coming out. It'll be easy to get online and play multiplayer. Everyone will be doing it. Big companies are going to get involved. There's never been a better time to be in gaming but, secretly, I'm just pleased I don't have to get up in the morning. </p> <p>\u0095 Roy and Hakeem's website is at <a href=\"http://www.xsreality.com\" target\"_new\">www.xsreality.com</a> Coverage of this weekend's tournament can be found at <a href=\"http://www.razercpl.com\" target\"_new\">razercpl.com</a></p>",

You get to a point when your reflexes are going and you're just not good enough any more. Burnout. Sujoy Roy In January, I was sitting at work at JP Morgan, on the fast track for Cambridge grads, bored, not really doing much, dealing in the derivatives market, suits and bureaucracy all around me. I thought: 'What do I want out of life? If I've got a chance to do something I enjoy, then yeah, why don't I do it?' So I decided to try and make it as a pro-gamer. The Americans already have big money leagues, and gaming stars and organise these massive tournaments. Why couldn't the UK? Within weeks I'd teamed up with Hakeem, got a sponsorship deal, and was on The Big Breakfast with Johnny Vaughan taking the piss out of me. We signed two main sponsors: a peripherals manufacturer, Razer, which has this gaming mouse called the Boomslang, and a gaming website, gameplay.com, for a year. We do our own business deals and we managed to negotiate a six-figure sum. We've become like minor celebrities. We get a lot of attention at tournaments. We seem to have a lot of influence on the gaming community. People want to use anything we use - our mice, headphones, computers. We published the way we configure our PCs on our website and rolled in more than 300,000 hits on that alone. Normally, we get a few million visitors a month and we spend a lot of time answering questions and chatting online. Before we teamed up, we spent most of our time putting each other down. Hakeem just loves to complain. He bad-mouths everyone. There's a lot of rivalry on the scene: Brits hate Americans and Swedish. Americans hate Canadians and Euros. Living together is cool. We don't fight about domestics. He puts his Frosties in the sink a lot, but that's about it. But being in the house 24/7 drives me crazy. We need to get out of the flat, especially now we've bought this 100in video projector - we could be sitting at home watching DVDs all the time. So we got an office space which we've gutted and filled with technology and invite people round. It's better than sitting on your own and playing. But I like to go out and drink as much as possible. At the moment we are training for a tournament next weekend in Dallas. There's $100,000 in prizes. Six of us from our clan are going. Training for it is hard, because Hakeem flips when he loses. I'm comfortable with it. You win some, you lose some. A good Quake player needs co-ordination, speed, patience, confidence. But most of all, you have to stay calm. You're not going to have the reflexes of a 16-year-old, so psychology is a huge factor. You may not be able to out-draw your opponent, but you can out-think him. I definitely want to continue playing games. It's going to go more mainstream this year, especially with PlayStation 2 coming out. It'll be easy to get online and play multiplayer. Everyone will be doing it. Big companies are going to get involved. There's never been a better time to be in gaming but, secretly, I'm just pleased I don't have to get up in the morning. \u0095 Roy and Hakeem's website is at www.xsreality.com Coverage of this weekend's tournament can be found at razercpl.com",

      "body": "<p>Five years ago, the majority of people would have dismissed herbal medicine as being either quackery or having off-puttingly New Agey connotations and would not have considered trying it. However, the last year or so has seen the emergence of a growing movement of people who prefer to rely on one small flower's healing powers than on many more conventional medicines.</p> <p>Echinacea (commonly known as coneflower) is one of the world's most valued medicinal herbs. Although its name is derived from the Greek word for hedgehog, an association inspired by the flower's spiky central zone, echinacea - a native of central North America - was originally cultivated in the US. Today, however, you're likely to come across echinacea that's been grown in the rich, sandy soils of Europe, too. Its daisy-like flowers are gathered in full bloom from mid-summer to early autumn, and the roots of four-year-old plants are lifted in autumn.</p> <p>Of the nine echinacea species, Echinacea purpurea is the most commonly used in herbal medicine. That said, some medical herbalists believe that because some other species of echinacea, namely E augustifolia and E pallida, have different qualities, we should take whichever species provides the best solution to a specific ailment. Nevertheless, according to Dr Ann Walker, senior lecturer in human nutrition at Reading University, E purpurea is an excellent all-rounder.</p> <p>Echinacea's roots are deeply embedded in history: well before the 19th century, the Native American Comanche tribe used it as a remedy for toothache and sore throats, while the Sioux took it to counter rabies, snake bites and septic conditions. However, in Western countries, echinacea was - and still is - most widely called upon for its immune-system-boosting qualities. It is used today to treat infections of all kinds, and is particularly helpful in combating such chronic infections as post-viral fatigue syndrome or ME, and in preventing and treating colds, flu, skin disorders and respiratory infections. Children respond particularly well to it, and it can even help to clear up stubborn, recurrent ear infections and ease allergies, particularly asthma. Dr Walker believes that this flower has a 'crucial role to play in enhancing the body's natural immune response' - in other words, it helps your body to boost its natural ability to stave off, and counter, infections and other potentially harmful conditions.</p> <p>Echinacea has several key constituents: alkamides, caffeic-acid esters, polysaccharides, volatile oil, echinolone and betaine among them. Numerous studies indicate that echinacea affects our white blood cells - the body's natural defence soldiers - and that T lymphocytes (T cells), macrophages and the body's natural-killer cells are particularly sensitive to it. T cells are a type of blood cell that is responsible for 'cell-mediated immunity', that is, immune mechanisms that are not controlled, or mediated, by antibodies. This type of defence mechanism is extremely important in providing us with resistance to infection by moulds like yeast (such as Candida albicans) and fungi, as well as bacteria, parasites and viruses, including herpes simplex, which can cause cold sores, the Epstein-Barr virus and those that cause hepatitis. If you are suffering from an infection by any of these organisms, it's a good indication that your cell-mediated immunity is functioning below par. Cell-mediated immunity is also critical in protecting us against the development of cancer, such auto-immune diseases as rheumatoid arthritis and allergies, and many practitioners believe that echinacea can be used to treat all of these conditions by promoting the action of neutrophil, another type of white blood cell, which engulfs and destroys bacteria, tumour cells and dead particulate matter.</p> <p>The most common reason people take echinacea is to ward off colds and other bugs, in other words, as a prophylactic. I find that if I load up my body with echinacea as soon as I detect the first signs of a cold, the symptoms disappear virtually straightaway. Echinacea can also help you to recover from a cold or flu more quickly and easily. In addition, practitioners have traditionally used echinacea in the prevention and treatment of cancer because of its immunity-enhancing effects. According to the Journal of Medical Chemistry in 1992, a study carried out in a laboratory situation indicated that a constituent of Echinacea pallida has anti-cancer properties. Further studies are needed to clarify whether these results can be replicated, however, and therefore whether echinacea has an important role to play in cancer treatment and prevention. Another controversial area in which more research is needed is the use of echinacea in the treatment of Aids. Scientists have questioned whether echinacea's T-cell-stimulating action may simultaneously encourage the replication of HIV, in which case the use of this flower may be counterproductive.</p> <p>There has also been recent controversy over whether echinacea should be used in treating auto-immune conditions, such as eczema. Although some people believe it's inadvisable to take this remedy in such cases because it may enhance an abnormal immune response, which would make the condition worse, according to Dr Walker, 'This concern is ill founded - echinacea only enhances a normal immune response.' In fact, it acts as a very useful anti-allergenic agent. Another disagreement that continues to rage is whether you should stop taking echinacea after six weeks - some herbal practitioners believe that you will nullify its overall effectiveness if you take it continually. Yet many other herbalists, including Dr Walker, prescribe its use on a long-term basis, especially for people who have seriously compromised immune systems. If you are a healthy individual who has no apparent symptoms indicating a lowered immune system, you shouldn't need to take echinacea on a continual basis, just when you're either starting to feel under the weather. The current advice is that most people should take it for eight weeks, followed by a one-week break before resuming the course.</p> <p>The recommended dose is usually either in the region of a 500mg capsule or tablet or to 1 teaspoon of echinacea tincture dissolved in a small amount of water, both taken three times a day. If you have a sore throat or tonsillitis, some practitioners suggest you gargle with 50ml of echinacea decoction (liquid containing echinacea extract) three times a day. (Note that although echinacea doesn't appear to be toxic when it is used as recommended, according to Andrew Chevallier's The Encyclopaedia of Medicinal Herbs, Dorling Kindersley, \u00a325, high doses can cause nausea in some people.) So if you dread the usual spring onslaught of hay fever, colds and insect bites, why not enlist the aid of this floral ally?</p>",

He had been treating me for four months for the malaise that hung about me like a bad smell, and made me abstain from tea, coffee, alcohol.</p> <p>You know the scene. This was 1987, London. I was working in the fashion business; I felt chronically, but vaguely, unwell. My temper veered from irascible to unreasonable. This, as I hit my early thirties, was the way life was. I had a wife I loved and who loved me well, one adored child and another on the way, a business that seemed to be romping from success to success, a clothes rail filled with black and baggy designer clothes, a house we'd fixed up, a garden out the back that I was proud of - and yet I was angry with my own skin. Nothing suited.</p> <p>The healer said I was unhealable. There was only one course of action: to give up my work and spend a year working the land. Impossible. I had wife, child, baggy suits, a business. We never saw each other again.</p> <p>The garden had been there from the first. I have gardened since I was eight, albeit unwillingly for the first 10 years or so. But I grew to love it. I worked on farms for three years after I left school, and jobbing gardening saw me through college. I needed the soil like a fix, and as soon as we could, Sarah and I bought a house with as big a garden as possible - on the Islington/ Hackney border. The house had absorbed the next-door garden after that building had been bombed in the war. Nowadays, we couldn't afford to live there, but 20 years ago it was still a rough(ish) area and houses were, by today's standards, laughably cheap.</p> <p>We loved the garden. It is essential to understand the 'we'. From the first, Sarah and I gardened together. I do most of the heavy work, and I don't think she has ever touched any kind of grass-cutting implement, but there are no demarcation lines. Throughout our twenties, while our peers were gadding about the clubs of 80s London, we made our garden. We poured ourselves into it.</p> <p>But by 1987, the garden was made and I did not have enough landscape to lose myself in. I am not by nature a primper and preener. I do detail rather badly. I have never loved plants for plants' sake, so a garden that is a mere repository for plants could never satisfy. I was hungry to make a place. I have a visceral need to scrape a hollow in the ground. It has to do with the literal earth. The herbalist/acupuncturist knew me better than I knew myself - earth heals me better than any medicine or regime.</p> <p>So I jumped ship. I gave up all allegiance to the business and London. Small businesses are like marriage - you cannot just walk out on them without tearing the whole thing apart, but I believed I could just slip away without anyone noticing. We bought a large house with 35 acres in Herefordshire at the peak of the late-80s property boom, when you could exchange a three-bedroom Hackney house for an 11-bedroom farmhouse with swimming pool, ballroom (really) and nine stables. The only hitch seemed to be that we had not actually sold the Hackney place when we bought the new place, and property prices spiralled down from exactly the day after we moved. We sold it a year later, having paid \u00a3100 a day in interest. At that time, my total pay was less than that. I have written about our two-and-half years at Hanburies - our Herefordshire house - in The Prickotty Bush. It is a sorry story.</p> <p>While the business fell apart, I tried to make a 12-acre garden. We went with a child of two and a baby of six months. By the time we left, there was another babe in arms. I loved it there. It was home in the way that nothing before or since was or could be again.</p> <p>When we got there, the garden had been used to graze up to 30 horses at a time. The whole place was effectively vandalised. But it was indescribably beautiful, set on its own on a hillside overlooking the Frome valley. It had a two-acre wood with a ditch that became a stream running into a clogged-up medieval fishpond. I cleared the throat-high weeds and discovered a Victorian fernery. I dug the old kitchen garden. I made three terraces where there had been a steep slope by moving hundreds of tons of rock and soil from one side of the house to the other. There was a five-acre orchard, where owls hid during the day. I made a herb garden, a cutting garden, perennial borders, a large lawn, planted trees and hedges, hardly slept, was outside all day in all weather, writing at night with clumsy fingers, not daring to open letters or answer the phone because all roads led to bankruptcy and defeat. I was completely and utterly satisfied. I gave the place more than I had, used up reserves that will never be replenished. It was all utter folly.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Sarah - who was seriously ill for nearly a year of that time - looked after the children and tried to run the business, continue designing jewellery collections and salvage something from the disastrous economic position. Ironically, at this time I started to appear on TV. A researcher had seen one of the monthly pieces I was writing for You magazine and got me on one of the rare occasions when I ran in to answer the phone. Would I do a screen test? So from October 1989, I did a weekly live piece and made dozens of films for Granada's This Morning. I never considered it more than a curious turn-up for the books, but the money was vital.</p> <p>Of course, the shit hit the fan. The overdraft soared, interest rates doubled, the banks wanted their money and bounced every cheque. It is a familiar story, and it could have been worse. The business was voluntarily liquidated, the shop sold for a 10th of what it had cost, and television and journalistic work, caught in the depression, dried to a trickle. At least we found a buyer for the house before the bank repossessed it.</p> <p>Sarah, having lost her job and business, drove down the drive on 15 February 1991, her birthday, with three little children asking why Daddy was crying. Again. I don't want to overegg the pudding. We survived. But for the record, the worst thing about losing your job and your home is not the loss of creature comforts but the humiliation. The embarrassment. You feel such a complete and utter fool.</p> <p>Things got worse. There was no work, so I was on the dole in 1992. My mother died and left me enough money for a deposit on a house, and we found our current house. It was obviously lovely, but without water, electricity, sanitation or any interior walls and, as it turned out, a roof that was about to slide off. It was declared unfit for human habitation, and we rented a rat-infested farmhouse nearby. These were the bad times.</p> <p>Things came to a head in spring 1992, when a newspaper ran a picture of a wartime Serbian about to have his head sawn off by a gang of laughing Croatians. This disturbed me beyond all measure. Couldn't close my eyes. Couldn't sleep in case I dreamt. I was doing a rare day's work with a film crew when I saw a cow charge into the dining room in slow motion. No one else noticed. I drove the children to school and saw a council worker cutting down the cow parsley, and I remember slumping over the wheel, sobbing like a baby. My body began to collect infections in a casual, almost perfunctory way. I was 37 and I was over.</p> <p>Sarah, of course, came to the rescue. She told me that she could not cope with me any longer. If I saw a doctor, she would stand by me. If I refused, she would go. Pills eased me. I will never forget the bliss of standing at the kitchen sink in that horrid farmhouse and realising that I did not mind. Washing this cup, drying that plate was enough. It was - and I am completely serious - heaven. I spent months carving large wooden bowls. In a strange way, I was content.</p> <p>After an 18-month gap, I began to garden again. Our new house had two acres of scrubby, abandoned field. While the year-long repairwork to the house went on, I cleared it, wove a fence round the outside, designed the layout and starting digging. Earth mended the hurt.</p> <p>We moved in at the end of 1992. The house was still a building site because we couldn't afford to pay the builders and had no possessions left to sell. We were completely, stony broke. Then the phone went as I carried a box through the door, offering me work the following day. I have not stopped working since. I wrote freelance pieces for just about every paper and got this job on The Observer in January 1994. It was - and remains - the summit of my journalistic ambition. Slowly, we paid off debts and were able to buy furniture, although by most people's standards, an astonishingly high percentage of my income went to the garden. It still does. Sarah and I gardened just as we did in London and through it reached heights of soaring happiness. After seven years, we have a garden that is absolutely lovely. It is this beautiful thing that we are making out of life's muddle. It is, to use Samuel Beckett's phrase, our stain upon the silence.</p> <p>One of the ironies of success is that I spend less and less time in my own garden. Television takes me away from home far too much, and when I am here I spend a lot of time writing (a grand dame of British gardening said to me recently that 'the great thing about articles is that one can knock them off in about three hours' - ha! My pieces take hours and hours to write), but the first thing I do when I get home is to go round the garden, by torchlight if need be, reacquainting myself. For the last year, we have had Gareth, who came to us from Pershore Horticultural College, doing many of the things I would love to do if I had the time.</p> <p>But may all my problems be of this order. To maintain my sanity, I need at least one full day a week in the garden, and do what I can to organise it, even if I spend that day just hand weeding or digging. It works better than any pill, better than any medicine. Earth heals.</p>",

I made a herb garden, a cutting garden, perennial borders, a large lawn, planted trees and hedges, hardly slept, was outside all day in all weather, writing at night with clumsy fingers, not daring to open letters or answer the phone because all roads led to bankruptcy and defeat. I was completely and utterly satisfied. I gave the place more than I had, used up reserves that will never be replenished. It was all utter folly. Meanwhile, Sarah - who was seriously ill for nearly a year of that time - looked after the children and tried to run the business, continue designing jewellery collections and salvage something from the disastrous economic position. Ironically, at this time I started to appear on TV. A researcher had seen one of the monthly pieces I was writing for You magazine and got me on one of the rare occasions when I ran in to answer the phone. Would I do a screen test? So from October 1989, I did a weekly live piece and made dozens of films for Granada's This Morning. I never considered it more than a curious turn-up for the books, but the money was vital. Of course, the shit hit the fan. The overdraft soared, interest rates doubled, the banks wanted their money and bounced every cheque. It is a familiar story, and it could have been worse. The business was voluntarily liquidated, the shop sold for a 10th of what it had cost, and television and journalistic work, caught in the depression, dried to a trickle. At least we found a buyer for the house before the bank repossessed it. Sarah, having lost her job and business, drove down the drive on 15 February 1991, her birthday, with three little children asking why Daddy was crying. Again. I don't want to overegg the pudding. We survived. But for the record, the worst thing about losing your job and your home is not the loss of creature comforts but the humiliation. The embarrassment. You feel such a complete and utter fool. Things got worse. There was no work, so I was on the dole in 1992. My mother died and left me enough money for a deposit on a house, and we found our current house. It was obviously lovely, but without water, electricity, sanitation or any interior walls and, as it turned out, a roof that was about to slide off. It was declared unfit for human habitation, and we rented a rat-infested farmhouse nearby. These were the bad times. Things came to a head in spring 1992, when a newspaper ran a picture of a wartime Serbian about to have his head sawn off by a gang of laughing Croatians. This disturbed me beyond all measure. Couldn't close my eyes. Couldn't sleep in case I dreamt. I was doing a rare day's work with a film crew when I saw a cow charge into the dining room in slow motion. No one else noticed. I drove the children to school and saw a council worker cutting down the cow parsley, and I remember slumping over the wheel, sobbing like a baby. My body began to collect infections in a casual, almost perfunctory way. I was 37 and I was over. Sarah, of course, came to the rescue. She told me that she could not cope with me any longer. If I saw a doctor, she would stand by me. If I refused, she would go. Pills eased me. I will never forget the bliss of standing at the kitchen sink in that horrid farmhouse and realising that I did not mind. Washing this cup, drying that plate was enough. It was - and I am completely serious - heaven. I spent months carving large wooden bowls. In a strange way, I was content. After an 18-month gap, I began to garden again. Our new house had two acres of scrubby, abandoned field. While the year-long repairwork to the house went on, I cleared it, wove a fence round the outside, designed the layout and starting digging. Earth mended the hurt. We moved in at the end of 1992. The house was still a building site because we couldn't afford to pay the builders and had no possessions left to sell. We were completely, stony broke. Then the phone went as I carried a box through the door, offering me work the following day. I have not stopped working since. I wrote freelance pieces for just about every paper and got this job on The Observer in January 1994. It was - and remains - the summit of my journalistic ambition. Slowly, we paid off debts and were able to buy furniture, although by most people's standards, an astonishingly high percentage of my income went to the garden. It still does. Sarah and I gardened just as we did in London and through it reached heights of soaring happiness. After seven years, we have a garden that is absolutely lovely. It is this beautiful thing that we are making out of life's muddle. It is, to use Samuel Beckett's phrase, our stain upon the silence. One of the ironies of success is that I spend less and less time in my own garden. Television takes me away from home far too much, and when I am here I spend a lot of time writing (a grand dame of British gardening said to me recently that 'the great thing about articles is that one can knock them off in about three hours' - ha! My pieces take hours and hours to write), but the first thing I do when I get home is to go round the garden, by torchlight if need be, reacquainting myself. For the last year, we have had Gareth, who came to us from Pershore Horticultural College, doing many of the things I would love to do if I had the time. But may all my problems be of this order. To maintain my sanity, I need at least one full day a week in the garden, and do what I can to organise it, even if I spend that day just hand weeding or digging. It works better than any pill, better than any medicine. Earth heals.",

'But increasingly there are old agricultural pieces being used for gardens, and because we're in Yorkshire we get a lot of stone stuff, from troughs that are turned into flowerbeds to carved boar's heads from stately homes.' Rain hoppers, urns and fountains are also popular, and there was even an entire clock tower from a biscuit factory sold at Andy Thornton's recently, a snip at \u00a315,000. </p> <p>Rural areas provide plenty of salvage for people who don't want to pay upwards of \u00a3500 for a pig's trough flowerbed: sturdy Victorian bathtubs and old industrial radiators used to line garden walls, can be found at salvage sites for under \u00a3100, and there's always the grass-roots method for the true devotee: scouring farms and scrapyards for a real gem - although it's more than likely that the salvage companies will have got there first. </p> <p>One of the appeals of architectural salvage is the quality of much of the material that finds its way to salvage yards, however humble its origins might have been. Martin Skegg has decorated his garden with three London litter bins from the 60s, which he found at a west London salvage yard about five years ago and paid \u00a3500 for. 'There's real craftsmanship in the way the City of London coat of arms has been carved then painted into the stone, so I consider them a bargain,' he explains. Kate Woods and Ivan Spate created an Art Deco look for the London cruise boat The Silver Sturgeon, using materials gleaned from French chateaux, an Art Deco building in London Bridge, and even the original, pre-bomb Lloyds building. 'The boat's pillars all have iron railings, which were once round the trees of a French deer garden,' says Kate. 'They were there to stop the deer from eating the bark.' </p> <p>So how does all this stuff end up in people's homes and gardens? 'They're always nibbling away at the edges of grand buildings, aren't they,' says Adrian Amos of Lassco, the London architectural salvage centre. </p> <p>'A new toilet gets put in, and an old gate gets thrown out. We've had sections of the Palace of Westminster in recently, headstones from a Quaker cemetery in Bethnal Green, and some material from buildings designed by the great 19th-century architect Augustus Pujin. We even had a tea urn from Buckingham Palace turn up - it makes a terrible cup of tea, but it's a good conversation piece. Sometimes, people want to restore a house to its original glory, and we can help. </p> <p>'A few years ago, a millionaire arms dealer bought a stately home that was demolished in 1936, and he wanted to rebuild it as it was. We happened to have the original chimney piece, so we sold it to him. Now he's just got the rest of the house to find.' </p> <p>Andy Thornton recently came upon some highly valuable oak panelling from the former Berkshire home of John Lennon, which was bought in the early 1990s by an Arabian millionaire who promptly ripped out all kinds of original fixtures, thereby making a handful of architectural salvage dealers very happy indeed. </p> <p>Churches are a goldmine for architectural salvage. 'English churches are in a period of change at the moment, and as the spaces are being utilised for other functions, the old pews and altars are being ripped out,' explains Andy Thornton's Lindsay Hepworth. 'A lot of money was put into the late-Victorian Methodist churches, so good quality timber and the best craftsmen were used.' The beauty of the item can be brought out by turning it into something else, which means Gothic oak pulpits (around \u00a33,500) and pitch-pine organs with pipes (up to \u00a320,000) for the very rich, and the odd pew turned into a garden bench for the rest of us. </p> <p>Architectural salvage is an expensive business, explaining why it is people like Kevin Keegan (Victorian street lamps) and Take That's Mark Owen (wrought iron railings) who are among Andy Thornton's best customers, but a less expensive reclaimed item can transform a garden when used in the right way. Pillar and wall-mounted post boxes go for around \u00a3600 and are very popular, while statuary such as York stone carved heads and white marble four seasons figures can go from a couple of hundred into five figures. </p> <p>'No matter how small their plot, people often like to think of it as their own little bit of ancient Rome,' says Lassco's Adrian Amos of the appeal of statuary, 'and, at the moment, we can't get enough of the stuff, or cast-iron benches, which tend to go for around \u00a31,500. But you must leave a little bit of potential for the end result.

Yes, everywhere - gnomes on the balconies, gnomes on the balustrades, gnomes on the parterre, gnomes on the lawns.</p> <p>'It is not a question of spoiling a historic site with kitsch, rather of initiating a dialogue between this type of sculpture and its site,' says Laurent Le Bon, organiser of the exhibition. 'It is the context which transforms a gnome into a garden gnome.' To prove his point, he has invited some very superior gnomes to his show, antique gnomes who would utterly deny kinship with the plastic red-capped species. Take, Morgante, for example, a 1565 Medici court dwarf in marble, which hails from the Boboli gardens in Florence.</p> <p>Few people would have a problem with these gnomes - in fact, in Britain we would hardly call them gnomes at all. But purely as a matter of semantics we are wrong. The 'quaint manikins' which we disparagingly call gnomes were first sold in Germany as gnomenfiguren, which simply meant 'miniature figures'. The first person to import gnomes into England was Sir Charles Isham, who created a rock garden at Lamport Hall, peopled with porcelain figures he bought from Germany, where in the 1890s they were sold as table ornaments.</p> <p>Gnomes in their thousands are still imported from Germany. There is a Gnome Reserve in Devon (with 1,000 small residents), which attracts 25,000 visitors a year, and an International Gnome Club based in California with its own internet site. Thus the popularity of the genus cannot be denied - but neither can the scorn with which it is viewed by so-called people of good taste. For years, gnomes have been banned from the Chelsea Flower Show - it is claimed that their bright colouring renders them vulgar. But could there be a more arcane reason? After all, Sir Charles Isham was a spiritualist and believed in fairies. So could these grinning figures evoke in us a subliminal fear of the supernatural?</p> <p>\u0095 The exhibition runs until 31 July at Domaine de Bagatelle, Bois de Boulogne, in Paris (00 33 1 4510 2010)</p>",

Yes, everywhere - gnomes on the balconies, gnomes on the balustrades, gnomes on the parterre, gnomes on the lawns. 'It is not a question of spoiling a historic site with kitsch, rather of initiating a dialogue between this type of sculpture and its site,' says Laurent Le Bon, organiser of the exhibition. 'It is the context which transforms a gnome into a garden gnome.' To prove his point, he has invited some very superior gnomes to his show, antique gnomes who would utterly deny kinship with the plastic red-capped species. Take, Morgante, for example, a 1565 Medici court dwarf in marble, which hails from the Boboli gardens in Florence. Few people would have a problem with these gnomes - in fact, in Britain we would hardly call them gnomes at all. But purely as a matter of semantics we are wrong. The 'quaint manikins' which we disparagingly call gnomes were first sold in Germany as gnomenfiguren, which simply meant 'miniature figures'. The first person to import gnomes into England was Sir Charles Isham, who created a rock garden at Lamport Hall, peopled with porcelain figures he bought from Germany, where in the 1890s they were sold as table ornaments. Gnomes in their thousands are still imported from Germany. There is a Gnome Reserve in Devon (with 1,000 small residents), which attracts 25,000 visitors a year, and an International Gnome Club based in California with its own internet site. Thus the popularity of the genus cannot be denied - but neither can the scorn with which it is viewed by so-called people of good taste. For years, gnomes have been banned from the Chelsea Flower Show - it is claimed that their bright colouring renders them vulgar. But could there be a more arcane reason? After all, Sir Charles Isham was a spiritualist and believed in fairies. So could these grinning figures evoke in us a subliminal fear of the supernatural? \u0095 The exhibition runs until 31 July at Domaine de Bagatelle, Bois de Boulogne, in Paris (00 33 1 4510 2010)",

'There is a definite treatment deficit for men,' says Dr Judy Proudfoot of the Institute of Psychiatrists, about a healthcare system in which one in four women receive treatment for depression, compared to one in 10 men.

'Before the breakdown, my hero was Kirk Douglas,' he says, trying to explain the impossible expectations he had of himself. 'Now, it's Woody Allen.'

      "body": "<p>We may live in a hi-tech world - with email, the internet and e-commerce speed-weaving themselves into our everyday lives - but while the 21st century goes .com crazy, there's comfort to be had from the fact that a growing number of people are taking time out from this virtual reality by upping spades and heading down to their local allotment.</p> <p>In England alone, 30,000 people are waiting for a vacant site, while in some areas of Scotland, wannabe allotment holders can wait up to five years before getting a plot. The trend is towards organic farming, and the average age is said to be taking a nose dive - in Craiggentinny-Telferton, near Edinburgh, 60 per cent of allotment holders are thirty-something women, according to the Food Trust of Scotland.</p> <p>Allotment life conjures up images of rural escape, happy, healthy outdoor communities, packed lunches, Thermos flasks and gas stoves to boil up that well-earned cuppa. But it takes more than a cursory dig and a scattering of seeds to get results. Allotties have to work hard to maintain their plots: if they've got any hope of wheeling home trolleyloads of cheap, GM-free fruit and veg, they have to put in the hours - digging, planting and harvesting crops, while contending with the weather, birds, mice and slugs.</p> <p>But the public, it seems, is increasingly eager to grab its secateurs and get to work. Geof Stokes, society secretary of the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners, puts this down to the changing attitudes of the younger generations. 'A lot of young people are concerned about GM and food issues, which is filtering through into people taking allotments,' he says. 'The young are thinking in terms of the future and are asking what are we are doing to the environment.' Allotment gardening, Stokes argues, is the only activity that is sustainable.</p> <p>Take on an allotment and the council becomes your landlord. You may be king of your 250 square metres of turf, but there are rules and regulations to abide by: sheds and greenhouses can only be so large and painted in certain colours; bonfires can only be lit at certain times; produce cannot be sold and plots must be seen to be cultivated, otherwise they'll be taken back.</p> <p>At the end of the 1800s, land was put aside for the poor to feed themselves and escape the horrors of the poorhouse. Then, between the wars, everyone was urged to pick up a fork and get digging, to help overcome food shortages. The public rallied and plots hit a peak of 1.5 million during the Second World War, producing an estimated 3 million tonnes of fruit and veg a year.</p> <p>Today, there are roughly a third of a million plots in Great Britain. After the war, allotments were abandoned in their thousands - knocked on the head by postwar prosperity and a growing leisure industry.

'We've got a good mix of people. We've got Italian, Portuguese, Algerian, Japanese - and it's interesting to watch the different people and the different ways they garden.' Eric was stationed in Malaya for 11 years during the war. He's been to Vietnam, Honk Kong and the Philippines, but says, 'Mrs Yamamoto grows vegetables I've never seen before.'</p> <p>Demands for allotments is definitely picking up, according to Eric.

It's your plot, and you can do what you want with it.'</p> <p><b> Puran Sanichara</b></p> <p>Twenty years ago, Puran Sanichara, an environmental health inspector, decided to take on an allotment so he could grow organic food for his family. 'A good allottie,' he says, 'is a good conservationist.' Being a health officer, he says he was aware of what the farmers used in the way of pesticides and fertilisers. 'When my two children were at home, I had three allotments, and we would take home barrels of onions and other vegetables, and we would eat it all. Children like to know they have been part of the production, and it teaches them that natural things don't come sanitised. We were really self-sufficient, and grew Oriental, Mediterranean and all the standard British vegetables.'</p> <p>Today, Puran, 51, has two of the most immaculate allotments at the site, with the neatest rows of carrots, potatoes, onions, spinach and winter spinach, as well as the more unusual Chinese mustard, bayam, pad chow, Japanese cucumber and a range of medium-to-hot chillies. He swears by a little sprinkling of seaweed extract here and there to 'sweeten the crop', and has an impressive irrigation system that he picked up from his childhood in Guyana.</p> <p>'In South America, there are two rainy and two dry seasons, so you need to irrigate crops,' he explains. 'I've raised beds here, as I'm on a gentle slope, which is almost like growing on terraces.'</p> <p>Although Puran comes from a farming family, he says he 'hated' having to help out as a child, but since then, he's done a complete U-turn. 'The only pastime I enjoy here is gardening,' he says.</p> <p>Puran remembers the knock-on effect of London Underground's nearby development on the wildlife. 'There were loads of foxes, and I used to watch them wandering around looking disorientated, as they had been shunted out of their habitat. They dug a lair under the old trading hut, and I couldn't raise seeds on one of my plots, as the cubs used to use it as a playing field.' He decided to give the mothers a helping hand feeding the cubs, and stocked up on dog food and tins of sardines. 'I've still got a tin of dog food in here somewhere,' he says, rummaging around in his greenhouse.</p> <p>Everyone is very friendly down on the allotments, but you definitely get the feeling that, in the nicest possible way, nobody wants to be outdone. Puran agrees: 'There's a great deal of competition between allotment gardeners. We gently pinch each others ideas and then develop them,' he says with a smile.</p> <p><b> Nora Doerfel</b></p> <p>Nora Doerfel is digging her plot and pulling out the 'invidious' bindweed roots, which have to be completely removed for them not to return. It is hard, physical work, but she's in her element. 'This is a lovely balance to my indoor life. I'm not a sporty person, but if you work here for two or three hours you don't need to go to an expensive gym.'</p> <p>It's 27 years since Nora first took over her plot, and the fruit trees she planted then are now well established. Soft fruits are her passion. 'I've got white, black, red currants. I've got them all,' she says. And her Victoria plum tree has had up to hundredweight of fruit. 'Then the whole neighbourhood gets stuff from me, and I'm known as that old lady with the fruit and vegetables.'</p> <p>When she first arrived, Nora, who teaches dressmaking, remembers the secretary was a Welshman called Mr Matthews.

'You have to protect everything,' she stresses, 'otherwise the mice will eat the seed, the birds the shoots, and the slugs the beans.' Crows and magpies are particularly unwelcome, but robins are another matter. 'The robins usually come while I'm digging.

She leads a busy life, as she still teaches part time, but would never give up her allotment. 'Sometimes I ask why am I doing this,' she says. 'But I'm potty about gardening.

In England alone, 30,000 people are waiting for a vacant site, while in some areas of Scotland, wannabe allotment holders can wait up to five years before getting a plot. The trend is towards organic farming, and the average age is said to be taking a nose dive - in Craiggentinny-Telferton, near Edinburgh, 60 per cent of allotment holders are thirty-something women, according to the Food Trust of Scotland. Allotment life conjures up images of rural escape, happy, healthy outdoor communities, packed lunches, Thermos flasks and gas stoves to boil up that well-earned cuppa. But it takes more than a cursory dig and a scattering of seeds to get results. Allotties have to work hard to maintain their plots: if they've got any hope of wheeling home trolleyloads of cheap, GM-free fruit and veg, they have to put in the hours - digging, planting and harvesting crops, while contending with the weather, birds, mice and slugs. But the public, it seems, is increasingly eager to grab its secateurs and get to work. Geof Stokes, society secretary of the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners, puts this down to the changing attitudes of the younger generations. 'A lot of young people are concerned about GM and food issues, which is filtering through into people taking allotments,' he says. 'The young are thinking in terms of the future and are asking what are we are doing to the environment.' Allotment gardening, Stokes argues, is the only activity that is sustainable. Take on an allotment and the council becomes your landlord. You may be king of your 250 square metres of turf, but there are rules and regulations to abide by: sheds and greenhouses can only be so large and painted in certain colours; bonfires can only be lit at certain times; produce cannot be sold and plots must be seen to be cultivated, otherwise they'll be taken back. At the end of the 1800s, land was put aside for the poor to feed themselves and escape the horrors of the poorhouse. Then, between the wars, everyone was urged to pick up a fork and get digging, to help overcome food shortages. The public rallied and plots hit a peak of 1.5 million during the Second World War, producing an estimated 3 million tonnes of fruit and veg a year. Today, there are roughly a third of a million plots in Great Britain. After the war, allotments were abandoned in their thousands - knocked on the head by postwar prosperity and a growing leisure industry. The first time that allotments actually became fashionable was in the 70s, when couples rushed to pull on their wellies and become the next Tom and Barbara from The Good Life. But when the mud-caked realities of opting out kicked in, allotments suddenly lost their appeal. Now, the trend seems to be taking hold again as the public is choosing not so much to escape the rat race as to escape the produce on supermarket shelves. In Russia, the dire economic situation is forcing many to turn to allotments to survive. But while some grow vegetables, others choose simply to steal them, forcing allotment owners to set up watch over their plots and to defend them, sometimes with violent results. In England, there may not be the desperate food shortage that exists in Russia, but life on an allotment is not always as relaxed and harmonious as you might imagine. Neighbours do not always see eye to eye, and the absence of fences between plots means that it's hard to cut yourself off from the Joneses if they start to infringe on your cabbage patch. Last September in Leicestershire, Sandor Bata, a 73-year-old allotment holder, was jailed for life after killing his neighbour following an argument over clematis cuttings. Bata and 62-year-old Michael Willson had been having a long-running battle that began over snails and escalated to the dumping of garden waste. On the morning of the final argument, Bata came across cuttings from Willson's allotment dumped on his plot, and clearly decided this was the last straw. He threw the cuttings over the wall into Willson's garden, which backed on to the two allotments, then retreated to his shed, re-emerging with a loaded a 9mm semi-automatic pistol, which he aimed and fired at Willson. He claimed that he only intended to wound his enemy, but the shot proved fatal. Bata then hopped on a bus into Leicester to have a pint, before phoning the police to give himself up. When he later flagged down a patrol car, he was still carrying the gun in a bag, together with the packed lunch he'd had prepared for a nice, quiet day down on the allotment.

It hit a peak of 540p, and is still comfortably ahead at 502p. </p> <p>The truth is if Diageo didn't exist, you wouldn't invent it. If you had a world-leading spirits business which makes excellent money from selling high-priced drinks to the millions of people who are impressed by brands, then would you choose to marry it with a company doling out Burger King Whoppers? What connects pints of Guinness with tins of sweetcorn? (Answer: very little.) </p> <p>As we noted elsewhere last week, an eventual break-up of the group feels inevitable. American investors, in particular, are keen that the food operations and Burger King should leave the Diageo stable. There are two practical problems.

      "bodyText": "Suggestions that Diageo is ripe for a corporate shake-up have given the company's share price a magnificent lift over the past few days. Last weekend, the price was just 471p. It hit a peak of 540p, and is still comfortably ahead at 502p. The truth is if Diageo didn't exist, you wouldn't invent it. If you had a world-leading spirits business which makes excellent money from selling high-priced drinks to the millions of people who are impressed by brands, then would you choose to marry it with a company doling out Burger King Whoppers? What connects pints of Guinness with tins of sweetcorn? (Answer: very little.) As we noted elsewhere last week, an eventual break-up of the group feels inevitable. American investors, in particular, are keen that the food operations and Burger King should leave the Diageo stable. There are two practical problems. Selling Burger King would, as things stand, present Diageo with an unwelcome bill for capital gains tax. And second, Paul Walsh, who is about to start working himself into the job of Diageo chief executive, comes from Pillsbury - the food side of Diageo.

The nine members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) are supposed to be in purdah from the Friday before their interest rate decision. Last Tuesday the Bank Governor broke cover and entered what he described as the 'lion's den' of the British Chamber of Commerce national conference. Eddie George made a point of saying that it was 'just a day before our monthly policy-making meeting. In fact, strictly speaking, according to our MPC \"purdah rules\" I ought not to be here at all.' The BCC conference had been preceded by panic in the ranks about the level of the pound and the damage this was doing to British industry. The Governor has had one or two difficult 'run-ins' with industrialists on this subject. But on this occasion the Bank was cock-a-hoop.

Fortunately, there is something it can do. </p> <p>The pound is high against the euro for two reasons. First, our short-term interest rates are a lot higher than those on the Continent, so firms find it cheaper to borrow in euros and swap into pounds if necessary. Others with cash will park it in sterling for a higher return. Both effects drive up the pound. </p> <p>Second, the dollar is also high against the euro, and the pound tends to act in a 'mid-Atlantic' way - splitting the difference between the dollar and the euro. </p> <p>The Government cannot do anything about the dollar, and it cannot do much about short-term interest rates. But there is an oddity in the situation that gives it an opportunity. While our short-term interest rates - those on bank deposits or short-term loans - are higher than in Europe, our long-term rates, those on bonds issued for ten or 20 years, are lower. The Government can borrow by issuing bonds with 20 or more years to maturity for just over 4.5 per cent. Similar bonds issued by the French, German or Italian governments, and denominated in euros, yield 5.5 per cent. So the UK can issue bonds for sterling, sell the sterling for euros and invest the proceeds in European bonds. This means it would actually generate revenue of roughly \u00a310 million for every \u00a31 billion it raises. </p> <p>But, more to the point, it is selling a lot of pounds and buying a lot of euros, cancelling out the actions of companies doing the opposite at the short end of the interest rate spectrum. If it does that on a big enough scale it will push the pound down, though the scale required could be tens of billions of pounds. </p> <p>Those numbers are enough to frighten off some politicians, it seems. But they should not be. The Government would be borrowing, yes, but its net debt would not increase. The money is not spent but invested in first-class assets. Moreover the extra bonds issued would be swallowed eagerly by a UK capital market starved of such paper. </p> <p>Companies providing life insurance and pensions are required to hold government bonds. They would take a lot more. If bond yields went up a touch owing to extra supply, that would simply improve the lot of pensioners buying annuities.

Parking my money in sterling because I make 3 per cent more than in euros seems like a good wheeze unless I have reason to think the pound might fall by a lot more than 3 per cent. If I think that, obviously I won't go near sterling. If I know that the British Government is game to sell billions and billions of pounds for euros - and is being paid money by the market to do so - won't I reckon there is a chance the pound will fall? So will I buy pounds for that 3 per cent, which now looks rather measly in relation to the risks? Maybe not. </p> <p>Some people argue that if confidence in the pound's current level is undermined in that way it might fall too far and cause domestic inflation. That is a pathetic argument.

      "body": "<p>The world's endangered whales face the biggest threat to their future since the moratorium on whaling was imposed more than a decade ago. Environmental groups are warning that industrial-scale commercial whaling is set to be reintroduced by the back door at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) being attended by 150 nations in Nairobi this week.</p> <p>The warning comes amid international concern that whaling nations have been buying the support of developing nations with aid packages, and trading votes with African countries which want to restart international trade in ivory.</p> <p>Trade in the meat of any of the great whales is illegal, but Norway and Japan have put down resolutions at this week's meeting to allow trade in the meat of minke whales and grey whales. The CITES meeting - the first for three years - is billed as one of the most important for endangered animals for decades. South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana want to use the convention to restart international trade in ivory. Cuba is making a bid to restart trade in hawksbill turtles.</p> <p>Commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling Commission in 1986, but whaling has continued for 'scientific purposes'. Last week the Japanese whaling fleet returned from Antarctic waters with a catch of 439 minke whales, up from 389 last year.</p> <p>This meat can be sold only on local markets. But Japan and Norway now want to open up the lucrative international trade in whale products. Whale sushi is one of the most expensive delicacies in Japanese restaurants, with the meat selling wholesale for several hundred dollars a kilo. Norwegians eat whale steak, and also make whale sausages. However, they do not eat the blubber, but have been storing it in vast warehouses until they can legally export it to Japan.</p> <p>Japan and Norway put down a similar resolution at the last convention three years ago, and fell only nine votes short of victory. Since then they have both invested many millions of pounds in intensive lobbying of poorer nations to win their support.</p> <p>Chris Stroud, chief executive of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, said: 'This is the most crucial decision since the moratorium on whaling was put in place. It would pre-empt a very rapid return to industrial-scale whaling. The vote is really close - it could go either way'.</p> <p>Greenpeace's whale campaigner, Richard Page, said: 'This is the most important political meeting for whales for many, many years. It's absolutely crucial.'</p> <p>Norway and Japan argue that there is no scientific reason to continue the ban on minke and the grey whales, since their populations have returned to healthy levels. There are now thought to be about 900,000 minke whales, roughly the same level as before whaling began, and the total grey whale population is steady at around 20,000 - although the population of Asian grey whales has dwindled to around 100.</p> <p>However, conservationists argue that restarting the legal trade in whale products gives a huge incentive to increase the scale of 'scientific whaling' and will encourage illegal poaching.</p> <p>During the ban there have been repeated incidents of illegal smuggling of whale meat. In 1996 six tonnes of minke whale was discovered being exported to Japan disguised as prawns. Two years ago whale sausages were on open sale at Oslo airport, until the Norwegian government was pressured into clamping down on it.</p> <p>DNA tests on meat in Tokyo markets have shown that some of it comes from severely endangered species, such as the Mexican humpback. Many species of the great whales are still on the verge of extinction. The population of blue whales in the Southern hemisphere has fallen from 220,000 to just 460, while the population of the right whale has dropped from about 100,000 to 7,000.</p> <p>Conservationists argue that poachers of endangered species could use the legal international trade as cover. 'If there is legal trade, it makes illegal trade so much easier,' said Page. After the ban on trade in ivory was temporarily lifted three years ago there was a jump in the amount of illegal poaching.</p> <p>There is also concern that an international trade in whale meat will undermine the International Whaling Commission's ban on commercial whaling. Stroud said: 'Norway and Japan are trying to restart commercial whaling through the back-door.'</p> <p>The Japanese and Norwegian resolutions will be opposed by most developed nations, including the UK.

      "bodyText": "The world's endangered whales face the biggest threat to their future since the moratorium on whaling was imposed more than a decade ago. Environmental groups are warning that industrial-scale commercial whaling is set to be reintroduced by the back door at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) being attended by 150 nations in Nairobi this week. The warning comes amid international concern that whaling nations have been buying the support of developing nations with aid packages, and trading votes with African countries which want to restart international trade in ivory. Trade in the meat of any of the great whales is illegal, but Norway and Japan have put down resolutions at this week's meeting to allow trade in the meat of minke whales and grey whales. The CITES meeting - the first for three years - is billed as one of the most important for endangered animals for decades. South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana want to use the convention to restart international trade in ivory. Cuba is making a bid to restart trade in hawksbill turtles. Commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling Commission in 1986, but whaling has continued for 'scientific purposes'. Last week the Japanese whaling fleet returned from Antarctic waters with a catch of 439 minke whales, up from 389 last year. This meat can be sold only on local markets. But Japan and Norway now want to open up the lucrative international trade in whale products. Whale sushi is one of the most expensive delicacies in Japanese restaurants, with the meat selling wholesale for several hundred dollars a kilo. Norwegians eat whale steak, and also make whale sausages. However, they do not eat the blubber, but have been storing it in vast warehouses until they can legally export it to Japan. Japan and Norway put down a similar resolution at the last convention three years ago, and fell only nine votes short of victory. Since then they have both invested many millions of pounds in intensive lobbying of poorer nations to win their support. Chris Stroud, chief executive of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, said: 'This is the most crucial decision since the moratorium on whaling was put in place. It would pre-empt a very rapid return to industrial-scale whaling. The vote is really close - it could go either way'. Greenpeace's whale campaigner, Richard Page, said: 'This is the most important political meeting for whales for many, many years. It's absolutely crucial.' Norway and Japan argue that there is no scientific reason to continue the ban on minke and the grey whales, since their populations have returned to healthy levels. There are now thought to be about 900,000 minke whales, roughly the same level as before whaling began, and the total grey whale population is steady at around 20,000 - although the population of Asian grey whales has dwindled to around 100. However, conservationists argue that restarting the legal trade in whale products gives a huge incentive to increase the scale of 'scientific whaling' and will encourage illegal poaching. During the ban there have been repeated incidents of illegal smuggling of whale meat. In 1996 six tonnes of minke whale was discovered being exported to Japan disguised as prawns. Two years ago whale sausages were on open sale at Oslo airport, until the Norwegian government was pressured into clamping down on it. DNA tests on meat in Tokyo markets have shown that some of it comes from severely endangered species, such as the Mexican humpback. Many species of the great whales are still on the verge of extinction. The population of blue whales in the Southern hemisphere has fallen from 220,000 to just 460, while the population of the right whale has dropped from about 100,000 to 7,000. Conservationists argue that poachers of endangered species could use the legal international trade as cover. 'If there is legal trade, it makes illegal trade so much easier,' said Page. After the ban on trade in ivory was temporarily lifted three years ago there was a jump in the amount of illegal poaching. There is also concern that an international trade in whale meat will undermine the International Whaling Commission's ban on commercial whaling. Stroud said: 'Norway and Japan are trying to restart commercial whaling through the back-door.' The Japanese and Norwegian resolutions will be opposed by most developed nations, including the UK. Environment Minister Mi-chael Meacher told The Observer: 'We're completely opposed to a resumption of whaling. There is no immediate risk of extinction, but if there is a resumption of commercial whaling, it could have a dramatic impact on numbers.' However, since their defeat three years ago, both whaling countries have been involved in intense lobbying of developing nations to win their support. Japan has been openly offering aid to countries in Africa and the Caribbean in return for their vote on whaling issues. The whaling nations have also been active in cultivating a common cause with the African nations that want to restart the international ivory trade. Norway's whaling commissioner, Odd Gunnar Skagestad, told a Norwegian newspaper last week: 'We support the African countries that want to downlist the elephant on scientific grounds. We expect them to support our proposal as well.' anthony.browne@observer.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "A brutal guerrilla insurgency and scores of extra-judicial killings by police are undermining the once peaceful reputation of Nepal. A so-called 'people's war' against the kingdom's 10-year-old multi-party democracy is being waged in the western region by a Maoist faction of the Communist Party, which claims to control several districts. The government's latest figures put the death toll at 1,216, but most believe the figure is greater than 3,000. On Thursday, the Maoists called an armed bandh , or strike, across the whole of Nepal, paralysing the nation and leaving the streets of Kathmandu empty and its businesses closed. The government drafted in 7,000 police to the city and foreign embassies warned tourists to stay close to their hotels. Nine police were killed last Wednesday, eight of them in the remote village of Taksera, when 200 guerrillas attacked a police post. Evidence is growing that the police have lost discipline in remote areas and are carrying out scores of extra-judicial killings in retaliation for guerrilla attacks. The true figure could run into hundreds. One of the worst incidents occurred on 20 February, when 15 police, including an inspector, died as Maoists blew up the police post at Ghartigaun village in Rolpa. Two days later 30 police, acting on a tip-off that guerrillas were hiding nearby, arrived in Kumcheri village in the neighbouring Rukum district. Guerrillas hiding in jungle outside the village opened fire, killing one policeman. A rapid response unit set up by the police to deal with the insurgency arrived in the region by helicopter and immediately began burning houses and barns in villages with paraffin looted from local shops. Fifteen villagers, five of them supporters of the ruling Nepali Congress Party, were then shot by police as Maoist sympathisers. 'It was cold-blooded murder,' says Krishna Pahadi, a human rights worker based in Kathmandu who travelled to the area. 'The police pulled them from their houses, stood them in a line and shot them. The police authorities are claiming they were killed in an exchange of fire. The reality is that the police wanted to take revenge.' For their part, police said initially that those killed had been wearing uniforms and carrying rifles. The government promised a report on the killings within two weeks, but since Krishna Prasad Bhattarai was replaced as Prime Minister by hardliner Girija Prasad Koirala in March, it has not been published. The new Home Minister, Govinda Ray Joshi, told The Observer : 'We don't accept that there are extra-judicial killings in Nepal.' Saying that the report had been delivered and would be published 'in due course', he added: 'If the police have made any mistakes, then we'll take it very seriously. The police were excited, and maybe that's why that incident happened.' But human rights activists believe the police have stopped operating within the law. 'The police are doing this kind of thing in a systematic fashion,' says Pahadi. 'And the government refuses to take action against the police. The police are running the government because politicians believe they can't get re-elected without the help of the police.' In early February the United Nations and Amnesty International released reports heavily criticising the police and Nepal's recent human rights record. The issue will be raised by Foreign Secretary Robin Cook when he visits Nepal later this month. Nepal holds a number of political activists without charge or acknowledging habeas corpus , but The Observer has also found evidence that police in remote districts have killed detainees before abandoning their posts. Three bodies were recently discovered at Simrudu police station, close to where the 15 villagers were murdered. Fearing Maoist reprisals, the police abandoned the station. Last week local people reported that three bodies had been found buried inside the building. Two were sisters, Sita Pun, 13, and Sirjana Pun, 16, who had been detained in August at what police said was a Maoist meeting. Villagers accused the police of raping the sisters and killing them before quitting the post. The body of Satya Deva Sharma, also held without charge, was found in an abandoned police post in Salyan district. Despite regular reassurances that legislation passed in 1996 to set up a National Human Rights Commission would be acted on, the government still has to name its first members. Rights act-ivists believe the government is stalling to allow security forces a free hand in dealing with the Maoist insurgency. The rebel group is part of the London-based Revolutionary Internationalist Committee and has links to the Shining Path movement in Peru and Maoist groups in northern India. Begun in February 1996, the Maoist struggle wasn't taken too seriously at first, but in the remote terrain of the mid-western hills of Nepal, guerrilla tactics have allowed the Maoists to establish several zones of control, all based around groups of villages far from roads or towns. Led by Comrade Pra-chanda, a 45-year-old former agriculture student whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Maoists mix intellectual fervour for world revolution with robbing banks and stealing food. The Maoists claim they target only police and police informers, but local people, businessmen and non-government organisations still operating in the affected areas report widespread extortion and intimidation. The rebels either manufacture their own weapons or steal rifles from the police, usually antiquated .303s of British origin. The group's leaders are believed to be hiding in India, where key party workers are trained in insurgency techniques.",

      "trailText": "<p>A bank across the Atlantic deciding to close down hundreds of rural branches would be dealt with by the law</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Last week, as Barclays CEO Matthew Barrett drew closer to collecting his \u00a330.5 million bonus, his bank announced the closure of 172 branches, a tenth of its system, mostly in rural areas. There ought to be a law! And there is, but once again, it only applies in the US. </p> <p>America's Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) bars closing a branch unless the bank can prove to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve or the courts that it will continue to look after the community's banking needs. </p> <p>NatWest executives might provide the Blair Government with some experienced advice on this matter. While its new owner, Royal Bank of Scotland, has and will close scores of branches in the UK with impunity, the acquirer of NatWest's US operations, Fleet Bank, had to pony up several hundred million dollars to fund low-income, rural and small business lending programmes to maintain and expand financial services to American customers it hoped to dump. </p> <p>You may call Bill Clinton a scamp, a perjurer and a hypocrite (and I do), but when it comes to protecting community banks, he's a champ. In October, Clinton made Wall Street gasp when he steadfastly refused to sign a financial deregulation Bill until the Senate removed provisions weakening the CRA. </p> <p>Walk into any bank in the US and you can ask for the CRA files which state, for example, the number and size of loans given out in the branch's community, identified by postal code and divided by income grouping and race. Altogether, banks seeking merger approvals or branch relocations have been forced to commit over $4 trillion to not-for-profit loan funds. </p> <p>The Archbishop of Wales, Rowan Williams, suggests turning Britain's abandoned banks into community credit unions. But rather than call for the surrounding of local Barclays with pickets or organising sit-ins at the offices of shoulder-shrugging Ministers, the Archbishop seems resigned to administering last rites to the closing branches. 'It's a bit utopian to imagine that government can intervene to make the banks behave.' </p> <p>The meek may inherit the earth, your worship, but seizing the bank buildings will restore the communities' financial services. In 1984, on New York's Lower East Side, Father Jack Kenington organised poor immigrants in the takeover of a closing bank branch. Today, it is the Peoples' Federal Credit Union - the first of a wave of conversions of banks to community credit unions - the fruit of in-your-face non-violent direct actions and lawsuits that forced the passage and implementation of CRA. </p> <p>But when a good soul like the archbishop disparages his own demand for reform as 'utopian', the call to action decays into another lesson in public acquiescence. Dismissing victims' right to sue price-fixers as 'not part of our culture' is further training in civic submission. </p> <p>You can hear the audible national sigh: there's nothing we can do . Who knows where Americans get their righteous sense that government owes them justice against powerful economic forces? How happy for Tony Blair that a subdued public expects so little of their leaders. </p> <p><strong> Microsoft: A call to arms</strong><br> I called America today and, to my surprise, it was still there. Mom and Dad in California and big sister in Washington, coming up out of their deep shelters, squinted into their first glimpses of sunlight since Monday when Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson dropped The Bomb - his ruling against Microsoft. </p> <p>Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer had warned that a judgment against the company would mean the end of 'the freedom that is driving our economy' - the American way of life was at risk. Who knew what civil upheaval would ensue? The prudent barricaded themselves in preparation for the worst. </p> <p>Yet, America survived intact. Its lovers still cry, its poets still dream and McDonalds' employees still lack health insurance. Yes, the Nasdaq stock exchange fainted, but like Romeo's and Juliet's suicides, this dramatic act was unjustified by the facts. Judge Jackson's ruling was a virtual photocopy of his Findings of Fact issued in October which then sent the market rocketing upward. </p> <p>The value of Jackson's ruling to the British public - beyond the giddy satisfaction of watching a centi-billionaire nerd pantsed and paddled by the court - eluded me until, dozing through the drizzle that passes for journalism on the topic of Monopoly Bill, I was jerked awake by the Guardian 's advice to the judge. An editorial admonished the US court to impose heavy fines to punish Microsoft for ripping off Joe and Josephine Bloggs with unconscionably high charges for Windows. </p> <p>Strange advice from Farringdon Road, London. The suggestion is better directed down the street to HM Office of Fair Trading (OFT) which, six weeks ago, gained the legal authority to fine monopolists. For the OFT, this should be a no-brainer. Judge Jackson ruled that Microsoft's evil-doings were 'worldwide' in scope. </p> <p>And, to make the OFT's job easier, unlike secretive European monopoly investigations the US Justice Department posts all its evidence on the Web. UK authorities and curious insomniacs can download hundreds of hysterical, petulant and self-incriminating e-mails by Bill Gates and his buddies at <a href=\"http://www.usdoj.gov\">www.usdoj.gov</a>.</p> <p>For the record, the OFT informs me it has 'no investigation and no plan for investigating' Microsoft. The Guardian (besides aiming its advice at the wrong nation), in emphasising state-imposed fines, evidenced a common misunderstanding of what makes US competition law work - at least by comparison to the sorry codes in Europe. The simple brilliance of US anti-trust law is not in punishing the price fixers (though it does that, with fines or jail time) but in compensating victims . If Gates's bully-boy tactics added $20 to the price of Windows, then every PC jockey in America would get a check for $60, triple the overcharge. </p> <p>Americophilic columnist Jonathan Freedland postulates that tougher, citizen friendly anti-trust laws in the States are rooted in the progressive theories of enlightened turn-of-the-century capitalists seeking to keep the marketplace free and fair. </p> <p>Washington anti-trust lawyer Kenneth Adams has a closer view. 'Americans have 200 million hand guns. We've always had guns. If we didn't have a way for the average guy to get his money back, there'd be war.' The 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act was the desperate defence of America's monied class aimed at defusing the Populist movement, a million armed farmers on the verge of insurrection against the railroad barons. </p> <p>Last month, the OFT uncovered a ring of 14 Volvo dealers in a secret price-boosting pact. But this Government has not, and cannot, order them to give the thousands of pounds in overcharges back to their customers. No question that if it happened in the US, there would be bullet holes in the salesrooms and blood on the bonnets. </p> <p>Moreover, in the States, no victim has to wait for the government to nail the bad guys. Any overcharged customer can file a Sherman Act suit, even if the government concludes no monopoly exists. </p> <p>That's what drives the system. While Joel Klein, head of the US Justice Department's trust-busting unit, deserves credit for bringing Gates to heel, the Government's case only followed the path cleared by private suits brought by Microsoft's injured competitors, Netscape and Sun. </p> <p>Klein's unit has slammed monopolists for nearly $3 billion in fines over the past decade; but that is peanuts compared with the collections by millions of victims in class action suits totalling many times the government's take. </p> <p>In Britain, ripped-off consumers have to wait upon timid, befuddled, underfunded and politically vulnerable agencies such as the OFT to take up their defence. Their targets are few, action is rare, and compensation is out of the question. </p> <p>Or maybe not. If Judge Jackson concludes that monopoly power jacked up the price of Windows (and that judgment is still pending), 'anyone in Britain can and should apply for their money'. That is the word from, of all people, a Microsoft attorney who unsurprisingly requests anonymity. </p> <p>Of course, unless you live in the centre of a metropolis, you may have trouble finding a bank in which to deposit your payout.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last week, as Barclays CEO Matthew Barrett drew closer to collecting his \u00a330.5 million bonus, his bank announced the closure of 172 branches, a tenth of its system, mostly in rural areas. There ought to be a law! And there is, but once again, it only applies in the US. America's Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) bars closing a branch unless the bank can prove to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve or the courts that it will continue to look after the community's banking needs. NatWest executives might provide the Blair Government with some experienced advice on this matter. While its new owner, Royal Bank of Scotland, has and will close scores of branches in the UK with impunity, the acquirer of NatWest's US operations, Fleet Bank, had to pony up several hundred million dollars to fund low-income, rural and small business lending programmes to maintain and expand financial services to American customers it hoped to dump. You may call Bill Clinton a scamp, a perjurer and a hypocrite (and I do), but when it comes to protecting community banks, he's a champ. In October, Clinton made Wall Street gasp when he steadfastly refused to sign a financial deregulation Bill until the Senate removed provisions weakening the CRA. Walk into any bank in the US and you can ask for the CRA files which state, for example, the number and size of loans given out in the branch's community, identified by postal code and divided by income grouping and race. Altogether, banks seeking merger approvals or branch relocations have been forced to commit over $4 trillion to not-for-profit loan funds. The Archbishop of Wales, Rowan Williams, suggests turning Britain's abandoned banks into community credit unions. But rather than call for the surrounding of local Barclays with pickets or organising sit-ins at the offices of shoulder-shrugging Ministers, the Archbishop seems resigned to administering last rites to the closing branches. 'It's a bit utopian to imagine that government can intervene to make the banks behave.' The meek may inherit the earth, your worship, but seizing the bank buildings will restore the communities' financial services. In 1984, on New York's Lower East Side, Father Jack Kenington organised poor immigrants in the takeover of a closing bank branch. Today, it is the Peoples' Federal Credit Union - the first of a wave of conversions of banks to community credit unions - the fruit of in-your-face non-violent direct actions and lawsuits that forced the passage and implementation of CRA. But when a good soul like the archbishop disparages his own demand for reform as 'utopian', the call to action decays into another lesson in public acquiescence. Dismissing victims' right to sue price-fixers as 'not part of our culture' is further training in civic submission. You can hear the audible national sigh: there's nothing we can do . Who knows where Americans get their righteous sense that government owes them justice against powerful economic forces? How happy for Tony Blair that a subdued public expects so little of their leaders. Microsoft: A call to arms I called America today and, to my surprise, it was still there. Mom and Dad in California and big sister in Washington, coming up out of their deep shelters, squinted into their first glimpses of sunlight since Monday when Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson dropped The Bomb - his ruling against Microsoft. Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer had warned that a judgment against the company would mean the end of 'the freedom that is driving our economy' - the American way of life was at risk. Who knew what civil upheaval would ensue? The prudent barricaded themselves in preparation for the worst. Yet, America survived intact. Its lovers still cry, its poets still dream and McDonalds' employees still lack health insurance. Yes, the Nasdaq stock exchange fainted, but like Romeo's and Juliet's suicides, this dramatic act was unjustified by the facts. Judge Jackson's ruling was a virtual photocopy of his Findings of Fact issued in October which then sent the market rocketing upward. The value of Jackson's ruling to the British public - beyond the giddy satisfaction of watching a centi-billionaire nerd pantsed and paddled by the court - eluded me until, dozing through the drizzle that passes for journalism on the topic of Monopoly Bill, I was jerked awake by the Guardian 's advice to the judge. An editorial admonished the US court to impose heavy fines to punish Microsoft for ripping off Joe and Josephine Bloggs with unconscionably high charges for Windows. Strange advice from Farringdon Road, London. The suggestion is better directed down the street to HM Office of Fair Trading (OFT) which, six weeks ago, gained the legal authority to fine monopolists. For the OFT, this should be a no-brainer. Judge Jackson ruled that Microsoft's evil-doings were 'worldwide' in scope. And, to make the OFT's job easier, unlike secretive European monopoly investigations the US Justice Department posts all its evidence on the Web. UK authorities and curious insomniacs can download hundreds of hysterical, petulant and self-incriminating e-mails by Bill Gates and his buddies at www.usdoj.gov. For the record, the OFT informs me it has 'no investigation and no plan for investigating' Microsoft. The Guardian (besides aiming its advice at the wrong nation), in emphasising state-imposed fines, evidenced a common misunderstanding of what makes US competition law work - at least by comparison to the sorry codes in Europe. The simple brilliance of US anti-trust law is not in punishing the price fixers (though it does that, with fines or jail time) but in compensating victims . If Gates's bully-boy tactics added $20 to the price of Windows, then every PC jockey in America would get a check for $60, triple the overcharge. Americophilic columnist Jonathan Freedland postulates that tougher, citizen friendly anti-trust laws in the States are rooted in the progressive theories of enlightened turn-of-the-century capitalists seeking to keep the marketplace free and fair. Washington anti-trust lawyer Kenneth Adams has a closer view. 'Americans have 200 million hand guns. We've always had guns. If we didn't have a way for the average guy to get his money back, there'd be war.' The 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act was the desperate defence of America's monied class aimed at defusing the Populist movement, a million armed farmers on the verge of insurrection against the railroad barons. Last month, the OFT uncovered a ring of 14 Volvo dealers in a secret price-boosting pact. But this Government has not, and cannot, order them to give the thousands of pounds in overcharges back to their customers. No question that if it happened in the US, there would be bullet holes in the salesrooms and blood on the bonnets. Moreover, in the States, no victim has to wait for the government to nail the bad guys. Any overcharged customer can file a Sherman Act suit, even if the government concludes no monopoly exists. That's what drives the system. While Joel Klein, head of the US Justice Department's trust-busting unit, deserves credit for bringing Gates to heel, the Government's case only followed the path cleared by private suits brought by Microsoft's injured competitors, Netscape and Sun. Klein's unit has slammed monopolists for nearly $3 billion in fines over the past decade; but that is peanuts compared with the collections by millions of victims in class action suits totalling many times the government's take. In Britain, ripped-off consumers have to wait upon timid, befuddled, underfunded and politically vulnerable agencies such as the OFT to take up their defence. Their targets are few, action is rare, and compensation is out of the question. Or maybe not. If Judge Jackson concludes that monopoly power jacked up the price of Windows (and that judgment is still pending), 'anyone in Britain can and should apply for their money'. That is the word from, of all people, a Microsoft attorney who unsurprisingly requests anonymity. Of course, unless you live in the centre of a metropolis, you may have trouble finding a bank in which to deposit your payout.",

'After all these years, we will finally be able to demand a full expla nation of the circumstances surrounding his death.' Sabrina Mesrine, who with the help of her paternal grandmother first filed a complaint against the police for 'unlawful assassination' days after the killing, has never given up hope of proving her father was gunned down in cold blood without being given a chance to surrender. Known for more than a decade as Public Enemy Number One, Mesrine was in fact a public hero in France, a romantic Robin Hood figure who predicted his own bloody end at the hands of the police, but was always a step ahead of his pursuers during a spectacular career of bank robberies, kidnappings and jail breaks. He endeared himself to the intellectual Left for campaigning against inhumane prison conditions. The super-crook infuriated the police - particularly Commissioner Robert Broussard, then head of the Paris flying squad - by giving numerous newspaper interviews.

According to Broussard, who endured years of public opprobrium as 'the man who murdered Mesrine' before finally publishing his version of events in 1997, the police marksmen 'only opened fire because Mesrine appeared to duck down to get something from under the car seat, instead of raising his hands.'

      "body": "<p>There are radicals, and then there are people who change your life. Bernie Grant was both for me. I can remember the precise moment I realised he was not just a politician but something more - a man with the combination of personal courage and moral belief that marks the truly independent politician.</p> <p>No one could mistake where he stood politically, but this was no knee-jerk leftie. He could and did surprise me, again and again.</p> <p>In 1988 I sat in a draughty hall in Tottenham, listening to angry parents from the Broadwater Farm estate. My aunt lived on the edge of the Farm so I had a personal interest. Like her, they were outraged at the failure of the council to clean up the area. They were furious about the persistent disdavantage facing their children. And above all, they were enraged by the harassment of those children by the local police.</p> <p>At the front of the hall sat a row of officials, taking notes. As the voices become more strident, the bureaucrats glanced nervously at the impassive, neatly-bearded figure at the centre of the table.</p> <p>Bernie, the local MP only since he had only won the seat the year before, was one of the best known figures in British politics. Infamously outspoken and left-wing, when his turn came to speak, his passion was evident. But this was no rabble-rousing rant. He calmly and eloquently urged the audience not just to complain but to make things change. 'When you elected me, you didn't just vote for me to say how bad everything is. You put me there to make things different,' he said. 'Give me your support.' It was compelling, and no one else I know could have carried it off.</p> <p>The trust was merited. Today people in Tottenham will tell you his tireless championing of the area has made a huge difference. It is neater, the police have a more respectful attitude, most residents feel safer.</p> <p>Bernie embodied what may seem like a paradox. On the one hand he was a radical who never gave up his values, and would certainly never have been described as New Labour. On the other his political impact on this Labour Government was probably as great as that of any backbencher. He was a prag matic politician, invited to advise Tony Blair and Jack Straw on the issues close to his heart - the fight against racism, the Caribbean economy, the regeneration of inner cities.</p> <p>His defence of the monarchy as a force that bound Britain to the Commonwealth surprised many but showed him to be both original and creative in his approach to foreign politics. His attendance at the Commons, in spite of his health, was testimony to his courage. He was often so tired that we would have to hold him upright as he negotiated stairs. Yet he would never take a break.</p> <p>Bernie was the political and personal mentor of many younger black Britons. Rumbustious, opinionated and direct, he or his political soulmate - his wife, Sharon - would call me at all hours to advise, cajole and scold. Bernie would open fire: 'I saw you on TV.

      "bodyText": "There are radicals, and then there are people who change your life. Bernie Grant was both for me. I can remember the precise moment I realised he was not just a politician but something more - a man with the combination of personal courage and moral belief that marks the truly independent politician. No one could mistake where he stood politically, but this was no knee-jerk leftie. He could and did surprise me, again and again. In 1988 I sat in a draughty hall in Tottenham, listening to angry parents from the Broadwater Farm estate. My aunt lived on the edge of the Farm so I had a personal interest. Like her, they were outraged at the failure of the council to clean up the area. They were furious about the persistent disdavantage facing their children. And above all, they were enraged by the harassment of those children by the local police. At the front of the hall sat a row of officials, taking notes. As the voices become more strident, the bureaucrats glanced nervously at the impassive, neatly-bearded figure at the centre of the table. Bernie, the local MP only since he had only won the seat the year before, was one of the best known figures in British politics. Infamously outspoken and left-wing, when his turn came to speak, his passion was evident. But this was no rabble-rousing rant. He calmly and eloquently urged the audience not just to complain but to make things change. 'When you elected me, you didn't just vote for me to say how bad everything is. You put me there to make things different,' he said. 'Give me your support.' It was compelling, and no one else I know could have carried it off. The trust was merited. Today people in Tottenham will tell you his tireless championing of the area has made a huge difference. It is neater, the police have a more respectful attitude, most residents feel safer. Bernie embodied what may seem like a paradox. On the one hand he was a radical who never gave up his values, and would certainly never have been described as New Labour. On the other his political impact on this Labour Government was probably as great as that of any backbencher. He was a prag matic politician, invited to advise Tony Blair and Jack Straw on the issues close to his heart - the fight against racism, the Caribbean economy, the regeneration of inner cities. His defence of the monarchy as a force that bound Britain to the Commonwealth surprised many but showed him to be both original and creative in his approach to foreign politics. His attendance at the Commons, in spite of his health, was testimony to his courage. He was often so tired that we would have to hold him upright as he negotiated stairs. Yet he would never take a break. Bernie was the political and personal mentor of many younger black Britons. Rumbustious, opinionated and direct, he or his political soulmate - his wife, Sharon - would call me at all hours to advise, cajole and scold. Bernie would open fire: 'I saw you on TV. You were good, but you need to be better.' He would then explain how, with the certainty and assurance of an elder statesman. You could not resent it. He wanted all of us to succeed. In recent times I came to value his guidance more than almost any other of my political friends. It was s hardly surprising that we would get on weWe came from the same background - poor but respectable Guyanese families. Though separated by a decade or so in age, we were educated at rival boys' schools in Georgetown and reared on old-fashioned values of decency, good manners and hard work. He started life in the chemical industry, working as an analyst in the bauxite plants of Guyana, I in petrochemicals. When he came to London to work, Bernie sat next to my brother in the telephone exchange where they both worked. Later he and Sharon lived in the next street to me and my family, for the best part of 15 years. For many his death leaves a void in a Britain short of figures we can admire and emulate. But two great projects, into both of which he swept me with his enthusiasm, may come to be his monuments. Bernie encouraged me to complete a series of TV programmes showing the decisive contribution of the slave trade to Britain's industrial and military might; he then persuaded me to join the campaign to erect of a monument to the unknown slave on the plinth in Trafalgar Square. He also roped many of us into his scheme for a Centre for the Performing Arts in Tottenham, aimed at showcasing the talents of young Londoners, and creating jobs for people in the area. In both cases, the aim is grand, but the project eminently practical. Bernie's true legacy is that there are many of us will never rest until his radical dreams are made hard reality.",

The Chechens have long been blamed for murdering the Red Cross nurses and the beheading of four British telephone engineers: 'You've got to ask, who gains? The Chechens? No. The Kremlin? Yes.' She paused to light another fag. 'I read about the Holocaust again and again to find how to stop it...' She returns to Chechnya and the killing of civilians blasted by Russian artillery, vacuum bombs, the works. Her intensity is almost unbearable. Yet I've been to Chechnya; I've seen what Putin did to one village, Katyr Yurt, and I agree with virtually every word. Nor is she about to give up. Later this month Putin is expected in London to open the Russia 2000 trade fair. Vanessa will be there, on a picket line. 'Vodka, made in Russia, is something we could all do without. And certainly we shouldn't sell Putin any planes or weapons or lend money. Any honest person needs to say, \"OK what can I do?\" Don't drink Russian vodka.' I tell her my kids are enormously impressed that I am meeting the villain, Max, she played in the film Mission:Impossible . She writes a note to them, 'from a Mission Impossible lady'. 'I enjoyed doing that film,' she said. I teased her with the possibility of her doing a Bond villain. 'I'd love to.' And you could be pretty sure her fee wouldn't be spent on world domination. Quite the contrary. \u0095 Euan Ferguson is away",

      "bodyText": "Britain's adoption services are in such a shambles that there are more than 5,000 children in care who have been promised homes but have yet to be found one. The first ever national survey of adoption services by the Social Services Inspectorate has slammed them as 'unacceptable'. Health Minister John Hutton said urgent reform was needed. The study found that thousands of children were waiting for a home because local authorities made little effort to find appropriate families for them. There were wide variations across the country, with many social services departments admitting they had made no effort to recruit adoptive parents for more than a year. Many social service departments didn't even know how many children they had been looking after for more than six months. More than 5,000 children who had been in care more than six months were scheduled for adoption. The report concluded this was 'unacceptably high'. More than half the social services departments didn't even have a target timescale for achieving adoption. Many children who did have an adoption plan hadn't even been assigned a social worker. No local authorites have trouble finding adoptive parents for babies, because there is high demand for them. However, while there was a pool of 1,297 approved adopters who had no children placed with them, there were 2,400 children waiting to be placed. The Department of Health believes this is because social service departments are not recruiting the appropriate type of potential parents, and being very inefficient about matching them with children. Hutton said: 'Whilst the report showed that there are pockets of good practice on adoption, there is obviously a hardcore of local authorities who are still lagging behind.'",

The problems have raised serious concerns in the water industry that plans to cut up to 10,000 jobs over the next five years will jeopardise health and environmental protection and improvements to drinking water. The hi-tech plants, which use ultra-violet lights to prevent reproduction of bacteria in sewage pumped into the sea, are being turned off from this month by Welsh Water, part of utility group Hyder. The company is also cutting back on work to protect hundreds of homes infected annually with raw sewage and on plans to replace lead pipes in line with European drinking water regulations. Environment Minister Michael Meacher has been warned of the problems at meetings with MPs and trade unions. Union officials told Meacher at an emergency meeting last month that plans by water companies to cut the industry's 30,000 workforce by up to a third are overstretching workers, with potentially disastrous consequences. Water companies have already shed 20 per cent of staff between 1993 and 1998. Meacher has written to industry watchdog Ian Byatt instructing him to take enforcement action against companies which do not meet legal requirements. He told The Observer there was no question of companies escaping their responsibilities for improving drinking water standards, health and safety regulations and environmental protection. 'These companies have five-year plans to carry out these improvements. If they do not carry them out I will certainly want to know why.' One union official from Anglian Water who attended the Meacher meeting said: 'Sewage plants or pumping stations which we used to visit at least every week get checked once a month now. A major incident on the scale of Camelford [where drinking water was infected] is only a matter of time.' Similar concerns were voiced to Meacher by workers at Yorkshire Water.

Essex has lost 126 officers in the past year and is struggling to replace them - the starting salaries of \u00a316,635 are not attractive enough for new recruits.

They have discovered how to zap photons - individual particles of light - around laboratories. Anton Zeilinger, of the Institute of Experimental Physics at Vienna University states in the latest issue of Scientific American: 'Teleportation has become a lab reality - for photons.' Such work could nevertheless have revolutionary consequences, particularly in the development of ranges of computers which would teleport - rather than push - photons round their components, enabling them to run thousands of times faster than current devices. Most people think of teleportation as the means by which Scotty beamed up Captain Kirk, though this was only introduced to Star Trek because Gene Roddenberry, the creator of the series, wanted to avoid simulating expensive spaceship landings. To make such a teleporter, an engineer would have to develop a scanner to extract every scrap of information about a person's atomic and sub-atomic make-up; beam it to a destination; and then use it as a recipe to reassemble that individual from atoms available there. Great fun, said scientists, but utterly impractical.

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch is poised to win a huge concession from the Government which would leave him undisputed master of his satellite television interests. It would also leave Labour open to accusations of pandering to Murdoch to secure the support of his mass circulation newspapers at the next general election. Murdoch executives have been lobbying Whitehall for help against a takeover threat from the French communications giant Vivendi. Murdoch is reported to have said he wants Vivendi's chairman, Jean-Marie Messier, 'off my back'. Publicly, the two business giants are engaged in amicable merger talks. Murdoch's position has been given an enormousboost by a secret report recently submitted to the Trade and Industry Secre tary, Stephen Byers. It recommends that Vivendi be forced to sell its 25 per cent holding in BSkyB. This report is rumoured to follow the striking of a private deal between the Prime Minister and Murdoch, which is seen as compensation for the Government's earlier decision to bar BSkyB from taking over Manchester United football club. The recommendation would put Vivendi's holding on to the market, with unpredictable effects on BSkyB's share price and future ownership, but would free Murdoch of the threat of losing control of the satellite company he founded a decade ago. It would allow him to go ahead with a plan to merge all his satellite interest under one holding company, based in the United States. A Trade and Industry de-partment source insisted yesterday that no final decision has been taken. 'The report has reached the department, but it hasn't crossed the Secretary of State's desk yet.' Messier has been pushing for a merger of BSkyB and Canal Plus, the French pay-TV company in which Vivendi is a big shareholder. The French firm could be a bigger shareholder in the merged enterprise than Murdoch's News Corporation, which holds 40 per cent of Sky. The Competition Commission report argues that this merger would be against the public interest, because the market power of the merged business would enable it to force down the prices it pays for broadcasting rights for live matches and movies. But supporters of the merger argue that the price of sports events would be unchanged because English and French audiences are not interested in watching each other's fixtures. They also say that Hollywood can afford to lose some of the revenue it gets from allowing old films to be shown on European television. It is also understood that Vivendi is prepared to give guarantees not to depress prices. Byers's decision, last November, to refer Vivendi's 25 per cent stake in Sky to the Competition Commission surprised the industry. Rival executives called it a 'bizarre decision' and 'an act of appeasement towards Murdoch'. Since he took over leadership of the Labour Party nearly six years ago, Blair has displayed what critics claim is an eagerness to reach an accomodation with News Corporation. More recently, the Prime Minister demonstrated his concern for Murdoch's business interests when he rang Romano Prodi, then the Italian Prime Minister, to sound out the political reaction to Murdoch's plans to buy into Italy's newspaper industry. But relations between Murdoch and Labour have been strained by the newspaper magnate's intense opposition to British membership of the European single currency. It is not known whether the Competition Commission will also decide to block a holding by France Telecom in cable company NTL, which Byers referred to the body at the same time as the Vivendi stake in BSkyB.",

      "bodyText": "For years it has been the greatest question in the world of human endeavour: why does anyone want to risk death, injury and disaster climbing Mount Everest? Now it has been solved. The glib answer given by early pioneer George Mallory - 'because it's there' - can be dismissed as disingenuous if not downright deceptive. A recently published study by two behavioural psychologists says 'pathologically narcissistic, competitive and regressive dynamics' lead men to climb mountains. The study, by American and New Zealand-based psychologists, uses 'psychodynamic and structuralist theory' to analyse the climbing disaster on Everest in May 1996 in which five people died. But allegations that mountain men are 'overdependent on external admiration ... intensely envious, exploitative in relations with others' possibly due to 'inadequate mothering' has stung \u00e9lite mountaineers. Alan Hinkes, who has scaled 11 of the world's highest peaks, was indignant at the idea that he had developed 'an unhealthy structure of self representing a failure in the emancipation from the self-object'. Hinkes, a Yorkshireman, said he climbed for fun. 'You are out exercising in the middle of fantastic scenery with some good mates. It is a very simple pleasure... that's all,' he said. The report - Deliverance, Denial and the Death Zone - is based on testimony by survivors of the so-called 'Great Storm' on Everest four years ago and draws particularly on Jon Krakauer's best-selling book Into Thin Air. It examines the psychology of the guides leading the ill-fated climbs, as well as the motivations of clients paying up to $65,000 each for a chance to conquer the mountain. 'A lot of these people were basically buying attention, prestige and self-esteem. They did not have the background of established mountaineers,' said Professor Michael Elmes, of Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Massachusetts, a co-author of the report. Elmes said such people need 'extreme sports'. 'There are reasons why these pursuits are popular among adolescents. They can be a compensation for all kinds of inadequacies.' Some climbers agree. A Himalayan veteran said that months spent sharing 'smelly tents in horrible cold with foul food and even fouler partners' had disillusioned him.'High-altitude mountaineers - myself included - must be among the most dysfunctional, anti-social, self-obsessed people around,' he said. But Hinkes, who leaves Britain tomorrow for India to climb Kanchenjunga - the world's third highest mountain - said: 'Maybe mountaineers should... do a study of narcissism, competition and the desire for fame among academics.' jason.burke@observer.co.uk",

Like other car companies whose twentieth-century records were blemished by links with Nazi Germany such as Ford and Saab, Volkswagen is judged on more recent history. The German firm wins all five car classes in Ethical Consumer magazine which awards or deducts points on issues ranging from animal welfare to arms trading. Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn, makers of the 2CV beloved by hippies, comes a close second but loses key credits for links with the defence industry. The report is particularly bad news for British-made models, including Vauxhalls, Rovers and Hondas. BMW, already under attack for ditching Rover and putting jobs at risk, performs poorly in the workers' rights section. 'Rover Group prevented its employees from speaking out by including a gagging clause in the workers' contracts,' the magazine says.

Its business activity in countries such as Indonesia and selling Land Rovers for military use are condemned.

It seems barely a week goes by without The Observer or the Guardian telling readers that tomorrow's pensioners should forget about saving towards a pension because they'd be better off on benefits. This Government is working hard to help those of today's pensioners who haven't had the opportunity to save to have a sufficient income in retirement.

Exposing the myth that only a small minority of families have difficulties, the research reveals it is commonplace for parents to be battered by their offspring.</p> <p>The extent of family rifts was investigated by the charity Parentline Plus which has had 10,000 calls within a year of launching its confidential helpline number. Three quarters of calls came from parents who believed their children were 'manipulative, spoilt and anti-social'.</p> <p>Experts believe a simple lack of communication between parents and teenagers is causing an escalating problem in an increasingly high-pressure world.</p> <p>'The prevalence of abuse of parents is still taboo,' said forensic and family psychologist Professor Kevin Brown of Birmingham University, who recently questioned first-year students about conflict in the family home.

      "bodyText": "Horrific levels of violence by teenagers against their parents have been uncovered by a report tackling the taboo topic of adolescent thuggery in the home. Exposing the myth that only a small minority of families have difficulties, the research reveals it is commonplace for parents to be battered by their offspring. The extent of family rifts was investigated by the charity Parentline Plus which has had 10,000 calls within a year of launching its confidential helpline number. Three quarters of calls came from parents who believed their children were 'manipulative, spoilt and anti-social'. Experts believe a simple lack of communication between parents and teenagers is causing an escalating problem in an increasingly high-pressure world. 'The prevalence of abuse of parents is still taboo,' said forensic and family psychologist Professor Kevin Brown of Birmingham University, who recently questioned first-year students about conflict in the family home. 'These were intelligent people yet 14 per cent admitted having hit their parents with 4 per cent having been severely violent toward a parent,' he said. 'Four out of five said they had been victims of their parents' violence. Other figures show 25 per cent of single mothers will be hit by their teenagers, many re-enacting violence they witnessed by the long-absent father. Overall up to 12 per cent of families are involved in situations where teenagers hit their parents.' The importance of the Parentline study lies in the fact that parents were able to speak anonymously and therefore 'say the unsayable' by admitting to feelings about their own children which are still taboo. A typical case is Sarah, who spoke to The Observer only on condition of anonymity. While outsiders might expect Sarah, a mother and stepmother, to be delighted to have her family around her to celebrate her birthday, it was with dread that she heard her 17-year-old stepson would be there. Brendan was a delightful toddler and a bright child, but in his teens turned almost overnight into a raging, foul-mouthed, violent and 'extremely stroppy adolescent'. From constant verbal abuse, such as calling Sarah a 'slag', to punching her in the face, the situation eased only when he packed his bags and stormed out of the family home to live elsewhere. Sarah said: 'I don't know if I'd actually hate him but I don't like him one bit. After so much my maternal instincts have shut down on him. I'm not afraid of him, I'm just contemptuous - he's just a spoilt brat.' Most parents experiencing problems have nobody to ask for help. It is not easy to admit that your child is a nightmare. But Sarah has learnt she has to communicate about the problem to cope. Modern families have to cope with more stress than ever before. Parentline found issues facing step-parents were exacerbated by the numbers of people involved. Stepfathers had particular difficulties with their role. Not surprisingly, sex is one of the biggest sources of conflict, particularly for fathers who discover their teenage daughters are sexually active. Fathers having to deal with teenage daughters who are learning to be sexually provocative is a common area of friction. 'When issues are not discussed it is easy for a situation to develop when teenagers will just lash out,' said Brown. 'Parents cannot just blame the child: they have to reduce the level of criticism, reduce the derogatory remarks, increase positive remarks and praising the child. It's about family therapy really.' Therapy was called for in the Conway household last week when Richard and Elaine left their 13-year-old alone for just over two hours. They returned to find him standing, like the Kevin character created by comic Harry Enfield, amid trashed furniture and lager-soaked carpets in their home at St Ives, Cambridgeshire. Adam told a few mates he had the house to himself, but claims he was suddenly overwhelmed by teenage gatecrashers.

Thatcher, who received a two-match ban and a reprimand from the England coach Kevin Keegan for elbowing the Sunderland man when the teams met at Selhurst Park, was nowhere to be seen in Wimbledon's squad. Summerbee was relegated to the bench, with Michael Gray taking his position on the right side of midfield. It was Gray who created an early chance by threading the ball through to Jody Craddock, who directed his shot straight at Neil Sullivan. Niall Quinn turned provider by chipping the ball into the heart of the penalty box where it needed a timely interception by the Wimbledon captain Kenny Cunningham to prevent Eric Roy lining up a shot from 12 yards. Wimbledon's chief source of danger came from the long-range shooting of the Israeli Walid Badir. Two efforts from well outside the area were struck firmly and brought smart saves from Thomas Sorensen. Even so it was indifferent fare. Quinn had a header saved under the crossbar by Sullivan, while 27-goal Kevin Phillips was wide with an 18-yard volley. There was a chance for Sunderland when a header from Phillips from Kevin Kilbane's cross drifted beyond the far post to Quinn whose attempt to return was blocked. After the break a free-kick just beyond the 'D' offered Michael Hughes a chance. His shot struck the defensive wall and the rebound was hoisted high over by Cunningham. Sunderland then took the lead in the 56th minute when a long free-kick by Alex Rae dropped for Quinn to strike a sweet volley into the corner. It was so out of character with much of the rest. But Hughes equalised with a deflected 25-yard drive that wrong-footed Sorensen, but Sunderland were not finished. Kilbane won it for them with a goal put on a plate by Quinn's far-post knock-back.",

      "byline": "Ian Ridley at The City Ground",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The paradise of the Premiership is postponed for Charlton Athletic. Results elsewhere meant that victory yesterday, one which looked theirs for so long, would have sent them up but instead a late, dubious penalty denied them all three points. They now look set to confirm their return after just a season's absence on Friday night at home to Huddersfield. </p> <p>Though never at their fluent best, Alan Curbishley's side took a lead through Andy Hunt but, to David Platt's relief, in a frantic finale his Forest team grabbed a precious point in their relegation struggle thanks to Chris Bart-Williams's penalty. Experienced manager vs rookie; even if the result does not tell the story, the league table does not lie. </p> <p>Charlton's fans were in party mood from the moment the 78 coaches ferrying their number up the M1 - the cost paid by a generous and grateful club - left London in the morning. They spilled round from one end of the City Ground into a stand, their yellow replica shirts providing a colourful backdrop. </p> <p>Their players' initial response hardly reflected the spectacle, however. Indeed there seemed to be a nervousness to them. They were fortunate that Forest, despite a 3-0 win at Crewe last week, were still short of confidence after a previous run of two points from five games. </p> <p>Too often Forest were strung out, relying on individual moments and leaving things to each other rather than supporting the player with the ball. </p> <p>When Marlon Harewood crossed from the left, only Stern John was up and he could not reach the ball. John is Dwight Yorke's partner in the Trinidad and Tobago team; Manchester United got the right player. Only the 18-year-old David Prutton wide on the right demonstrated anything like the vision and passing associated with Forest sides of yore. </p> <p>Gradually Charlton got into their rhythm, with their admirable captain Mark Kinsella establishing control of midfield. The difference in cohesion between them and Forest became clear. </p> <p>Forest should have seen the signs when Jim Brennan missed John Robinson's cross and Dave Beasant had to save at the feet of Graham Stuart. Then Colin Calderwood and Jon Olav Kjelde allowed a deep, low free-kick by Steve Brown to penetrate their defence and Hunt nipped in to tuck away his twenty-fourth goal of the season. </p> <p>The goal served to sting Forest for the second half and, with Jack Lester replacing John, there was a more direct, livelier look to them.

      "bodyText": "The paradise of the Premiership is postponed for Charlton Athletic. Results elsewhere meant that victory yesterday, one which looked theirs for so long, would have sent them up but instead a late, dubious penalty denied them all three points. They now look set to confirm their return after just a season's absence on Friday night at home to Huddersfield. Though never at their fluent best, Alan Curbishley's side took a lead through Andy Hunt but, to David Platt's relief, in a frantic finale his Forest team grabbed a precious point in their relegation struggle thanks to Chris Bart-Williams's penalty. Experienced manager vs rookie; even if the result does not tell the story, the league table does not lie. Charlton's fans were in party mood from the moment the 78 coaches ferrying their number up the M1 - the cost paid by a generous and grateful club - left London in the morning. They spilled round from one end of the City Ground into a stand, their yellow replica shirts providing a colourful backdrop. Their players' initial response hardly reflected the spectacle, however. Indeed there seemed to be a nervousness to them. They were fortunate that Forest, despite a 3-0 win at Crewe last week, were still short of confidence after a previous run of two points from five games. Too often Forest were strung out, relying on individual moments and leaving things to each other rather than supporting the player with the ball. When Marlon Harewood crossed from the left, only Stern John was up and he could not reach the ball. John is Dwight Yorke's partner in the Trinidad and Tobago team; Manchester United got the right player. Only the 18-year-old David Prutton wide on the right demonstrated anything like the vision and passing associated with Forest sides of yore. Gradually Charlton got into their rhythm, with their admirable captain Mark Kinsella establishing control of midfield. The difference in cohesion between them and Forest became clear. Forest should have seen the signs when Jim Brennan missed John Robinson's cross and Dave Beasant had to save at the feet of Graham Stuart. Then Colin Calderwood and Jon Olav Kjelde allowed a deep, low free-kick by Steve Brown to penetrate their defence and Hunt nipped in to tuck away his twenty-fourth goal of the season. The goal served to sting Forest for the second half and, with Jack Lester replacing John, there was a more direct, livelier look to them. Goalkeeper Dean Kiely had to be alert to block Lester's close-range shot after Calderwood had headed down Prutton's free kick. Charlton broke out and might have sealed the game when Anthony Barness found Hunt in space but this time he shot wide. And when Calderwood was dismissed for a second yellow card after a late tackle on Martin Pringle, it seemed that Charlton's victory was secure.Then came Forest's break. Brennan played a one-two with Alan Rogers and turned into Barness going for the return - penalty, said Mr Laws the referee and Bart-Williams side-footed home to rescue a barely deserved point.",

      "body": "<p>She was the crusading journalist who took on the most dangerous opposition around: the drug barons of Dublin. Now the film version of Veronica Guerin's life story is walking the same perilous path.</p> <p>When the Sky Falls, which stars the previously Oscar-nominated American actress Joan Allen as Guerin, will be released in June and is sparking fresh argument about the circumstances surrounding her assassination in 1996. </p> <p>At each stage of production, the screenplay has been vetted by lawyers to ensure it does not interfere with the trial, in October, of John Gilligan, who is accused of ordering Guerin's death. </p> <p>During filming, the director and crew worked under the protection of bodyguards and, perhaps most problematic, the writers had to pick their way through contradictory accounts of Guerin's unusual investigative methods. </p> <p>The final screenplay is based on an original story drafted by Guerin with a former colleague on Ireland's Sunday Independent, Michael Sheridan. All the names have been changed, as Guerin requested, but the plot closely follows her final, fatal investigation. </p> <p>'I suppose you could say that we changed the facts in order to be as true as possible to the facts,' said Colum McCann, the screenwriter and novelist who worked on the final script. 'But the film is true to the spirit of Veronica Guerin, warts and all.' </p> <p>It is this claim that is worrying Guerin's family and friends in Dublin. They are suspicious of the industry that is growing up around her legend. </p> <p>'I was very surprised to hear that Veronica had anything to do with the film,' said her brother Jimmy. 'I have read the Sheridan book and there were an awful lot of inaccuracies.' </p> <p>He is upset about the film showing Guerin, or Sinead Hamilton, as she is called in it, taking along her son, whose name in the movie is Colum, when she meets dangerous contacts in the underworld. This is based on a critical book by fellow Irish journalist, Emily O'Reilly. </p> <p>'I don't think she would have ever taken chances like that with her own son, Cathal,' he said. </p> <p>His concerns are shared by Guerin's old friend Paddy Prendiville, of the Irish satirical magazine, The Phoenix. </p> <p>'She may once have left Cathal in the car when she visited a man who had been accused of killing his wife, but that is very different to taking him to gangland meetings. </p> <p>'Sheridan has conceded that he only knew Veronica for a year, and she certainly never mentioned him to me,' he said.

      "bodyText": "She was the crusading journalist who took on the most dangerous opposition around: the drug barons of Dublin. Now the film version of Veronica Guerin's life story is walking the same perilous path. When the Sky Falls, which stars the previously Oscar-nominated American actress Joan Allen as Guerin, will be released in June and is sparking fresh argument about the circumstances surrounding her assassination in 1996. At each stage of production, the screenplay has been vetted by lawyers to ensure it does not interfere with the trial, in October, of John Gilligan, who is accused of ordering Guerin's death. During filming, the director and crew worked under the protection of bodyguards and, perhaps most problematic, the writers had to pick their way through contradictory accounts of Guerin's unusual investigative methods. The final screenplay is based on an original story drafted by Guerin with a former colleague on Ireland's Sunday Independent, Michael Sheridan. All the names have been changed, as Guerin requested, but the plot closely follows her final, fatal investigation. 'I suppose you could say that we changed the facts in order to be as true as possible to the facts,' said Colum McCann, the screenwriter and novelist who worked on the final script. 'But the film is true to the spirit of Veronica Guerin, warts and all.' It is this claim that is worrying Guerin's family and friends in Dublin. They are suspicious of the industry that is growing up around her legend. 'I was very surprised to hear that Veronica had anything to do with the film,' said her brother Jimmy. 'I have read the Sheridan book and there were an awful lot of inaccuracies.' He is upset about the film showing Guerin, or Sinead Hamilton, as she is called in it, taking along her son, whose name in the movie is Colum, when she meets dangerous contacts in the underworld. This is based on a critical book by fellow Irish journalist, Emily O'Reilly. 'I don't think she would have ever taken chances like that with her own son, Cathal,' he said. His concerns are shared by Guerin's old friend Paddy Prendiville, of the Irish satirical magazine, The Phoenix. 'She may once have left Cathal in the car when she visited a man who had been accused of killing his wife, but that is very different to taking him to gangland meetings. 'Sheridan has conceded that he only knew Veronica for a year, and she certainly never mentioned him to me,' he said. 'It is all a little parasitic. She was not Joan of Arc, after all, although she was an extraordinary person.' But John Mackenzie, director of the film, defended its view of Guerin's maverick behaviour. 'I wanted to do a story about journalism and I wanted a strong character,' said the British director, whose critically-acclaimed gangland film The Long Good Friday is re-released next month. 'Journalism is something that has got to be examined from all angles and this story also gave me a chance to show the Dublin of the 1990s. 'When it comes to her taking her son with her, I understand that sometimes she was stuck and so we show that, but it is a crusading film, I hope. 'As a result of her death there was a real crackdown on the drugs barons. Until that point they had the view that it did not matter because they were all simply killing each other.' The film dramatises Guerin's covert dealings with treacherous contacts in the drugs world and shows the attack in her home which left her with a bullet in the knee. The plot also shows the journalist's stressful relationship with her husband and child. 'We needed the tension between the characters,' said Mackenzie. The film has been pro duced by Irish Screen and the former BBC drama producer Michael Wearing, against a background of dramatic arrests and convictions in the murder case. In September 1998 Brian Meehan lost his battle against extradition and was convicted of driving the motorbike whose passenger shot Guerin, 36, as she waited at traffic lights. He is serving 12 years. Another Dublin man, Paul Ward, has been convicted of the murder, while a third man, John Gilligan, lost his battle against extradition from Britain last year.

      "body": "<p> Golfers know better than anyone that life isn't fair. A bad bounce or a gust of wind can send the steadiest of shots into unexpected trouble. The calmest of temperaments are regularly put to the test. Last October I watched in awe as Jim Feeney, the mild-mannered general manager of the Great Southern Hotel at Parknasilla, was taken to the limit. On the seventh green, he had a putt of less than two feet to win the hole. His gentle stroke lipped the right edge of the cup before rolling slowly but inexorably down the green, coming to rest 50 feet away. </p> <p>He stood perplexed for several seconds - and burst out laughing. Feeney did have the advantage of being a local. He had played on these fickle greens before. I had been warned that the slopes on some of the Ring of Kerry greens were so steep that crampons would be more useful than golfing spikes. In fact when I played the course, work had already begun to rebuild the eleventh green and six more - including the infamous seventh - were relaid over the winter. This notoriety had got the course widely talked about in its first full season - not bad for business. </p> <p>The Ring of Kerry has been sculpted out of a barren patch of ground on a hill with an arresting view of the wooded islands of Kenmare Bay and the brown hills of the Beare peninsula beyond. The fairways and greens, built on a base of imported sand, had drained well after a night of rain. The course was designed by Ireland's leading golf architect, Eddie Hackett, who sadly died before it was completed. The talk at the nineteenth hole is that his successors were carried away with the notion of creating greens as challenging as those faced this weekend by the world's leading golfers in the Masters at Augusta, Georgia. </p> <p>Our match went all the way to the eighteenth green, a par three with a drive that has to carry a lake to hold another steep green. Feeney had lost heart by then, but his partner John Lahiffe was well placed in the rough on the left of the putting surface while I punched a low three-iron into the wind. It wasn't what I meant to do but it worked and my ball clung on to the fringe rough on the right. Lahiffe's soft chip seemed well-judged as it rolled towards the pin but it failed to stop and finished down beside the lake. I managed to keep my ball on the green to take the match. </p> <p>It will be of no comfort to my opponents that the eighteenth green has been relaid with fewer undulations. But the lake has been extended to make the drive tougher. That's the type of trade-off that golfers learn to expect. </p> <p>The Ring of Kerry is a classic example of the new generation of golf courses where architects summon earth-moving equipment to carve their fairways and create artificial lakes in unnerving positions. The following day I drove down the Kerry coast to play at Waterville, another example of Eddie Hackett's design but this time in traditional style. Nature is the main force in shaping these 'links' on seaside land with the wind carving valleys between the dunes. </p> <p> St Andrew's, the home of golf and host to this year's Open Championship, may be the oldest and best known but leading American golfers such as Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara come to Waterville in the week before the Open to adjust their games to the peculiar demands of the links game. </p> <p>Stand on the seventeenth tee at Waterville, the highest point of the course, and you can see the 18 holes laid out before you on a spit of land between the Atlantic and Lough Currane. It was on this dune that Irish-American Jack Mulcahy had the vision in the early Seventies to transform a nineteenth-century nine-hole links into one of the longest and most testing champi onship courses in Europe.We teed off on a moist day with a mist still blowing in off the sea. Everything that could go wrong did. The wind freshened, blowing away the mist but bringing instead sharp bursts of rain. The greens had been spiked to aerate them for the winter: good for the course but bad for putting. My game collapsed, an inevitable occurence after a good round the previous day. And yet I recall the round with undiluted pleasure. Waterville saves its best for last with a run of demanding but satisfying challenges from the eleventh, a 500-yard par-five down a tunnel of sand-dunes. There is a blind drive over the dunes on the sixteenth to a fairway that curves round the bay. How much ground dare you steal by cutting the corner? Of course, we ended up hunting for our balls in the whispy grass. </p> <p>Then you mount the seventeenth tee, where Mulcahy's ashes were scattered, and you can again see the full glory of his creation. This is how the game should be played with a salty breeze in the face and a view of the breakers rolling on to the beach. It is moments like these that help golfers deal with the essential unfairness of life on the links. </p> <p> A round at the Ring of Kerry (353 64 42000) costs IR\u00a345 (\u00a334). Waterville (00 353 66 947 4102) is more expensive at IR\u00a375 (\u00a357).

      "body": "<p>'It's either a bushbaby or a leopard,' said Paul, the blond safari guide, who knew what he was talking about. I balanced precariously on the top of the Toyota Landcruiser as he sent a searchlight slicing throught the eerie darkness of the African bush. The powerful beam landed on scrub that exploded into brightness. Several pairs of stars seemed to have dropped down to it from the sky; the eyes of anxious animals, staring at us, the intruders. One pair, ruby-red, shone out hypnotically. </p> <p>'They're the only two animals with red eyes,' explained Paul. Maritei, a Masai warrior who wrapped his pendulous earlobes over the tops of his ears, drove us forward when a giraffe strode in slow motion out of the blackness into view, answering the question. No giraffe would go near a leopard. </p> <p>It can often be easier to see animals at night rather than day in Eselenkei conservation area, an expanse of Masai tribal land in the shadow of snow-topped Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain and the highest stand-alone mountain in the world. During the day the animals, unused to humans, hide in the thickets. At night, their reflective eyes give them away. At night every tree comes to life. </p> <p>Which was not a comforting thought for me as we drove back to the tents to sleep. We weren't protected by any wooden fences, electrified wires or rangers on watch with guns. The tents are just there, pitched in a clearing in the middle of the bush. As I lay in my bed there was nothing between me and any leopard but some canvas and a crisp white sheet. Earlier, while eating dinner, we had heard the howl of a wandering hyena. The previous night elephants had passed by, leaving nothing but droppings. This was camping al fresco, as close to African nature as you can get. </p> <p>And sometimes closer than you would wish. Paul regaled me with campfire tales about how he once took a safari on the other side of Kenya and two guests were trapped in their tent by a buffalo sleeping outside who refused to move. Buffalo - grouchy at the best of times - do not like being woken up. On another trip, people stayed up all night as lions wandered between the tents engaging in a roaring contest. 'People were a little shaken,' admitted Paul. I was grateful that Eselenkei is not as packed with animals as Kenya's more famous safari parks. </p> <p>The scarcity of lions means it is safe to walk about Eselenkei. Or so I was assured. You can wonder about and see lots of giraffe and ostrich, zebra and Thompson's gazelle, but no big cats. As we trooped up a dried-up river bed, Paul pointed out giraffe prints and piles of porcupine droppings. He told me how the river bed, with its steep sides, was the perfect location for a flash flood, where you hear the roar of trees being pulled down only seconds before a wall of water hits you. He confessed he hadn't checked the weather forecast before we left but assured me it was the wrong season for it. </p> <p>Farther along we saw a hyena lair with holes full of animal bones, and the dried out waterhole where the zebra like to roll about in the dirt. Owned by the Masai, rather than the government, Eselenkei is a private reserve. It's 70 square kilometres and we were the only guests. There's an intimacy with nature that is hard to catch in other parks, where a truck of snapping tourists will drive up alongside you as soon as you've spotted anything interesting. </p> <p>But you won't see the big animals. For that, we drove an hour down a shifting dirt track, across the parched terrain, in the direction of Kilimanjaro. The melting snow and the rain pour down the mountain to make Amboseli Park a huge oasis, a splash of year-round green in the browns of southern Kenya. Above you, wherever you are in the park, towers Kilimanjaro like a sentinel, its snow a strange sight just a hundred miles south of the Equator. The park is improbably teeming with buffalo, zebra, antelope, and wallowing hippos. </p> <p>But the elephants are the unmistakable stars of Amboseli. Small, large, and super-large, they are swarming all over the verdant park, more than a thousand of them in total. The celebrated elephantologist Cynthia Moss lives in a camp in Amboseli, dubbed the Kingdom of the Elephant. They stroll in families across the grass plains, they loll in the water ponds, they wade out to islands to sunbathe, they frolic in the marshes, Kili towering above them. Which for me was wonderful. Far more than any other safari animal, elephants have character, social complexity, and a sense of a tale to tell. Most safari animals don't actually do that much, but sit there or stand there and you think after a while, what now? </p> <p> I can stare at elephants for hours. At one point we were surrounded by around 200. Cute little ones, just a few months old, nuzzled up to their mothers; two amorous adults entwined their trunks and seemed to massage each other. Two males had a stand-off, one advancing slowly, the other backing away step by step. The lone bulls wandered about, with careworn tatty ears and tusks fractured in fighting. In Zimbabwe, where they cull elephants to control their numbers, they have learned how intelligent, social, and almost human they are. If you don't kill all the members of a family group, the survivors will turn into problem elephants. Not just distrustful of man, and vengeful, but they will warn other elephants of what man has done. Zimbabwe rangers have learned they must cull the entire family together, making sure that not one elephant escapes to cause trouble and warn others. </p> <p>Amboseli is great for tourists but it has not been as good for the Masai. The national park was carved out of their land and not only have they lost the watering rights for their cattle - except during drought - but they have received little of the tourist revenues that it brings (this ends up in the pockets of corrupt government Ministers). Until now, the Masai have sought revenge in a traditional manner: spearing wildlife. For a people proud of their warrior traditions and keen to prove their hunting skills, nothing beats killing a lion. Earn your spurs and get back at the park authorities at the same time. Amboseli is full of antelope and zebra but has virtually no big cats. But now one branch of the Masai - the Kisongo - have adopted the American adage: don't get mad, get even. The result, after years of planning and politics with the group ranch committee, the equivalent of the local council, is Eselenkei conservation area. It is a wildlife park on their land, but this time it's on their terms. It nestles up to Amboseli, in the so-called 'dispersal area', and during the rainy season much of Amboseli's wildlife saunters through. Roads have been painfully cleared by hand, using just farm tools. Waterholes have been dug to make sure the wildlife stays there once the rainy season ends. 'Water is a magnet. The animals will stay where the water is,' said Paul. </p> <p>The accommodation tents have been put up in a clearing in the middle of the conservation area. These aren't your usual camping-in-Devon tents. Indeed, they're not even the usual luxury safari tents. Put it like this: these are tents with flush toilets. They have hot showers, copper basins, wooden wardrobes, comfortable beds and solar-powered electric lights. Everything in the camp is 'low impact': take it all down and you'd never know there'd been a camp there. </p> <p>There's a mess tent and the food is cooked for you but, perhaps fortunately, it is not traditional Masai fare. I didn't need to decline politely the traditional Masai appetiser of cows' milk with fresh blood. Having milked the cows, the Masai then tap a neck vein for a pint or two of blood. (Apparantly it's a favourite with growing young men and pregnant women.) Instead, on the first night I had roast chicken and potatoes with mange-tout and on the second a Greek version of lasagne. </p> <p> I felt like a relic from colonial White Mischief days, sitting at a table in the middle of the bush, surrounded by animal sounds, sipping French red wine and eating a traditional English roast served to me by a usually semi-nomadic Masai warrior wearing his traditional red robes, covered from earlobe to ankle in multicoloured beaded jewellery, sword dangling at his side. The costumes aren't put on for the tourists: it is just the way they dress. Jeans and T-shirts have yet to make their mark. Their earlobes are hugely distended from dangling large objects in them. On their cheeks they have little circular scars where they were branded with burning rope as toddlers to ward off eye disease. </p> <p>As I tucked into roast chicken, I was almost overwhelmed by Western liberal guilt. My presence was turning a warrior into a waiter, making a proud person servile. Wouldn't contact with all the tourists on their tribal land destroy their culture? </p> <p>Such concerns were laid to rest by the remarkable Emmanuel Onetu, officially the conservation manager of Eselenkei, unofficially the cultural liaison officer, and, as he calls himself proudly, the 'community mobiliser'. He grew up in a traditional cow-dung hut, but was educated to O-level and is now chairman of the local school. He lives in a wood and corrugated steel hut and, quite startlingly in the bush, he has a telephone. He has been the driving force behind Eselenkei, working with Jake Grieves-Cook, founder of the travel company Tropical Places. </p> <p>Emmanuel has had to work hard to ensure that all 3,000 people on the group ranch understand what the project is about, and give it their support. The involvement of a white man raised suspicions that they were going to be taken advantage of, but after decades of sending tourists to Kenya, Grieves-Cook is keen to put something back in to the community. It is a joint venture between him and the Kisongo group ranch. </p> <p>The Kisongo Masai have agreed not to kill the wildlife for the sake of it. In Eselenkei there is no spearing or snaring. Emmanuel has even persuaded Masai from farther afield to cut down on the killing. 'We have all this nature and wildlife and we want to share it. We are proud of it,' said Emmanuel. 'We are learning about conservation.' </p> <p>Emmanuel talks almost messianically about the benefits of the project. The Masai get a lease fee for the conservation area, as well as a bed-night fee and an entrance fee for every tourist. There are also 26 Masai employed in the upkeep of the conservation area. It's the first paid job they have had. Emmanuel explains that it is their chance to get some of the financial benefits from tourism, to help them with the most basic things. 'We want to generate income, so we can send our children to school and pay for health care.' He showed me the local school, which has 270 pupils, many of whom have to walk three hours there and three hours back each day. They have virtually no books but plenty of enthusiasm. They want to turn the wooden classrooms into brick ones, but first they have a more critical problem: getting water. The pump at the school borehole has broken, and, of course, with no water the teachers cannot wash, or drink, or cook for themselves or the children. Revenues from Eselenkei tourists will mean that they can mend the water pump, rather than close the school. 'Without education, nothing can happen. Without education you have no future,' said Emanuel, who believes conservation is the future.</p>",

      "bodyText": "'It's either a bushbaby or a leopard,' said Paul, the blond safari guide, who knew what he was talking about. I balanced precariously on the top of the Toyota Landcruiser as he sent a searchlight slicing throught the eerie darkness of the African bush. The powerful beam landed on scrub that exploded into brightness. Several pairs of stars seemed to have dropped down to it from the sky; the eyes of anxious animals, staring at us, the intruders. One pair, ruby-red, shone out hypnotically. 'They're the only two animals with red eyes,' explained Paul. Maritei, a Masai warrior who wrapped his pendulous earlobes over the tops of his ears, drove us forward when a giraffe strode in slow motion out of the blackness into view, answering the question. No giraffe would go near a leopard. It can often be easier to see animals at night rather than day in Eselenkei conservation area, an expanse of Masai tribal land in the shadow of snow-topped Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain and the highest stand-alone mountain in the world. During the day the animals, unused to humans, hide in the thickets. At night, their reflective eyes give them away. At night every tree comes to life. Which was not a comforting thought for me as we drove back to the tents to sleep. We weren't protected by any wooden fences, electrified wires or rangers on watch with guns. The tents are just there, pitched in a clearing in the middle of the bush. As I lay in my bed there was nothing between me and any leopard but some canvas and a crisp white sheet. Earlier, while eating dinner, we had heard the howl of a wandering hyena. The previous night elephants had passed by, leaving nothing but droppings. This was camping al fresco, as close to African nature as you can get. And sometimes closer than you would wish. Paul regaled me with campfire tales about how he once took a safari on the other side of Kenya and two guests were trapped in their tent by a buffalo sleeping outside who refused to move. Buffalo - grouchy at the best of times - do not like being woken up. On another trip, people stayed up all night as lions wandered between the tents engaging in a roaring contest. 'People were a little shaken,' admitted Paul. I was grateful that Eselenkei is not as packed with animals as Kenya's more famous safari parks. The scarcity of lions means it is safe to walk about Eselenkei. Or so I was assured. You can wonder about and see lots of giraffe and ostrich, zebra and Thompson's gazelle, but no big cats. As we trooped up a dried-up river bed, Paul pointed out giraffe prints and piles of porcupine droppings. He told me how the river bed, with its steep sides, was the perfect location for a flash flood, where you hear the roar of trees being pulled down only seconds before a wall of water hits you. He confessed he hadn't checked the weather forecast before we left but assured me it was the wrong season for it. Farther along we saw a hyena lair with holes full of animal bones, and the dried out waterhole where the zebra like to roll about in the dirt. Owned by the Masai, rather than the government, Eselenkei is a private reserve. It's 70 square kilometres and we were the only guests. There's an intimacy with nature that is hard to catch in other parks, where a truck of snapping tourists will drive up alongside you as soon as you've spotted anything interesting. But you won't see the big animals. For that, we drove an hour down a shifting dirt track, across the parched terrain, in the direction of Kilimanjaro. The melting snow and the rain pour down the mountain to make Amboseli Park a huge oasis, a splash of year-round green in the browns of southern Kenya. Above you, wherever you are in the park, towers Kilimanjaro like a sentinel, its snow a strange sight just a hundred miles south of the Equator. The park is improbably teeming with buffalo, zebra, antelope, and wallowing hippos. But the elephants are the unmistakable stars of Amboseli. Small, large, and super-large, they are swarming all over the verdant park, more than a thousand of them in total. The celebrated elephantologist Cynthia Moss lives in a camp in Amboseli, dubbed the Kingdom of the Elephant. They stroll in families across the grass plains, they loll in the water ponds, they wade out to islands to sunbathe, they frolic in the marshes, Kili towering above them. Which for me was wonderful. Far more than any other safari animal, elephants have character, social complexity, and a sense of a tale to tell. Most safari animals don't actually do that much, but sit there or stand there and you think after a while, what now? I can stare at elephants for hours. At one point we were surrounded by around 200. Cute little ones, just a few months old, nuzzled up to their mothers; two amorous adults entwined their trunks and seemed to massage each other. Two males had a stand-off, one advancing slowly, the other backing away step by step. The lone bulls wandered about, with careworn tatty ears and tusks fractured in fighting. In Zimbabwe, where they cull elephants to control their numbers, they have learned how intelligent, social, and almost human they are. If you don't kill all the members of a family group, the survivors will turn into problem elephants. Not just distrustful of man, and vengeful, but they will warn other elephants of what man has done. Zimbabwe rangers have learned they must cull the entire family together, making sure that not one elephant escapes to cause trouble and warn others. Amboseli is great for tourists but it has not been as good for the Masai. The national park was carved out of their land and not only have they lost the watering rights for their cattle - except during drought - but they have received little of the tourist revenues that it brings (this ends up in the pockets of corrupt government Ministers). Until now, the Masai have sought revenge in a traditional manner: spearing wildlife. For a people proud of their warrior traditions and keen to prove their hunting skills, nothing beats killing a lion. Earn your spurs and get back at the park authorities at the same time. Amboseli is full of antelope and zebra but has virtually no big cats. But now one branch of the Masai - the Kisongo - have adopted the American adage: don't get mad, get even. The result, after years of planning and politics with the group ranch committee, the equivalent of the local council, is Eselenkei conservation area. It is a wildlife park on their land, but this time it's on their terms. It nestles up to Amboseli, in the so-called 'dispersal area', and during the rainy season much of Amboseli's wildlife saunters through. Roads have been painfully cleared by hand, using just farm tools. Waterholes have been dug to make sure the wildlife stays there once the rainy season ends. 'Water is a magnet. The animals will stay where the water is,' said Paul. The accommodation tents have been put up in a clearing in the middle of the conservation area. These aren't your usual camping-in-Devon tents. Indeed, they're not even the usual luxury safari tents. Put it like this: these are tents with flush toilets. They have hot showers, copper basins, wooden wardrobes, comfortable beds and solar-powered electric lights. Everything in the camp is 'low impact': take it all down and you'd never know there'd been a camp there. There's a mess tent and the food is cooked for you but, perhaps fortunately, it is not traditional Masai fare. I didn't need to decline politely the traditional Masai appetiser of cows' milk with fresh blood. Having milked the cows, the Masai then tap a neck vein for a pint or two of blood. (Apparantly it's a favourite with growing young men and pregnant women.) Instead, on the first night I had roast chicken and potatoes with mange-tout and on the second a Greek version of lasagne. I felt like a relic from colonial White Mischief days, sitting at a table in the middle of the bush, surrounded by animal sounds, sipping French red wine and eating a traditional English roast served to me by a usually semi-nomadic Masai warrior wearing his traditional red robes, covered from earlobe to ankle in multicoloured beaded jewellery, sword dangling at his side. The costumes aren't put on for the tourists: it is just the way they dress. Jeans and T-shirts have yet to make their mark. Their earlobes are hugely distended from dangling large objects in them. On their cheeks they have little circular scars where they were branded with burning rope as toddlers to ward off eye disease. As I tucked into roast chicken, I was almost overwhelmed by Western liberal guilt. My presence was turning a warrior into a waiter, making a proud person servile. Wouldn't contact with all the tourists on their tribal land destroy their culture? Such concerns were laid to rest by the remarkable Emmanuel Onetu, officially the conservation manager of Eselenkei, unofficially the cultural liaison officer, and, as he calls himself proudly, the 'community mobiliser'. He grew up in a traditional cow-dung hut, but was educated to O-level and is now chairman of the local school. He lives in a wood and corrugated steel hut and, quite startlingly in the bush, he has a telephone. He has been the driving force behind Eselenkei, working with Jake Grieves-Cook, founder of the travel company Tropical Places. Emmanuel has had to work hard to ensure that all 3,000 people on the group ranch understand what the project is about, and give it their support. The involvement of a white man raised suspicions that they were going to be taken advantage of, but after decades of sending tourists to Kenya, Grieves-Cook is keen to put something back in to the community. It is a joint venture between him and the Kisongo group ranch. The Kisongo Masai have agreed not to kill the wildlife for the sake of it. In Eselenkei there is no spearing or snaring. Emmanuel has even persuaded Masai from farther afield to cut down on the killing. 'We have all this nature and wildlife and we want to share it. We are proud of it,' said Emmanuel. 'We are learning about conservation.' Emmanuel talks almost messianically about the benefits of the project. The Masai get a lease fee for the conservation area, as well as a bed-night fee and an entrance fee for every tourist. There are also 26 Masai employed in the upkeep of the conservation area. It's the first paid job they have had. Emmanuel explains that it is their chance to get some of the financial benefits from tourism, to help them with the most basic things. 'We want to generate income, so we can send our children to school and pay for health care.' He showed me the local school, which has 270 pupils, many of whom have to walk three hours there and three hours back each day. They have virtually no books but plenty of enthusiasm. They want to turn the wooden classrooms into brick ones, but first they have a more critical problem: getting water. The pump at the school borehole has broken, and, of course, with no water the teachers cannot wash, or drink, or cook for themselves or the children. Revenues from Eselenkei tourists will mean that they can mend the water pump, rather than close the school. 'Without education, nothing can happen. Without education you have no future,' said Emanuel, who believes conservation is the future.",

      "body": "<p>The auction of TV rights to top-flight football used to be a sedate affair - ITV vs BBC, one match a week, if that, plus highlights. It was the kind of negotiating round which could be started and finished in one day in a smoke-filled room. </p> <p>The meeting last Monday of Premier League chiefs to decide the structure of the new rights package showed not only how fiendishly complicated this process has become, but that the bidding which ensues will determine the corporate future of the UK's biggest broadcasters. </p> <p>The cup-tie pits pay TV company BSkyB against the terrestrial broadcasters, with the prospect of Bill Gates and his pals in the cable industry ready to come off the subs bench to add to the tension. The billion-pound question is whether Sky can hang on to the exclusive live contract which, a decade ago, transformed it from a \u00a35 million a week loss-maker into Europe's most profitable broadcaster. </p> <p>With the pressures of going digital eroding Sky's profits to zero, can it afford to hang on to the lion's share of live football? More importantly, can it afford to lose it? One of the first challenges to break cover comes from the increasingly confident ITV Network. ITV plans to become the first terrestrial television channel to show Premiership matches live if a joint bid with ONdigital for the next three-year contract is successful. This revives the prospect of the first ever live Premiership matches on free to air TV - remember the Premiership only started in 1992, when Sky bagged the contract. </p> <p>There have been no public announcements of broadcasters teaming up to bid for the packages that the League is offering through its tender document, which went out on Friday, but it is an open secret that various liaisons are being struck to defray costs and bring a range of platforms within the bounds of one operation. </p> <p>ITV and ONdigital are perhaps the most natural pairing of all given that ONdigital is owned by two of ITV's major players, Carlton and Granada, and that they already successfully share coverage of the European Champions League. </p> <p>It would make perfect sense for them to extend this collaboration to the main collective package being offered by the Premier League - the 66 matches to be shown live mainly at 4pm on Sundays and 8pm on Mondays. This would replace the 60 matches per season package that the League sold to Sky soon after the Premiership's formation and again in 1996 when the current contract was negotiated. </p> <p>'ITV's ideal would be to get one match a week so it could be scheduled in a regular slot,' says one insider, who confirms that at the very least ITV and ONdigital have been discussing a joint bid. 'It would also be good for ONdigital because its coverage could then be cross-promoted on ITV.' </p> <p>A bonding of ITV and ONdigital might also be a neat solution for those Premiership clubs, notably Arsenal and its vice chairman David Dein, who have floated the idea of some live games being sold to a terrestrial broadcaster. </p> <p>Dein has circulated other clubs with his thoughts, upsetting the notoriously upsettable Chelsea chairman Ken Bates, who says that showing matches on terrestrial television would bring down attendances, as happened when ITV showed the old First Division - but then 10 per cent of Bates's club is in the hands of - you've guessed it - Sky TV, so perhaps he would say that, wouldn't he? </p> <p>However, one close observer of the process that the League hopes to complete by June (there is a 10 May deadline for bids to be in) is sceptical about free-to-air's chances. 'I know a number of clubs want some terrestrial live exposure,' he says, 'but you wonder how serious they'll be when this dilutes the overall amount of money they'll get from non-terrestrial. They are all very holier than thou until the cheque arrives.' </p> <p>This may strengthen Sky's hand as it bids energetically to maintain its monopoly of live coverage of the Premiership on its subscription service. In 1992, Rupert Mur doch paid the major share of a ground-breaking \u00a3304m deal to secure the first five years of Premiership coverage (the BBC put \u00a34.5m per season towards this amount for Match of the Day highlights). When the deal was renegotiated in 1996, this time for four seasons, Sky had to find \u00a3670m and now the highlights cost the Beeb \u00a318.25m per season. </p> <p>In 2000, the winning bid for 66 matches per season over three seasons is expected to be in the region of \u00a31 billion - or \u00a35m a match - with Sky's main opposition coming from the ITV/ONdigital consortium and the American cable giant NTL, whose bid is now being strongly linked with Channel 4, and whose shareholders include France Telecom and Bill Gates's Microsoft. </p> <p>The ability of Sky, ONdigital and NTL to bid any more vigorously will be constrained by their desire also to be involved in bidding for the 40 pay-per-view matches that are being offered for each of the three seasons by the League. Monday's meeting of the clubs to finalise the tender document spent more time discussing pay-per-view than any other aspect of the new deal because no one was sure how it should be introduced, particularly as other European leagues and clubs have not found it the unqualified success they expected. </p> <p>To start with, at least, the Premiership's ppv matches, to be shown early on Sunday afternoons, will be decided after whoever has the 66 games has cherry-picked the best fixtures. </p> <p>Even so, the package has aroused considerable interest among broadcasters, with the obvious bidders likely to be joined by Front Row, the NTL/Telewest-owned company that shows ppv movies on cable, and u&gt;direct, the country's leading independent ppv broadcaster whose boss, Richard Brooke, formerly of Sky, last week announced a deal to show live international cricket from next month. </p> <p>Three other deals - for highlights, overseas and Internet rights - should push the amount that the League reaps close to the \u00a32bn predicted by some City analysts. If this is true, there will almost certainly be some casualities in the TV sector as this is not a sustainable price for a relatively small market like the UK to pay for one set of rights. </p> <p>Highlights will either attract fierce competition from the terrestrial broadcasters or see the formation of some unlikely unions. 'There could be some partnerships you would never believe,' says one TV executive. 'You could see cats and dogs living together in this deal.' Cue the BBC and ITV bidding together for delayed rights with the Beeb keeping Match of the Day on Saturdays and ITV landing the new Sunday evening highlights? </p> <p>At the moment, though, the BBC's intentions are unknown as Greg Dyke is only now turning his attention towards football. He has called a meeting for tomorrow to decide how the Beeb bids, for what, how much and with whom. </p> <p>The full impact of the Internet is still a little way off but this is unlikely to rule out some hefty bids given its huge revenue potential. </p> <p>As one analyst put it: 'They will be paying a price for entry into the market and for the impact it is likely to have on their stock position.' </p> <p>Let the madness begin.</p>",

With the pressures of going digital eroding Sky's profits to zero, can it afford to hang on to the lion's share of live football? More importantly, can it afford to lose it? One of the first challenges to break cover comes from the increasingly confident ITV Network. ITV plans to become the first terrestrial television channel to show Premiership matches live if a joint bid with ONdigital for the next three-year contract is successful. This revives the prospect of the first ever live Premiership matches on free to air TV - remember the Premiership only started in 1992, when Sky bagged the contract. There have been no public announcements of broadcasters teaming up to bid for the packages that the League is offering through its tender document, which went out on Friday, but it is an open secret that various liaisons are being struck to defray costs and bring a range of platforms within the bounds of one operation. ITV and ONdigital are perhaps the most natural pairing of all given that ONdigital is owned by two of ITV's major players, Carlton and Granada, and that they already successfully share coverage of the European Champions League. It would make perfect sense for them to extend this collaboration to the main collective package being offered by the Premier League - the 66 matches to be shown live mainly at 4pm on Sundays and 8pm on Mondays. This would replace the 60 matches per season package that the League sold to Sky soon after the Premiership's formation and again in 1996 when the current contract was negotiated. 'ITV's ideal would be to get one match a week so it could be scheduled in a regular slot,' says one insider, who confirms that at the very least ITV and ONdigital have been discussing a joint bid. 'It would also be good for ONdigital because its coverage could then be cross-promoted on ITV.' A bonding of ITV and ONdigital might also be a neat solution for those Premiership clubs, notably Arsenal and its vice chairman David Dein, who have floated the idea of some live games being sold to a terrestrial broadcaster. Dein has circulated other clubs with his thoughts, upsetting the notoriously upsettable Chelsea chairman Ken Bates, who says that showing matches on terrestrial television would bring down attendances, as happened when ITV showed the old First Division - but then 10 per cent of Bates's club is in the hands of - you've guessed it - Sky TV, so perhaps he would say that, wouldn't he? However, one close observer of the process that the League hopes to complete by June (there is a 10 May deadline for bids to be in) is sceptical about free-to-air's chances. 'I know a number of clubs want some terrestrial live exposure,' he says, 'but you wonder how serious they'll be when this dilutes the overall amount of money they'll get from non-terrestrial. They are all very holier than thou until the cheque arrives.' This may strengthen Sky's hand as it bids energetically to maintain its monopoly of live coverage of the Premiership on its subscription service. In 1992, Rupert Mur doch paid the major share of a ground-breaking \u00a3304m deal to secure the first five years of Premiership coverage (the BBC put \u00a34.5m per season towards this amount for Match of the Day highlights). When the deal was renegotiated in 1996, this time for four seasons, Sky had to find \u00a3670m and now the highlights cost the Beeb \u00a318.25m per season. In 2000, the winning bid for 66 matches per season over three seasons is expected to be in the region of \u00a31 billion - or \u00a35m a match - with Sky's main opposition coming from the ITV/ONdigital consortium and the American cable giant NTL, whose bid is now being strongly linked with Channel 4, and whose shareholders include France Telecom and Bill Gates's Microsoft. The ability of Sky, ONdigital and NTL to bid any more vigorously will be constrained by their desire also to be involved in bidding for the 40 pay-per-view matches that are being offered for each of the three seasons by the League. Monday's meeting of the clubs to finalise the tender document spent more time discussing pay-per-view than any other aspect of the new deal because no one was sure how it should be introduced, particularly as other European leagues and clubs have not found it the unqualified success they expected. To start with, at least, the Premiership's ppv matches, to be shown early on Sunday afternoons, will be decided after whoever has the 66 games has cherry-picked the best fixtures. Even so, the package has aroused considerable interest among broadcasters, with the obvious bidders likely to be joined by Front Row, the NTL/Telewest-owned company that shows ppv movies on cable, and u&gt;direct, the country's leading independent ppv broadcaster whose boss, Richard Brooke, formerly of Sky, last week announced a deal to show live international cricket from next month. Three other deals - for highlights, overseas and Internet rights - should push the amount that the League reaps close to the \u00a32bn predicted by some City analysts. If this is true, there will almost certainly be some casualities in the TV sector as this is not a sustainable price for a relatively small market like the UK to pay for one set of rights. Highlights will either attract fierce competition from the terrestrial broadcasters or see the formation of some unlikely unions. 'There could be some partnerships you would never believe,' says one TV executive. 'You could see cats and dogs living together in this deal.' Cue the BBC and ITV bidding together for delayed rights with the Beeb keeping Match of the Day on Saturdays and ITV landing the new Sunday evening highlights? At the moment, though, the BBC's intentions are unknown as Greg Dyke is only now turning his attention towards football. He has called a meeting for tomorrow to decide how the Beeb bids, for what, how much and with whom. The full impact of the Internet is still a little way off but this is unlikely to rule out some hefty bids given its huge revenue potential. As one analyst put it: 'They will be paying a price for entry into the market and for the impact it is likely to have on their stock position.' Let the madness begin.",

      "byline": "Philip French",

      "body": "<p>What have Norma Rae, Karen Silkwood, Marie Ragghianti and Ellen Brockovich got in common? They're all real-life American women who have given their names to movies about tough, working-class single mothers confronting big corporations and politicians in a man's world that has abused and exploited them. </p> <p>They are also roles that have afforded Oscar-winners or future Oscar winners - Sally Field, Meryl Streep, Sissie Spacek - the chance to raise their hemlines, lower their necklines, put their hands on their hips and give the world a piece of their mind. In so doing, they strike a blow for the likes of Gennifer Flowers and Paula Jones, giving the too easily dismissed and joked-about trailer-trash their day in court. </p> <p>Following Out of Sight and The Limey, Erin Brockovich is Steven Soderbergh's third impressive film in the past two years. It has a sparkling script by Susannah Grant, is superbly photographed by Ed Lachman and gracefully edited by Anne V. Coates. But the movie is dominated by Julia Roberts as Erin. She is in every scene and it's her response to events, her personal growth and (to use the current term) empowerment that we observe. </p> <p>As a teenager, Erin was a beauty queen, Miss Wichita, Kansas. Now in her early thirties, with two broken marriages, three children and no qualifications, she's all attitude, aggression and unfocused energy. Living in a dispiriting LA suburb, she dresses like a costume designer's idea of a tart or a country singer and has a line in feisty talk that borders on Tourette's syndrome. </p> <p>We first meet her failing to get a job as a medical secretary (she'd wanted to be a doctor, but early marriage got in the way, she says), after which she's the innocent party in a crash, hit at an intersection by a Jaguar. A middle-aged lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), takes on her surefire case, which she loses by offending a middle-class jury with her comment on the defendant: 'That asshole smashed in my fucking neck.' </p> <p>Desperate for a job (a marvellous montage has her vainly answering a dozen ads in the Los Angeles Times), she virtually blackmails the amiable Ed into giving her a temporary research job in his law office. </p> <p>Ed's largely female staff are shocked by her clothes and forthright language and it's to the film's credit that her fellow employees never get to find her endearing. But she takes to the work and stumbles across a pro bono case the firm isn't taking seriously, the purchase of some property in a dismal inland township of Hinkley by the massive Pacific Gas and Electricity corporation. </p> <p>Why does PG&amp;E want the land? Why have they paid medical bills for the owners? Erin has unearthed a scandalous case of corporate malfeasance by which toxic chromium has been entering the local water for 30 years, bringing sickness and death to more than 400 families. </p> <p>Gradually, this becomes Erin's crusade, her chance to do something with her life, to achieve self-respect and gain the respect of others. Her seductive manner helps her gather evidence.

      "bodyText": "What have Norma Rae, Karen Silkwood, Marie Ragghianti and Ellen Brockovich got in common? They're all real-life American women who have given their names to movies about tough, working-class single mothers confronting big corporations and politicians in a man's world that has abused and exploited them. They are also roles that have afforded Oscar-winners or future Oscar winners - Sally Field, Meryl Streep, Sissie Spacek - the chance to raise their hemlines, lower their necklines, put their hands on their hips and give the world a piece of their mind. In so doing, they strike a blow for the likes of Gennifer Flowers and Paula Jones, giving the too easily dismissed and joked-about trailer-trash their day in court. Following Out of Sight and The Limey, Erin Brockovich is Steven Soderbergh's third impressive film in the past two years. It has a sparkling script by Susannah Grant, is superbly photographed by Ed Lachman and gracefully edited by Anne V. Coates. But the movie is dominated by Julia Roberts as Erin. She is in every scene and it's her response to events, her personal growth and (to use the current term) empowerment that we observe. As a teenager, Erin was a beauty queen, Miss Wichita, Kansas. Now in her early thirties, with two broken marriages, three children and no qualifications, she's all attitude, aggression and unfocused energy. Living in a dispiriting LA suburb, she dresses like a costume designer's idea of a tart or a country singer and has a line in feisty talk that borders on Tourette's syndrome. We first meet her failing to get a job as a medical secretary (she'd wanted to be a doctor, but early marriage got in the way, she says), after which she's the innocent party in a crash, hit at an intersection by a Jaguar. A middle-aged lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), takes on her surefire case, which she loses by offending a middle-class jury with her comment on the defendant: 'That asshole smashed in my fucking neck.' Desperate for a job (a marvellous montage has her vainly answering a dozen ads in the Los Angeles Times), she virtually blackmails the amiable Ed into giving her a temporary research job in his law office. Ed's largely female staff are shocked by her clothes and forthright language and it's to the film's credit that her fellow employees never get to find her endearing. But she takes to the work and stumbles across a pro bono case the firm isn't taking seriously, the purchase of some property in a dismal inland township of Hinkley by the massive Pacific Gas and Electricity corporation. Why does PG&amp;E want the land? Why have they paid medical bills for the owners? Erin has unearthed a scandalous case of corporate malfeasance by which toxic chromium has been entering the local water for 30 years, bringing sickness and death to more than 400 families. Gradually, this becomes Erin's crusade, her chance to do something with her life, to achieve self-respect and gain the respect of others. Her seductive manner helps her gather evidence. Her compassion, and the very fact that she isn't a lawyer, helps win the confidence of the cheated working-class community and thus lay the grounds for a class action that leads to a $333 million settlement, the greatest in American legal history. The film wisely relies on observing its heroine's progress in the pursuit of justice and never tries to be a thriller, though the producers can't resist that legal equivalent of the last-minute touchdown - the vital evidence discovered the night before the trial. Erin receives one mildly threatening phone call, is chased by a pair of fairly ordinary looking security guards while trespassing on PG&amp;E land and has three laugh-provoking encounters with the high-priced corporate lawyers that she wins hands down. This is a triumphalist story without the complexity and darkness of Michael Mann's The Insider or the bleak view of the legal profession that A Civil Action provides. Her boss, played by Finney as a decent, plodding liberal realist, is the acceptable face of the law and Erin's efforts brought the firm more than $100m and herself a $2m bonus. The movie does, however, show something of the price Erin paid for her dedication - the neglect of her kids (the consequences in real life were more serious than the film implies) and the estrangement of her lover, a kindly biker (Aaron Eckhart) who looks after her children. This neighbour, whom Erin initially misjudges in the way other people misread her, represents the rejection of the very social involvement that has become her road to salvation.",

      "body": "<p>Colin Firth! Mr Darcy! You cannot mention one of these names without the other following immediately. Both have been changed immeasurably, in the public eye, by their relationship with the other. Before the Firth treatment, Mr Darcy was seen as a dour, mildly unpleasant, if misunderstood character in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Before he was Darcy, Colin Firth was a tall, well-built English actor with an expressive face and a string of smouldering, half-forgotten characters behind him. He'd been Robert Lawrence, the wounded Falklands veteran; he'd been Valmont in the Milos Forman film of the same name; he'd been a nutcase in a Ruth Rendell crime drama. And then, in 1994, he was cast as Mr Darcy. </p> <p>What was so special about Mr Darcy? Women loved him. For a great part of the BBC's version in the story, he hung around in the background, not saying much. Firth did a lot of his acting with his eyes. Other characters talked a great deal about him while he was absent. Unlike a lot of male heroes, he was a mystery. He was in no way a feminised wimp. Late in the day, burning with passion and unfulfilled sexual desire, he jumped off his horse into a pond and emerged, his shirt dripping. What people remember is those mutton-chop sideburns flying through the air. For the entire Bridget Jones generation, this was a superb antidote to the dull, whining, noncommittal New Man of the 90s - and he didn't drink lager and go on about football all the time. </p> <p>Since then, Firth has become part of the zeitgeist. He has entered the language. After Darcy, of course, he was playing a 90s football fan - the Nick Hornby character in Fever Pitch. Next, rumour has it, he will play Mark Darcy in the film version of Bridget Jones's Diary. The official status of the rumour, according to a spokesperson from Working Title, the film's production company, is 'unconfirmed'. Still, it's pretty exciting. Bridget has already interviewed a fictional version of Firth himself in the second Bridget Jones book, The Edge of Reason. In the world of Colin Firth, art is beginning to copy art. </p> <p>At the moment of Darcy, Firth, who was 34, was wondering how much time he had left as a romantic lead. Having accepted the part, he said, 'I don't know how much longer that sort of character will be available to me.' Afterwards, he was stunned at the way people identified him with the character. 'I felt as if I'd lost my whole personality,' he says. He tells me: 'It's been very strange, this idea of Mr Darcy appealing so much to women. Because obviously, as you can see, I don't carry that around with me. I'm not so Mr Darcy every day of my life. If people expect to see a saturnine, dark, smouldering tall aristocrat, they are going to be disappointed.' </p> <p>At rest, Firth's face is set in a sort of handsome grimace, he looks easily haunted. The mouth turns slightly down; the bones of the face cast shadows. But his expressions change with almost no effort; as an acting tool, this is a highly strung face. One slight touch on the happy pedal and he beams; an iota of misery and he glowers. 'I never saw myself as Mr Ugly, but I'm not that handsome,' he told me. 'I can sort of be made to look quite a lot better or quite a lot worse.' </p> <p> I first meet Colin Firth, now 39, on the set of Donovan Quick, a forthcoming BBC television film in which, as usual, he plays an intense, edgy fellow who hides behind a mask of English reticence. He is genial and welcoming, and speaks in that unusual, slightly old-fashioned voice which is perfect for costume drama. That's his actual voice. In person, Firth is not at all like Darcy. There is no sense of menace. Firth's character, obsessed with the tyranny of a national bus company, starts his own. Firth spends the day patiently approaching the bus, and entering the bus, and entering the bus, over and over. He takes instructions from the director, David Blair, with absolute humility. </p> <p>Before we meet again, I catch him several times on TV. He's prolific, having made more than 30 films, and you can often get a glimpse of him late at night, in a youthful guise. Sometimes he has a caddish moustache. Early Firth looked jittery and worried. The mature, smouldering Firth came later. Firth is very English; he plays people who hide their emotions. He often appears melancholic. Firth himself had an unhappy childhood. He once said: 'I'm very suspicious of people who romanticise their childhood.' </p> <p>Firth is married to Livia Guiggioli, an Italian documentary maker. Nick Hornby describes her as 'joke-perfect: PhD, beautiful in that sultry Italian way, funny and vivacious'. She is also, he says, 'very good for Firth, because she's absolutely not in any thrall to him'. She 'affects to be completely mystified' by the Mr Darcy situation. </p> <p>For three years in the 90s, Firth lived with the actress Meg Tilly, whom he fell in love with on the set of Milos Forman's Valmont. They have a son, Will, who is now nine. </p> <p>We met again, recently, in a film production office in London's West End. Again, Firth is impeccably warm and charming. He wears neutral clothes; his hair is on the short side of bouffant. Firth's hair is either quite short or quite long, never very short or very long. His characters are always outwardly respectable. He tells me he is about to go to Los Angeles to spend time with his son. He says, 'Los Angeles can actually be quite a relaxing place, but the minute you try to invest anything in it, it grabs you and starts to play games with you.' He already sounds like a character in a film. Another reason he is going to California, Firth says, is for 'my own personal relaxation, which is doing very little indeed'. </p> <p>He lived in Canada with Tilly, three hours inland from Vancouver. 'I'm too much of a lightweight for it,' he says. 'It's wilderness. Serious wilderness. It's not a trip to Wimbledon Common. And I rather fancied the quaint idea of the wilderness. It's really the middle of nowhere.' The move, he says, had been Tilly's decision. 'She found the place. I had a kind of reclusive impulse at the time, but not that reclusive. It was too wild. If you go north from where we were, there'd be nothing but woods and grizzly bears, until you get to the Arctic Circle. I found that oppressive. You couldn't even go for walks. There were instructions about going for walks. You take a flare and a map and a blanket and a bell, because within 20 minutes you can get lost by going round in circles.' </p> <p>Firth is gentlemanly, affable. With his deep, old-fashioned voice, he talks as if he were in a smoking room, holding a brandy bubble. We were quickly on to the subject of his childhood. Having been born in Africa, where his parents were teachers, he came to England at the age of four. Then, after stints in Billericay and Brentwood, the family moved to St Louis, Missouri, for a year. Firth was 12. When they came back to England, it was to another town, just outside Winchester. The young Firth felt unsettled. </p> <p>The year in America, he says, 'didn't feel like a very good thing at the time. It was probably a very good thing. I had a very bad time there.' The year abroad had done something to him. 'American kids,' he says, 'were a hell of a lot more sophisticated. I was barely out of grey shorts. I'd come out of primary school, where my classmates had grass-stained knees and collected football cards.' The American kids, on the other hand, 'were more like something out of Woodstock. I was like something out of Just William. They had slogans on their backs that were to do with the Vietnam war. I felt like a geek. I made up for it with a false cockiness. Before I got rejected, I would tell someone to fuck off. Someone would say, \"What's your name?\" and I'd say, \"Mind your own business.\"' </p> <p>This was how he started: the first serious acting he did was to pretend he was tough, when he was not. Looking at his facial expressions, at the layers of stoicism and reserve, one gets a sense of somebody deeply, quintessentially English. Firth's face was once described in The New York Times as 'strangely neutral'. Unlike Jude Law, or Ralph Fiennes, he does not easily slip into American; being in America as a child only made him more English. The English actors he likes are Albert Finney, Donald Pleasance and Sir Anthony Hopkins - men of elusive emotions and inner struggle. </p> <p>He tells me he went back to his American school in the 90s, and found, to his relief, that it was 'pretty nasty. The place was horrible and had the atmosphere of a reform school. It made me realise that it wasn't all me.' He had acted in pantomimes and school plays since the age of five. 'School plays,' he says, 'were always something where I was definitely praised and in demand; that wasn't true of most aspects of school life for me.' He wasn't the first to be picked for the football team, or particularly academic. When he was 14, he made 'an official announcement to myself' that he wanted to be an actor. </p> <p>After the unsettled childhood, he didn't have a pleasant adolescence. Firth saw the Winchester of the 70s, full of squaddies, Hampshire lads and public schoolboys, as a place seething with menace. 'People will laugh at this, this is going to sound hilarious to some people, but I've felt more threatened in a town in Hampshire than I've felt in central Los Angeles,' he tells me. At school in Winchester, and later at drama school, he resented the fact that people thought of him as posh. He felt conflicted; at school he roughened his accent. Talking about his school clearly makes him uncomfortable. He says, 'Every time I mention school, the headmaster writes to my parents.' </p> <p>This is odd. Here is Colin Firth, the man who played Valmont and Mr Darcy, still under the spell of his old headmaster. Here, perhaps, is a clue to other Firth characters - the evasive, squirming Geoffrey Clifton in The English Patient, the walled-in schoolboy Communist Tommy Judd in Another Country. Was Firth a bad boy at school? Referring to his old headmaster, he says, 'If ever I've suggested that I was, that's what he takes issue with. I was just quietly resistant, in a way. He had a lack of respect for me because I was neither an identifiable wild rebel nor someone who toed the line in a meaningful way.' Firth saw himself as a 'loner', a 'quiet opter-out'. He 'didn't really like the system, I didn't like the education. I didn't fight it very courageously. I just didn't go along with it very much.' </p> <p>As a teenager, he got into some fights, which 'tended to be with close friends, rather than strangers in the street'. He grew his hair long, wore beads and listened to progressive rock. He 'went the hippie route', and felt, he says, like a freak. Nick Hornby says that when Firth was preparing for his role in Fever Pitch, which is about a guy who uses football as an emotional crutch, he 'found the things that were about him... I know he really identified with all that rootless Home Counties stuff, the suburban need to belong.' Firth tells me plainly: 'I didn't like my life while I was at school. I can honestly say I don't feel that I was very happy at school ever.' </p> <p>At 16, the long-haired Yes and King Crimson fan found his feet; he went to sixth-form college. Suddenly, with his flares, his interest in books and rock music, he 'slotted in very nicely with the in-crowd'. But 'academically, it all went to pot'. When punk came along, Firth was not a convert. 'Progressive rock,' he says, 'had become so pompous, and that pompousness suited me, because I had become so well acquainted with it. There was so much snobbery. It was my sanctuary from the laddishness that I didn't fit in with.' He stuck to flares, too - the grandiosity of the late hippie period had become his identity. Once again, he was an outsider. </p> <p>Not feeling like a future heartthrob, Firth moved to London in 1978 to 'get near theatres'. He was miserable. This must have seemed like a last chance, a shot in the dark. He took a job answering the phone for the National Youth Theatre. He had no friends, enjoyed reading Kafka. He 'made tea' at the National Theatre's wardrobe department. He auditioned for a place at the Drama Centre, and got it. Christopher Fettes, who taught Firth there, says that 'as a boy and a young man, Colin was a person of conspicuous intelligence. Real intelligence. It is very rare to have the privilege of training people for the theatre who are by nature poets. And Colin is.' </p> <p>At the Drama Centre, Fettes explains, 'there is an insistence on the Stanislavsky Method'. The approach, which is Russian, is based on using your inner demons to express the emotions of your character; you turn your own frustration into someone else's. Fettes explains that while this approach 'simply doesn't suit the Anglo-Saxon temperament in many, many cases', Firth 'responded to the training on every level, right from the early stages'. </p> <p>Firth was taught the Laban theory of psychological types, and put through the paces of 'Russian emotional freedom and Jewish introspection'. He came to know the 'reality of the inner world'. Fettes says that 'when he was a boy, one saw a potential Paul Schofield in him'. The Drama Centre mounted a production of Hamlet, something they had not done before, and have not done since. Firth played the title role, and was immediately cast as Guy Bennett, the role eventually played in the film by Rupert Everett, in the West End production of Julian Mitchell's Another Country. </p> <p>Firth works best as an old-fashioned Englishman; he's harder to imagine as a foreigner or a contemporary type with an estuary accent. You can't quite see him as Ralph Fiennes's Nazi in Schindler's List, or a Tim Roth druggie. Nor can you see him as a wimp in a romantic comedy, as played by Hugh Grant. He is deeply English; he has managed to use his own troubles and frustrations to play unsettled, seething Englishmen. 'I've not been a peaceful person,' he tells me. Sometimes, he says, while acting on stage, he feels 'waves of loathing' emanating from the audience. </p> <p> Firth is happier to talk about his family background. He has a brother, Jonathan, who is six years younger and also an actor. Jonathan, he says, is 'a real gentleman. I'm much more of a talker. I find him a much more stable and self-contained person.' Whereas Jonathan is 'wry', Colin says of himself: 'A lot of things hit me without me seeing them coming. Disappointments would take me by surprise.' Colin, says Nick Hornby, 'laughs a lot, and likes to make people laugh'. He listens to a lot of music, including opera, and reads a lot. He loves Faulkner, which I wouldn't have expected. </p> <p>His parents met in India; his mother was three and his father was five. His mother's parents were missionaries, although 'they weren't the sort of missionaries who went around converting the natives and bashing people over the head with Christianity'. His father's father was also an ordained minister. You can see where his accent comes from; it's not the cut-glass Sloane accent, but something older, with a whiff of the Raj. Talking to him, you can sometimes see his Imperial cad in The Turn of the Screw; all it took was a pair of mutton-chop sideburns, and the transition was complete. </p> <p>After leaving the Drama Centre, Firth has never been out of work. After Another Country, he had, he says, 'cornered the market in wet, sensitive, naive young chaps'. He was still worried about what he thought of as his 'neutral face' - with such a face, he told one interviewer, he would do better in intense roles. In 1987, there was a breakthrough of sorts - he landed the role of Robert Lawrence, a disabled Falklands veteran, in Tumbledown. This was a chance to be madly intense, and Firth revelled in it. </p> <p>'I lived with him,' he says of Lawrence. 'And he was a goldmine. An articulate soldier who will talk.' Firth began to identify with Lawrence. He poured himself into the role. He even began to have nightmares about the Falklands war. When he looked at the camera as Lawrence, Firth says, 'his face was in my mind's eye. His face on me.' </p> <p>Firth pauses, and his expression changes. Sometimes his demeanour can appear to change instantly, without apparent effort. He said, 'At the time, I loved to think I was making this incredibly reckless sacrifice for my craft. If I was screwed up at the end, so be it. Now I can see that that was glamorous to me. I wasn't really suffering at all.' </p> <p>There was more intensity. In 1989, Firth was Adrian LeDuc in Apartment Zero, a psychological thriller set in Argentina; Firth studied Argentina, becoming fascinated with the place. He told one interviewer about how he saw tango as a metaphor for Argentina's political situation. Playing neurotics, he said, was 'a laugh'. By the mid-90s, he was a respected leading man, but not quite a star. He'd approached the title role in Valmont as 'the claw in the velvet glove'. Valmont flopped. In 1994, he played a nutcase in Master of the Moor, the Ruth Rendell mystery. </p> <p>And then came Darcy. Firth was offered the part of Mr Darcy in the television production of Pride and Prejudice; it changed the pattern of his career. The role, in which he spends most of the story glowering in the background, and then jumps fully clothed into a pond, made him into a star, and an official heartthrob. After Darcy, Christopher Fettes says, 'there was hardly a woman in England who wouldn't crawl on her knees to Moscow for a touch of his nether lip'. </p> <p>I ask him about Darcy jumping into the pond. Firth says, 'Originally I was supposed to take all my clothes off and jump into the pool naked. The moment where the man... is a man. Instead of a stuffed shirt. He's riding on a sweaty horse, and then he's at one with the elements. But the BBC wasn't going to allow nudity, so an alternative had to be found.' </p> <p>There were meetings. What could Darcy do with the pond, fully clothed? 'The alternative,' Firth says, 'went via underpants, which, actually, were not historical. He would never have worn underpants. They would have looked ridiculous anyway.' In the end, the inevitable decision was reached. As Firth put it, 'If you can't take them all off, just jump in.' </p> <p>The trouble was that Firth himself, as Bridget Jones was to discover, was not allowed to jump into the pond. Firth tells me, 'There's a thing called Wiles disease, which means you can't be insured to jump into a pond, because you can get sick from rat's piss. So we got a stuntman to do the actual dive.' A stuntman did the dive? So those mutton-chop sideburns flying through the air were not Firth. 'Everything is me, except there's a very, very brief shot of the stuntman in midair. Everything else is me.' </p> <p>Darcy, of course, is not a confused, post-feminist wimp. He is not remotely noncommittal. He was the best televisual real man for ages, and appealed directly to the growing constituency of lonely thirtysomething women. In Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, the heroine manages to get an interview with him, and asks him about the 'wet-shirt shots'. Then she asks about his next film, which, he tells her, is 'about moss'. </p> <p> I go to see the film about moss, My Life So Far, in which Firth plays a quaint Scottish aristocrat who has invented some new uses for sphagnum moss. He starts off nutty, and begins to smoulder as soon as Ir\u00e8ne Jacob appears on the scene. There are some great Firth moments, with the camera closing in on the hyper-expressive face as the tormented eyes slide around. He's also in a film called Londinium, as a man who is 'terribly gentlemanly but suddenly violently irascible' - a touch of the John Cleeses - and has a camp part in Relative Values, a film based on the No\u00ebl Coward play, alongside Julie Andrews and Stephen Fry. </p> <p>Firth says he is going to go off on holiday and read some books. 'I'm going through a big Graham Greene phase,' he says. He is an admirer of Ralph Fiennes, and would have loved Fiennes's part in The End of the Affair. 'He's got it covered,' says Firth. It could get quite exasperating, actually. He keeps eating up the things I'd like to do.' Firth twinkles again and laughs. </p> <p>Five years later, it is clear that Firth's tenure as a romantic lead is far from over. It might not be long before we see him in the clutches of Bridget Jones herself. Is that too much to ask? </p> <p>\u0095 My Life So Far opens on 12 May nationwide and Relative Values is released in June</p>",

Having accepted the part, he said, 'I don't know how much longer that sort of character will be available to me.' Afterwards, he was stunned at the way people identified him with the character. 'I felt as if I'd lost my whole personality,' he says. He tells me: 'It's been very strange, this idea of Mr Darcy appealing so much to women. Because obviously, as you can see, I don't carry that around with me. I'm not so Mr Darcy every day of my life. If people expect to see a saturnine, dark, smouldering tall aristocrat, they are going to be disappointed.' At rest, Firth's face is set in a sort of handsome grimace, he looks easily haunted. The mouth turns slightly down; the bones of the face cast shadows. But his expressions change with almost no effort; as an acting tool, this is a highly strung face. One slight touch on the happy pedal and he beams; an iota of misery and he glowers. 'I never saw myself as Mr Ugly, but I'm not that handsome,' he told me. 'I can sort of be made to look quite a lot better or quite a lot worse.' I first meet Colin Firth, now 39, on the set of Donovan Quick, a forthcoming BBC television film in which, as usual, he plays an intense, edgy fellow who hides behind a mask of English reticence. He is genial and welcoming, and speaks in that unusual, slightly old-fashioned voice which is perfect for costume drama. That's his actual voice. In person, Firth is not at all like Darcy. There is no sense of menace. Firth's character, obsessed with the tyranny of a national bus company, starts his own. Firth spends the day patiently approaching the bus, and entering the bus, and entering the bus, over and over. He takes instructions from the director, David Blair, with absolute humility. Before we meet again, I catch him several times on TV. He's prolific, having made more than 30 films, and you can often get a glimpse of him late at night, in a youthful guise. Sometimes he has a caddish moustache. Early Firth looked jittery and worried. The mature, smouldering Firth came later. Firth is very English; he plays people who hide their emotions. He often appears melancholic. Firth himself had an unhappy childhood. He once said: 'I'm very suspicious of people who romanticise their childhood.' Firth is married to Livia Guiggioli, an Italian documentary maker. Nick Hornby describes her as 'joke-perfect: PhD, beautiful in that sultry Italian way, funny and vivacious'. She is also, he says, 'very good for Firth, because she's absolutely not in any thrall to him'. She 'affects to be completely mystified' by the Mr Darcy situation. For three years in the 90s, Firth lived with the actress Meg Tilly, whom he fell in love with on the set of Milos Forman's Valmont. They have a son, Will, who is now nine. We met again, recently, in a film production office in London's West End. Again, Firth is impeccably warm and charming. He wears neutral clothes; his hair is on the short side of bouffant. Firth's hair is either quite short or quite long, never very short or very long. His characters are always outwardly respectable. He tells me he is about to go to Los Angeles to spend time with his son. He says, 'Los Angeles can actually be quite a relaxing place, but the minute you try to invest anything in it, it grabs you and starts to play games with you.' He already sounds like a character in a film. Another reason he is going to California, Firth says, is for 'my own personal relaxation, which is doing very little indeed'. He lived in Canada with Tilly, three hours inland from Vancouver. 'I'm too much of a lightweight for it,' he says. 'It's wilderness. Serious wilderness. It's not a trip to Wimbledon Common. And I rather fancied the quaint idea of the wilderness. It's really the middle of nowhere.' The move, he says, had been Tilly's decision. 'She found the place. I had a kind of reclusive impulse at the time, but not that reclusive. It was too wild. If you go north from where we were, there'd be nothing but woods and grizzly bears, until you get to the Arctic Circle. I found that oppressive. You couldn't even go for walks. There were instructions about going for walks. You take a flare and a map and a blanket and a bell, because within 20 minutes you can get lost by going round in circles.' Firth is gentlemanly, affable. With his deep, old-fashioned voice, he talks as if he were in a smoking room, holding a brandy bubble. We were quickly on to the subject of his childhood. Having been born in Africa, where his parents were teachers, he came to England at the age of four. Then, after stints in Billericay and Brentwood, the family moved to St Louis, Missouri, for a year. Firth was 12. When they came back to England, it was to another town, just outside Winchester. The young Firth felt unsettled. The year in America, he says, 'didn't feel like a very good thing at the time. It was probably a very good thing. I had a very bad time there.' The year abroad had done something to him. 'American kids,' he says, 'were a hell of a lot more sophisticated. I was barely out of grey shorts. I'd come out of primary school, where my classmates had grass-stained knees and collected football cards.' The American kids, on the other hand, 'were more like something out of Woodstock. I was like something out of Just William. They had slogans on their backs that were to do with the Vietnam war. I felt like a geek. I made up for it with a false cockiness. Before I got rejected, I would tell someone to fuck off. Someone would say, \"What's your name?\" and I'd say, \"Mind your own business.\"' This was how he started: the first serious acting he did was to pretend he was tough, when he was not. Looking at his facial expressions, at the layers of stoicism and reserve, one gets a sense of somebody deeply, quintessentially English. Firth's face was once described in The New York Times as 'strangely neutral'. Unlike Jude Law, or Ralph Fiennes, he does not easily slip into American; being in America as a child only made him more English. The English actors he likes are Albert Finney, Donald Pleasance and Sir Anthony Hopkins - men of elusive emotions and inner struggle. He tells me he went back to his American school in the 90s, and found, to his relief, that it was 'pretty nasty. The place was horrible and had the atmosphere of a reform school. It made me realise that it wasn't all me.' He had acted in pantomimes and school plays since the age of five. 'School plays,' he says, 'were always something where I was definitely praised and in demand; that wasn't true of most aspects of school life for me.' He wasn't the first to be picked for the football team, or particularly academic. When he was 14, he made 'an official announcement to myself' that he wanted to be an actor. After the unsettled childhood, he didn't have a pleasant adolescence. Firth saw the Winchester of the 70s, full of squaddies, Hampshire lads and public schoolboys, as a place seething with menace. 'People will laugh at this, this is going to sound hilarious to some people, but I've felt more threatened in a town in Hampshire than I've felt in central Los Angeles,' he tells me. At school in Winchester, and later at drama school, he resented the fact that people thought of him as posh. He felt conflicted; at school he roughened his accent. Talking about his school clearly makes him uncomfortable. He says, 'Every time I mention school, the headmaster writes to my parents.' This is odd. Here is Colin Firth, the man who played Valmont and Mr Darcy, still under the spell of his old headmaster. Here, perhaps, is a clue to other Firth characters - the evasive, squirming Geoffrey Clifton in The English Patient, the walled-in schoolboy Communist Tommy Judd in Another Country. Was Firth a bad boy at school? Referring to his old headmaster, he says, 'If ever I've suggested that I was, that's what he takes issue with. I was just quietly resistant, in a way. He had a lack of respect for me because I was neither an identifiable wild rebel nor someone who toed the line in a meaningful way.' Firth saw himself as a 'loner', a 'quiet opter-out'. He 'didn't really like the system, I didn't like the education. I didn't fight it very courageously. I just didn't go along with it very much.' As a teenager, he got into some fights, which 'tended to be with close friends, rather than strangers in the street'. He grew his hair long, wore beads and listened to progressive rock. He 'went the hippie route', and felt, he says, like a freak. Nick Hornby says that when Firth was preparing for his role in Fever Pitch, which is about a guy who uses football as an emotional crutch, he 'found the things that were about him... I know he really identified with all that rootless Home Counties stuff, the suburban need to belong.' Firth tells me plainly: 'I didn't like my life while I was at school. I can honestly say I don't feel that I was very happy at school ever.' At 16, the long-haired Yes and King Crimson fan found his feet; he went to sixth-form college. Suddenly, with his flares, his interest in books and rock music, he 'slotted in very nicely with the in-crowd'. But 'academically, it all went to pot'. When punk came along, Firth was not a convert. 'Progressive rock,' he says, 'had become so pompous, and that pompousness suited me, because I had become so well acquainted with it. There was so much snobbery. It was my sanctuary from the laddishness that I didn't fit in with.' He stuck to flares, too - the grandiosity of the late hippie period had become his identity. Once again, he was an outsider. Not feeling like a future heartthrob, Firth moved to London in 1978 to 'get near theatres'. He was miserable. This must have seemed like a last chance, a shot in the dark. He took a job answering the phone for the National Youth Theatre. He had no friends, enjoyed reading Kafka. He 'made tea' at the National Theatre's wardrobe department. He auditioned for a place at the Drama Centre, and got it. Christopher Fettes, who taught Firth there, says that 'as a boy and a young man, Colin was a person of conspicuous intelligence. Real intelligence. It is very rare to have the privilege of training people for the theatre who are by nature poets. And Colin is.' At the Drama Centre, Fettes explains, 'there is an insistence on the Stanislavsky Method'. The approach, which is Russian, is based on using your inner demons to express the emotions of your character; you turn your own frustration into someone else's. Fettes explains that while this approach 'simply doesn't suit the Anglo-Saxon temperament in many, many cases', Firth 'responded to the training on every level, right from the early stages'. Firth was taught the Laban theory of psychological types, and put through the paces of 'Russian emotional freedom and Jewish introspection'. He came to know the 'reality of the inner world'. Fettes says that 'when he was a boy, one saw a potential Paul Schofield in him'. The Drama Centre mounted a production of Hamlet, something they had not done before, and have not done since. Firth played the title role, and was immediately cast as Guy Bennett, the role eventually played in the film by Rupert Everett, in the West End production of Julian Mitchell's Another Country. Firth works best as an old-fashioned Englishman; he's harder to imagine as a foreigner or a contemporary type with an estuary accent. You can't quite see him as Ralph Fiennes's Nazi in Schindler's List, or a Tim Roth druggie. Nor can you see him as a wimp in a romantic comedy, as played by Hugh Grant. He is deeply English; he has managed to use his own troubles and frustrations to play unsettled, seething Englishmen. 'I've not been a peaceful person,' he tells me. Sometimes, he says, while acting on stage, he feels 'waves of loathing' emanating from the audience. Firth is happier to talk about his family background. He has a brother, Jonathan, who is six years younger and also an actor. Jonathan, he says, is 'a real gentleman. I'm much more of a talker. I find him a much more stable and self-contained person.' Whereas Jonathan is 'wry', Colin says of himself: 'A lot of things hit me without me seeing them coming. Disappointments would take me by surprise.' Colin, says Nick Hornby, 'laughs a lot, and likes to make people laugh'. He listens to a lot of music, including opera, and reads a lot. He loves Faulkner, which I wouldn't have expected. His parents met in India; his mother was three and his father was five. His mother's parents were missionaries, although 'they weren't the sort of missionaries who went around converting the natives and bashing people over the head with Christianity'. His father's father was also an ordained minister. You can see where his accent comes from; it's not the cut-glass Sloane accent, but something older, with a whiff of the Raj. Talking to him, you can sometimes see his Imperial cad in The Turn of the Screw; all it took was a pair of mutton-chop sideburns, and the transition was complete. After leaving the Drama Centre, Firth has never been out of work. After Another Country, he had, he says, 'cornered the market in wet, sensitive, naive young chaps'. He was still worried about what he thought of as his 'neutral face' - with such a face, he told one interviewer, he would do better in intense roles. In 1987, there was a breakthrough of sorts - he landed the role of Robert Lawrence, a disabled Falklands veteran, in Tumbledown. This was a chance to be madly intense, and Firth revelled in it. 'I lived with him,' he says of Lawrence. 'And he was a goldmine. An articulate soldier who will talk.' Firth began to identify with Lawrence. He poured himself into the role. He even began to have nightmares about the Falklands war. When he looked at the camera as Lawrence, Firth says, 'his face was in my mind's eye. His face on me.' Firth pauses, and his expression changes. Sometimes his demeanour can appear to change instantly, without apparent effort. He said, 'At the time, I loved to think I was making this incredibly reckless sacrifice for my craft. If I was screwed up at the end, so be it. Now I can see that that was glamorous to me. I wasn't really suffering at all.' There was more intensity. In 1989, Firth was Adrian LeDuc in Apartment Zero, a psychological thriller set in Argentina; Firth studied Argentina, becoming fascinated with the place. He told one interviewer about how he saw tango as a metaphor for Argentina's political situation. Playing neurotics, he said, was 'a laugh'. By the mid-90s, he was a respected leading man, but not quite a star. He'd approached the title role in Valmont as 'the claw in the velvet glove'. Valmont flopped. In 1994, he played a nutcase in Master of the Moor, the Ruth Rendell mystery. And then came Darcy. Firth was offered the part of Mr Darcy in the television production of Pride and Prejudice; it changed the pattern of his career. The role, in which he spends most of the story glowering in the background, and then jumps fully clothed into a pond, made him into a star, and an official heartthrob. After Darcy, Christopher Fettes says, 'there was hardly a woman in England who wouldn't crawl on her knees to Moscow for a touch of his nether lip'. I ask him about Darcy jumping into the pond. Firth says, 'Originally I was supposed to take all my clothes off and jump into the pool naked. The moment where the man... is a man. Instead of a stuffed shirt. He's riding on a sweaty horse, and then he's at one with the elements. But the BBC wasn't going to allow nudity, so an alternative had to be found.' There were meetings. What could Darcy do with the pond, fully clothed? 'The alternative,' Firth says, 'went via underpants, which, actually, were not historical. He would never have worn underpants. They would have looked ridiculous anyway.' In the end, the inevitable decision was reached. As Firth put it, 'If you can't take them all off, just jump in.' The trouble was that Firth himself, as Bridget Jones was to discover, was not allowed to jump into the pond. Firth tells me, 'There's a thing called Wiles disease, which means you can't be insured to jump into a pond, because you can get sick from rat's piss. So we got a stuntman to do the actual dive.' A stuntman did the dive? So those mutton-chop sideburns flying through the air were not Firth. 'Everything is me, except there's a very, very brief shot of the stuntman in midair. Everything else is me.' Darcy, of course, is not a confused, post-feminist wimp. He is not remotely noncommittal. He was the best televisual real man for ages, and appealed directly to the growing constituency of lonely thirtysomething women. In Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, the heroine manages to get an interview with him, and asks him about the 'wet-shirt shots'. Then she asks about his next film, which, he tells her, is 'about moss'. I go to see the film about moss, My Life So Far, in which Firth plays a quaint Scottish aristocrat who has invented some new uses for sphagnum moss. He starts off nutty, and begins to smoulder as soon as Ir\u00e8ne Jacob appears on the scene. There are some great Firth moments, with the camera closing in on the hyper-expressive face as the tormented eyes slide around. He's also in a film called Londinium, as a man who is 'terribly gentlemanly but suddenly violently irascible' - a touch of the John Cleeses - and has a camp part in Relative Values, a film based on the No\u00ebl Coward play, alongside Julie Andrews and Stephen Fry. Firth says he is going to go off on holiday and read some books. 'I'm going through a big Graham Greene phase,' he says. He is an admirer of Ralph Fiennes, and would have loved Fiennes's part in The End of the Affair. 'He's got it covered,' says Firth. It could get quite exasperating, actually. He keeps eating up the things I'd like to do.' Firth twinkles again and laughs. Five years later, it is clear that Firth's tenure as a romantic lead is far from over. It might not be long before we see him in the clutches of Bridget Jones herself. Is that too much to ask? \u0095 My Life So Far opens on 12 May nationwide and Relative Values is released in June",

We fight with knives.

'The Group that Sits up All Night for Matches' is the literal translation of Turkey's most dangerous gang. About 100-strong, it's led by two Istanbul men, one called Sofden and another known simply as Arab, who is now the chief remaining target for police who have watched TV footage of Wednesday's mayhem. </p> <p>They have not found him yet, but Jarik thinks they will, even in this heaving city of 15 million people: 'When Turkish police go looking for someone, they will always find him, eventually.' </p> <p>Arab's group have been responsible for a number of murders in recent years, say the police. They have been unable to convict anyone, but they now they have a serious chance. </p> <p>The Group that Sits up All Night for Matches does exactly what it says on the tin. It targets rival fans the night before games - most of them against Fenerbahce - and has been known to break into hotels at 3am, its members having met that day in the city's parks to sharpen their weapons and talk tactics. </p> <p>Which is almost certainly what happened on Wednesday. Confirmation that Arab is the number one suspect means the gang was involved, and strongly suggests that the Leeds fans who say they were victims of a set-up are right. </p> <p>But it is more complex: the British were also attacked by non-gang members, passing motorists and waiters. And for that, tragically, it seems the Leeds fans must accept a share of blame; had the gang not thought themselves vindicated, and had the violence been sanctioned by the hot blood of passers-by, Chris Loftus and Kevin Speight might be alive today. </p> <p>It had started so well. Despite Galatasaray's reputation, and growing threats on the Internet, there were none of the expected inflammatory Welcome to Hell banners at the airport as the Leeds team and fans arrived. </p> <p>Speight, the 40-year-old Farnsley publican and father of two, chatted proudly to Leeds striker Alan Smith as they walked through the airport concourse. It was a cool day as they boarded buses for the centre of this ancient city. They dumped their bags and headed, pronto, for the nearest friendly pubs. </p> <p>The James Joyce, a typical Irish theme pub abroad, is in the Western-friendly laby-rinth of tat around Buyuk Parmak Kapi. It has a poster of Irish post offices on the wall, and most of the staff struggle to understand the word Guinness. Barmaid Gulsum Borut had a visit earlier in the week from a staffer at the British Consulate, who said the English fans would head there. He gave her a telephone number in case of trouble, though he didn't expect any. </p> <p>Gulsum, who has worked in London and Dublin,did not expect trouble, either. 'I know the English,' she said. But at 8.30pm on Wednesday she found herself reluctantly rooting around for the number. 'It was getting a bit out of hand. I may understand the English, but other Turkish people do not. The swearing was loud, constant. Everything was effing this, you c---. </p> <p>'An English policeman came down, very quickly.

A couple of scuffles took place, and one local was accidentally knocked to the ground. At around this time, it appears, the Arab's team in the area were beginning to report back on mobile phones. They were probably planning trouble anyway, but now it looked as though they were going to have an excuse. </p> <p>And they got it. Within one hour, most of the remaining Leeds fans, about 50, had begun moving north, to Taksim Square itself.

The Leeds fans fought back, but were terrified by the ferocity, the unanimity, of the attacks on them. Many reported a complete absence of help from police, although one officer was seen on TV giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

      "body": "<p>There is perfection in a can of Heinz baked beans. The contrast between the bland bean and its sweet sauce; the reassuring uniformity of a commercial recipe; the timeless design of the turquoise and black label; the perfect ratio of bean to sauce, and the way the brick-red gunge magically suspends its cargo of little haricots on the fork. Then there is the speed at which your meal will be on the table; the fact that the beans will taste just as good forked straight from the can as they will if you make the decision to dirty a saucepan, and of course the information that they are free from artificial colours, preservatives and flavours, suitable for vegetarians and for those on a gluten-free diet. </p> <p>Even the figures come up to scratch: there is something quietly pleasing about the ratio of 51 per cent sauce and 49 per cent beans, as if the two had signed some sort of contract; the food police must love the 7.7g fibre, the 0.4 per cent saturated fat and the 4.7g of protein that lurks every 100g. And all of us, I'm sure, are relieved that they are still only 33p a can. </p> <p>The manufacturers even tell us how to open the can, how to heat the beans in a microwave and how long they will last in the refrigerator. Then of course there is the comforting feeling that we, as consumers have the upper hand over a giant manufacturer - they change a single detail of our beloved beans, and there will be riots in the streets. </p> <p>Of course, the product has its failings. If you are following the printed opening instructions (1. Place can on flat surface with tab nearest you and lift tab fully), then you can't see instructions 2 or 3; unused beans should not be stored in their can despite the fact that, all over the country there are fridges with half-eaten cans of beans festering in them; a can contains too much for one and not quite enough for two, and that it contains over 25g of sugar, which, by my reckoning, is the equivalent of about eight sugarcubes. And no matter how quickly you eat them, they still go cold by the time you get to the last forkful. </p> <p>These seductive little beans also have a curious habit of bringing on bouts of onanistic prose. On toast, they are nothing short of sheer culinary genius. They are, I would argue, at their point of perfection when you can catch them just at the point when the sauce is on the verge of soaking through the bread, so that you get both slightly soggy dough yet still a hint of crispness. (There they go again.) Then there are those last few crumbs from the blackened crust, and then the final bean and its smudge of sauce. As I said, perfection. </p> <p>If anyone suspects I am quietly taking the piss, they couldn't be more wrong. I just love them. I could eat beans any time of day or night. Hot or cold. On toast or not. Just so long as I can eat beans. I must say I prefer them on buttered white toast and flatly refuse to respond to well-meaning suggestions that they are even healthier on brown toast. And yet this is a quite recent development - I ate my first baked bean aged about 25. </p> <p>Of course, there are other brands of commercially made beans such as Whole Earth, the Rolls-Royce of canned beans, with their apple juice, sea salt, cinnamon and dill, and an organic version that also boasts brown rice flour, tamari soy sauce and ocean kelp. They are as good as canned beans could ever be, the beans plump, the sauce more savoury than sweet and far from the gilded lilies they sound, being low in sugar and fat and having a flavour that seems more akin to home cooking. I do buy and enjoy these bells-and-whistles type of beans, and relish both their flavour and the integrity of the ingredients but I must be honest, good as they are, they are not what I want when I feel like beans on toast. Then it has to be the turquoise can. </p> <p>Home-made beans in tomato sauce can be good, too, though of course they will never be quite as good as the real thing. I often bake boiled haricot, cannelini or butter beans slowly in a thick sauce of tomatoes, onions and herbs, and often throw in a sausage or two. Pork's natural affinity with beans of any sort can be something to take advantage of here. Try tucking a ham hock or lump of pancetta in among the beans, the mildly cured ham adding a smoky campfire flavour, and then you get the porky bits to pick at, too. </p> <p>It was with grilled pork chops in mind that I made a sort of Chinese bean dish a couple of days ago, dark and glossy with soy, ginger and aniseed. The recipe is below. I finished it off the next day with some sausages. Which reminds me. Has anyone seen those cans of beans with little chipolata sausages in lately? Or have they gone the way of those other lost delicacies, flavoured Dairylea and Spangles? </p> <p><strong> Butter beans with mustard and muscovado</strong><br> A deep cast-iron or enamelled casserole is what you need to slow-bake the beans that follow. Baked here with dark sugar, mustard and chilli, they are good for a cool spring day, with perhaps a plate of greens on the side. You don't have to stick to the butter beans I suggest - any bean, and especially the mottled maroon borlotti or round white haricot, will produce a similar, though slightly less mealy result. The oregano I used was not the usual Italian one but a heady Mexican one from the Cool Chile Company (check out <a href=\"http://www.coolchile.co.uk\">www.coolchile.co.uk</a> for mail-order details). Serves 4 as a main dish. </p> <p>300g butter beans <br>2 medium onions <br>a little vegetable or groundnut oil <br>3 large cloves of garlic <br>6 tomatoes <br>1 or 2 large, hot chillies <br>1 tsp dried oregano <br>500ml of the bean-cooking liquor <br>3 tsps grain mustard <br>2 tsps dark muscovado sugar </p> <p> <strong> to finish</strong><br> a small handful of grated Pecorino or Parmesan cheese <br>a handful of fresh breadcrumbs </p> <p>Soak the beans in cold water overnight, then bring them to the boil and simmer till tender - a good 45 minutes. </p> <p>Heat the oven to 180\u00b0C/gas mark 4. Peel and slice the onions and let them cook in a little vegetable or groundnut oil over a low to moderate heat until they are deep golden and soft enough to squash between your fingers. Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the garlic and add it. Quarter the tomatoes, seed and finely chop the chilli, adding them as the garlic begins to soften. </p> <p>Stir in the oregano, 500ml of the cooking liquor from the beans, the mustard and the sugar. Season with a little salt, then bring to the boil, leave it to bubble for a minute or so, then cover with a lid and transfer to the hot oven. Leave the beans be for a good hour then remove the lid and sprinkle over the crumb topping, returning to the oven for about 20 minutes or till golden and bubbling. </p> <p> <strong> Chickpeas with soy and anise</strong><br> Baked beans with a Chinese note, deeply flavoured with liquorice. The recipe is far from authentic, but none the worst for that. I served it with grilled pork chops and sausages, though it would be just the job for baked gammon, too. Some greens alongside, perhaps pak choi in oyster sauce, would be appropriate. Serves 4 as a side dish. </p> <p>250g chickpeas <br>vegetable or groundnut oil <br>3 small medium onions, peeled and roughly chopped <br>6 cloves of garlic <br>a thumb-sized piece of ginger <br>3 tbsps dark soy sauce <br>1 tbsp dark muscovado sugar <br>2 small, hot chillies <br>500ml vegetable stock (I suggest Marigold vegetable bouillon) <br>6 star anise </p> <p><strong> to finish</strong><br> 1 tsp cornflour <br>2 tsps water </p> <p>Soak the chickpeas overnight in cold water, then drain them and bring them to the boil in a change of water. Turn them down to a rolling boil and let them cook for a good 45 minutes till tender and plump. </p> <p>Heat the oven to 180\u00b0C/gas mark 4. Warm the oil in a casserole and add the chopped onions, letting them cook until soft and translucent. Meanwhile, peel the garlic, then peel the ginger and cut it into matchsticks, then add both to the softening onions. When they have softened a little, stir in the soy sauce, sugar and the chillies (you can leave them whole), then pour in the stock and drop in the star anise. Bring to the boil, then tip in the drained cooked chickpeas. </p> <p>Bake, covered with a lid for an hour, then remove from the oven. Mix the cornflour and water to a smooth paste, then tip it into the beans and stir over a moderate heat. The sauce will thicken slightly.</p>",

The crowd vows to keep Eli\u00e1n in almost as virulently as it promises to keep the Feds out.</p> <p>Javier Hern\u00e1ndez had come to Miami from San Antonio in Texas and camped out for four nights with his son Bruno, aged 18. He has no intention of leaving until the boy is 'safe to stay in the United States'. He warns: 'This is from the heart and from the hip, there are people here prepared to go to jail over this.'</p> <p>Reno is a native of Miami and once served here as district attorney. She is now portrayed on placards with horns coming out of her head.</p> <p>Another picket, Juan Pedrosa, vowed: 'If the Feds come in for him, it'll be another Waco. The boy stays, at whatever cost.'</p> <p>It is certain that neither the Miami Cubans nor the feds have the stomach for another Waco, but last weekend saw a taste of how the human shield views the forces of law: police barriers were knocked aside by a crowd surging towards the bungalow. Members of the former Alpha 66 paramilitary group have trained people in resistance tactics.</p> <p>On Friday afternoon, by way of a pre-emptive strike, demonstrators planned to cause havoc by blockading Miami airport. The plan was postponed after Reno's announcement of tomorrow's meeting.</p> <p>Faced with the threat of violence in Little Havana, Penelas walked a high wire on Friday, with loaded language: 'This issue is evolving so quickly that it is impossible for us to guarantee order in every possible scenario.'</p> <p>He casually tossed a further match into the powder keg by saying that the Clinton administration will be 'held responsible for anything that occurs'. Penelas is a Democrat.</p> <p>The passions of the Cuban exiles have been raised many times before. For 40 years, they have propelled US politics, fuelling invasion attempts, CIA plots and the notorious embargo against Cuba.</p> <p>The dynamo behind all this is the formidable muscle of the Cuban American National Foundation, built upon the construction empire of its godfather, the late Jorge Mas Canosa, after whom a boulevard is named. But the transition from father to son in the leadership of the CANF is indicative of politics in Miami - Mas Canosa Jnr spends more time on the family business than on overthrowing Fidel Castro.</p> <p>And this is why the family's defiance is doomed to fail. The unique Cuban diaspora has indeed created a community quite apart from any notion of the American 'melting pot', but it is no longer homogeneous or acting en masse .</p> <p>As the big sun sank slowly over Little Havana's Calle Ocho on Friday, the old men were playing chess in the Mart\u00ed gardens and young men were driving too fast with booming salsa, as usual. These people are here to stay.</p> <p>The Eli\u00e1n crisis has plastered over the demographic and political realities of the Cuban exile community. By the year 2020, Miami will be 60 per cent Hispanic, but most of them will either not come from Cuba or will be second-generation immigrants.</p> <p>For now, however, all this is cast aside in the drama as Gonz\u00e1lez prepares to meet his son - perhaps as early as tomorrow.</p> <p>Meanwhile, by way of a continual but barely noticed backdrop to the negotiations and demonstrations in Havana, more wretched Cuban boat people than ever continue to drift across the perilous Florida straits, heading for the US, despite a frantic crackdown in Cuba where, says a dissident activist, 'one boy has changed the policy'.</p>",

Javier Hern\u00e1ndez had come to Miami from San Antonio in Texas and camped out for four nights with his son Bruno, aged 18. He has no intention of leaving until the boy is 'safe to stay in the United States'. He warns: 'This is from the heart and from the hip, there are people here prepared to go to jail over this.' Reno is a native of Miami and once served here as district attorney. She is now portrayed on placards with horns coming out of her head. Another picket, Juan Pedrosa, vowed: 'If the Feds come in for him, it'll be another Waco. The boy stays, at whatever cost.' It is certain that neither the Miami Cubans nor the feds have the stomach for another Waco, but last weekend saw a taste of how the human shield views the forces of law: police barriers were knocked aside by a crowd surging towards the bungalow. Members of the former Alpha 66 paramilitary group have trained people in resistance tactics. On Friday afternoon, by way of a pre-emptive strike, demonstrators planned to cause havoc by blockading Miami airport. The plan was postponed after Reno's announcement of tomorrow's meeting. Faced with the threat of violence in Little Havana, Penelas walked a high wire on Friday, with loaded language: 'This issue is evolving so quickly that it is impossible for us to guarantee order in every possible scenario.' He casually tossed a further match into the powder keg by saying that the Clinton administration will be 'held responsible for anything that occurs'. Penelas is a Democrat. The passions of the Cuban exiles have been raised many times before. For 40 years, they have propelled US politics, fuelling invasion attempts, CIA plots and the notorious embargo against Cuba. The dynamo behind all this is the formidable muscle of the Cuban American National Foundation, built upon the construction empire of its godfather, the late Jorge Mas Canosa, after whom a boulevard is named. But the transition from father to son in the leadership of the CANF is indicative of politics in Miami - Mas Canosa Jnr spends more time on the family business than on overthrowing Fidel Castro. And this is why the family's defiance is doomed to fail. The unique Cuban diaspora has indeed created a community quite apart from any notion of the American 'melting pot', but it is no longer homogeneous or acting en masse . As the big sun sank slowly over Little Havana's Calle Ocho on Friday, the old men were playing chess in the Mart\u00ed gardens and young men were driving too fast with booming salsa, as usual. These people are here to stay. The Eli\u00e1n crisis has plastered over the demographic and political realities of the Cuban exile community. By the year 2020, Miami will be 60 per cent Hispanic, but most of them will either not come from Cuba or will be second-generation immigrants. For now, however, all this is cast aside in the drama as Gonz\u00e1lez prepares to meet his son - perhaps as early as tomorrow. Meanwhile, by way of a continual but barely noticed backdrop to the negotiations and demonstrations in Havana, more wretched Cuban boat people than ever continue to drift across the perilous Florida straits, heading for the US, despite a frantic crackdown in Cuba where, says a dissident activist, 'one boy has changed the policy'.",

      "bodyText": "Britain has halved its aid to Ethiopia, despite a drought which has triggered the worst food shortages in the Horn of Africa since the terrible famine that killed a million Ethiopians in the mid-1980s. Despite fresh evidence of the massive scale of the disaster threatening Ethiopia, International Development Secretary Clare Short has cut Ethiopia's three-year aid programme from \u00a339.3 million to \u00a319m, because of fears that renewal of war with Eritrea will stop the cash from getting through to projects to tackle poverty and illiteracy. The revelation of the decision by Short's department to reduce Ethiopia's level of long-term aid, comes amid accusations from the Ethi-opian government that major Western donors, including the European Union, have exacerbated the famine crisis by failing to deliver promised shipments of food aid. Ethiopian officials claimed yesterday that their government had distributed hundreds of thousands of tonnes of food aid from its own stores after receiving written assurances from Western donors that the supplies would be replenished as soon as possible. The aid was distributed throughout the country in 1998 and in the early months of last year to cope with serious shortfalls in food. However, the donors never made up the loss, leaving the government with only 30,000 tonnes to meet the current crisis - enough for only two weeks' emergency distribution. Burhane Gizaw, the deputy commissioner of the government's Disaster Prevention Planning Committee, said that the European Union alone had failed to replenish 78,000 tonnes from the stores. 'It is grossly irresponsible to say the least. To promise help and then not deliver it is worse than never promising anything at all, \" he said. The separate decision by Short's Department for International Development to cut its levels of assistance to Ethiopia comes amid a restructuring of Britain's aid package to Africa. Short is cutting Mozambique's aid budget by \u00a324 million, saying that the country, devastated by floods in February and March, is cash-rich and its government is too 'weak' to see long-term aid projects through successfully. And in the most controversial move, Short is increasing levels of aid to Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone, despite international condemnation of President Robert Mugabe for his threat to declare war on white farmers, and the lack of credibility of the peace process in Sierra Leone. The decisions, revealed in an annual report published last week by Short's department, are likely to shock members of the public who have given vast sums towards famine and flood relief in Africa. Tory international development spokesman Gary Streeter said: 'If this is correct ... this is morally reprehensible and repugnant.' Patrick Smith, of Africa Confidential, added: 'You can make an ethical case against Ethiopia because of the war, but not against Mozambique, which has done almost everything right, post civil war. It's a very strange decision.' The decisions are in line with a strict policy laid down by Short that her aid budget must be used for long-term projects to eradicate poverty, not as an emergency fund for short-term disaster relief. But in Ethiopia this weekend it was the issue of the missing food aid that was most pressing. For in addition to the non-delivery of EU food aid, the US government owes the Ethiopian Emergency Food Security Reserve (EFRS) 90,000 tonnes. Most of this food is expected to arrive by the end of the month; it was meant to arrive in November but loading at docks is said to have taken longer than expected. The food is desperately needed as famine starts to bite. Though exact casualty figures are difficult to find, at least a dozen children a day are dying at a single refugee camp in the south-eastern Ogaden province visited by The Observer last week.",

The gaffe-prone International Development Secretary who chastised Montserrat's volcano-stricken people for 'wanting golden elephants'; and who told us not to bother giving money to famine-hit Sudan in 1998 as they had sufficient aid, has quietly cut financial assistance to some of Africa's most stricken countries. As we report this week, Ethiopia - in the grip of a terrible drought and subsequent famine - has seen its aid budget cut from \u00a339 million to \u00a319m over three years.

The gaffe-prone International Development Secretary who chastised Montserrat's volcano-stricken people for 'wanting golden elephants'; and who told us not to bother giving money to famine-hit Sudan in 1998 as they had sufficient aid, has quietly cut financial assistance to some of Africa's most stricken countries. As we report this week, Ethiopia - in the grip of a terrible drought and subsequent famine - has seen its aid budget cut from \u00a339 million to \u00a319m over three years. Her officials will no doubt argue that the present war between Ethiopia and Eritrea is the reason, amid fears that aid would be diverted to the war.

      "body": "<p>A sinister smirk crept across the face of 'Hitler' Hunzvi. He looked at me and nodded as a burly deputy threatened: 'Do not go to those marches or you will die.'</p> <p>Hunzvi is currently the most feared man in Zimbabwe and one of the most powerful. He leads the association of 55,000 people who fought in the war against Rhodesian rule.</p> <p>Under Hunzvi's leadership the War Veterans of Zimbabwe have invaded more than 900 white-owned farms and claimed them as their own. They have beaten hundreds of farm workers and about 50 white farm owners.</p> <p>Shown cuts and bruises I'd received after being hit by a large rock thrown by one of his followers, Hunzvi was belligerent. 'Were you on the march?' he asked. I explained that I had been reporting on the 'Peace March' in Harare eight days ago by a multiracial crowd of 4,000 who were calling for an end to violence and intimidation. It had been attacked by 200 members of Hunzvi's War Veterans of Zimbabwe wielding clubs, iron bars and stones.</p> <p>The veterans injured 20 people. No one was arrested. Hunzvi was seen with the veterans at the headquarters of President Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF party as they armed themselves with crude weapons shortly before their attack on the march.</p> <p>'The commercial farmers, who are white, organised that march,' said Hunzvi with his sly smile. 'They want to stop Zimbabwe's indigenous people from getting back their land. That's why we had to respond. You were a casualty of that.'</p> <p>Agrippa Gava, Hunzvi's deputy, pointed at me. 'You look like a commercial farmer. So avoid those gatherings,' he warned, saying that, if I went to the marches, I could be killed.</p> <p>'You whites stole the land from the people of Zimbabwe,' continued Gava in a bitter tirade. 'If you don't like it, then you should just go away. Zimbabwean land is for the Zimbabwean people.' Hunzvi agreed and then strode away, surrounded by his ever-present phalanx of six men.</p> <p>Before my interview with Hunzvi, I waited in the small reception room of the veterans' association offices.

      "bodyText": "A sinister smirk crept across the face of 'Hitler' Hunzvi. He looked at me and nodded as a burly deputy threatened: 'Do not go to those marches or you will die.' Hunzvi is currently the most feared man in Zimbabwe and one of the most powerful. He leads the association of 55,000 people who fought in the war against Rhodesian rule. Under Hunzvi's leadership the War Veterans of Zimbabwe have invaded more than 900 white-owned farms and claimed them as their own. They have beaten hundreds of farm workers and about 50 white farm owners. Shown cuts and bruises I'd received after being hit by a large rock thrown by one of his followers, Hunzvi was belligerent. 'Were you on the march?' he asked. I explained that I had been reporting on the 'Peace March' in Harare eight days ago by a multiracial crowd of 4,000 who were calling for an end to violence and intimidation. It had been attacked by 200 members of Hunzvi's War Veterans of Zimbabwe wielding clubs, iron bars and stones. The veterans injured 20 people. No one was arrested. Hunzvi was seen with the veterans at the headquarters of President Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF party as they armed themselves with crude weapons shortly before their attack on the march. 'The commercial farmers, who are white, organised that march,' said Hunzvi with his sly smile. 'They want to stop Zimbabwe's indigenous people from getting back their land. That's why we had to respond. You were a casualty of that.' Agrippa Gava, Hunzvi's deputy, pointed at me. 'You look like a commercial farmer. So avoid those gatherings,' he warned, saying that, if I went to the marches, I could be killed. 'You whites stole the land from the people of Zimbabwe,' continued Gava in a bitter tirade. 'If you don't like it, then you should just go away. Zimbabwean land is for the Zimbabwean people.' Hunzvi agreed and then strode away, surrounded by his ever-present phalanx of six men. Before my interview with Hunzvi, I waited in the small reception room of the veterans' association offices. Taped to the wall was a front-page newspaper report of the attack on the march. 'Havoc in City' shouted the headline over a chilling photo of Hunzvi's men brandishing bars and sticks and bricks. I pointed to the photo and the secretary grinned. 'I'm very happy,' said a smug Hunzvi at the start of the interview. 'The passage of the constitutional amendment on land comes as a welcome relief to the war veterans.' On Thursday the constitutional amendment passed its third reading in parliament by the two-thirds majority needed. It states that if the British Government does not pay compensation for land stolen from Africans in the colonial period, then the Zimbabwe government is under no obligation to pay for white-owned land redistributed to blacks. Hunzvi rejected the suggestion that his war veterans would leave the farms they are now occupying. 'We will be intensifying our efforts to redistribute the land to the Zimbabwean people,' he said. 'Our people are not squatters on commercial farms, they are Zimbabweans on Zimbabwean land. That is the land that we went to war for, and we are going to stay on that land.' When asked about the High Court order that the war veterans should leave the farms, Hunzvi retorted angrily. 'Why should we observe the law? What laws did you observe when you came and stole the land from the African people? Did you think of law when you grabbed our land?' I was not able to correct Hunzvi that I had not stolen any land nor was I a representative of the people who did seize land from the Africans during the colonial period. He just continued on his rant against British colonialists. When asked how the poor blacks staking out plots on the large farms would get the money to redevelop the land, Hunzvi had a quick answer. 'If the indigenous people cannot get money to develop the farms, then we must get it from the banks,' he said. 'These foreigners, or commercial farmers as they call themselves, get money from the banks. Then let us get money from the banks. 'If this is our country then we should have all the resources of this country. Every bank should support the people of Zimbabwe.'

In the past few days several journalists have been threatened by the squatters at farms. Camera crews have been beaten, cars have been damaged and a reporter from Zimbabwe's Daily News was held for a couple of hours. 'If you (journalists) go alone to the farms, then you will be detained, yes,' said Hunzvi, as that sly grin slipped across his face again. 'If you want to go with me, then we can go together.'

Was there some kind of digital self-preservation going on - IT systems looking after their own? But no, this is normal. Crashes, glitches, failures of all kinds are the part of the digital present that is omnipresent. What about the economic inefficiency and human frustration that computers also bring? </p> <p>I have seen three laptops die so far. One simply had a nervous breakdown, went catatonic and has never woken up again. It has half a bad novel inside it so I've never quite brought myself to throw it out. Another fell victim to my brutal, if fast, keyboard technique, developed on East German typewriters 20 years back. Eventually, the keys pinged off. A third caught a virus and went mad. Friends have got it sort-of working again, but it is now determinedly eccentric, unreliable and blinks at me in a dazed fashion when I try to turn it on. (Which makes me, I suddenly notice, sound a bit like Ted Hughes. First time that's happened.) </p> <p>More generally, I have had money accidentally removed from bank accounts, seen work disappear, wasted afternoons in offices when computers have crashed, spent hours trying to book holidays online before realising that what I actually needed was to talk to a human being, and vanished into the black hole of computer telephony stabbing 'the star button' miserably in the vain hope of finding a friendly ear. And from what I can gather, these experiences are normal. Expanded generally, they suggest that IT can lead to worse business judgments as well as faster ones and lose sales as well as gain them. </p> <p>This question of computer inefficiency is not, in the end, the important one. This is still an infant Henry Ford-era industry when you can have any laptop you want as long as it's black, possesses far more computing power than you need and falls apart easily. Better designed, more reliable and even prettier machines are coming along all the time. </p> <p>But thinking about the cumbersome and inefficient aspects of IT is a useful way into the bigger questions about it. Neil Postman, a New York professor, suggests that, with any new technology you should ask: 'What is the problem to which this is a solution?' To which any student of public affairs would want to add: and to whom does this solution give wealth and power, and who loses? After the stock exchange crash, another huge round of local bank closures, caused primarily by new technology, and the devastating judgment against Microsoft, followed by the slide in IT stocks, all these questions seem particularly potent. </p> <p>The original Postman question could be answered by saying that the problems of slowness in business and the power of the old political and media \u00e9lite are problems to which the Internet age offers solutions. It puts consumers in touch with suppliers and it makes available unimaginable amounts of information to everyone who can afford a computer - or soon, a new-generation mobile phone. It speeds up and it opens up. E-mailing solves the problem of long, burbly phone calls. And, if you believe the prediction that a third or more of Britain's commuters will become teleworkers, urban congestion and car pollution are other obvious problems it helps solve. </p> <p>These are real benefits. They are one reason why, despite the gleeful prophets of cyber-doom, the soaring dot-com shares, then their fall to more realistic valuations, is not a disaster or a re-run of the Dutch tulip mania. Whatever happens to Martha Lane Fox (who seems to me to be behaving with admirable coolness) and her company, the idea behind it will work. That, in itself, is a store of value in comparison with other investment fevers, like the tulip bubble of the seventeenth century. Tulips look nice. You can paint them. If in very dire straits, you might try to eat them. But they are not a transforming technology. </p> <p>When you come on to the 'who gains, who loses?' category of questions, however, it gets harder. For - another Postman point - technology also limits our options and undoes previous ways of living and working. Imagine, for instance, the parallel Britain of 2000 in which television had never happened - a country of ubiquitous and lavish cinemas, telephone news services, thicker newspapers; a place where piano playing, singing and sheet-music sales were central to daily life, not marginal. To say that we prefer it our way is too easy: the technology changed us all. </p> <p>So, today, with the Internet economy, the paths untaken are all around us. We are opting for a huge social shift in which more and more (banking, shopping, entertainment, working) is done not face to face but by cables looping past our front doors. The draw-bridging of everyday life, an ultimate privatisation of the community, could not have happened without tiny lines engraved on silicon. </p> <p>Who does it benefit? People who are useful 'information workers' already, who are plugged in, whose credit ratings are good. If the Government was prepared to push this, it could also be the most powerful force in regional policy for generations, as the lower living costs and higher labour-pool persuade companies to site call centres outside the south-east.

But so far, they are less secure and less unionised. </p> <p>The bleak news is for lower-middle-class, home-owning, service-sector workers. Even before last week's bank closures, some 150,000 banking employees are said to have lost their jobs in the past decade. Thanks to computer telephony, only a small minority will be needed for the switch to online. Similarly, though online shopping ought to provide a bonanza time for delivery companies, including the Post Office, it may hit a host of specialist high street retailers. </p> <p>The final big loser/winner issue is about politics and power. The old model, in which authority was held by governments and passed down by a media \u00e9lite, with privileged access not only to people but information, is clearly under threat.

Many people won't want to bother. They will prefer to trust an organisation or brand to do it for them. But equally, more and more will simply bypass the old media - which means they may bypass old assumptions too.

We faced charges of being a monopoly and acting anti-competitively in the past and came through it. I'm sure the business will fend off these new accusations. Now if you'll excuse me I have a company to run.' </p> <p>With that William Jefferson Gates III, chief executive officer of Bio-Tech Inc, the world's largest biotechnology company, jumped into his wired-up state-of-the-art motor launch and headed across Seattle's Lake Washington to a mooring offshore from his billion dollar home/office complex. </p> <p>Welcome to the future, 10 years from now. It is a world where Microsoft has become far more powerful: where its software has migrated from the computer on your office desk to your hi-fi, to your digital television, to your intelligent fridge, to your palmtop personal organiser and, of course, to the mobile phone built into your tie clip. And, yes, in this scenario, Microsoft, even without Bill Gates, is again on the receiving end of the largest anti-trust trial in history, this time charged with trying to dominate the Internet in an anti-competitive manner. </p> <p>In this scenario, Gates resigned from the company in 2002. His shock exit, following a boardroom coup, came only a few months after Microsoft agreed to open up its Windows source code to competitors, unbundle its Internet Explorer browser software and pay a hefty, undisclosed fine (rumoured to be about $70 billion) following a successful appeal against a Supreme Court judgment that it should be broken up into several different businesses. </p> <p>Microsoft, bloodied but unbowed, returned to its core competence: developing software. This vision had been spelt out in the previous century when Gates announced he was to step down as Microsoft boss to become chief software architect, changing the company's focus from an applications and operating system manufacturer to a firm which could teach the World Wide Web to sing in perfect harmony. </p> <p>At the time of his resignation in 1999, Gates said: 'I'm returning to what I love most - focusing on technologies for the future.' The plan, which Microsoft was to realise only following the ousting of Gates, saw the company reassert its dominance in the software market. </p> <p>Gates, incandescent at his betrayal, subsequently sold almost all of his 21 per cent stake in the business through a series of private placings and used the money to fund his other great passion - biotechnology - quickly building the sector's biggest firm. </p> <p>Despite the acrimonious departure, Microsoft was to thank Gates for sowing the seeds which grew into the Microsoft of 2010.

      "bodyText": "\"I have nothing to say about this. I hold only a tiny stake in Microsoft these days. We faced charges of being a monopoly and acting anti-competitively in the past and came through it. I'm sure the business will fend off these new accusations. Now if you'll excuse me I have a company to run.' With that William Jefferson Gates III, chief executive officer of Bio-Tech Inc, the world's largest biotechnology company, jumped into his wired-up state-of-the-art motor launch and headed across Seattle's Lake Washington to a mooring offshore from his billion dollar home/office complex. Welcome to the future, 10 years from now. It is a world where Microsoft has become far more powerful: where its software has migrated from the computer on your office desk to your hi-fi, to your digital television, to your intelligent fridge, to your palmtop personal organiser and, of course, to the mobile phone built into your tie clip. And, yes, in this scenario, Microsoft, even without Bill Gates, is again on the receiving end of the largest anti-trust trial in history, this time charged with trying to dominate the Internet in an anti-competitive manner. In this scenario, Gates resigned from the company in 2002. His shock exit, following a boardroom coup, came only a few months after Microsoft agreed to open up its Windows source code to competitors, unbundle its Internet Explorer browser software and pay a hefty, undisclosed fine (rumoured to be about $70 billion) following a successful appeal against a Supreme Court judgment that it should be broken up into several different businesses. Microsoft, bloodied but unbowed, returned to its core competence: developing software. This vision had been spelt out in the previous century when Gates announced he was to step down as Microsoft boss to become chief software architect, changing the company's focus from an applications and operating system manufacturer to a firm which could teach the World Wide Web to sing in perfect harmony. At the time of his resignation in 1999, Gates said: 'I'm returning to what I love most - focusing on technologies for the future.' The plan, which Microsoft was to realise only following the ousting of Gates, saw the company reassert its dominance in the software market. Gates, incandescent at his betrayal, subsequently sold almost all of his 21 per cent stake in the business through a series of private placings and used the money to fund his other great passion - biotechnology - quickly building the sector's biggest firm. Despite the acrimonious departure, Microsoft was to thank Gates for sowing the seeds which grew into the Microsoft of 2010. Previously its formula for success had been simple: dominant PC operating systems led to dominant applications which led to the chance to dominate emerging markets. But once this loop was broken, Microsoft knew it needed a new game plan. The Internet brought new competitors, new distribution methods and, most importantly, new opportunities. The radical transformation began in the year 2000, so ... back to the present. Few people have yet heard of Distributed interNet Architecture (DNA) and even fewer people know how it will work, but it is clear that Gates and Microsoft see it as crucial to the company's longevity. The software writing involved in DNA may be complicated but the idea is simple: Microsoft wants to create and impose its own standards and protocols on the Internet. As the way we access and use the Net changes, ensuring a common set of standards will be crucial. Companies and individuals want seamless communication links: after all, who ever got excited about disjointed communication? Currently the standards which are used to allow cooperating computers to share resources across networks are called TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol). Software experts argue that Microsoft's DNA plan amounts to the introduction of its own set of protocols which will allow new generations of intelligent devices to talk to each other. 'If the Department of Justice is worried about the browser situation, this is Rockefeller and John Pierpoint Morgan rolled into one with turbo-charged stripes,' said one technology expert.

      "body": "<p>We are in the first class carriage of the 15.25 from Cardiff to London on Friday. Tony Blair is on his way home after a tour of south Wales. His hair is flecked with grey; he has taken his jacket off. Frankly, he looks tired.</p> <p>For the last two days, the Prime Minister has been grappling once more with those who claim he is only interested in Middle Britain. He has cajoled, exhorted and explained to those in the health service that they must produce change. In the same week, he has faced backbench rebellions on Freedom of Information and the restoration of the link between pensions and earnings. This week he will launch the campaign for the local elections on 4 May, a date when Labour expects hundreds of losses across the country. London is likely to vote for Ken Livingstone as mayor on the same day.</p> <p>But this is also a man who is about to become a father. Nothing reveals more about the relentless nature of the ordinary world out there than that. It is humbling and Blair strikes a new, humbler pose. He is the man accused of control freakery who says that maybe, just maybe, he should loosen up a bit. He is accused of abusing power of patronage but says he gives away more power than anyone. He uses the word 'normal', says that he is doing all he can; asks for people to be patient. Yet all the while he knows he has got to deal with nappies in seven weeks' time.</p> <p>'We're a very normal family,' he says. 'We're very fortunate that we're a happy family together. What you have got to realise is that I know that at some point I stop doing this job. People are interested in me at the minute but there will still come a point in time when they are not.'</p> <p>He pauses and glances out of the window. 'I will still be a father, though.'</p> <p>He feels uncomfortable talking about it, says that he is bemused by all the interest. But he also knows that his fatherhood is political, that his every move will be scrutinised for evidence of his modernity, for evidence of the country we live in and our attitude to families. It has started one of the most important debates on family and work this country has seen.</p> <p>Blair knows also that it is a time when the family he has worked so hard to protect will be in the limelight. 'There will be publicity, but it will pass. We have absolutely no desire to be treated like the royal family.' There will be one set of photographs and then pleas to be left alone.</p> <p>I volunteer that my wife and I are expecting our first baby in a month. 'Are you?' Blair says, 'You will need lots of advice.' Again he is the normal man, encouraging me to 'enjoy yourself' and 'have a few nights out' before the baby arrives. 'You'll be ready for a rest after two days of it,' he says. 'You'll be ready for a rest by going back to work. Looking after a baby is a darn sight harder than anything else you will do.' He laughs.</p> <p>So he will take limited paternity leave: deal with the biggest issues and leave the detail to others. He will have to let go, for a few weeks at least, so he can help Cherie wipe up sick, or rock the baby to sleep on his shoulder like a very modern father. And Britain will still continue.</p> <p>Now he seems driven to leave a message about what he wants, before his break. He talks widely, roving over drugs, health, Northern Ireland, the Lords, women in politics. And dripping throughout is the theme of control, and what Blair wants to say about it.</p> <p>In his interview with friend and confidant Robert Harris in the US magazine Talk last week, Blair said: 'Sometimes I think the experiences in the Labour Party in the early Eighties almost sort of scarred me too much, in terms of the Labour Party and how it had to be.'</p> <p>I ask him about it. He spends a while thinking about his answer, aware that he does not want it twisted into something else. 'You can see this in relation to Wales,' he says carefully. 'Essentially you have got to let go of it with devolution.' Alun Michael's demise and the rise of Blair's bogy man, Rhodri Morgan, to first secretary of Wales, encapsulates the issue. 'I would have to say I got that judgement wrong,' he says of his original desire to see Morgan fail. 'You've got to exercise discretion. You've got to know the battles to fight and the battles not to fight.'</p> <p>But there are enemies, and the Government must beware. 'What you have to remember, and this is a very important point, the whole strategy of the right-wing media and the Tories is to turn our strengths into weaknesses. So the discipline, strength, cohesion we have in the Labour Party, the absence of which has for years destroyed the Labour Party's ability to govern, is now portrayed as control freakery.</p> <p>'We never go back. One, we have to be a disciplined, sensible political party. Secondly we never, ever, give in to this nonsense about choosing between Middle Britain and the heartlands.'</p> <p>The point of the trip to south Wales is obvious. It is the cradle of industrial Britain, the heart of Labour's heartlands, the place that returned a certain James Keir Hardie in a cloth cap to take his seat at Westminster.</p> <p>It used to be coal and iron country. But the Prime Minster didn't open a new mine or smelter. On Thursday afternoon he opened a factory in Cwmbran that makes first-class airline seats. Later he launched an information technology course in Merthyr Tydfil, Hardie's political home. It neatly illustrates the changing face of Britain.</p> <p>The countryside outside slips by. Blair stares out as the train rolls past Newport, around Bristol, past Swindon and Reading and on to London. Outside the first class carriage are the people he governs, all with hopes, demands, desires. And Blair must fulfil them.</p> <p>'I am always impatient at the pace of change,' he says. 'We have done an immense amount, there's a lot done, there's a lot more to do.'</p> <p>He is in charge and you still wait a year for a cataract operation. So he rushes around, cajoling, learning methods and ideas that might speed up the process of change.</p> <p>'Nothing prepares you for the relentlessness of it,' he says, later adding: 'The adrenalin keeps you going'.</p> <p>How do you keep in touch, stay out of the establishment bubble that can engulf and obfuscate? 'I go out constantly and meet people and take questions and answers. I think I must be the first Prime Minister to do regular question and answer sessions with the public. I will do discussions with doctors, nurses, teachers, you know, private discussions as well where we sit down and go through things. I am kept in touch, I am kept in touch by my family and my kids and kept in touch by my friends. My very close friends aren't really in politics.'</p> <p>The question is now all about ground level change: make changes, invest money and hope people notice.</p> <p>'People are feeling it but there is a lot of change they want in their lives. Yes, people are thankful for the increase in child benefit but they're still hard pressed. Yes, pensioners understand that there's the \u00a3150 winter allowance now, there's the free TV licence for the over 75s, there's the free eye tests, but people want more.'</p> <p>'What have we got to say to people?' he says. 'Well, we've got to say this is a journey of renewal. We're not saying this journey's finished. We have only been in power just under three years!'</p> <p>He has statistics to combat what he believes is ignorance by many in Labour's constituency of how much the Government has done. The minimum wage, he says. Enhanced family credit, he says. A million pensioners out of poverty, a million children out of poverty via child benefit and the working families tax credit, the largest ever investment in schools and hospitals, an increase in overseas development aid.</p> <p>Despite the best efforts of the Telegraph and Daily Mail, Blair will not move on drugs. Jack Straw said last week there was a 'coherent argument' for cannabis decriminalisation. He is willing to discuss downgrading ecstasy from a Class A to Class B drug. 'We're not refusing to listen to the debate,' Blair said. 'We just haven't agreed with the conclusion that those who want to decriminalise it reach. I think it's wrong and I think it will lead to a series of problems that we have to confront. There are no plans to change the position.' He knows he needs to push Lords reform, after pressure from the leader of the Lords, Baroness Jay, and the Lord Chancellor, Derry Irvine. The quicker he moves the quicker he can rid himself of the 'Tony's cronies' tag.</p> <p>'There is a load of complete rubbish talked about me and my power of patronage. I am going to be the first Prime Minister that actually gives up the power of patronage.' But what about rich Labour friends with new peerages; Waheed Ali, Melvyn Bragg, David Sainsbury?</p> <p>'They are in there as... working peers for the Labour Party, they are in there because they have made a contribution to the Labour Party, but if they happen to be key business people it is excellent for us that someone like David Sainsbury is willing to come into the House of Lords and be a minister. Yes, he is a contributor to the Labour Party and why on earth shouldn't he be?'</p> <p>It has often been said, and speaking to him it seems true, that critics of New Labour irritate Blair. They say he has no ideology, that he does what he thinks will play well with Worcester Woman, that he has no faith in the party. His response? 'Rubbish.'</p> <p>In his speech in Merthyr Tydfil, Blair evokes the red flag, Nye Bevan and the 1831 revolt against working conditions in the local iron works. It doesn't sound natural.</p> <p>And as he sits the next day on the train, one of his answers explains why. 'People often think... I don't have convictions because I don't fit into that conventional compartmentalisation of politics. But my conviction is that that is just a redundant set of ideas, that is a twentieth century ideology, an ideological set of dividing lines that have gone. The big issue today is how do you revive the notion of solidarity, government, action by the community to advance the individual... for today's world? I think there is a very clear political philosophy at the heart of what the Government is doing.'</p> <p>The waves will keep coming. Northern Ireland ('We have got to get people refocused on how we build the confidence to get the institutions up and running again'), women in Parliament ('I would very much like to see an increase at the next general election'), the modernisation of Parliament ('I hope the programme comes on as quickly as possible').</p> <p>And among it all he finds time for his family and a new child. 'It is important in fact that you do spend time with the family and relax. I have never... believed that it is sensible to work 24 hours a day.'</p> <p>He asks for tea. A pot is brought over, he pours and it spills onto the table. He laughs. Just a normal guy, who spent 10 minutes waiting on the Cardiff platform for the 15.25 to London to arrive. Just like everyone else.</p> <p>kamal.ahmed@observer.co.uk</p>",

I am kept in touch, I am kept in touch by my family and my kids and kept in touch by my friends. My very close friends aren't really in politics.' The question is now all about ground level change: make changes, invest money and hope people notice. 'People are feeling it but there is a lot of change they want in their lives. Yes, people are thankful for the increase in child benefit but they're still hard pressed. Yes, pensioners understand that there's the \u00a3150 winter allowance now, there's the free TV licence for the over 75s, there's the free eye tests, but people want more.' 'What have we got to say to people?' he says. 'Well, we've got to say this is a journey of renewal. We're not saying this journey's finished. We have only been in power just under three years!' He has statistics to combat what he believes is ignorance by many in Labour's constituency of how much the Government has done. The minimum wage, he says. Enhanced family credit, he says. A million pensioners out of poverty, a million children out of poverty via child benefit and the working families tax credit, the largest ever investment in schools and hospitals, an increase in overseas development aid. Despite the best efforts of the Telegraph and Daily Mail, Blair will not move on drugs. Jack Straw said last week there was a 'coherent argument' for cannabis decriminalisation. He is willing to discuss downgrading ecstasy from a Class A to Class B drug. 'We're not refusing to listen to the debate,' Blair said. 'We just haven't agreed with the conclusion that those who want to decriminalise it reach. I think it's wrong and I think it will lead to a series of problems that we have to confront. There are no plans to change the position.' He knows he needs to push Lords reform, after pressure from the leader of the Lords, Baroness Jay, and the Lord Chancellor, Derry Irvine. The quicker he moves the quicker he can rid himself of the 'Tony's cronies' tag. 'There is a load of complete rubbish talked about me and my power of patronage. I am going to be the first Prime Minister that actually gives up the power of patronage.' But what about rich Labour friends with new peerages; Waheed Ali, Melvyn Bragg, David Sainsbury? 'They are in there as... working peers for the Labour Party, they are in there because they have made a contribution to the Labour Party, but if they happen to be key business people it is excellent for us that someone like David Sainsbury is willing to come into the House of Lords and be a minister. Yes, he is a contributor to the Labour Party and why on earth shouldn't he be?' It has often been said, and speaking to him it seems true, that critics of New Labour irritate Blair. They say he has no ideology, that he does what he thinks will play well with Worcester Woman, that he has no faith in the party. His response? 'Rubbish.' In his speech in Merthyr Tydfil, Blair evokes the red flag, Nye Bevan and the 1831 revolt against working conditions in the local iron works. It doesn't sound natural. And as he sits the next day on the train, one of his answers explains why. 'People often think... I don't have convictions because I don't fit into that conventional compartmentalisation of politics. But my conviction is that that is just a redundant set of ideas, that is a twentieth century ideology, an ideological set of dividing lines that have gone. The big issue today is how do you revive the notion of solidarity, government, action by the community to advance the individual... for today's world? I think there is a very clear political philosophy at the heart of what the Government is doing.' The waves will keep coming. Northern Ireland ('We have got to get people refocused on how we build the confidence to get the institutions up and running again'), women in Parliament ('I would very much like to see an increase at the next general election'), the modernisation of Parliament ('I hope the programme comes on as quickly as possible'). And among it all he finds time for his family and a new child. 'It is important in fact that you do spend time with the family and relax. I have never... believed that it is sensible to work 24 hours a day.' He asks for tea. A pot is brought over, he pours and it spills onto the table. He laughs. Just a normal guy, who spent 10 minutes waiting on the Cardiff platform for the 15.25 to London to arrive. Just like everyone else. kamal.ahmed@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Remember the much-abused stakeholding, hailed for a brief two weeks as New Labour's big idea after Tony Blair's 'stakeholder' speech in Singapore in January 1996? It died a quick death. Today, as the Government looks unnervingly without a compass in its relations with business, it is a casualty Mr Blair may come to regret.</p> <p>Blair was attracted to stakeholding because it offered a coherent plan to reform the welfare state and be friendly to business. All with a lineage that was left of centre. The concept, despite claims that it was incomprehensible, is disarmingly simple. All actors in a capitalist economy should be seen not simply as having individual freedom to do whatever they please, but rather as being at the centre of a reciprocal web of claims and obligations.

It died a quick death. Today, as the Government looks unnervingly without a compass in its relations with business, it is a casualty Mr Blair may come to regret. Blair was attracted to stakeholding because it offered a coherent plan to reform the welfare state and be friendly to business. All with a lineage that was left of centre. The concept, despite claims that it was incomprehensible, is disarmingly simple.

      "body": "<p>The building site sits uneasily in the midst of a stunning cityscape. To the east, the Royal Palace of Holyrood; to the north, the neo-classical folly of Calton Hill; to the west, the castle and the buzzing commercial heart of the new Edinburgh.</p> <p>Behind the ugly wall of scarred chipboard hoardings which marks the perimeter of the site, an architectural masterpiece should be taking shape which its supporters claim will fit perfectly alongside its historic immediate neighbours and rival the Guggenheim in Bilbao or the new Reichstag in Berlin.</p> <p>Instead, more than two years since the Holyrood plans were first announced, Scotland's new parliament building, symbol of democracy's return north of the border, remains a muddy, rain-filled crater into which the nation's faith in the entire devolution project has sunk.</p> <p>This week, after months of turmoil over spiralling costs and bickering over the design, Scottish politicians voted narrowly to press ahead with the Holyrood parliament, despite a price tag almost six times the original estimate: from \u00a340m to \u00a3230m.</p> <p>The result means that the two cranes, the earth-moving equipment and the rest of the plant which have lain idle on the site for so long may at last see active service.</p> <p>But the protracted and expensive row over the building project has put serious question marks over the ability of Edinburgh's new political class to make self-government a success.</p> <p>The fiasco has kept long-standing critics of devolution in bliss, with every mistake being used as evidence to pronounce the nation incapable of governing itself.</p> <p>Doubts remain among many committed devolution campaigners this weekend that Scotland's politicians will ever be able to rescue not only their own reputation but that of the institution.</p> <p>'Things couldn't really get any worse,' one Labour insider told The Observer. 'The parliament's credibility is so badly damaged now that the whole image is one of incompetence.</p> <p>'Everything MSPs touch seems to go badly wrong. It has become a huge embarrassment.'</p> <p>At the centre of the debacle has the been the building's price tag.</p> <p>Last week, Lib Dem MSP Nora Radcliffe was going through her mail when she opened an envelope, the contents of which poignantly underlined just how pathetic the affair had become.</p> <p>Inside the letter from an anonymous elderly widow was a donation of \u00a3100 to go towards the costs of a building meant to be an ambitious statement of its status as western Europe's newest democratic forum.</p> <p>The saga began when Donald Dewar, then Scottish Secretary, chose Holyrood over rival sites including Calton Hill - the nationalist's preferred choice - as the home of the parliament.</p> <p>The initial estimate for the cost of the new building, including fees and VAT, had been \u00a340m but in January 1998, that had risen to \u00a350m.</p> <p>Two months later, Dewar revealed that that figure would cover only building work. Fees and VAT would be extra.</p> <p>An international architectural competition to design a magnificent new legislature had been won by Spaniard Enric Miralles, who impressed Dewar and a committee of judges, which included television presenter Kirsty Wark, with his modernist conceptual drawings.</p> <p>The centrepiece would be a debating chamber in the shape of upturned boats.</p> <p>But in June last year, the real trouble started. Within weeks of acquiring their powers, MSPs began to question the wisdom of the Miralles plan and the Holyrood site.</p> <p>The upturned boats design was criticised, and Sir David Steel, the parliament's presiding officer and chairman of the all-party group which had taken over the running of the project from the old Scottish Office, demanded that the flattened shape of the chamber's interior be changed to an elliptical shape.</p> <p>Further changes followed thick and fast. As MSPs demanded ever more office space, the total floor space for the building leapt from an original 16,000 sq m to more than 30,000 sq m.</p> <p>A month later, the consequences of this dithering over the design were revealed when a report by Sir David's corporate body put the new cost at \u00a3109m.</p> <p>Donald Dewar refused to rule out further increases, experts predicted ominously that the final bill could reach \u00a3130m.</p> <p>Nevertheless, MSPs approved the \u00a3109m budget and dismissed the warnings as unrealistic.</p> <p>And so they proved to be. Ten days ago, with a brick still to be laid, an independent report into the debacle, by the architect John Spencely, revealed the full depth of the parliament crisis.</p> <p>If no cuts were ordered, the final bill would be a staggering \u00a3230.8m - almost six times the original estimate.</p> <p>The former president of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland had gloomier news: the building was now so far behind schedule that estimates of it being completed by Christmas 2002 and occupied by August 2003 were wildly optimistic.</p> <p>The main cause of problems was the condition of Queensberry House, a seventeenth-century listed building which was incorporated into the design as office space for the presiding officer and a reception area for MSPs.</p> <p>An earlier survey of the building pronounced it sound, but when contractors took the roughcast off the masonry and the plaster off the walls, they realised that it was in severe danger of falling down.</p> <p>Spencely recommended the Queensberry House plan, which will now take up to \u00a311m to achieve, be abandoned. But under proposals approved by MSPs last week, it will remain in the design.</p> <p>The budget has now been capped at \u00a3195m and a completion date set of December 2002. It will be an uphill task to meet these targets.</p> <p>Savings of 20 per cent must be found. Work on the foundations is about 10 months behind schedule.</p> <p>So far, only work on the car park and the superstructure of the MSP's office block has got under way.</p> <p>And there was further bad news for the project this week when it emerged that Miralles had been taken seriously ill in the United States, and was this weekend recovering from surgery amid rumours that he had a brain tumour.</p> <p>'It's got nothing to do with the Scots being incapable,' said Margo Macdonald of the SNP, who this week tried to have the building project halted so that alternatives could be considered.</p> <p>'Donald Dewar sold us a pup. He got caught up with the \"cool Britannia\" drivel and picked a wild design. Then he blamed the parliament.'</p> <p>It is not just members of the opposition who are furious at Dewar. Already his closest Ministers are jostling for position with Henry McLeish the front runner.</p> <p>'Donald can't survive many more disasters,' a Labour source said. 'The fiasco with the parliament building proves how badly flawed his judgment is. That's why the whole thing is going to hell in a handcart.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "The building site sits uneasily in the midst of a stunning cityscape. To the east, the Royal Palace of Holyrood; to the north, the neo-classical folly of Calton Hill; to the west, the castle and the buzzing commercial heart of the new Edinburgh. Behind the ugly wall of scarred chipboard hoardings which marks the perimeter of the site, an architectural masterpiece should be taking shape which its supporters claim will fit perfectly alongside its historic immediate neighbours and rival the Guggenheim in Bilbao or the new Reichstag in Berlin. Instead, more than two years since the Holyrood plans were first announced, Scotland's new parliament building, symbol of democracy's return north of the border, remains a muddy, rain-filled crater into which the nation's faith in the entire devolution project has sunk. This week, after months of turmoil over spiralling costs and bickering over the design, Scottish politicians voted narrowly to press ahead with the Holyrood parliament, despite a price tag almost six times the original estimate: from \u00a340m to \u00a3230m. The result means that the two cranes, the earth-moving equipment and the rest of the plant which have lain idle on the site for so long may at last see active service. But the protracted and expensive row over the building project has put serious question marks over the ability of Edinburgh's new political class to make self-government a success. The fiasco has kept long-standing critics of devolution in bliss, with every mistake being used as evidence to pronounce the nation incapable of governing itself. Doubts remain among many committed devolution campaigners this weekend that Scotland's politicians will ever be able to rescue not only their own reputation but that of the institution. 'Things couldn't really get any worse,' one Labour insider told The Observer. 'The parliament's credibility is so badly damaged now that the whole image is one of incompetence. 'Everything MSPs touch seems to go badly wrong. It has become a huge embarrassment.' At the centre of the debacle has the been the building's price tag. Last week, Lib Dem MSP Nora Radcliffe was going through her mail when she opened an envelope, the contents of which poignantly underlined just how pathetic the affair had become. Inside the letter from an anonymous elderly widow was a donation of \u00a3100 to go towards the costs of a building meant to be an ambitious statement of its status as western Europe's newest democratic forum. The saga began when Donald Dewar, then Scottish Secretary, chose Holyrood over rival sites including Calton Hill - the nationalist's preferred choice - as the home of the parliament. The initial estimate for the cost of the new building, including fees and VAT, had been \u00a340m but in January 1998, that had risen to \u00a350m. Two months later, Dewar revealed that that figure would cover only building work. Fees and VAT would be extra. An international architectural competition to design a magnificent new legislature had been won by Spaniard Enric Miralles, who impressed Dewar and a committee of judges, which included television presenter Kirsty Wark, with his modernist conceptual drawings. The centrepiece would be a debating chamber in the shape of upturned boats. But in June last year, the real trouble started. Within weeks of acquiring their powers, MSPs began to question the wisdom of the Miralles plan and the Holyrood site. The upturned boats design was criticised, and Sir David Steel, the parliament's presiding officer and chairman of the all-party group which had taken over the running of the project from the old Scottish Office, demanded that the flattened shape of the chamber's interior be changed to an elliptical shape. Further changes followed thick and fast. As MSPs demanded ever more office space, the total floor space for the building leapt from an original 16,000 sq m to more than 30,000 sq m. A month later, the consequences of this dithering over the design were revealed when a report by Sir David's corporate body put the new cost at \u00a3109m. Donald Dewar refused to rule out further increases, experts predicted ominously that the final bill could reach \u00a3130m. Nevertheless, MSPs approved the \u00a3109m budget and dismissed the warnings as unrealistic. And so they proved to be. Ten days ago, with a brick still to be laid, an independent report into the debacle, by the architect John Spencely, revealed the full depth of the parliament crisis. If no cuts were ordered, the final bill would be a staggering \u00a3230.8m - almost six times the original estimate. The former president of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland had gloomier news: the building was now so far behind schedule that estimates of it being completed by Christmas 2002 and occupied by August 2003 were wildly optimistic. The main cause of problems was the condition of Queensberry House, a seventeenth-century listed building which was incorporated into the design as office space for the presiding officer and a reception area for MSPs. An earlier survey of the building pronounced it sound, but when contractors took the roughcast off the masonry and the plaster off the walls, they realised that it was in severe danger of falling down. Spencely recommended the Queensberry House plan, which will now take up to \u00a311m to achieve, be abandoned. But under proposals approved by MSPs last week, it will remain in the design. The budget has now been capped at \u00a3195m and a completion date set of December 2002. It will be an uphill task to meet these targets. Savings of 20 per cent must be found. Work on the foundations is about 10 months behind schedule. So far, only work on the car park and the superstructure of the MSP's office block has got under way. And there was further bad news for the project this week when it emerged that Miralles had been taken seriously ill in the United States, and was this weekend recovering from surgery amid rumours that he had a brain tumour. 'It's got nothing to do with the Scots being incapable,' said Margo Macdonald of the SNP, who this week tried to have the building project halted so that alternatives could be considered. 'Donald Dewar sold us a pup. He got caught up with the \"cool Britannia\" drivel and picked a wild design. Then he blamed the parliament.' It is not just members of the opposition who are furious at Dewar. Already his closest Ministers are jostling for position with Henry McLeish the front runner. 'Donald can't survive many more disasters,' a Labour source said. 'The fiasco with the parliament building proves how badly flawed his judgment is. That's why the whole thing is going to hell in a handcart.'",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When Rolf Borjesson took over as chief executive of Rexam almost four years ago, he professed himself 'impressed by the... potential' within many of the group's businesses. He clearly meant their potential to find buyers. Only three businesses - healthcare, beauty and food packaging - have survived his restructuring and, once the acquisition of American National Can (ANC) is completed, they will represent just a quarter of the group. </p> <p>The result, Borjesson hopes, is a packaging company that is not at the mercy of economic cycles. While it is not brave enough to promise ever-increasing profits, it does believe that it will be far less affected by economic downturn than some rivals. </p> <p>Its business certainly looks more resilient now than in 1995, when almost two-thirds of its sales went into building, engineering and similar industries. Most of these have gone, although it is still seeking buyers for the building and coated films businesses. Once those sales, and last week's ANC purchase, are complete then more than three-quarters of its business will be supplying cans and other beverage packaging. </p> <p>The ANC acquisition makes the PLM deal look more than just an opportunistic move on a lowly-rated Swedish company. PLM was one of four players in the European market; adding ANC catapults it into the leading position in Europe and gives a strong position in the US, where ANC is one of the four leaders. </p> <p>With old economy stocks out of favour everywhere, Rexam has picked up ANC for just 12 times last year's earnings and is promising unquantified synergies - in things like purchasing and logistics - which should bring that multiple down. Rexam itself is on an even lower multiple of around 10 times last year's earnings, which means it was uneconomic to use cash. But it is confident that the profits of the business will be covering the cost of financing the \u00a31.3 billion of debt - and that implies an increase of at least 10 per cent on the \u00a3154 million profit the business made last year. </p> <p>Funding the entire \u00a31.3bn through debt will stretch Rexam's balance sheet even further. But, when the proceeds of the disposals come through, debt should be roughly equal to net assets and profits should cover interest by about four times. Rexam did the same thing to buy PLM but its strong cashflow means that was quickly reduced. </p> <p>The jitters among technology stocks is starting to focus investors' minds on the potential among some old economy stocks, and Rexam does offer decent value. When the dust settles in 2001, it should be making around 37p a share. That puts it on a multiple of just six while the yield is a generous 6.7 per cent. Tuck some away before the price rises even further. </p> <p><strong> Little to build on </strong><br> It is one of the biggest conundrums of the mortgage price war. Borrowers are being offered better and better deals - and astute ones don't even have to move lender, never mind house, to get them. Yet the fierce competition does not seem to be having any impact on the lender's margins. Why? </p> <p>Simon Samuels and his fellow trainspotters at Salomon Smith Barney have just completed an exhaustive survey of mortgage offers and deals available over the last five years to work this out. Their conclusion is that lenders have been able to steal a bit back from their savers - building societies are very clever about putting mortgage rates up further and faster than savings rates. They have also been able to rely on the 'cushion' of their existing lending - mortages taken out years ago by people who cannot be bothered to change. </p> <p>Unfortunately for building societies, that is unlikely to continue. Savers are voting with their feet and signing up with Egg, Standard Life or whichever institution is offer ing the best deal.

      "bodyText": "When Rolf Borjesson took over as chief executive of Rexam almost four years ago, he professed himself 'impressed by the... potential' within many of the group's businesses. He clearly meant their potential to find buyers. Only three businesses - healthcare, beauty and food packaging - have survived his restructuring and, once the acquisition of American National Can (ANC) is completed, they will represent just a quarter of the group. The result, Borjesson hopes, is a packaging company that is not at the mercy of economic cycles. While it is not brave enough to promise ever-increasing profits, it does believe that it will be far less affected by economic downturn than some rivals. Its business certainly looks more resilient now than in 1995, when almost two-thirds of its sales went into building, engineering and similar industries. Most of these have gone, although it is still seeking buyers for the building and coated films businesses. Once those sales, and last week's ANC purchase, are complete then more than three-quarters of its business will be supplying cans and other beverage packaging. The ANC acquisition makes the PLM deal look more than just an opportunistic move on a lowly-rated Swedish company. PLM was one of four players in the European market; adding ANC catapults it into the leading position in Europe and gives a strong position in the US, where ANC is one of the four leaders. With old economy stocks out of favour everywhere, Rexam has picked up ANC for just 12 times last year's earnings and is promising unquantified synergies - in things like purchasing and logistics - which should bring that multiple down. Rexam itself is on an even lower multiple of around 10 times last year's earnings, which means it was uneconomic to use cash. But it is confident that the profits of the business will be covering the cost of financing the \u00a31.3 billion of debt - and that implies an increase of at least 10 per cent on the \u00a3154 million profit the business made last year. Funding the entire \u00a31.3bn through debt will stretch Rexam's balance sheet even further. But, when the proceeds of the disposals come through, debt should be roughly equal to net assets and profits should cover interest by about four times. Rexam did the same thing to buy PLM but its strong cashflow means that was quickly reduced. The jitters among technology stocks is starting to focus investors' minds on the potential among some old economy stocks, and Rexam does offer decent value. When the dust settles in 2001, it should be making around 37p a share. That puts it on a multiple of just six while the yield is a generous 6.7 per cent. Tuck some away before the price rises even further. Little to build on It is one of the biggest conundrums of the mortgage price war. Borrowers are being offered better and better deals - and astute ones don't even have to move lender, never mind house, to get them. Yet the fierce competition does not seem to be having any impact on the lender's margins. Why? Simon Samuels and his fellow trainspotters at Salomon Smith Barney have just completed an exhaustive survey of mortgage offers and deals available over the last five years to work this out. Their conclusion is that lenders have been able to steal a bit back from their savers - building societies are very clever about putting mortgage rates up further and faster than savings rates. They have also been able to rely on the 'cushion' of their existing lending - mortages taken out years ago by people who cannot be bothered to change. Unfortunately for building societies, that is unlikely to continue. Savers are voting with their feet and signing up with Egg, Standard Life or whichever institution is offer ing the best deal. More seriously, discounted rates are becoming a bigger proportion of the mortgage book. The mortgage price war has been raging for five years and Salomons calculates that, over that period, more than \u00a3450bn has been lent to housebuyers - \u00a3114bn of that in the bumper 1999 alone.
