      "body": "<p>There's something surreal about seeing half of one of the biggest bands of the 90s in the cramped confines of the Leadmill, especially when that half includes Graham Coxon. The idiosyncratic Blur guitarist is painfully shy and famously loathes the spotlight. This would prompt anyone to wonder just why he is not only embarking on a solo tour but actually fronting a band. However, Coxon has semi-jokingly referred to this tour as \"my therapy\" and is clearly relishing the chance to get out of himself (and his Blur persona) and return to venues he grew up in. </p> <p>Having failed to shake off an awkwardness with fame by guzzling alcohol, Coxon has turned to something stronger: unfeasibly loud, American- influenced punk rock. Coxon's homage to punk obscurities such as Mission of Burma and the Meat Puppets could be seen as a rock star showing off his leftfield credentials. But he genuinely loves this music. Assembling a fearsome band (Blur's drummer Dave Rowntree, along with guitarists from Idlewild and unknowns Thirteen Thirteen), Coxon's excursions sound like punk-grunge should: fabulously tight and exceedingly rough. It's actually a compliment to say that on the phobia- confronting The Fear they recall a drunk being attacked by a swarm of bees. </p> <p>That this isn't a \"solo career\" intended to be taken seriously is underlined when Coxon howls with laughter as the cymbal stand almost crashes over. And yet, the untold emotion he puts into Mission of Burma's Fame &amp; Fortune shows that there is sincerity behind the tomfoolery. </p> <p>As a frontman, Coxon makes a fabulous guitarist. Adjusting the microphone stand so he can stare at the floor, he introduces one song as \"er about er goats\" and another, wearily, as being about \"adolescent persecution complexes\". The ensuing Leave me Alone may be discordant, but only a cold heart could fail to warm to Coxon's sense of the ridiculous. </p> <p>Following the hypnotic, Joy Division groove of The Lake, he exits the stage the wrong way. Looking up in mock horror at the chuckling audience, he buries his head in his hands and howls, before running off to the sanctity of the tour bus. </p> <p>Graham Coxon plays the Garage, London N5 (020-7607 1818) tomorrow and Saturday. </p>",

However, Coxon has semi-jokingly referred to this tour as \"my therapy\" and is clearly relishing the chance to get out of himself (and his Blur persona) and return to venues he grew up in. Having failed to shake off an awkwardness with fame by guzzling alcohol, Coxon has turned to something stronger: unfeasibly loud, American- influenced punk rock. Coxon's homage to punk obscurities such as Mission of Burma and the Meat Puppets could be seen as a rock star showing off his leftfield credentials. But he genuinely loves this music. Assembling a fearsome band (Blur's drummer Dave Rowntree, along with guitarists from Idlewild and unknowns Thirteen Thirteen), Coxon's excursions sound like punk-grunge should: fabulously tight and exceedingly rough. It's actually a compliment to say that on the phobia- confronting The Fear they recall a drunk being attacked by a swarm of bees. That this isn't a \"solo career\" intended to be taken seriously is underlined when Coxon howls with laughter as the cymbal stand almost crashes over. And yet, the untold emotion he puts into Mission of Burma's Fame &amp; Fortune shows that there is sincerity behind the tomfoolery. As a frontman, Coxon makes a fabulous guitarist. Adjusting the microphone stand so he can stare at the floor, he introduces one song as \"er about er goats\" and another, wearily, as being about \"adolescent persecution complexes\". The ensuing Leave me Alone may be discordant, but only a cold heart could fail to warm to Coxon's sense of the ridiculous. Following the hypnotic, Joy Division groove of The Lake, he exits the stage the wrong way. Looking up in mock horror at the chuckling audience, he buries his head in his hands and howls, before running off to the sanctity of the tour bus. Graham Coxon plays the Garage, London N5 (020-7607 1818) tomorrow and Saturday.",

      "body": "<p>I missed David Haig's first play, My Boy Jack, at Hampstead Theatre. His second one, dealing with the dangerous involvement between a posh Samaritans volunteer and a sexy suicide case, is an informative, intelligent work - the kind of linear, issue- raising play that people allegedly don't write any more. </p> <p>Haig's hero, Alan, is a married publisher with three children who spends his spare time manning help-lines for the Samaritans. But although Alan's wife works alongside him, his downward spiral begins when the desperate, knife-bearing Carol bursts into her local Samaritans centre. Alan establishes a rapport with her through a shared passion for Bob Dylan: she, against all the rules, becomes dependent on him. What follows is a study in mutual obsession that raises a key question: how do you avoid personal involvement when you are trying to save lives? </p> <p>You could easily find fault with Haig's play. Facts, such as that 35% of Samaritan callers are silent, are blandly peddled. The flaws in Alan's marriage are never really explained. And a major scene, in which Alan and Carol achieve erotic ecstasy without touching, is eerily reminiscent of an episode in Martin Sherman's play, Bent. But Haig plausibly shows how the altruistic liberalism that drives people like Alan to do voluntary work also leaves them curiously exposed. </p> <p>Conventionally reared, Alan is clearly turned on by Carol's south London sassiness and emotional vulnerability. It's an old point, dating back to Mr Gladstone's remedial work with London prostitutes, but a valid one: that do-gooding is inseparable from sex, and that helpers are often the ones most in need of attention. </p> <p>But Haig, an ex-Samaritan, raises these doubts without undermining the principle of voluntary work. And, in John Dove's alert production, his play comes fiercely alive in the bruising confrontations between Alan and Carol. </p> <p>Partly, it's a matter of class. Julian Wadham has just the right too-good-to-be-true quality of a smooth man who knows a bit about everything. But the revelation is Claudie Blakley. She gives a brilliantly accurate portrayal of a working-class mother who is shrewd, sexy, manipulative but also aware that life has dealt her a series of dud hands. Jane Gurnett does all she can with the underwritten role of Alan's wife. </p> <p>The real thrill comes from the Wadham-Blakley encounters in which Haig mercilessly exposes the weaknesses of the public-school liberal who suddenly discovers himself a slave to passion. </p> <p> Until August 26.

      "bodyText": "I missed David Haig's first play, My Boy Jack, at Hampstead Theatre. His second one, dealing with the dangerous involvement between a posh Samaritans volunteer and a sexy suicide case, is an informative, intelligent work - the kind of linear, issue- raising play that people allegedly don't write any more. Haig's hero, Alan, is a married publisher with three children who spends his spare time manning help-lines for the Samaritans. But although Alan's wife works alongside him, his downward spiral begins when the desperate, knife-bearing Carol bursts into her local Samaritans centre. Alan establishes a rapport with her through a shared passion for Bob Dylan: she, against all the rules, becomes dependent on him. What follows is a study in mutual obsession that raises a key question: how do you avoid personal involvement when you are trying to save lives? You could easily find fault with Haig's play. Facts, such as that 35% of Samaritan callers are silent, are blandly peddled. The flaws in Alan's marriage are never really explained. And a major scene, in which Alan and Carol achieve erotic ecstasy without touching, is eerily reminiscent of an episode in Martin Sherman's play, Bent. But Haig plausibly shows how the altruistic liberalism that drives people like Alan to do voluntary work also leaves them curiously exposed. Conventionally reared, Alan is clearly turned on by Carol's south London sassiness and emotional vulnerability. It's an old point, dating back to Mr Gladstone's remedial work with London prostitutes, but a valid one: that do-gooding is inseparable from sex, and that helpers are often the ones most in need of attention. But Haig, an ex-Samaritan, raises these doubts without undermining the principle of voluntary work. And, in John Dove's alert production, his play comes fiercely alive in the bruising confrontations between Alan and Carol. Partly, it's a matter of class. Julian Wadham has just the right too-good-to-be-true quality of a smooth man who knows a bit about everything. But the revelation is Claudie Blakley. She gives a brilliantly accurate portrayal of a working-class mother who is shrewd, sexy, manipulative but also aware that life has dealt her a series of dud hands. Jane Gurnett does all she can with the underwritten role of Alan's wife. The real thrill comes from the Wadham-Blakley encounters in which Haig mercilessly exposes the weaknesses of the public-school liberal who suddenly discovers himself a slave to passion. Until August 26. Box office: 020-7722 9301.",

      "byline": "Matthew Engel",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Dominic Cork returned to the England team in triumph at Lord's after a long period in exile, having been scorned as divisive and difficult. The views of the most divisive and difficult cricketer of them all were not vouchsafed to most of us. </p> <p>Geoff Boycott apparently spent the game working for TalkSport, the station now relegated back to obscurity, having spent the series in South Africa always mentioning its sponsors but only occasionally the score. I also thought I caught a snatch of him giving a mini-pontification on Radio 5 Live. From the mainstream cricket media he remains barred, the upshot of the court case in 1998 when he was convicted by a French court for assaulting one of his lovers, Margaret Moore, who said he hit her at least 20 times during a row in a French hotel bedroom. </p> <p>Channel 4 employs various analysts not fit to blanco his boots as players, or polish his microphone as broadcasters, but Boycott stays unselected. Over the past few days, however, a campaign has been gathering momentum to free the Fitzwilliam One. It began with a piece by Boycott's biographer, Leo McKinstry, in the Spectator, complaining that his conviction was \"an outrage\" and his banishment from the commentary box \"an ever greater disgrace\". </p> <p>\"Margaret Moore was given damages of one franc after the trial,\" wrote McKinstry. \"Boycott appears to have been handed a life sentence.\" His call was taken up on Saturday by the Daily Mail's star columnist Ian Wooldridge, who called the article \"a masterpiece\" and said: \"I know Boycott was not guilty of the offence as charged and, had he hit Miss Moore 20 times, he would have killed her.\" </p> <p>\"Masterpiece\" is pushing it a bit, though the article was a pretty smart way for McKinstry to plug his book (Boycs: The True Story, Partridge Press, \u00a316.99). The book is, in any case, worth plugging for its own merits. It is well researched and well written but above all fair-minded and balanced (pause for joke about Boycott having a chip on both shoulders). This is rare indeed when it comes to this subject who, as a player, divided people into lovers and haters like no one of his era save his heroine Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>It is hard now, when county cricket seems so drab, even to remember the tempests that roared round Yorkshire when Boycott was playing. But everyone agrees he is a brilliant broadcaster, where his persona, as McKinstry puts it, is the exact opposite of his dreary batting: \"Passionate, animated, daring\". I think they are two sides of the same coin. </p> <p>Boycott mastered the craft of commentary as carefully as he did batting, and evolved his technique in the same studied manner - he decided the way to carve out a career as a commentator was to take risks and play shots, which he often does brilliantly. It is also hard to remember now that he was one of England's worst ever captains - but then that goes for several others still in business. </p> <p>Boycott was fatuously casual about the French judicial system, which led to his downfall. His near-comical arrogance and his insularity made him easy for the judge to convict. But, as McKinstry says, a lump on the forehead and a bit of bruising are an improbable outcome of 20 blows. And a study of Moore's behaviour after the case - first attempting desperately to stay in touch with Boycott, then apparently trying to sell her story for \u00a31m - hardly suggests to me a convincingly pathetic victim. No one knows what goes on in another couple's bedroom but I find it hard to imagine that any jury could have thought the case proved beyond reasonable doubt. </p> <p>He has been arrested before, you know. For reasons that were obscure enough at the time, never mind now, Boycott was placed under house arrest in 1986 in Trinidad in company with the then-Guardian cricket correspondent for non-possession of a work permit. This fails to make McKinstry's biography, though I have dined out on the story ever since. </p> <p>Having thus shared a bedroom with Boycott, I have to say he behaved impeccably, and very peaceably, towards me. I am not so sure I would be so trusting about Miss Moore. Guilty or not, Boycott has been punished by the court. It is time for cricket to rehabilitate him.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Dominic Cork returned to the England team in triumph at Lord's after a long period in exile, having been scorned as divisive and difficult. The views of the most divisive and difficult cricketer of them all were not vouchsafed to most of us. Geoff Boycott apparently spent the game working for TalkSport, the station now relegated back to obscurity, having spent the series in South Africa always mentioning its sponsors but only occasionally the score. I also thought I caught a snatch of him giving a mini-pontification on Radio 5 Live. From the mainstream cricket media he remains barred, the upshot of the court case in 1998 when he was convicted by a French court for assaulting one of his lovers, Margaret Moore, who said he hit her at least 20 times during a row in a French hotel bedroom. Channel 4 employs various analysts not fit to blanco his boots as players, or polish his microphone as broadcasters, but Boycott stays unselected. Over the past few days, however, a campaign has been gathering momentum to free the Fitzwilliam One. It began with a piece by Boycott's biographer, Leo McKinstry, in the Spectator, complaining that his conviction was \"an outrage\" and his banishment from the commentary box \"an ever greater disgrace\". \"Margaret Moore was given damages of one franc after the trial,\" wrote McKinstry. \"Boycott appears to have been handed a life sentence.\" His call was taken up on Saturday by the Daily Mail's star columnist Ian Wooldridge, who called the article \"a masterpiece\" and said: \"I know Boycott was not guilty of the offence as charged and, had he hit Miss Moore 20 times, he would have killed her.\" \"Masterpiece\" is pushing it a bit, though the article was a pretty smart way for McKinstry to plug his book (Boycs: The True Story, Partridge Press, \u00a316.99). The book is, in any case, worth plugging for its own merits. It is well researched and well written but above all fair-minded and balanced (pause for joke about Boycott having a chip on both shoulders). This is rare indeed when it comes to this subject who, as a player, divided people into lovers and haters like no one of his era save his heroine Margaret Thatcher. It is hard now, when county cricket seems so drab, even to remember the tempests that roared round Yorkshire when Boycott was playing. But everyone agrees he is a brilliant broadcaster, where his persona, as McKinstry puts it, is the exact opposite of his dreary batting: \"Passionate, animated, daring\". I think they are two sides of the same coin. Boycott mastered the craft of commentary as carefully as he did batting, and evolved his technique in the same studied manner - he decided the way to carve out a career as a commentator was to take risks and play shots, which he often does brilliantly. It is also hard to remember now that he was one of England's worst ever captains - but then that goes for several others still in business. Boycott was fatuously casual about the French judicial system, which led to his downfall. His near-comical arrogance and his insularity made him easy for the judge to convict. But, as McKinstry says, a lump on the forehead and a bit of bruising are an improbable outcome of 20 blows. And a study of Moore's behaviour after the case - first attempting desperately to stay in touch with Boycott, then apparently trying to sell her story for \u00a31m - hardly suggests to me a convincingly pathetic victim. No one knows what goes on in another couple's bedroom but I find it hard to imagine that any jury could have thought the case proved beyond reasonable doubt. He has been arrested before, you know. For reasons that were obscure enough at the time, never mind now, Boycott was placed under house arrest in 1986 in Trinidad in company with the then-Guardian cricket correspondent for non-possession of a work permit. This fails to make McKinstry's biography, though I have dined out on the story ever since. Having thus shared a bedroom with Boycott, I have to say he behaved impeccably, and very peaceably, towards me. I am not so sure I would be so trusting about Miss Moore. Guilty or not, Boycott has been punished by the court. It is time for cricket to rehabilitate him.",

As we forge into the 21st century with an ageing population unprecedented in the history of mankind, what attitudes do we have to work and older age? </p> <p>For many people in the third world, retirement is not an option. In the developed world, the state pension age is edging upwards as governments struggle to restrain the growth of pension expenditure. While encouraging people to work longer may be official policy, the prevalence of age discrimination in employment remains a real concern and the number of men in active, paid-for employment has tumbled in the past two decades. </p> <p>Winning the Generation Game, a report from the government's performance and innovation unit, earlier this year addressed some of these issues. It pointed to a macro-economic need for more people to work for more years and proposed a raft of retraining measures and social security reforms to support this policy. It also discussed the value of work, including voluntary work, to the individual. At that individual level, too, the option of retiring on a decent pension is perhaps receding. </p> <p>There is growing pressure to improve the state pension: it desperately needs improvement since it now represents less than 15% of average earnings. Occupational pensions, hailed as the success story of the last century, are under strain from increasing longevity and falling annuity rates - let alone the spread of defined contribution schemes. Since second tier pensions still remain optional in this country, many people make no contribution to one at all. For them, some \"little jobs\" may be of real importance in older age. </p> <p>Too readily, in employment and other fields, we dismiss older people as of little worth or importance. Shrinking from legislation, the government introduced a code of practice for employers, but this shows no sign of changing attitudes substantially. John Brown's dad refused to be bowed by age discrimination, and his story shows the positive value of active ageing.</p> <p>\u0095 Mervyn Kohler is head of public affairs at Help the Aged</p>",

For many people in the third world, retirement is not an option. In the developed world, the state pension age is edging upwards as governments struggle to restrain the growth of pension expenditure. While encouraging people to work longer may be official policy, the prevalence of age discrimination in employment remains a real concern and the number of men in active, paid-for employment has tumbled in the past two decades. Winning the Generation Game, a report from the government's performance and innovation unit, earlier this year addressed some of these issues. It pointed to a macro-economic need for more people to work for more years and proposed a raft of retraining measures and social security reforms to support this policy. It also discussed the value of work, including voluntary work, to the individual. At that individual level, too, the option of retiring on a decent pension is perhaps receding. There is growing pressure to improve the state pension: it desperately needs improvement since it now represents less than 15% of average earnings. Occupational pensions, hailed as the success story of the last century, are under strain from increasing longevity and falling annuity rates - let alone the spread of defined contribution schemes. Since second tier pensions still remain optional in this country, many people make no contribution to one at all. For them, some \"little jobs\" may be of real importance in older age. Too readily, in employment and other fields, we dismiss older people as of little worth or importance. Shrinking from legislation, the government introduced a code of practice for employers, but this shows no sign of changing attitudes substantially. John Brown's dad refused to be bowed by age discrimination, and his story shows the positive value of active ageing. \u0095 Mervyn Kohler is head of public affairs at Help the Aged",

      "trailText": "<B> Demanding</B><BR>",
      "byline": "Nick Davies",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b> Demanding</b> <br> <p> For example, the Dutch reject the idea that all children should move up a grade or sit their exams at the same age. They recognise that some children will take longer to reach agreed goals and so they allow grade-repetition in attempt to ensure that as many as possible reach the same minimum standards sooner or later. Prof Meijnen says that nationally up to 15% of primary pupils and 30% of secondary pupils repeat a year. Pupils in this country can do the same in exceptional circumstances, but for the most part they are pushed unthinkingly forwards, trapping them in their failure at every stage. </p> <p>The Dutch recognise that a child who is held back for a year may feel like a failure but they argue that they can mitigate this (particularly when so many others are being held back) and that this is a lesser evil than processing an unprepared child through a more demanding syllabus that will condemn it to accumulating failure, ending in an eary departure from education. The classic example is of children who arrive in secondary school without being able to read and who simply cannot do the work. Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Austria, Greece and Belgium all encourage varying degrees of grade-repetition. Why not Britain? </p> <p>In Britain, this processing by age is aggravated by an exam system, from which the Dutch also suffer, that is based on norms and not criteria. What this means is that each year, examiners establish a pass mark - a norm - which guarantees that a proportion of children will fail. (This is all about \"gold standards\"). A criterion-based exam sets a minimum standard and allows every child to pass; some of them can score distinctions. Why do we cling to the norm-based version? </p> <p>The combined effect of these two features of our system is not merely to allow failure but positively to insist on it. Politicians express their horror at the rate of failure without seeing that they are presiding over a system that guarantees it as a structural requirement - with all the damage that inflicts on the children who suffer as a result. </p> <p>An even more striking feature of the Dutch needs-based system is funding. The money supply to Britain's schools is notoriously unsatisfactory. Each student attracts a basic sum of money, but there are bizarre disparities between neighbouring areas; and the formulas for adding extra money for various special needs (students who cannot speak English, who come from poor families, who have special educational needs) is inadequate in its total and inaccurate in its targeting. In the Netherlands, all funding is systematically moulded to need. </p> <p>In Dutch primary schools, each student attracts a basic unit of funding, but those whose parents have a low level of education get 1.25 of this unit; the children of bargees get 1.4; children of migrants and travellers get 1.7; children of ethnic minorities with a low level of education get 1.9. No local disparities, no unreliable extras: this is core funding. In secondary schools, vocational students attract more money than academic ones because their workshops are more expensive to clean and maintain. A typical Dutch secondary school spends 2,537 guilders (\u00a3730) running a course for each of its vocational students and only 764 guilders on each of its top band of academic students. </p> <p>The right abhors the idea of needs-based funding as a reward for failure that tends to siphon money away from high-achieving middle-class children towards the poor. The Dutch, however, having negotiated these political rapids, can now point to real evidence that they are overcoming the inheritance of educational disadvantage. Their education ministry points out that the number of children eligible for 1.25 funding, as the offspring of parents with low education, is falling sharply. </p> <p><b> Nightmare</b><br> </p> <p> Pulling together these themes, a thought that dare not speak its name emerges: that we might reconsider the value of selection. The British experience of selective education was a nightmare - arbitrary in assigning children on the basis of a single exam at the age of 11; inflexible in allowing only the scarcest chance of escape; unfair in assigning extra resources to the children with the greatest ability; and all of it polluted by the politics of class, since overwhelmingly it was the children of the poor who tended to end up trapped in the second-class schools. </p> <p>The most striking feature of the Dutch system is that they have worked assiduously to develop a structure that in the UK is synonymous with elitism - precisely in order to avoid elitism. It is a conscious act of social justice. It is not perfect, but in principle they have thought their way through the paradox of equal educational opportunity. The selective system is really the logical outcome of the rest of their needs-based system. </p> <p>Dutch students on a vocational pathway will find that more than half their time table is devoted to these subjects; therefore, they are separate from the academic students. But in the academic remainder of their timetable, they also will be separate so that they can move at their own speed instead of being forced to fail at the rate of the more able students. And so they are separate - but within the same schools. The question is whether this amounts to the same arbitrary, inflexible and second-class system that afflicted this country. The answer is that the Dutch have almost cracked it. </p> <p>All Dutch children go through the same non-selective primary schools, repeating a year if they need to. They then go through an assessment process that is far more sophisticated than our old 11-plus. They sit tests in intelligence and/or achievement; staff produce written reports, all of them are discussed; the headteacher talks to the parents and then produces a recommendation to the secondary school. As they enter secondary school, pupils are divided into four pathways, all within the same school, each studying the same 15 subjects from the same books but at four different levels and speeds. Each pathway runs for two years. </p> <p>Crucially, if schools discover that the primary school's assessment was wrong, they will transfer children to a different pathway at the end of either of these first two years. Up to 25% of children do so. After two years, these four pathways take radically different routes. About 15% of the children take the most demanding academic route, which lasts a further four years; 25% take the slightly less demanding academic route, which takes three years; 45% take a two-year academic route that includes some practical vocational work; and the remaining 15% take an essentially vocational pathway with some academic extras for two years. As a further key element of flexibility, students can finish one pathway, take a diploma and then continue their secondary schooling by moving across to a more academic one. Some 5% do so. </p> <p>In other words, whereas the old British system of selection encased children in pathways, the Dutch one encourages movement between them. Supported by vocational lessons, Dutch schools invite the failing child, first to succeed at its own level; and then, where appropriate, to move on to a higher level. JJ Molenaar, the headteacher of Martinus College in Grootebroek in the north-east Netherlands, says: \"It is a structural way of drawing in the children of the poor.\" And here is the key statistic: at the end of their vocational pathway, 94% of these least academically able students pass exams for a diploma in six subjects, some of them academic. Compare that with our startling rates of failure. And this is not about the exams being easy: wiring a bathroom is inherently no easier than learning Latin. </p> <p>But even if the Dutch structure avoids being arbitrary and inflexible, has it nevertheless created a system with two classes of education? Dutch schools acknowledge that there is a residual problem of stigma. At Tabor school, Henk Verreijen says: \"Ask any parent, they will hope their children will become professors.\" This latent stigma is aggravated by the fact that, to attract graduates, the top academic pathway pays its teachers more than the rest. The pay differential is worth about 2,000 guilders a month (\u00a3575). One vocational teacher says: \"Yes, it does irritate me. But not every day.\" </p> <p>Against this, the Dutch have done a lot to reduce the stigma. Some of this is cultural. With that striking Dutch affection for common sense, headteacher Dr Molenaar says: \"We need a lawyer once or twice in a lifetime. But we need a baker every day.\" Some of it is social: the schools use outings and the staging of drama to bring together students from different pathways. (Their schools provide virtually no sport, the other obvious opportunity for the mixing of pupils.) </p> <p>Most of all, the attack on stigma comes from the needs-based education policy, which feeds more money to the vocational pathways and therefore more esteem, and which provides a real chance of success and so secures more approval from parents and employers alike. Recently, the education ministry has tried to raise esteem still further by merging the pathways for the two least able groups to allow more of these children to study more academic subjects if they wish. </p> <p>Even if the Dutch have got it more or less right, would it be right to dilute our comprehensive system? There are two points. The first is that, as we have seen earlier in this series, with the exception of secondary schools in particularly well-mixed communities, this country no longer has comprehensive schools. The reality is that, under pressure from middle-class parents and Kenneth Baker's Tory market reforms, most of them have slipped back into a divided system, in effect of grammar and secondary modern schools, with the additional disadvantage that selection now is by estate agent, with middle-class parents buying their way into the catchment area of the new \"grammar\" schools. </p> <p>The second point is that there is one respect in which the Dutch look across the North Sea with envy: we have a comprehensive infrastructure. Their worst problem is that even though their different pathways are within the same schools, they are still scattered across their communities on different sites. Each tends to become home to a different pathway, which exaggerates the separation between the different students and makes transfers more difficult. They would like to start where we already are - with a comprehensive infrastructure that would allow them to run their different pathways under one roof. </p> <p>But, even if we all agreed that we should rearrange our comprehensives into selective pathways, the future here would not be as easy as that. Even if the DfEE learned to think the unthinkable, even if all the detritus of the national curriculum and the league tables and the GNVQ and the whole strategy of confusion were cast into the dustbin of history, there would still be a problem - arguably the most significant problem in our system. Class politics. </p> <p>Just look back to the 1944 Education Act, which created the disaster of our selective system. On paper, it was no disaster at all. This was a system designed to deliver different education to satisfy different children, which foresaw a whole pathway of vocational learning in technical colleges that would sit alongside the secondary moderns and the grammars, all of them enjoying \"parity of esteem\". It was always likely to be arbitrary and inflexible, but the vision disintegrated because the technical colleges, with their working-class intake, either failed to materialise or were merged with other types of school; and the grammar schools, with their middle-class intake, hogged the best of the funding. </p> <p>Britain is the most unequal society in western Europe. In the first part of this series, we quoted a 1999 Treasury report: \"Going to school does not reduce the differences in early development between advantaged and disadvantaged children.\" That line encapsulates more than 50 years of failure - of grammar schools and secondary moderns, of comprehensives and of market places. Equally, it represents a triumph for class politics, for the power of the British middle-class to corner what is best for its children, much of it disguised as the exercise of parental choice, as though that did not involve the exercise of power by the financially strong, buying their way into attractive catchment areas and the private sector. </p> <p>This government has produced some good initiatives. An outstanding example is the Sure Start scheme, to build a bridge into school for infants from poor families, which may well make a real difference, but it lives in a chaos of educational improvisation, a strategy dismembered by political compromise. There are very senior figures in the Department for Education who believe that Chris Woodhead has discredited Ofsted, and yet he has been left in his job. There is overwhelming evidence to destroy the 1980s Tory claim that the primary cause of school failure is incompetent teachers with \"trendy teaching techniques\", and yet that analysis has been left in place, to distort all subsequent policy on school improvement. Kenneth Baker's reforms are clearly causing structural havoc, and yet his entire package has been left intact. Private schools are skimming bright children off the top of the state system and yet they have been left unchallenged, together with the state subsidy of their charitable status. </p> <p><b> Underfunding</b><br> </p> <p> Every level of education has been crying out for new money to reverse the chronic underfunding of the Tory years, and yet - as we revealed in March - the \u00a319bn they were promised by Mr Blunkett has turned out to be a concoction of book-keeping tricks, disguising the impact of conservative fiscal policy. Schools all over the north suffer special financial penalities because of the bizarre local weighting of their funding, and yet the system has been left untouched for fear of alienating the electorally powerful south-east, which would lose money in any reform. All of these fundamental and deeply damaging decisions have been made not for any educational reason but purely and simply to appease the right. </p> <p>The education department's reluctance to go back to the basic problems and to think the unthinkable reflects more than mere lack of imagination and absence of intellectual energy. It is part of a deep- seated political retreat. There is plenty of politics in British education, but it is not the politics of enlightenment, not the injection of moral strategy or social justice into public life, but the eye-scratching, shirt-pulling, snickering, bickering, sneering silliness of the parliamentary playground. </p> <p>As things stand, any attempt to introduce into our comprehensive schools the kind of selective pathways that have been pioneered by the Dutch would be vulnerable to being kidnapped and mutilated. So long as the people at the top of the Department for Education behave like intellectual quislings, appeasing the enemies of social justice in education, they will not think the unthinkable, or fight the real battles, and they will not save the schools from failure, and they will not help some of the most disadvantaged children in Europe. </p> <p> Additional research by Helene Mulholland </p> <p><b>Useful links: </b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.teachers.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">NUT</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.sha.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Secondary Heads Association</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.teach-tta.gov.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Teacher Training Agency</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.dfee.gov.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">DfEE</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Demanding For example, the Dutch reject the idea that all children should move up a grade or sit their exams at the same age. They recognise that some children will take longer to reach agreed goals and so they allow grade-repetition in attempt to ensure that as many as possible reach the same minimum standards sooner or later. Prof Meijnen says that nationally up to 15% of primary pupils and 30% of secondary pupils repeat a year. Pupils in this country can do the same in exceptional circumstances, but for the most part they are pushed unthinkingly forwards, trapping them in their failure at every stage. The Dutch recognise that a child who is held back for a year may feel like a failure but they argue that they can mitigate this (particularly when so many others are being held back) and that this is a lesser evil than processing an unprepared child through a more demanding syllabus that will condemn it to accumulating failure, ending in an eary departure from education. The classic example is of children who arrive in secondary school without being able to read and who simply cannot do the work. Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Austria, Greece and Belgium all encourage varying degrees of grade-repetition. Why not Britain? In Britain, this processing by age is aggravated by an exam system, from which the Dutch also suffer, that is based on norms and not criteria. What this means is that each year, examiners establish a pass mark - a norm - which guarantees that a proportion of children will fail. (This is all about \"gold standards\"). A criterion-based exam sets a minimum standard and allows every child to pass; some of them can score distinctions. Why do we cling to the norm-based version? The combined effect of these two features of our system is not merely to allow failure but positively to insist on it. Politicians express their horror at the rate of failure without seeing that they are presiding over a system that guarantees it as a structural requirement - with all the damage that inflicts on the children who suffer as a result. An even more striking feature of the Dutch needs-based system is funding. The money supply to Britain's schools is notoriously unsatisfactory. Each student attracts a basic sum of money, but there are bizarre disparities between neighbouring areas; and the formulas for adding extra money for various special needs (students who cannot speak English, who come from poor families, who have special educational needs) is inadequate in its total and inaccurate in its targeting. In the Netherlands, all funding is systematically moulded to need. In Dutch primary schools, each student attracts a basic unit of funding, but those whose parents have a low level of education get 1.25 of this unit; the children of bargees get 1.4; children of migrants and travellers get 1.7; children of ethnic minorities with a low level of education get 1.9. No local disparities, no unreliable extras: this is core funding. In secondary schools, vocational students attract more money than academic ones because their workshops are more expensive to clean and maintain. A typical Dutch secondary school spends 2,537 guilders (\u00a3730) running a course for each of its vocational students and only 764 guilders on each of its top band of academic students. The right abhors the idea of needs-based funding as a reward for failure that tends to siphon money away from high-achieving middle-class children towards the poor. The Dutch, however, having negotiated these political rapids, can now point to real evidence that they are overcoming the inheritance of educational disadvantage. Their education ministry points out that the number of children eligible for 1.25 funding, as the offspring of parents with low education, is falling sharply. Nightmare Pulling together these themes, a thought that dare not speak its name emerges: that we might reconsider the value of selection. The British experience of selective education was a nightmare - arbitrary in assigning children on the basis of a single exam at the age of 11; inflexible in allowing only the scarcest chance of escape; unfair in assigning extra resources to the children with the greatest ability; and all of it polluted by the politics of class, since overwhelmingly it was the children of the poor who tended to end up trapped in the second-class schools. The most striking feature of the Dutch system is that they have worked assiduously to develop a structure that in the UK is synonymous with elitism - precisely in order to avoid elitism. It is a conscious act of social justice. It is not perfect, but in principle they have thought their way through the paradox of equal educational opportunity. The selective system is really the logical outcome of the rest of their needs-based system. Dutch students on a vocational pathway will find that more than half their time table is devoted to these subjects; therefore, they are separate from the academic students. But in the academic remainder of their timetable, they also will be separate so that they can move at their own speed instead of being forced to fail at the rate of the more able students. And so they are separate - but within the same schools. The question is whether this amounts to the same arbitrary, inflexible and second-class system that afflicted this country. The answer is that the Dutch have almost cracked it. All Dutch children go through the same non-selective primary schools, repeating a year if they need to. They then go through an assessment process that is far more sophisticated than our old 11-plus. They sit tests in intelligence and/or achievement; staff produce written reports, all of them are discussed; the headteacher talks to the parents and then produces a recommendation to the secondary school. As they enter secondary school, pupils are divided into four pathways, all within the same school, each studying the same 15 subjects from the same books but at four different levels and speeds. Each pathway runs for two years. Crucially, if schools discover that the primary school's assessment was wrong, they will transfer children to a different pathway at the end of either of these first two years. Up to 25% of children do so. After two years, these four pathways take radically different routes. About 15% of the children take the most demanding academic route, which lasts a further four years; 25% take the slightly less demanding academic route, which takes three years; 45% take a two-year academic route that includes some practical vocational work; and the remaining 15% take an essentially vocational pathway with some academic extras for two years. As a further key element of flexibility, students can finish one pathway, take a diploma and then continue their secondary schooling by moving across to a more academic one. Some 5% do so. In other words, whereas the old British system of selection encased children in pathways, the Dutch one encourages movement between them. Supported by vocational lessons, Dutch schools invite the failing child, first to succeed at its own level; and then, where appropriate, to move on to a higher level. JJ Molenaar, the headteacher of Martinus College in Grootebroek in the north-east Netherlands, says: \"It is a structural way of drawing in the children of the poor.\" And here is the key statistic: at the end of their vocational pathway, 94% of these least academically able students pass exams for a diploma in six subjects, some of them academic. Compare that with our startling rates of failure. And this is not about the exams being easy: wiring a bathroom is inherently no easier than learning Latin. But even if the Dutch structure avoids being arbitrary and inflexible, has it nevertheless created a system with two classes of education? Dutch schools acknowledge that there is a residual problem of stigma. At Tabor school, Henk Verreijen says: \"Ask any parent, they will hope their children will become professors.\" This latent stigma is aggravated by the fact that, to attract graduates, the top academic pathway pays its teachers more than the rest. The pay differential is worth about 2,000 guilders a month (\u00a3575). One vocational teacher says: \"Yes, it does irritate me. But not every day.\" Against this, the Dutch have done a lot to reduce the stigma. Some of this is cultural. With that striking Dutch affection for common sense, headteacher Dr Molenaar says: \"We need a lawyer once or twice in a lifetime. But we need a baker every day.\" Some of it is social: the schools use outings and the staging of drama to bring together students from different pathways. (Their schools provide virtually no sport, the other obvious opportunity for the mixing of pupils.) Most of all, the attack on stigma comes from the needs-based education policy, which feeds more money to the vocational pathways and therefore more esteem, and which provides a real chance of success and so secures more approval from parents and employers alike. Recently, the education ministry has tried to raise esteem still further by merging the pathways for the two least able groups to allow more of these children to study more academic subjects if they wish. Even if the Dutch have got it more or less right, would it be right to dilute our comprehensive system? There are two points. The first is that, as we have seen earlier in this series, with the exception of secondary schools in particularly well-mixed communities, this country no longer has comprehensive schools. The reality is that, under pressure from middle-class parents and Kenneth Baker's Tory market reforms, most of them have slipped back into a divided system, in effect of grammar and secondary modern schools, with the additional disadvantage that selection now is by estate agent, with middle-class parents buying their way into the catchment area of the new \"grammar\" schools. The second point is that there is one respect in which the Dutch look across the North Sea with envy: we have a comprehensive infrastructure. Their worst problem is that even though their different pathways are within the same schools, they are still scattered across their communities on different sites. Each tends to become home to a different pathway, which exaggerates the separation between the different students and makes transfers more difficult. They would like to start where we already are - with a comprehensive infrastructure that would allow them to run their different pathways under one roof. But, even if we all agreed that we should rearrange our comprehensives into selective pathways, the future here would not be as easy as that. Even if the DfEE learned to think the unthinkable, even if all the detritus of the national curriculum and the league tables and the GNVQ and the whole strategy of confusion were cast into the dustbin of history, there would still be a problem - arguably the most significant problem in our system. Class politics. Just look back to the 1944 Education Act, which created the disaster of our selective system. On paper, it was no disaster at all. This was a system designed to deliver different education to satisfy different children, which foresaw a whole pathway of vocational learning in technical colleges that would sit alongside the secondary moderns and the grammars, all of them enjoying \"parity of esteem\". It was always likely to be arbitrary and inflexible, but the vision disintegrated because the technical colleges, with their working-class intake, either failed to materialise or were merged with other types of school; and the grammar schools, with their middle-class intake, hogged the best of the funding. Britain is the most unequal society in western Europe. In the first part of this series, we quoted a 1999 Treasury report: \"Going to school does not reduce the differences in early development between advantaged and disadvantaged children.\" That line encapsulates more than 50 years of failure - of grammar schools and secondary moderns, of comprehensives and of market places. Equally, it represents a triumph for class politics, for the power of the British middle-class to corner what is best for its children, much of it disguised as the exercise of parental choice, as though that did not involve the exercise of power by the financially strong, buying their way into attractive catchment areas and the private sector. This government has produced some good initiatives. An outstanding example is the Sure Start scheme, to build a bridge into school for infants from poor families, which may well make a real difference, but it lives in a chaos of educational improvisation, a strategy dismembered by political compromise. There are very senior figures in the Department for Education who believe that Chris Woodhead has discredited Ofsted, and yet he has been left in his job. There is overwhelming evidence to destroy the 1980s Tory claim that the primary cause of school failure is incompetent teachers with \"trendy teaching techniques\", and yet that analysis has been left in place, to distort all subsequent policy on school improvement. Kenneth Baker's reforms are clearly causing structural havoc, and yet his entire package has been left intact. Private schools are skimming bright children off the top of the state system and yet they have been left unchallenged, together with the state subsidy of their charitable status. Underfunding Every level of education has been crying out for new money to reverse the chronic underfunding of the Tory years, and yet - as we revealed in March - the \u00a319bn they were promised by Mr Blunkett has turned out to be a concoction of book-keeping tricks, disguising the impact of conservative fiscal policy. Schools all over the north suffer special financial penalities because of the bizarre local weighting of their funding, and yet the system has been left untouched for fear of alienating the electorally powerful south-east, which would lose money in any reform. All of these fundamental and deeply damaging decisions have been made not for any educational reason but purely and simply to appease the right. The education department's reluctance to go back to the basic problems and to think the unthinkable reflects more than mere lack of imagination and absence of intellectual energy. It is part of a deep- seated political retreat. There is plenty of politics in British education, but it is not the politics of enlightenment, not the injection of moral strategy or social justice into public life, but the eye-scratching, shirt-pulling, snickering, bickering, sneering silliness of the parliamentary playground. As things stand, any attempt to introduce into our comprehensive schools the kind of selective pathways that have been pioneered by the Dutch would be vulnerable to being kidnapped and mutilated. So long as the people at the top of the Department for Education behave like intellectual quislings, appeasing the enemies of social justice in education, they will not think the unthinkable, or fight the real battles, and they will not save the schools from failure, and they will not help some of the most disadvantaged children in Europe.

The interesting thing about them is that they not only challenge a lot of current government policy, they also uproot some of the most cherished landmarks on the educational landscape of the left as well as the right. Consider first this question: why have we accepted for so long that education is academic? Take two scenes.</p> <p>First, come to the Netherlands, to the small town of Hoorn, about 20 miles northeast of Amsterdam, to Tabor secondary school. On the first floor of a teaching block, a group of 14-year-olds are running a company. They are trading in sports equipment and DIY tools, ordering raw materials, organising production, sending out invoices and bills of sale. They deal with other companies in the Netherlands and further afield, as far as Russia and China, fielding phone calls, typing letters, sending emails and manning a reception desk for visitors. The teacher is the company president, the oldest pupil is the chief executive, the rest rotate their jobs: one week a sales manager, another week a secretary or a book-keeper. They carry business cards. At the end of the year, they produce their annual report, declaring their profit or loss.</p> <p>This is education, but it is also, in a sense, a game. The company they are running is a simulated one, as are the companies with which they trade, set up either by other schools or by commercial outfits who supply this as an educational service.</p> <p>There are two crucial points about this classroom. First, this is a form of secondary education that scarcely exists in this country - practical, vocational learning - but in the Netherlands (as in several other developed countries) it is part of the mainstream of school life, with 60% of pupils on some form of vocational pathway. And it is on an equal footing with academic learning. Second, it seems to work: by and large, the disaffected Dutch pupils are learning. They are scoring far better results than their British counterparts, particularly in mental arithmetic, science and foreign languages. Their attendance is better, their staying-on rates are higher. They are enjoying school.</p> <p>The key point here is not the obvious one. This is not about training pupils for vocational careers - although that may be a helpful side-effect. This is about motivating pupils who fail to engage with conventional academic schooling.</p> <p>The timetable is deliberately constructed so children move between practical classes, where they can use their hands, talk to friends, score some success; and academic classes, which may test their concentration. Dutch teachers say that as a result of lifting their students' motivation in the practical classes, they get much better results in the academic ones. The head of Tabor school, Henk Verreijen, says: \"The good thing in our system is that when they come to this school, they study at their own level so they also can get sufficient marks, which is good for their self-esteem. It gives them self-confidence and that is why a lot of children flourish here.\"</p> <p>Now come to Barking, on the eastern edge of London, to the college of further education on Dagenham Road, where a group of students in a workshop are working with bricks and mortar, laying the foundations of a house, the kind of vocational training that is normal in a college like this. But these are not the normal students. They are 14-year-old GCSE students, who are based down the road at Robert Clack comprehensive school, and they are part of a breakthrough, explicitly modelled on the Dutch vocational classes.</p> <p>There are two things you need to know about the local education authority in Barking and Dagenham. The first is that, although its Sats results now challenge national averages, its intake of children has the classic profile of a deprived community and, until 1990, this was reflected in the worst GCSE results in the whole country. Second, it has now become the second most improved LEA in the country by accepting the Department for Education and Employment's campaign for better teaching and management and then, crucially, by moving on to tackle the problems of its intake by adopting ground-breaking new ideas from the Netherlands and Switzerland - and leaving the DfEE scrambling to catch up behind it.</p> <p><b> Similarities</b><br></p> <p>Barking turned to Holland not just because of its relative success but also because of its structural similarities to Britain. The Dutch, too, have free parental choice and a market in school places, which is causing problems by polarising schools, so that some of the inner city \"black schools\" take more than 90% of their children from poor, often migrant families. They, too, have experimented with league tables and become so worried by their inaccuracy that they are now considering returning the business of quality control to their schools. Finally, and perhaps most important, their system is as underfunded as the British one. Despite the Dutch history of generous support for welfare services, their schools sit with the British in the lower reaches of the OECD tables for education funding in Europe.</p> <p>The Barking officials have been working with ideas from the Netherlands, all controversial, if not heretical. The first is the concept of vocational education.</p> <p>After a series of visits to Dutch schools, including Tabor, in the mid-1990s the LEA created six new courses for its GCSE students - in engineering, electronics, catering, construction, printing and industrial model-making. All used industry-standard equipment, demanded real skill and provided lessons of hands-on practical work. Demand is booming: 600 of the borough's 2,000 secondary students have signed up for the courses. At Robert Clack school, the special GCSE in construction has been so successful that they are setting up a similar course for sixth-formers. And this demand is coming from the disaffected and difficult students, who usually turn their backs on learning but who were hand-picked for first priority on the new GCSE courses. Barking's technology inspector, Nigel Sagar, said: \"You need to have a sense of all moving forward on pathways which may be different but which have parity of esteem and which produce qualifications of equal value.\"</p> <p>The key point is that, for the struggling pupil, these courses provoke interest instead of boredom. They offer a chance of success to those who are not academic and who are forced by our current curriculum to fail every day of the week, guaranteed to generate disaffection. The Barking officials think they are on to something of fundamental importance.</p> <p>However, amid the excitement, there has been a real frustration, for British schools have suffered one fundamental difference from their Dutch counterparts. There, vocational education is established nationally with the full support of its government; in Britain, it has been squeezed through a sieve of restrictive national rules and unchallenged assumptions.</p> <p>The DfEE argues that it is encouraging vocational courses. David Blunkett, the education secretary, now allows schools to \"disapply\" the national curriculum for some students, so they can drop up to two GCSE subjects and take up work-related training instead; last week, he announced new vocational GCSEs from September 2002. However, these moves disguise a history of procrastination in Whitehall. The gulf between the Netherlands and Barking remains huge.</p> <p>Dutch children in vocational streams spend up to 18 of their 32 weekly lessons in vocational classes - running catering outfits that serve meals in real restaurants, building mock houses, wiring and plumbing bathrooms, running shops with goods and tills, printing posters, designing and manufacturing clothes, repairing cars, learning transport logistics by shuttling simulated goods around the country. In Barking, schools have been able to smuggle no more than five practical lessons a week into the timetable. In the Netherlands, the schools have industry-specification workshops for every vocation. In Barking, they have to borrow space from Ford at Dagenham or the local college of further education. In the Netherlands, practical education is generously funded through mainstream budgets. In Barking, the DfEE has provided only \u00a318,000 a year under its \"demonstration project\" fund for experimental work, and the LEA is now being forced to turn to the European social fund to find \u00a3180,000 to set up adequate workshops in some of its schools.</p> <p>The first fence in this bureaucratic obstacle course has been the national curriculum. Paul Grant, the headteacher at Robert Clack, unilaterally dismantled his timetable, without consulting the DfEE, to make room for a \"more accessible curriculum\". Ofsted grumbled about this, but he has stuck to his guns and wants to do more to beat boredom.</p> <p>\"Although it has been relaxed, the national curriculum is still constricting,\" he says. \"Nobody has hauled me over the coals for it, but we are certainly running against the spirit of the national curriculum if not the letter. If I was given carte blanche, the children in the lower bands would be working with a very, very different curriculum.\"</p> <p>Then there are the league tables, which encourage schools to focus on middle-range children who may be able to score more A to Cs rather than on the least able. Mr Blunkett's new programme to provide special help for \"the gifted and talented\" exacerbates that trend. LEAs and teachers say it is a move backwards to offer a fast stream to the brightest children if the mainstream is left clogged.</p> <p>Last week's announcement by Mr Blunkett that he would introduce vocational GCSEs in 2002 is the first sign of a breakthrough in a long struggle. The education department's own advisers looked at vocational study and said: \"The pupils attack their work with a seriousness and satisfaction not always found in schools for pupils of their age. They concentrate because they are interested. They have the air of knowing what they are doing and exactly why it is worth doing.\" That report was written in 1930. For 70 years, while the Netherlands, Germany and Austria were embedding vocational classes in the core of their state schools, Whitehall has turned up its nose at the very idea.</p> <p>In the 1990s, the government agreed to introduce some vocational courses in secondary schools but insisted that these could not lead to GCSE qualifications. Instead, they made them GNVQs. Teachers say that stands for Getting Nowhere Very Quickly. LEA officials complain that employers do not understand the GNVQ, that it suffers from the lack of any national syllabus, and most of all that it is a second-class qualification, the very opposite of what they want - \"effectively pushing the low achievers into the hut at the back of the school\", as one official put it. Earlier this year, there were reports that the DfEE was thinking of shunting any remaining GCSE with a vocational element into the GNVQ siding - GCSEs in horticulture, agriculture and nautical studies were all at risk.</p> <p>Last week's announcement suggests that the DfEE is finally admitting the error of its ways. It was particularly significant that Mr Blunkett spoke of the new courses not just as a source of skill for industry but as a means of motivating disaffected children. However, officials are waiting to see whether this marks a real change of direction. There has been no commitment to providing workshops, without which the courses will be weak shadows of the Dutch ones. Nor has there been any commitment to sweep away the restrictions of the national curriculum to allow headteachers to provide vocational classes on the Dutch scale. Nigel Sagar, an LEA insepector, says: \"Unless there is a fundamental shift to accepting this principle of different pathways for different children, the comprehensive system will not achieve Mr Blunkett's objectives. They are trying to drive a broken car.\"</p> <p>As the Barking officials dug deeper into the Dutch system, they found more untested assumptions and started to entertain the possibility of increasingly radical solutions. In a sense, all of them revolve around one wicked little paradox. With the small but powerful exception of those who run Ofsted and the Department for Education, everyone involved in Britain's schools has recognised that children are different - their social class, their gender, the position of their birth month in the school year all have a recurring impact on their ability to achieve. For the left in this country, for anyone who cared at all about social justice, the gospel for dealing with this has been to provide equality of educational opportunity. The goal has been to offer all children of all classes the same curriculum in the same schools and to invite children to take the same exams at the same time.</p> <p>But what happens if you offer a level playing field to children of different abilities? The strong move ahead and the weak fall behind. Equality of opportunity preserves and promotes the inequalities that afflict the children at the outset.</p> <p>The alternative is to set up a system based on needs, in which all of these elements are varied to assist different kinds of children. Wim Meijnen, professor of education at Amsterdam University and a member of the national council that advises the Dutch government on schooling, says: \"The Dutch philosophy is to overcome these problems, in particular of poverty. Pupils who need the most can get the most assistance.\" The use of vocational courses is their way of moulding a different curriculum for different children. But there is more.</p> <p><b> This article is in two parts.

They carry business cards. At the end of the year, they produce their annual report, declaring their profit or loss. This is education, but it is also, in a sense, a game. The company they are running is a simulated one, as are the companies with which they trade, set up either by other schools or by commercial outfits who supply this as an educational service. There are two crucial points about this classroom. First, this is a form of secondary education that scarcely exists in this country - practical, vocational learning - but in the Netherlands (as in several other developed countries) it is part of the mainstream of school life, with 60% of pupils on some form of vocational pathway. And it is on an equal footing with academic learning. Second, it seems to work: by and large, the disaffected Dutch pupils are learning. They are scoring far better results than their British counterparts, particularly in mental arithmetic, science and foreign languages. Their attendance is better, their staying-on rates are higher. They are enjoying school. The key point here is not the obvious one. This is not about training pupils for vocational careers - although that may be a helpful side-effect. This is about motivating pupils who fail to engage with conventional academic schooling. The timetable is deliberately constructed so children move between practical classes, where they can use their hands, talk to friends, score some success; and academic classes, which may test their concentration. Dutch teachers say that as a result of lifting their students' motivation in the practical classes, they get much better results in the academic ones. The head of Tabor school, Henk Verreijen, says: \"The good thing in our system is that when they come to this school, they study at their own level so they also can get sufficient marks, which is good for their self-esteem. It gives them self-confidence and that is why a lot of children flourish here.\" Now come to Barking, on the eastern edge of London, to the college of further education on Dagenham Road, where a group of students in a workshop are working with bricks and mortar, laying the foundations of a house, the kind of vocational training that is normal in a college like this. But these are not the normal students. They are 14-year-old GCSE students, who are based down the road at Robert Clack comprehensive school, and they are part of a breakthrough, explicitly modelled on the Dutch vocational classes. There are two things you need to know about the local education authority in Barking and Dagenham. The first is that, although its Sats results now challenge national averages, its intake of children has the classic profile of a deprived community and, until 1990, this was reflected in the worst GCSE results in the whole country. Second, it has now become the second most improved LEA in the country by accepting the Department for Education and Employment's campaign for better teaching and management and then, crucially, by moving on to tackle the problems of its intake by adopting ground-breaking new ideas from the Netherlands and Switzerland - and leaving the DfEE scrambling to catch up behind it. Similarities Barking turned to Holland not just because of its relative success but also because of its structural similarities to Britain. The Dutch, too, have free parental choice and a market in school places, which is causing problems by polarising schools, so that some of the inner city \"black schools\" take more than 90% of their children from poor, often migrant families. They, too, have experimented with league tables and become so worried by their inaccuracy that they are now considering returning the business of quality control to their schools. Finally, and perhaps most important, their system is as underfunded as the British one. Despite the Dutch history of generous support for welfare services, their schools sit with the British in the lower reaches of the OECD tables for education funding in Europe. The Barking officials have been working with ideas from the Netherlands, all controversial, if not heretical. The first is the concept of vocational education. After a series of visits to Dutch schools, including Tabor, in the mid-1990s the LEA created six new courses for its GCSE students - in engineering, electronics, catering, construction, printing and industrial model-making. All used industry-standard equipment, demanded real skill and provided lessons of hands-on practical work. Demand is booming: 600 of the borough's 2,000 secondary students have signed up for the courses. At Robert Clack school, the special GCSE in construction has been so successful that they are setting up a similar course for sixth-formers. And this demand is coming from the disaffected and difficult students, who usually turn their backs on learning but who were hand-picked for first priority on the new GCSE courses. Barking's technology inspector, Nigel Sagar, said: \"You need to have a sense of all moving forward on pathways which may be different but which have parity of esteem and which produce qualifications of equal value.\" The key point is that, for the struggling pupil, these courses provoke interest instead of boredom. They offer a chance of success to those who are not academic and who are forced by our current curriculum to fail every day of the week, guaranteed to generate disaffection. The Barking officials think they are on to something of fundamental importance. However, amid the excitement, there has been a real frustration, for British schools have suffered one fundamental difference from their Dutch counterparts. There, vocational education is established nationally with the full support of its government; in Britain, it has been squeezed through a sieve of restrictive national rules and unchallenged assumptions. The DfEE argues that it is encouraging vocational courses. David Blunkett, the education secretary, now allows schools to \"disapply\" the national curriculum for some students, so they can drop up to two GCSE subjects and take up work-related training instead; last week, he announced new vocational GCSEs from September 2002. However, these moves disguise a history of procrastination in Whitehall. The gulf between the Netherlands and Barking remains huge. Dutch children in vocational streams spend up to 18 of their 32 weekly lessons in vocational classes - running catering outfits that serve meals in real restaurants, building mock houses, wiring and plumbing bathrooms, running shops with goods and tills, printing posters, designing and manufacturing clothes, repairing cars, learning transport logistics by shuttling simulated goods around the country. In Barking, schools have been able to smuggle no more than five practical lessons a week into the timetable. In the Netherlands, the schools have industry-specification workshops for every vocation. In Barking, they have to borrow space from Ford at Dagenham or the local college of further education. In the Netherlands, practical education is generously funded through mainstream budgets. In Barking, the DfEE has provided only \u00a318,000 a year under its \"demonstration project\" fund for experimental work, and the LEA is now being forced to turn to the European social fund to find \u00a3180,000 to set up adequate workshops in some of its schools. The first fence in this bureaucratic obstacle course has been the national curriculum. Paul Grant, the headteacher at Robert Clack, unilaterally dismantled his timetable, without consulting the DfEE, to make room for a \"more accessible curriculum\". Ofsted grumbled about this, but he has stuck to his guns and wants to do more to beat boredom. \"Although it has been relaxed, the national curriculum is still constricting,\" he says. \"Nobody has hauled me over the coals for it, but we are certainly running against the spirit of the national curriculum if not the letter. If I was given carte blanche, the children in the lower bands would be working with a very, very different curriculum.\" Then there are the league tables, which encourage schools to focus on middle-range children who may be able to score more A to Cs rather than on the least able. Mr Blunkett's new programme to provide special help for \"the gifted and talented\" exacerbates that trend. LEAs and teachers say it is a move backwards to offer a fast stream to the brightest children if the mainstream is left clogged. Last week's announcement by Mr Blunkett that he would introduce vocational GCSEs in 2002 is the first sign of a breakthrough in a long struggle. The education department's own advisers looked at vocational study and said: \"The pupils attack their work with a seriousness and satisfaction not always found in schools for pupils of their age. They concentrate because they are interested. They have the air of knowing what they are doing and exactly why it is worth doing.\" That report was written in 1930. For 70 years, while the Netherlands, Germany and Austria were embedding vocational classes in the core of their state schools, Whitehall has turned up its nose at the very idea. In the 1990s, the government agreed to introduce some vocational courses in secondary schools but insisted that these could not lead to GCSE qualifications. Instead, they made them GNVQs. Teachers say that stands for Getting Nowhere Very Quickly. LEA officials complain that employers do not understand the GNVQ, that it suffers from the lack of any national syllabus, and most of all that it is a second-class qualification, the very opposite of what they want - \"effectively pushing the low achievers into the hut at the back of the school\", as one official put it. Earlier this year, there were reports that the DfEE was thinking of shunting any remaining GCSE with a vocational element into the GNVQ siding - GCSEs in horticulture, agriculture and nautical studies were all at risk. Last week's announcement suggests that the DfEE is finally admitting the error of its ways. It was particularly significant that Mr Blunkett spoke of the new courses not just as a source of skill for industry but as a means of motivating disaffected children. However, officials are waiting to see whether this marks a real change of direction. There has been no commitment to providing workshops, without which the courses will be weak shadows of the Dutch ones. Nor has there been any commitment to sweep away the restrictions of the national curriculum to allow headteachers to provide vocational classes on the Dutch scale. Nigel Sagar, an LEA insepector, says: \"Unless there is a fundamental shift to accepting this principle of different pathways for different children, the comprehensive system will not achieve Mr Blunkett's objectives. They are trying to drive a broken car.\" As the Barking officials dug deeper into the Dutch system, they found more untested assumptions and started to entertain the possibility of increasingly radical solutions. In a sense, all of them revolve around one wicked little paradox. With the small but powerful exception of those who run Ofsted and the Department for Education, everyone involved in Britain's schools has recognised that children are different - their social class, their gender, the position of their birth month in the school year all have a recurring impact on their ability to achieve. For the left in this country, for anyone who cared at all about social justice, the gospel for dealing with this has been to provide equality of educational opportunity. The goal has been to offer all children of all classes the same curriculum in the same schools and to invite children to take the same exams at the same time. But what happens if you offer a level playing field to children of different abilities? The strong move ahead and the weak fall behind. Equality of opportunity preserves and promotes the inequalities that afflict the children at the outset. The alternative is to set up a system based on needs, in which all of these elements are varied to assist different kinds of children. Wim Meijnen, professor of education at Amsterdam University and a member of the national council that advises the Dutch government on schooling, says: \"The Dutch philosophy is to overcome these problems, in particular of poverty. Pupils who need the most can get the most assistance.\" The use of vocational courses is their way of moulding a different curriculum for different children. But there is more.

      "body": "<p><strong>Chapter One: Discovery</strong> </p> <p>Out of season, the bar of the Cobweb Inn at Boscastle is everything a pub should be. There is a low, heavily-beamed ceiling hung with antique bottles, and a plain floor which is a jigsaw of flagstones. Photographs of the local women's darts team hang on the wall, alongside framed, faded newspaper cuttings which record in print the several virtues of the inn. A log fire gives out rather more heat than is needed. There is no music save the low buzz of rich vernacular; in November, no Londoner ventures to the North Cornwall coast. The Cobweb is a slightly scruffy, comfortable old place, where you can talk if you need to, but if you feel like saying nothing you can just watch the flames in the hearth, and nobody will think you odd if a smile plays on your lips. It takes an effort of will to leave the dark, comfortable, nourishing womb of the inn, and emerge, blinking, into the bright world outside; but leave I must, because I have to find Beeny Cliff before the light fades. It can be dangerous out on the cliffs after nightfall. </p> <p> Boscastle is tucked into a cleft on the wild northern coast of the long peninsula that completes south-west England, and it is built around a narrow harbour where the River Valency cuts down to the sea. It is an ancient place, where the cosmetics of the tourist trade - Witchcraft Museum and knick-knack shops - have not quite succeeded in smothering a character that was born of slate and hardship. At one time the town comprised almost nothing but inns serving miners and seamen, of which the Cobweb is a survivor, and you can still imagine a dozen different signs advertising their wares all along the crooked street that leads to the haven. The houses are former inns, prettified with features that fail to disguise their boozy origins. The rough local stone gives the buildings their character. Even the Witchcraft Museum is a cottage with an ancient roof that sags crazily under the weight of Cornish slates. On this day the harbour is almost deserted, and I can imagine the place as it must have looked when the poet and novelist Thomas Hardy visited it as a young man, more than a century ago. </p> <p> I leave the town on the northern side of the harbour where the path zig-zags up the side of the steep valley. There are gorse bushes which even at this time of year cheerfully wave sprigs of yellow pea flowers. Small birds secretively flit across the path - a wren and some stonechats - as if inviting me onwards. From up here I can see piers guarding the long, narrow harbour entrance, barriers that were already ancient when the first Elizabeth was on the throne A cold breeze makes me wish I had put on an extra sweater, but I have luckily caught an interval between showers. Suddenly, I climb high enough to see the sea. This is one of those days when the furthest horizon is obscured in mist, as if the sea went on for ever. It is not stormy weather, but I can hear the growl of the surf smashing against cliffs, which weave in and out to the south, one after another, sheer to the sea. A white surf-line marks the junction: </p> <p> With its long sea lashings<br> And cliff side clashings</p> <p> as Hardy described this coast. The cliffs are dark, almost black, while the sea is strangely heavy, wrinkled like a pachyderm, so that only the lazily shifting white line of breakers serves to animate the prospect. The town in its secret valley has quite slipped from view; the solitude is absolute. I shelter from the breeze behind a wall, which is overgrown with rounded tussocks of sea campion and thrift. It is constructed mostly from blocks of slate; curiously, the slate slabs are placed vertically, so that they look like books set on their edges, pages towards you. I am accustomed to different, horizontally-built stone walls around Oxford. The pattern is broken by occasional piers incorporating angular blocks of white, coarse-looking vein quartz. The artisans who built these walls knew their rocks. Slates stacked vertical will let the rainwater (and there is plenty in Cornwall) drain rapidly away, parallel to the way the rock naturally splits. Rubbly quartz is indifferent to all weathers and makes for obstinate pillars. Both rock types are now decorated with a leafy, frilly form of green lichen, which softens every stony outline in such a damp climate. </p> <p> Now that I study the cliffs I can see that they, too, are made of the same black slates. This is why they seem so forbidding, so stern and dark. In places they are beetling (a word which only seems to apply to brows and cliffs) with teetering overhangs, fissured, and with obviously dangerous crags. These cliffs are a hymn to vertigo: 'haggard cliffs, of every ugly altitude...' I pay careful attention to the narrow and slippery path; there has been a lot of rain recently, and one foolish step might have serious consequences. Tumbledown stone walls indicate that fields formerly extended very close to the top of the sheer edge, but now there is only a steep grassy slope between the walker and the airy heights where razorbills and fulmars wheel on the wind. The few, stunted trees on the slopes lean away from the fall as if their branches stretched in horror from the tumbling edge. </p> <p> By the time I reach the top of Pentargon Bay I have some feeling for the geology. The dark rocks displayed on the inaccessible cliffs have surely suffered in a great vice of Earth movements, for they are tilted and crimped. No strata follow a straight line, instead they take off on a convoluted journey of their own. On the far side of the bay I can see a fissure that extends vertically from cliff edge to sea, which has been excavated by the elements over millennia. This is certainly a fault - a great fracture through the black rocks - a dislocation which must have once made the Earth shudder and tremble. Faults are the visible signatures of earthquakes, sealed for eternity in the rocks. The whole coast must have been gripped by a mighty upheaval causing the strata to crack and buckle. The evidence of a prehistoric paroxysm of the crust is imprinted on these heights. </p> <p> Look harder, and evidence of tectonism is everywhere. Not far from the fault a stream follows a narrow valley which has been excavated along another plane of weakness in the rocks. Where the stream reaches the sea its valley is cut off abruptly at the cliff, and the brook suddenly plunges into a waterfall two hundred feet above the sea, where it is whipped up by the breeze into spray. Near the water-line there are caves and smaller crevices which have been excavated by the probing sea. Even on such a calm day I can hear the suck and cough of waves assaulting the slates, picking out the weakest spots where folds have cracked the strata, marking each small fault with a chasm or a hole. From time to time a wave rushes into a cave compressing the air within it - which then recoils with a report. It makes a sound like distant cannon fire, an irregular salvo fired in an orogenic war. Imagine the battery on a stormy day. Now it is possible to comprehend how thousands of years of erosion have eventually isolated stacks and islands, like Meachard off Boscastle harbour. In time, these outposts of land will be worn quite away and returned to the sea. I can identify white quartz in the matrix of the gloomy cliffs, as clearly as scribblings of chalk on a blackboard. There is even a patch where the quartz trace shows the strata to have been folded over completely - turned upside down. I can only speculate on the massive forces which have treated solid rock with such disdain. Thicker masses of quartz are aligned along the faults. Squeezed from the rock like serum from a wound, it congeals in the cracks. This must have been the source of those large lumps in the stone walls. Elsewhere, it fills in voids in stressed rock like some kind of mad spaghetti. Ultimately, though, quartz is tougher than slate, and survives as pebbles long after the country rock has been eroded away. I would be willing to wager that some of the rounded pebbles on inaccessible Pentargon beach far below me are made of quartz. They will outlast these cliffs, and - who knows? - maybe they will outlast the human species. </p> <p> The sooty shales and slates were once soft muds - sediments - which accumulated deep beneath the sea. Time has transformed them: hardened them, elevated them hundreds of feet above present sea level, and folded them. But how much time? </p> <p> Where I am standing now, close to the edge, there is a notice in red letters: Caution! Cliffs are liable to cracking. Take extra care. And it's true. A stack of shale is teetering outwards into the void. It is hard to escape a shiver of apprehension as you imagine the block tumbling over and over to smash to pieces far below. The next haven up the coast is called Crackington, the name encapsulating the precariousness induced by erosion. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters/story/0,6761,342557,00.html\">More</a></p>",

When the House voted her into the chair, she insisted on sitting without the traditional full-bottomed wig and asked how she would like to be addressed as speaker, she replied instantly: \"Call me madam.\" Ms Boothroyd, now 70, presided over a host of reforms to rid the Commons of some its more arcane practices. In her Palace of Westminster quarters she regularly held receptions to show visitors how parliament worked.

She worked as a professional dancer from 1946 to 1948 and appeared in pantomime in London's West End as a member of the Tiller Girls' chorus line. But politics soon succeeded showbusiness in her life and in 1950 she contested a seat on Dewsbury council and was elected to Hammersmith borough council in 1965.

The National Institute of Economic and Social Research reports that 44,000 in two years were found work purely through New Deal intervention. It is a very good programme, it pays for itself in saved benefits. It takes in 40% functionally illiterate and gives many, if not yet all, skills to keep them in work.

Advertising for bids, sifting through, auditing, agreeing, employing and training staff takes a disappointingly long time. From idea to roll-out takes at least a couple of years - and politicians are impatient, as we have seen recently with Campbell and Blair throwing policy into speeches like pepper and salt: forget evidence-based policy when news priorities rule.

Michael Portillo, the man anointed as her political heir, and William Hague, the man she endorsed to lead her party in Portillo's absence, have performed a significant u-turn - unceremoniously jettisoning the Tory tax guarantee which was aimed at placing \"clear blue water\" between Labour and the Tories.</p> <p>Tories at Westminster, who are far removed from their former heroine these days, generally welcomed yesterday's joint announcement by Mr Hague and Mr Portillo.</p> <p>MPs on both wings of the party agreed that the policy - to cut taxes regardless of the state of the economy - had become a dangerous liability which left them open to Labour charges that they would cut spending on health and education.</p> <p>But the reversal of such a central plank of Mr Hague's commonsense revolution raises serious questions about his leadership and renews speculation about the threat posed by Mr Portillo. The shadow chancellor raised doubts about the policy within weeks of his appointment to the shadow cabinet and has campaigned relentlessly for it to be scrapped.</p> <p>The Hague camp made no secret yesterday of Mr Portillo's pivotal role in ditching the policy. \"Since Michael's appointment the spotlight has turned on the tax guarantee,\" said one senior Hague supporter.</p> <p>The Hague strategy yesterday was to come clean over the u-turn, admit the role played by Mr Portillo, but insist that there are no divisions. The Hague supporter said: \"There is political pain in what we have done, but that is worth the gain. We are still a tax-cutting party, but this will only be believed if the policy is credible. That was not possible with the tax guarantee.\"</p> <p>Mr Portillo and Mr Hague are said to have spent months working out how to abandon the guarantee, which was announced amid great fanfare at last year's Tory party conference. The two agreed that they would have to move before the chancellor Gordon Brown's comprehensive spending review next Tuesday and that they would have to quash speculation about a rift by acting together.</p> <p>The Daily Telegraph was unsurprisingly the chosen vehicle. Mr Hague revealed the u-turn in an interview with the paper, a message reinforced by Mr Portillo in an article on the comment page.</p> <p>Tory spinners, who were keen to avoid banner headlines about a u-turn, offered another tasty morsel to the paper to lessen the damage. Mr Hague also announced that he would restore the married couple's tax allowance, a subject dear to the Telegraph's heart. The paper, which led on the tax allowance rather than the u-turn, insisted that there was no deal with the Tories to play down the policy reversal.</p> <p>The volte face appeared to have paid off yesterday - at least in the short term - as dissidents such as Kenneth Clarke voiced support. The only criticism was directed at the former shadow chancellor, Francis Maude, who drew up the tax guarantee.</p> <p>But the move will weaken the position of Mr Hague, thereby bolstering Mr Portillo. \"The u-turn shows how Michael is slowly shaping policies that will make us more electable,\" said one senior Tory who is not known as a Portillo fan. \"But Michael is being careful to keep a low profile because he knows it would be fatal to overshadow William.\"</p> <p>The announcement yesterday led to an old-fashioned spat as Labour said that the Tories' new policy would lead to a massive drop in public spending. Andrew Smith, the chief secretary to the Treasury, claimed that the Tories would spend \u00a316bn less than Labour in the final year of the next spending round in 2003-04 because of their pledge to keep growth in public spending beneath the growth of the economy overall.</p> <p>The row was an early foretaste of next week's spending review in which Mr Brown will lay out the parameters for spending until deep into the next parliament. Labour believes big increases in spending will convince voters that the government is making a difference to public services and that the sacrifices made during the first two years of austerity were worth it.</p> <p>Rehearsing the arguments that will feature in the next general election campaign, Mr Smith yesterday challenged Mr Hague and his team to say where they would cut spending to make the \u00a316bn shortfall.</p> <p>Five key areas, social security (\u00a3103bn), health (\u00a354bn), education (\u00a346bn), defence (\u00a323bn), and law and order (\u00a320bn), make up almost 70% of total government spending. Mr Hague has pledged to match Labour's commitments on hospitals and schools and he has made a big issue out of law and order. On paper, social security looks the easiest target, but half the welfare budget goes on pensions.</p> <p>The Hague-Portillo u-turn will come as little surprise to veterans of the last government who remember the difficulties the Tories experienced in squaring the circle between raising spending and cutting taxes. The tax burden rose sharply in the early 1980s, fell during the Lawson boom, before rising again in the mid-1990s as the bills came in for the borrowing binge during the recession of 1990-92.</p> <p>Labour now has the money in the bank to increase spending by 3.3% over the next three years without increasing taxes. Under current plans, the government will still be running a surplus on current spending by 2003-04.</p> <p>The Tories know that they will never win an election in the face of such statistics. Mr Hague has therefore set his sights on denting Labour's big majority, a task he can only achieve if he abandons policies such as the tax guarantee which left the Tories open to charges that health and education would not be safe in his hands.</p> <p><b>Jettisoned pledges</b><br> <b> Minimum wage</b> <br>Two days after his appointment as shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo dropped opposition to minimum wage.</p> <p><b> Bank independence</b> <br>Portillo also abandoned Tory opposition to independence of the Bank of England</p> <p><b> Patient's charter</b> <br>Hague watered down patient's guarantee when he admitted a Tory government would be unable to provide every NHS patient with a guaranteed waiting time.</p> <p><b> Full employment</b> <br>Portillo in language of post-war Keynesians said Tories would set \"full employment\" as a goal.</p> <p><b> Tax guarantee</b> <br> Hague ditched the central plank of his Commonsense Revolution yesterday when he admitted the Tories could not guarantee to cut taxes.</p>",

That was not possible with the tax guarantee.\" Mr Portillo and Mr Hague are said to have spent months working out how to abandon the guarantee, which was announced amid great fanfare at last year's Tory party conference. The two agreed that they would have to move before the chancellor Gordon Brown's comprehensive spending review next Tuesday and that they would have to quash speculation about a rift by acting together. The Daily Telegraph was unsurprisingly the chosen vehicle. Mr Hague revealed the u-turn in an interview with the paper, a message reinforced by Mr Portillo in an article on the comment page. Tory spinners, who were keen to avoid banner headlines about a u-turn, offered another tasty morsel to the paper to lessen the damage. Mr Hague also announced that he would restore the married couple's tax allowance, a subject dear to the Telegraph's heart. The paper, which led on the tax allowance rather than the u-turn, insisted that there was no deal with the Tories to play down the policy reversal. The volte face appeared to have paid off yesterday - at least in the short term - as dissidents such as Kenneth Clarke voiced support. The only criticism was directed at the former shadow chancellor, Francis Maude, who drew up the tax guarantee. But the move will weaken the position of Mr Hague, thereby bolstering Mr Portillo. \"The u-turn shows how Michael is slowly shaping policies that will make us more electable,\" said one senior Tory who is not known as a Portillo fan. \"But Michael is being careful to keep a low profile because he knows it would be fatal to overshadow William.\" The announcement yesterday led to an old-fashioned spat as Labour said that the Tories' new policy would lead to a massive drop in public spending. Andrew Smith, the chief secretary to the Treasury, claimed that the Tories would spend \u00a316bn less than Labour in the final year of the next spending round in 2003-04 because of their pledge to keep growth in public spending beneath the growth of the economy overall. The row was an early foretaste of next week's spending review in which Mr Brown will lay out the parameters for spending until deep into the next parliament. Labour believes big increases in spending will convince voters that the government is making a difference to public services and that the sacrifices made during the first two years of austerity were worth it. Rehearsing the arguments that will feature in the next general election campaign, Mr Smith yesterday challenged Mr Hague and his team to say where they would cut spending to make the \u00a316bn shortfall. Five key areas, social security (\u00a3103bn), health (\u00a354bn), education (\u00a346bn), defence (\u00a323bn), and law and order (\u00a320bn), make up almost 70% of total government spending. Mr Hague has pledged to match Labour's commitments on hospitals and schools and he has made a big issue out of law and order. On paper, social security looks the easiest target, but half the welfare budget goes on pensions. The Hague-Portillo u-turn will come as little surprise to veterans of the last government who remember the difficulties the Tories experienced in squaring the circle between raising spending and cutting taxes. The tax burden rose sharply in the early 1980s, fell during the Lawson boom, before rising again in the mid-1990s as the bills came in for the borrowing binge during the recession of 1990-92. Labour now has the money in the bank to increase spending by 3.3% over the next three years without increasing taxes. Under current plans, the government will still be running a surplus on current spending by 2003-04. The Tories know that they will never win an election in the face of such statistics. Mr Hague has therefore set his sights on denting Labour's big majority, a task he can only achieve if he abandons policies such as the tax guarantee which left the Tories open to charges that health and education would not be safe in his hands. Jettisoned pledges Minimum wage Two days after his appointment as shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo dropped opposition to minimum wage. Bank independence Portillo also abandoned Tory opposition to independence of the Bank of England Patient's charter Hague watered down patient's guarantee when he admitted a Tory government would be unable to provide every NHS patient with a guaranteed waiting time. Full employment Portillo in language of post-war Keynesians said Tories would set \"full employment\" as a goal. Tax guarantee Hague ditched the central plank of his Commonsense Revolution yesterday when he admitted the Tories could not guarantee to cut taxes.",

Five key areas, social security (\u00a3103 billion), health (\u00a354 billion), education (\u00a346 billion), defence (\u00a323 billion), and law and order (\u00a320 billion), make up almost 70% of total government spending. Mr Hague has pledged to match Labour's commitments on hospitals and schools and he has made a big issue out of law and order. On paper, social security looks the easiest target, but half the welfare budget goes on pensions. Labour now has the money in the bank to increase spending by 3.3% over the next three years without increasing taxes. Under current plans, the government will still be running a surplus on current spending by 2003-04. The Tories know that they will never win an election in the face of such statistics. Mr Hague has therefore set his sights on denting Labour's big majority, a task he can only achieve if he abandons policies such as the tax guarantee which left the Tories open to charges that health and education would not be safe in his hands. Jettisoned pledges Minimum wage Two days after his appointment as shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo dropped opposition to minimum wage. Bank independence Portillo also abandoned Tory opposition to independence of the Bank of England Patient's charter Hague watered down patient's guarantee when he admitted a Tory government would be unable to provide every NHS patient with a guaranteed waiting time. Full employment Portillo in language of post-war Keynesians said Tories would set \"full employment\" as a goal. Tax guarantee Hague ditched the central plank of his commonsense revolution yesterday when he admitted the Tories could not guarantee to cut taxes.",

Bouncing back from his drubbing in the chamber the week before, Tony Blair told the Commons that the Conservative party's change of heart on taxation was a threat to public services and in some instances \"cruel\". The Labour leader's attack on Tory taxation policies dominated the half-hour session. \"Yesterday a very significant thing happened\", he said, claiming that the shadow chancellor had impaled the Tory leader on \"a \u00a317bn spending cuts guarantee\".

The Conservative leader was put under pressure over a range of promises. \"The one thing everyone knows,\" said Mr Blair, \"is if they vote Tory at the next election it means fewer nurses, fewer teachers, fewer police and fewer hospitals\". He took the opportunity to emphasise that Labour was the party which could best protect public services and insisted there were now clear \"dividing lines\" between the parties. Using all six of his permitted questions, William Hague attempted to taunt the prime minister over the foreign secretary's comment last week that British membership of a European single currency was \"inevitable\". \"Don't we have an utterly divided and shambolic government where you can't agree with the foreign secretary on a central issue of policy,\" he asked. \"He goes on about his five economic tests but the test that really matters is leadership and he has failed it\", Hague added, before turning to the rise in crime expected to be revealed by figures next week. The prime minister admitted that the government had not always met with success. \"It is true that in the last year there has been a three-to-four per cent rise in crime\", he said. \"The question is what do we do?\" He also agreed that \"for the last six years, police numbers have fallen\". But he said forthcoming investment would turn this around. All debate was overshadowed, however, by the announcement by House of Commons speaker Betty Boothroyd that she is to retire this summer.

Ms Boothroyd's move will spark a race for her prestigious post, with Liberal Democrat MP Menzies Campbell the frontrunner thought to be favoured by Tony Blair. Many Labour backbenchers are believed to prefer one of their own, Gwyneth Dunwoody, Labour MP for Crewe and Nantwich and veteran of 34 years in the Commons. MPs will be given a \"free\" vote to decide which MP becomes the new speaker when parliament reconvenes after the summer recess. Parliamentary tradition decrees that the chair alternates between the Tories and Labour, but MPs are expected to ignore that by electing a Labour or Liberal Democrat speaker. If Mr Campbell were elected, he would be the first Liberal speaker since 1924. The speaker's job comes with a \u00a395,000-plus salary similar to that of a cabinet minister but the holder's role as Commons referee guarantees a media profile higher than most ministers. Although a popular figure, well respected by senior MPs, Ms Boothroyd had been rumoured for some months to be planning her retirement, though most had expected she would stay in the post until after the next general election. Privately, some ministers have suggested she was too resistant to New Labour's programme of reforms. Commons leader Margaret Beckett led the tributes to Ms Boothroyd, telling her that MPs had taken \"much pride and pleasure\" from her tenure. Ms Beckett confirmed that, according to precedent, Ms Boothroyd would make a valedictory statement to the House before it went into recess on July 26.",

His grandparents pop in all the time and it does help: you feel a lot more supported. Having Joshua has changed me: I'm a lot more patient now.\" </p> <p><strong> Baby:</strong> Jordan McCabe. </p> <p> <strong> Family:</strong> Joanne McCabe and Ian Macmillan, both 29. The couple, who live in the centre of Glasgow, already have a two-year-old son, Cameron. Joanne is a finance assistant with a housing association and Ian works for a distillery. </p> <p> <strong> How it's going:</strong> \"In many ways, life has carried on much as before,\" says Joanne. \"Because of Cameron we had already completely adapted to having a small child around, so this time it's been nothing like the upheaval it was when he arrived. Luckily for us, he doesn't seem to be jealous at all - although I do try very hard to give him lots of time. </p> <p>\"Jordan sleeps a lot in the daytime, which makes it easier. The main thing I've noticed this time around is how much more confidence I've got about everything; it's obviously because I'm a second-time mum and you just worry a lot less. </p> <p>\"I remember with Cameron I could hardly sleep because I was so afraid something might happen to him, but once you've done it you realise it's not so scary.\" </p> <p><strong> Baby:</strong> Jack Picton. </p> <p> <strong> Family:</strong> Mother is Maxine Picton, 34, a TV cabinet packer. Maxine lives with her mum in Ovenden, a former council estate outside Halifax town centre. </p> <p> <strong> How it's going:</strong> \"Since Jack was born I only see his dad when I take the baby up there. We're not together any more; it was always a bit on-off anyway. But I don't feel isolated as a single mum; I've got lots of help on hand because I live with my mother. It makes it a lot easier really. </p> <p>\"I do hope that Jack and I get somewhere of our own to live in the long term. But for now things are fine. Jack isn't a difficult baby: he only wakes once during the night and my mum often looks after him in the daytime so I can catch up on my sleep. </p> <p>\"He's on bottles now. I did try breastfeeding but it didn't work out - he didn't seem to be able to do it - so I moved him onto bottles at two days. I do feel a bit different myself since having Jack. He comes first now, so I always have to think about him before anything else.\" </p> <p><strong> Baby:</strong> Emily Rose Hale. </p> <p><strong> Family:</strong> Sheila Hale, 35, a school cook, and husband Graeme. Like Cherie Blair, Sheila already has a 12-year-old daughter, Leanne, and a 14-year-old son, Christopher (pictured). But Emily is a first baby for Graeme, 28, a dairy worker. </p> <p><strong> How it's going:</strong> \"I can understand what happened to the Blair family last week with Euan,\" says Sheila. \"It's not easy to have time for everyone when you have a baby. The older children seem to get on with their lives, while the baby is very demanding. You have to make the effort to have time for the older ones: they still have needs, although they're not as obvious as the baby's. </p> <p>\"I'm lucky because Emily is a good sleeper; I use the time when she's napping to be with Leanne and Christo pher. They love Emily to bits; they're always picking her up and playing with her. It's great for me; when they come in from school I know that, if it's been a tough day, I'll get five minutes to myself because they'll look after Emily for me.\" </p> <p>For Graeme, Emily has brought the realisation that fathering a child himself is not like having stepchildren. \"It's definitely different having a child of our own. Emily is lovely - we all enjoy her a lot. She's really smiley and we have lots of fun with her. </p> <p>\"Sometimes, if I'm honest, I do worry about the future and the responsibility of what's now quite a big family, but I don't think it's worth letting that spoil our pleasure in the children now. I think it will be all right in the end.\" </p> <p><strong> Baby:</strong> Scott Lee Rosser. </p> <p> <strong> Family:</strong> Sarah Charles, 19, and Mark Rosser, 36, are both unemployed. Sarah recently finished a nursery nursing course. They live in a flat on a council estate. </p> <p> <strong> How it's going:</strong> Although this is Sarah's first baby, it's Mark's 10th. \"It is quite a lot,\" he agrees. \"It gets me down a bit sometimes. The eldest is 16, and there are three other mothers as well as Sarah. I see all my children regularly - I think it's really important - and they've all seen Scott and love him. </p> <p>\"Of course I've done all this baby bit many times before, but I don't mind it. In a way, Scott is special because he's definitely going to be the last. And I'm going to stay with Sarah, so he's the one I'll be bringing up myself full time.\" </p> <p>For Sarah, the main surprise about mothering has been how exhausting it is. \"I feel tired all the time,\" she says. \"He sleeps at night, but he's awake all day. I really thought babies slept a lot in the daytime. I feel as though I'm always changing him or feeding him and then if he does have a little sleep, I have to quickly start doing the washing and all the other jobs.\" </p> <p>Sarah's mother, who lives nearby, is a big help. \"She'll have him for me whenever I ask and, as he's bottle-fed, it means I can get out from time to time. My mum takes him into town with her every Saturday for a couple of hours, and I catch up on some sleep while he's gone.\" </p> <p><strong> Baby:</strong> Bethany Elliott. </p> <p> <strong> Family:</strong> Claire and Stuart Elliott, both police officers. Claire, 27, and Stuart, 33, live in a large three-bedroomed flat in Bexley, Kent. </p> <p> <strong> How it's going:</strong> \"I'm loving it,\" says Claire. \"I worked up to a week before Bethany was born, so I didn't have time to think a lot about how it would be once the baby arrived. </p> <p>\"The only problem I've had was with breastfeeding: Bethany just failed to gain any weight. It was so upsetting. The midwives kept coming round to weigh her, and she was losing weight - 10oz in the end. </p> <p>\"The midwives were really supportive. They came round every day for the first week or so, and then at least three times a week for the first month. In the end I had to put Bethany on to bottles to build up her weight, but I'm still breastfeeding as well and I like the sense of closeness that involves. </p> <p>\"Stuart and I have adapted to parenthood far more easily than I thought we would. In the early weeks we shared getting up for night feeds, but now Bethany is a brilliant sleeper; she goes down at about 9.30pm and sleeps until 5am or so. She's an independent little thing; we tried having her cot in our room with us but she just screamed, so we moved her to her own room and she seems to prefer it there. </p> <p>\"Our eight-week check is this week, and Bethany will have her first jab. We're happy to have immunisations: I had them all and I've been OK. </p> <p>\"Physically, I feel more or less back to normal. I go to a postnatal exercise class once a week and I've lost most of the weight I put on during the pregnancy.\" </p> <p><strong> Baby:</strong> Alexander FitzGerald. </p> <p><strong>Family:</strong> Lauren, 29, and Patrick, 34, FitzGerald are Australians who came to live in London last year. She's a commercial lawyer (on maternity leave) and he's an IT consultant. </p> <p><strong>How it's going:</strong> \"Really well. We've been very lucky in that we've had a lot of support, and I think that matters a lot,\" says Lauren. \"We hired an independent midwife for Alexander's birth and she was visiting us regularly until last week. </p> <p>\"She was a lifeline, especially as I had a lot of problems establishing breastfeeding. Alexander wasn't able to latch on properly and it was incredibly painful. In the end I had to express my milk, which was very time-consuming. It turned out that he needed a minor operation on his tongue. That's now been done and the difference is amazing - I'm enjoying feeding him and it's much easier, as well as being so convenient. </p> <p>\"I've been surprised by how little he sleeps during the day. I had plans to do a bit of work here and there, but I get no time. Some days I feel I accomplish nothing; I go to bed at night and all I've done is feed the baby. The lack of sleep is hard to live with; Patrick and I feel we've been coping quite well, but it is draining. We're used to between six and eight hours of unbroken sleep a night, and now the most we ever get at a stretch is five hours. </p> <p>\"I'm taking Alexander to the clinic next week and I'm going to ask some questions about immunisations, but we've not decided yet what to do. It's not something we'll do automatically; I want to make an informed decision and need to do some research before we decide. </p> <p>\"Having Alexander has definitely changed me. I hadn't realised - I don't know if you can - how overwhelming the love you have for your baby is, how tiny and needy they are. It's changed my priorities, how I see the world. </p> <p>\"And it's amazing how much goodwill a new baby generates: we've had emails from all over the world, from people we hadn't seen for 10 years!\"</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Casting my mind back to the end of my GCSEs, Euan's behaviour seems almost tame. That night we too went out to celebrate at one of London's most exclusive clubs, rubbing shoulders with famous footballers and pop stars. </p> <p>How did a group of 16-year-olds get in? With no problem at all. We strolled through the doors, welcomed by 6ft bouncers. This was no surprise to us. We have all been regulars at select London pubs since we were 14. The age of house parties is long gone and, since pubs shut at 11pm, we began to visit these so called \"exclusive\" hot spots, becoming friendly with various club promoters, owners and the regular club crowds - who were all a lot older and richer than us. </p> <p>Of course our return home in the early hours of the morning did not go unnoticed by our parents, who would question us on our whereabouts and our company. Just as over-anxious parents can come up with extremely unlikely scenarios (Louise's mother, for example, worries about drugs being slipped into her drink, but who wants to give drugs away?), so the more naive parents often underestimate their children's behaviour. One friend's mother imagines her daughter to be religious, hardworking and not interested in boys.

      "bodyText": "Casting my mind back to the end of my GCSEs, Euan's behaviour seems almost tame. That night we too went out to celebrate at one of London's most exclusive clubs, rubbing shoulders with famous footballers and pop stars. How did a group of 16-year-olds get in? With no problem at all. We strolled through the doors, welcomed by 6ft bouncers. This was no surprise to us. We have all been regulars at select London pubs since we were 14. The age of house parties is long gone and, since pubs shut at 11pm, we began to visit these so called \"exclusive\" hot spots, becoming friendly with various club promoters, owners and the regular club crowds - who were all a lot older and richer than us. Of course our return home in the early hours of the morning did not go unnoticed by our parents, who would question us on our whereabouts and our company. Just as over-anxious parents can come up with extremely unlikely scenarios (Louise's mother, for example, worries about drugs being slipped into her drink, but who wants to give drugs away?), so the more naive parents often underestimate their children's behaviour. One friend's mother imagines her daughter to be religious, hardworking and not interested in boys. The daughter in question first had sex at the age of 13 in a Portaloo. However, some parents have the misfortune to find these things out first hand. Take Emma, whose boyfriend's mother walked in on them having a shower, or Jessica and Mark, who were otherwise engaged when her mother walked in to tell Jessica that tea was ready. Sex, drugs and alcohol appear in most of our lives but usually not in the form most parents would think. My parents are worried about the availability of drugs such as Ecstasy when cocaine is a far more fashionable and accessible drug. In some West End clubs, tables require a minimum input of about \u00a3300, but \"fashionable\" drugs such as cocaine can be bought for \u00a350 a gram and are widely available in the middle-class houses of north London where they are seen as a step up from \"draw\" [cannabis]. Drugs are sold by many of our friends, who handle large quantities for an even larger profit. One such dealer, David - then 16 and now in early retirement - took his \"business\" so seriously that he invested in silver weighing scales, a designer bag for his drugs and two mobiles: one for his friends, one for his clients. Of course, image has a great deal to do with teenage life. However shallow it may seem, phones, the latest clothes and fast cars all show your wealth and social standing. One 22-year-old friend already owns a Lotus Elise, which he says represents his personality. For my friends it's age that matters. While boys are searching for a free house in which to smoke draw to their heart's content, the girls look to older men for fun and independence. Our friend Rachel has been seeing a 28-year-old for the past year and most of our weekends are spent at clubs with people between the ages of 18 and 24. Teenage activity varies according to age, sex and wealth but the aim is the same: to go out and have a good time. Of course our parents will worry. We know deep down that they are only looking out for us because they have been there themselves. But things haven't changed that much and they probably never will.

Holidays are about misery, despair, being scared witless, falling out with friends, falling out of love, separation, counselling, crisis. Holidays are about taking away the kids for a fetid fortnight of the soul. We're talking deep underbellies and psychic displacement. </p> <p>I admit I've always had my negative side, but holidays give me the existential wobbles. I look at a holiday brochure and, without wishing to come over all Proustian, I think of loss. </p> <p>The family holiday airlifts us out of reality and splat-drops us in on the unknown. And do we like the unknown? Do we rise to the challenge, strap on our adventure boots and stride purposely on to the great plains of experience? Do we buggery. We hate it. And so do the kids. </p> <p>In normal life, we just about cope by swaddling ourselves in everyday securities - Countdown, Jaffa Cakes, the gym, our bed. Some of us even manage to keep relationships going by allowing ourselves sufficient physical and emotional space. On holiday we do away with all that. We strip ourselves of our protective layers, expose ourselves to the elements and burn in a claustrophobic hell. </p> <p>I've associated holidays with horror ever since I was five and got lost on an Italian beach. More of a desert than a beach actually. Mile after mile of it. I had gone off for an ice cream, and couldn't find my way back. I walked forever in a straight line until I was soaked in exhaustion and sick with panic. The beach began to empty, and I was left, tiny and terrified and too proud to tell the few remaining stragglers that I was lost. After the panic came resignation, which was even worse because I'd given up. Eventually a policeman scooped me up off the sand, put me on the back of his bike and carried me off to my weeping mother. </p> <p>Then a few years ago at the seaside I took little Maya for a wee in a forbidding, heavily tattooed pub. Alix, who was five and all grown up, decided to wander when we were in the loo. No one in the pub looked me in the face when I asked whether they'd seen her. It was probably only a couple of minutes later that we found her wandering along the pier, but it felt like decades. </p> <p>You never get lost in your own street back home. This is something my children know too. They hate the unfamiliar. The other week we got a new car. Alix and Maya still say it's horrible, and ask why we can't go in the lovely old car, despite the fact that it doesn't work. They had never shown any affection for the car until it was taken away from them. Maya suggested a compromise - perhaps we could keep the car so she can look at it every day and wave hello. </p> <p>Don't they call it the shock of the new? Same with holidays. When we go away the kids suddenly see home in a new light. Yes, the beach and the pool and the sea are nice enough, but where's our lovely bedroom and our lovely kitchen and our lovely garden which is too small to play games in, and our lovely hose with which we can drench ourselves and pretend we're on holiday swimming in the pool? From the moment we set off they are mourning the loss of the home that they take for granted for the other 51 weeks of the year. </p> <p>Fair enough, kids are contrary sods. But even so they are right to be confused about hols. There is something truly bizarre about the notion that you give the children the treat of their lives by removing them from all they love: no TV, no games, no home, no friends ... Have a nice trip! </p> <p>Still, at least the kids make new friends, hey? Yes, for about half an hour. And then they're gone. Every year they manage to fall in love with some sweet little tot as they're packing away the swimming costume for the last time. Half an hour for a week's worth of mourning the loss of a soulmate: the pictures that weren't taken, the disco nights they could have shared, the Agadoo dance routines that oh so nearly were. </p> <p>Well, there's always the beach for light relief. Sure, it's a little uncomfy with the sand down the pants and the mozzies and the ice cream-stick splinters buried in the sand. But there is the glorious moment when the sandcastle is complete. The grin of pure pleasure, concentrated achievement. Until some vindictive little git kicks it over or the waves soak it into history. If a holiday teaches children anything, it's that nothing lasts forever, that the world is as cruel as it's transient. \"Won't you take me back home ...\", as Slade sang all those years ago. </p> <p>Still, the summer is here and Majorca beckons. A compromise: a holiday, but nothing new. Home from home. So safe and familiar that the kids forget they're on holiday and start to enjoy themselves. Hotel Tucan, Cala D'or, if you're interested. Nice place, familiar feel to it. Pool table by the swimming pool, table tennis by the pool table, Smarties at the bar, straw donkeys at the mini-store next door. </p> <p>Now let's get one thing straight. This is not an advert for the Hotel Tucan or for Cala D'or. There is nothing exceptional about either hotel or resort. The hotel looks like every other hotel on the block. The food is great on the first day, quite good the second, and gross for the rest of the week. The pool's wet. </p> <p>We went to the same hotel last year. The year before that we had a break from our normal break. But the kids were disorientated by Portugal - strange fish, alien sand, no disco. The year before that we had a week at the Hotel Tucan, Cala D'or. Interesting old life. </p> <p>Only one difference. We've always taken people away with us. My parents, my partner's parents, my mate Les, who's old enough to be my dad at a pinch. They know they're basically there to look after us, but they don't mind so much because they can pretend they're looking after the grandchildren. Anyway, this year we're going by ourselves, braving it. Which will be exciting and liberating. Except for the fact that we won't be able to go out at night unless we fancy lugging the kids around with us or going out by ourselves on a rota basis. Sitting alone in a Majorcan pub, not a friend in the land, can't be bad. Still, not to worry. Only two grand for the four of us, and it'll be over soon.</p>",

The half-hearted support of the clearers is dangerous, given the views of the Don Cruickshank report into competition in the sector, but little surprise given that between them they have 75% of the current account market. Abbey National and Halifax, the traditional mortgage banks, have upped the stakes in the current account market by making it clear they will bend over backwards to try to lure lucrative customers. This might explain the big four's attitude. Perhaps they are concerned that the age-old lethargy that makes customers more likely to divorce their spouses than change their current accounts is about end.",

If the NHS is finally gearing up to modernise cancer therapy, it is at least partly thanks to the productive channelling of one cancer survivor's angry response to her care. </p> <p>Ten years ago, Becky Miles - now 41 - was told she had Hodgkin's disease, with a tumour the size of a cantaloupe melon entangled in her chest cavity. In the previous two years, she had seen 13 different consultants who all missed the cancer despite \"textbook symptoms\". Once diagnosed as a case of \"a difficult red-haired woman\", she says most consultants were well-meaning. \"It was the system, not the individuals, that let me down.\" </p> <p>As a patient, Miles took nothing for granted. She had two children, the youngest still not one, and her sister had died of breast cancer at age 35. Told there was no choice about chemotherapy regimens, she bought a haematology textbook, a dictionary to translate it and fought for access to medical journals. As a result, she was \"continually aware of doctors making weird, idiosyncratic decisions about treatment, rarely based on research, delivered in a way that seemed designed to disempower me\". </p> <p>Over the intense weeks and months during, and recovering from, chemotherapy, she developed a vision of how cancer services should be provided. \"I didn't just want better mannered doctors, I wanted to change the system,\" she recalls. Her experience as director of Scientists against Nuclear Arms had taught her that the way to effect change quickly - \"I didn't know how long I had\" - was to influence key decision-makers. </p> <p>So she made her voice heard strategically. By 1993, she was appointed a member of the London implementation group, then reviewing cancer services in the capital, and later became the patient representative on the influential Calman/Hines working party on cancer care. </p> <p>With the support of doctors, including top specialist Karol Sikora, she set up the National Cancer Alliance (NCA), a small but highly influential alliance of cancer patients and health professionals. And she sat down after dinner with a group of cancer patients (only two of whom are still alive) and a few bottles of wine and wrote down, on a long piece of wallpaper, a list of the needs of people at different stages in cancer treatment. </p> <p>David Kerr, professor of clinical oncology at the Institute for Cancer Studies at Birmingham University, says meeting her dramatically changed his view of cancer care. \"For the first time, I became aware of how badly patients can be let down by doctors , how poor communication can have a devastating impact on outcome, how services are organised for the benefit of the professionals, not the public.\" </p> <p>Mike Richards, a fomer NCA trustee and now the government's \"cancer tsar\", says Becky was pivotal in developing the philosophy of care that informed both Calman/Hines and the forthcoming national cancer plan that he will launch this autumn. \"The word patient-centred was not really in the language 10 years ago. The fact that it now informs all our thinking is largely down to her,\" he says. \"She has put enormous pressure on health care professionals to work in multi-disciplinary teams, learning to exchange information with each other, as well as the person they're treating.\" </p> <p>Challenged by Miles to acknowledge that changing the system could achieve more mortality gain than new buildings or pouring money into new drugs, Kerr persuaded West Midlands regional health authority to hire her as the region's cancer co-ordinator. Together they embarked on a four-year appraisal programme, visiting the 24 acute trusts in the region, using peer review to measure the service provided against the standards set by Calman/Hine. \"We were known as the cancer police,\" recalls Kerr. </p> <p>Since then, Miles has continued to work part-time for West Midlands using the job of cancer co-ordinator to drive up standards in 13 health authorities, as well as continuing as part-time director of the NCA. Kerr believes that she may be spreading herself thinly - and that she might have done better concentrating on building up the alliance as a powerful, fundraising, patient advocacy organisation - something that is common in the US but almost non-existent so far in Britain. </p> <p>Miles disagrees. The impact of the \"lean, mean\" NCA has been substantial, she says, without advertising for members or rallying for funds. At its annual meeting on Saturday, the alliance is to launch its latest project, the\"teamwork file\" - a personal information file which will provide cancer patients with far better written information than any number of generalised patient information leaflets. And working with NHS professionals is the best way, she says, to avoid the trap of blaming professionals. \"What's wrong with the service is not just that patients are disempowered. So are doctors and other professionals who have been pressured to compete with each other and forced to keep quiet about inadequacies in the service. Even senior managers are often exhausted and bruised and treated badly.\" </p> <p>But with the NHS poised to implement much of her vision of a service fit to provide a responsive, holistic treatment across the country, she admits her future role is unclear. Though all regions have followed the West Midlands example and appointed cancer coordinators, other appointments were internal. \"The NHS has got to decide whether it wants people like me working within it, challenging orthodoxy, asking difficult questions, driving up standards. I am not clear at the moment whether that is the case.\" </p> <p>She has no doubt, however, that her job is not yet finished. \"I took a call the other day from the father of a boy who had just been diagnosed with a rare cancer of the palate and told the local hospital was going to operate. He'd found the number on the internet and he was still crying when I spoke to him. I was able to find out the nearest specialist centre for the particular cancer. The boy himself answered when I called to hand on the information - something he won't be able to do in a week's time. Realising the agonising year ahead facing that family convinced me once again how important it is that the NHS does get it right.\"</p>",

He'd found the number on the internet and he was still crying when I spoke to him. I was able to find out the nearest specialist centre for the particular cancer. The boy himself answered when I called to hand on the information - something he won't be able to do in a week's time. Realising the agonising year ahead facing that family convinced me once again how important it is that the NHS does get it right.\"",

Based on a review led by Sir Graham Hart, former permanent secretary at the Department of Health, the report says there is also a risk that it will not be possible to achieve the government's national service framework for mental health without more staff and rapid improvement in their skills and competencies. According to Andrew McCulloch, one of the report's authors: \"We are in potentially serious trouble\". </p> <p>The review was commissioned by the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health in order not only to get a clear perspective on staffing problems, but also to point the way forward. The report says services need to break out of a costly and destabilising cycle of short-term solutions, exemplified by a reliance on agency workers, and to set strategic goals of making mental health more attractive to recruits, creating stronger leadership for the sector and doing far more to support and sustain staff. </p> <p>Beyond this, though, the review group is calling for targeted solutions to specific problems - not all of them local in nature. The government, it says, should, among other things, reappraise NHS pension rules to determine what negative effect they are having on efforts to retain older mental health workers whose role is likely to be vital in keeping services going. </p> <p>The report, Finding and Keeping, comes a week after the annual conference of the Royal College of Psychiatrists heard dire warnings of the state of mental health care. Peter Kennedy, co-director of the Northern Centre for Mental Health, told the conference in Edinburgh: \"We have stood like rabbits in the headlights wondering what to do and where to start, knowing that the situation is worsening.

Overall, more than third of NHS trusts employing psychiatrists report trouble recruiting them and, at the last count, 14% of consultant posts were vacant. While the picture for mental health nurses looks rather better on paper, almost a quarter of them are aged 45-54 and many have the old \"mental health officer\" status, entitling them to retire on pension at 55. </p> <p>As if maintaining existing services is not challenging enough, the report estimates that the national service framework's standard of 24-hour access to care services might require an increase of 10-30% in staffing of community mental health teams alone - the equivalent of 1,000 extra nurses. Similarly, supporting just the 50,000 most hard-pressed informal carers, in line with the framework's ambitions, could require almost 1,700 more social workers. </p> <p>The attractions of working in mental health are not immediately obvious, however. Health and social care as a whole has problems competing for young recruits, but mental health suffers the added handi- cap of a negative image. \"Many of the staff we spoke to in the course of the review felt that mental health nursing was seen as a job with low pay and low status, but with high levels of risk,\" says the report. </p> <p>In view of this, the review team is urging a focus on retaining and making full use of older staff. But it says those who could be persuaded to stay on in their late 50s and 60s, perhaps on shorter hours or with a switch to a less pressured role, can be deterred by rules linking their pension to their final three years' salary. </p> <p>McCulloch, senior adviser to the Sainsbury centre, says: \"There is a big disincentive, almost an overwhelming one, to changing to a less high-powered job and a smaller disincentive to going part-time.

      "body": "<p>Diane Hewitt's relief on reading the note pushed under her door just about erased the stress of a sleepless night of worrying. It was from J, the 16-year-old girl she is fostering, and it read: \"I am really sorry I didn't come home last night but I was drinking with friends. The truth is I wasn't thinking about you at all - and I know you're thinking that, just as she is going well, she goes straight back down. But that's not true. I love being here with you and I thank you for all you are doing for me.\" </p> <p>Fostering can be full of dramas, but while there are thousands of teenagers in need of foster homes, carers like Hewitt are scarce. So scarce that John Hutton, the social care minister, is today launching a \u00a32m drive to find 7,000 more carers among those long overlooked as volunteers, and therefore least likely to offer: single people and ethnic groups. A website and a hotline, set up and run by the National Foster Care Association (NFCA), will be the main conduits. </p> <p>Fostering is a fraught field. Hardest to place are teenagers, and the need to find adults to offer a temporary replacement for family life is desperate. About two-thirds of the 50,000 children in the care system are fostered, but 60% of councils are seriously short of carers. In some London boroughs, up to a quarter drop out every year. </p> <p>This relatively high turnover is because people foster, on average, for three to five years. Youngsters typically stay with them for several weeks or months. Children have become more stressed and traumatised in recent times, which makes fostering more demanding, says NFCA's executive director, Gerri McAndrew. Even so, two-thirds are able to return to their families after six months. </p> <p>Fostering needs to be accepted as a \"much more mainstream\" activity, argues McAndrew. A bigger pool of volunteers will make it easier to match the needs of children to the skills of carers. </p> <p>Enter Hewitt. Two years ago, she gave up her career as a barrister to try caring. She's 52, single and was a trained nurse before she took up law. Though there wasn't a gap as such in her busy life, a long-term relationship had ended several years before, and at 50 - too late to have children - she considered fostering. It made sense: she had both time and financial security. And kids to her were hardly the aliens they are to some childless adults: she grew up in a family of 14 in Trinidad. Her legal work was a bonus: \"I'd come across so many youths who had been in trouble, I found I had a rapport with them,\" she says. </p> <p>J, the girl who gave her a sleepless night recently, is the fifth youngster placed with Hewitt by Wandsworth council, south London. She prefers to foster girls between 12 and 14 - before they get too wilful - but J had stayed with her before, when she was younger, so Hewitt bent her own rule and took her back four months ago. </p> <p>She takes one girl at a time. They have their evening meal together and, if they're watching TV, she encourages the girl to stay for at least the first five minutes of the news. There's an occasional touch of Caribbean scolding in the relationship: she accepts that J \"adores\" being out late, but that's balanced by the serious way J is taking her life skills course at college. </p> <p>Since Hewitt has got to know the childcare world, she sees several weaknesses in it. She's glad that more volunteers from ethnic groups are coming forward. But there are carers who treat their charges like lodgers. \"Some Afro-Caribbeans shouldn't be foster parents,\" she says. \"You cannot have a child in your home and just provide a TV, a stereo and meals on a tray in their bedroom.\" </p> <p>She thinks also that children should be able to talk freely to social workers calling for a home visit, without the foster carer hovering round and inhibiting frankness. </p> <p>But, in two areas, Hewitt reckons it's the fosterers who are sold short. Training courses and regular meetings for carers are all very well, but don't give the full picture. She was asked if she was prepared to take difficult kids, yet \"most of the videos were positive, and I didn't think the children were that damaged\". She was too optimistic: her front door has been smashed by an enraged teenager, and there have been 2am visits by police returning a runaway. </p> <p>Is all this work and worry worth it for the \u00a3500 she receives every two weeks from Wandsworth, one of the highest payers in London? </p> <p>Hewitt points out that the money is classed as expenses for providing for the child. As she still has income from legal and consultancy work, the issue of full remuneration matters less to her than other carers, she says. And while Hewitt understands the pressure for carers to be paid a proper salary, she is also slightly worried that it \"might attract the wrong kind of person\". </p> <p>Money certainly isn't a factor for Anthony Cross, who is 41, single and works in Fleetwood, Lancashire. Between the demands of his career as an NHS pensions administrator, and doing sport most evenings, he reckoned he could devote two weekends a month to respite care to youngsters. For taking one into his home for three nights, including food, entertainment and travel, Lancashire county council pays him \u00a334. </p> <p>All the other potential fosterers on his training course (six mornings) have now dropped out. For several, \"as soon as they realised they weren't going to get paid, they were off\". But to be fair to them, he says, they were interested in full-time placements, rather than just weekends. </p> <p>Cross persevered. As a result, he has \"seen every new film at the local Odeon, been to Alton Towers five times last year\", and to Blackpool more times than he can remember. He expects to be out of pocket, but that seems to be accepted by all parties. He doesn't cook - \"but I do microwave\" - so that means one or two restaurant meals in a weekend. </p> <p> Respite care is one of the niches which can take the strain when relationships with family are at breaking point. One teenager Cross currently is helping is epileptic, overweight, attends special school and lives with his grandmother. </p> <p>Cross could not become a full-time carer, but what he offers is useful: he plays and coaches badminton and tennis, and plays squash and swims. And he has bikes that don't stay unused for long on his respite weekends. </p> <p>But does taking a child for just one weekend a month help a teenager? Cross is sure it does. \"It gives a break to the child and the family,\" he says. \"It suits me and my lifestyle. Living on my own, with a full-time job, fostering full-time wouldn't be possible.\" However, the teenagers have improved in the several months he's known them. \"I like to think I've helped,\" he says. </p> <p>Cross plans to continue for as long as he can; Hewitt, though, reckons that she'll give up fostering after five years. Children's services may be lucky to have them, but they will need many more.</p> <p>\u0095 NFCA hotline: 0800 965985; website: <a href=\"http://www.fosteringnetwork.co.uk\">www.fosteringnetwork.co.uk</a></p>",

The truth is I wasn't thinking about you at all - and I know you're thinking that, just as she is going well, she goes straight back down. But that's not true. I love being here with you and I thank you for all you are doing for me.\" Fostering can be full of dramas, but while there are thousands of teenagers in need of foster homes, carers like Hewitt are scarce. So scarce that John Hutton, the social care minister, is today launching a \u00a32m drive to find 7,000 more carers among those long overlooked as volunteers, and therefore least likely to offer: single people and ethnic groups. A website and a hotline, set up and run by the National Foster Care Association (NFCA), will be the main conduits. Fostering is a fraught field. Hardest to place are teenagers, and the need to find adults to offer a temporary replacement for family life is desperate. About two-thirds of the 50,000 children in the care system are fostered, but 60% of councils are seriously short of carers. In some London boroughs, up to a quarter drop out every year. This relatively high turnover is because people foster, on average, for three to five years. Youngsters typically stay with them for several weeks or months. Children have become more stressed and traumatised in recent times, which makes fostering more demanding, says NFCA's executive director, Gerri McAndrew. Even so, two-thirds are able to return to their families after six months. Fostering needs to be accepted as a \"much more mainstream\" activity, argues McAndrew. A bigger pool of volunteers will make it easier to match the needs of children to the skills of carers. Enter Hewitt. Two years ago, she gave up her career as a barrister to try caring. She's 52, single and was a trained nurse before she took up law. Though there wasn't a gap as such in her busy life, a long-term relationship had ended several years before, and at 50 - too late to have children - she considered fostering. It made sense: she had both time and financial security. And kids to her were hardly the aliens they are to some childless adults: she grew up in a family of 14 in Trinidad. Her legal work was a bonus: \"I'd come across so many youths who had been in trouble, I found I had a rapport with them,\" she says. J, the girl who gave her a sleepless night recently, is the fifth youngster placed with Hewitt by Wandsworth council, south London. She prefers to foster girls between 12 and 14 - before they get too wilful - but J had stayed with her before, when she was younger, so Hewitt bent her own rule and took her back four months ago. She takes one girl at a time. They have their evening meal together and, if they're watching TV, she encourages the girl to stay for at least the first five minutes of the news. There's an occasional touch of Caribbean scolding in the relationship: she accepts that J \"adores\" being out late, but that's balanced by the serious way J is taking her life skills course at college. Since Hewitt has got to know the childcare world, she sees several weaknesses in it. She's glad that more volunteers from ethnic groups are coming forward. But there are carers who treat their charges like lodgers. \"Some Afro-Caribbeans shouldn't be foster parents,\" she says. \"You cannot have a child in your home and just provide a TV, a stereo and meals on a tray in their bedroom.\" She thinks also that children should be able to talk freely to social workers calling for a home visit, without the foster carer hovering round and inhibiting frankness. But, in two areas, Hewitt reckons it's the fosterers who are sold short. Training courses and regular meetings for carers are all very well, but don't give the full picture. She was asked if she was prepared to take difficult kids, yet \"most of the videos were positive, and I didn't think the children were that damaged\". She was too optimistic: her front door has been smashed by an enraged teenager, and there have been 2am visits by police returning a runaway. Is all this work and worry worth it for the \u00a3500 she receives every two weeks from Wandsworth, one of the highest payers in London? Hewitt points out that the money is classed as expenses for providing for the child. As she still has income from legal and consultancy work, the issue of full remuneration matters less to her than other carers, she says. And while Hewitt understands the pressure for carers to be paid a proper salary, she is also slightly worried that it \"might attract the wrong kind of person\". Money certainly isn't a factor for Anthony Cross, who is 41, single and works in Fleetwood, Lancashire. Between the demands of his career as an NHS pensions administrator, and doing sport most evenings, he reckoned he could devote two weekends a month to respite care to youngsters. For taking one into his home for three nights, including food, entertainment and travel, Lancashire county council pays him \u00a334. All the other potential fosterers on his training course (six mornings) have now dropped out. For several, \"as soon as they realised they weren't going to get paid, they were off\". But to be fair to them, he says, they were interested in full-time placements, rather than just weekends. Cross persevered. As a result, he has \"seen every new film at the local Odeon, been to Alton Towers five times last year\", and to Blackpool more times than he can remember. He expects to be out of pocket, but that seems to be accepted by all parties. He doesn't cook - \"but I do microwave\" - so that means one or two restaurant meals in a weekend. Respite care is one of the niches which can take the strain when relationships with family are at breaking point. One teenager Cross currently is helping is epileptic, overweight, attends special school and lives with his grandmother. Cross could not become a full-time carer, but what he offers is useful: he plays and coaches badminton and tennis, and plays squash and swims. And he has bikes that don't stay unused for long on his respite weekends. But does taking a child for just one weekend a month help a teenager? Cross is sure it does. \"It gives a break to the child and the family,\" he says. \"It suits me and my lifestyle. Living on my own, with a full-time job, fostering full-time wouldn't be possible.\" However, the teenagers have improved in the several months he's known them. \"I like to think I've helped,\" he says. Cross plans to continue for as long as he can; Hewitt, though, reckons that she'll give up fostering after five years. Children's services may be lucky to have them, but they will need many more. \u0095 NFCA hotline: 0800 965985; website: www.fosteringnetwork.co.uk",

Like The Who song, it seemed destined to die before it got old. But here it is, 30 years on, with founder Teddy Goldsmith in the process of handing over to his brother's son, Zac. And it's still in a rage - over Monsanto, globalisation, toxic chemicals, nuclear power and much more. </p> <p>The Ecologist began life in the glory days of the environment movement. It first hit the news stands in 1970, after Silent Spring, Rachel Carson's seminal book on pesticide poisoning, and Paul Ehrlich's doom-laden demographic vision, The Population Bomb, but before the first Earth Summit, at Stockholm in 1972. Its birth coincided with the emergence of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth and helped forge a global environmental movement. </p> <p>Goldsmith was the son of a Tory MP, elder brother of Jimmy, future financier and bosom pal of the gambling club owner and maverick zoo-keeper John Aspinall, who died recently. Teddy was a dropout anthropologist who devoted his twenties to travelling the world and campaigning to save endangered tribes. \"I began to realise that the survival of primitive peoples and of the environment were inseparable,\" he says. \"The root problem was economic development. So I decided to start a paper to explore these issues.\" </p> <p>Teddy has never believed in half measures. The first issue, published in July 1970, declared overpopulation to be the world's number one problem and proposed enforced sterilisation to halve the world's population. But his creation has enjoyed considerable skills in prophesy. That same first issue predicted an Alaskan oil spill two decades ahead of the Exxon Valdez and warned of a Chernobyl-like nuclear disaster. Meanwhile, in an early excursion on his lifelong search for a \"bio-ethic\", Teddy wrote on \"cybernetics, society and the ecosystem\" - creating an image of the planet as a single self-sustaining organism that pre-dated James Lovelock's first book on Gaia by nine years. </p> <p>Perhaps it was Teddy's French upbringing, but his magazine has always had more affinity with pyrotechnic intellectuals of the Parisian Left Bank than with the more sedate rubbish recyclers of Richmond in south-west London, where it was for many years produced. </p> <p>In its first months, the Ecologist compiled a Blueprint for Survival, a radical green manifesto that went on to sell 750,000 copies in paperback and kept the magazine financially afloat for years. The blueprint proposed the formation of a movement for political survival, which led directly to the creation of the People Party, later renamed the Ecology Party and finally the Green Party. </p> <p>The Ecologist has been first with many of the big environmental stories - often by many years. It was discussing global climate change during the African droughts of the mid-1970s. It revealed the torching of the Amazon rainforest in the early 1980s. It was the first to expose the worldwide social and environmental destruction from large dams - at a time when most greens still saw hydroelectricity as the key to a cleaner, greener future. </p> <p>It exposed the fallacy of cheap nuclear energy long before conventional economists tumbled to the truth. And it railed against the World Bank and the globalisation of world trade 15 years before Seattle. It poured scorn on the briefly fashionable \"green consumerism\". And it was producing cover features on the politics of seeds and the patenting of life back in the mid-1980s. In short, the modern green agenda has a striking resemblance to the Ecologist's back catalogue. </p> <p>Because it takes itself immensely seriously, the magazine has often been a hotbed of internal disputes. Teddy's flirtations with the far right have caused several colleagues to leave in disgust. An early article by Robert Allen, apparently backing Pol Pot's murderous Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, didn't go down too well. Nor has what stalwart Peter Bunyard calls \"Teddy's adherence to the notion that traditional societies alone have the key to sustainable living\". </p> <p>Such dogmatism attracted and later repelled Nick Hildyard, a student volunteer who came to be probably the second most influential person in the magazine's history. The eventual split between the two men in 1996 lit up a major schism within the environment movement itself. </p> <p>Goldsmith's approach, best exemplified by his belief in population control, is essentially authoritarian. But Hildyard turned the magazine for long periods into an anti-authoritarian mouthpiece for progressive community groups from around the world opposing the forces of globalisation - whether dam builders or seed companies or military juntas or timber companies.

      "body": "<p>It was late 1969 when my friend and comrade from the International Socialists, Paul Walton, suggested that we call round to a flat in Islington and meet Sheila Rowbotham, someone he described as a real-life radical feminist. </p> <p>There was nothing too intimidating about Sheila's appearance, but after 10 minutes in her company I began to have serious difficulty following the direction of her thoughts. I'd heard some feminists attack what they called \"the phallocentrism of traditional rationality\" but this hardly seemed to account for my host's tendency to lurch violently from one subject to another and then relapse into long periods of complete silence. </p> <p>After about half-an-hour of increasingly bizarre interaction, we made our excuses and left. \"What did you think?\" asked Paul. I confessed that, although I'd rather liked Sheila, I'd found it difficult to follow her conversation. \"Of course you did,\" said Paul dismissively. \"She was as high as a kite. Probably coming down from an acid trip.\" </p> <p>To judge from Sheila's recently published memoir of life in the 60s (Promise of Desire), Paul got it right.

      "bodyText": "It was late 1969 when my friend and comrade from the International Socialists, Paul Walton, suggested that we call round to a flat in Islington and meet Sheila Rowbotham, someone he described as a real-life radical feminist. There was nothing too intimidating about Sheila's appearance, but after 10 minutes in her company I began to have serious difficulty following the direction of her thoughts. I'd heard some feminists attack what they called \"the phallocentrism of traditional rationality\" but this hardly seemed to account for my host's tendency to lurch violently from one subject to another and then relapse into long periods of complete silence. After about half-an-hour of increasingly bizarre interaction, we made our excuses and left. \"What did you think?\" asked Paul. I confessed that, although I'd rather liked Sheila, I'd found it difficult to follow her conversation. \"Of course you did,\" said Paul dismissively. \"She was as high as a kite. Probably coming down from an acid trip.\" To judge from Sheila's recently published memoir of life in the 60s (Promise of Desire), Paul got it right. Although much of the book is a record of her political activities during this period, she happily admits to her fascination with acid. \"It intensified for me the capacity to see beauty in details which my eye would normally have passed over, and it deconstructed the customary.\" Ten years after I'd met Sheila, I went to California to make a television documentary about the 60s.

      "body": "<p>Some 4.4m low income households throughout Britain rely on housing benefit to pay for their basic accommodation costs. If the benefit goes unpaid, so does the rent. And with some 40% of claimants aged over 60, it is vital the system runs smoothly. So it is rather alarming to be told that, in some areas, the housing benefit system is in chaos. </p> <p>This is exactly the accusation made in a new report by the London Housing Federation (LHF), which is calling on the government to find immediate solutions. Failure to act swiftly, the housing body says, could leave rent arrears spiralling, \"causing tenants panic and distress and pushing some housing associations to the edge of bankruptcy\". </p> <p>Housing benefits administration is forcing its way on to the government's agenda. All around the country there have been reports of mounting backlogs of claims, towers of unanswered correspondence and threats of eviction to tenants over unpaid rent that they are in no position to pay because their housing benefit has not come through yet. Sheffield, Manchester, Taunton Deane in Somerset, Wyre in Lancashire and, in London, Lambeth and Hackney are just some of the councils where housing benefit problems have hit the front pages. But they are just the tip of the iceberg. And while the media attention has frequently focused on councils that have outsourced benefits administration, the problems are hitting services run both in the public and private sectors. </p> <p>According to the audit commission, just over half of councils nationally deliver an adequate housing benefit service. In London, the figure drops below 50%. The report from the LHF, which represents independent social landlords in the capital, reveals that just two in five of London's 33 boroughs are managing to meet housing benefit administration targets. The federation says this means that of the capital's 680,000 residents receiving housing benefit, just 270,000 are receiving payments consistently on time. The remaining 410,000 get an inadequate service, with many having to wait months for their benefit to be paid. </p> <p>The government accepts the scheme has its faults. But it is clear where it believes the real blame lies. Speaking at a conference in London last week, at which the federation'sreport was launched, junior social security minister Angela Eagle pointed the finger firmly at the councils that administer the scheme on behalf of government. She said: \"The delivery of housing benefit is complicated, can be confusing and is frequently time consuming. The benefit rules are complex for staff and claimants. The performance of local authorities who are responsible for delivering housing benefit is inconsistent. Some are excellent, others are appalling.\" </p> <p>But both housing providers and benefit administrators believe the government is failing to take its share of the blame. Jim Coulter, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, says: \"The government is in denial about its responsibility and trying to shift the blame on to local authorities.\" </p> <p>The new report says that some 85 regulation changes during 1999, instructed by government, have been a significant factor in the \"chaos\" that has been witnessed. That trend of constant change has been continued in 2000, with over 30 changes so far forced on councils. </p> <p>According to Gwyneth Taylor, housing policy officer at the Local Government Association, this \"drip drip\" of changes has slowly worn the system down. The changes, many related to the government's welfare-to-work agenda, are often relatively minor. But they still require staff training, software changes and new leaflets. \"Any other system that required two software changes a week couldn't cope,\" says Taylor. \"We acknowledge that there are differences in how local authorities are performing, but the government needs to acknowledge that part of that is due to them.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the biggest problem for councils over the last year has been a cumbersome new verification framework introduced last September. So far, some 250 out of the 409 benefit administering authorities around the country have signed up. Its purpose is to stamp out fraudulent claims and it requires claimants to provide proof of their identity, income, capital, household details and rent. This proof has to be demonstrated using original documents that, in practice, have to be presented in person. </p> <p>Ten authorities in the group of councils surveyed by the LHF had implemented what is known in housing circles as VF. Nine said it had had an adverse impact on the time taken to process claims. Six currently have backlogs, which they say were caused by the introduction of the anti-fraud measures. The funding to implement the framework has also proved inadequate, with some councils estimating that direct grant covers just 50% of the additional staffing costs. This has added to concerns that councils are already having to subsidise general administration costs. </p> <p>While benefit claimants are the main casualties of the problems, housing associations are suffering, too. Rising rent arrears have left many associations with cash flow problems. </p> <p>South London Family Housing Association manages some 8,000 homes, most of which are in the capital. \"Our rent from south London is \u00a322m a year,\" says Ben Wilson, the association's chief executive. \"At the moment, we have \u00a32.5m outstanding in arrears.\" That is more than double the 5% standard set by the Housing Corporation. In some areas, the association's problems are even more acute. For instance, in Lambeth the arrears due to the association from its 2,000 homes are a staggering 17-18% of the receivable rent. Wilson says the financial problems created by the benefit delays are making new housing development schemes unviable. </p> <p>Although Eagle accepts that the system has problems, she believes the government's recent housing green paper contains proposals to address these weaknesses. But housing leaders are unconvinced. In fact, they say proposals last year to simplify the benefits system were shelved while the green paper was worked up. And now the paper has arrived, Coulter describes the proposals on housing benefit as \"wishy-washy\". </p> <p>Taylor says the fundamental problem is that the scheme is \"not really administerable\" and, without change, there will always be problems. With last week's report and the recent high profile problems, councils, housing associations and tenants feel they have finally got the government's attention on housing benefit. What they want is a solution. And they want it now.</p> <p>\u0095 Reaping the Benefit: Improving Housing Benefit Administration in London is obtainable at \u00a310, plus \u00a32.50 p&amp;p, from the London Housing Federation, email: <a href=\"mailto:violetar@housing.org.uk\">violetar@housing.org.uk</a></p>",

This is explained by \"a decreased occurrence of the European corn borer, a particularly harmful pest in many parts of the American corn belt. This year's decrease in corn borer has made farmers decide not to buy GM seeds, which are in fact an 'insurance' against a problem which - at least this year - does not exist\".

They say this on the basis that the area of GM crops planted in the US this year is only marginally down on last year. There is, however, a big drop in GM maize from 28.3m acres to 19.9m. This is explained by \"a decreased occurrence of the European corn borer, a particularly harmful pest in many parts of the American corn belt. This year's decrease in corn borer has made farmers decide not to buy GM seeds, which are in fact an 'insurance' against a problem which - at least this year - does not exist\". The alternative possible explanation that farmers may plant normal seed because they are not confident of selling GM maize to food or fodder companies is not considered. Eternal flame A flame lit from the fire caused by the Hiroshima atomic bomb on August 6, 1945, made a brief appearance on stage at the Glastonbury festival with a Japanese band called the Tenkoo Orchestra. The band obtained special permission to take a light from the perpetual flame burning in Japan and bring an offshoot to England. The band leader, Hiroki Okano, is now looking for a responsible body of peaceniks or monks to become guardians of the flame in Britain.",

From my perspective as a care worker who works with learning disabilities on a daily basis, the government and, indeed, our own management are trying to get us to do the impossible. Not only are they rightly trying to get as much day service activity for the clients as possible, they also expect us to write out elongated reports on what we do. Why are we doing the activity? What is its ultimate goal? How it went? Whether it is worth doing again? Then there are reports at the end of each month, risk assessment criteria, updating all policy and procedures, taking part in periodical reviews, going on training courses - and writing reports on them. Accuse me of being cyncial, but with all the paperwork we have to do, we could happily spend all day preparing for an activity and never actually do it.

      "body": "<p>Bobbie was 13 when she discovered that the man she thought was her brother was really her father, and the woman she thought was her mother was really her grandmother. It didn't stop there. The woman in a frame on the wall was not, as she had been told, an aunt who lived far away in India. She was her real mother. What's more, she had committed suicide when Bobbie was a baby. </p> <p>Confused? Not half as much as Bobbie was when these brutal facts of her life were blurted out, in the heat of a family argument, by another \"brother\", who turned out to be an uncle. It was a devastating catalogue of deception to pile on to the shoulders of a budding adolescent - albeit one who was hardly innocent of the cruel complexities of an adult world. She had been sexually abused from the age of five by the man she had thought was her father but who was, of course, her grandfather. </p> <p>Thirty years on from learning the truth about her mother, Bobbie is curled up on the sofa in her council house, talking with remarkable composure about her life as a victim and survivor of almost unimaginable emotional turmoil. \"Mine is an unusually intense and ugly story,\" she says, \"but I'm still here to tell it.\" This is despite four suicide attempts, despite savage beatings by men and despite her own apparent need to hurt herself physically, sometimes banging her head against a wall until it bled. </p> <p>She started self-harming in her teens. \"At first I would go into the toilet to pinch and scratch myself so that the pain on the outside would temporarily shift the focus from the pain inside,\" she says. Her real name is Kusum Wason. She was born in Nairobi, to Indian parents, 43 years ago. The family moved to London when she was 11. Bobbie is the name she took on during her time as a \"flirtatious\" dancer, and it stuck. It's what she chooses to be called in a television documentary for the East series, to be shown next Monday on BBC2. Two other, younger women are also featured. All three are self-harmers. All three are Asian. </p> <p>Statistics show that Asian women are three times more likely than their white counterparts to attempt suicide. And when the Newham Asian Women's Project, in east London, analysed those attending its counselling and mental health support groups, it found that three out of five were inflicting physical pain upon themselves. Some cut themselves with razors or knives. Others would scald themselves with irons or pummel walls with their fists. </p> <p>The project's patron is the actress, writer and comedienne Meera Syal, who says she was pleased to be asked to present the TV documentary. \"I'm becoming more and more concerned about Asian women and what's happening to us in this country,\" she says. \"It's shocking that the incidences are so high in such a specific group at a time when the same group is being applauded for its achievements in education.\" </p> <p>So why is it happening? The reasons put forward by Anjum Mouj, chair of the Newham project, are \"domestic violence, neglect and sexual abuse in childhood\". But those factors could apply to any number of women from all backgrounds. Over and above these wellsprings of discontent are other factors to which Asian women are particularly vulnerable. </p> <p>One is racism. A young woman called Humerah tells Syal how, when she was 14, she would be alone in the house during school holidays. \"The National Front people used to ring up and give me delightful messages.\" She goes on to say: \"I just thought I'd try out what the razor was really like because I just felt so numb, so alone and pretty desperate... It just made me feel something, and that was important.\" </p> <p>Isolation is another factor, sometimes coupled with an identity crisis. Sita was separated from her brothers and sisters at 13, after her mother had a mental breakdown, and sent to live with white foster parents. \"The message they were giving me was that it was wrong to be Asian... I still don't know who I am,\" she says as the camera closes in on her face and her big eyes glisten with imminent tears. </p> <p>There is one other factor which makes Asian women prone to low self-esteem and, consequently, at higher risk of self-harming: they were born female in a community where it is still common for male offspring to be valued more highly. </p> <p>Bobbie knows all about that, and tells me what it has meant for her. \"Girls are not looked upon favourably in our culture,\" she says. \"Once I found out about my mother, I was told that she killed herself because of me. The rest of my family regarded me as a jinx.\" </p> <p>Until comparatively recently, her life has been like the improbable plot of a harrowing melodrama. At 17, she had two children, and a mother-in-law who insisted on keeping them from her. Bobbie was shown the door. She had short spells of homelessness and alcohol abuse, drifting from one violent relationship to another. </p> <p>Her current partner, Navid, has proved to be a rarity in her chaotic life: a kind man. And she appears to be blossoming as a result. The mental legacy will always be there, but she now confines any self-harming to poking at her ears, occasionally and surreptitiously. She knows that banging her head against a wall would alarm the three children who still live at home. \"My kids provide my energy source,\" she says, proudly. </p> <p>Certainly, she seems to exude an inner strength which is now being put to wider use. She is active in the local tenants' association and wants to stand as a Labour councillor in the next elections. Meanwhile, she's working as a counsellor for the Southall Black Sisters, trying to help other women who are harming themselves. \"I know what they're going through because I've been there myself,\" she says. She knows what it's like to be abused, rejected and so angry inside that physical pain seems like the only diversion from mental torture. </p> <p>\"I'm still angry with my family and my community,\" she says. \"I used to be angry with my mother for not being there for me. Now I just feel sad for her. When I help a young girl to give up suicidal feelings, I find myself talking to my mother afterwards. 'There you go, mum,' I say. 'One more for you. Your death wasn't in vain'.\"</p> <p>\u0095 East: Suffering in Silence is on BBC2 next Monday at 7.30pm.</p>",

His father had been a Sergeant of Hussars in the Boer War, but never before had anybody in our family gained a King's Commission. </p> <p>After 30 years of soldiering, Dad couldn't bear to be out of uniform and so he joined the War Department police as a constable. He and Mum lived in police quarters and he worked shifts for 15 years. </p> <p>At 65, Dad had to retire again. They moved to a small house in the Cambridgeshire village where Mum had been born, and he got a job on the production line at a radio assembly plant, working there full time. </p> <p>At 70, retirement was again forced upon him, but immediately he got a job as a warehouseman for a golfing goods distributor, where he worked for 10 years. </p> <p>By the time he was 80, we had all begun to realise that, for Dad, retirement was just another word for unemployment. Mum had now gone into hospital with senile dementia, and he had moved into a Royal British Legion apartment near Cambridge. \"Now what am I going to do?\" he wrote to us. </p> <p>We had a letter duplicated for him. In essence it read: \"Dear Neighbour, I am an old age pensioner with time on my hands. If there are any odd jobs you'd like me to do, please telephone.\" </p> <p>He put 50 of these through letter boxes of local houses, and almost immediately his phone began to ring. \"Can you walk my dogs, dig some potatoes, clean my silver, watch my house, etc?\" He began a paper round, and a local school employed him to clean two classrooms each day.

      "bodyText": "Dad retired on an army pension at the age of 50. During the war, he had been promoted from sergeant-major to captain. Mum was so proud. His father had been a Sergeant of Hussars in the Boer War, but never before had anybody in our family gained a King's Commission. After 30 years of soldiering, Dad couldn't bear to be out of uniform and so he joined the War Department police as a constable. He and Mum lived in police quarters and he worked shifts for 15 years. At 65, Dad had to retire again. They moved to a small house in the Cambridgeshire village where Mum had been born, and he got a job on the production line at a radio assembly plant, working there full time. At 70, retirement was again forced upon him, but immediately he got a job as a warehouseman for a golfing goods distributor, where he worked for 10 years. By the time he was 80, we had all begun to realise that, for Dad, retirement was just another word for unemployment. Mum had now gone into hospital with senile dementia, and he had moved into a Royal British Legion apartment near Cambridge. \"Now what am I going to do?\" he wrote to us. We had a letter duplicated for him. In essence it read: \"Dear Neighbour, I am an old age pensioner with time on my hands. If there are any odd jobs you'd like me to do, please telephone.\" He put 50 of these through letter boxes of local houses, and almost immediately his phone began to ring. \"Can you walk my dogs, dig some potatoes, clean my silver, watch my house, etc?\" He began a paper round, and a local school employed him to clean two classrooms each day. To get the job he'd declared his age as 68. Twice weekly he made the six-mile round trip by bicycle to visit Mum in hospital. She always greeted him with a kiss and a smile, but she didn't know him; she thought he was her brother. At 85, dad was finding the cold winter mornings a bit tough and decided to give up his paper round. The local newspaper printed a story about Cambridge's oldest paper boy calling it a day. There he was, pictured with a huge smile, in his old raincoat, his bike beside him. But, two weeks later, he started up again and continued for two more years. By the time he was 87, Mum had died and Dad had fallen off his bike on his way back from the pub.

      "body": "<p>Swopping urban bricks and mortar for a home set in neat, well-tended grounds in the countryside has a certain appeal - particularly if the new home is cheaper than the old one, freeing up a bit of capital for retirement. Two-thirds of the country's 200,000 residents of \"park homes\", formerly known as mobile homes, are elderly. Their 60x20ft homes are either two large caravans put together or wooden huts on wheels which usually make only one journey, from the factory. </p> <p>But all is not well in these garden gnome-fringed, mainly white, working-class idylls; park home land is green, but the atmosphere can be far from pleasant, and some of those who dreamed of a tranquil new life find they are unprotected in law and being mercilessly exploited by site owners. Investigation into the problems encountered by residents has thrown up horrific evidence from pensioners who said they had had excrement smeared over their homes, or had seen site owners patrolling with baseball bats. At the beginning of this month, some park home residents handed in a petition to No 10, coinciding with a campaign launched by homelessness magazine the Big Issue. </p> <p>Today, a consultation report by a park homes working party is published by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR). It makes plain that the park home industry, which currently comes under the woefully inadequate 1983 Mobile Home Act, is crying out for proper regulation. </p> <p>Problems of regulation have arisen because a mobile home is considered a chattel (because it has wheels) and not a property, which means residents are not protected under property law. Some vulnerable, retired residents are suffering intimidation, extortion and bullying at the hands of unscrupulous site owners who can charge what they like in rent, maintenance and repairs. </p> <p>Colin Packman, of the Independent Park Homes Advisory Service which helps residents in difficulty, says: \"The trouble is, we're a small number spread out over the country, so we're not a vote winner.\" Philip Kenny, head of law at the University of Northumbria, has campaigned for years for improvements to the law for the residents of Britain's 1,300 park homes. He has described ownership of a park home site as a licence to print money. </p> <p>Kenny, who has worked with homelessness charity Shelter on the park homes issue, says: \"Pitch fees, or ground rents, are often put up arbitrarily by site owners. Most people wouldn't think a \u00a330 increase is a lot of money, but to many retired people it makes a difference between having treats and not. They are often timorous, elderly folk who'd rather give in and have a quiet life. The ones who get to court find the owners employ expensive lawyers and they can't afford to compete.\" </p> <p>Pitch fees are around \u00a370-\u00a3150 a month and residents pay between \u00a340,000 and \u00a380,000 for a park home, although some luxury homes can reach the \u00a3180,000 mark. And here's the rub. The 1983 act allows mobile home owners to sell their home on site - the value is in the location, not the home itself - but there is no sanction to prevent site owners interfering, perhaps by putting off prospective owners. </p> <p>Residents who need to sell up - to go into a nursing home, for example - can end up selling their home for peanuts to the site owner, who then buys a brand new home for \u00a320,000 and sells it for \u00a380,000 to a new resident. High turnover means more profit, which is why some of these landlords are intimidating residents off their sites. Most landlords ban residents' associations. </p> <p>Another classic site owner's money-spinner is to supply Calor Gas at an extortionate price and then interfere with competitors' deliveries. One resident insisted on using an alternative gas supplier, so the site owner went to court to get his pitch fee increased to cover his \"losses\". Kenny says: \"It's the only industry where you can actually get compensation for an extortion you failed to extract.\" </p> <p>The park homes working party was set up by the DETR in 1998 after homeowners drew attention to the serious tensions between residents and site owners. Members include bodies representing site owners and residents, the Local Government Association, the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and the Office of the National Assembly for Wales, with the DETR as chair. </p> <p>Their report has made 30 recommendations for change covering rules on sale of homes, provision of written statements, termination of agreements, harassment, site licensing by local authorities, pitch fees and commission rates. Ministers are due to consider implementation of the recommendations after the consultation deadline of October but even then, changes to the existing regulations could require primary and secondary legislation, so slowing the process even further. </p> <p>The National Park Homes Council, one of two bodies representing the mobile home parks, and a member of the working party, welcomes today's report but would have liked to have seen recommendations for an independent ombudsman for mobile home owners, as there is in the housing sector. Pauline Bruton, vice-chair, says: \"It is a minority of site owners who are finding loopholes and using them to their own ends, but we want these people out of the industry because it is tarnishing all of us.\" </p> <p> \u0095 One month before the sale of a mobile home, a statement must be signed by both parties, in the presence of witnesses. </p> <p>\u0095 Breaches of agreements which then become null and void owing to the condition of a home will apply only to its exterior (to avoid intimidating \"surveys\"). </p> <p>\u0095 Residents' associations, meeting specific criteria, should be encouraged, with rights to information from site owners. </p> <p>\u0095 Price information of all utilities must be available to residents, and a statutory maximum price introduced for the re-sale of gas. </p> <p>\u0095 The Caravan Sites Act be amended to protect against harassment and illegal eviction. </p> <p>\u0095 The government to identify a maximum level of site owner commission on goods and services supplied, and decide how pitch fees will be set. </p> <p>\u0095 Tightening up on park home licensing. </p> <p>\u0095 Mobile homes should not come under housing law, as they would then be subject to building regulations which could drive park owners out of the industry.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Chapter One: Discovery</strong> (cont/d)</p> <p> I have a geological memoir for the Boscastle area tucked into my jacket pocket. From the geological map which sketches out the pattern of the outcrops of the rocks I can see something of the tectonic agony which is so patent in the cliffs: rock formations twist and turn over the mapped ground, which is criss-crossed by faults. I can identify exactly where I am standing, on the outcrop of the Boscastle Formation; in the dry language of science the slates are described as early Carboniferous (what in the US would be called Mississippian). This corner of the world has an extremely ancient origin, older than mammals, older even than dinosaurs. These black slates would already have carried their contorted signature as a guarantee of antiquity when Tyrannosaurus was king of the hill. When they were first laid down there were only tree ferns and cockroaches and cumbrous amphibians on land. Can there be a better place to reflect upon the vastness of geological time? </p> <p> The erosion which I can both see and hear is ineffably slow. I could stand here all my life and notice little difference to the cliffs. Maybe a chasm excavated along a fault might seem subtly darker as its girth increased after an exceptional storm. Perhaps a rock fall would leave a scar cleared of campion and grass. But I am certain that when Thomas Hardy stood on this spot he would have gazed upon a comparable scene; my eyes now see what his once saw. To be sure, the vegetation would have changed, but the geological signature of the cliffs would have been legible in much the same way. How can we conceive of the time needed to wear away these cliffs to nothing, to convert all the massed slates into fine silt, quartz veins into pebbles - at first angular, then worn by the constant shuffling of the sea rounder and rounder, until they acquire the contours and colours of a hen's egg? Millennia are irrelevant, species come and go, and still the cliffs stand obstinate against the inroads of time. Yet given enough time even this rampart that seems to stand so unflinchingly against the surf will be reduced to nothing, and the flagstones on the floor of the Cobweb Inn will return to sediment, joining all the other works of Man, committed once again to the great cycle of change. Rocks are eroded to sediment: sediment is hardened to rock; rock is elevated above sea level by movements of the Earth, transformed by tectonics; and, thus raised, is once more subject to the assault of the elements. This is the great wheel of the Earth. If Gustav Mahler had taken the geological view, Das Lied von der Erde (The Song of the Earth) would have been a cycle of erosion and reconstruction endlessly reiterated, enough to try the patience even of those who admire the most mantric of symphonies. </p> <p> Cornwall once formed part of a vast mountain chain. It marked one end of the Hercynides, which snaked through Europe just as the Alps do today in the south. The patent folding of the rocks was the result of the slates being trapped in a great tectonic vice that showed no mercy. Rocks buckled, in an attempt to accommodate forces that were irresistible. Every tiny ruckle in the wall of Pentargon Bay is the legacy of suffering under a rule of tectonics so mighty that no mere rock could stand against the imperative of crustal stress. When the rocks were folded, structure was piled upon structure until mountains resulted. Clever geologists from the University of Exeter, like E. B. Selwood, have spent years trying to unpick the buckling. They have interpreted this stretch of coast not as merely folded, but as divided into great slices of crust which have slid over and past one another. Squeezed rocks could not absorb the forces by contortion alone, and were compelled to fracture. To attain equilibrium, vast broken slabs of rock larger than a parish slid away from the centre of the forces at a low angle, like the twisted thorn branches leaning away from the reach of the sea wind. Under the sole of these sliding masses weaker rocks were folded over and over, crumpled like a pack of playing cards in the hands of a ruined gambler. Every crack that was opened up, as the country was ground beneath the tectonic wheel, would be filled with vein quartz. Now, the eroded remains of these mountains lay before me. The lichen-covered stone walls were fabricated from the relics of ancient Alps. The farmer who orientated the slaty slabs with such care was conniving with tectonic forces of which he probably knew nothing. </p> <p> Not many miles to the south, near Bodmin, a granite tor rises above the general plain. It is reminiscent of some stepped Mayan pyramid, not least in scale, but is entirely natural. The strange pile of enormous blocks is what remains behind when granite is weathered over many thousands of years. Even granite eventually succumbs to the onslaught of the elements, rain and wind and frost. But granite endures longer than shale, as I was to see in St Juliot's churchyard, not far away. Granite, too, is part of the narrative of the vanished mountain chain, although its source was utterly different from the shales of the Cornish cliffs. It was crystallized from a liquid magma, hot and invasive, within the deep heart of the former chain. Look now: you can see big crystals of felspar, and maybe the sparkle of mica. These crystals tell the story of how a mountain chain drives crumpled rocks so deep into the Earth's crust that they melt, and brew a buoyant, hot broth of liquid minerals, which once more rises through the crust to crystallize and solidify as granite batholiths and plutons. Granite lies at depth beneath the Cornish peninsula, reaching to the surface under the boggy stretches of Dartmoor and Bodmln. At the moment of their formation, some of the crystals set in motion radioactive clocks. Precise modern instruments can now assess the ticking of geological time as it is recorded by decaying radioactive isotopes of uranium or potassium (and several other elements besides) contained in the substance of the crystals. This method provides the answer to that difficult question: how much time has passed? The decay rate is known: it is only a matter of exact measurement and careful calculation to obtain the date of the mineral's formation. If the Bodmin granites were intruded into the folded rocks, then it follows that the granites must postdate the folding. The crystals act almost like eyes that let us see into the past, to calibrate it, to fix it in our vision. So if the crystal age of the granite was 300 million years, it fixes our cliffs as older still - the black slates must have already been folded before the granites were intruded. </p> <p> As to the soft muds which were eventually hardened and distorted into the black slates, they were deposited on a Carboniferous sea-floor, as long as 340 million years ago. Time hardened them, tectonics twisted them, granites punished them with plutonic heat, long before they came to form the cliffs which now make sites for the inaccessible nests of fulmars and kittiwakes. But messages can be passed on from that ancient sea: messages in the shape of fossils. When the sea-floor was young, shells of many kinds of animals lay littered among the muds and sands, just as clam shells can be found stranded on a beach today. These were mostly ordinary, small creatures, snails and brachiopods and the like. Their shells became incorporated into the sediment as more fine mud rained down upon them: mud originated from the erosion of an ancient landmass, which itself was the product of a previous cycle of Earth history. This is how the story of the world turns and turns again. With the passage of time - much more time - the shells were still there as the muds became deeply buried, and then hardened into shales when water was driven out. Perhaps the substance of the shells was augmented by a subtle infiltration of minerals at this time. Their original colours were leached away, a time-change that bleached shells of brightness, converting them to fossil-colour: they became stony simulacra of once-living creatures. </p> <p> Their journey had only just begun. The Carboniferous sea in which animals once flourished and left their shelly tokens was consumed in the engine of plate tectonics. Rocks and fossils alike - the accumulated legacy of the sea - were passengers on a great journey. Many of the fossils were doomed to obliteration. They might be dragged to the centre of the growing Hercyman chain, fated to be squeezed or baked beyond recognition. They might be dissolved away. They might be chopped into pieces as the rocks carrying them recrystallized. Mountains grew over south-west England, great slabs of country were shrugged sideways in the melee. Granites insinuated themselves into the depths. As soon as the mountains were born, they were destined to die by erosion, so, most likely of all, the fossils could be worn away to an impalpable mash that was already on a journey to the next Earth cycle. We must marvel at the fossil survivors, their chutzpah in the face of the orogenic enemy. </p> <p> Sealed in the aftermath of tectonics, the fossils still had to survive all that followed: the rendering of a mountain chain once more into the sea. Through more than 200 million years the Hercyman relic was ground down to its roots. It is certain that the granites reached the surface at a time when dinosaurs were still lumbering over the Weald and western Europe, for curious and distinctive minerals derived from these granites are found for the first time in rocks laid down in Cretaceous times, about 100 million years ago. Like a geological striptease, veils of rock were stripped slowly away to ever more fundamental levels within the ancient chain. Eventually it was stripped naked to its interior, and the show was over. What I was looking at in Pentargon Cliff was one of the inner veils, preserved from obliteration, with its strata still crumpled like discarded chiffon. </p> <p> What fossils might survive in the dark slates? What miracles of endurance might they record, what cheating of the laws of chance? How could a wanderer along this slippery path high above the everlasting sea truly comprehend what is meant by the vastness of geological time, even though the evidence is everywhere displayed? Looking down on Boscastle I could almost capture the historical past - I could 'see' it as one might episodes from half-remembered movies. It is not difficult to paint a mental picture of Hardy on this path. Or to envisage, more than a century ago, filthy slate miners tottering off to the inn of their choice, with the gentry nearby spry in traps; or to conjure up a bustling Tudor port with heavy-rigged ships sheltering from the wildness of the sea in the safe haven, talk of the Armada in the runs, costumes out of Holbein; I can even visualize an Iron Age farmer's tilth and husbandry, and the discomfort of a November day like this in a simple, smoke-filled dwelling. My vision is full of details rooted in shared humanity, set in bric-a-brac drawn from memory plausibly arranged. But to quantify the geological time required for the formation of Cornwall I need to multiply time a thousand-fold, and then perhaps nearly a thousand times again. I am as accustomed to writing figures in millions (of years) as is a Swiss banker (in dollars), yet the lines of zeros do not translate in proportion. Just as the average working man can understand exactly the purchasing power of fifty bucks, and fifty thousand is probably comprehensible, 500,000,000 has an approximate feel to it - surely, it's a fortune, but what does it mean? A lottery wm of 5 million is a lot, but then, so is 22 million. We reel away from such vertiginous figures, we can envisage a huge pile of money, notes piled on notes, but we cannot comprehend its true magnitude. If our intention is to see so far into a past of many millions we shall need to develop a special way of seeing, a spyglass trained on former worlds. We will need to cultivate an indifference to magnitude, so that a million years becomes not, after all, such a long stretch of time. We will need to read rocks and cliffs as if they were books, and not shudder at the heights. </p> <p> I have passed the steep side of Pentargon Cliff. Some kind soul has carved steps to ease the climb, but even so I am out of breath by the time the path levels off. It now follows a course along the middle of a steep, grassy slope, and is very slippery. There is a curious sense of suspension; the sea is far below, but the slope conceals the vast cliffs which I know must be there. I can still hear the sea clearly enough: there is an irregular bang! bang! as waves punish a sea cave along the invisible surf-line, but the great height I have now reached feels almost illusory, as if I were ambling along some unspecified stratum floating between sea and sky. I have reached Beeny Cliff, and I am grateful that the light has not yet started to weaken. A few drops of rain hit me hard in the neck. A flock of gulls suddenly rises up from beyond the cliff edge, buoyed by the updraught and mewling hysterically. The end of my walk makes me turn up my collar, and shiver. </p> <p> Beeny Cliff is the scene of a terrifying episode in Hardy's novel A Pair of Blue Eyes. Stephen Knight follows the same path that I had just completed, in the company of Elfride, the first of Hardy's complex, closely-observed women heroines. Knight is a man of scientific bent. Perhaps seeking to display his knowledge - or maybe just to satisfy his curiosity - he attempts to demonstrate the contrariwise circulation of the air currents up the face of the cliff: 'an inverted cascade ... as perfect as Niagara Falls - but rising instead of falling, and air instead of water' He leaps on to the slope, below the path, and his hat is caught by the countercurrent; in a foolish attempt to retrieve it he slips down the appalling incline. He ends up dangling desperately at the edge of the cliff-face itself; Hardy describes the black slates with some precision. Here it is that Knight comes face to face with the subject of this book. </p> <p> \"By one of those familiar conjunctions of things wherewith the reanimate world baits the mind of man when he pauses in moments of suspense, opposite Knight's eyes was an imbedded fossil, standing forth in low relief from the rock. It was a creature with eyes. The eyes, dead and turned to stone, were even now regarding him, It was one of the early crustaceans called Trilobites. Separated by millions of years in their lives, Knight and this underling seem to have met in their place of death. It was the single instance within reach of anything that had been alive and had had a body to save, as he himself had now.\" </p> <p> In this bleak spot, where I was gazing out towards the precipice between the wrinkled sea below and the darkening sky above, trilobites made a brief appearance in English literature. The path above Beeny Cliff was where two paths of my own life - trilobites and writing - uniquely intersected. I felt compelled to visit the place; and I was not disappointed. The eyes of the trilobite, 'turned to stone', provided the image I needed to guide the reader through this book, which will try to see the world through the eyes of fossils as a means to animate the past. Equally, I was intrigued by the difference between the novelist's truth, which has nothing to do with testability and everything to do with the impact of the work on the mind and emotions, and scientific truth, which has everything to do with testability, but also with the emotions of discovery - many of them the stuff of novels. </p> <p> So to what extent was Hardy telling the truth? Hardy was writing his novel originally as a serial - he needed to keep his readers enthralled, episode by episode. Knight's predicament was a cliffhanger in the most literal sense. How can you have more suspense than to leave your character exactly suspended? The trilobite eyes provided a focus for Knight's near-nemesis; while human eyes - blue ones - provided both the title and emotional motor for the novel. The critic Pamela Dalziel has noticed how the plot twists upon 'spying' of one kind or another. The book is soaked with the implications of sight. </p> <p> I was interested to see how closely Hardy had observed the setting for his cliff-hanging episode. Scholars have identified the location from many details from his early life. While he was still employed as an architect restoring St Juliot's Church in 1870, he met his future wife, Emma Gifford, who was the sister-in-law of the Rector. Locations in the area are rather thinly disguised, and it evidently lies well to the west of the rest of Hardy's Wessex. A Pair of Blue Eyes included more autobiographical elements than his other novels, and perhaps for that reason evidently remained dear to his heart (he rewrote parts of it many years later). The height of the cliff itself is rather pedantically described, even as poor Knight flounders, surely indicating that the young writer had gazetteers open, and a sharpened pencil in front of him as he catalogued its statistics: 'proved by actual measurement not to be a foot less than six hundred and fifty [feet] ... three times the height of Flamborough, a hundred feet higher than Beachy Head ... thrice as high as the Lizard' (and there is more in this vein). But what left me in no doubt at all about the site was the walk I had taken, which was duplicated exactly by the characters in the novel. Hardy had observed what was evidently the same waterfall plunging to obscurity that I had seen at Pentargon Bay, 'running over the precipice it was dispersed in spray before it was half way down, and falling like rain upon projecting ledges made minute grassy meadows of them'. He described the threatening cliffs, with their 'horrid personality' at the same point as I had seen them on my walk. In many respects passages in the novel could be described as reportage: he could recognize both quartz and slate, he recounted physical features in order along the path, he knew some geology and meteorology. While Knight clung to the cliff face his mind raced back through geological time - a series of tableaux of the past succeeded one another in his desperate mind all the way back to the ancient time of the trilobites. It is not a bad account, scientifically speaking, of the succession of life through geological time as conceived about 1860. </p> <p> But now we reach a point at which fiction and description take off along different paths; perhaps the fascination of the novel lies in these deviations. Why did Hardy refer to Beeny Cliff as The Cliff with No Name? The hamlet of Beeny is clearly named on old maps and he was usually adept at near-synonyms - Camelton for Camelford, Dundagel for Tintagel. I believe that 'No Name' adds to the horror and mystery of the place. The same point was appreciated by Sergio Leone: in his brooding spaghetti westerns 'The Man with No Name', played by Clint Eastwood, was the anti-hero. Naming is the first way we domesticate our surroundings; we would expect the highest cliff along the coast to have a name. Anonymity is horror. When a series of murders are committed terror is at its worst while the perpetrator is still unknown: a case of nameless dread. The fabricator of fiction knew this; this is where artifice comes in. Hardy liked facts, but he knew also when to suspend them. The trilobite itself is a convenient fiction. The Carboniferous rocks on this part of the Cornish coast have yielded no trilobites. The rocks are of the right age, so there is no theoretical objection to finding trilobites there. Fossils are very rare from such tectonically tortured rocks. Enough have been found - precursors of ammonites, clams, microscopic fossils - to establish the geological age, but trilobites are not among them. I would be absolutely delighted to receive a trilobite from a collector lucky enough to hammer one out of these unpromising strata; it would be of appreciable scientific importance. Hardy placed the fossil in the right geological setting, but the finding of a trilobite is an invention. He needed the trilobite to stare out Stephen Knight. As readers of fiction we relish his use of this particular fossil, 'but a low type of animal existence', as heightening the drama of the situation. It matters not a jot that the occurrence is fictional, even though the rest of Hardy's account is an almost photographic reproduction of a real scene. A scientist would be appalled if one of his colleagues invented such an occurrence, for science trades on the truth - nothing but the objective fact. The truth of the artist can recombine the facts of the world in the service of creation, but the scientist has a different duty, to discover the truth lying behind the facade of appearance. Both processes may be equally imaginative. </p> <p> As for Mr Knight, he escaped his predicament thanks to a rope, but a rope desperately manufactured from Elfride's undergarments. It is a turning point in the novel, symbolizing a change in the relationship between a flawed man and an unusual woman. And we are not compelled to wonder whether such an episode was fact or not, because it is woven into the fabric of a novel. </p> <p> I left Beeny Cliff by climbing up the steep steps to Fire Beacon Point, a wild bluff commanding views of the whole Hercynian coast. It may have acquired its name as one of numerous beacons on which fires were lit to warn of the approach of an armada. Now, there is only a bench at the top dedicated to the memory of Paul C. Heard, but I thanked Mr Heard's relatives for the chance to rest and regain my breath. I turned inland, following an old, walled track. I wanted to see the parish church of St Juliot on which Hardy had worked. It is perfectly set on a sheltered hillside, and behind it a track leads out directly across fields upon which sheep graze unhurriedly. Despite the setting, there is something depressingly foursquare and Victorian about St Juliot's - possibly the fault of Hardy's restoration - including a rather dumpy tower with unnecessary castellation. It is as if the site deserved something much more distinguished to live up to its associations. After all, Hardy wrote that 'much of my life claims the spot as its key'. Surely it is an ancient holy place, which the church fails adequately to honour. In the graveyard there are several 'Jollows' - possibly a bastardized version of the name Juliot - the kind of family that must have grown out of the local soil as surely as wind-blown gorse. Inside the church there is a notice informing the visitor that most of the church plate has already been stolen. There was nothing to induce me to linger. </p> <p> But as I left I saw the Celtic crosses, more ancient than the church itself. Close by the gate one crudely shaped column as high as a man stands sentinel; its apex is sculpted into a disc, and you might expect to find some sort of face hewn upon it, but instead there is a schematic cross. Unlike the slatey gravestones, these upright crosses are made from granite. They will endure when all the inscribed memorials to Jollows have crumbled into the same soil that long since claimed their bones. The granite was derived from one of the igneous intrusions into the bowels of the Hercynian mountain range. Maybe the blocks were derived from Bodmin or Dartmoor, but whatever the source their hewers knew about permanence. Each monument acknowledges the vast span of geological time, the durability of stone compared with a human lifetime. Each is a symbol of the crossing of human intention with tectonic history - the same history that placed Hardy's plausible but fictional trilobite into Beeny Cliff. The discoidal apex of the cross is like an eyepiece with a view clear back to the age of the tree ferns and lungfishes. This, after all, may have been what I wanted to discover on a chilly November day in Boscastle. I felt a curious elation, even as the icy raindrops began to refresh the lichens that alone could derive sustenance from incorruptible granite - set solid ever since trilobites had patrolled the shallows of a vanished ocean. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters/story/0,6761,342556,00.html\">More</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Chapter One: Discovery (cont/d) I have a geological memoir for the Boscastle area tucked into my jacket pocket. From the geological map which sketches out the pattern of the outcrops of the rocks I can see something of the tectonic agony which is so patent in the cliffs: rock formations twist and turn over the mapped ground, which is criss-crossed by faults. I can identify exactly where I am standing, on the outcrop of the Boscastle Formation; in the dry language of science the slates are described as early Carboniferous (what in the US would be called Mississippian). This corner of the world has an extremely ancient origin, older than mammals, older even than dinosaurs. These black slates would already have carried their contorted signature as a guarantee of antiquity when Tyrannosaurus was king of the hill. When they were first laid down there were only tree ferns and cockroaches and cumbrous amphibians on land. Can there be a better place to reflect upon the vastness of geological time? The erosion which I can both see and hear is ineffably slow. I could stand here all my life and notice little difference to the cliffs. Maybe a chasm excavated along a fault might seem subtly darker as its girth increased after an exceptional storm. Perhaps a rock fall would leave a scar cleared of campion and grass. But I am certain that when Thomas Hardy stood on this spot he would have gazed upon a comparable scene; my eyes now see what his once saw. To be sure, the vegetation would have changed, but the geological signature of the cliffs would have been legible in much the same way. How can we conceive of the time needed to wear away these cliffs to nothing, to convert all the massed slates into fine silt, quartz veins into pebbles - at first angular, then worn by the constant shuffling of the sea rounder and rounder, until they acquire the contours and colours of a hen's egg? Millennia are irrelevant, species come and go, and still the cliffs stand obstinate against the inroads of time. Yet given enough time even this rampart that seems to stand so unflinchingly against the surf will be reduced to nothing, and the flagstones on the floor of the Cobweb Inn will return to sediment, joining all the other works of Man, committed once again to the great cycle of change. Rocks are eroded to sediment: sediment is hardened to rock; rock is elevated above sea level by movements of the Earth, transformed by tectonics; and, thus raised, is once more subject to the assault of the elements. This is the great wheel of the Earth. If Gustav Mahler had taken the geological view, Das Lied von der Erde (The Song of the Earth) would have been a cycle of erosion and reconstruction endlessly reiterated, enough to try the patience even of those who admire the most mantric of symphonies. Cornwall once formed part of a vast mountain chain. It marked one end of the Hercynides, which snaked through Europe just as the Alps do today in the south. The patent folding of the rocks was the result of the slates being trapped in a great tectonic vice that showed no mercy. Rocks buckled, in an attempt to accommodate forces that were irresistible. Every tiny ruckle in the wall of Pentargon Bay is the legacy of suffering under a rule of tectonics so mighty that no mere rock could stand against the imperative of crustal stress. When the rocks were folded, structure was piled upon structure until mountains resulted. Clever geologists from the University of Exeter, like E. B. Selwood, have spent years trying to unpick the buckling. They have interpreted this stretch of coast not as merely folded, but as divided into great slices of crust which have slid over and past one another. Squeezed rocks could not absorb the forces by contortion alone, and were compelled to fracture. To attain equilibrium, vast broken slabs of rock larger than a parish slid away from the centre of the forces at a low angle, like the twisted thorn branches leaning away from the reach of the sea wind. Under the sole of these sliding masses weaker rocks were folded over and over, crumpled like a pack of playing cards in the hands of a ruined gambler. Every crack that was opened up, as the country was ground beneath the tectonic wheel, would be filled with vein quartz. Now, the eroded remains of these mountains lay before me. The lichen-covered stone walls were fabricated from the relics of ancient Alps. The farmer who orientated the slaty slabs with such care was conniving with tectonic forces of which he probably knew nothing. Not many miles to the south, near Bodmin, a granite tor rises above the general plain. It is reminiscent of some stepped Mayan pyramid, not least in scale, but is entirely natural. The strange pile of enormous blocks is what remains behind when granite is weathered over many thousands of years. Even granite eventually succumbs to the onslaught of the elements, rain and wind and frost. But granite endures longer than shale, as I was to see in St Juliot's churchyard, not far away. Granite, too, is part of the narrative of the vanished mountain chain, although its source was utterly different from the shales of the Cornish cliffs. It was crystallized from a liquid magma, hot and invasive, within the deep heart of the former chain. Look now: you can see big crystals of felspar, and maybe the sparkle of mica. These crystals tell the story of how a mountain chain drives crumpled rocks so deep into the Earth's crust that they melt, and brew a buoyant, hot broth of liquid minerals, which once more rises through the crust to crystallize and solidify as granite batholiths and plutons. Granite lies at depth beneath the Cornish peninsula, reaching to the surface under the boggy stretches of Dartmoor and Bodmln. At the moment of their formation, some of the crystals set in motion radioactive clocks. Precise modern instruments can now assess the ticking of geological time as it is recorded by decaying radioactive isotopes of uranium or potassium (and several other elements besides) contained in the substance of the crystals. This method provides the answer to that difficult question: how much time has passed? The decay rate is known: it is only a matter of exact measurement and careful calculation to obtain the date of the mineral's formation. If the Bodmin granites were intruded into the folded rocks, then it follows that the granites must postdate the folding. The crystals act almost like eyes that let us see into the past, to calibrate it, to fix it in our vision. So if the crystal age of the granite was 300 million years, it fixes our cliffs as older still - the black slates must have already been folded before the granites were intruded. As to the soft muds which were eventually hardened and distorted into the black slates, they were deposited on a Carboniferous sea-floor, as long as 340 million years ago. Time hardened them, tectonics twisted them, granites punished them with plutonic heat, long before they came to form the cliffs which now make sites for the inaccessible nests of fulmars and kittiwakes. But messages can be passed on from that ancient sea: messages in the shape of fossils. When the sea-floor was young, shells of many kinds of animals lay littered among the muds and sands, just as clam shells can be found stranded on a beach today. These were mostly ordinary, small creatures, snails and brachiopods and the like. Their shells became incorporated into the sediment as more fine mud rained down upon them: mud originated from the erosion of an ancient landmass, which itself was the product of a previous cycle of Earth history. This is how the story of the world turns and turns again. With the passage of time - much more time - the shells were still there as the muds became deeply buried, and then hardened into shales when water was driven out. Perhaps the substance of the shells was augmented by a subtle infiltration of minerals at this time. Their original colours were leached away, a time-change that bleached shells of brightness, converting them to fossil-colour: they became stony simulacra of once-living creatures. Their journey had only just begun. The Carboniferous sea in which animals once flourished and left their shelly tokens was consumed in the engine of plate tectonics. Rocks and fossils alike - the accumulated legacy of the sea - were passengers on a great journey. Many of the fossils were doomed to obliteration. They might be dragged to the centre of the growing Hercyman chain, fated to be squeezed or baked beyond recognition. They might be dissolved away. They might be chopped into pieces as the rocks carrying them recrystallized. Mountains grew over south-west England, great slabs of country were shrugged sideways in the melee. Granites insinuated themselves into the depths. As soon as the mountains were born, they were destined to die by erosion, so, most likely of all, the fossils could be worn away to an impalpable mash that was already on a journey to the next Earth cycle. We must marvel at the fossil survivors, their chutzpah in the face of the orogenic enemy. Sealed in the aftermath of tectonics, the fossils still had to survive all that followed: the rendering of a mountain chain once more into the sea. Through more than 200 million years the Hercyman relic was ground down to its roots. It is certain that the granites reached the surface at a time when dinosaurs were still lumbering over the Weald and western Europe, for curious and distinctive minerals derived from these granites are found for the first time in rocks laid down in Cretaceous times, about 100 million years ago. Like a geological striptease, veils of rock were stripped slowly away to ever more fundamental levels within the ancient chain. Eventually it was stripped naked to its interior, and the show was over. What I was looking at in Pentargon Cliff was one of the inner veils, preserved from obliteration, with its strata still crumpled like discarded chiffon. What fossils might survive in the dark slates? What miracles of endurance might they record, what cheating of the laws of chance? How could a wanderer along this slippery path high above the everlasting sea truly comprehend what is meant by the vastness of geological time, even though the evidence is everywhere displayed? Looking down on Boscastle I could almost capture the historical past - I could 'see' it as one might episodes from half-remembered movies. It is not difficult to paint a mental picture of Hardy on this path. Or to envisage, more than a century ago, filthy slate miners tottering off to the inn of their choice, with the gentry nearby spry in traps; or to conjure up a bustling Tudor port with heavy-rigged ships sheltering from the wildness of the sea in the safe haven, talk of the Armada in the runs, costumes out of Holbein; I can even visualize an Iron Age farmer's tilth and husbandry, and the discomfort of a November day like this in a simple, smoke-filled dwelling. My vision is full of details rooted in shared humanity, set in bric-a-brac drawn from memory plausibly arranged. But to quantify the geological time required for the formation of Cornwall I need to multiply time a thousand-fold, and then perhaps nearly a thousand times again. I am as accustomed to writing figures in millions (of years) as is a Swiss banker (in dollars), yet the lines of zeros do not translate in proportion. Just as the average working man can understand exactly the purchasing power of fifty bucks, and fifty thousand is probably comprehensible, 500,000,000 has an approximate feel to it - surely, it's a fortune, but what does it mean? A lottery wm of 5 million is a lot, but then, so is 22 million. We reel away from such vertiginous figures, we can envisage a huge pile of money, notes piled on notes, but we cannot comprehend its true magnitude. If our intention is to see so far into a past of many millions we shall need to develop a special way of seeing, a spyglass trained on former worlds. We will need to cultivate an indifference to magnitude, so that a million years becomes not, after all, such a long stretch of time. We will need to read rocks and cliffs as if they were books, and not shudder at the heights. I have passed the steep side of Pentargon Cliff. Some kind soul has carved steps to ease the climb, but even so I am out of breath by the time the path levels off. It now follows a course along the middle of a steep, grassy slope, and is very slippery. There is a curious sense of suspension; the sea is far below, but the slope conceals the vast cliffs which I know must be there. I can still hear the sea clearly enough: there is an irregular bang! bang! as waves punish a sea cave along the invisible surf-line, but the great height I have now reached feels almost illusory, as if I were ambling along some unspecified stratum floating between sea and sky. I have reached Beeny Cliff, and I am grateful that the light has not yet started to weaken. A few drops of rain hit me hard in the neck. A flock of gulls suddenly rises up from beyond the cliff edge, buoyed by the updraught and mewling hysterically. The end of my walk makes me turn up my collar, and shiver. Beeny Cliff is the scene of a terrifying episode in Hardy's novel A Pair of Blue Eyes. Stephen Knight follows the same path that I had just completed, in the company of Elfride, the first of Hardy's complex, closely-observed women heroines. Knight is a man of scientific bent. Perhaps seeking to display his knowledge - or maybe just to satisfy his curiosity - he attempts to demonstrate the contrariwise circulation of the air currents up the face of the cliff: 'an inverted cascade ... as perfect as Niagara Falls - but rising instead of falling, and air instead of water' He leaps on to the slope, below the path, and his hat is caught by the countercurrent; in a foolish attempt to retrieve it he slips down the appalling incline. He ends up dangling desperately at the edge of the cliff-face itself; Hardy describes the black slates with some precision. Here it is that Knight comes face to face with the subject of this book. \"By one of those familiar conjunctions of things wherewith the reanimate world baits the mind of man when he pauses in moments of suspense, opposite Knight's eyes was an imbedded fossil, standing forth in low relief from the rock. It was a creature with eyes. The eyes, dead and turned to stone, were even now regarding him, It was one of the early crustaceans called Trilobites. Separated by millions of years in their lives, Knight and this underling seem to have met in their place of death. It was the single instance within reach of anything that had been alive and had had a body to save, as he himself had now.\" In this bleak spot, where I was gazing out towards the precipice between the wrinkled sea below and the darkening sky above, trilobites made a brief appearance in English literature. The path above Beeny Cliff was where two paths of my own life - trilobites and writing - uniquely intersected. I felt compelled to visit the place; and I was not disappointed.

And we are not compelled to wonder whether such an episode was fact or not, because it is woven into the fabric of a novel.

This, after all, may have been what I wanted to discover on a chilly November day in Boscastle. I felt a curious elation, even as the icy raindrops began to refresh the lichens that alone could derive sustenance from incorruptible granite - set solid ever since trilobites had patrolled the shallows of a vanished ocean.

      "body": "<p><strong>Chapter One: Discovery</strong> (cont/d)</p> <p>If you can have love at first sight, then I fell in love with trilobites at the age of fourteen. </p> <p> The peninsula of St Davids forms the south-western promontory of South Wales, extending westwards like a miniature version of the Cornish peninsula where Hardy, too, encountered love. Like Cornwall, it is a region of spectacular and ancient cliffs, while inland the scenery is flat and characterless. There are little coves here, too, with names like Solva and Abercastle, formerly wild and remote fishing villages, but now spruce with whitewash over the rough stone. But the cliffs are as wild as ever they were, and displaying rock folds as convoluted as anything in Cornwall. A walk along the coastal path parades one rock formation after another, delineated by contrasts in colour and texture: here massive yellow or purple sandstones plunge like naked ribs into the churning foam, there a group of contorted dark shales zig-zag up the cliffs like some sort of beserk concertina. In Caerfai Bay there are bright red shales, looking improbably pert in a world of dun geology. All of these rocks are still more ancient than their Cornish counterparts. They date from the Cambrian period, the oldest of the shales having been laid down as muds beneath the sea something like 545 million years before the present. This is getting back to the beginning of things, to a time before there were any plants on land, to a time before any kind of backboned animal existed. Yet there were already trilobites to witness this nascent world. These trilobites were 200 million years older than Thomas Hardy's invented fossil (or, I should say, its real equivalents) - a span a hundred times longer than Man's brief tenancy of this planet. This was the time I explored with a coal hammer at a period of my life when my voice had just turned unreliably falsetto and baritone by turns. While others discovered girls, I discovered trilobites. </p> <p> I had marked the presence of fossils on a local map. They were described as the oldest fossils in the British Isles. What could be more irresistible? There was something extraordinarily exciting about tapping into a vein of such prehistory. The top dressing of the landscape of human tenancy was stripped away to reveal some deeper reality, layer after layer of geological time unpeeled in my imagination. While my long-suffering mother knitted or read, I beat the rocks at Nine Wells and Porth-y-rhaw*. These were places where the rocks were accessible by foot and could be broken by sheer effort. I did not even have a proper geological hammer. The fever of discovery was upon me. I learned how to break the hard rock so that it split in the same direction as the former sea floor - this way I was more likely to retrieve something recognizable. It was clear that tectonic forces had tipped the strata vertically. I had to scrabble to dislodge reasonable-sized blocks for breakage. I ignored the sharp pieces of gorse that speared the backs of my hands. Time had made the rock both hard and brittle: it seemed to want to break anywhere but in the right direction. On the broken surfaces there were scraps and fragments of what might, or might not have been the remains of past life: black patches, a little shinier than the rest of the rock. Then, at last, I found a trilobite. The rock simply parted around the animal, like some sort of revelation. The truth is that the fossil itself had rendered the rock weaker: it was predisposed to reveal itself, almost as if it desired disclosure. I was left holding two pieces of rock: in my left hand the positive impression of the creature itself (known as the part); in my right hand the negative mould which had once comprised its other half (the counterpart); the two together snuggling up to survive the vicissitudes of millions of years of entombment. There was a brownish stain on the fossil, but to me it was no disfigurement - surely what I held was the textbook come alive. Drawings and photographs could not compare with the joy of actually touching a find which seemed, in the egotistical glow of boyhood, dedicated to yourself alone. This was my first discovery of the animals that would change my life. The long thin eyes of the trilobite regarded me and I returned the gaze. More compelling than any pair of blue eyes, there was a shiver of recognition across 500 million years. </p> <p> I would one day learn that the trilobite had a name, Paradoxides. When we first exchanged glances I knew nothing of classification or nomenclature, and it did not matter to me: there was plenty of time to learn more. What I held was a specimen that fitted comfortably into the palm of my hand. It was clearly divided along its length into three lobes - a convex central portion and to each side of it identical, but slightly flattened, areas. These were the lobes implied by the name - trilobite. The whole animal seemed to bulge towards one end. I knew, by some principle which I could not articulate, that the wider end was the head of the animal. And of course upon this head there were the eyes. Despite the unfamiliar conformation of the fossil, I knew that eyes must always belong on heads. So despite the exoticism of the fossil there was already a common bond between me and the trilobite - we both had our heads screwed on the right way. I could see that the body was subdivided into a number of little divisions - or segments, as I would learn to call them. Then there were cracks running across the body. These had nothing to do with the original structure of the animal, rather they were testimony to the long journey through geological time that the Cambrian creature had travelled before it fell apart under my hammer blow. They were joints in the fabric of the rock itself, the scars of an adventure that might have seen the trilobite eroded into oblivion or obliterated in the vice of a thousand tectonic accidents. </p> <p> This book grew out of that first encounter. I want to invest the trilobite with all the glamour of the dinosaur and twice its endurance. I want you to see the world through the eyes of trilobites, to help you to make a journey back through hundreds of millions of years. I will show that Hardy's description of the trilobite as 'but a low type of animal existence' was hardly just, but that his placing the animal at the centre of a drama of life and death might have been nearer the mark. This will be an unabashedly trilobito-centric view of the world. </p> <p> For trilobites have been witnesses to great events. Stephen Knight might have read from the trilobite's stony eyes that the predicament of a mere individual meant nothing. They have seen continents move, mountain chains elevated and eroded to their granite cores, they have survived ice ages and massive volcanic eruptions. No living thing can disengage itself from the biosphere, and trilobites followed the same pattern: their history was also shaped by the events they witnessed. When strangers express their surprise that it is possible to devote a lifetime to studying extinct 'bugs' I remind them of how much has happened in the last few thousand years and invite them to imagine what it is to be a historian of dozens of millions of years. We are doomed to know so little, like fishermen trying to understand an entire ocean by throwing in a few baited handlines. And if anyone wonders how it is possible to invest such devotion in a group of organisms which died out long ago as a result of who-knows-what inadequacies, there is an obvious answer. Trilobites survived for a total of three hundred million years, almost the whole duration of the Palaeozoic era: who are we johnny-come-latelies to label them as either 'primitive' or 'unsuccessful'? Men have so far survived half a per cent as long. </p> <p> There are accounts of scientific research that present the story of discovery as a series of glittering prizes that must be won by the most muscular intellect; this is science as a version of trial-by-combat. Or else scientific research is contained in a metaphor of a journey into uncharted territory, as expressed by Robert Louis Stevenson (in Pulvis et umbra): 'science carries us into realms of speculation, where there is no habitable city for the mind of man.' It is certainly true that there are races to be first in science and that a few massive minds venturing into 'realms of speculation' command the most attention - and they deserve it. Such models of scientific progress are typified by mathematicians and physicists, beautifully elaborated by Karl Popper in Conjectures and Refutations. Nonetheless, as a description of much of scientific endeavour, both the combative and the adventurous-speculative views are flawed. Many scientists - perhaps most of them - are a curious species for whom the pleasure of finding out is at least as important as the size of the goal. He or she is often a co-operative creature, comfortable with the happy exercise of innate ability, and if a momentous discovery comes it may arrive unexpectedly, like an unanticipated legacy. The unique property of the scientific endeavour is that so many of the regular footsoldiers contribute to the victory. Unlike a poetaster whose burblings are destined for true oblivion while the creations of a Keats survive, even a minor scientist might well make a permanent contribution to a famous campaign - an uncelebrated private who did not die in vain. </p> <p> Even the most singular fields of scientific inquiry relate in subtle or unexpected ways to larger questions. We shall see that an apparently self-contained and esoteric occupation like the study of trilobites has contributed to mighty debates about the origin of new species, or the nature of major features of evolution, or the distribution of the ancient continents. Those who started with a deep desire to know more about the details of life habits of vanished anamals - out of sheer curiosity - may suddenly realize that the detailed knowledge they have accrued relates to something different and more general: something as grand as the structure of an ancient ocean or the arrival of an asteroid on Earth. </p> <p> I believe that a more accurate image for the way much of science works might be a series of interconnecting paths. Each one has its own interests and delights; sometimes we know where a path leads, on others we are taken by surprise by twists and turns. And where there are intersections with other paths there can be unanticapated new directions which may lead to wholly unexpected views. Like Stephen and Elfride on the path above The Cliff with No Name there may be a crucial conjunction of circumstances which changes everything, and something as small and ancient as a trilobite may be the catalyst for the transformation. </p> <p> This book will follow a few of the paths that led me from that first schoolboy find. In pursuit of trilobites I shall visit remarkable places and spend time with remarkable people. Knowledge has been hard won, and there are heroes whose names are known only to me and a few of my friends, who deserve wider recognition. There are stories of personal tragedies which have influenced this tale of trilobites. Discovery isn't a simple matter of 'onwards and upwards'. It is imbued with all the tawdry and magnificent stuff of human lives. The story of that small part of science which is important to me will illustrate the way this defining human activity works better than some other accounts of greater endeavours: like relativity or the first few nanoseconds of the universe. Sometimes, a miniature gives a better likeness than a grandiose portrait. </p> <p> Come and see the world as it once was through the crystal eyes of the trilobite. We shall find out how trilobites tell us the pattern of evolution, and how it can be read from the rocks. We shall discover how faith in trilobites not merely moves mountains but shifts whole continents. We shall see how cast-off shells can be re-animated into living animals. We shall understand something of the origins of the richness of the animal kingdom. Through trilobites, we shall take possession of the geological past. </p> <p> * Both these sites are now legally protected from hammering, although they were not at the time of my schoolboy excursions.</p>",

A cut in unemployment to its lowest level for 20 years is a creditable achievement, even if it is unclear how far the government can legitimately claim that this good news story is a central part of the government's own narrative. Yet all this frenetic energy is suffering from a law of diminishing returns. The more the government spins, or presents, or communicates, the more cynicism the process engenders. Some of the brighter cabinet ministers privately believe the solution lies in a period of silence from government. The electorate just need time to see and feel for themselves the impact on the ground of government spending on schools, hospitals and crime. For it is almost a commonplace among ministers that they have erred at the outset by trumpeting their plans too much. Equally, ministers admit ruefully that they did not realise how long it would take to translate their grand ideas into progress on the ground. The snail-like process of a policy idea, green paper, white paper, government legislation, the start of a pilot project and then full implementation sends ministers demented with frustration. It is still the biggest cultural shift they face, and it is still not resolved. In the meantime, the vacuum has to be filled, and that leaves Campbell working as furiously as ever.",

The e-fit is a likeness of a man seen with a young girl fitting Sarah's description at a motorway service station at Knutsford on the M6 in Cheshire on 2 July, a day after she went missing from near her grandparents' home at Kingston Gorse, near Worthing, West Sussex. Police told a news conference that they had received almost 1,500 calls from the public this morning, as the missing girl's mother appealed directly to the man who was spotted at Knutsford with a child fitting her daughter's description. In an appeal on GMTV, Sarah Payne said: \"If this is you or if you know who this is, come forward so we can stop wasting time.\" As the Sun newspaper offered a \u00a350,000 reward for information about Sarah, the girl's favourite pop group, Steps, recorded a message sending Sarah their love and renewing appeals for anyone with information to come forward.

For that reason cover should not be given.\" The MPs' report also criticised the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, who announced in December last year that he was \"minded\" to grant export credit guarantees for the project before the Turkish government had agreed a series of measures intended to minimise environmental impact and address resettlement issues. \"The shotgun wedding approach to export credit that we find in the case of the Ilisu dam does not in our view bode well for the implementation of commitments but is rather the worst form of export credit practice.\" Balfour Beatty asked the DTI's export credit guarantee department (ECGD) to underwrite its \u00a3200m contract. The ECGD provides insurance for British companies' foreign investments: if the foreign country in question defaults on payments the ECGD - in effect the UK taxpayer - foots the bill. The committee also urged wide-ranging reform of the ECGD, which it said should make a clear commitment to respect and protect internationally-agreed human rights in all its activities and consult the Department for International Development on the impact of the projects it provides export credit support for. The committee also called on the ECGD to blacklist companies convicted of bribery or corruption, or those ineligible for World Bank financed contracts because of involvement in such practices. The MPs said that 36 of the 54 companies on the World Bank's blacklist were UK firms.",

The Star Wars hero was riding his Harley Davidson when the animal jumped into the road. Neeson was thrown from the bike just before it ran into a tree. The Oscar-nominated Irish actor suffered a fractured right pelvis, a chipped left pelvis and multiple cuts to his leg. \"We're expecting a quick recovery,\" said Alan Nierob, Neeson's publicist. \u0095 Football hard-man turned Hollywood, er, hard-man Vinnie Jones has been discussing life as a movie star. His big revelation? That, surprise surprise, movie mega-stars are really nice people underneath. His Snatch'd co-star, Brad Pitt, is a down-to-earth kinda guy, says Jones: \"Brad never had a big trailer or anything. We had one trailer and shared. He had one half and I had the other half. We took him to the pub and socialised.\" Of director Guy Ritchie's better half Madonna, Vinnie had this to say: \"She's a wonderful girl. Guy will ring up and we'll go out. You know, my wife, and myself and Madonna and Guy. It's not the same girl as the public see.\" \u0095 Gerard Depardieu has undergone a heart bypass operation at a Paris hospital after suffering chest pains. A doctor at the Foch hospital, where the actor had surgery on Monday, said there were no complications during the six-hour operation. Depardieu's agents added that the 51-year-old Cyrano de Bergerac star is expected to make a full recovery. \u0095 Lego has secured exclusive world rights to produce toys based on Warner Brothers' Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

There will be a funeral service in the cathedral and abbey church of St Alban at 11am on Saturday July 22 and a memorial service will be held at Westminster Abbey on a date to be announced. Lord Runcie often made headlines during his time in office as a strong critic of the Thatcher government. He was outspoken on the miners' strike - saying the government should stop treating its opponents as \"scum\" - the handling of the economy, Britain's \"lunatic\" nuclear arsenal and the Falklands War. Soon after his retirement, the publication of unguarded comments about the Royal Family caused explosions in the Church, and led to accusations that he may have breached his trust as privy councillor. He once expressed satisfaction that he had kept the Church united and that it had \"rocked the boat a bit\" on social issues. The Church Urban Fund, which raised millions of pounds from Church of England dioceses to fund inner city projects for the unemployed and deprived, sprang from a report which Lord Runcie had commissioned - and was immediately labelled \"far left\" and \"Marxist\" by Thatcherite Tory MPs. He was also a man of impressive physical courage.

      "body": "<p>Fijian rebels today freed nine of the 27 hostages they have held in Parliament for nearly two months, but there were ominous signs of spreading unrest outside the capital, Suva.</p> <p>Another rebel group, apparently seeking talks about a land dispute, seized the exclusive Turtle Island beach resort where the movie The Blue Lagoon was filmed, briefly holding 40 tourists.</p> <p>In other incidents, about 70 people, also wanting to discuss land rights, gathered outside Suva's airport while the military reported a riot in the maximum security wing of Naboro prison 10 miles outside Suva.</p> <p>Military spokesman Major Howard Politini said more than 50 prisoners rioted overnight and took six guards hostage. It was not immediately clear if anybody was injured or if the prisoners made any demands.</p> <p>In the first breakthrough in the hostage crisis, nine MPs were released. They were all the ethnic Indian members of parliament held except for deposed prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry and his son. The other remaining hostages are ethnic Fijian legislators.</p> <p>They were freed three days after rebels leader George Speight signed an agreement with the military government. He is supposed to release all his hostages tomorrow.</p> <p>The crisis began 19 May, when Mr Speight's band stormed parliament and took several dozen hostages, including Mr Chaudhry - the nation's first leader from the large ethnic Indian minority.</p> <p>Mr Speight's rebels are ethnic Fijians who say the Indian minority has too much power and they want the multiracial constitution to be scrapped. The military seized control 29 May following violence and looting that erupted after the coup.</p> <p>On Sunday, after weeks of negotiations, military leaders caved in to all Mr Speight's demands and he agreed to free the hostages, but unrest has persisted despite the agreement.

      "bodyText": "Fijian rebels today freed nine of the 27 hostages they have held in Parliament for nearly two months, but there were ominous signs of spreading unrest outside the capital, Suva. Another rebel group, apparently seeking talks about a land dispute, seized the exclusive Turtle Island beach resort where the movie The Blue Lagoon was filmed, briefly holding 40 tourists. In other incidents, about 70 people, also wanting to discuss land rights, gathered outside Suva's airport while the military reported a riot in the maximum security wing of Naboro prison 10 miles outside Suva. Military spokesman Major Howard Politini said more than 50 prisoners rioted overnight and took six guards hostage. It was not immediately clear if anybody was injured or if the prisoners made any demands. In the first breakthrough in the hostage crisis, nine MPs were released. They were all the ethnic Indian members of parliament held except for deposed prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry and his son. The other remaining hostages are ethnic Fijian legislators. They were freed three days after rebels leader George Speight signed an agreement with the military government. He is supposed to release all his hostages tomorrow. The crisis began 19 May, when Mr Speight's band stormed parliament and took several dozen hostages, including Mr Chaudhry - the nation's first leader from the large ethnic Indian minority. Mr Speight's rebels are ethnic Fijians who say the Indian minority has too much power and they want the multiracial constitution to be scrapped. The military seized control 29 May following violence and looting that erupted after the coup. On Sunday, after weeks of negotiations, military leaders caved in to all Mr Speight's demands and he agreed to free the hostages, but unrest has persisted despite the agreement. Speight supporters have occupied police stations and blocked roads across the nation in an apparent effort to wring more concessions from the military, including Mr Speight's possible appointment as prime minister. Fiji's 50-strong great council of chiefs will meet tomorrow to decide on a new prime minister and president under Sunday's accord, which included the dismissal of a civilian administration appointed by the military only last week. Indo-Fijians, whose ancestors were brought to the islands by British colonialists over a century ago to work in the rich sugar cane fields, make up 44% of Fiji's 812,000 people. Many indigenous Fijians, who make up 51%of the population, resent the Indo-Fijians' economic and political clout. Fiji's tourist industry has been devastated by the crisis, with some of the hundreds of resort hotels scattered across dozens of islands reporting occupancy rates as low as 10%. The incident on Turtle Island can only further tarnish Fiji's already battered reputation as a tourist destination.

Lagerfeld has skilfully adapted the label's trademark elegant suits to today's dressed-down world by softening their structure, so that jackets have become as relaxed and comfy as cardigans. The classic Chanel fabric - bobbly boucl\u00e9 wool - was much in evidence, set off by low-slung belts and high-heeled boots in bright metallic gold, lilac and pink.</p> <p>Over-coiffed \u00e0 la Ivana Trump and so over-made-up as to resemble drag queens, the models seemed to be a caricature of the wealthy front-row customers. In contrast, the clothes were highly wearable in almost retro colours - salt-and-pepper tweed, shrimp, camel and cream.</p> <p>For evening, dresses were 20s-style confections: simple shapes hanging poker straight from beaded shoulder straps, with flapperesque layers of beading and tulle to the knee.</p> <p>The metallic accessories featured yesterday are likely to appeal to fashion afficionados, who have been fighting over shoes in similar colours by Prada's Miu Miu label. It was ironic, however, that at a time when the gold-chain handbag, a Chanel classic, is enjoying a mini-revival, there were no handbags on the Chanel catwalk.</p> <p>Instead, Lagerfeld was the latest designer to champion the \"shoulder ruff\". Chanel's ruffs were bright fluffballs of tulle, swung feather boa-like over one shoulder. If the trend for ruffs continues to gather steam, look out for them in Marks &amp; Spencer by autumn.</p>",

The classic Chanel fabric - bobbly boucl\u00e9 wool - was much in evidence, set off by low-slung belts and high-heeled boots in bright metallic gold, lilac and pink. Over-coiffed \u00e0 la Ivana Trump and so over-made-up as to resemble drag queens, the models seemed to be a caricature of the wealthy front-row customers. In contrast, the clothes were highly wearable in almost retro colours - salt-and-pepper tweed, shrimp, camel and cream. For evening, dresses were 20s-style confections: simple shapes hanging poker straight from beaded shoulder straps, with flapperesque layers of beading and tulle to the knee. The metallic accessories featured yesterday are likely to appeal to fashion afficionados, who have been fighting over shoes in similar colours by Prada's Miu Miu label. It was ironic, however, that at a time when the gold-chain handbag, a Chanel classic, is enjoying a mini-revival, there were no handbags on the Chanel catwalk. Instead, Lagerfeld was the latest designer to champion the \"shoulder ruff\". Chanel's ruffs were bright fluffballs of tulle, swung feather boa-like over one shoulder. If the trend for ruffs continues to gather steam, look out for them in Marks &amp; Spencer by autumn.",

      "body": "<p>Both my father and mother were survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto and the Nazi concentration camps. Apart from my parents, every family member on both sides was exterminated by the Nazis. My earliest memory, so to speak, of the Nazi Holocaust is my mother glued in front of the television watching the trial of Adolf Eichmann (1961) when I came home from school. Although they had been liberated from the camps only 16 years before the trial, an unbridgeable abyss always separated, in my mind, the parents I knew from that . Photographs of my mother's family hung on the living-room wall. I could never quite make sense of my connection with them, let alone conceive what happened. </p> <p>Apart from this phantom presence, I do not remember the Nazi Holocaust ever intruding on my childhood. I do not recall a single friend (or parent of a friend) asking a single question about what my mother and father endured. This was not a respectful silence. It was indifference. In this light, one cannot but be sceptical of the outpourings of anguish in later decades, after the Holocaust industry was firmly established. </p> <p>I sometimes think that American Jewry \"discovering\" the Nazi Holocaust was worse than its having been forgotten. True, my parents brooded in private; the suffering they endured was not publicly validated. But wasn't that better than the current crass exploitation of Jewish martyrdom? Before the Nazi Holocaust became the Holocaust, only a few scholarly studies (by Raul Hilberg, Viktor Frankl and Ella Lingens-Reiner) were published on the subject. </p> <p>But this small collection of gems is better than the shelves upon shelves of shlock that now line libraries and bookstores. Both my parents, although daily reliving that past until the day each died, lost interest by the end of their lives in the Holocaust as a public spectacle. One of my father's lifelong friends was a former inmate with him in Auschwitz, a seemingly incorruptible leftwing idealist who on principle refused German compensation after the war. Eventually he became a director of the Israeli Holocaust museum Yad Vashem. Reluctantly and with genuine disappointment, my father finally admitted that even this man had been corrupted by the Holocaust industry, tailoring his beliefs for power and profit. As the rendering of the Holocaust assumed ever more absurd forms, my mother liked to quote (with intentional irony) Henry Ford: \"History is bunk\". The tales of \"Holocaust survivors\" - all concentration camp inmates, all heroes of the resistance - were a special source of wry amusement in my home. </p> <p>My parents often wondered why I would grow so indignant at the falsification and exploitation of the Nazi genocide. The most obvious answer is that it has been used to justify criminal policies of the Israeli state and US support for these policies. There is a personal motive as well. I do care about the memory of my family's persecution. The current campaign of the Holocaust industry to extort money from Europe in the name of \"needy Holocaust victims\" has shrunk the moral stature of their martyrdom to that of a Monte Carlo casino. </p> <p>The Holocaust only emerged in American life after Israel's victory in the 1967 Six Day war against its Arab neighbours. [Since then] too many public and private resources have been invested in memorialising the Nazi genocide. Most of the output is worthless, a tribute not to Jewish suffering but to Jewish aggrandisement. The Holocaust has proven to be an indispensable ideological weapon. Through its deployment, one of the world's most formidable military powers, with a horrendous human rights record, has cast itself as a \"victim\" state, and the most successful ethnic group in the US has likewise acquired victim status. Considerable dividends accrue from this specious victimhood - in particular, immunity to criticism, however justified. </p> <p>The time is long past to open our hearts to the rest of humanity's sufferings. This was the main lesson my mother imparted. I never once heard her say: \"Do not compare.\" My mother always compared. In the face of the sufferings of African-Americans, Vietnamese and Palestinians, my mother's credo always was: \"We are all holocaust victims.\" </p> <p>The term \"Holocaust survivor\" originally designated those who suf fered the unique trauma of the Jewish ghettos, concentration camps and slave labour camps, often in sequence. The figure for these Holocaust survivors at war's end is generally put at some 100,000. The number of living survivors cannot be more than a quarter of this figure now. Because enduring the camps became a crown of martyrdom, many Jews who spent the war elsewhere represented themselves as camp survivors. Another strong motive behind this misrepresentation, however, was material. The postwar German government provided compensation to Jews who had been in ghettos or camps. Many Jews fabricated their pasts to meet this eligibility requirement. \"If everyone who claims to be a survivor actually is one,\" my mother used to exclaim, \"who did Hitler kill?\" </p> <p>Even within the Holocaust industry, Deborah Lipstadt, for example, wryly observes that Holocaust survivors frequently maintain they were personally examined by Josef Mengele at Auschwitz. Because survivors are now revered as secular saints, one doesn't dare question them. Preposterous statements pass without comment. Elie Wiesel reminisces in his acclaimed memoir that, recently liberated from Buchenwald and only 18 years old, \"I read the Critique of Pure Reason - don't laugh! - in Yiddish.\" Leaving aside Wiesel's acknowledgment that at the time \"I was wholly ignorant of Yiddish grammar,\" The Critique of Pure Reason was never translated into Yiddish. \"The truth I present is unvarnished,\" Wiesel sighs, \"I cannot do otherwise.\" </p> <p>In recent years, \"Holocaust survivor\" has been redefined to designate not only those who endured but also those who managed to evade the Nazis. One contributor to a Holocaust website maintained that, although he spent the war in Tel Aviv, he was a Holocaust survivor because his grandmother died in Auschwitz. According to Israel Gutman, a former inmate of Auschwitz, director of Yad Vashem and a Holocaust lecturer at Hebrew University, \"it's not that important\" whether Binjamin Wilkomirski's [now discredited \"autobiographical\" account of childhood in the camps], Fragments, is a fraud. \"Wilkomirski has written a story which he has experienced deeply; that's for sure . . . He is not a fake. He is someone who lives this story very deeply in his soul.\" So it doesn't matter whether he spent the war in a concentration camp or a Swiss chalet; Wilkomirski is a Holocaust survivor because \"his pain is authentic.\" </p> <p>The Israeli prime minister's office recently put the number of \"living Holocaust survivors\" at nearly a million. The main motive behind this inflationary revision is again not hard to find. It is difficult to press massive new claims for reparations if only a handful of Holocaust survivors are still alive. </p> <p>In the early 1950s, Germany entered into negotiations with Jewish institutions and signed indemnification agreements. It has paid out to date some $60bn. The German government also negotiated a financial settlement with the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, an umbrella of major Jewish organisations including the American Jewish Committee, American Jewish Congress, B'nai B'rith, the Joint Distribution Committee. The claims conference was supposed to use the monies, $10m annually for 12 years, or about a billion dollars in current values, for Jewish victims of Nazi persecution who had fallen through the cracks in the compensation process. My mother was a case in point. A survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto, Majdanek concentration camp and slave labour camps at Czestochowa and Skarszysko-Kamiena, she received only $3,500 in compensation from the German government. Other Jewish victims (and many who in fact were not victims), however, received lifetime pensions from Germany, eventually totalling hundreds of thousands of dollars. In a flagrant breach of its letter and spirit, the conference earmarked the monies not for the rehabilitation of Jewish victims who had received minimal compensation but for the rehabilitation of Jewish \"communities\". Indeed, a guiding principle of the claims conference prohibited use of monies for \"direct allocations to individuals\". </p> <p>In a classic instance of looking after one's own, however, the conference provided exemptions for two categories of victims: rabbis and \"outstanding Jewish leaders\" received individual payments. As the conference came under attack from defrauded Jews, Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg cast a plague on both sides, sneering that: \"It's not about justice, it's a fight for money.\" When Germans or Swiss refuse to pay compensation, the heavens cannot contain the righteous indignation of organised American Jewry. But when Jewish elites rob Jewish survivors, no ethical issues arise: it's just about money. </p> <p>Others involved in the reparations process have also done well. The reported annual salary of Saul Kagan, long-time executive secretary of the claims conference, is $105,000. Kagan rings up in 12 days what my mother received for suffering six years of Nazi persecution. </p> <p>In recent years, the Holocaust industry has become an outright extortion racket. Purporting to represent all of world Jewry, living and dead, it is laying claim to Holocaust-era Jewish assets throughout Europe. Fittingly dubbed the \"last chapter of the Holocaust\", this double shakedown of European countries as well as legitimate Jewish claimants first targeted Switzerland. [After a protracted campaign which enlisted the American political establishment] the Swiss finally caved in 1998 and agreed to pay $1.25bn. \"The aim ...\" a Swiss bank's press release read, \"is to avert the threat of sanctions as well as long and costly court proceedings.\" </p> <p>Its solicitude for \"needy Holocaust survivors\" notwithstanding, the World Jewish Congress wants nearly half the Swiss monies earmarked for Jewish organisations and \"Holocaust education\". The Simon Wiesenthal Centre maintains that if \"worthy\" Jewish organisations receive monies, \"a portion should go to Jewish educational centres\". As they \"angle\" for a bigger share of the loot, reform and orthodox organisations each claim that the 6m dead would have preferred their branch of Judaism as financial beneficiary. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Holocaust industry forced Switzerland into a settlement because time was allegedly of the essence: \"Needy Holocaust survivors are dying every day.\" Once the Swiss signed away the money, however, the urgency miraculously passed. More than a year after the settlement was reached there was still no distribution plan. By the time the money is finally divvied out, all the \"needy Holocaust survivors\" will probably be dead. In fact, by last December, less than half of the $200m \"Special Fund for Needy Victims of the Holocaust\" established in February 1997 had been distributed to actual victims. After lawyers' fees have been paid, [total attorney fee demands for the case run to $15m] the Swiss monies will then flow into the coffers of \"worthy\" Jewish organisations. </p> <p>The staggering dimensions of Hitler's Final Solution are by now well known. And isn't the \"normal\" history of humankind replete with horrifying chapters of inhumanity? A crime need not be aberrant to warrant atonement. The challenge today is to restore the Nazi Holocaust as a rational subject of inquiry. Only then can we really learn from it. The abnormality of the Nazi Holocaust springs not from the event itself but from the exploitative industry that has grown up around it. </p> <p>The Holocaust industry has always been bankrupt. What remains is to openly declare it so. The time is long past to put it out of business. The noblest gesture for those who perished is to preserve their memory, learn from their suffering and let them, finally, rest in peace. </p> <p><strong>Finkelstein on ...</strong></p> <p><strong>The Simon Wiesenthal Centre: </strong> \"The Centre is renowned for its 'Dachau-meets-Disneyland' museum exhibits and 'the successful use of sensationalistic scare tactics for fund-raising'.\" </p> <p><strong> Daniel Goldhagen, author of Hitler's Willing Executioners:</strong> \"Although bearing the apparatus of an acade mic study, Hitler's Willing Executioners amounts to little more than a compendium of sadistic violence ... Replete with gross misrepresentations of source material and internal contradictions, Hitler's Willing Executioners is devoid of scholarly value.\" </p> <p><strong> Deborah Lipstadt, the Holocaust scholar who was unsuccessfully sued for libel by David Irving:</strong> \"To document widespread Holocaust denial, Lipstadt cites a handful of crank publications. Her pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance comes from Arthur Butz, a nonentity who teaches electrical engineering.\" </p> <p><strong>David Irving, historian and Holocaust revisionist:</strong> \"Irving, notorious as an admirer of Hitler and sympathiser with German national socialism, has nevertheless made an 'indispensable' contribution to our knowledge of World War II.\" </p> <p><strong> Elie Wiesel, Nobel laureate and Holocaust survivor:</strong> \"Elie Wiesel's performance as official interpreter of the Holocaust is not happenstance. Plainly he did not come to this position on account of his humanitarian commitments or literary talents. Rather, Wiesel plays this leading role because he unerringly articulates the dogmas of, and accordingly sustains the interests underpinning, the Holocaust.\"</p>",

Her pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance comes from Arthur Butz, a nonentity who teaches electrical engineering.\" David Irving, historian and Holocaust revisionist: \"Irving, notorious as an admirer of Hitler and sympathiser with German national socialism, has nevertheless made an 'indispensable' contribution to our knowledge of World War II.\" Elie Wiesel, Nobel laureate and Holocaust survivor: \"Elie Wiesel's performance as official interpreter of the Holocaust is not happenstance. Plainly he did not come to this position on account of his humanitarian commitments or literary talents. Rather, Wiesel plays this leading role because he unerringly articulates the dogmas of, and accordingly sustains the interests underpinning, the Holocaust.\"",

Tall and elegant, urbane and witty, he had the sort of charisma that made everyone he spoke to feel special. People loved him for it.</p> <p>He was a workaholic perfectionist, demanding impossibly high standards of himself and of his staff. Only his most intimate friends knew the true depth of the spiritual faith and toughness which sustained him through punishing schedules of work, public engagements and overseas travel. The vulnerability was there, but the toughness also enabled him to withstand the constant attacks from the tabloid and rightwing press that were mounted on him and his family throughout the middle years of his time at Lambeth Palace.</p> <p>For a short honeymoon period, it had delighted the media that this pig-keeping ex-tank commander archbishop should officiate at a royal wedding, welcome the Pope to Canterbury, and deploy Terry Waite to rescue hostages. But the dramatic change came when he preached penitence and reconciliation at the service of thanksgiving after the Falklands war instead of the triumphalism the press and politicians had looked for. From then on, all his considerable achievements were set against a background of a tabloid venom. His survival was a triumph of intelligence, integrity and courage.</p> <p>Robert Runcie grew up in Crosby, now a suburb of Liverpool, the youngest child of an electrical engineer at the local Tate and Lyle sugar factory. As a pupil he was clever, well-mannered and athletic. His parents were not church-goers. Robert's conversion came about by following a girl on whom he had an adolescent crush to confirmation classes.</p> <p>A scholarship took Runcie to Oxford to read classics, where his time was interrupted by war service. He volunteered to join a Scottish regiment, and was startled to be recruited as officer material for the Scots Guards. It proved a significant part of his education.</p> <p>In later years, Runcie used to say he was probably the first Archbishop of Canterbury since Thomas \u00e0 Becket to have been into battle. The Third Battalion of the Scots Guards landed at Normandy soon after D-Day, and fought their way to the Baltic. En route Runcie won the Military Cross for wiping out a German gun emplacement while under heavy fire.</p> <p>Returning to Oxford, he gained a first class degree in Greats and learned a classical liberalism which shaped his thought for the rest of his life</p> <p>In 1956 he was elected Fellow and Dean of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. There he married Rosalind and the first of their two children was, born.</p> <p>In 1970 he became Bishop of St Albans. While there he became chairman of the central religious advisory committee, answering to both the BBC and the IBA.</p> <p>He seems to have been genuinely astonished when, in 1979, after nine years in St Albans, he became the first archbishop to have been chosen by the church itself under the new Crown Appointments system.</p> <p>In his first three years at Lambeth he was scarcely out of the headlines. The saga of Terry Waite as \"the archbishop's special envoy\" extricating three missionaries being held hostage in Iran captured the public imagination. It took two months of Waite's negotiating skills to gain their release, which Runcie was able to announce at a dramatic moment in the middle of the 1981 February general synod.</p> <p>That same year he married the Prince and Princess of Wales, taking centre stage with them in all the international publicity that surrounded that event.</p> <p>A year later Runcie was instrumental in inviting the Pope John Paul II to Britain and was howled down by anti-papists in his native Liverpool for doing so. On May 29, 1982 the Pope arrived in Canterbury, to be welcomed by Runcie and escorted to the high altar of the cathedral.</p> <p>Victory in the Falklands followed soon after. At the service of thanksgiving in St Paul's Cathedral, Runcie reminded the congregation that war was a terrible thing, and \"people are mourning on both sides in this conflict\". He deeply offended members of the Conservative government who wear expecting triumphalism and much of the rightwing establishment, political and press, never forgave him for it. In the following months, government and media began to realise that on many issues, particularly those to do with unemployment and deprivation, Runcie and a growing number of other bishops, were becoming a political force.</p> <p>Anarchbishops' commission on urban priority areas report in 1985 left Mrs Thatcher in no doubt that the concerned leadership of the Church of England could not endorse Conservative policies which did so little to alleviate the misery of poverty and bad housing in the inner cities. It was often said that with the Labour Party in disarray the Church of England was becoming the real opposition in the country.</p> <p>Runcie retired at the beginning of 1991. He was given a life peerage, and with Lindy went to live in St Albans.</p> <p>\u0095 Rt Rev and Rt Hon Robert Alexander Kennedy Runcie, priest, born October 2, 1921; died July 12, 2000</p>",

The Third Battalion of the Scots Guards landed at Normandy soon after D-Day, and fought their way to the Baltic. En route Runcie won the Military Cross for wiping out a German gun emplacement while under heavy fire. Returning to Oxford, he gained a first class degree in Greats and learned a classical liberalism which shaped his thought for the rest of his life In 1956 he was elected Fellow and Dean of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. There he married Rosalind and the first of their two children was, born. In 1970 he became Bishop of St Albans. While there he became chairman of the central religious advisory committee, answering to both the BBC and the IBA. He seems to have been genuinely astonished when, in 1979, after nine years in St Albans, he became the first archbishop to have been chosen by the church itself under the new Crown Appointments system. In his first three years at Lambeth he was scarcely out of the headlines. The saga of Terry Waite as \"the archbishop's special envoy\" extricating three missionaries being held hostage in Iran captured the public imagination. It took two months of Waite's negotiating skills to gain their release, which Runcie was able to announce at a dramatic moment in the middle of the 1981 February general synod. That same year he married the Prince and Princess of Wales, taking centre stage with them in all the international publicity that surrounded that event. A year later Runcie was instrumental in inviting the Pope John Paul II to Britain and was howled down by anti-papists in his native Liverpool for doing so. On May 29, 1982 the Pope arrived in Canterbury, to be welcomed by Runcie and escorted to the high altar of the cathedral. Victory in the Falklands followed soon after. At the service of thanksgiving in St Paul's Cathedral, Runcie reminded the congregation that war was a terrible thing, and \"people are mourning on both sides in this conflict\". He deeply offended members of the Conservative government who wear expecting triumphalism and much of the rightwing establishment, political and press, never forgave him for it. In the following months, government and media began to realise that on many issues, particularly those to do with unemployment and deprivation, Runcie and a growing number of other bishops, were becoming a political force. Anarchbishops' commission on urban priority areas report in 1985 left Mrs Thatcher in no doubt that the concerned leadership of the Church of England could not endorse Conservative policies which did so little to alleviate the misery of poverty and bad housing in the inner cities. It was often said that with the Labour Party in disarray the Church of England was becoming the real opposition in the country. Runcie retired at the beginning of 1991. He was given a life peerage, and with Lindy went to live in St Albans. \u0095 Rt Rev and Rt Hon Robert Alexander Kennedy Runcie, priest, born October 2, 1921; died July 12, 2000",

Feelings have been running high across the province after Orangemen were banned from marching down the Garvaghy Road, in a mainly nationalist area of Portadown.

The relative risk of becoming a teenage mother from unskilled families compared to professional families almost doubled between the 1958 and 1970 generations.</p> <p>\"Daughters of unskilled men born in 1970 were an astonishing nine times more likely to become a teenage mother than girls whose fathers were more highly qualified,\" she says.</p> <p>Even daughters of skilled manual fathers in both generations were four times more likely to have a teenage child than the the daughter of a professional couple. Other findings highlighted include:</p> <p>\u0095 Men born in 1970 with no qualifications were 12 times more likely to be out of work by the age of 26 than those with degrees. Of those who were in work, their pay was also considerably lower than the children of professional parents.</p> <p>\u0095 Women's chances of being in full time employment - rather than in part-time work or staying home with children - were eight times higher for graduates than for those with no qualifications.</p> <p>\u0095 The impact of class on qualifications was just as great for the 1970 generation as for the 1958. \"The average gap between the daughters of an educated professional father and the daughters of an unskilled man who left school at the minimum age represents about three rungs of a six-rung educational ladder. For sons, the gap in both generations is about two and a half grades.\" The three rungs are equivalent to the difference between a degree and GCSEs.</p> <p>\u0095 In both generations, those with no qualifications were about three times more likely to be classed as depressed at ages 33 and 26 than graduates.</p> <p>\u0095 For both generations, if one or both of a child's parents had left school at the minimum age, the chances of the child doing the same were doubled. In 1970, the sons of an unskilled male were seven times more likely to leave school at the minimum age than those of a professional man.</p> <p>The researchers say at the end of their exhaustive analysis that \"the figures demonstrated convincingly that family social class and parents' educational level at the time our respondents were born were critically important factors in determining what was going to happen to them 16 years later\".</p> <p>The report does, however, find that a child's performance at school, as much as their class background, is starting to become a major predictor of whether someone will leave school at 16.</p> <p>Nevertheless, a child's family background at birth and subsequent poverty are still a clear influence.</p> <p>The researchers also found that boys were less capable of breaking out of their class background than girls.</p> <p>The study examined whether people born in rural Britain fared less well than their urban counterparts, but the research shows there is no discernible independent impact.</p> <p>In her report, Ms Cooper warns that Labour has failed in the past to reduce inequality, and emphasises that the government of which she is a member will ignore the research at its peril.</p>",

In a foreword, Ms Cooper writes: \"The opportunities gap between those from different social backgrounds was no different from those born in 1970 than it was for children born in 1958. \"Although those born in 1970 had better educated parents and so started from a better position, the gap between those from professional and unskilled backgrounds has remained the same.\" In some areas, she claims, \"the detrimental effects of inequality of opportunity are actually growing stronger and more debilitating. The relative risk of becoming a teenage mother from unskilled families compared to professional families almost doubled between the 1958 and 1970 generations. \"Daughters of unskilled men born in 1970 were an astonishing nine times more likely to become a teenage mother than girls whose fathers were more highly qualified,\" she says. Even daughters of skilled manual fathers in both generations were four times more likely to have a teenage child than the the daughter of a professional couple. Other findings highlighted include: \u0095 Men born in 1970 with no qualifications were 12 times more likely to be out of work by the age of 26 than those with degrees. Of those who were in work, their pay was also considerably lower than the children of professional parents. \u0095 Women's chances of being in full time employment - rather than in part-time work or staying home with children - were eight times higher for graduates than for those with no qualifications. \u0095 The impact of class on qualifications was just as great for the 1970 generation as for the 1958. \"The average gap between the daughters of an educated professional father and the daughters of an unskilled man who left school at the minimum age represents about three rungs of a six-rung educational ladder. For sons, the gap in both generations is about two and a half grades.\" The three rungs are equivalent to the difference between a degree and GCSEs. \u0095 In both generations, those with no qualifications were about three times more likely to be classed as depressed at ages 33 and 26 than graduates. \u0095 For both generations, if one or both of a child's parents had left school at the minimum age, the chances of the child doing the same were doubled. In 1970, the sons of an unskilled male were seven times more likely to leave school at the minimum age than those of a professional man. The researchers say at the end of their exhaustive analysis that \"the figures demonstrated convincingly that family social class and parents' educational level at the time our respondents were born were critically important factors in determining what was going to happen to them 16 years later\". The report does, however, find that a child's performance at school, as much as their class background, is starting to become a major predictor of whether someone will leave school at 16. Nevertheless, a child's family background at birth and subsequent poverty are still a clear influence. The researchers also found that boys were less capable of breaking out of their class background than girls. The study examined whether people born in rural Britain fared less well than their urban counterparts, but the research shows there is no discernible independent impact. In her report, Ms Cooper warns that Labour has failed in the past to reduce inequality, and emphasises that the government of which she is a member will ignore the research at its peril.",

      "bodyText": "Corporate activists have forced Vodafone AirTouch, the world's fifth largest company, to prepare an embarrassing \"explanation\" of the \u00a310m bonus it has paid its chief executive, Chris Gent. Lord MacLaurin, chairman of the global telecommunications group, said last night: \"In order to correct some of the misleading comments made in the press recently, we are preparing a statement which will be issued in the near future.\" It is believed the statement will include a pledge that no such bonus will be paid in future. Shareholder protests about the payment to Mr Gent have been led by the Association of British Insurers, whose members hold about a quarter of British shares. They have been pressing Vodafone to issue a declaration that the payment to Mr Gent was a one-off and there would be no repetition of such an arrangement. What particularly angered investing institutions was that the payment was not based on performance but on the value of deals struck by Mr Gent as he has built up Vodafone's worldwide mobile telecoms network. The shareholders argued that the value of these deals in terms of profits for Vodafone would not be quantifiable for years to come. Other investors to have voiced concerns include the National Association of Pension Funds, whose members hold more than \u00a3800bn of assets, and the Pensions and Investment Research Company, which advises local authority pensions funds and has been a fierce critic of boardroom largesse. Although Vodafone is preparing to promise not to make such payments again, it is adamant that the \u00a310m is a fair reflection of Mr Gent's contribution to the company. It is expected to say the bonus is not a precedent for Vodafone or for other companies to follow. The company has told institutions that most of the payment is to bring Mr Gent's remuneration into line with that of other leaders in the competitive telecoms industry. Only a minor element is a re-election of his pivotal role in clinching the takeover of the German telecoms group Mannesmann. The NAPF had been advising its members to abstain at the annual meeting on July 27 from the vote to re-elect Mr Gent to the Vodafone board. The Vodafone statement is expected to result in withdrawal of that threat although individual protests may occur.",

As the two main parties fired the opening shots in a tax-and-spending battle that is likely to dominate the general election campaign, ministers said that the proposals from the Tory leader, William Hague, and the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, would leave a \u00a316bn hole in key public services by 2004. Tony Blair will today outline how the big increases in spending planned for the next three years have only been made possible by the government's hard line in its first two years in office. The prime minister will say that voters will increasingly be able to see the benefits. Labour, after its recent problems, is eager to exploit Mr Hague's decision to water down his much-vaunted \"tax guarantee\", and Mr Blair is keen to publicise good news coming from the labour market, where a million new jobs have been created since the general election and the number of people out of work and claiming benefit is now - at 1,109,000 - only 23,000 higher than when Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979. Though Tory strategists refused to confirm Labour's figures about spending, they admitted that a series of interviews by the Conservative leader and shadow chancellor were designed to give credibility to the opposition's pledge to reduce the burden of taxation in the next parliament by saying that the promise would not apply during an economic downturn. Ministers said last night that the Tories had dug themselves into \"an even deeper hole\" by explicitly stating that they were determined to cut the growth of public spending from the 3.3% a year that Mr Brown has set to around 2%. On their own private admission, shadow ministers say that that would mean cuts of at least \u00a310bn a year, although Hague aides said last night that the health service - currently the voters' chief concern - would be protected. The Conservatives claimed that David Willetts, their social security spokesman, had already found \u00a33bn worth of cuts and that the opposition was convinced that it could net a further \u00a31bn from Labour's extra spending on government itself. However, Andrew Smith, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"Now they have admitted what Labour has always said - that their tax guarantee is a public spending cuts guarantee, a cuts guarantee so extreme that it will hit the health service, education, law and order and transport.\" Unveiled at the Tory conference in October, the original Hague plan \"guaranteed\" voters that a Tory government would cut taxes as a share of national income over the lifetime of a parliament - regardless, critics were quick to say, of whether the economy was in boom or recession. Hague aides now say they were misrepresented and that yesterday's initiative - a Hague interview and Portillo article, both in the Daily Telegraph - was designed to \"refine\" or \"clarify\" the leader's position. Although it is emphatically denied, many MPs on both sides believe that Mr Portillo, who returned to Westminster and rejoined the shadow team soon after the Hague guarantee, is the driving force to give real intellectual weight to Tory economic policy - and to fulfill his own long-standing commitment to cutting public spending as a share of GNP. Mr Portillo remained loyal to Mr Hague yesterday, saying that the Tory leader \"had good reasons for making that pledge. It is what Conservative governments normally achieve - we normally manage to increase the amount of spending on vital public services and reduce the burden of tax.\" But he admitted the plan's weak spot, that in a recession - what he called \"pretty unusual circumstances\" - tax cuts would be impossible if key public services were to be maintained. \"We need to make it clear that of course, although we are committed to the reduction of taxes, we are not going to do that in circumstances where it would be imprudent with the public finances, and we are not going to do that in circumstances where we would have to cut vital national services.\" In his crucial passage he argued that targeted higher spending on key services was compatible with tax cuts and that Labour's own plans showed it would keep on raising taxes without providing voters with better services. \"We are saying that the prudent thing to do with public spending is to allow it to increase.

Although the big increases for health were announced in the Budget earlier this year, it is expected that the chancellor will have enough left over to increase spending on education by just over 5% in real terms and to divide up the remaining \u00a318bn between transport and fighting crime. Overall, spending will increase by 3.3% a year in real terms, faster than the economy's normal growth rate, which averages around 2.25% to 2.5% a year.

      "bodyText": "What BBC governors are there to do has not always been clear, beyond making life hell from time to time for incumbent directors-general. The first, John Reith, fought with Ethel Snowden, wife of the turncoat Labour politician, like dog with cat. Charles Hill was drafted in as chairman by Harold Wilson to bring Hugh Carleton Greene's flamboyant Auntie to heel. In the dismissal of Alasdair Milne and the early retirement of Michael Checkland, the governors were ciphers. Sir Christopher Bland moves seamlessly from certifying the house Birt built to sanctioning its demolition by his successor, Greg Dyke - which makes you wonder whether governors have lately ever checked or balanced. Their selection, based on fancy algorithms to do with gender, race and territory, has not always thrown up first-rate advocates of programmes that are original, necessary, different and public-spirited. Now the culture secretary Chris Smith is about to redraft the regulatory apparatus for what is still, quaintly, called broadcasting. When material can be transmitted from a host of \"platforms\", including new-generation mobile phones, the overlapping remits of the radio and television and broadcasting standards commissions and the Office of Telecommunications certainly need reworking. But Mr Smith as he plots reform should bear two points in mind. The governors may seem anomalous in the wider scheme of early 21st-century transmissions technology but are no more peculiar than the BBC itself. They are the public's trustees, ultimate carriers of the \"gene\" of Reithian public service. Appointments are in Mr Smith's gift. The board is as good or bad today as his predecessors made it. If he wants a better performance, he must choose its members more diligently than they did. Only then can the board sustain on behalf of autonomous licence-funded broadcasting that wonderful, anachronistic ideal for which the BBC still stands.",

His state of the nation address last weekend, coupled with recently promulgated foreign policy, national security, and military \"doctrines\", have finally shed some light on how he intends to run Russia. Our pre-election question, \"who is Vladimir Putin?\" may now be confidently answered. It transpires he is two quite different people wrapped into one.</p> <p>To the world at large, Mr Putin presents a plausible if unlovable face. Sidestepping the vexed question of Nato enlargement, and burying the Kosovo hatchet, his administration now says it wants a constructive relationship with the US and the west. On arms control, Mr Putin has deftly gained a moral advantage, pushing through Duma ratification of the Start II accord while leading the charge against America's treaty-busting national missile defence plans. Far from alienating the west, these and similar initiatives have impressed European governments, who have their own concerns about NMD and proliferation.</p> <p>Mr Putin's desire to create a \"multi-polar\" world free of American hegemony has appeal in capitals as far apart as Paris and Beijing. The Russian leader will use a coming visit to China (and North Korea) to explore other areas of cooperation.

      "bodyText": "Four months after his landslide poll victory, President Vladimir Putin of Russia has belatedly produced an election manifesto. His state of the nation address last weekend, coupled with recently promulgated foreign policy, national security, and military \"doctrines\", have finally shed some light on how he intends to run Russia. Our pre-election question, \"who is Vladimir Putin?\" may now be confidently answered. It transpires he is two quite different people wrapped into one. To the world at large, Mr Putin presents a plausible if unlovable face. Sidestepping the vexed question of Nato enlargement, and burying the Kosovo hatchet, his administration now says it wants a constructive relationship with the US and the west. On arms control, Mr Putin has deftly gained a moral advantage, pushing through Duma ratification of the Start II accord while leading the charge against America's treaty-busting national missile defence plans. Far from alienating the west, these and similar initiatives have impressed European governments, who have their own concerns about NMD and proliferation. Mr Putin's desire to create a \"multi-polar\" world free of American hegemony has appeal in capitals as far apart as Paris and Beijing. The Russian leader will use a coming visit to China (and North Korea) to explore other areas of cooperation. One is a shared abhorrence of anything that smacks of interference in their internal affairs. For Russia, this means Chechnya; for China, Taiwan and Tibet. They also agree on the need to uphold the primacy of the UN in international affairs and, for example, the necessity of lifting sanctions on Serbia and Iraq. But such convictions will not prevent the pragmatic Mr Putin attending the G8 club's summit in Okinawa on July 21, where he will hope to exploit his recent acquaintance with Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. Mr Putin's canny message to the outside world is that his post-Yeltsin Russia will be a stable, business-friendly democracy, committed to open markets, lower taxes and state sector reform; a Russia with which the west would do well to engage through trade, aid, investment and common-sense realpolitik. It is in fact the message he knows the west badly wants to hear. How else to explain its silence over still unchecked atrocities in Chechnya, and the EU's sickening, cynical decision this week to resume $90m of suspended Russian aid?

The men and women who knew were last night refusing to say.</p> <p>But the result was that a tiny printing error had nullified millions of \u20ac100 notes now in production in Euroland's biggest economy, Germany.</p> <p>The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported that the mistake would cost at least 65m marks (\u00a320m) and could mean the loss of six months' production. It said 325m new bills were affected by what the European Central Bank called a \"slight visual deviation\".</p> <p>A spokesman at the ECB in Frankfurt refused yesterday to confirm or deny the figures on security grounds.

But the result was that a tiny printing error had nullified millions of \u20ac100 notes now in production in Euroland's biggest economy, Germany. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported that the mistake would cost at least 65m marks (\u00a320m) and could mean the loss of six months' production. It said 325m new bills were affected by what the European Central Bank called a \"slight visual deviation\". A spokesman at the ECB in Frankfurt refused yesterday to confirm or deny the figures on security grounds. But, he added, \"I could laugh if it weren't so tragic\".

The deal is described in BA's report as \"a special non-pensionable payment of remuneration and damages for breach of contract\". </p> <p>Lord Marshall admitted that Mr Ayling had been legally entitled to a bigger settlement but it was not pressed. The deal includes unlimited free travel for Mr Ayling and his family. </p> <p>Company sources said later that the deal with Mr Ayling was legally watertight and that there was nothing BA could do to unstitch it. </p> <p>At one stage during the meeting, Lord Marshall dodged a question from one shareholder suggesting that the responsibility for BA's disastrous recent performance lay with Lord Marshall and other board members as well as Mr Ayling. </p> <p>After the meeting he conceded the point, but walked away as he was asked if he thought he should resign as well. In spite of BA's appalling results, he had been able to promise shareholders that they would receive a dividend of 17.9p a share, the same as last year. </p> <p>Lord Marshall had been forced to rewrite his speech in response to a threat from Standard Life, a shareholder with 2.3% of the airline, that it would vote against the Ayling package. He agreed to say that BA had blundered, in return for which Standard Life abstained. </p> <p>He told shareholders: \"The final payout to Mr Ayling is a large one. I accept that. Employee morale deteriorated. However, my board is mindful of and is sensitive to the views expressed by shareholders. </p> <p>\"It has decided to review carefully the process it followed in reaching its settlement with Mr Ayling to see what lessons can be learned for the future, and to satisfy itself that there is nothing further can be done in respect of that settlement.\" </p> <p>He said pension contracts were less generous at BA than when Mr Ayling's contract was agreed and the issue would not come up again. </p> <p>In his first speech since his appointment, BA's new chief executive, Rod Eddington, warned of the threat to the airline of fast trains in Europe, particularly to Paris and Brussels. He also highlighted the threat from low-cost airlines, saying that BA must adjust its short-haul business. </p> <p>He avoided mentioning job cuts, although these are inevitable, particularly if the proposed merger with the Dutch airline KLM goes ahead.</p>",

That contract allowed Mr Ayling to obtain an immediate pay-off of almost \u00a32m plus a pension of \u00a3260,000 starting from last May and payable for the rest of his life. The deal is described in BA's report as \"a special non-pensionable payment of remuneration and damages for breach of contract\". Lord Marshall admitted that Mr Ayling had been legally entitled to a bigger settlement but it was not pressed. The deal includes unlimited free travel for Mr Ayling and his family. Company sources said later that the deal with Mr Ayling was legally watertight and that there was nothing BA could do to unstitch it. At one stage during the meeting, Lord Marshall dodged a question from one shareholder suggesting that the responsibility for BA's disastrous recent performance lay with Lord Marshall and other board members as well as Mr Ayling. After the meeting he conceded the point, but walked away as he was asked if he thought he should resign as well. In spite of BA's appalling results, he had been able to promise shareholders that they would receive a dividend of 17.9p a share, the same as last year. Lord Marshall had been forced to rewrite his speech in response to a threat from Standard Life, a shareholder with 2.3% of the airline, that it would vote against the Ayling package. He agreed to say that BA had blundered, in return for which Standard Life abstained. He told shareholders: \"The final payout to Mr Ayling is a large one. I accept that. Employee morale deteriorated. However, my board is mindful of and is sensitive to the views expressed by shareholders. \"It has decided to review carefully the process it followed in reaching its settlement with Mr Ayling to see what lessons can be learned for the future, and to satisfy itself that there is nothing further can be done in respect of that settlement.\" He said pension contracts were less generous at BA than when Mr Ayling's contract was agreed and the issue would not come up again. In his first speech since his appointment, BA's new chief executive, Rod Eddington, warned of the threat to the airline of fast trains in Europe, particularly to Paris and Brussels. He also highlighted the threat from low-cost airlines, saying that BA must adjust its short-haul business. He avoided mentioning job cuts, although these are inevitable, particularly if the proposed merger with the Dutch airline KLM goes ahead.",

Before departing for the summit, both leaders set out their positions - or \"red lines\" in Israeli parlance - with unusual clarity.

The date marks seven years to the day since President Clinton tugged his arm towards that historic handshake with the assassinated Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, on the White House lawn. If Mr Arafat declares a state unilaterally, Israel says it would annex large chunks of territory. So far, Mr Arafat's Palestinian Authority has full sove reignty in 40% of the West Bank - but with Israel controlling all main roads, his domain is a string of islands. The fear is that the new state will be born in blood if the talks fail and Mr Arafat makes a unilateral declaration. Israeli security officials been issuing dire warnings about huge stockpiles of arms in Palestinian areas. The Israeli prime minister's vision of the future is of a complete separation between Arab and Jew, with the two peoples fenced into their respective enclaves. He calls this security.

Mr Arafat is insisting that Israel return all lands occupied since the 1967 war. Even so, this is a considerable compromise: Gaza and the West Bank make up only 22% of mandate Palestine; he gave up claims to Israel proper when the peace process began.

Israel flat out refuses to recognise the Palestinian right of return endorsed by UN resolutions, or to accept moral and legal responsibility for their suffering. The Palestinians say Israel must accept responsibility for the expulsions and allow the refugees to go home.

Countless summits and conferences later, the fundamental, most visceral issues remain unresolved - the fate of 3m Palestinian refugees, the shape of a Palestinian state, and most intractable of all, sovereignty over Jerusalem. There were few obvious reasons yesterday to believe that the divide could be closed in the coming week of final-settlement talks in Maryland -before President Clinton is due to fly to an economic summit in Japan - other than the clear possibility that failure could mean a resurgence of violence in the West Bank and Gaza. Mr Barak arrived 12 hours late, having scraped through a vote of no-confidence in the Israeli knesset. A suspicious Mr Arafat only came after considerable US state department arm-twisting. As he set off for the talks from the White House, President Clinton portrayed the summit as a pivotal moment, and said the \"weight of history\" hung heavily on the shoulders of both leaders. \"We have an opportunity to bring about a just and enduring end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The hardest issue will be Jerusalem, which both sides view as the spiritual core of their identity; there was no compromise in sight between Palestinian demands for a share of the city and its holy sites and the Israeli insistence that it remain the \"eternal and undivided\" capital of the Jewish state. An Israeli official accompanying the delegation said that the attempt to unseat Mr Barak on the eve of his departure demonstrated his narrow room for manoeuvre, especially regarding Jerusalem.

A reporter for the Lagos newspaper the Daily Times, Sola Adebayo, said he counted 100 charred bodies, many of them young children wearing school uniforms. The blast occurred early on Monday morning outside the villages of Adeje and Oviri-Court, about 12 miles north of the port city of Warri in the oil-rich Niger delta. The fire continued to rage yesterday and clouds of black smoke hung over the area, as state petroleum company workers and firefighters tried to bring the blaze under control. Dan Akpele, a farmer near the village at Oviri-Court, said he heard a loud explosion and saw swarms of people running and screaming. \"There was total confusion. We were all shocked and confused,\" Mr Akpele said. \"I just thank God all 13 of my children are safe.\" Although no cause for the blaze has been given, witnesses said the pipeline had been punctured on Sunday night by local people who stole the petrol in buckets to sell by the roadside. Explosions of this type on Nigeria's pipelines have become so common that fire crews did not arrive at the scene until 24 hours after the blast; normal practice is to shut down the supply of pe troleum to allow the fire to burn itself out. \"When we heard the explosion and saw the raging fire we considered it as normal because the breaking of pipelines and siphoning of fuel is happening all the time,\" said Monday Ochuko, who lives in Adeje. \"But when people started screaming we rushed there and saw the bodies,\" said Mr Ochuko, who added that he had taken his family to Warri for fear of a police swoop on suspected fuel thieves. Industry officials say petrol theft has become such a booming business in southern Nigeria that some people now use road tankers. \"The tanker drivers puncture the pipeline and pump gasoline into their vehicles and then drive off, leaving fuel gushing out. Villagers then come in with their buckets and jerry cans,\" one official said. The incident occurred close to the town of Jesse, where as many as 1,000 people died in a similar disaster in late 1998. Some cases of sabotage are also carried out by militant activists trying to force the government and oil companies to give compensation to communities for land use and industrial pollution. Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest oil exporter. Sales of crude oil account for more than 80% of the government's revenue, and disruptions caused by sabotage are especially painful at a time when oil prices have risen dramatically from the lows of 1998.",

      "body": "<p>A planned biography of Rupert Murdoch last night appeared to be the first victim of the takeover by his HarperCollins publishing company of its small but highly regarded rival, Fourth Estate.</p> <p>The unauthorised book by Michael Crick on the Australian born media owner promised to shed light on the apparently unstoppable rise of Mr Murdoch - but will now not be published by the British company.</p> <p>Mr Crick, best known for unearthing John Major's first love and tracing the long lost relatives of Lord Archer, received a six figure advance last year for the Murdoch book.</p> <p>Mr Crick was unavailable for comment last night. But his wife - and his sometime researcher - said: \"Both sides [Fourth Estate and Mr Crick] have agreed he cannot do the book and his agent is trying to reach some kind of settlement.\"</p> <p>The takeover has sent shivers through Fourth Estate staff who remember the furore at HarperCollins over a planned book about Hong Kong by former governor Chris Patten. The book was dropped amid allegations that Mr Murdoch had personally forced HarperCollins to do so because it was critical of China, where the media baron was keen to do business. Victoria Barnsley, the founder of the London based independent Fourth Estate, yesterday sold the company for an estimated \u00a312m to the US based group. She has been appointed chief executive of HarperCollins UK.</p> <p>She dismissed the political implications of Mr Murdoch being the new owner and insisted no definite decision had been made on whether or not to go ahead with Mr Crick's book.</p> <p>\"I have spoken to Michael and I will be speaking to his agent again,\" she said. \"It is difficult for him and we recognise there is a general conflict of interest.\"</p> <p>The 36 staff at Fourth Estate are expected to move to HarperCollins' London base in Hammersmith. No significant redundancies are expected although Ms Barnsley refused to rule out job losses.</p> <p>Fourth Estate was launched in 1984 and quickly built up an impressive reputation, bringing award winning authors such as Annie Proulx and Dava Sobel to a wider UK audience.</p> <p>HarperCollins would not say how much it had paid for Fourth Estate, whose biggest shareholder was the Guardian Media Group, publisher of the Guardian newspaper. But well placed sources confirmed the \u00a312m figure and said Ms Barnsley held around a quarter of the shares.</p> <p>The Fourth Estate founder said she was not motivated by personal financial gain. The decision to sell was taken unanimously by the executive directors.</p> <p>HarperCollins was the most attractive of a number of offers. It was important that HarperCollins offered a big step into the US market, where Fourth Estate has no presence.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A planned biography of Rupert Murdoch last night appeared to be the first victim of the takeover by his HarperCollins publishing company of its small but highly regarded rival, Fourth Estate. The unauthorised book by Michael Crick on the Australian born media owner promised to shed light on the apparently unstoppable rise of Mr Murdoch - but will now not be published by the British company. Mr Crick, best known for unearthing John Major's first love and tracing the long lost relatives of Lord Archer, received a six figure advance last year for the Murdoch book. Mr Crick was unavailable for comment last night. But his wife - and his sometime researcher - said: \"Both sides [Fourth Estate and Mr Crick] have agreed he cannot do the book and his agent is trying to reach some kind of settlement.\" The takeover has sent shivers through Fourth Estate staff who remember the furore at HarperCollins over a planned book about Hong Kong by former governor Chris Patten. The book was dropped amid allegations that Mr Murdoch had personally forced HarperCollins to do so because it was critical of China, where the media baron was keen to do business. Victoria Barnsley, the founder of the London based independent Fourth Estate, yesterday sold the company for an estimated \u00a312m to the US based group. She has been appointed chief executive of HarperCollins UK. She dismissed the political implications of Mr Murdoch being the new owner and insisted no definite decision had been made on whether or not to go ahead with Mr Crick's book. \"I have spoken to Michael and I will be speaking to his agent again,\" she said. \"It is difficult for him and we recognise there is a general conflict of interest.\" The 36 staff at Fourth Estate are expected to move to HarperCollins' London base in Hammersmith. No significant redundancies are expected although Ms Barnsley refused to rule out job losses. Fourth Estate was launched in 1984 and quickly built up an impressive reputation, bringing award winning authors such as Annie Proulx and Dava Sobel to a wider UK audience. HarperCollins would not say how much it had paid for Fourth Estate, whose biggest shareholder was the Guardian Media Group, publisher of the Guardian newspaper. But well placed sources confirmed the \u00a312m figure and said Ms Barnsley held around a quarter of the shares. The Fourth Estate founder said she was not motivated by personal financial gain. The decision to sell was taken unanimously by the executive directors. HarperCollins was the most attractive of a number of offers. It was important that HarperCollins offered a big step into the US market, where Fourth Estate has no presence.",

Union leaders claimed the government was using a \"sledgehammer\" approach to blame ordinary workers for the funding problems in the public sector after the chief secretary to the Treasury, Andrew Smith, published a report claiming workers in some public sector jobs are abusing the system and viewing sickness pensions almost as a right. The report called on government departments to set out five year action plans by this October to cut back the \"unacceptably high\" numbers of early retirements due to ill-health in the public sector which cost the taxpayer \u00a31bn a year in pensions. Dave Prentis, the general secretary-elect of Unison, accused the government of \"whipping up hysteria\" over the report, which was a \"slur\" against his members. A Treasury review found that although the numbers taking ill health retirement have fallen since a mid-1990s peak of 40,000 a year, the present figure of 22,000 a year was still one third higher than that in the private sector. The report also revealed that rates of early ill health retirement vary widely within the public sector, with 68% of firefighters taking early retirement compared with 49% of police officers and 25% of teachers.

The report, which also called for more \"rigorous\" medical assessments to be carried out by two doctors, was greeted with anger by many public sector unions. Dave Prentis, of Unison, said: \"If there is abuse in the system, it should be dealt with.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of Bosnian Muslims returned to Srebrenica yesterday, defying jeers and rock-throwing to mourn relatives who lie decaying in surrounding fields, slaughtered exactly five years ago in the worst massacre of post-1945 Europe. They offered prayers of peace but not forgiveness. Watching and whistling from surrounding hills were Serbs who have taken over the Muslims' houses. A convoy of 64 buses ferried 3,000 mourners, mostly women, for a 20-minute ceremony at the former UN compound where males more than 13 years old were separated and taken away to be executed in a four-day slaughter in July 1995. Loudspeakers relayed the Dzennaze Namaz , a prayer for the dead, led by a dozen blue-robed imams, and Bosnia's senior mufti asked for justice. Faint voices from the hills reached the crowd: \"Turks go fuck yourselves.\" Serbs making three-fingered victory signs had greeted the buses as they approached the town. Thousands of US, Portuguese and French troops from Bosnia's stabilisation force, backed up with armoured vehicles, made a show of force to protect the convoy. Rocks were thrown but no injuries were reported after the buses entered Republika Srpska, the para-state granted to Serbs within Bosnia under the Dayton peace accord. International aid agencies and diplomats were divided over whether to attend the ceremony. Privately, many complained that it damaged reconciliation efforts by raising tension. Embassies queasy about participating felt obliged to do so after Thomas Miller, the US ambassador, vowed to go. \"The least the international community could do was come here and show its face, to try to show some understanding,\" he said. Srebrenica was overrun towards the end of Bosnia's 1992-95 civil war by Serb forces who killed more than 7,000 after brushing aside 100 Dutch soldiers supposed to make it a UN \"safe area\".

      "bodyText": "As an English teacher of 25 years experience I was horrified by the cynicism of your unnamed cheating teacher's \"justification\" for her actions (The big cheat, July 11). The example she is setting the children in her charge - that if you don't like the system it is permissible to cheat - will have a far greater effect on their minds than any flaws in the National Curriculum. Has it not occurred to her that the time she spends on writing 18 spurious essays could be better used helping those students to develop their own responses to the complexities of Shakespeare? Anthony Purcell Chelmsford \u0095 The cheating techniques Nick Davies describes were first exploited in the 11-plus. Many years ago I was sent to another school to supervise the exam alongside the class teacher. He wandered among the desks frowning and shaking his head when an answer was incorrect. At the end he told me about the dummy runs which the pupils had had for the previous weeks. These practices and the early opening of the envelopes and checking of papers have been taken up in Sats testing because of the profound effect good results have on a school's reputation. Bob Tutton Retired primary headteacher Reading \u0095 Before he continues his increasingly hysterical assault on state education, Nick Davies should spend more time day to day with working teachers. Why write our pupils' Macbeth essays when they carry only 5% of the total English mark? Any teacher who does so must have a lot of excess energy. Stress how much poverty and home background matter by all means, Mr Davies, but spare us your rewrite of Apocalypse Now. Graham Foster Head of English Midhurst Grammar School \u0095 I am a private tutor working for a reputable agency and, among other things, I \"help\" GCSE \"failing\" students whose parents pay me to correct/rewrite their children's course work. As far as I am aware there is nothing illegal about it. Even the BBC and Guardian have websites with admirably accurate information and likely questions covering all English syllabuses. The real issue is that for students not on the internet at home, or with poor parents, none of this help is available. Unless payment by results, league tables and the like are abolished, these practices will become even more widespread, and will accentuate further the divide in education between the rich and poor.

      "bodyText": "The Law Society sat idly by for most of a decade while the solicitors' complaints system \"lurched from one self-destructive strategy to another\", the legal service ombudsman, Ann Abraham, said in a damning report yesterday. The result has been a \"crisis in the organisation and governance of the legal profession\" and a system which has failed to get to grips with a huge increase in complaints against solicitors, according to her 1999-2000 report. The Office for Supervision of Solicitors, the arm of the Law Society which handles complaints, \"habitually takes far too long to do too little\", said Ms Abraham. \"It is not just that case after case demonstrates unacceptable delay, still often of well over a year. In addition, the end result of that protracted investigation is frustration that the crucial issues have so often been ignored, overlooked or misconstrued.\" Backlogs at the office, which is overseen by the ombudsman, grew to such a level that the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, took powers in the Administration of Justice Act 1999 to remove self-regulation from the profession. He warned the society that he would hand the role over to a new independent complaints commissioner if targets to reduce the backlog and process new cases were not met. By last month, the office had reduced its July 1999 backlog of 17,074 cases to 11,284 against a target of 6,000 outstanding cases by the end of December. But it is falling substantially short of the turnaround target which stipulates that 90% of new cases should be dealt with in three months. In May only 31% of cases were completed in that time. Numbers of complaints last year reached one for every five of the 80,000 solicitors in practice. Complainants dissatisfied with the way the office has handled their complaints can ask for a review by the ombudsman. Instead of improving, standards are slipping, with only 59% of complaints dealt with to their satisfaction, compared with 70% in 1996. \"There are far too many cases where the quality of the OSS's decision making is simply not acceptable,\" said Ms Abraham. Last month David Lock, minister in the Lord Chancellor's Department, said the government had \"grave concern\" over the office's ability to deal with cases fast enough and to a high enough standard. Ms Abraham accused solicitors of professional arrogance and failing to adopt a consumer culture, reacting defensively to complaints as an attack on their professional integrity. She quoted the former Law Society president, Martin Mears, who described clients who complained as \"whingers and grievance mongers whose primary object in making a complaint is to avoid paying a bill\". Ms Abraham said: \"We come across very few people who could ever be labelled 'professional complainers'. What we do see are many, many people who have been poorly served by lawyers in what is often their first and only encounter with the legal system and who have come away disappointed and disillusioned by the experience - and with their respect for the legal profession sadly diminished.\" The Law Society has ploughed an extra \u00a311m into the complaints system in an effort to keep the right to regulate solicitors. Michael Napier, who was elected president this week, said: \"I am determined that we will continue to do whatever it takes to achieve the right level of quality and turnaround in dealing with clients' complaints.\" He pledged to try to bring about a \"more customer-focused attitude\" in the profession.",

Claire Penny, of Alvaston, Derby, gets around in a motorised wheelchair and can communicate by computer, the court heard. The South Derbyshire health authority admitted liability. Duke battles for mining rights The crown estate and the Duke of Westminster are locked in legal action over ancient land rights, it emerged yesterday.

Racing pigeons mutilated Fifty racing pigeons died after their feet were cut off for their identity rings, police said yesterday.

A full appeal in the autumn will decide whether the convictions of Wyner and Brock were fair.</p> <p>Wyner, a director of the Wintercomfort charity in Cambridge, and Brock, a charity manager, were convicted in December of knowingly permitting the supply of heroin.</p> <p>The pair, both 50 and with years of experience working with the homeless, were arrested after police mounted a surveillance operation at the shelter.

      "bodyText": "Two charity workers jailed in a landmark case for knowingly permitting drug dealing at a hostel for the homeless were yesterday freed on bail pending an appeal. The release of Ruth Wyner and John Brock by the appeal court in London brought relief to social workers and volunteers in the homeless field who have campaigned against the pair's conviction and sentence. There has been concern that the jailing of Wyner and Brock, for five and four years respectively, after police discovered heroin was being peddled at the hostel they managed, set a dangerous precendent. Some centres have turned addicts away rather than risk similar accusations, while others have seen a drop in volunteers. A campaign backed by Julie Christie, Tom Stoppard and Michael Winner has called for an overhaul of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, which led to the jailing of the pair. A full appeal in the autumn will decide whether the convictions of Wyner and Brock were fair. Wyner, a director of the Wintercomfort charity in Cambridge, and Brock, a charity manager, were convicted in December of knowingly permitting the supply of heroin. The pair, both 50 and with years of experience working with the homeless, were arrested after police mounted a surveillance operation at the shelter. A spy camera captured dealing in the shelter's courtyard while two police officers posing as homeless men visited the centre 12 times and bought heroin on eight occasions. During the trial at King's Lynn crown court, the prosecution claimed the centre was \"almost a supermarket for heroin\". Wyner and Brock insisted that they were shocked at the extent of the dealing and it was accepted that they were never present when dealing was taking place. At the heart of the case was the charity's policy of confidentiality which effectively prevented them from handing over the names of those suspected of being involved in drugs to the police. Such a policy is common in the homeless sector. And as there is a high level of drug addiction among the homeless - up to 70% say some estimates - many experts believe that some dealing is almost inevitable in many hostels. Yesterday Michael Mansfield QC, counsel for the pair, argued that at the trial, Judge Jonathan Haworth did not give the jury enough leeway to decide if Wyner and Brock had taken all reasonable steps to prevent drug dealing. He said Wyner and Brock had felt bound by the policy of confidentiality \"and felt they should not save in extreme circumstances hand over information to other agencies including the police\". Wintercomfort was not an \"isolated maverick\" organisation, but a respected charity set up to confront an urgent social problem, said Mr Mansfield. He added: \"Unfortunately in this day and age there are a larger number of people than ever before who have no other home than the street. \"Wintercomfort filled a gap where others fear to tread, hoping to restore dignity to individuals so they could re-enter the mainstream of life and make a contribution.\" Mr Mansfield said that the centre, funded by the local health authority and local councils and overseen by a board of trustees, provided shelter and food to around 100 homeless people a day. He pointed out that the police were closely involved in the project. A senior officer attended advisory meetings and a local beat officer frequently visited. During the trial he had said that he felt Wyner and Brock were doing \"as good a job as could be expected\". Mr Mansfield said the case was of considerable importance for many others who worked with the homeless. He said that Wintercomfort now had a different system, operating a \"closed door\" policy in which all visitors' names were taken, and opening for shorter hours. A public gallery packed with supporters of the \"Cambridge Two\" erupted in loud and sustained cheering and applause as Lord Justice Rose announced the appeal court's decision to grant bail. Wyner turned to Brock and planted a kiss on his forehead. There were more scenes of delight outside the court as the pair were released. Hugging in turn her husband, Gordon, 52, daughter Rachel, 16, and son Joel, 23, Wyner said: \"I am absolutely delighted. I'm looking forward to spending some precious time with my children and private time with my husband. I'm also looking forward to a good cup of coffee. The past seven months have been very tough indeed.\" Brock, who was greeted by his wife Louise, 39, and sons Lloyd, 16, and Dillon, 11, said: \"I'm overjoyed to be with my family again. I'm looking forward to being with them. It's a cause for cautious celebration.\" Peter Bottomley, Tory MP for Worthing West, who has backed the pair's campaign, said: \"There is an expectation that the convictions will in the end be overturned and there is also a view that the grossly excessive sentence will receive adverse comment in the court of appeal.\" He said social workers across the country had been horrified by the case.",

The tour has come under scrutiny because it features a video that portrays violence and graphic sexual situations. One scene on the controversial video shows the rapper Snoop Doggy Dog robbing a liquor store and asking the audience, \"Shall I shoot?\". Dr Dre has been accused by local police of promoting pornography through the video which was dropped by the show for one night after local officials threatened to cut power to the hall. Eminem was also prevented from bringing a naked inflatable doll on stage. The show's promoters are arguing that by-laws stopping them from showing the video are a breach of their first amendment rights to free speech. Eminem, who wrote such songs as I Just Don't Give a Fuck and Brain Damage, is due to appear in court on assault and weapons charges connected with an incident last month after a confrontation with a man whom he allegedly saw kissing his wife.

      "body": "<p>When Femi Kuti's father, the Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti, died in 1997, it was the first his family knew for certain that he had Aids. \"We suspected much earlier, in 1986,\" says Kuti. \"But we never knew till the doctors confirmed it; he was never tested when he was alive.\" </p> <p>The family decision to announce the cause of the Nigerian superstar's death at 58 marked the start of a campaign by his eldest son against \"silence and stigma\". Kuti recalls: \"There wasn't enough information in Nigeria about Aids, just news from outside saying it was caused by homosexuals, or that it came from monkeys in central Africa. Many of us didn't believe it - and I was one. I thought it was racist propaganda. I'm saddened that it took my father's death for us to take Aids seriously.\" </p> <p>Kuti has added his voice to a new Unicef report, published today, which focuses on Aids as \"the greatest catastrophe facing the continent of Africa\" and beyond. It follows news from the Aids summit in Durban at the weekend that the pandemic kills 2m people a year in Africa and that 23m Africans are infected with HIV. At 37, Kuti is among a growing number of African musicians - including Miriam Makeba and Youssou N'Dour - using their fame to promote HIV awareness on and off stage. While personal bereavement gives Kuti's message an edge, it is carried by his rocketing worldwide success as a vocalist and saxophonist with his band the Positive Force, whose backing singers include his wife Funke and sister Yeni. </p> <p>Shoki Shoki, Kuti's first album on the Talkin' Loud label, was a recording highlight of last year. At the World Music Awards in Monte Carlo in May, he was named bestselling African artist, after being voted best male artist last September in the pan-African Kora awards - Africa's Grammies. Even staunch fans of his father now hail the son as Fela's reincarnation. </p> <p>Yet the sudden glare of publicity after years in his father's shadow has put Kuti in reflective mood. \"A lot of fame is coming to me now,\" he says in London as he heads for a north American tour this month, after sellout concerts in Paris and at the Barbican, London. \"I could say I'm living my dream: it's what I've worked so hard for for 13 years - to be internationally known. But I can't stop thinking about what's going on in Africa. When I go back to Nigeria I'll be able to afford whatever I want, but my people will always be suffering.\" </p> <p>Political dissent is second nature to Kuti, whose father's culture of underground protest against successive military regimes led to frequent jail sentences. His grandmother died after being thrown from a window by soldiers raiding Fela's self-declared republic of Kalakuta. Kuti chose his father's birthday in 1998 to launch his own student-allied Movement Against Second Slavery (Mass), on the eve of elections for Nigeria's first civilian government in 15 years. </p> <p>Noting that 2.7m people in Nigeria are HIV positive, Kuti writes in the Unicef report: \"Failing to educate people about the disease is like signing their death sentence.\" He is outraged that \"no campaign against Aids started in Nigeria until 2000\", and cites poverty and bad leadership as hurdles to altering high-risk behaviour - not least among the Lagos street children once dismissed as \"area boys\", now called \"Fela's people\". </p> <p>\"The youths are hungry and they have no future,\" he says. \"You want to tell them they should not have the only pleasure they get in life - sex? It has to be handled by people who care. The government in Nigeria for the past year has been corrupt and greedy, and these are the leaders who want to educate people about Aids. If I were a youth and didn't have the opportunities I had, I'd never take them seriously; they don't look like people who care.\" </p> <p>More than 1m mourners turned out for Fela's funeral in Nigeria's commercial capital, which Kuti, who played there, remembers with mixed emotions. \"I was sad but overjoyed so many people came. People were weeping, crying 'Fela, Fela'; my father was truly loved. The whole of Lagos was on holiday. The police said no crime was recorded for two days; all the robbers were paying their respects.\" </p> <p>But the man who famously married all 27 of his backing singers in addition to Femi's mother Remi, was often absent from his son's childhood. \"I feel bad he wasn't there when I was young,\" he says. \"But as a father today, I can understand and love him for who he was: a good, courageous man, who stood his ground, with the beatings and jailings - and a man of the people. It's difficult for a man who's loved by millions to have time for his family; he took everybody as his family.\" </p> <p>Kuti joined his father's band, Egypt 80, as a teenage saxophonist. It was a difficult apprenticeship. \"I knew he was a living legend, like a god, a unique genius, and that if I wanted to play music, everyone would be comparing me, saying, 'You're Fela's son, so what have you got to show for it?' \" Fela believed those with a gift need not be taught. \"I had no musical education; I learned in his band, just keeping my eyes and ears open. He'd dictate his songs to me; he might sit on the toilet and say, 'Get a pen and paper and write this down.' \" </p> <p>Kuti took on his father's mantle in 1984, fronting the band at the Hollywood Bowl after Fela was detained at the airport and jailed for 20 months on dubious currency charges (Amnesty International made him a prisoner of conscience). Kuti was by then restless. \"I knew I'd never get what I wanted in his band - to play music. I was in charge of so many affairs; he relied on me.\" </p> <p>There were other frustrations: \"My father had so many wives, every time I picked up my saxophone somebody complained about the noise. My grandmother said, 'Eh, what kind of musician are you? I never hear you practising.' I couldn't sleep that night. I went on a vegetarian diet and started teaching myself scales and to read music. I listened to jazz tapes and read books on Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, John Coltrane.\" </p> <p>Kuti, striving to become a worthy successor, remained in his father's band till his release from jail, then left in 1986 to found his own. \"He was really mad the day I said I was resigning. We didn't talk for five years.\" They were reconciled in 1990, on his grandmother's birthday, when Fela invited his son's struggling band to play on Sundays at his club, the Shrine. \"I could feel the negative vibes that day; all the women were angry - Femi's back. But my father never missed a Sunday.\" </p> <p>Fela's followers were sceptical. \"Sometimes I played to three people in the audience; it was horrible,\" Kuti laughs. \"It took five years, from 1986, to get any audience for our show.\" But by 1995, his album Wonder, Wonder was deemed so good some claimed his father had made it. Kuti has also worked with US rappers such as Common and the Roots, and a Shoki Shoki dance remix has been released. He is also recording a new album, due next year. </p> <p>He plans to use his career \"to do as much as possible to rectify the problems back home\", and is setting up a trust for Mass. He is securely his own man, as evinced by a new song he played at the Barbican last month called 1997. The song, whose title refers to the year in which not only his father died, but also a sister from misdiagnosed cancer, and a cousin, shows that Kuti cannot only animate dancefloors but play mature, soulful sounds. </p> <p>Kuti and family are building a new club not far from the Shrine, which is now closed. The Africa Shrine is to open this autumn. \"It's like a temple, and people depend so much on that heritage; why should I run away from it?\" </p> <p>Though he declines to criticise him (\"Who am I to judge my father?\"), Kuti has turned his back on Fela's lifestyle - the excesses of alcohol and marijuana, and the sexual mores that contributed to his death. \"It's because I saw my father's life that I can rectify some things. I can't go out of control; when I see a beautiful woman, am I not human? But I say, 'Am I ready to see my wife hurt?' No: so I'm going to do everything in my power to keep my marriage.\" </p> <p>He also takes his four-year-old son, Omrinmade - a budding trumpeter - on the road. \"It's very stressful, but I've only got one life, so I'm ready to do anything to keep him beside me. When I hear my son jumping and screaming, I can't explain the joy. That's happiness - and when my band can play every night.\" </p> <p>Unicef's Progress of Nations 2000 is published today.

The fears of the South African government that the conference would become an \"Mbeki-bashing affair\" were realised as fresh salvoes were launched against him for courting so-called \"Aids dissidents\" who deny that HIV causes Aids. Dr Ho, who is at the Aaron Diamond Aids research centre at New York's Rockefeller university and the researcher best known for showing that strong drug cocktails can keep Aids at bay, showed a microscope photograph of the HIV virus attacking a cell. \"This, ladies and gentlemen, is the cause of Aids,\" he declared. His attack was the latest in a string of criticisms of Mr Mbeki's opening speech to the conference on Sunday which many of the 10,000 delegates saw as a wasted opportunity for Mr Mbeki to draw a line under his controversial stance on the disease. The furore surrounding the president has overshadowed the conference's purpose of fighting the scourge of HIV-Aids which now infects more than 34m people and poses a major economic and security threat to the developing world. The London-based Panos Institute told the conference that at least 12m people with HIV worldwide needed drugs to suppress the virus which would cost an estimated $60bn a year at current prices. But Mr Mbeki's role in the debate remained centre stage. Eminent researchers from the US, Europe and South Africa have hit out at Mr Mbeki's speech which, though repeating his determination to fight Aids, focused more on the devastating role of poverty. The president's office dismissed Dr Ho's criticism. \"It's unfair to jump to the conclusion that, because he has the right to ask questions, we are going backwards,\" a spokeswoman said. Reuters",

      "body": "<p>Western complacency over Aids is ill judged because globalisation means we cannot escape the consequences of major epidemics in Africa or Asia, a British expert warned in Durban yesterday.</p> <p>Roy Anderson of the UNAids collaborating centre for epidemiological research, based at Oxford University, said the numbers of people infected with HIV were rising again.</p> <p>\"We have not by any means seen the worst of this problem,\" he said. \"It will get progressively worse over the next 10 to 15 years. People often cite the 1918 influenza pandemic, which caused over 30m deaths. This is going to be many factors bigger than that.\"</p> <p>There is an assumption among some in the west that the problem of Aids has gone away, he said. Drugs are suppressing the virus levels in infected people so that they can live normal lives.</p> <p>But researchers in the field are finding that, as people live longer, so the pool of people infected with HIV who could potentially pass it to others increases, and there is no way of eradicating the virus.</p> <p>\"In the US now, mortality is beginning to rise again very slowly,\" said Professor Anderson. \"The virus becomes resistant to the drugs if people do not take their medication exactly as stipulated by doctors. There has also been an increase in risk-taking behaviour by people who assume the drugs will protect them from Aids and an early death.\"</p> <p>In the UK, there has been a very slow but progressive spread among heterosexuals.</p> <p>\"It is creeping along. We're at the beginning of an epidemic for heterosexuals,\" said Prof Anderson, warning that the full enormity of the global disaster is difficult to estimate. \"People don't fully understand that the timescale is 40 to 50 years for this epidemic.\"</p> <p>The crisis in sub-Saharan Africa, where 25m people are infected with HIV, is a tragedy for the world, he said.</p> <p>\"This is the biggest infectious disease problem that has faced humanity in the course of human history. We can't isolate ourselves. What happens in Africa does matter to us. There are also economic fac tors too. If labour markets are not there because of the enormous burden of disease, that will have a knock-on effect.\"</p> <p>Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US yesterday told the Aids 2000 conference in Durban that even when virus levels had been undetectable in infected people for considerable periods, they soared again within a month of stopping drug treatment.</p> <p>The drugs appear to have little effect on a reservoir of virus in body tissues, even when they suppress it in the blood, he said.</p> <p>But vaccines and cheaper drugs are, nevertheless, the hope for the future. Dr Fauci said he was running trials on interrupted drug regimes - where people whose HIV is under control are taken off medication every other week. His preliminary results show that the viral levels did not go up during the week off.</p> <p>He warned that nobody should experiment alone with stopping their medication, because of the dangers of the virus developing resistance to the drugs.</p> <p>\"The numbers are still small and we need to look at the critical effect after a year or two. But it is encouraging,\" he said.</p>",

Roy Anderson of the UNAids collaborating centre for epidemiological research, based at Oxford University, said the numbers of people infected with HIV were rising again. \"We have not by any means seen the worst of this problem,\" he said. \"It will get progressively worse over the next 10 to 15 years. People often cite the 1918 influenza pandemic, which caused over 30m deaths. This is going to be many factors bigger than that.\" There is an assumption among some in the west that the problem of Aids has gone away, he said. Drugs are suppressing the virus levels in infected people so that they can live normal lives. But researchers in the field are finding that, as people live longer, so the pool of people infected with HIV who could potentially pass it to others increases, and there is no way of eradicating the virus. \"In the US now, mortality is beginning to rise again very slowly,\" said Professor Anderson. \"The virus becomes resistant to the drugs if people do not take their medication exactly as stipulated by doctors. There has also been an increase in risk-taking behaviour by people who assume the drugs will protect them from Aids and an early death.\" In the UK, there has been a very slow but progressive spread among heterosexuals. \"It is creeping along. We're at the beginning of an epidemic for heterosexuals,\" said Prof Anderson, warning that the full enormity of the global disaster is difficult to estimate. \"People don't fully understand that the timescale is 40 to 50 years for this epidemic.\" The crisis in sub-Saharan Africa, where 25m people are infected with HIV, is a tragedy for the world, he said. \"This is the biggest infectious disease problem that has faced humanity in the course of human history. We can't isolate ourselves. What happens in Africa does matter to us. There are also economic fac tors too. If labour markets are not there because of the enormous burden of disease, that will have a knock-on effect.\" Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US yesterday told the Aids 2000 conference in Durban that even when virus levels had been undetectable in infected people for considerable periods, they soared again within a month of stopping drug treatment. The drugs appear to have little effect on a reservoir of virus in body tissues, even when they suppress it in the blood, he said. But vaccines and cheaper drugs are, nevertheless, the hope for the future. Dr Fauci said he was running trials on interrupted drug regimes - where people whose HIV is under control are taken off medication every other week. His preliminary results show that the viral levels did not go up during the week off. He warned that nobody should experiment alone with stopping their medication, because of the dangers of the virus developing resistance to the drugs. \"The numbers are still small and we need to look at the critical effect after a year or two. But it is encouraging,\" he said.",

Many jettison the clothes entirely, not to mention any coherent image of the human body.

Andrea Giacobbe's brilliantly barmy La Com\u00e9die presents a wax-faced, grey-haired man and a little girl with horns, wearing name tags that identify them as God and Humanity. In stills from an weird unmade movie, the two of them play chess and hitchhike. Elsewhere, bodies dissolve entirely into smears of light. Nick Knight, in particular, seems to have an animus against the physical condition, and does everything he can to warp it: in his two series, Sweets and Dolls, he revels in colour and shape, leaving the body as a bendable matrix or a surface for graffiti-like daubs. </p> <p>The best of the book's images venture into textures and images that are autonomous, that have nothing to sell beyond their own aesthetic thrill. But considering the possibilities, it's amazing how many of the artists opt for romantic high gloss, like Vincent Peters, or to the clean visual punning of 70s rock album covers by studios like Hipgnosis. Solve Sundsbo's The Office could be 10cc, Norbert Schoerner's water bottle suspended in mid-air is Pink Floyd, and Poynter's Cunning Stunts - a sci-fi vamp farting fire - has a nasty odour of German heavy metal. </p> <p>While the book is full of big, striking images and expensively executed conceits, what is most exciting is to find a telling detail that brings the technology itself into perspective. St\u00e9phane Sednaoui's series of Mary Anne frolicking with a blurred-light incubus cleverly merges 3-D physicality with 2-D abstraction, but the genius touch is a rainbow streak in the model's hair that apparently has no logical reason to be there, and so suggests a glitch in the otherwise flawless imaging process. Of course it's not really an accident, but it suggests the possibility of a random factor.

      "body": "<p>Over the past few weeks, designer Bob Crowley has been dividing his time between two London theatres. At the Donmar Warehouse, he has been putting the final touches to his designs for Orpheus Descending. A stone's throw away at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, he has been working flat out on The Witches of Eastwick, the latest musical from the stable of Cameron Mackintosh, the producer behind such hits as Les Mis\u00e9rables and Miss Saigon. At the Donmar, Crowley's entire design budget was about \u00a330,000. For The Witches of Eastwick he has had a figure in the region of \u00a32m. </p> <p>So what is the difference, besides the size of the budget, between working on a straight play and a musical? \"The state of people's nerves,\" says Crowley dryly. \"There is just so much at stake.\" </p> <p>Certainly Drury Lane looks like it is in mayhem. Rehearsals on stage are competing with the theatre's regular backstage guided tours, and every nook and cranny of the huge theatre is filled with hustle and bustle as even at this late stage songs are rewritten and the action reshaped. </p> <p>\"When you start working on a play, you have a script and the shape of it doesn't change very much. But a musical changes all the time. It is like a wet fish - you can't ever get hold of it.\" Amid all this chaos the rumpled, amiable Crowley looks remarkably relaxed. </p> <p>\"That's only because I know that they can't really change the set at this stage,\" says Crowley, who finished the designs last November and has been in the theatre since February, watching the set take shape. \" Is it that long?\" he queries himself. \"My, doesn't time fly when you are having seizures.\" </p> <p>For all his self-effacement and slightly bumbling air, Crowley, 48, is about as big as you can get in stage design. He has just scooped a Tony award for Elton John's Aida, and is working on a new John Guare and Marvin Hamlisch musical Sweet Smell of Success with director Nick Hytner; he also has Chekhov's The Seagull lined up (to be performed in New York's Central Park), plus Falstaff at the Metropolitan Opera in New York next summer. He worries about becoming cynical: \"You see a lot of cynical design, particularly with the blockbuster musicals. It is design that is more redolent of a car launch rather than a theatrical experience. You do have to guard against it.\" Crowley also thinks that technology has its place, but only a limited one, in the designer's repertoire. </p> <p>There is nothing cynical about Crowley's designs for The Witches of Eastwick, based on John Updike's novel about three sparky women. Bored out of their minds in a sleepy New England town, they conjure up strange events, and their fantasies are made flesh in the shape of the devilish Darryl Van Horne. </p> <p>Anyone who has followed Crowley since his work with the RSC in the 80s (where he designed Les Liaisons Dangereuses and a memorable As You Like It) and his subsequent work in the late 80s and early 90s at the National Theatre, will recognise Witches as a classic Crowley show. The budget may be bigger, but there is the same exquisite simplicity, a leaning towards the suggestive rather than the explicit. In Crowley's realisation, Eastwick is a place in which \"Norman Rockwell meets Edward Scissorhands\", where beneath the perfectly manicured lawns something strange is taking place. </p> <p>Crowley knows the US east coast mentality and geography well. His first big musical, in 1993, was Nick Hytner's National Theatre revival of the clambake classic Carousel (which also won Crowley a Tony), and he spent some months a few miles outside Salem designing the costumes for the film of The Crucible, starring Daniel Day Lewis and Winona Ryder. Those big, federal houses, restored to within an inch of their lives, and their white picket fences are transfigured into 70s disco kitsch in Crowley's design for the Van Horne mansion as \"Hugh Hefner meets Liberace\". </p> <p> With Crowley getting to play with almost half of the show's projected \u00a34.5m budget, there is an argument for saying that we've reached a point where the designer of a big musical is taking precedence over the director, that he is in fact the more important member of the creative team, reducing the director to the position of steering traffic, ensuring the actors don't bump into the set. Crowley insists that this isn't the case on The Witches of Eastwick, although he says: \"I don't see myself as someone who designs backgrounds for other people's productions. I do conceptualise quite strongly.\" </p> <p>Certainly the equal status of designers and directors is a far cry from the late 70s when Crowley, inspired by the late, great Sean Kenny's pared down, almost Brechtian sets for Oliver!, went to study theatre design at the Bristol Old Vic. \"In those days we were seen as decorators. The programmes would say decor by ...\" </p> <p>Crowley dates the rise of the designer back to Peter Jonas's reign at the ENO in the mid-80s, when young directors and designers started working together to create post-modern reinterpretations of classic operas. \"It was easier to take the license because generally the authors were safely dead,\" he says, pointing out that as designers started to visualise and give a solid presence to intellectual conceits, the roles of the director and designer became increasingly blurred. It was also, suggests Crowley, part of the genius of Cameron Mackintosh that, \"he saw what was happening in opera and applied that to the musical theatre\". </p> <p>The Witches of Eastwick, the first time the West End has seen an original musical comedy in many a moon, may be a far cry from the operatic form of Les Mis\u00e9rables and Miss Saigon, with which Mackintosh is most associated, but Crowley believes that it can weave it's own magic. </p> <p>\"There is a song in it called I Wish I May that takes place entirely in the three women's heads. My job was to try and show that to an audience. And you watch them watching it and suddenly you remember what going to the theatre is all about. Nine times out of 10 when you go to the theatre you have a miserable time, it's boring, it's hot and uncomfortable and you don't like the person sitting next to you. And then suddenly there is a moment that just transports you and makes you believe again and remind you why theatre is so wonderful. It's like being a child again. Maybe adults shouldn't be allowed to go to the theatre. It's much too dangerous.\" </p> <p>The Witches of Eastwick is previewing at Theatre Royal Drury Lane, London WC2.

      "bodyText": "Any patriotic soul, depressed by the state of British sport and the third-world standard of our public services, will be cheered to learn that there is still one area in which this country leads the world ... corporate bribery. Of the 54 firms the World Bank has barred from involvement in its projects, no less than 36 are British. Hurrah! Meanwhile, four UK firms are on trial in Lesotho for alleged bribery concerning a Lesotho dam project. Apparently one of these, Balfour Beatty (the civil engineering giant whose office was recently raided by the FBI over a rail modernisation scheme in Boston) is suggesting that it is not on trial in Lesotho at all. We are happy to clear up any confusion. The firm is still on trial as part of a consortium, but the case has been suspended due to the disappearance of a key witness, one Max Cohen, the Swiss businessman accused on the charge sheet of carrying a bribe for Balfour Beatty. Interpol, which has issued a warrant for Mr Cohen's arrest, may be interested to know that his address in Switzerland is Rennweg 32, Zurich. \u0095 Did anyone else know that actor Russell Crowe is a first cousin of the great New Zealand batsman Martin Crowe? Their fathers are brothers. This is not the only sport/movie acting family relationship to concern us (you recall that Sun football writer Steven Howard is the nephew of Gone With the Wind star Leslie Howard), and if we have many more days as quiet as yesterday, it almost certainly won't be the last. \u0095 And people dare to suggest he's cracking up under the strain!

Those present were singer-songwriter Alex Glasgow, director Bill Hays and myself - all native north-easterners. Indeed, I once said to a Labour MP during a radio interview: \"I was born in Jarrow - beat that for credentials.\" </p> <p>Sid gave us some stories, Alex wrote the songs, Richard Fynes's 1873 classic The Miners of Northumberland and Durham gave us all the history we needed, and inherited prejudice did the rest. I assembled the bits into a show called Close the Coalhouse Door, which opened in April 1968 at the old Newcastle Playhouse (later demolished in the cause of \"road improvements\") to rave notices and sell-out business. </p> <p>On the first night my agent, Peggy Ramsay, grabbed my arm after and said: \"My God, darling, this is revolutionary.\" Later, when the London managements came hot on its trail, she said it was much too tough for the West End. She was right. Brian Rix, a former Bevin boy, bravely put the show on at the Fortune Theatre to more rave reviews - the critics voted it the best musical of the year - and sparse audiences, most of whom I subsequently met. </p> <p>It was when the revivals began that the project got a little complicated. The form of the show is the golden wedding party of Thomas and Mary Milburn. The guests reminisce about the history of their village and Brockenback pit (a real name Sid provided), starting in the 1830s and finishing in the present. The style of the piece begins with documentary realism, then drifts through vaudeville into a kind of unspoken surrealism. </p> <p>In the third act Lord Hailsham turns up and sings a song called My Little Cloth Cap, closely followed by Harold Wilson with the words: \"Good evening, brothers, I've just popped in to explain the government's fuel policy.\" </p> <p>The problem was defining the \"now\". Ted Heath arrived on the scene and was written into the show, as were the successful miners' strikes of 1972 and 1974. I wrote the amendments for the 1974 Leeds Playhouse revival by candlelight, during the blackouts resulting from Sailor Ted's three-day weeks. But the narrative logic meant that our central couple, Thomas and Mary (named after my grandparents) became older and older and the show got longer and longer. </p> <p>Arguably, the most adventurous version was performed by a fringe company from Wales, as a three-hander. They presented it as a radio play, with the three performers gathered around a microphone in the centre of the stage. </p> <p>The most explosive was a production in Musselburgh, a (then) mining community east of Edinburgh, during the 1984-5 strike. At the end, the local colliery band marched in and lined up behind the actors, banners flying, for Alex's final sardonic chorus: \"It's only a story - a fanciful tale.\" </p> <p>I took part in an onstage discussion after the show with NUM and community representatives. British Coal had promised a spokesperson - presumably one of Thatcher's lesser lackeys - but he didn't show up. It was a wise decision. </p> <p>The show continues to be performed by amateur groups and schools - even once in a prison - wherever there's a mining tradition. A decade ago, when working at the Australian Film School in Sydney, I had a call from a campus in Newcastle, New South Wales, to say it was on their syllabus and would I come to talk to staff and students about it? </p> <p>So far, so nostalgic. At this point, one of my lesser fantasies takes over. My desk has a visit from a royal personage who accepts the flowers and says: \"One must have seen a great many changes while one has been writing one's plays.\" To which one says: \"You bet, babe.\" </p> <p>For a start, when we were casting the original show, it was difficult finding actors who would admit to being Geordies. Bolton-born Bryan Pringle qualified by having an Auntie Bella in Gateshead. </p> <p>On the other hand, we were able to afford a bigger and better cast because the BBC threw some money (memory says it was \u00a3400) into the stage production in exchange for the television rights which, in those days, meant a single showing on The Wednesday Play. The tape was apparently wiped long ago. </p> <p> T hirty years on, the Geordie accent is part of our national culture and, according to research, is universally trusted. Robson Green, Kevin Whateley, Jimmy Nail and Tim Healy are bankable lead actors in the eyes of television executives. </p> <p>Consequently, casting the most recent revival at Newcastle's Live Theatre was easy, except in terms of economics. Most regional theatres have lived on the breadline since the 80s. The original production had a cast of 11, plus a five-band brass ensemble. The revival had a cast of eight brilliant and versatile performers who played their own instruments. Both productions had a brass band on special occasions. We didn't bother to ask whether anyone would be interested in a television version. </p> <p>So much for luvvie talk. What about the subject - the pits, the pitmen and their communities? It's no state secret. Thatcher and her imported hitman, McGregor, set out to destroy them and succeeded. In the latest, and probably last, version of the play, there's a brief exchange among the characters about the 1984-5 strike. </p> <p>\"The best ever. Because it wasn't about money.\" </p> <p>\"But we lost, didn't we?\" </p> <p>\"It's still too early to say.\" </p> <p>The cute people in Whitehall who are doing their best to remove the politics from politics would love us to believe that there are no longer such things as the working class, union solidarity or folk memory. To be sure, something very profound happens to a region when there are more art galleries than shipyards on the Tyne, when mining is something that happens in heritage museums, when disused pits are turned into dry ski slopes. </p> <p>The industrial revolution is apparently over and our show, originally written as a hymn of praise to the miners, is now an elegy for a lost world.

But if you were that interested in the first place, you'd probably prefer something that lingered more vividly in the memory from the show's golden years, like the disgusting saliva-squirting Roy Hattersley, the Queen Mother brilliantly warped into a gin-guzzling Gracie Fields, or - reflecting the show's beginnings during the white heat of Thatcherism - one of its sequence of increasingly deranged, eyeball-rolling Margaret Thatchers. </p> <p>If merely portraying people as grey was as far as Spitting Image had ever gone, it would never have deserved to get on television at all, let alone run for 14 years after its inauguration in 1984.

Sometime education secretary Kenneth Baker was depicted as an oleaginous slug (he is reported not to be interested in buying his puppet), while former Liberal leader David Steel blamed Spitting Image for destroying his political credibility after it persistently depicted him as a finger-puppet poking out of a macabre David Owen's pocket, squawking excitable nonsense.

In the mid-80s, yuppies soaked in Laurent Perrier champagne skidded their Porsches around the City's Square Mile against a backdrop of the Falklands War and the police-state brutality which the Thatcher government had mobilised against Arthur Scargill's striking miners. It was enough to generate a panicky sense that the foundations were slipping underneath a society which had previously been fairly calm and orderly, give or take the occasional political sex scandal or punk rock revolution.

In 1981, they first proposed a TV series using puppets based on their original models, though Spitting Image didn't go into production until 1984. Fittingly, Fluck and Law based themselves in a workshop in Limehouse, in the midst of the Docklands that came to sym bolise the 80s property boom. The show's first season was nearly its last. Having initially grabbed an impressive audience of eight million, Image found its viewers abandoning it in droves as the debut series wore on.

The revelation came as police acknowledged the possibility of ties between the Japanese underworld and the Casablanca club, which is a focus of the investigation into Miss Blackman's disappearance. Miss Blackman, 21, a former British Airways stewardess, had been working at the club for less than two months when she went missing on July 1. Police suspect she may have been abducted by a customer. Last night her father, Tim Blackman, flew out to join her sister, Sophie, in the search for his daughter. Her mother issued a statement saying: \"If you are a parent, then maybe if you have a very close relationship with your child, then maybe you have some idea of what I am going through. I have no desire to speak with the press about how I am feeling.\" According to a source familiar with the city's seedy Roppongi district, the Casablanca is known among hostesses as a popular haunt for gangsters. \"It pays well and recruits only the most attractive foreign women, but all the girls bitch that it is dangerous because lots of Yakuza go there,\" the source said. That reputation dates back at least five years, when an American woman working at the Casablanca suddenly packed up her bags and took the next plane home. \"She was freaked by a customer who followed her around for three or four days. She thought he was a big time gangster because he would wait for her after work in a big car with tinted windows,\" the source said. \"Although she tried changing her routes to and from work, she eventually left the country because she was so scared.\" Toshiko Mii, deputy superintendent of the Azabu police station, did not rule out a gangster connection with Lucie's disappearance. \"It is true that Yakuza are often linked to these kinds of bars, but we don't yet know if that is the case this time. We need to gather more information. Police are also investigating a call from a man claiming that Miss Blackman, who was in debt, had gone with him to join a religious sect. The Guardian was present when detectives visited the Casablanca to inquire about two men, believed to have been customers. They also requested records of Miss Blackman's salary. Located on the sixth floor of a building that hosts a transvestite bar and a \"topless, bottomless\" gentleman's club, the Casablanca appears innocuous. Walk through the heavy iron door and the interior is simple, Apart from a dozen high padded stalls and a few low tables, the only features are a bar the size of a kitchen counter and a large karaoke machine.

      "bodyText": "ONdigital, the pay-television operator, yesterday announced that it would meet its target of 1m subscribers by the end of the year, boosted by its acquisition of rights to English league football and a new television internet service. It said that 774,000 households are now signed up to the digital terrestrial TV network, up 15% in the last quarter. But analysts said there were signs of that the rate of growth is beginning to slow. ONdigital, owned by the ITV broadcasters Carlton and Granada, said it would start a TV internet service in the autumn, and a new premium sports channel next year. The chief executive, Stuart Prebble, said sports rights were driving up its subscriber base, and it would seek to acquire more. The broadcaster said it had experienced a three-fold increase in subscribers in the past year and was on course to reach 2m by the end of 2002.

It is understood that a further 15,000 have received free or discounted integrated digital television sets. BSkyB, ONdigital's satellite rival, has notched up 3.4m digital subscribers, half of whom did not have digital television before.
