Anderson, who was awarded \u00a37,500 damages and \u00a345,000 in legal costs, said yesterday: \"Some of the women who have been invited phoned to say 'thank you' for what I have done.\" Asked about next month's dinner, she said: \"I don't think I have been asked to go and I would like to.\" She sued after two rebuffs by the PFA over the annual dinner. In 1997 Anderson was asked to leave after being invited by Sheffield United players she represented. In 1998 she was refused admission after being invited by her client Julian Dicks \"because of restrictions on space\". Hoey has already said she will attend this year's ground-breaking function and so has Powell, who said: \"This is another indication of the growth in acceptance of the women's game. We have always invited men to our awards lunch and I will be accepting the reciprocal offer.\"",

The country's seven European Cup triumphs of the late 70s and early 80s were long gone. Italian clubs, it seemed, had a season ticket to the final. How quickly things can change. Now two English teams, Chelsea and Manchester United, are in the quarter-finals and by next Wednesday Italy's interest could have vanished. With Lazio in danger of being edged out by Feyenoord in Group D should they lose at Stamford Bridge next week, when United are in Valencia, and Fiorentina imperilled by Wednesday's 3-1 defeat at Old Trafford in Group B, the prospect of Serie A disappearing before the knock-out stage is real indeed. Not that this will worry United or Chelsea. Already their main concern must be that they avoid one another until the final in Paris on May 24. United and Chelsea will not be paired in the quarter-finals, for which the draw will be made a week today, provided both win their groups or both finish runners-up. Chelsea can finish second only if they lose at home to Lazio next Wednesday and United will end up second only if Valencia beat them by at least three goals on Tuesday. Sir Alex Ferguson, the United manager, has said that, whether his team finished first or second, it would make little difference to their chances of successfully defending the European Cup. Except that staying top would avoid an early confrontation with Barcelona or Bayern Munich, who have already won groups A and C. On this week's evidence United and Chelsea both look well capable of reaching the Stade de France just over two months from now, though seldom can two sides from the same country have achieved impressive victories on successive evenings in such contrasting styles. In Rotterdam on Tuesday Gianluca Vialli's team fixed Feyenoord with a cobra's eye before striking with lethal accuracy, apart from Frank Leboeuf's missed penalty that is. Gianfranco Zola, Dennis Wise and Tore Andre Flo each finished with the kind of flourish that is sometimes lacking in Chelsea's domestic games. It was a supremely cool performance that had Feyenoord looking disheartened long before the end. True, the Dutch side are an inelegant parody of what they once were but they had just beaten Lazio 2-1 in Rome and it said much for Chelsea that Feyenoord were denied the opportunity to capitalise on that result.

The thunderous shot from Gabriel Batistuta, which scorched the hands of Mark Bosnich as the Argentine gave Fiorentina an early lead, jolted United out of their season's torpor and from then on Ferguson's players were like amnesiacs who had found sudden and total recall. Andy Cole, playing in a slightly different role which involved linking with Ryan Giggs on the left, was United's outstanding player, quickly bringing the scores level before Roy Keane and Dwight Yorke completed a notable victory. At half-time Kevin Keegan, wearing his television pundit's hat, thought that Keane was having a quiet game. Perhaps the England coach was watching the match on a small monitor.",

They would also reverse all further tax cuts introduced by Labour, including a 1p cut in the basic ratedue to come into force next month.</p> <p>The Lib Dem leader, Charles Kennedy, yesterday accused the Conservatives and Labour of holding a `Dutch auction on who can cut taxes the most when the British people want better funding for public services''.</p> <p>Mr Taylor will seek to portray Tuesday's budget as a `litmus test' of Labour's commitment to tax cutting or improving public services. Having cleared the \u00a328bn deficit Labour inherited from the Tories, Mr Brown now had the chance to show his commit ment to delivering better healthcare and education. The Lib Dems would reverse the 1p cut to fund a \u00a32.65bn increase in spending on education. At the same time they would dip into the chancellor's estimated \u00a37bn `war chest' to boost spending on the NHS.</p> <p>The basic state pension would be increased by \u00a32 a week with higher rises for the over 75s, funded from unspent social security reserves due to the fall in unemployment.</p> <p>Mr Taylor said his proposals represented a slight `tightening' of the government's fiscal stance, and would not cause the Bank of England to raise interest rates.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A 50p in the pound tax on Britain's highest earners is proposed by the Liberal Democrats in an alternative budget intended to challenge chancellor Gordon Brown to choose between tax cuts and investment in public services. An estimated 204,000 people with an annual income of over pounds 100,000 would fall into the new top bracket, raising \u00a32.6bn a year, according to the document published by Lib Dem treasury spokesman Matthew Taylor. The party would use the money to cut the tax burden for those on low incomes by abolishing the 10% tax band, taking 1.4m people out of tax completely. They would also reverse all further tax cuts introduced by Labour, including a 1p cut in the basic ratedue to come into force next month. The Lib Dem leader, Charles Kennedy, yesterday accused the Conservatives and Labour of holding a `Dutch auction on who can cut taxes the most when the British people want better funding for public services''. Mr Taylor will seek to portray Tuesday's budget as a `litmus test' of Labour's commitment to tax cutting or improving public services. Having cleared the \u00a328bn deficit Labour inherited from the Tories, Mr Brown now had the chance to show his commit ment to delivering better healthcare and education. The Lib Dems would reverse the 1p cut to fund a \u00a32.65bn increase in spending on education. At the same time they would dip into the chancellor's estimated \u00a37bn `war chest' to boost spending on the NHS. The basic state pension would be increased by \u00a32 a week with higher rises for the over 75s, funded from unspent social security reserves due to the fall in unemployment. Mr Taylor said his proposals represented a slight `tightening' of the government's fiscal stance, and would not cause the Bank of England to raise interest rates.",

Carlo Maria Giulini (Deutsche Grammophon) with the Vienna Philharmonic sounds spacious to some, laboured and over-reverent to others; Georg Solti (Decca) drives the music as fiercely as expected, squeezing out the intimacy in the process; Christoph von Dohnanyi (Decca) takes a direct, slightly clinical approach that leaves too little room for imagination, while Daniel Barenboim (Erato) shapes the music with great expressive freedom, using the flexibility of Wilhelm F\u00fcrtw\u00e4ngler as his model, and Gunter Wand (RCA), revered now in some quarters, is straightforward to the point of becoming prosaic. </p> <p>The earlier of Bernard Haitink's two versions, recorded with the Concertgebouw Orchestra in the 1970s is straightforward to the point of being noble; wonderfully spaced and rhythmically exact, it's available at mid price from Philips as part of a four-disc survey of all Brahms orchestral works which is consistently first rate. </p> <p>The second account by Claudio Abbado (Deutsche Grammophon, with the Berlin Philharmonic), mellow and eloquent, is worth hearing, and, as an antidote to all these sumptuous modern orchestral versions, so too is Charles Mackerras's (Telarc), with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra reviving the scale of performance Brahms would have known.

      "body": "<p>Greg Dyke, the director general of the BBC, is to scrap up to 1,000 jobs and remake the corporation as a flatter, leaner organisation under a secret plan to be approved by the BBC's governors next week. </p> <p>In response to a call by Chris Smith, the culture secretary, for the BBC to practice self-help and find \u00a31.1bn in savings, Mr Dyke will banish the BBC's bureaucracy to put money back into programmes. </p> <p>The corporation's legendary reliance on consultants and its convoluted pyramid management structure will be undone in a fundamental makeover. Mr Dyke's restructuring process will result in the loss of up to 1,000 jobs as its effects are felt throughout the BBC, according to a report in a trade newspaper yesterday. </p> <p>Initially, it is thought, there will be several hundred redundancies, with the focus on senior management. One insider yesterday described that as a \"bloodbath at the top\". Mr Dyke is understood to be keen to lead from the top and to set an example by putting staff directly under his control. </p> <p>Instead of having six directorates, each with its own chief executive, layers of management, administrative staff and auxiliary functions, Mr Dyke is expected to create up to 16 new departments, all answerable directly to him. </p> <p>In Mr Dyke's BBC, programme-makers will, for the first time since his predecessor Lord Birt took over the corporation, answer directly to the director general. </p> <p>As the news leaked out, Mr Dyke moved to reassure BBC staff, issuing a note explaining that he would make a full announcement in a couple of weeks. He described the reports as \"speculation\". </p> <p>Signing the note, \"yours, Greg\", he confirmed that he had told MPs last week that he intended to cut the corporation's overheads to 15% of its budget, from the present 26%.

      "bodyText": "Greg Dyke, the director general of the BBC, is to scrap up to 1,000 jobs and remake the corporation as a flatter, leaner organisation under a secret plan to be approved by the BBC's governors next week. In response to a call by Chris Smith, the culture secretary, for the BBC to practice self-help and find \u00a31.1bn in savings, Mr Dyke will banish the BBC's bureaucracy to put money back into programmes. The corporation's legendary reliance on consultants and its convoluted pyramid management structure will be undone in a fundamental makeover. Mr Dyke's restructuring process will result in the loss of up to 1,000 jobs as its effects are felt throughout the BBC, according to a report in a trade newspaper yesterday. Initially, it is thought, there will be several hundred redundancies, with the focus on senior management. One insider yesterday described that as a \"bloodbath at the top\". Mr Dyke is understood to be keen to lead from the top and to set an example by putting staff directly under his control. Instead of having six directorates, each with its own chief executive, layers of management, administrative staff and auxiliary functions, Mr Dyke is expected to create up to 16 new departments, all answerable directly to him. In Mr Dyke's BBC, programme-makers will, for the first time since his predecessor Lord Birt took over the corporation, answer directly to the director general. As the news leaked out, Mr Dyke moved to reassure BBC staff, issuing a note explaining that he would make a full announcement in a couple of weeks. He described the reports as \"speculation\". Signing the note, \"yours, Greg\", he confirmed that he had told MPs last week that he intended to cut the corporation's overheads to 15% of its budget, from the present 26%. He added that he would substantially improve the amount spent on programmes. Sources said Mr Dyke intended to create a handful of \"super departments\" to control programme making, with each genre having its own programme development budget. The sources added that he hoped this would ease pressure on the heads of BBC1 and BBC2, enabling them to take more strategic decisions and develop programmes in other media, such as the internet. Non programme-making departments will be cut. The policy and planning and corporate affairs units are expected to be merged, as are finance and IT, with a large part of the savings expected to be made from cutting overlapping jobs. Mr Dyke's plans have been constructed in strict secrecy, with only a handful of trusted aides, including the director of personnel, Gareth Jones, aware of his plans. Even press officers have not been briefed on the future structure, with that department said to be facing substantial rationalisation. The news emerged yesterday as the committee charged with implementing the proposals moved into action. A source close to Mr Dyke said: \"It's about self-help and tough love - all the tough decisions that the government told us to take when they agreed the new funding. Greg has kept the details very close to himself.\" Some of the BBC's longest-serving top executives face an uncertain future.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>After 27 years as the driving force behind Parisian label Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo is in a league of her own. She is the ultimate experimentalist, rejecting traditional notions of sexiness and femininity in favour of deconstructed, edgy clothes which are as difficult to wear as they are beautiful. In May, she is to be presented with a prestigious Excellence in Design Award from the Harvard Design School. </p> <p>Kawakubo's perfumes are as original as her clothes: heady and highly unusual, in a market saturated with florals and musks, they stand out for their curious topnotes. So perhaps it is only natural that Kawakubo has taken the unprecedented step of opening a shop devoted entirely to them. For what better way to offer the customer pure, undiluted essence of Comme? </p> <p>Up until now, the only places you could lay your hands on designer toiletries were hectic department stores, where your nose soon gets confused by the myriad scents on offer. \"It is much easier to say what we want about perfume if we have our own space totally dedicated to that purpose. As with our clothes, the total environment is important,\" Kawakubo explains. \"Perfume is more than just fragrance in a bottle.\" </p> <p>The pink glass-fronted shop is a quiet haven away from the hustle and bustle of Parisian streets. Kawakubo may be referred to as the designer who \"invented\" black, but the shop she has designed is small, airy, minimalist and completely white. </p> <p>\"It was created to explore the seven sensations,\" says Aurore Besson, PR manager for Comme fragrances. \"Light, sight, touch, air, smell, sensibility and memory.\" The white walls and concrete floor are bare, with two moulded shelves on one side, upon which are carefully positioned one bottle of each size of perfume: \"So they have their own identity,\" Besson explains. There's no clutter and no fuss, just a reverential kind of spareness. </p> <p>It was Coco Chanel who, in 1921, first saw the potential of creating a fragrance that would appeal to the masses and be affordable to more people than the elite who bought her clothes. Chanel No 5 was the first perfume ever to bear the name of a fashion label: before this, they were two separate industries. These days, any designer with an ounce of business sense has launched a fragrance or few. It's big business: the UK market alone was worth \u00a3688m in 1999. </p> <p>Kawakubo's shop isn't a money-making venture, though: she is doing it for love. Those of you unfamiliar with Comme des Gar\u00e7ons perfumes may be interested to know that, Christmas limited editions aside, they have only four fragrances to their name: Odeur 53, Eau de Parfum, Eau de Cologne and last year's Comme 2. Even with Kawakubo's penchant for minimalism, this makes for a pretty sparse range of products. Which is why she has created a new range of distinctive fragrances to be sold in the shop and in only eight other key places in the world, including Liberty in London. </p> <p>Series 1, which is in-store now, comprises five new scents under the collective title of Leaves: Tea, Lily, Mint, Shiso and Calamus, priced from \u00a317.50 to \u00a330 and in bottles of plain plastic. \"We wanted there to be a clear distinction between Series 1 and our previous fragrances,\" Besson says. Series 2 is being worked on at the moment; new series will simply be added to previous ones, thus building up the shop's stock until, presumably, it resembles something like a regular store. </p> <p>To avoid the multiple-smells-on-wrist problem, Kawakubo provides individual white paper cones to spray each fragrance on.

      "bodyText": "After 27 years as the driving force behind Parisian label Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo is in a league of her own. She is the ultimate experimentalist, rejecting traditional notions of sexiness and femininity in favour of deconstructed, edgy clothes which are as difficult to wear as they are beautiful. In May, she is to be presented with a prestigious Excellence in Design Award from the Harvard Design School. Kawakubo's perfumes are as original as her clothes: heady and highly unusual, in a market saturated with florals and musks, they stand out for their curious topnotes. So perhaps it is only natural that Kawakubo has taken the unprecedented step of opening a shop devoted entirely to them. For what better way to offer the customer pure, undiluted essence of Comme? Up until now, the only places you could lay your hands on designer toiletries were hectic department stores, where your nose soon gets confused by the myriad scents on offer. \"It is much easier to say what we want about perfume if we have our own space totally dedicated to that purpose. As with our clothes, the total environment is important,\" Kawakubo explains. \"Perfume is more than just fragrance in a bottle.\" The pink glass-fronted shop is a quiet haven away from the hustle and bustle of Parisian streets. Kawakubo may be referred to as the designer who \"invented\" black, but the shop she has designed is small, airy, minimalist and completely white. \"It was created to explore the seven sensations,\" says Aurore Besson, PR manager for Comme fragrances. \"Light, sight, touch, air, smell, sensibility and memory.\" The white walls and concrete floor are bare, with two moulded shelves on one side, upon which are carefully positioned one bottle of each size of perfume: \"So they have their own identity,\" Besson explains. There's no clutter and no fuss, just a reverential kind of spareness. It was Coco Chanel who, in 1921, first saw the potential of creating a fragrance that would appeal to the masses and be affordable to more people than the elite who bought her clothes. Chanel No 5 was the first perfume ever to bear the name of a fashion label: before this, they were two separate industries. These days, any designer with an ounce of business sense has launched a fragrance or few. It's big business: the UK market alone was worth \u00a3688m in 1999. Kawakubo's shop isn't a money-making venture, though: she is doing it for love. Those of you unfamiliar with Comme des Gar\u00e7ons perfumes may be interested to know that, Christmas limited editions aside, they have only four fragrances to their name: Odeur 53, Eau de Parfum, Eau de Cologne and last year's Comme 2. Even with Kawakubo's penchant for minimalism, this makes for a pretty sparse range of products. Which is why she has created a new range of distinctive fragrances to be sold in the shop and in only eight other key places in the world, including Liberty in London. Series 1, which is in-store now, comprises five new scents under the collective title of Leaves: Tea, Lily, Mint, Shiso and Calamus, priced from \u00a317.50 to \u00a330 and in bottles of plain plastic. \"We wanted there to be a clear distinction between Series 1 and our previous fragrances,\" Besson says. Series 2 is being worked on at the moment; new series will simply be added to previous ones, thus building up the shop's stock until, presumably, it resembles something like a regular store. To avoid the multiple-smells-on-wrist problem, Kawakubo provides individual white paper cones to spray each fragrance on. Small bean-filled dolls are also on offer for a more tactile experience. \"We tried to achieve a space where all kinds of sensorial experimentation is possible, where research, technology, discovery and creation are at the forefront,\" Kawakubo says. It is the unpromisingly-named Odeur 71 which she is really excited about, though. To be introduced in May, the fragrance will be an extension of Odeur 53, with the added ingredients of wood-shavings, pepper, ginger and Chinese ink. These are extracted through a new method called Solid Phase Micro Extraction, with which a fibre needle is placed near an object to extract its smell. \"Through this method, the world becomes full of smells to analyse and recreate. You could even extract the smell of a hot rubber tyre from a car,\" Besson explains excitedly. Odeur 71, she says, will evoke a feeling of hot and cold, as if you were smelling the ingredients individually. Odeur 53 has 53 ingredients - but there are apparently more than 71 in the new fragrance. So why the name? \"Well, eight is a good number. Five plus three equals eight, and seven plus one equals eight, so that is the reason.\" Which best sums up why Rei Kawakubo's perfume shop will undoubtedly be a success: quirky it may be, but there is method in its madness.",

A big midweek day at the races with the lads was scheduled to finish up in a karaoke club, so it may be worth chancing Crewe to do a number on Pompey on Saturday - on the grounds that the south-coast side will venture north feeling a little jaded.

As the Conservative Party celebrate their first directly elected seat in the Scottish parliament today, the postmortem for Labour begins in earnest. A disillusioned Ayr electorate voted them into a humiliating third place in the parliament's historic first byelection yesterday, behind the victorious Tories and a resurgent Scottish National Party. And although the constituency is small, the results are making waves beyond the boundaries of this small market town, some 30 miles south of Glasgow. Fresh questions are being raised about the first minister, Donald Dewar's, leadership; the performance of the ruling Labour-Liberal Democrat administration at Holyrood; and the general direction of Tony Blair's New Labour. Mr Dewar has been quick to blame \"distractions\" - such as the high profile advertising campaign against the repeal of section 28 - for the failure of their candidate, Rita Miller. Opposition parties say the message sent by voters is unequivocal. Labour is not delivering; for Ayr, for Scotland, for the UK. The Conservatives, meanwhile, have found it difficult to contain their delight. \"It's a bloody good result for us,\" said the party's Scottish chairman Raymond Robertson this morning. The Tory candidate, John Scott, a well-known local farmer, has impressed voters with his emphasis on local concerns and his unwillingness to use Ayr as a proving ground for broader national issues such as section 28 or the state of the Scottish parliament building. The Scottish National Party, meanwhile, say their second place finish, after a strong, slick campaign, is a building block for the push towards independence. The Liberal Democrats, Labour's coalition partners in the Holyrood administration, are not saying much at all, having been pushed into fifth place by the Scottish Socialist Party. But all eyes are now on Labour to see how they handle the message from Ayr. However they play it, it will be almost impossible to spin their way out of this one.",

Alchemy will take over the MG brand as \"medium volume business\" and develop a range of sports cars and saloons for a premium \"niche\" market, the first of which could start production within 18 months. Mr Moulton said that fewer than 100,000 cars a year would be built by the new MG Car Company - a fraction of the previous output.</p> <p>John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB union, condemned the move. \"Rover has become a corporate car boot sale,\" he said. \"I will be asking for some straight answers from the Department of Trade and Industry. Surely during the negotiations with BMW last year, the DTI asked for guarantees that Rover would not be broken up? If guarantees were given by BMW, what is the DTI going to do to enforce them? \"The strong pound has had a big part to play in this chaos. It is high time the government realised that this continuing overvaluation can and will lead to more job losses,\" he added.</p> <p>Workers arriving this morning at Longbridge remained pessimistic about the future.

Last year, the Solihull plant turned out 166,000 vehicles. Union leader Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, welcomed Ford's decision to buy Land Rover but said he would have preferred the entire Rover group to stay with one owner. Alchemy Partners, the new Rover owners, today offered some consolation to the 9,000-strong workforce at Longbridge. Managing partner Jon Moulton said that there were two groups of workers at the Birmingham plant: those who would keep their jobs and those who would not. \"Those that are left will have real, viable jobs and won't be spending their lives looking over their shoulders awaiting termination and redundancy,\" added. The Rover marque, however, will be allowed to \"wither on the vine\". Alchemy will take over the MG brand as \"medium volume business\" and develop a range of sports cars and saloons for a premium \"niche\" market, the first of which could start production within 18 months. Mr Moulton said that fewer than 100,000 cars a year would be built by the new MG Car Company - a fraction of the previous output. John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB union, condemned the move. \"Rover has become a corporate car boot sale,\" he said. \"I will be asking for some straight answers from the Department of Trade and Industry. Surely during the negotiations with BMW last year, the DTI asked for guarantees that Rover would not be broken up? If guarantees were given by BMW, what is the DTI going to do to enforce them? \"The strong pound has had a big part to play in this chaos. It is high time the government realised that this continuing overvaluation can and will lead to more job losses,\" he added. Workers arriving this morning at Longbridge remained pessimistic about the future. The main BMW sign outside Gate Q of the Longbridge factory had been daubed in graffiti with the words \"Stabbed in the back\".",

It means that British beef will be back on sale in Germany early in April, although Britain's beef exports to the country amounted to less than 2% of German consumption before the ban. Most of Germany's 16 states had previously opposed lifting the import ban, saying they wanted safeguards to make sure British beef would be clearly identifiable, but chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's government had long urged the states to vote for lifting the ban, warning that the EU could impose heavy fines if it were not lifted. The centre-left government came up last month with a compromise plan to soothe the states' concerns about labelling the beef. Meanwhile, British scientists have established tests which for the first time will allow them to diagnose people with the human form of \"mad cow disease\" before they die. Until now doctors could only be sure a person had new variant CJD once they had died and a brain biopsy could be carried out. But medical advances and new research mean experts have established criteria which enable them to say CJD is the \"probable\" cause of someone's illness. Living, \"probable\" CJD victims will be included in the department of health's monthly figures for the first time from April. So far 52 people have died from new variant CJD since it was identified in 1995. Interim figures show that there are 12 living patients in the UK with probable CJD and three other people who have died but whose relatives were still awaiting confirmation that the disease was the cause of death. The policy change was ordered by the deputy chief medical officer Dr Pat Troop on the advice of the spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee (Seac), the government's expert body on BSE and CJD. Dr Troop said: \"Being able to count and record the number of living sufferers will allow us to make more accurate predictions about the future of this disease. \"This is now possible because diagnostic tests have been very accurate in identifying 'probable' CJD in severely neurologically impaired patients. \"However there is no test available to detect those who may be infected with CJD in the pre-clinical [before people fall ill] stage. \"Developing such a test remains one of the department of health's research priorities.\" Victims normally suffer from the progressively debilitating disease, which has no cure, for an average of 14 months but some live for more than three years. The new criteria mean that patients should be able to be identified as \"probable\" CJD sufferers within six months of the first signs.",

The Tories absolutely failed to move off their percentage vote, and fell in their absolute vote. So they haven't moved forward at all, we have moved downwards. The SNP will be disappointed as well.\" The result in the previously marginal seat, from a turnout of 56.96%, increases the pressure on first minister Donald Dewar's embattled coalition administration. It will also worry Labour party officials and Tony Blair's government, which could be little more than a year away from a general election. If the 15.97% swing from Labour to Tory since 1997 recorded at Ayr was repeated across the whole of Britain at a general election, William Hague would sweep into Downing Street. Mr Scott, who polled 12,580 votes, said in his victory speech: \"This result signals the revival of the Scottish Tory party is well and truly under way. \"The election has sent a very strong message to Donald Dewar and Tony Blair demanding that they stop and listen to the priorities of the electorate. \"I will start my work tomorrow delivering my promise to put the Scottish parliament on the right track.\" The result of the byelection, caused by the resignation of Labour's Ian Welsh - partly over frustration at backbench life - was hailed by backers of the campaign to keep Section 28, which bans councils from \"promoting\" homosexuality. Keep Clause 28 campaign director Jack Irvine said: \"Donald Dewar did not listen to the people of Scotland and his party paid the price at Ayr.\" But international development minister George Foulkes said the campaign had also been obscured by the Keep the Clause campaign, funded by Stagecoach millionaire Brian Souter. Mr Foulkes said: \"Every time we tried to return to the main issues, we returned to that [section 28]. \"That has been a distortion of democracy,\" said Mr Foulkes, who added that the anti-repeal campaigners had spent more than all the other candidates put together. \"The circumstances of the byelection were not good for us, the mid-term of a government, traditional Tory territory, which until Sandra Osborne won the seat spectacularly in 1997 had been Tory for 100 years, the smallest Labour majority in the whole of the UK, and the MSP resigning in difficult circumstances. \"This was a unique result which cannot be extrapolated anywhere else.\" Ayr was the Scottish parliament's most marginal seat, with Labour winning a majority of just 25 votes in last May's elections for the Scottish parliament, compared with 6,543 in the 1997 general election. The byelection result, which gives the Tories their first directly-elected Scottish parliament member, marked a swing of 8.7% from Labour to the Tories since last year's elections. It is also the Tories' first parliamentary byelection success in Scotland since 1973 when they defended Edinburgh North. Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National Party, which had the biggest vote rise of 9.5%, said: \"The SNP have done astonishingly well. To come anywhere near winning this byelection would be the most sensational result.\" If the vote share changes since last May's election were repeated across Scotland next time, the SNP would become the largest party in the Edinburgh assembly. Full results March 2000: Conservative: 12,580 SNP 9,236 Labour 7,054 Scottish Socialist party: 1,345 Liberal Democrats: 800 May 1999: Labour: 14,263 Conservative: 14238 SNP: 7291 Liberal Democrats: 1662 May 1997: Labour: 21,679 Conservative: 15,136 SNP 5,625 Liberal Democrats: 2,116",

On the menu: ras el hanout What is it? The grocer's head. Pardon? Sorry. The Middle Eastern equivalent to India's many masalas or the Chinese five-spice powder. A blend of spices used to add zip and zap to tagines and what have you. Which spices? Each grocer in North Africa has his own personal blend. Of? Legend has it, up to a hundred spices. In reality it's usually about 12. And they are? Cinnamon, nutmeg, dried rosebuds, ginger, cloves, cubebs, different peppers, and, if you're lucky, Spanish fly, which, it is said, has aphrodisiac properties. Ah, love my ras el hanout, love me. Something like that. The taste test: canned tuna in oil Where would we be without it? Tuna and sweetcorn for the baked potato. Tuna and mayo for sandwiches. Tuna for salade ni\u00e7oise (forget this faddish nonsense of making it with fresh tuna). The best is Spanish and taken from the belly of the fish. I would guess the supermarket versions are neither of these. All in sunflower oil unless specified. Sainsbury's 53p/200g. * * * * * Titular tuna; light, bright, clean flavour. Waitrose 79p/200g. * * * * * Ton-up tuna; paler, sweeter, and nicely rounded. Marks &amp; Spencer 75p/198g. * * * * Tasty tuna; firm, fruity, brisk and bouncy. Budgens in olive oil 75p/185g. * * * Tenderfoot tuna; shards rather than hunks, but lightweight oil suits it. Co-op 49p/185g. * * * Tactical tuna; good for sandwiches. Tesco Albacore 99p/198g. * * Technically tuna, just; flavour drowned by heavyweight oil.",

      "body": "<p>The ruthless behaviour of BMW has served as a rude awakening to the ultra-Blairite Stephen Byers, who has often displayed a wide-eyed admiration for big business since taking over as trade and industry secretary.</p> <p>In the past 48 hours, Mr Byers has suffered the humiliation of being caught off guard when rumours first surfaced in Germany that Rover was in danger of being broken up.</p> <p>As speculation intensified throughout yesterday morning, Mr Byers was forced to tell the weekly cabinet meeting that he had no idea about BMW's precise intentions. Hours later BMW made its announcement, showing that Mr Byers had as little insight into the company's plans as thousands of distraught Rover workers at Longbridge.</p> <p>The Tories wasted little time in seizing on his difficulties yesterday. Angela Browning, the shadow trade and industry secretary, told an emergency Commons debate that Mr Byers was so disorganised he \"could not even run a whelk stall\".</p> <p>Mr Byers' supporters argued last night that any trade and industry secretary would been placed in his position. \"This is all about factional fighting among BMW board members,\" one of his friends said. \"The anti-Rover group, which was in the minority, has triumphed in the past week.\"</p> <p>However, the Rover crisis will weaken the position of Mr Byers who has recently endured a series of embarrassing setbacks.</p> <p>Earlier this month, his department appeared to be in disarray when he dropped the telecommunications and water industries from his utilities bill. The u-turn was forced on Mr Byers by Downing Street which had come under pressure from the industries' regulators.</p> <p>The cross-party Commons trade and industry committee underlined its impatience with Mr Byers last month by reprimanding him for what it called his \"regrettable habit\" of repeating announcements and dressing up press notices with potentially misleading figures.</p> <p>Mr Byers's highly publicised \"Rip-off Britain\" campaign also rebounded in spectacular fashion. Reports, which were commissioned amid hype that consumers were paying more in Britain than on the continent, found that price levels were the same.</p> <p>Mr Byers's appointment to the DTI in December 1998, in the wake of Peter Mandelson's resignation over his home loan, was hailed as the promotion of another moderniser who would carry on the reforming work of his predecessor.</p> <p>However, Labour critics believe that Mr Byers has left himself short of friends by making the mistake of seeking to \"out-Blair the prime minister\" in his admiration for large corporations.</p> <p>But as Mr Byers ponders his future, there is at least one crumb of comfort. Mr Byers has been pressing Downing Street to step up its efforts to join the euro, an argument which is strengthened by BMW's claim that its hand has been forced by the strength of the pound.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The ruthless behaviour of BMW has served as a rude awakening to the ultra-Blairite Stephen Byers, who has often displayed a wide-eyed admiration for big business since taking over as trade and industry secretary. In the past 48 hours, Mr Byers has suffered the humiliation of being caught off guard when rumours first surfaced in Germany that Rover was in danger of being broken up. As speculation intensified throughout yesterday morning, Mr Byers was forced to tell the weekly cabinet meeting that he had no idea about BMW's precise intentions. Hours later BMW made its announcement, showing that Mr Byers had as little insight into the company's plans as thousands of distraught Rover workers at Longbridge. The Tories wasted little time in seizing on his difficulties yesterday. Angela Browning, the shadow trade and industry secretary, told an emergency Commons debate that Mr Byers was so disorganised he \"could not even run a whelk stall\". Mr Byers' supporters argued last night that any trade and industry secretary would been placed in his position. \"This is all about factional fighting among BMW board members,\" one of his friends said. \"The anti-Rover group, which was in the minority, has triumphed in the past week.\" However, the Rover crisis will weaken the position of Mr Byers who has recently endured a series of embarrassing setbacks. Earlier this month, his department appeared to be in disarray when he dropped the telecommunications and water industries from his utilities bill. The u-turn was forced on Mr Byers by Downing Street which had come under pressure from the industries' regulators. The cross-party Commons trade and industry committee underlined its impatience with Mr Byers last month by reprimanding him for what it called his \"regrettable habit\" of repeating announcements and dressing up press notices with potentially misleading figures. Mr Byers's highly publicised \"Rip-off Britain\" campaign also rebounded in spectacular fashion. Reports, which were commissioned amid hype that consumers were paying more in Britain than on the continent, found that price levels were the same. Mr Byers's appointment to the DTI in December 1998, in the wake of Peter Mandelson's resignation over his home loan, was hailed as the promotion of another moderniser who would carry on the reforming work of his predecessor. However, Labour critics believe that Mr Byers has left himself short of friends by making the mistake of seeking to \"out-Blair the prime minister\" in his admiration for large corporations. But as Mr Byers ponders his future, there is at least one crumb of comfort. Mr Byers has been pressing Downing Street to step up its efforts to join the euro, an argument which is strengthened by BMW's claim that its hand has been forced by the strength of the pound.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Mike Leigh</strong><br> Hiya folks, Mike Leigh here ready to answer your questions.</p> <p><strong>SKDavies2</strong><br> Dear Mike. Congratulations on the Oscar nomination. Will you be attending the ceremony, and who do you think deserves awards this year?</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> Thanks, SK. Got to go to the ceremony, it's non-negotiable. I mean, let's face it, if we didn't go and we won, it'd be embarrassing. I've no idea who I think deserves awards this year. I love Being John Malkovich, and Richard Farnsworth in The Straight Story is absolutely great, and I hope he wins Best Actor.</p> <p><strong>filmfan 101</strong><br> Peter Bradshaw wrote in his Topsy Turvy review: \"It is possible to spend two hours and 40 minutes waiting for this film to start, and I couldn't help wondering if we really needed every bit of those long rehearsal scenes\". Has he just missed the point?</p> <p><strong>SpankTM</strong><br> Which of the Fleet Street film critics do you respect, or otherwise? Or don't you pay any attention to them?</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> Has Peter missed the point? I should say so. If he spent the film waiting for it to start and wondering if it was too long, then so far as I'm concerned it wouldn't have mattered if it was seven minutes or seven hours long, it's just not his type of film. His loss.</p> <p>No names, but the critics I respect (no, not just the ones who like my films!) are the honest ones: ie the ones without a daft or negative agenda.</p> <p><strong>ollyf2</strong><br> Do you ever get frustrated at being labelled an arthouse director, and would you prefer your films to be seen by wider audiences, seeing as they are accessible enough?</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> I HATE being called an arthouse director, and I don't think I am one. Glad you think my films are accessible - of course they are.</p> <p><strong>sirharry</strong><br> Do you think Marianne Jean-Baptiste was justified in complaining about racism in the British film industry a few years ago?</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> Marianne was indeed justified in the sense that she was very frustrated after the success of Secrets and Lies in not being offered decent parts. There are, as yet, not enough good parts for black actors in British film.</p> <p><strong>withnail20</strong><br> Where do you keep your awards? Pride of place on the mantelpiece, or are they just handy doorstops?</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> Not on my mantelpiece, or holding the door open. They're all on a shelf in my office in Soho - all, that is, except the Palme d'Or, which is actually made of gold and is locked away somewhere. I'm not telling you where (and it isn't in my house).</p> <p><strong>withnail 20</strong><br> How much of the Johnny character did David Thewlis bring to his character in Naked? Have there ever been problems with actors who couldn't get into your improvisational style of film-making?</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> David Thewlis is the only actor in the world who could have played Johnny. All the actors in all my films work with me to create the characters. Therefore their input is hugely important. Very seldom, hardly ever, have there been actors who couldn't hack my sort of work.</p> <p><strong>withnail20</strong><br> I thought that. In other films, Thewlis is at his best playing characters who are in some way like Johnny (eg Divorcing Jack), and not so good in roles that don't suit his style, eg Island of Dr. Moreau (bleuggh), and Restoration.</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> I hesitate to agree too easily with what you say. At least if it is true, it isn't because David is limited as an actor - more a reflection on the limitations of the roles he is given, and probably of the quality of the films in question. So far as I'm concerned, he is an extremely versatile and talented actor. But it is true that he hasn't been able to pull out all the stops in any other film to the level he was able to in Naked.</p> <p><strong>Luce28</strong><br> How do you feel when people accuse you of \"patronising\" the working classes. I am from a working-class background and occasionally I think you have been secretly filming my mother and her friends. People really aren't all \"good\" because they come from one background, just as they aren't all demons because they come from another, surely?</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> Thanks, Luce! Couldn't agree more. And it does make me very upset when people do talk this continual nonsense about patronising the working-class.</p> <p><strong>Turnedoutn</strong><br> Which story would you most like to tell?</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> The one about the dog walking past the abattoir.</p> <p><strong>Nubby</strong><br> You look a bit like Frank Dobson. As a well-known Londoner, who will you be voting for as Mayor of London?</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> Frank Dobson is indeed very beautiful, but I should think I'll vote for Ken Livingstone.</p> <p><strong>Naomi2</strong><br> Mike, I read in an interview that your films are particularly successful in France. Why do you think that is, and have you any plans to work over there? Also, are there any actors you would particularly like to work with? Why do you tend to use the same group of people?</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> Secrets and Lies was particularly and phenomenally successful in France because it was the Palme d'Or winner at Cannes in 1996, and Palme d'Or winners are like Cup Final winning footballers in France. No plans to work over there, though the dinners are good. And your other question: Lots of actors I'd like to work with. Not true I tend to use the same group of people. Some of them are the same (if you get on with somebody, you work with them again), but there are always loads of new ones. See Topsy Turvy. </p> <p><strong>EDShane</strong><br> Mr Leigh, I really enjoyed Topsy Turvy. Loved the script, especially Gilbert's rehearsal note-givings (which were very funny). What I've been wondering, though, is this: when Gilbert first announces that The Mikado's song will be cut, one lone voice - Miss Rosina Brandham - says what most of them are thinking: that it is not fair. The chorus (based on historical fact) subsequently revolt. What I would like to know is: was Miss Brandham really the first to voice everyone's feelings aloud to Gilbert or was that just invented for the script? If so, whose idea was it that she should be the first to speak out?</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> Rosina wasn't the first person to voice the company's opinion. Or at least, if she was, it's a coincidence because I made it up. Somebody had to speak at that moment and I thought it's be good if it was her as she was the senior actress. Pure invention. Sorry!</p> <p><strong>Datta</strong><br> How would you respond to the accusation that the characters in your films have a tendency to be a collection of tics and mannerisms rather than recognisable people? Why are the \"professional\" people in your films predominantly preposterous cartoons (I'm thinking primarily of the yuppies in Naked and Career Girls)?</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> Well, here we go again. It's a ridiculous and stupid accusation. So is the one about \"professional\" characters. Why don't the accusers pay attention and actually look at the films? And, for that matter, why don't they pay attention and look at the people in the street?</p> <p><strong>Datta</strong><br> Mike, I don't think that's a terribly useful answer, sorry. Why don't you try engaging with my question instead of becoming defensive? I have actually looked at the relevant films, and paid attention and looked people in the streets (and in the gutters, and in the city wine bars) and I don't think my questions are unwarranted. If a character in a Mike Leigh film wears a suit or drives a BMW, he won't be allowed anything approaching the degree of depth or complexity the other characters have: why is this uniformly the case? The thing about mannerisms and tics, I dunno, why don't you actually look at the films?</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> I'm sorry too. But the truth is, I will never give you a useful answer. I can't. You have a view of my work which simply doesn't make sense to me, and somehow doesn't seem fair. It certainly isn't sympathetic. I can't change you opinion. I'm not being defensive, though I guess I am being helpless. Frankly, this kind of discussion makes me very sad, and frustrated.</p> <p><strong>Prawsfour</strong><br> I think Datta is slightly missing the point about the BMW drivers. Whether you believe or not that Mr. Leigh is attempting to portray such characters one-dimensional or without depth is not necessarily that provocative a point to make, and your argument is a frankly sluggish and \"depthless\" approach to film and representation.</p> <p><strong>Withnail20</strong><br> I do have to agree with Datta regarding the yuppie character in Naked. He didn't have much depth, just seemed like a stereotype.</p> <p><strong>Datta</strong><br> Mike - in fact, I like a large number of your films a great deal. I merely sought to seek your opinion on what I (subjectively, of course) see as flaws in your work. I can't see how this is unfair, and if I felt your work was worthless I certainly wouldn't bring it up. It was certainly not my intention to cause you sadness or frustration, but rather to gain some insight as to why you do some things the way you do. Peace! Prawnsfour - to descend to your level for a moment: that's one of the stupidest and most meaningless things anybody's ever said to me.</p> <p><strong>Withnail20</strong><br> Does it bother you at all that almost all your early BBC work goes unseen by virtually everyone under 30? I've managed to uncover Nuts in May, Abigail's Party and Meantime on video but very little else of your BBC work is available.</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> Absolutely. What a shame the BBC sits on all those films lots of us made in the 70s. We'd love to persuade them to release them commercially, but then the BBC is a ridiculous organisation these days.</p> <p><strong>Withnail 20</strong><br> Don't mean to scare you here but they may not even be around anymore! The Beeb has a bad reputation for erasing great programmes. They wiped out half of Spike Milligan's career, for flip's sake!</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> Good point. I know what you mean. Actually, all my films are safely under lock and key in the laboratories, but you're absolutely right, and a half hour studio play I did in 1976 called Knock for Knock was indeed wiped by a crackpot committee because of a \"shortage of space\". Especially tragic as a) incredible and hilarious performance from Sam Kelly and b) experimental for the time, in that the entire play was done in one take (television studio take not one camera, that is). And because at that time video-taping had not yet really happened, there are no extant copies of Knock for Knock anywhere to my knowledge. Indeed, if anybody out there has one, I will pay very good money for it. Knock for Knock was screened on BBC TV in the Second City Firsts series in autumn 1976. But overall, beware of the BBC.</p> <p><strong>Hiskander</strong><br> Mike, I am an actor and a huge fan of your films. Thank-you for such a fantastic contribution to the film industry. What can I do to work with you? Let's meet!</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> Hello actor. If you want to work with me, then you have to pass 'The Actor's Intelligence Test'. Find out where I am and drop me a line.</p> <p><strong>Davek</strong><br> Mr. Leigh, I recently saw Meantime for the first time on FilmFour and funnily enough it reminded me very much of Gary Oldman's Nil BY Mouth. Given his comments about how Nil By Mouth was very much autobiographical (and clearly the same goes for his performance in Meantime), it made me wonder how much of you is in your films. Are there many autobiographical influences? And another question about Meantime. How old was Tim Roth when the film was made? He looks about 12!</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> Tim was, I think, 21 or 22 when we made Meantime. All my films are autobiographical in one way or another, though never really in the direct autobiographical sense that Nil By Mouth is for Gary - it was a dramatisation of his family experiences. For me, all kinds of experience, of people and relationships and atmospheres and moods and conflicts and good moments and bad moments and places and all kinds of stuff find their way out of my subconscious and into my films.</p> <p><strong>Mnorth</strong><br> If you had to pick just one of your films to be judged on, which one would it be? From what you've said in the past, I have the sense that Naked is the picture you're most proud of.</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> I don't know what I've said in the past, but it isn't true about Naked. Actually, I find it impossible to nominate one of my films in preference to the others. I get very close to these films when I make them, they take up a huge part of my life and they're very personal films. So in a way they're like children: you can't say which is your favourite. Honest!</p> <p><strong>Withnail20</strong><br> Are there any you were a bit disappointed with, though? Career Girls got a pretty cool reception. I quite liked it, but it seemed pretty small-time next to Secrets and Lies.</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> I was very disappointed to the general reaction to Career Girls. I don't see it as \"small-time\" although it is, of course, a smaller canvas than, say, Naked or Secrets and Lies or indeed Topsy Turvy. But that should not be confused with the notion that it was small in its emotions or subject matter. Interestingly enough, since Career Girls came out, I have frequently been stopped by people in the street saying how much they liked it and were moved by it. And these have invariably been women of around 30 or under. When Topsy Turvy was reviewed a fortnight ago in the national press, a number of middle-aged male critics were rude about Career Girls. </p> <p><strong>Neil0123</strong><br> Do you ever suffer from excessive interference in post-production and as each film is produced, do you gain more or less control?</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> I'm extremely lucky in having had absolute control over my films throughout my film-making career. I always have final cut. This means that in production, or indeed post-production, we are left to get on with it in a truly creative and proper way. Of course, there are times when other people - backers, etc - do make suggestions, and sometimes these are very useful. But for the most part, the freedom and the independence is a major element. All this is helped considerably by the extraordinary abilities of Simon Channing-Williams, who is my producer and who has a great capacity to protect the production from negative interference.</p> <p><strong>Horatio001</strong><br> Your famous constructive rehearsals seem to enable you to get performances from actors that no other directors come close to. Do you have any plans to tell the world your secret and write a book that explains the dynamic?</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> The secret recipe will go with me to my grave. Information as to the precise location of the cemetery will be posted here in due course. Please bring Wellingtons.</p> <p><strong>Horatio001</strong><br> Will you be taking the recipe to your grave, a) because revealing the artifice might diminish your films?, b) Because you also like to keep the actors in the dark, and if they knew the recipe it might not work? Or c) Because you're a selfish bastard and you can't be bothered to write a book. And What colour Wellingtons would you prefer?</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> Rumbled! I am indeed a selfish bastard, and I'd rather stay in bed all day with a ----- than write a book such as you want.</p> <p><strong>EDShane</strong><br> Mike, I was reading a book on the history of the Unity Theatre and noticed how you were involved with a group called Dramograph. This prompts three questions: <br>How did you get involved with them?<br>Why did Dramograph allegedly (according to the book) not pay for hiring the Goldington Street Theatre? <br>Has your experience of the Dramograph group ever had any experience on your films?</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> Dramograph was formed by me and David Halliwell specifically and exclusively to stage the original production of his play Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunochs in March 1965. He played Malcolm Scrawdyke (which Ewan McGregor did again recently), and I directed and designed the production. I would love to be able to claim that I was properly involved in the Unity Theatre, which was a great socialist movement, but the truth is that we simply hired the theatre for the Dramograph production. The show was a total flop - very good reviews but nobody came to see it, and the reason we took a long time to pay for the hire is because we didn't have any dosh.</p> <p><strong>Luce28</strong><br> Mike, do you see your films as pure entertainment, or do you see them as being social commentary? The reason I ask is that I think some people get films (as an art form) mixed up with documentaries and make assumptions about \"messages\" that may or may not be there. I would guess that nine times out of ten the assumption is incorrect. Just how irritating is it when someone misses the point of a film you have made?</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> If a film isn't entertaining, it's a turkey. I hope mine are entertaining. However, for a film to be truly entertaining - that is, really interesting - it has to be about things that the audience can relate to or care about. So it seems natural to tell stories about real life and the way we live it. I agree that some people confuse the notion with the concept of documentaries. I don't make documentaries, although there is a level at which I try in my films to aspire to the condition of documentary - that is, to make you feel you are watching something that really is as real as a documentary.</p> <p><strong>Davek</strong><br> It occurs to me that Kathy Burke has never been in any of your films. Is she someone you would like to work with? I consider her to be as talented as people like Alison Steadman or Brenda Blethyn.</p> <p><strong>ML</strong><br> I have worked with Kathy Burke. She played the main character, Nell, in It's a Great Big Shame!, which was my last stage production, done at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, in 1993. She is one of my favourite actresses, although it is of course a total coincidence that I was on the jury at Cannes in 1997 when she was awarded Best Actress for her role in Nil By Mouth! </p> <p>That's all folks. Sorry, I've got to go and talk to a man regarding a dog walking past an abattoir. (And the boys will be round later, Datta.)</p> <p><strong>Datta</strong><br> I won't be answering the door to any hired goons tonight then.</p> <p><strong>Unanswered stragglers</strong> </p> <p><strong>Alison1234</strong><br> What comes after Topsy Turvy?</p> <p><strong>AndyMoore</strong><br> Are you able to offer advice on what to do with a 60-minute drama shot on Super-16 by a first time director that no festival seems to be interested in (due to its length, I suppose)? Seems a bit of a waste otherwise. An honest appraisal of it being that it's good, but not amazing. Yours wonderingly.</p> <p><strong>Ollyf2</strong><br> He's gone.</p> <p><strong>SpankTM</strong><br> Ladies and gentleman, Mike Leigh has left the building. Thanks for a very enjoyable hour, Mike.</p> <p><strong>Afterwords</strong> </p> <p><strong>Nac1</strong><br> I like Mike Leigh's films, but I've come across very few directors who take criticism so hard. I was at the NFT interview in November and noticed how quickly he got angry, rounding on a few of his interrogators as if they were imbeciles (perhaps they were - but most creative people in the public eye have more tolerance for dumb questions). I think Naked is THE best British film of the last decade and one of the top ten worldwide, but the caricaturing of certain types is a weakness in that and other films.</p> <p><strong>Datta</strong><br> I've re-read the thread, and I think I was out of order a couple of times (and I would have been less aggressive face-to-face). But I didn't expect Mike Leigh to treat my valid and pertinent questions as if they were the Tourettes outbursts of a trained attack-prostitute.</p> <p><strong>Withnail20</strong><br> Yeah. Seemed like a jolly nice chap but a bit over-sensitive to criticism.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mike Leigh Hiya folks, Mike Leigh here ready to answer your questions. SKDavies2 Dear Mike. Congratulations on the Oscar nomination. Will you be attending the ceremony, and who do you think deserves awards this year? ML Thanks, SK. Got to go to the ceremony, it's non-negotiable. I mean, let's face it, if we didn't go and we won, it'd be embarrassing. I've no idea who I think deserves awards this year. I love Being John Malkovich, and Richard Farnsworth in The Straight Story is absolutely great, and I hope he wins Best Actor. filmfan 101 Peter Bradshaw wrote in his Topsy Turvy review: \"It is possible to spend two hours and 40 minutes waiting for this film to start, and I couldn't help wondering if we really needed every bit of those long rehearsal scenes\". Has he just missed the point? SpankTM Which of the Fleet Street film critics do you respect, or otherwise? Or don't you pay any attention to them? ML Has Peter missed the point? I should say so. If he spent the film waiting for it to start and wondering if it was too long, then so far as I'm concerned it wouldn't have mattered if it was seven minutes or seven hours long, it's just not his type of film. His loss. No names, but the critics I respect (no, not just the ones who like my films!) are the honest ones: ie the ones without a daft or negative agenda. ollyf2 Do you ever get frustrated at being labelled an arthouse director, and would you prefer your films to be seen by wider audiences, seeing as they are accessible enough? ML I HATE being called an arthouse director, and I don't think I am one. Glad you think my films are accessible - of course they are. sirharry Do you think Marianne Jean-Baptiste was justified in complaining about racism in the British film industry a few years ago? ML Marianne was indeed justified in the sense that she was very frustrated after the success of Secrets and Lies in not being offered decent parts. There are, as yet, not enough good parts for black actors in British film. withnail20 Where do you keep your awards? Pride of place on the mantelpiece, or are they just handy doorstops? ML Not on my mantelpiece, or holding the door open. They're all on a shelf in my office in Soho - all, that is, except the Palme d'Or, which is actually made of gold and is locked away somewhere. I'm not telling you where (and it isn't in my house). withnail 20 How much of the Johnny character did David Thewlis bring to his character in Naked? Have there ever been problems with actors who couldn't get into your improvisational style of film-making? ML David Thewlis is the only actor in the world who could have played Johnny. All the actors in all my films work with me to create the characters. Therefore their input is hugely important. Very seldom, hardly ever, have there been actors who couldn't hack my sort of work. withnail20 I thought that. In other films, Thewlis is at his best playing characters who are in some way like Johnny (eg Divorcing Jack), and not so good in roles that don't suit his style, eg Island of Dr. Moreau (bleuggh), and Restoration. ML I hesitate to agree too easily with what you say. At least if it is true, it isn't because David is limited as an actor - more a reflection on the limitations of the roles he is given, and probably of the quality of the films in question. So far as I'm concerned, he is an extremely versatile and talented actor. But it is true that he hasn't been able to pull out all the stops in any other film to the level he was able to in Naked. Luce28 How do you feel when people accuse you of \"patronising\" the working classes. I am from a working-class background and occasionally I think you have been secretly filming my mother and her friends. People really aren't all \"good\" because they come from one background, just as they aren't all demons because they come from another, surely? ML Thanks, Luce! Couldn't agree more. And it does make me very upset when people do talk this continual nonsense about patronising the working-class. Turnedoutn Which story would you most like to tell? ML The one about the dog walking past the abattoir. Nubby You look a bit like Frank Dobson. As a well-known Londoner, who will you be voting for as Mayor of London? ML Frank Dobson is indeed very beautiful, but I should think I'll vote for Ken Livingstone. Naomi2 Mike, I read in an interview that your films are particularly successful in France. Why do you think that is, and have you any plans to work over there? Also, are there any actors you would particularly like to work with? Why do you tend to use the same group of people? ML Secrets and Lies was particularly and phenomenally successful in France because it was the Palme d'Or winner at Cannes in 1996, and Palme d'Or winners are like Cup Final winning footballers in France. No plans to work over there, though the dinners are good. And your other question: Lots of actors I'd like to work with. Not true I tend to use the same group of people. Some of them are the same (if you get on with somebody, you work with them again), but there are always loads of new ones. See Topsy Turvy. EDShane Mr Leigh, I really enjoyed Topsy Turvy. Loved the script, especially Gilbert's rehearsal note-givings (which were very funny). What I've been wondering, though, is this: when Gilbert first announces that The Mikado's song will be cut, one lone voice - Miss Rosina Brandham - says what most of them are thinking: that it is not fair. The chorus (based on historical fact) subsequently revolt. What I would like to know is: was Miss Brandham really the first to voice everyone's feelings aloud to Gilbert or was that just invented for the script? If so, whose idea was it that she should be the first to speak out? ML Rosina wasn't the first person to voice the company's opinion. Or at least, if she was, it's a coincidence because I made it up. Somebody had to speak at that moment and I thought it's be good if it was her as she was the senior actress. Pure invention. Sorry! Datta How would you respond to the accusation that the characters in your films have a tendency to be a collection of tics and mannerisms rather than recognisable people? Why are the \"professional\" people in your films predominantly preposterous cartoons (I'm thinking primarily of the yuppies in Naked and Career Girls)? ML Well, here we go again. It's a ridiculous and stupid accusation. So is the one about \"professional\" characters. Why don't the accusers pay attention and actually look at the films? And, for that matter, why don't they pay attention and look at the people in the street? Datta Mike, I don't think that's a terribly useful answer, sorry. Why don't you try engaging with my question instead of becoming defensive? I have actually looked at the relevant films, and paid attention and looked people in the streets (and in the gutters, and in the city wine bars) and I don't think my questions are unwarranted. If a character in a Mike Leigh film wears a suit or drives a BMW, he won't be allowed anything approaching the degree of depth or complexity the other characters have: why is this uniformly the case? The thing about mannerisms and tics, I dunno, why don't you actually look at the films? ML I'm sorry too. But the truth is, I will never give you a useful answer. I can't. You have a view of my work which simply doesn't make sense to me, and somehow doesn't seem fair. It certainly isn't sympathetic. I can't change you opinion. I'm not being defensive, though I guess I am being helpless. Frankly, this kind of discussion makes me very sad, and frustrated. Prawsfour I think Datta is slightly missing the point about the BMW drivers.

Thus Labour made cutting the number of poor children a central objective of its first term. </p> <p>In 1997/8 more than 3m children were living below half the mean income level. That is one in four children and it is three times more than in 1979. In its first year New Labour did little to tackle the problem. Since then Gordon Brown has given it priority. First there was an attempt to alter income levels directly through tax and benefits. The aim: to give extra to those who need it most, through working families tax credit (WFTC), higher child benefit and child tax credit. </p> <p>Second, Labour's New Deal promoted paid work, giving parents help and incentives to find it. Paid work is seen as the best long-term route to financial independence. The third focus has been to tackle long-term disadvantage, for example by reducing teenage pregnancy. </p> <p>We found that the combined effect of changes in tax and benefit since 1997 (including the minimum wage) has been to increase incomes of the poorest more than those of the better-off and of households with children more than others. Nine out of 10 children are living in households where income has gone up compared with one in 10 who are worse off. </p> <p>Overall the household income of the poorest fifth of children has increased by more than 8%. By 2002 the proportion of children in poverty (defining that as below 50% of mean income before housing costs) will fall by 6 percentage points. That is 840,000 children: 540,000 in two-parent and 300,000 in one-parent families. </p> <p>The government is focusing on increasing the number of families (with children) who have paid work. At maximum, this could cut poverty dramatically - double the reduction achieved thanks to changes in taxes and benefits and the minimum wage alone. This strategy requires work to be made more financially attractive. But for many the gains from earning are modest and the impact of Labour's policies is not uniformly positive. Lone parents now returning to work and earning around \u00a3100 a week are certainly better off in work than not. But the increase in their income would be less than it would have been under the policy Labour inherited from the Tories in 1997. This result stems from the effects of abolishing lone parent benefit and interactions between WFTC and benefits. </p> <p>Finding paid work for all families with school-age children would involve a major expansion of employment by 1.5m. Actual prospects for growth in the number of parents with paid work are uncertain. If, say, an additional 250,000 found jobs, this would reduce the number of children living in poverty by about 160,000. Labour would then have succeeded in cutting the child poverty total by 1m - one third of the number now. </p> <p>Mr Brown's approach has been to concentrate resources on the poor by means of greater selectivity and means-testing. But more support for the poorest, which is then rapidly withdrawn as they earn higher sums from work, serves to extend the poverty trap - even if its extremes are smoothed out. The danger arises of creating a two-class world. One is inhabited by poor families with no or low pay who receive large amounts of income support or WFTC. The other contains not-very-well-off families who receive little state support. If the condition of the poorest families is improved but not that of other families with below-average incomes, then the incentive to self-help will inevitably decline. Thus, while the New Labour approach emphasises responsibilities and emphasises the desirability of more self-reliance, its selective strategy may be undermining what it seeks to encourage. </p> <p>To make work pay more than it does now brings unpalatable but inescapable choices for the social security system. Income support levels for those not working might be cut in relative terms. This will happen over time if uprating is not in line with other incomes. This will of course add to child poverty. Alternatively, benefits to those in low paid work (such as WFTC) will be increased. If this is done only for those on very low earnings, the means-testing involved will exacerbate the poverty trap discouraging self-reliance; if higher benefits are spread to higher earnings levels, the cost to the exchequer will be greatly increased and can only be met by explicit redistributional tax policies. </p> <p>The promotion of paid work is not, however, only a matter of financial incentives. It also involves child care, transport and family-friendly employment. The difficulties and stress - impinging on both parents and children - that result from combining paid work and childcare will only be marginally affected by Labour's reforms thus far. </p> <p>Reducing child poverty by 1m will be a most significant achievement. But caution is necessary on several fronts. First, those raised out of poverty tend to be those closest to the poverty level. Second, for child poverty actually to fall by this amount depends on unemployment being kept down. Third, the extent of child poverty would remain extremely high by post-war British and European standards. Child poverty would still be twice as high as when Labour was last in office, as the chart shows. To abolish child poverty in a generation it will be necessary to accelerate change and achieve further transfers to families with children. </p> <p>Nevertheless, by focusing on the income and opportunities of the poorest, a start has been made. In next week's budget the chancellor has to raise benefits in line with the increase in incomes at large - anything else puts the gains for poor families in jeopardy.

He already had a reputation for taking companies with heavy losses or few prospects and turning them into money-spinners. In this respect, at least, he is unlike the medieval alchemists after which his business is named. They failed to find a way of turning base metals into gold. Mr Moulton claims to have created at least 200 millionaires during his career as a venture capitalist. He said yesterday that his first priority would be to cut costs as Rover - a move which will send a chill down the spine of the workforce which has already seen thousands of jobs axed over the last two years. \"We are are going to reduce the cost base to a level where the company generates cash rather than eats it.\" Alchemy had ample finan cial resources and, contrary to rumours, Volkswagen was not involved.

      "body": "<p>It's not just the sushi bars that have brought a taste of Tokyo to central London. Last week saw the first signs of \"PlayStation mania\", repeating scenes in Japan of video game fans queuing overnight to be first to buy Sony's next-generation console. </p> <p>But the crowd gathered last week was not in front of Sony's shop in Tottenham Court Road. It was around the corner, blocking the pavement in front of the smaller, less well-known Computer Exchange branch, which claimed to be first to sell PlayStation 2 to the British public. </p> <p>Using contacts built up over years of importing Japanese games and equipment, the company managed to dodge Sony's ban on export sales of the new console. Four days after the official Japanese launch, the chain was offering its first batch of PlayStation 2s on its website (<a href=\"http://www.cex.co.uk\" )>www.cex.co.uk)</a> and in nine stores for \u00a3999 - \u00a3700 more than Sony is expected to charge when it starts sales in this country in September. </p> <p>The new machine promises to be a big hit in the UK, judging by sales of the original PlayStation, which since launch six years ago has captured the lion's share of the \u00a31bn spent on computer games every year. But the updated PlayStation offers more than just games. It has a DVD drive, allowing it to double as a home movie player, and the addition of a modem allows connection to the internet. No wonder software group Microsoft has identified Sony and the PlayStation as a big threat to its PC empire. </p> <p>Even now what is at stake is Sony's grip on the UK's computer games market, a huge leisure industry; cinema attendances bring in a mere \u00a3570m, according to Screen Digest. The UK is by far the largest market for video games in Europe - twice as big as nearest rival France - with more than one in five households already owning a PlayStation console. </p> <p>By the end of last year, 16.5m had been sold in Europe, 5m of them in the UK. </p> <p>\"It's a maturing market - it's not just kids any more,\" said Ciaran Barr, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank in London. \"The computer games market is going to continue to have growth rates well above the rest of the UK retail sector - especially when it goes online.\" Mr Barr owns a PlayStation, as well as its Sega and Nintendo rivals. So will he be buying the new PlayStation? \"I certainly will.\" </p> <p>Mark Lewis, Computer Exchange's director of controls, is cagey about how many PSX2s (as aficionados call the new console) his company has sold but suggests the figure is around 100, with more shipments from Japanese suppliers on the way. The company is coy about who is supplying the hardware from Japan because Sony has threatened retaliation against suppliers to the informal \"grey market\". </p> <p>Mr Lewis stresses that its imports are legal but adds: \"I think it's fair to say we're not much liked by Sony.\" He recalls gleefully that some of the crowd who came to see the new machine were from the Sony showroom around the corner. </p> <p>Guy Pearce, PR manager for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, said his company was resigned to grey market imports. He estimated as many as 10,000 consoles could be imported by the time official sales start. \"There will always be a hard core who will pay almost anything to get one.\" </p> <p>But not for long. At Computer Exchange the price has dropped already to \u00a3699.</p>",

Using contacts built up over years of importing Japanese games and equipment, the company managed to dodge Sony's ban on export sales of the new console. Four days after the official Japanese launch, the chain was offering its first batch of PlayStation 2s on its website (www.cex.co.uk) and in nine stores for \u00a3999 - \u00a3700 more than Sony is expected to charge when it starts sales in this country in September. The new machine promises to be a big hit in the UK, judging by sales of the original PlayStation, which since launch six years ago has captured the lion's share of the \u00a31bn spent on computer games every year. But the updated PlayStation offers more than just games. It has a DVD drive, allowing it to double as a home movie player, and the addition of a modem allows connection to the internet. No wonder software group Microsoft has identified Sony and the PlayStation as a big threat to its PC empire. Even now what is at stake is Sony's grip on the UK's computer games market, a huge leisure industry; cinema attendances bring in a mere \u00a3570m, according to Screen Digest. The UK is by far the largest market for video games in Europe - twice as big as nearest rival France - with more than one in five households already owning a PlayStation console. By the end of last year, 16.5m had been sold in Europe, 5m of them in the UK. \"It's a maturing market - it's not just kids any more,\" said Ciaran Barr, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank in London. \"The computer games market is going to continue to have growth rates well above the rest of the UK retail sector - especially when it goes online.\" Mr Barr owns a PlayStation, as well as its Sega and Nintendo rivals. So will he be buying the new PlayStation? \"I certainly will.\" Mark Lewis, Computer Exchange's director of controls, is cagey about how many PSX2s (as aficionados call the new console) his company has sold but suggests the figure is around 100, with more shipments from Japanese suppliers on the way. The company is coy about who is supplying the hardware from Japan because Sony has threatened retaliation against suppliers to the informal \"grey market\". Mr Lewis stresses that its imports are legal but adds: \"I think it's fair to say we're not much liked by Sony.\" He recalls gleefully that some of the crowd who came to see the new machine were from the Sony showroom around the corner. Guy Pearce, PR manager for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, said his company was resigned to grey market imports. He estimated as many as 10,000 consoles could be imported by the time official sales start. \"There will always be a hard core who will pay almost anything to get one.\" But not for long. At Computer Exchange the price has dropped already to \u00a3699.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Thank you, William Hague. At last he has contributed something useful to the bloodless politics of these times. His lecture on the morality of taxation flushed out the government, forcing it to admit that tax has indeed risen since 1997. Once it had been admitted, the government had to justify it - and be proud of it. High time, too. No more stealth taxes, no more slipping large backhanders to the poor while hoping the Daily Mail isn't looking. It means that at last Labour can start to boast about how much money has gone to the pockets of the poor - this government's honourable first spending priority when it came to power, ahead of more popular and visible spending on schools and hospitals.</p> <p>As a piece of elegant sophistry William Hague's speech is a masterpiece of the genre. Its daring humbug takes the breath away - Uriah Heep meets Ebeneezer Scrooge. \"High taxes mean less freedom, less responsibility, less community, more dependency, a less elevated human condition,\" he said. Preposterously, he claimed high taxes stop people spending their money on training, saving, books for children and care for elderly parents. Nothing here about the boom in bars, restaurants, holidays, designer clothes and the whole mighty whoosh of consumerism among Britain's under-taxed high spenders.</p> <p>The moral tax-cut comes, like many British political ideas, from across the Atlantic where last week I heard George W Bush define \"compassionate conservatism\" thus: \"It is conservative to cut taxes, it is compassionate to give people their money back.\" It was obvious that Hague would rush to imitate Bush's great anti-tax campaign with its huge bribe to the voters ($2,000 a head minimum, much more for the rich). Hague reiterated his impossible \"tax guarantee\" pledge to cut the overall burden come what may. Toying with the idea that charity might replace welfare, he claimed that people would give more to charity if they paid less tax - notoriously not the case in the selfish spirit of Thatcher's 80s when giving dropped like a stone. \"We will make tax a key battleground of the next election,\" he promised. \"We must show that it is our Conservative low-tax agenda that is not just the basis of a dynamic economy but also the foundation of a moral, compassionate, free and just society.\"</p> <p>Into this battleground steps the chancellor on Tuesday. The question this time will not only be \"What's in the budget?\" but also \"What does he want people to think is in his budget?\" Politically the message will matter almost as much as the money. It is not just Labour's grumbling heartlands that must be appeased, but the great concerned majority who may uneasily agree with William Hague's (self-defeating) observation that \"public services are not getting any better. The NHS is locked in permanent crisis. Police numbers are falling and crime is rising. Our roads are gridlocked\". In other words people do make the link between paying higher taxes and getting better services. If they are constantly told that taxes are not going up, they may be inclined to think the government isn't doing enough to mend the devastation in public services left by 20 years of underfunding - and they would be right. They may suspect that if it isn't hurting their own pockets, it probably isn't working. You get what you pay for. So the symbolism of the penny cut in income tax may may perversely work against the chancellor and not for him after all. Now suffering the backwash of his two-year spending freeze, many Labour MPs wonder if it was really necessary to get elected? We shall never know, but the price has been high.</p> <p>Budgets are not what they were now that treasury getting and spending is separated. Only the July spending review will reveal how much is to be spent over the next three years on all the pressing needs around us. We do know Gordon Brown has a pile of money to spend - some \u00a310bn - without raising any extra tax. Is it enough? There will be a steady increase for schools and hospitals - higher growth than ever before, but not quite a spending revolution. (Can it hit Blair's NHS promise to meet the EU average?) For when it comes to public spending there is no \"enough\". For example, imagine replacing every dismal, uninviting school with gleaming state-of-the-art buildings filled with unstressed, well-paid, state-of-the-art teachers, enjoyable places not just for children but enticing local people in to use computers, swimming pools, gyms, evening classes, art rooms, cafes and theatres for pleasing leisure. It's not an impossible dream. But only higher taxes could see such a progressive leap in public facilities. So the question is not how far Gordon Brown's existing war chest will go but whether he dare raise tax to the maximum? That is whatever the economy and employment can bear, whatever voters will wear once they see what the money can buy. High taxes well-spent are virtuous, but the case for taxation would have to be made boldly.</p> <p>It's time to counter the Tory \"stealth tax\" charge by exposing the \"stealth welfare state\" of the rich. Start with national insurance where the rich still don't pay their fair share. There is a ceiling which means the low paid pay a higher proportion than top earners. Taking the lid off would bring in another \u00a34.5bn a year. The self-employed pay virtually no national insurance and that includes some of the very highest earners, such as partners in big law and accountancy firms who deem themselves to be self-employed. Taking that away would bring in about \u00a32bn more a year. Inheritance tax is now almost non-existent. It only kicks in on estates worth over \u00a3233,000 and most of the rich hand over their money before they die to avoid death duties. The Fabian tax commission is considering a good inheritance reform that would bring in billions. Restricting the personal allowance to the basic tax rate would bring in another \u00a32bn from top earners. Another \u00a31bn a year can be collected from country land-owners who sell their acres to developers but pay no capital gains tax if they roll over the money to buy more land. The valuable signature of a local planning officer lets them make millions without paying any tax at all. All these are stealthy ways the rich pay too little tax. Does it make them more moral than everyone else?</p> <p>Taxation is fiscally virtuous because it allows spending without inflating the economy. Taxation is a far better way to damp down over-heating than by constantly pushing up interest rates, which helps to keep the pound far too high for industry. Taxation is virtuous because when well spent it can buy everyone far more of the things conducive to contentment than they can ever buy from their own pocket. If William Hague is going to run on a \"selfishness pays\" platform, Labour will have to show how it doesn't. It is not necessarily a moral issue but one of enlightened self-interest. No doubt the chancellor will please many on Tuesday - he always does. But a paean of praise for tax would be a new defining moment for Labour, courtesy of Mr Hague.</p>",

It means that at last Labour can start to boast about how much money has gone to the pockets of the poor - this government's honourable first spending priority when it came to power, ahead of more popular and visible spending on schools and hospitals. As a piece of elegant sophistry William Hague's speech is a masterpiece of the genre. Its daring humbug takes the breath away - Uriah Heep meets Ebeneezer Scrooge. \"High taxes mean less freedom, less responsibility, less community, more dependency, a less elevated human condition,\" he said. Preposterously, he claimed high taxes stop people spending their money on training, saving, books for children and care for elderly parents. Nothing here about the boom in bars, restaurants, holidays, designer clothes and the whole mighty whoosh of consumerism among Britain's under-taxed high spenders. The moral tax-cut comes, like many British political ideas, from across the Atlantic where last week I heard George W Bush define \"compassionate conservatism\" thus: \"It is conservative to cut taxes, it is compassionate to give people their money back.\" It was obvious that Hague would rush to imitate Bush's great anti-tax campaign with its huge bribe to the voters ($2,000 a head minimum, much more for the rich). Hague reiterated his impossible \"tax guarantee\" pledge to cut the overall burden come what may. Toying with the idea that charity might replace welfare, he claimed that people would give more to charity if they paid less tax - notoriously not the case in the selfish spirit of Thatcher's 80s when giving dropped like a stone. \"We will make tax a key battleground of the next election,\" he promised. \"We must show that it is our Conservative low-tax agenda that is not just the basis of a dynamic economy but also the foundation of a moral, compassionate, free and just society.\" Into this battleground steps the chancellor on Tuesday. The question this time will not only be \"What's in the budget?\" but also \"What does he want people to think is in his budget?\" Politically the message will matter almost as much as the money. It is not just Labour's grumbling heartlands that must be appeased, but the great concerned majority who may uneasily agree with William Hague's (self-defeating) observation that \"public services are not getting any better. The NHS is locked in permanent crisis. Police numbers are falling and crime is rising. Our roads are gridlocked\". In other words people do make the link between paying higher taxes and getting better services. If they are constantly told that taxes are not going up, they may be inclined to think the government isn't doing enough to mend the devastation in public services left by 20 years of underfunding - and they would be right. They may suspect that if it isn't hurting their own pockets, it probably isn't working. You get what you pay for. So the symbolism of the penny cut in income tax may may perversely work against the chancellor and not for him after all. Now suffering the backwash of his two-year spending freeze, many Labour MPs wonder if it was really necessary to get elected? We shall never know, but the price has been high. Budgets are not what they were now that treasury getting and spending is separated. Only the July spending review will reveal how much is to be spent over the next three years on all the pressing needs around us. We do know Gordon Brown has a pile of money to spend - some \u00a310bn - without raising any extra tax. Is it enough? There will be a steady increase for schools and hospitals - higher growth than ever before, but not quite a spending revolution. (Can it hit Blair's NHS promise to meet the EU average?) For when it comes to public spending there is no \"enough\". For example, imagine replacing every dismal, uninviting school with gleaming state-of-the-art buildings filled with unstressed, well-paid, state-of-the-art teachers, enjoyable places not just for children but enticing local people in to use computers, swimming pools, gyms, evening classes, art rooms, cafes and theatres for pleasing leisure. It's not an impossible dream. But only higher taxes could see such a progressive leap in public facilities. So the question is not how far Gordon Brown's existing war chest will go but whether he dare raise tax to the maximum? That is whatever the economy and employment can bear, whatever voters will wear once they see what the money can buy. High taxes well-spent are virtuous, but the case for taxation would have to be made boldly. It's time to counter the Tory \"stealth tax\" charge by exposing the \"stealth welfare state\" of the rich. Start with national insurance where the rich still don't pay their fair share. There is a ceiling which means the low paid pay a higher proportion than top earners. Taking the lid off would bring in another \u00a34.5bn a year. The self-employed pay virtually no national insurance and that includes some of the very highest earners, such as partners in big law and accountancy firms who deem themselves to be self-employed. Taking that away would bring in about \u00a32bn more a year. Inheritance tax is now almost non-existent. It only kicks in on estates worth over \u00a3233,000 and most of the rich hand over their money before they die to avoid death duties. The Fabian tax commission is considering a good inheritance reform that would bring in billions. Restricting the personal allowance to the basic tax rate would bring in another \u00a32bn from top earners. Another \u00a31bn a year can be collected from country land-owners who sell their acres to developers but pay no capital gains tax if they roll over the money to buy more land. The valuable signature of a local planning officer lets them make millions without paying any tax at all. All these are stealthy ways the rich pay too little tax. Does it make them more moral than everyone else? Taxation is fiscally virtuous because it allows spending without inflating the economy. Taxation is a far better way to damp down over-heating than by constantly pushing up interest rates, which helps to keep the pound far too high for industry. Taxation is virtuous because when well spent it can buy everyone far more of the things conducive to contentment than they can ever buy from their own pocket. If William Hague is going to run on a \"selfishness pays\" platform, Labour will have to show how it doesn't. It is not necessarily a moral issue but one of enlightened self-interest. No doubt the chancellor will please many on Tuesday - he always does. But a paean of praise for tax would be a new defining moment for Labour, courtesy of Mr Hague.",

At least 16 more cases are ready to be filed against the former prime minister, said Mr Khan. \"This is one of the Sharif cases,\" he said, his hand resting on a two-inch thick green file. \"There is so much work involved. We are not taking any chances. \"In the past there were a lot of allegations that prosecutions were politically motivated. We have made it a basic policy that none of our prosecutions are going to be politically motivated,\" he said. Benazir Bhutto, a former prime minister living in London, is a \"proclaimed offender\". She and her husband were convicted in April last year of taking kickbacks from a Swiss firm and were sentenced to five years in jail, fined $8.6m and banned from politics for seven years. Mr Khan is waiting for a Swiss court to unlock some of the money involved in the case. \"We have got a lot of money expected from the proceedings in Switzerland,\" he said. \"I don't want the embarrassment of her back here and creating a martyr out of her. But where her assets were acquired through illegal means they should be returned to Pakistan. And I will get them.\" Mr Khan is working in a country steeped in corruption. A small group among the elite has combined outstanding loans of an estimated 211bn rupees, a third of the national budget. Then there are the kickbacks, tax evasion, embezzlement and money laundering. \"By the time we're through we are going to try our utmost to eradicate the culture of massive corruption,\" said Mr Khan. His young team of investigators has risen from a paltry 15 to more than 100, still barely enough to handle the workload. \"I'm not talking about a police inspector taking 100 rupees. I'm talking about massive corruption, the millions and the billions,\" he said. Others have promised as much in the past and not delivered. But this time the military has staked its legitimacy on the work being done by Mr Khan in his red-brick tower.",

Military spokesmen said yesterday that nine suspects were detained.</p> <p>The raids reflect increasing western concern about groups of hardline ethnic Albanians who have crossed into Serbia and provided Yugoslav forces with a pretext to harass and intimidate the local population of the Presevo valley area, which contains at least 60,000 ethnic Albanians.</p> <p>About 6,000 ethnic Albanians have fled the Presevo region since last June, including hundreds last week. Many seem as wary of the guerrillas as they do of the Serbian forces which are reportedly building up in the area.</p> <p>About 300 troops of the US 1st infantry division, serving with the Nato-led K-For international peacekeeping mission, used helicopters and armoured vehicles, in the swoop on Wednesday.

      "bodyText": "American troops in Kosovo raided hideouts along the boundary with southern Serbia, seizing arms and ammunition, in a crackdown against ethnic Albanian extremists. Military spokesmen said yesterday that nine suspects were detained. The raids reflect increasing western concern about groups of hardline ethnic Albanians who have crossed into Serbia and provided Yugoslav forces with a pretext to harass and intimidate the local population of the Presevo valley area, which contains at least 60,000 ethnic Albanians. About 6,000 ethnic Albanians have fled the Presevo region since last June, including hundreds last week. Many seem as wary of the guerrillas as they do of the Serbian forces which are reportedly building up in the area. About 300 troops of the US 1st infantry division, serving with the Nato-led K-For international peacekeeping mission, used helicopters and armoured vehicles, in the swoop on Wednesday. They seized more than 200 uniforms, 22 crates of rifle and machine gun ammunition, two mortars, 28 hand grenades, seven rifles, six land mines and other military supplies, a US statement said. The operation was part of a US \"interdiction strategy\" to prevent cross-boundary activity by insurgent groups from Kosovo, it said. The sites \"were being used as [caches] for weapons, ammunition and supplies\" for \"fringe or extremist elements in Kosovo, Macedonia or the Presevo valley\". \"The search operations will continue in these areas until they have been thoroughly cleared,\" the statement said. A K-For statement added: \"Any insurgent activity that endangers the progress achieved in Kosovo will not be tolerated.\" The raids were welcomed by the British government. Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, told MPs yesterday that Nato \"would not allow hardliners on either side to undermine the future of Kosovo\". Nato officials said the uniforms seized included black and red insignias of the \"Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac\", named after three predominantly ethnic Albanian towns across the boundary in southern Serbia. The guerrillas are reported to bear a striking resemblance to the now disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). Washington has warned leaders of the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo that it will not come to the aid of ethnic Albanians in the Presevo area across the boundary, should the Serbs retaliate for the guerrilla incursions. The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, yesterday accused ethnic Albanian extremists - former members of the KLA or members of the new group - of provocation and incursions in southern Serbia. \"It is clear that it is the Albanians who are now the cause of these provocations,\" he said in Paris, adding that he was discussing with various countries the need to send more police and troops to Kosovo. France is to deploy an additional 150 soldiers, while Italy is sending 360 more. President Bill Clinton and the French president, Jacques Chirac, have called for a ministerial meeting of the six-country Contact Group to discuss ethnic violence within Kosovo, particularly in the divided town of Mitrovice.",

But Mr Aziz, a longstanding member of President Saddam Hussein's government, was uncompromising about the UN resolution during an interview with the Guardian on Wednesday.</p> <p>\"This is not a solution. It goes nowhere. We would get back into a vicious circle. I would be an idiot to recommend it to the leader. I am not a fool,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Aziz called for Britain, which originally proposed the resolution, and the US to enter into direct dialogue with Iraq. Both have refused to do so.</p> <p>Iraq's position had appeared to be softening during the past two months, with the country's representative at the UN seemingly ready to compromise on the resolution. The US and British governments also took as a positive sign the fact that Iraq did not object to the appointment of Mr Blix.</p> <p>But the Iraqi government line has suddenly hardened. Mr Aziz expressed no confidence in Mr Blix, saying that he failed to stand up to the US and Britain when he worked for the previous weapons inspectors in Baghdad. \"We have decided to resist. We have no other choice,\" Mr Aziz said.</p> <p>The Iraqi government is confident that it can hold out because the mood of the international community towards sanctions is changing, with a growing number of western governments being subjected to public pressure over the harsh humanitarian consequences of the UN measures.</p> <p>Iraq's borders are becoming increasingly porous and several countries are re-establishing normal diplomatic ties. Mr Aziz was delighted by the extent of in-fighting within the security council that has left the US and Britain increasingly isolated in their handling of the Saddam regime.</p> <p>The Iraqi government does not expect any deal before next year. The Iraqi foreign minister, Mohamed Said Sahaf, in a separate interview, said: \"The UN is going to be prevented from taking any serious step until they see the result of the American election. Then we will reach the crossroads. At that juncture, the majority will be leaning towards a political solution. I believe the political solution will prevail.\"</p> <p>US and British intelligence sources say that while they are satisfied that Iraq no longer has nuclear weapons, it still has relatively small amounts of biological and chemical weapons, and possibly some missiles. The previous arms inspectors were withdrawn in 1998, claiming that Baghdad was failing to cooperate.</p> <p>Mr Aziz denied having any weapons of mass destruction. \"When you make allegations that Iraq is hiding biological weapons, you have no evidence,\" he said.</p> <p>\"A helicopter with the right equipment can trace any biological or chemical particles. It can cover tens of thousands of square miles, and they had such helicopters flying all over Iraq for years, but still they say that Saddam has biological weapons. Where is the evidence?\"</p> <p>His main complaint was that the UN resolution was so ambiguous that the new weapons inspectors would never be satisfied, and that Iraq would have the worst of both worlds: the sanctions still in place and the inspectors back in Baghdad. In such circumstances, he said, Iraq might as well continue to show as much ingenuity as possible to survive under the sanctions.</p> <p>He was confident that the sanctions would eventually be lifted. The Iraqi government might accept a compromise in which the sanctions were lifted simultaneously with the return of weapons inspectors to Baghdad. It would also insist that the inspectors' remit was tightly drawn.</p> <p>The Labour MP George Galloway yesterday delivered a truckload of medicine to the Red Crescent headquarters in Baghdad, in defiance of the British government and the UN sanctions committee's refusal to allow him to fly the \u00a3115,000 worth of supplies direct from London to Baghdad.</p> <p>Mr Galloway told the Red Crescent staff and government officials: \"We will not stop until this great crime [sanctions] is stopped and this great stain on the US and Britain is expunged.\"</p>",

The head of the new UN weapons inspectorate, Hans Blix, is putting together a team in New York and is expected to forward a detailed plan to Iraq next month. But Mr Aziz, a longstanding member of President Saddam Hussein's government, was uncompromising about the UN resolution during an interview with the Guardian on Wednesday. \"This is not a solution. It goes nowhere. We would get back into a vicious circle. I would be an idiot to recommend it to the leader. I am not a fool,\" he said. Mr Aziz called for Britain, which originally proposed the resolution, and the US to enter into direct dialogue with Iraq. Both have refused to do so. Iraq's position had appeared to be softening during the past two months, with the country's representative at the UN seemingly ready to compromise on the resolution. The US and British governments also took as a positive sign the fact that Iraq did not object to the appointment of Mr Blix. But the Iraqi government line has suddenly hardened. Mr Aziz expressed no confidence in Mr Blix, saying that he failed to stand up to the US and Britain when he worked for the previous weapons inspectors in Baghdad. \"We have decided to resist. We have no other choice,\" Mr Aziz said. The Iraqi government is confident that it can hold out because the mood of the international community towards sanctions is changing, with a growing number of western governments being subjected to public pressure over the harsh humanitarian consequences of the UN measures. Iraq's borders are becoming increasingly porous and several countries are re-establishing normal diplomatic ties. Mr Aziz was delighted by the extent of in-fighting within the security council that has left the US and Britain increasingly isolated in their handling of the Saddam regime. The Iraqi government does not expect any deal before next year. The Iraqi foreign minister, Mohamed Said Sahaf, in a separate interview, said: \"The UN is going to be prevented from taking any serious step until they see the result of the American election. Then we will reach the crossroads. At that juncture, the majority will be leaning towards a political solution. I believe the political solution will prevail.\" US and British intelligence sources say that while they are satisfied that Iraq no longer has nuclear weapons, it still has relatively small amounts of biological and chemical weapons, and possibly some missiles. The previous arms inspectors were withdrawn in 1998, claiming that Baghdad was failing to cooperate. Mr Aziz denied having any weapons of mass destruction. \"When you make allegations that Iraq is hiding biological weapons, you have no evidence,\" he said. \"A helicopter with the right equipment can trace any biological or chemical particles. It can cover tens of thousands of square miles, and they had such helicopters flying all over Iraq for years, but still they say that Saddam has biological weapons. Where is the evidence?\" His main complaint was that the UN resolution was so ambiguous that the new weapons inspectors would never be satisfied, and that Iraq would have the worst of both worlds: the sanctions still in place and the inspectors back in Baghdad. In such circumstances, he said, Iraq might as well continue to show as much ingenuity as possible to survive under the sanctions. He was confident that the sanctions would eventually be lifted. The Iraqi government might accept a compromise in which the sanctions were lifted simultaneously with the return of weapons inspectors to Baghdad. It would also insist that the inspectors' remit was tightly drawn. The Labour MP George Galloway yesterday delivered a truckload of medicine to the Red Crescent headquarters in Baghdad, in defiance of the British government and the UN sanctions committee's refusal to allow him to fly the \u00a3115,000 worth of supplies direct from London to Baghdad. Mr Galloway told the Red Crescent staff and government officials: \"We will not stop until this great crime [sanctions] is stopped and this great stain on the US and Britain is expunged.\"",

The House of Lords unanimously ruled that the couple, who can be named only as Mr and Mrs W, can claim compensation from Essex county council. The parents and children tried to sue the council and the social worker in the case after learning that the council knew when it placed the 15-year-old in their home that he had been cautioned by police for an indecent assault on his three-year-old sister and was being investigated for an alleged rape. The parents had stipulated when signing up to foster that they would not accept any child who was a known or suspected sex abuser. But the council cited earlier cases in which courts had ruled that local authorities could not be sued over the way they handled their child care duties. In 1997 a high court judge struck out the parents' claims but allowed the children's to go ahead. The following year the court of appeal upheld both decisions. The teenager spent a month with the family in 1993, during which he subjected the three girls and one boy, aged between eight and 12, to sexual abuse. The children were all diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The parents blamed themselves and both suffered severe depression. They felt unable to go on working as foster parents and Mr W could not continue as a youth worker. Their marriage broke up. A psychiatrist's report said: \"The effect on the family as a whole has been devastating. From a previously well-functioning family, their functioning has deteriorated markedly. They have lost employment. Their marital relationship has deteriorated and both parents have had increased illness since the disclosure of these events.\" The parents lost in the lower courts for the same reason that the families of the Hillsborough football ground disaster victims were denied compensation. The House of Lords held in the Hillsborough case that \"secondary\" victims - those who did not suffer the assault or accident themselves - could claim compensation for their psychological trauma only if they saw the incident with their own eyes or came upon the scene soon after. The parents' QC, Allan Levy, argued that they were \"primary\" victims of the disaster because they had played a part, although unintentionally, in bringing the abuser and the abused children together. Lord Slynn of Hadley, delivering judgment, said previous cases did not rule out this interpretation. \"I am not persuaded that in a situation like the present the parents must come across the abuser or the abused immediately after the sexual incident has terminated.\" The ruling means only that the parents have the right to take their case to court. They will still have to satisfy the trial judge that they are entitled to compensation.",

The drug, ABT 431, reversed working memory loss when it was tested on monkeys by scientists from Yale university school of medicine in the US. Scientists now want to conduct clinical trials. Man questioned on baby's death Police in Cumbria yesterday arrested a man in his 50s over the discovery of a baby's body on a rubbish tip 10 years ago. The police repeated an appeal they made in December, the 10th anniversary of the find, asking for anyone with fresh information to come forward. Following that appeal an anonymous caller left a message, and detectives are keen for them to call again. A council worker found the charred and mutilated remains of a boy, aged 12-18 months, on the tip at Redhills in Millom on December 1, 1989. The child's identity and his cause of death were never established. - John-Dominic Clare Judge to rule on Shayler case An Old Bailey judge will rule today on whether the Guardian and Observer newspapers should be forced to hand over information they allegedly hold on the former MI5 agent David Shayler. Both newspapers are fighting separate applications for production orders issued by special branch, which is investigating allegations that the former spy has breached the official secrets act. Lawyers for the newspapers have argued that the orders are an infringement of freedom of expression. Racing pigeons' sound barrier Concorde was yesterday blamed for confusing the homing instincts of racing pigeons. Shockwaves created by the jet as it breaks the sound barrier are claimed to make the birds go deaf. The pigeons are thought to recognise low-frequency sound to map their route. Jon Hagstrum, a geophysicist at the US Geological Society, in California, makes the claim in New Scientist magazine.",

      "body": "<b>Man's head found by railway line</b> <p>Police have launched a murder inquiry after a man's decaying head was discovered in a bag at the side of a railway line near a Derby industrial estate. It was found by a man taking a short cut across the line on Wednesday afternoon. </p> <p>The body has yet to be found. A home office pathologist carried out a postmortem examination on the remains at Derbyshire royal infirmary. </p> <p>It is understood an expert in dental forensics was called in to help possible identification. A forensic entomologist - expert in insects - was also understood to have been requested to determine how long the head had been on the railway embankment. </p> <p>A police source said: \"At this stage we do not even know if the decapitation was the cause of death.\" Officers were in contact with colleagues in Lincolnshire investigating the disappearance of a restaurateur. </p> <p>But early forensic tests eliminated the possibility of the head belonging to 25-year-old Rumel Iqbal Baker. Two men, Mark Falco, 39, and William Wharton, 55, both from the Lincoln area, are in custody accused of his murder despite no body being found. </p> <p><b>\u00a326,000 for 'disaster' holidays</b></p> <p>A group of holidaymakers was yesterday awarded a total of \u00a326,000 compensation for a luxury break that turned into a disaster. Two elderly couples and a family of four had paid \u00a37,000 each to travel by Concorde to Barbados in December 1998. </p> <p>When they arrived at the four star Tamarind Cove hotel in St James for the 10-day holiday they found workmen's rubbish, cement mixers and wires hanging out of the walls, Central London county court heard. </p> <p>Businessman Brian Sullivan, 56, his wife Jean, 52, and their daughters Nicola, 20, and Tara, 21, from Lymm in Cheshire, were awarded a total of \u00a312,000 for loss of enjoyment and inconvenience. </p> <p>Farmers Ronald Constantine, 72, and his wife, Prudence, 67, from Devizes in Wiltshire, were awarded \u00a39,000, and retired quantity surveyor Gordon Laurie, 78, and his wife Thelma, 75, of Milton, Cambridgeshire, were awarded \u00a35,000. </p> <p>They claimed the damages from tour operator Super- lative Travel, but the compensation is to be paid by the hotel. The holiday company was ruled to have booked the trip in good faith. </p> <p>Judge Kenneth Zuker said the hotel was disorganised and inefficient. \"This was an expensive package in a hotel where high standards could reasonably be expected.\" </p> <p><b>Deft gadget puts kettle in hot water</b></p> <p>Waiting for the kettle to boil could soon become a thing of the past with the launch today of a new kitchen appliance which provides boiling water at the turn of a tap. </p> <p>The device, named Boiling Point, was one of a selection of new products to be unveiled at the Ideal Home Show at Earls Court, west London. </p> <p>The urn-like dispenser, which fits under the sink, refills and reboils automatically. </p> <p>It can be fitted and working in 20 minutes and requires no plumbing experience to fit, plugging into a 13 amp socket, according to Leicester-based manufacturers Hotta (UK) Ltd. </p> <p>The Design Council chief executive, Andrew Summers, said: \"Boiling Point is one of the most innovative products and services created in Britain for the new millennium.\" </p> <p>Other inventions on display include DrainSmart, a device which fits on to pipes to filter out leaves and a vegetable drainer which clips on to pans to remove the need for a colander. </p> <p>Dyson also demonstrated its hands-free automatic vacuum cleaner which uses 50 sensors to navigate its way around a room. </p> <p>The event continues until April 9. </p> <p><b>How to get your pint quickly</b></p> <p>More than two-thirds of bar staff have regularly and deliberately ignored customers, according to a survey published yesterday. </p> <p>Bar staff questioned for the report said customers who banged on the bar were most likely to be ignored, followed by shouters, whistlers, finger clickers and money wavers. </p> <p>Female bar staff also revealed that male customers who flirted outrageously with them were likely to be ignored for the whole evening. </p> <p>The research, commissioned by Guinness to coincide with St Patrick's Day today, does offer a few tips to thirsty drinkers on how to get served quickly. </p> <p>According to the 1,220 bar staff interviewed the key to rapid service is a good position, a pensive worried expression, and a polite approach. </p> <p>Guinness advised customers to: </p> <p>\u0095 Select your bar position with care - almost half of bar staff (47%) recommended standing directly opposite the till as the bar staff must return there after each sale; </p> <p>\u0095 Lean over the bar at 45 degrees - two-thirds felt this was the optimum angle. Any further and it is too close, any less implies not being that thirsty; </p> <p>\u0095 Adopt a \"rabbit in headlights look\" - 30% of bar staff spot anxious looking customers. Looking too calm can indicate that a customer has already been served; </p> <p>\u0095 Point to the person next to you as being next in line - a quarter of all bar staff said they would return to you next; </p> <p>\u0095 Nod knowingly - 70% of bar staff claimed they give a quick nod to a customer to let them know they are on their way. Get your nod in first in their direction and they will feel obliged to serve you next. </p> <p><b>Judges cut \u00a34m fine for oil spillage</b></p> <p>The court of appeal yesterday reduced to \u00a3750,000 a record \u00a34m fine imposed on Milford Haven port authority over the Sea Empress oil tanker spillage. </p> <p>The authority had argued that the fine - four times higher than the previous largest for pollution - was \"far in excess of that which was proper or fair\". </p> <p>Lord Bingham, the lord chief justice, Mr Justice Alliott and Mr Justice Newman were told that the fine imposed by Mr Justice David Steel at Cardiff crown court in January last year had put the viability of the authority at risk. </p> <p>More than 72,000 tonnes of crude oil were spilt at the entrance to Milford Haven estuary after the tanker ran aground in February 1996 in the wake of a navigational error by an inexperienced port authority pilot. </p> <p>The disaster contaminated 120 miles of Welsh coastline and necessitated a \u00a360m clean-up operation. </p> <p>Lord Bingham said in judgment that the appeal court fully appreciated the trial judge's reasons for regarding the spillage as a very serious case calling for a substantial penalty. The judge had failed to give full credit to the authority's plea of guilty and had also failed to consider the possible impact of the \u00a34m fine on the authority's ability to perform its public functions. The fine was \"manifestly excessive\". </p> <p>Ted Sangster, managing director of Milford Haven port authority, said: \"The fine is one which we can pay without threatening the long-term future of the business.

      "bodyText": "Man's head found by railway line Police have launched a murder inquiry after a man's decaying head was discovered in a bag at the side of a railway line near a Derby industrial estate. It was found by a man taking a short cut across the line on Wednesday afternoon. The body has yet to be found. A home office pathologist carried out a postmortem examination on the remains at Derbyshire royal infirmary. It is understood an expert in dental forensics was called in to help possible identification. A forensic entomologist - expert in insects - was also understood to have been requested to determine how long the head had been on the railway embankment. A police source said: \"At this stage we do not even know if the decapitation was the cause of death.\" Officers were in contact with colleagues in Lincolnshire investigating the disappearance of a restaurateur. But early forensic tests eliminated the possibility of the head belonging to 25-year-old Rumel Iqbal Baker. Two men, Mark Falco, 39, and William Wharton, 55, both from the Lincoln area, are in custody accused of his murder despite no body being found. \u00a326,000 for 'disaster' holidays A group of holidaymakers was yesterday awarded a total of \u00a326,000 compensation for a luxury break that turned into a disaster. Two elderly couples and a family of four had paid \u00a37,000 each to travel by Concorde to Barbados in December 1998. When they arrived at the four star Tamarind Cove hotel in St James for the 10-day holiday they found workmen's rubbish, cement mixers and wires hanging out of the walls, Central London county court heard. Businessman Brian Sullivan, 56, his wife Jean, 52, and their daughters Nicola, 20, and Tara, 21, from Lymm in Cheshire, were awarded a total of \u00a312,000 for loss of enjoyment and inconvenience. Farmers Ronald Constantine, 72, and his wife, Prudence, 67, from Devizes in Wiltshire, were awarded \u00a39,000, and retired quantity surveyor Gordon Laurie, 78, and his wife Thelma, 75, of Milton, Cambridgeshire, were awarded \u00a35,000. They claimed the damages from tour operator Super- lative Travel, but the compensation is to be paid by the hotel. The holiday company was ruled to have booked the trip in good faith. Judge Kenneth Zuker said the hotel was disorganised and inefficient. \"This was an expensive package in a hotel where high standards could reasonably be expected.\" Deft gadget puts kettle in hot water Waiting for the kettle to boil could soon become a thing of the past with the launch today of a new kitchen appliance which provides boiling water at the turn of a tap. The device, named Boiling Point, was one of a selection of new products to be unveiled at the Ideal Home Show at Earls Court, west London. The urn-like dispenser, which fits under the sink, refills and reboils automatically. It can be fitted and working in 20 minutes and requires no plumbing experience to fit, plugging into a 13 amp socket, according to Leicester-based manufacturers Hotta (UK) Ltd. The Design Council chief executive, Andrew Summers, said: \"Boiling Point is one of the most innovative products and services created in Britain for the new millennium.\" Other inventions on display include DrainSmart, a device which fits on to pipes to filter out leaves and a vegetable drainer which clips on to pans to remove the need for a colander. Dyson also demonstrated its hands-free automatic vacuum cleaner which uses 50 sensors to navigate its way around a room. The event continues until April 9. How to get your pint quickly More than two-thirds of bar staff have regularly and deliberately ignored customers, according to a survey published yesterday. Bar staff questioned for the report said customers who banged on the bar were most likely to be ignored, followed by shouters, whistlers, finger clickers and money wavers. Female bar staff also revealed that male customers who flirted outrageously with them were likely to be ignored for the whole evening. The research, commissioned by Guinness to coincide with St Patrick's Day today, does offer a few tips to thirsty drinkers on how to get served quickly. According to the 1,220 bar staff interviewed the key to rapid service is a good position, a pensive worried expression, and a polite approach. Guinness advised customers to: \u0095 Select your bar position with care - almost half of bar staff (47%) recommended standing directly opposite the till as the bar staff must return there after each sale; \u0095 Lean over the bar at 45 degrees - two-thirds felt this was the optimum angle. Any further and it is too close, any less implies not being that thirsty; \u0095 Adopt a \"rabbit in headlights look\" - 30% of bar staff spot anxious looking customers. Looking too calm can indicate that a customer has already been served; \u0095 Point to the person next to you as being next in line - a quarter of all bar staff said they would return to you next; \u0095 Nod knowingly - 70% of bar staff claimed they give a quick nod to a customer to let them know they are on their way. Get your nod in first in their direction and they will feel obliged to serve you next. Judges cut \u00a34m fine for oil spillage The court of appeal yesterday reduced to \u00a3750,000 a record \u00a34m fine imposed on Milford Haven port authority over the Sea Empress oil tanker spillage. The authority had argued that the fine - four times higher than the previous largest for pollution - was \"far in excess of that which was proper or fair\". Lord Bingham, the lord chief justice, Mr Justice Alliott and Mr Justice Newman were told that the fine imposed by Mr Justice David Steel at Cardiff crown court in January last year had put the viability of the authority at risk. More than 72,000 tonnes of crude oil were spilt at the entrance to Milford Haven estuary after the tanker ran aground in February 1996 in the wake of a navigational error by an inexperienced port authority pilot. The disaster contaminated 120 miles of Welsh coastline and necessitated a \u00a360m clean-up operation. Lord Bingham said in judgment that the appeal court fully appreciated the trial judge's reasons for regarding the spillage as a very serious case calling for a substantial penalty. The judge had failed to give full credit to the authority's plea of guilty and had also failed to consider the possible impact of the \u00a34m fine on the authority's ability to perform its public functions. The fine was \"manifestly excessive\". Ted Sangster, managing director of Milford Haven port authority, said: \"The fine is one which we can pay without threatening the long-term future of the business. Lessons have been learned and changes have taken place in reducing the risk of this happening again in the future.\" Mall fined \u00a3100,000 for boy's death A shopping centre was yesterday fined \u00a3100,000 at Manchester crown court for an accident in which a six-year-old boy was crushed to death. Samuel Adams, from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, was killed by an 18 stone balustrade propped up against a wall at the Trafford Centre. It fell on him as he played on a stage in October 1998. The Trafford Centre had earlier pleaded guilty at Trafford magistrates court to breaching the health and safety at work act. It was also ordered to pay \u00a313,000 court costs. Andrew Long, prosecuting, told the crown court that departmental managers at the centre were unclear about their health and safety duties. Andrew Sander, for the centre, said the management had to accept there had been inadequate delegation about whose duty it should have been to replace the balustrades. The judge, Mr Justice Penry-Davey, said: \"It should have been obvious that large heavy items propped at an angle and unsecured could fall.\" Samuel's parents, Paul, 36 and Dawn, 35, described the fine as paltry. - Helen Carter",

At present Cowley makes the 75 executive model, Longbridge the smaller 25 and 45 models while work is already some way down the track at the West Midlands site to build a production line for the new Mini.</p> <p>As part of the deal agreed in principle between BMW and Alchemy the German carmaker will continue to supply the latter's MG Car Company with 75 models produced at Cowley.</p> <p>Though the move will mean BMW retains more responsibility for Rover than it might ideally like, it ensures production and sales of the 75 will not be hit by more potentially damaging disruption. BMW will also provide support to help establish the 25 and 45 models.</p> <p>However, work on the new Mini assembly line at Longbridge is to be halted and the machinery transferred to Cowley with BMW stating yesterday it expected the new car to be in showrooms by early summer of next year.</p> <p>Perhaps as importantly as what was said in the Munich announcement, was what was not said. No mention was made of the \"jewel in the crown\" Land Rover, Freelander, Discovery, Defender and Range Rover four-wheel drive vehicles coming out of the Solihull plant, which employs 10,000. These models are hugely popular.</p> <p>BMW may yet hang on to Solihull, rebranding it as the BMW Range Rover. But T&amp;G transport union chief negotiator Tony Woodley's disclosure that a potential bidder is already waiting in the wings suggests the company could be persuaded to sell if the price was right</p> <p>The four-wheel drive range would fit nicely into virtually any of the big companies, appealing to country weekenders with money to spend as well as parents on the school run.

      "bodyText": "BMW's radical surgery on what German executives snidely dismiss as the English Patient is unlikely to inspire a recovery of what is an already very sick car company. Carving up the body of Rover into small bits when the rest of the motor industry is merging appears to make little sense and may spell doom. If BMW, the world's 14th biggest car firm, could not deliver the economies of scale and productivity gains needed to secure Longbridge, what chance a group of venture capitalists? The Alchemy Partnership's first big idea is to change Rover's name to the MG Car Company but it will take more than a shiny new badge to avoid this acquisition crashing. City buccaneer Jon Moulton may be about to discover that saving an ailing motor manufacturer is trickier than reviving Fatty Arbuckles restaurants and Fads DIY stores. Pessimistic union leaders are braced for thousands of redundancies and fear, by the time Alchemy comes to sell it on after five or six years, it will be a shadow of its once great self. Under the agreement with BMW to be finalised over the next six weeks, Alchemy will take the Rover cars - the 25, 45 and 75 models plus the old Mini and the MGF sports car. The plan centres on the division of the two main manufacturing plants: Longbridge with 8,500 jobs and Cowley with 3,500. At present Cowley makes the 75 executive model, Longbridge the smaller 25 and 45 models while work is already some way down the track at the West Midlands site to build a production line for the new Mini. As part of the deal agreed in principle between BMW and Alchemy the German carmaker will continue to supply the latter's MG Car Company with 75 models produced at Cowley. Though the move will mean BMW retains more responsibility for Rover than it might ideally like, it ensures production and sales of the 75 will not be hit by more potentially damaging disruption. BMW will also provide support to help establish the 25 and 45 models. However, work on the new Mini assembly line at Longbridge is to be halted and the machinery transferred to Cowley with BMW stating yesterday it expected the new car to be in showrooms by early summer of next year. Perhaps as importantly as what was said in the Munich announcement, was what was not said. No mention was made of the \"jewel in the crown\" Land Rover, Freelander, Discovery, Defender and Range Rover four-wheel drive vehicles coming out of the Solihull plant, which employs 10,000. These models are hugely popular. BMW may yet hang on to Solihull, rebranding it as the BMW Range Rover. But T&amp;G transport union chief negotiator Tony Woodley's disclosure that a potential bidder is already waiting in the wings suggests the company could be persuaded to sell if the price was right The four-wheel drive range would fit nicely into virtually any of the big companies, appealing to country weekenders with money to spend as well as parents on the school run. Ford is said to be interested. Yesterday's BMW announcement gave little direct indication of the impact on Longbridge jobs as Alchemy pledged to \"employ a significant workforce\". But \"significant\" redundancies are the likely outcome as the new owners struggle to turn huge losses into profits. Longbridge's employees produce an average of 21 cars each a year compared with 33 across Rover as a whole - making the plant one of the most inefficient in Europe. Nissan, the most productive, churns out 98 per worker. While Alchemy, with BMW backing, will be able to get the existing model range to market the key will be its appetite and ability to develop its own models thereafter. One possibility would be for it to share the burden by, for example, taking another manufacturer's model on which to build a new car. That would solve one of the problems with which Rover has struggled - it had nine models for just 500,000 vehicles a year. \"The new company will focus on development of a state of the art British-built product range worthy of the sporting heritage of the MG name,\" said Alchemy. Union leaders fear it will produce the 25, 45 and 75 models while buyers can be found and concentrate any future investment on sports cars. They claim Alchemy may turn out to be little better than asset strippers, imposing redundancies and selling off surplus land. When the \"for sale\" sign goes up for the business in five or six years, it may be a specialist MG sports car company that is put on the market.

The study, by Unicef researchers for the Institute of Public Policy Research, indicates that the UK comes last among all 15 EU countries on three of seven specific indicators of child well-being, and is below average on a further two.

      "bodyText": "The government's goal of free admission to all national museums and galleries by 2001, which had seemed doomed, may now be back on track. An amendment to an obscure clause in VAT rules emerged yesterday as a possible solution to the impasse, which has caused the culture secretary, Chris Smith, acute discomfort. His pledge of free admission for all to the 23 national collections shortly after Labour came to power was seen as a bold sign that the government was serious about social inclusion. But it was resisted from the outset by a small number of charging institutions led by the Science Museum who claimed that the compensation package was inadequate. They insisted they would lose out twice because they would no longer be able to claim back their VAT. While Mr Smith was able to push through free admission for children last year, and an extension to pensioners will come into effect next month, the final move to universal free entry seemed beyond his reach. With falling attendances figures already blamed on the psychological impact of charging by such institutions as the Natural History Museum and the V&amp;A, museums themselves were also bitterly divided. But a novel solution championed by the national arts collections fund, which has worked with the department of culture on the proposal, could circumvent the problem. Under section 33 of the VAT act, local authorities and a number of organisations including the BBC are allowed to recover their tax. \"It should be a fairly simple procedure,\" the fund spokeswoman said. \"It applies to a very limited number of institutions so there is no question of customs and excise being swamped. The treasury could quickly and easily add the names of the 23 national collections to the list. The powers are there.\" The treasury is seen as the real obstacle. A department of culture spokesman said it was exploring the issues with customs and excise.",

The measures are expected to be in place by October to stave off threats of legal action by the European commission to ban all live sheep exports for the country's alleged failure to enable livestock to be traced back to the farms of their birth. The government wants to prove that there could be no repeat of the BSE in cattle fiasco when for years there was no watertight tracking system to find out the provenance of cows that fell ill. A commission official has told animal welfare activists led by TV scriptwriter Carla Lane that the government had told him that the \"permanent marking\" of all sheep and goats involving tagging would be in force within months. A letter signed on behalf of Robert Coleman, director general of the commission's health and consumer protection directorate said his officials would \"monitor the compliance\" by Britain and would not proceed with legal action \"providing the proposed timetable for regularisation is adhered to.\" Ms Lane, director of the Protesters Animal Information Network, which opposes all live sheep exports now topping 1m animals a year, said: \"The government is breaking the law.

Minutes of a meeting held last month and published yesterday state that the committee \"agreed further work needed to be done on screening of sheep for evidence of infection by the BSE agent but concluded that at present there was no need for further public health controls\". John Thorley, chairman of the National Sheep Association, said yesterday there was little likelihood of BSE in sheep.

      "body": "<p>Last week the latest Tango ad was banned. Why? Because it broke one of the great \"rules\" of advertising: don't encourage anti-social behaviour (it provoked playground bullying and shouting down megaphones into people's ears). Being banned is only one pitfall in the adversising world - the other big one is to have a terrible ad. But thankfully for advertisers there are plenty of strict guidelines laid down by the Independent Television Commission, the TV ads watchdog. And, unbeknownst to most of us, there are also the unwritten rules, guaranteed to keep clients happy and watchdogs at bay. Ignore them at your peril... </p> <p> <strong> 1. Always have at least three guys in the pub</strong> </p> <p> Never use just one bloke on his own in a beer ad. Adfolk have long since learnt that this would imply he has no mates and is a sad loser. Similarly, two blokes are to be avoided - this might suggest unwanted homosexual overtones. No, the formula for beer advertising is three or more fellas in a jolly, sociable drinking environment. (The ITC actually outlaws the depiction of one man with a pint, claiming solitary drinking encourages alcoholism). </p> <p> <strong> 2. Always have two Cs in a K</strong> </p> <p> The C stands for, well, a rude word for the female genitalia. The K stands for kitchen. This tried and tested approach to advertising washing-up powder or dishwasher detergent or any of the household cleaning products that tend to be exclusively targeted at women has worked for years. Happily, the formula is losing its supporters these days, but is still in evidence in ads for the more traditional fmcg (fast moving consumer goods) giants. </p> <p> <strong> 3. Always use that demo</strong> </p> <p> \"Demo\" is short for \"demonstration\", and should be deployed by products which supposedly require a bit of explaining, usually by \"experts\" in white coats. Think Bounty kitchenroll, where a glass of water is poured onto the improbably ultra-absorbent paper. Think also any number of beauty and hair products - these invariably involve a sciencey bit, in which far-fetched computer graphics \"demonstrate\" the product at work. </p> <p> <strong> 4. Never, NEVER, use red</strong> </p> <p> \"Sanpro\". You can trust adland to come up with a nicely sanitised word for what they see as a highly embarrassing market sector (namely, ahem, sanitary products). You must, of course, never, ever use red in this kind of advertisement. Oh no. You should always depict menstrual blood in a lurid blue - because red is, well, just too realistic and gruesome and therefore quite unacceptable in the shiny, Happy Family, pain-free world of adland. </p> <p> <strong> 5. Use that mountain pass</strong> </p> <p> In car ads, you should always insist on an extended \"packshot\" (lingering product close-up) of your vehicle in one of three settings: snaking mountain pass, improbably lush Tuscan countryside, or field of flames. The trick is to get several shots of the motor being driven by some smug bloke along an impossibly windy road. The same rule applies to ads for tyres/petrol/oil. </p> <p> <strong> 6. Keep smiling</strong> </p> <p> Received wisdom suggests that food ads should always: (1) feature a close-up of the product - preferably steaming invitingly, and (2) feature the person/people about to eat it smiling. You don't see glum faces in food advertising - glum doesn't sell, and suggests that said product isn't very appetising. Compare and contrast car ads, however, where you'll never see anyone grinning behind the wheel (considered to be too irresponsible). </p> <p> <strong> 7. Don't use too many words</strong> </p> <p> The number of words on a normal billboard-sized poster should never exceed seven, according to the late, great adman David Ogilvy. That's the most that people can read when whizzing past in their cars, apparently. Ogilvy also said that printed ads shouldn't use white words on a black background, because the human eye is used to black on white via most other printed materials. </p> <p> <strong> 8. Tell people what to do</strong> </p> <p> Research shows that website banner ads should say 'click here'. Otherwise, people won't. The response rate rockets by 400 per cent if there's a button. Which just goes to show how most rules about advertising are based on the entirely valid assumption that people are stupid. </p> <p> <strong> 9. Use lots of typefaces</strong> </p> <p> The world of direct marketing is littered with apparently proven theories on how to create effective junk mail. Numerous studies show that using lots of bolds and italics will send your readers reaching involuntarily for their chequebooks. Another rule suggests that every letter should have a P.S. - rather than making you look forgetful, it increases the effectiveness of your message. </p> <p> <strong> 10. Ignore the rules</strong> </p> <p> In advertising, the goldenest rule of all is to not follow the rules. Advertising fails to be effective if it is formulaic, and ads creatives pride themselves on trying to break with tradition as much as and as often as possible. If, unlike the boys and girls at Tango, they can get away with it.</p>",

The trick is to get several shots of the motor being driven by some smug bloke along an impossibly windy road. The same rule applies to ads for tyres/petrol/oil. 6. Keep smiling Received wisdom suggests that food ads should always: (1) feature a close-up of the product - preferably steaming invitingly, and (2) feature the person/people about to eat it smiling. You don't see glum faces in food advertising - glum doesn't sell, and suggests that said product isn't very appetising. Compare and contrast car ads, however, where you'll never see anyone grinning behind the wheel (considered to be too irresponsible). 7. Don't use too many words The number of words on a normal billboard-sized poster should never exceed seven, according to the late, great adman David Ogilvy. That's the most that people can read when whizzing past in their cars, apparently. Ogilvy also said that printed ads shouldn't use white words on a black background, because the human eye is used to black on white via most other printed materials. 8. Tell people what to do Research shows that website banner ads should say 'click here'. Otherwise, people won't. The response rate rockets by 400 per cent if there's a button. Which just goes to show how most rules about advertising are based on the entirely valid assumption that people are stupid. 9. Use lots of typefaces The world of direct marketing is littered with apparently proven theories on how to create effective junk mail. Numerous studies show that using lots of bolds and italics will send your readers reaching involuntarily for their chequebooks. Another rule suggests that every letter should have a P.S. - rather than making you look forgetful, it increases the effectiveness of your message. 10. Ignore the rules In advertising, the goldenest rule of all is to not follow the rules. Advertising fails to be effective if it is formulaic, and ads creatives pride themselves on trying to break with tradition as much as and as often as possible. If, unlike the boys and girls at Tango, they can get away with it.",

What a ghastly monument to the way we manage our industrial affairs in Britain\". </p> <p>There must be a slim volume - Sir John is a great believer in trimming back the fat - in his advice to industry.

Why does your heart sink at the words? It is filmed in Cardiff which Laurence Marks describes, rather to my surprise, as the Rio de Janeiro of the UK. As writers they have always seemed to be rooted so deeply and fruitfully in the east end of London, which is rarely mistaken for Rio. Dirty Work has a curious, ghostly resemblance to Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased), which is revived tomorrow, being about two detectives, one of them dying. Neil Pearson runs around a great deal, pursued by Hwyel Bennett at the top of his voice. \"One day,\" said Pearson, interrupting a woman in childbirth, \"you'll laugh about this.\" Not, however, this week.</p>",

His threnody over the needlessly dead was resonant: \"All the skills, all the ability, all the investment, all come to nothing. What a tragic waste! What a ghastly monument to the way we manage our industrial affairs in Britain\". There must be a slim volume - Sir John is a great believer in trimming back the fat - in his advice to industry. It could be called, after one of his most memorable, if confusing, injunctions, \"Get your bloody ducks in line!\" Dirty Work (BBC 1), the new Marks and Gran series, is a Welsh caper. Why does your heart sink at the words? It is filmed in Cardiff which Laurence Marks describes, rather to my surprise, as the Rio de Janeiro of the UK. As writers they have always seemed to be rooted so deeply and fruitfully in the east end of London, which is rarely mistaken for Rio. Dirty Work has a curious, ghostly resemblance to Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased), which is revived tomorrow, being about two detectives, one of them dying. Neil Pearson runs around a great deal, pursued by Hwyel Bennett at the top of his voice. \"One day,\" said Pearson, interrupting a woman in childbirth, \"you'll laugh about this.\" Not, however, this week.",

      "bodyText": "Alun Michael, the former Welsh secretary and home office minister, is to resign his seat in the Welsh assembly and stay on as an MP in a bid to pick up the threads of his Westminister political career. His decision, announced in Cardiff yesterday, comes just five weeks after his dramatic resignation as Labour leader in Wales and will make him the first assembly member to stand down since devolution less than a year ago. Under assembly rules Mr Michael's departure will not trigger a byelection. He was elected under the proportional representation system used to choose top-up candidates from regional party lists and will be replaced by the second name on Labour's list for mid and west Wales, Delyth Evans, a former BBC and HTV journalist. Ms Evans worked on the BBC's World at One and PM programmes before becoming a policy adviser and speechwriter to the former Labour leader John Smith. She will take her seat in the assembly from May 1. Mr Michael, who has represented Cardiff South and Penarth since 1987, has been considering his political future since resigning as first secretary of the national assembly during a no confidence debate on Labour's handling of European funding for Wales last month. The general committee of his constituency party have been urging him to stay on as their MP and Mr Michael consulted widely with family, friends and party workers before deciding to return to Westminster. The decision marks the end of an often turbulent chapter in his political career after being pressed by Downing Street to take on the job following the downfall of the former Welsh secretary Ron Davies. Mr Michael said yesterday that he remained a passionate advocate of devolution and that he was leaving the assembly without bitterness. He added that while he could make a continuing contribution in the assembly there was always a danger that a former leader could become \"an irritation and a negative force\". Rhodri Morgan, who took over as first secretary following Mr Michael's resignation last month, said: \"Alun has done an enormous amount to getting the assembly up and running, very often working under great pressure.\"",

Two disclosures yesterday cast doubt on what initially appeared to be a straightforward complaint from a member of the public to Elizabeth Filkin, parliament's standards commissioner, which led to Mr Livingstone being ordered to apologise to parliament for not disclosing the earnings made from speeches and newspaper articles. The first is the revelation that the original information which led to the complaint, apparently from a student, came from the former press officer to Mr Livingstone's main rival and the official Labour candidate, Frank Dobson. The second and more serious allegation, that the student was put up to making the complaint, was put in private to Alan Williams, the deputy chairman of the commons standard and privileges committee, last night. The revelation, which contradicts everything the student was saying yesterday and which came from an MP opposed to Mr Livingstone, suggests that someone else wrote the letter and got the student to sign it. Attempted set up Neither disclosure detracts from the substance of the findings of the Commons standards and privileges committee that Mr Livingstone broke parliamentary rules in not declaring the cash - but they do point to an attempt by opponents to set him up. Adrian McMenamin, Mr Dobson's former press spokesman, said last night that he was the source for a story published in the London Evening Standard on December 1 last year which released details of Mr Livingstone's fees for speaking engagements. Mr McMenamin said that the story did not appear until after he had left the Dobson camp to become a special adviser to the Welsh secretary, Paul Murphy. It was these disclosures that were used by a John C Jones of Shepshed, Leicestershire to form the basis of his complaint to Ms Filkin - since he quotes the Evening Standard article. The former Millbank official briefed journalist Hugh Muir believing that Mr Livingstone had clouded important details of his financial affairs which should be made public during the selection battle to win Labour's candidacy for London mayor. In the Evening Standard article, carried for only one edition in a paper not known to be a big seller in Shepshed, the then Tory spokesman for London, Shaun Woodward, said he planned to ask Ms Filkin why Mr Livingstone had not declared fees for speaking engagements in the members' register. But no letter of complaint was sent by Mr Woodward. On December 19, the day after he defected to the Labour Party, a letter was sent to the standards commissioner in the name of Mr Jones. Mr McMenamin said: \"I was the source of a story in the Evening Standard but I didn't have anything to do with the complaint. I have never met John Jones, or Shaun Woodward for that matter.\" Mr Jones himself denies that he ever put in a complaint at all. A research associate in the mechanical engineering department at Loughborough university, he told the Guardian yesterday: \"I have obviously been set up. I am trying to work.\" After being bombarded with press queries Mr Jones, who is completing his PhD, issued a statement through the university. \"None of this is anything to do with me, all I can think is someone else has written this letter of complaint and used my name and address. \"When I received the letter from the Commons authorities I called the commission as I didn't have the faintest idea what it was all about. I told them it wasn't me who had written the letter of complaint, that I knew nothing about it.\" Neighbour Eileen Start, chairwoman of Shepshed Labour Party, said she was bewildered by the affair, and found it hard to believe that anybody locally would want to set Mr Jones up in this way. Students at the university said there was no history of any student group getting involved in stunts or hoaxes to attract publicity or get back at people in the university. Mr Jones' department closed ranks. Neither the Labour nor Conservative parties have registered student bodies on campus this term. The university made no official comment beyond releasing Mr Jones' statement. But one official said privately: \"We've got to believe him, if he says he has nothing to do with it there is nothing else we can say.\" But this is where the information from the MP - who does not want to be named - appears to contradict this version. He is convinced that Mr Jones did sign the letter of complaint but did not write it. Demand for inquiry Mr Livingstone, meanwhile, demanded an inquiry. \"There will have to be an investigation into this matter and the timing before the London elections,\" he said last night. The irony of any possible attempt at subterfuge is that it would have been unnecessary: the decision condemning Mr Livingstone was taken independently by the committee. Mr Livingstone still has an overwhelming lead among Londoners in the race to become mayor, according to an ICM poll published yesterday. He enjoys more than 60% support just over a week after joining the campaign as an independent, a poll in the Evening Standard shows. It puts the former Greater London council leader on 61%, with his closest rival, Mr Dobson, on 16%, the Conservative candidate, Steve Norris, on 13% and Susan Kramer of the Liberal Democrats on 8%. Labour will draw some comfort from the fact that Mr Livingstone's lead is slightly down from the 55 percentage points recorded in a Guardian ICM poll published immediately after his declaration on March 6. But yesterday's findings will also put an end to suggestions that the Guardian poll - which put the Brent East MP on 68% and Mr Dobson on 13% - might have been a statistical freak or the product of initial excitement in the wake of Mr Livingstone's long-awaited announcement.",

In 1946, at a sensitive time for the future of Palestine, Willatts was seconded to the Anglo-American government committee of inquiry regarding the problems of European Jewry and Palestine to edit a series of maps on the resources and geographical potential of the country which formed part of the committee's report. The Royal Geographical Society awarded him the Gill Memorial in 1950 for research, and he was appointed an OBE in 1958. He helped to found, and later became an honorary member, of the British Cartographic Society. Willatts was a steadfast member of the Church of England in his home village of Horton, near Slough. His activities as churchwarden and good neighbour became, with his three children, the centre of his life after the death of his wife in 1979. \u0095 Edward Christie Willatts, geographer and cartographer, born July 4 1908; died January 8 2000",

Shortly after being ousted from his command of the elite strategic reserves (Kostrad) he issued a thinly-veiled threat against the president. \"It's dangerous, very dangerous if [Kostrad] soldiers get mad, as now they're deployed in every corner of the country,\" he said. Several Kostrad colonels, annoyed by the decision to replace Gen Suparman with Major General Agus Wirahadi kusumah, the most vocal advocate of reform, have adopted a strategy of passive resistance towards their new commander. \"It's clear there is growing resentment within sections of the military at what they see as the president's constant interference in their internal affairs,\" a western diplomat said. But most analysts discount any immediate threat of a coup. They believe that the president's statement was part of his longer-term strategy to bring the Indonesian military firmly under civilian control. The national police chief, Lieutenant General Rusdihardjo, played down the president's warning. \"Thus far I have not yet seen any efforts to overthrow the government,\" he said. He added that most potential plotters are now based outside Jakarta, making it very hard to stage a successful coup. In the last month there have been signs that the military is coming round to the idea of civilian supremacy in government. Admiral Widodo, the first non-army general to become armed forces chief, told a recent parliamentary hearing that the military is willing to relinquish its 38 seats in the 500-member lower house of parliament, but not in the upper house. He added that this year's defence spending would focus on the navy and air force in a bid to tackle escalating piracy and illegal fishing. Army sources say the special forces, Kopassus, responsible for much of the repression during the Suharto regime, are to be cut by more than 10% to about 5,000 troops. But analysts say there is still much reform to be done, particularly with regard to funding. The military has dozens of unaudited businesses through which it raises tens of millions of pounds every year. There has also been little movement to scrap the network of regional territorial commands, which for decades have been used to dampen the political aspirations of the rural masses.",

      "trailText": "Tuscany's Castello Banfi helped make Brunello di Montalcino one of the world's most sought-after wines. But now local resentment and rumours of skulduggery are threatening to tear apart this idyllic corner of Italy.",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The legend of Brunello starts with the day a traveller arrived in the dirt-poor hill town of Montalcino. He wandered past its crumbly houses and into the fields, sniffing the air, poking the soil, inspecting the few olive trees and scribbling in a notebook. The soil was poor and he left. Montalcino resumed its decay.</p> <p>The locals did not know that the stranger, Ezio Rivella, was euphoric and would soon return. He had found what he was seeking: a corner of the world capable of producing the greatest wine. A freak of nature had gifted the Tuscan town a unique microclimate.</p> <p>Fast-forward to the present day and wealth oozes from the terraced vineyards, rebuilt medieval castle, the BMWs, polished stone streets and azalea-fringed restaurants. Squalor and emigration are a folk memory to the young people who flock here for money and jobs. Crinkly sommeliers tell tourists how the grace of nature and a centuries-old winemaking tradition saved Montalcino from oblivion.</p> <p>Its salvation, Brunello, is a rich, powerful wine made from the Sangiovese grape. It is an object of acute desire hailed by connoisseurs and liable to fetch hundreds of pounds a bottle at Sotheby's. Merchants clamour for the right to sell it. Two 1995 vintages have just been awarded five stars.</p> <p>Demand far outstrips the strictly regulated supply. Those who get to taste it come away drooling adjectives such as intense, full-bodied, fruity, smooth, rich, chewy, velvety, super-ripe, spicy, gigantic. In the battle with the new world, Montalcino stands as a citadel of old world might and venerability.</p> <p>War chronicles date the town's winemaking to before 1500 and labels tend to be adorned with knights, monks and peasants rather than the legendary Ezio Rivella. Not because no one knows what he looked like, but because he spoils the myth. Rivella arrived in 1977.</p> <p>The Brunello fairy tale is a story of American corporate power buying up thousands of acres and imposing modern techniques to the horror of venerable but ailing low-quality local producers. Success has been achieved through market research, scientific analysis, mechanisation, high finance, advertising and, above all, money. Tons of it.</p> <p>The Appennines in the north and Mount Amiata in the south shelter the vineyards from African and winter air currents, but success has whipped up a tailwind they are helpless to block. Competition and greed are threatening the region's newfound wealth and glory.</p> <p>Rivella was - is - a famed oenologist. He was hired by the Mariani family, an Italian-American dynasty, to find the perfect spot to build a vineyard from scratch. His rovings stopped at Montalcino, an hour south of Siena.</p> <p>In addition to its mountain protection, it was blessed with an elevation of 900 to 1200ft and a location near the Mediterranean. The result was warm days, cool nights and just enough moisture to nourish a rugged, calcified soil. Just the place to invest $100m.</p> <p>Biondi Santi, a rival producer, released the first vintage from a clone of the Sangiovese grape in 1870, and established the wine as one of the highest class. Brunello was awarded its DOC classification in 1966, but the region remained largely unknown and unloved until the Marianis arrived.

      "bodyText": "The legend of Brunello starts with the day a traveller arrived in the dirt-poor hill town of Montalcino. He wandered past its crumbly houses and into the fields, sniffing the air, poking the soil, inspecting the few olive trees and scribbling in a notebook. The soil was poor and he left. Montalcino resumed its decay. The locals did not know that the stranger, Ezio Rivella, was euphoric and would soon return. He had found what he was seeking: a corner of the world capable of producing the greatest wine. A freak of nature had gifted the Tuscan town a unique microclimate. Fast-forward to the present day and wealth oozes from the terraced vineyards, rebuilt medieval castle, the BMWs, polished stone streets and azalea-fringed restaurants. Squalor and emigration are a folk memory to the young people who flock here for money and jobs. Crinkly sommeliers tell tourists how the grace of nature and a centuries-old winemaking tradition saved Montalcino from oblivion. Its salvation, Brunello, is a rich, powerful wine made from the Sangiovese grape. It is an object of acute desire hailed by connoisseurs and liable to fetch hundreds of pounds a bottle at Sotheby's. Merchants clamour for the right to sell it. Two 1995 vintages have just been awarded five stars. Demand far outstrips the strictly regulated supply. Those who get to taste it come away drooling adjectives such as intense, full-bodied, fruity, smooth, rich, chewy, velvety, super-ripe, spicy, gigantic. In the battle with the new world, Montalcino stands as a citadel of old world might and venerability. War chronicles date the town's winemaking to before 1500 and labels tend to be adorned with knights, monks and peasants rather than the legendary Ezio Rivella. Not because no one knows what he looked like, but because he spoils the myth. Rivella arrived in 1977. The Brunello fairy tale is a story of American corporate power buying up thousands of acres and imposing modern techniques to the horror of venerable but ailing low-quality local producers. Success has been achieved through market research, scientific analysis, mechanisation, high finance, advertising and, above all, money. Tons of it. The Appennines in the north and Mount Amiata in the south shelter the vineyards from African and winter air currents, but success has whipped up a tailwind they are helpless to block. Competition and greed are threatening the region's newfound wealth and glory. Rivella was - is - a famed oenologist. He was hired by the Mariani family, an Italian-American dynasty, to find the perfect spot to build a vineyard from scratch. His rovings stopped at Montalcino, an hour south of Siena. In addition to its mountain protection, it was blessed with an elevation of 900 to 1200ft and a location near the Mediterranean. The result was warm days, cool nights and just enough moisture to nourish a rugged, calcified soil. Just the place to invest $100m. Biondi Santi, a rival producer, released the first vintage from a clone of the Sangiovese grape in 1870, and established the wine as one of the highest class. Brunello was awarded its DOC classification in 1966, but the region remained largely unknown and unloved until the Marianis arrived. They called their company Banfi, after a Milanese aunt. The communist mayor and traditionalists watched in stupefaction as Yankee dollars bankrolled a convoy of bulldozers to carve Europe's largest contiguous wine estate: 7,100 acres. Hugh Johnson, the wine writer, exulted. \"The great wine estates of France have nothing to compare with it. In Italy, in Spain - indeed, in all of Europe - it is unique. Even the new world has no wine estate conceived on such a grand scale as the Castello Banfi.\" Overlooked by a Romanesque fortress, the rugged landscape became sloping amphitheatres that trapped the sun and allowed proper drainage, supplied by six artificial lakes.

Fulvio Cristofolini, who owns La Fuga, a four-hectare estate, praised Banfi's quality but worried whether it and other giants would ultimately undermine Tuscany's brand identity. Most serious of all, whispers are circulating that some vintners are cheating by incorporating grapes from other regions. Merchants are clamouring for more output, prices are high and the temptation is strong, says Piero Antinori, a vintner. It went largely unreported, but last September the Italian fraud squad seized more than a quarter of a million gallons of southern Italian wine - more than 110,000 cases - that were bottled and falsely labelled as Tuscan wine with the Indicazione Geographica Tipica (IGT) designation.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Whatever else they may say about him, nobody doubts that Ken Livingstone can tell jokes. \"He has this extraordinary ability to walk into a room, say 'Margaret Thatcher didn't like me and neither does Tony Blair', and the audience are instantly hooked,\" says one businessman who has seen the mayoral hopeful perform at a private function. But it was another extraordinary ability that stood out amid yesterday's headlines: from such winning remarks, it emerged, Livingstone had managed to amass previously undeclared income in the region of \u00a3100,000 - not so much by touting his services around super-rich global corporations, but by speaking to the likes of the Staffordshire Chartered Accountants, a gathering of insolvency lawyers and the Hertfordshire Chamber of Commerce.</p> <p>Big money - but nowhere near as big as it gets: the worldwide market in after-dinner speaking has never been healthier. In the months immediately following the Gulf war, General Norman Schwarzkopf - not so adept at the cheeky-chappie audience-wooing, but riding high on his reputation as the saviour of America's international glory - was routinely raking in \u00a3110,000 a night speaking to businesspeople hungry to apply his inspirational military anecdotes to the corporate world. At the heady summit of earnings power, though, sits Bill Cosby, whose \u00a3190,000 nightly bill eclipses even ex-president George Bush's \u00a375,000 asking price.</p> <p>But for all the cigar-chomping camaraderie of the circuit, this is a ruthless game and, most fascinatingly for the casual student of celebrity, the ultimate index of fame. Here, more than anywhere else, minor differences in levels of public success are thrown into humiliatingly sharp focus, as the nagging suspicion that your star may be setting is rudely confirmed by a drop in the price you can command. On the lowest rungs, a world away from Cosby, the has-beens and the never-quite-weres can pull in up to \u00a31,500 a night - \"the Emlyn Hugheses and the Ian McAskills\", as Brendan Barns, director of Speakers for Business, puts it. His agency is one of the four or five that have effectively cornered the market in after-dinner anecdotes, and it paid Livingstone up to \u00a335,000 for 10 speeches, according to the mayoral candidate's revised declaration of earnings. Barns's other clients include John Humphrys, David Mellor, Bill Morris, Sir Bernard Ingham and Sir Malcolm Rifkind.</p> <p>\"Speakers are like stocks and shares - they go up and down,\" says Barns. \"If they're on TV, if they do something outrageous, they're worth more.\" A reasonably talented MP or former parliamentarian - David Mellor, say, or Edwina Currie - can demand \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000 long after their ministerial responsibilities are behind them. Jung Chang, author of Wild Swans, has topped \u00a37,500; Terry Waite once commanded \u00a315,000. This is nothing, though, compared to the US market, where wealthy professional organisations and universities in need of an image makeover flock to the Washington Speakers Bureau to book the likes of Baroness Thatcher (thought to be valued at around \u00a335,000 a night), John Major, Schwarzkopf, journalist Bob Woodward, writer and broadcaster Tom Brokaw and former House speaker Newt Gingrich.</p> <p>It sounds like staggeringly easy money, but Tom Kenyon-Slaney - director of the London Speakers Bureau, another major UK agency - says he rejects numerous approaches from public figures whose estimations of their own worth exceed their talents. \"After the last election, I was contacted by about 40 former Conservative MPs, and I'd say we turned down pretty well every single one,\" Kenyon-Slaney says. \"Companies want these people for certain reasons - to entertain clients, to tell them where the economy's going - and frankly the vast majority of MPs are no use to man nor beast in that market.\"</p> <p>Like a slightly drunk elderly uncle over Christmas dinner, speakers develop the art of recycling anecdotes at event after event, hopeful that the response will stay fresh. Edwina Currie admits to having a few favourites: \"If I'm going up north, they'll get the story about the old lady who stopped me in the loos in a motorway service station and said 'You're from Rochdale', and I said 'No, I'm from Liverpool.' And she said: 'No, you must be from Rochdale because I'm from Rochdale, and I know you.' But if you tell that story down south, it sounds patronising.\"</p> <p>One of the better-paid female speakers, Currie has learned from experience that it pays to be selective. She is resolute, for example, that she won't do accountancy firms' dinner-dances, after a bad experience with some drunken accountants some years ago. \"The women's groups I speak to are much more ribald than male audiences. If it's a more male event, I find a smile or a funny facial expression will produce the laugh. One has to be more careful with what one says when there are men about.\"</p> <p>Prue Leith, another stalwart of the industry, says: \"If it's going well, it's a real buzz. But if it's a very hot afternoon and they've been bored rigid at a conference, and you're first on after their big lunch and you just see them dropping off in droves, it's horrible. I often tell them about when I was a food writer on the Daily Mail and I gave a recipe for toffee with 2lb of black treacle instead of 2tbsp. Something arrived on my desk that was quite obviously a bomb, squishy and with wires sticking out; but when the police opened it it was a piece of marmalade toffee with a dental brace and two teeth attached, and an orthodontist's bill. They love those tales of behind-the-scenes disaster.\"</p> <p>Sometimes a family connection is all it takes to develop a healthy extra income. For a fee somewhere in the region of \u00a38,000, Washington Speakers Bureau will provide you with Sergei Khrushchev - \"entrusted with his father's innermost thoughts during the editing of his memoirs\" - who promises to \"mesmerise audiences with rich background of behind-the-scenes life in the Soviet Union at the height of its power and influence\". Maureen Reagan - \"one of the top extemporaneous speakers in the nations [sic] . . . internationally known for her influence on the new world economy\", and only incidentally the daughter of Ronald - charges between \u00a36,000 and \u00a39,000.</p> <p>Some of the most sought-after names on the British circuit, though, are hardly famous at all outside the relatively closed world of professional institute dinners and charity galas. Professor Ken Robinson, a respected educationalist from the University of Warwick, is particularly popular - \"he has a unique ability to blend intellectual challenge with stand-up humour\", says one figure in the industry. So, even more unexpectedly, is Barbara Harmer, a former hairdresser who became the first woman to pilot Concorde. Sports stars of the present and past are unfailingly in demand; a couple of years ago, the Institute of Directors hired the entire surviving 1966 England football team for a private function, for the bargain price of around \u00a315,000.</p> <p>But there are signs that politicians are falling from favour; that whimsical anecdotes are out and hard-edged nuggets of strategic corporate wisdom are in. Business and motivational speakers such as Rosabeth Moss-Kanter, a professor at the Harvard Business School, typifies the new trend.</p> <p>\"There's definitely a feeling that with politicians you get so much of them these days that you probably don't want much more of them,\" says Kenyon-Slaney. \"There are exceptions - and Ken Livingstone is an obvious one. He's so charismatic, he has this wonderful ability to communicate; Tony Benn is another - but outspoken figures are very difficult to find now. There are only a handful in the House of Commons who can really command an audience.\"</p> <p>Some are attempting to adapt to the changing environment. One Jeffrey Archer (fee: \u00a330,000 to \u00a350,000) is registered with several US agencies, playing partly on his talents as a storyteller and partly on his reputation as the Comeback Kid.

      "bodyText": "Whatever else they may say about him, nobody doubts that Ken Livingstone can tell jokes. \"He has this extraordinary ability to walk into a room, say 'Margaret Thatcher didn't like me and neither does Tony Blair', and the audience are instantly hooked,\" says one businessman who has seen the mayoral hopeful perform at a private function. But it was another extraordinary ability that stood out amid yesterday's headlines: from such winning remarks, it emerged, Livingstone had managed to amass previously undeclared income in the region of \u00a3100,000 - not so much by touting his services around super-rich global corporations, but by speaking to the likes of the Staffordshire Chartered Accountants, a gathering of insolvency lawyers and the Hertfordshire Chamber of Commerce. Big money - but nowhere near as big as it gets: the worldwide market in after-dinner speaking has never been healthier. In the months immediately following the Gulf war, General Norman Schwarzkopf - not so adept at the cheeky-chappie audience-wooing, but riding high on his reputation as the saviour of America's international glory - was routinely raking in \u00a3110,000 a night speaking to businesspeople hungry to apply his inspirational military anecdotes to the corporate world. At the heady summit of earnings power, though, sits Bill Cosby, whose \u00a3190,000 nightly bill eclipses even ex-president George Bush's \u00a375,000 asking price. But for all the cigar-chomping camaraderie of the circuit, this is a ruthless game and, most fascinatingly for the casual student of celebrity, the ultimate index of fame. Here, more than anywhere else, minor differences in levels of public success are thrown into humiliatingly sharp focus, as the nagging suspicion that your star may be setting is rudely confirmed by a drop in the price you can command. On the lowest rungs, a world away from Cosby, the has-beens and the never-quite-weres can pull in up to \u00a31,500 a night - \"the Emlyn Hugheses and the Ian McAskills\", as Brendan Barns, director of Speakers for Business, puts it. His agency is one of the four or five that have effectively cornered the market in after-dinner anecdotes, and it paid Livingstone up to \u00a335,000 for 10 speeches, according to the mayoral candidate's revised declaration of earnings. Barns's other clients include John Humphrys, David Mellor, Bill Morris, Sir Bernard Ingham and Sir Malcolm Rifkind. \"Speakers are like stocks and shares - they go up and down,\" says Barns. \"If they're on TV, if they do something outrageous, they're worth more.\" A reasonably talented MP or former parliamentarian - David Mellor, say, or Edwina Currie - can demand \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000 long after their ministerial responsibilities are behind them. Jung Chang, author of Wild Swans, has topped \u00a37,500; Terry Waite once commanded \u00a315,000. This is nothing, though, compared to the US market, where wealthy professional organisations and universities in need of an image makeover flock to the Washington Speakers Bureau to book the likes of Baroness Thatcher (thought to be valued at around \u00a335,000 a night), John Major, Schwarzkopf, journalist Bob Woodward, writer and broadcaster Tom Brokaw and former House speaker Newt Gingrich. It sounds like staggeringly easy money, but Tom Kenyon-Slaney - director of the London Speakers Bureau, another major UK agency - says he rejects numerous approaches from public figures whose estimations of their own worth exceed their talents. \"After the last election, I was contacted by about 40 former Conservative MPs, and I'd say we turned down pretty well every single one,\" Kenyon-Slaney says. \"Companies want these people for certain reasons - to entertain clients, to tell them where the economy's going - and frankly the vast majority of MPs are no use to man nor beast in that market.\" Like a slightly drunk elderly uncle over Christmas dinner, speakers develop the art of recycling anecdotes at event after event, hopeful that the response will stay fresh. Edwina Currie admits to having a few favourites: \"If I'm going up north, they'll get the story about the old lady who stopped me in the loos in a motorway service station and said 'You're from Rochdale', and I said 'No, I'm from Liverpool.' And she said: 'No, you must be from Rochdale because I'm from Rochdale, and I know you.' But if you tell that story down south, it sounds patronising.\" One of the better-paid female speakers, Currie has learned from experience that it pays to be selective. She is resolute, for example, that she won't do accountancy firms' dinner-dances, after a bad experience with some drunken accountants some years ago. \"The women's groups I speak to are much more ribald than male audiences. If it's a more male event, I find a smile or a funny facial expression will produce the laugh. One has to be more careful with what one says when there are men about.\" Prue Leith, another stalwart of the industry, says: \"If it's going well, it's a real buzz. But if it's a very hot afternoon and they've been bored rigid at a conference, and you're first on after their big lunch and you just see them dropping off in droves, it's horrible. I often tell them about when I was a food writer on the Daily Mail and I gave a recipe for toffee with 2lb of black treacle instead of 2tbsp. Something arrived on my desk that was quite obviously a bomb, squishy and with wires sticking out; but when the police opened it it was a piece of marmalade toffee with a dental brace and two teeth attached, and an orthodontist's bill. They love those tales of behind-the-scenes disaster.\" Sometimes a family connection is all it takes to develop a healthy extra income. For a fee somewhere in the region of \u00a38,000, Washington Speakers Bureau will provide you with Sergei Khrushchev - \"entrusted with his father's innermost thoughts during the editing of his memoirs\" - who promises to \"mesmerise audiences with rich background of behind-the-scenes life in the Soviet Union at the height of its power and influence\". Maureen Reagan - \"one of the top extemporaneous speakers in the nations [sic] . . . internationally known for her influence on the new world economy\", and only incidentally the daughter of Ronald - charges between \u00a36,000 and \u00a39,000. Some of the most sought-after names on the British circuit, though, are hardly famous at all outside the relatively closed world of professional institute dinners and charity galas. Professor Ken Robinson, a respected educationalist from the University of Warwick, is particularly popular - \"he has a unique ability to blend intellectual challenge with stand-up humour\", says one figure in the industry. So, even more unexpectedly, is Barbara Harmer, a former hairdresser who became the first woman to pilot Concorde. Sports stars of the present and past are unfailingly in demand; a couple of years ago, the Institute of Directors hired the entire surviving 1966 England football team for a private function, for the bargain price of around \u00a315,000. But there are signs that politicians are falling from favour; that whimsical anecdotes are out and hard-edged nuggets of strategic corporate wisdom are in. Business and motivational speakers such as Rosabeth Moss-Kanter, a professor at the Harvard Business School, typifies the new trend. \"There's definitely a feeling that with politicians you get so much of them these days that you probably don't want much more of them,\" says Kenyon-Slaney. \"There are exceptions - and Ken Livingstone is an obvious one. He's so charismatic, he has this wonderful ability to communicate; Tony Benn is another - but outspoken figures are very difficult to find now. There are only a handful in the House of Commons who can really command an audience.\" Some are attempting to adapt to the changing environment. One Jeffrey Archer (fee: \u00a330,000 to \u00a350,000) is registered with several US agencies, playing partly on his talents as a storyteller and partly on his reputation as the Comeback Kid. His biography on the website of Leading Authorities, a Washington-based speakers' bureau, relates the tale of how bankruptcy and ignominious resignation - the first one, at any rate - were transformed into spectacular wealth and success. His specialism, according to the agency, is \"inspiration and motivation\". Premier league: international stars First division Speakers: Bill Cosby, Norman Schwarzkopf, Colin Powell. Typical audience: Top-flight conventions and US charity galas. Fee: Up to \u00a3190,000. What do you get for your money? Cosby trades in on decades as a successful stand-up comedian and sitcom actor and takes top dollar. General Schwarzkopf settled for \u00a3120,000 a speech after his triumphant return from the Gulf war. The commander \"talks about goals, high standards, affording others the ability to learn and his own Rule 13 (When in command, take charge) and 14 (Do what's right).\" Powell, the former chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, \"chronicles a journey that begins with his childhood in the South Bronx, continues through his military career, his experiences as a best-selling author and then culminates with his focus in retirement on the many philanthropic endeavours with which he is involved\". He takes home \u00a360,000 for his pains. First division: best of British Speakers: Baroness Thatcher, John Major, Jeffrey Archer. Typical audience: Ivy league universities. Fee: Up to \u00a350,000. What do you get for your money? \"Lady Thatcher reflects that as we enter the 21st century there is much to be optimistic about: the downfall of communism; the break-up of the Soviet Union; and the advance of liberty and free enterprise.

As a result, the sealed-envelope system was adopted the next year. 1953 The Oscars were first televised live from Hollywood with Bob Hope as master of ceremonies and from the NBC International Theatre in New York with Fredric March making the presentations. 1966 The Oscars were first broadcast in colour. 1969 The 41st Academy Awards ceremonies moved to the brand new Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music Centre of Los Angeles County. The Awards remained at the Music Centre until 1986, when the ceremonies returned to the Shrine Auditorium for the 60th and 61st Awards. Since then the Awards have moved back and forth between the Shrine and the Music Centre. A new venue, located at the corner of the Hollywood and Highland boulevards, is currently being constructed as a permanent home for the awards; it's hoped that it will be in use for the 2002 ceremony.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When you're making a film about police and thieves, and the local armourer has to provide a crack police squad to prevent ambush of the film company's stash of weapons, art really is life and it happens on the run. </p> <p>\"You have to be able to move quickly - get in, shoot and get out before too many people are around,\" says Chris Blackwell, founder of Island records and promoter of Bob Marley, who has set up a small film and music company in Jamaica called Palm Pictures. He's talking about the smash hit Third World Cop, which follows the equally low-budget ragga fairytale, Dancehall Queen (1997) in re-awakening interest in the idea of home-grown film. The \"industry\" had been in a slump since the 70s following the cult success of The Harder They Come (1972). </p> <p>\"It had a great title and was a project we could get right,\" he says of his decision to run with Third World Cop. A story of childhood friends, Ratty (Mark Danvers) and Capone (Paul Campbell) who grow up to find themselves on opposite sides of the law, it was made for $570,000 (US) and has become the highest grossing film in the country's history, taking over $500,000 at the box office. Blackwell hopes that his innovative use of digital film will mean he can make two or three similar movies a year with a crew of two or three. Third World Cop - which took 20 days to shoot - involved 47 people, plus apprentices from the Area Youth Foundation, and two police crews. </p> <p>Jamaica has been described as a land of natural storytellers which spontaneously lends itself to movie-making, so when audiences get the rare chance to identify with their own stories and characters, they participate by making \"nuff noise\", whooping and heckling and pointing their fingers in the shape of guns at the screen. Third World Cop was sold out for two days after it opened last October. Even Blackwell couldn't get a seat. </p> <p>\"We have to make these films at a very low cost so they can pay for themselves with the Jamaican audience initially, and hope that one of them will catch a much wider market,\" says Blackwell, who secured foreign distribution deals by emailing the Third World Cop web address around the world. For Brits and Americans who persevere with the patois, Jamaican films can tap you into a raw, sometimes terrifying energy: you come away feeling that you wouldn't last a day on the brutally poor streets of downtown Kingston. </p> <p>\"The film is totally realistic. It was written with real stories. It captures absolutely the authentic texture of life in the Kingston ghettos,\" says Suzanne Fenn, the film's co-writer and editor. Fenn, who grew up in France, has worked with the likes of Godard and Louis Malle, but a holiday to Jamaica during which she met veteran actor Carl Bradshaw led initially to her involvement in Dancehall Queen, and changed her life. Travelling from LA to Jamaica for the first time, she suddenly felt, \"Oh, I remember what I thought life was\". </p> <p>When Carolyn Pfeiffer (an American producer married to a friend of Blackwell's) originated the idea of Third World Cop in 1995 she got Blackwell's blessing but the idea was stillborn without a writer. </p> <p>\"She liked the way I developed the characters in Dancehall Queen and asked me to write the script,\" says Fenn. \"I agreed although I knew nothing about cops, even less Jamaican cops.\" Since it would be based on a true story, Fenn thought she could handle it. But the man whose life it was based on refused to co-operate. Fenn was rescued by English journalist and biographer Chris Salewicz, but they no longer had a true story to work with. </p> <p>\"Look into the life of Natty Morgan,\" Bradshaw advised, enigmatically. Morgan was a well-known Jamaican Robin Hood-type character, who had evaded the police for months by living in the swamps. The idea tied in nicely with Jamaican film lore, since The Harder They Come (also featuring Bradshaw) was based around a true story too - of Rhygin, a 40s gunman. Fenn and Salewicz went to meet Jamaican crime reporters and sifted through their files on Morgan and other gunmen. </p> <p>Blackwell rejected the first draft and Salewicz left to work on a TV project. He was replaced by music video and short film director Chris Browne, who went on to direct Third World Cop. \"We interviewed cops for two months, went on picnics with them and their families and entered the Jamaican cop psyche,\" Fenn remembers. But every time they invented something, Blackwell instinctively didn't like it. \"He kept saying, 'You're going to have to gather stories for months and weave them in'. Each time he would stop liking it when we cheated.\" </p> <p>Casting took two and a half months because Blackwell was adamant about using \"real hard-core original faces\" so that Fenn and the casting agent had to hand-pick most of the extras. Musicians Scaredem Crew were cast as the members of the gun-running gang, and several well-known DJs were cast in small parts to add to the sense of authenticity. Third World Cop's intense reggae/dancehall soundtrack was produced by the Riddim Twins, Sly and Robbie. </p> <p>Trouble brewed as soon as the crew ventured into the ghetto to shoot. \"You can't shoot in a ghetto without giving something back because ghetto people are so poor, they'd feel cheated if you did that,\" says Fenn. On every location, people from the area must be used as extras, and a slice of budget and food given to the community. </p> <p>\"We had heavy adventures,\" says Fenn. \"In one area we paid our location fee to a group of people only to find out on the day of the shoot that they were squatters and that the real owner had not been paid. Another time a marginal element of the community viewed us as a target for extortion and disrupted our shoot for ransom,\" Fenn adds. The film was edited and the music recorded locally, but Blackwell had to organise the rest of the post-production in LA. </p> <p>The dangers of working in urban Jamaica are obvious, but for Fenn and crew, the reward is being able to make films in an authentically raw, creative way.</p> <p>\u0095 Third World Cop opens next Friday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When you're making a film about police and thieves, and the local armourer has to provide a crack police squad to prevent ambush of the film company's stash of weapons, art really is life and it happens on the run. \"You have to be able to move quickly - get in, shoot and get out before too many people are around,\" says Chris Blackwell, founder of Island records and promoter of Bob Marley, who has set up a small film and music company in Jamaica called Palm Pictures. He's talking about the smash hit Third World Cop, which follows the equally low-budget ragga fairytale, Dancehall Queen (1997) in re-awakening interest in the idea of home-grown film. The \"industry\" had been in a slump since the 70s following the cult success of The Harder They Come (1972). \"It had a great title and was a project we could get right,\" he says of his decision to run with Third World Cop. A story of childhood friends, Ratty (Mark Danvers) and Capone (Paul Campbell) who grow up to find themselves on opposite sides of the law, it was made for $570,000 (US) and has become the highest grossing film in the country's history, taking over $500,000 at the box office. Blackwell hopes that his innovative use of digital film will mean he can make two or three similar movies a year with a crew of two or three. Third World Cop - which took 20 days to shoot - involved 47 people, plus apprentices from the Area Youth Foundation, and two police crews. Jamaica has been described as a land of natural storytellers which spontaneously lends itself to movie-making, so when audiences get the rare chance to identify with their own stories and characters, they participate by making \"nuff noise\", whooping and heckling and pointing their fingers in the shape of guns at the screen. Third World Cop was sold out for two days after it opened last October. Even Blackwell couldn't get a seat. \"We have to make these films at a very low cost so they can pay for themselves with the Jamaican audience initially, and hope that one of them will catch a much wider market,\" says Blackwell, who secured foreign distribution deals by emailing the Third World Cop web address around the world. For Brits and Americans who persevere with the patois, Jamaican films can tap you into a raw, sometimes terrifying energy: you come away feeling that you wouldn't last a day on the brutally poor streets of downtown Kingston. \"The film is totally realistic. It was written with real stories. It captures absolutely the authentic texture of life in the Kingston ghettos,\" says Suzanne Fenn, the film's co-writer and editor. Fenn, who grew up in France, has worked with the likes of Godard and Louis Malle, but a holiday to Jamaica during which she met veteran actor Carl Bradshaw led initially to her involvement in Dancehall Queen, and changed her life. Travelling from LA to Jamaica for the first time, she suddenly felt, \"Oh, I remember what I thought life was\". When Carolyn Pfeiffer (an American producer married to a friend of Blackwell's) originated the idea of Third World Cop in 1995 she got Blackwell's blessing but the idea was stillborn without a writer. \"She liked the way I developed the characters in Dancehall Queen and asked me to write the script,\" says Fenn. \"I agreed although I knew nothing about cops, even less Jamaican cops.\" Since it would be based on a true story, Fenn thought she could handle it. But the man whose life it was based on refused to co-operate. Fenn was rescued by English journalist and biographer Chris Salewicz, but they no longer had a true story to work with. \"Look into the life of Natty Morgan,\" Bradshaw advised, enigmatically. Morgan was a well-known Jamaican Robin Hood-type character, who had evaded the police for months by living in the swamps. The idea tied in nicely with Jamaican film lore, since The Harder They Come (also featuring Bradshaw) was based around a true story too - of Rhygin, a 40s gunman. Fenn and Salewicz went to meet Jamaican crime reporters and sifted through their files on Morgan and other gunmen. Blackwell rejected the first draft and Salewicz left to work on a TV project. He was replaced by music video and short film director Chris Browne, who went on to direct Third World Cop. \"We interviewed cops for two months, went on picnics with them and their families and entered the Jamaican cop psyche,\" Fenn remembers. But every time they invented something, Blackwell instinctively didn't like it. \"He kept saying, 'You're going to have to gather stories for months and weave them in'. Each time he would stop liking it when we cheated.\" Casting took two and a half months because Blackwell was adamant about using \"real hard-core original faces\" so that Fenn and the casting agent had to hand-pick most of the extras. Musicians Scaredem Crew were cast as the members of the gun-running gang, and several well-known DJs were cast in small parts to add to the sense of authenticity. Third World Cop's intense reggae/dancehall soundtrack was produced by the Riddim Twins, Sly and Robbie. Trouble brewed as soon as the crew ventured into the ghetto to shoot. \"You can't shoot in a ghetto without giving something back because ghetto people are so poor, they'd feel cheated if you did that,\" says Fenn. On every location, people from the area must be used as extras, and a slice of budget and food given to the community. \"We had heavy adventures,\" says Fenn. \"In one area we paid our location fee to a group of people only to find out on the day of the shoot that they were squatters and that the real owner had not been paid. Another time a marginal element of the community viewed us as a target for extortion and disrupted our shoot for ransom,\" Fenn adds. The film was edited and the music recorded locally, but Blackwell had to organise the rest of the post-production in LA. The dangers of working in urban Jamaica are obvious, but for Fenn and crew, the reward is being able to make films in an authentically raw, creative way. \u0095 Third World Cop opens next Friday.",

But to sympathise with her is to make a leap that Peirce wasn't sure a large slice of her audience would be capable of: Brandon was a transsexual, a girl who passed herself off as a boy. In the logic of the Nebraska outpost she came from, she forfeited her right to public sympathy when she shoved a pair of socks down her trousers and started dating the town's girls.</p> <p>Now that the film has won a Golden Globe award and is nominated for two Oscars, Peirce's faith in a five-year-long project has been vindicated. The good reception that Boys Don't Cry has had, particularly in the conservative mid-west where the story takes place, is only upstaged by the fact that it is Peirce's first film. In April 1994, while enrolled on a graduate film course at Columbia University - she is now in her early 30s - she started reading reports in the press about a hate crime that had rocked a little place called Falls City, way out in Nebraska. </p> <p>\"I was writing another script at the time, based on a true story about a woman who passed as a man during the civil war. Then I picked up the Village Voice and started reading about Brandon.\" Teena Brandon, or Brandon Teena as (s)he called him/herself, was a popular fixture in Falls City. He drank with the boys, dated the girls, fell in love with a bold young woman called Lana and, when his identity as a woman was discovered, was shot dead by two young men who couldn't process the inverted values that came with his unmasking.</p> <p>The story was picked up by the New York Times and the New Yorker; a novel and a play were written about it. \"I fell in love with a story that was bigger than me,\" says Peirce. \"It was capturing the nation's imagination.\" </p> <p>While much of the coverage concentrated on the brutal killing and the \"freak\" factor of Brandon's sexuality, what interested Peirce was the love story between Brandon and Lana. The film student made a brave move: she caught a plane to Nebraska and, inspired by such prose works as Truman Capote's In Cold Blood and Norman Mailer's The Executioner's Son, began doing some background journalism.</p> <p>She attended the killers' trials; she interviewed the witnesses; she read every scrap of material on the case until, two years and another visit later, the angle of her story became clear to her. The extraordinary fact about the case, Peirce thought, was that these people weren't east coast sophisticates dabbling with homosexuality, but a young couple from redneck country, heroic enough to love each other even after it emerged that both of them were girls. </p> <p>Lana, whom Peirce interviewed at length, resents any suggestion that she is a lesbian. Her suspension of disbelief about Brandon's identity is at the psychological heart of the movie. She still alternates her references to his gender. Against the backdrop of an endless Nebraska skyline, this really is the stuff of poetry, of love as the ultimate agent of transformation. When Peirce first came up against it, however, it threatened to blow her whole story. </p> <p>\"I said to Lana, when did you first know that Brandon was a girl? She replied, 'Oh, I knew the day that I met him.' I thought if she knew when she met him, there's no story here. Then she said, 'No, I didn't really know until that day Brandon told me.' Then she said, 'No I didn't really know until later.' \"</p> <p>Lana and Brandon had planned to run away together and when Peirce asked Lana if they meant to go as lovers or as friends, Lana replied, \"As friends, of course, because Brandon was a girl.\" But when Peirce mentioned Brandon's desire for a sex change, Lana said quickly, \"Brandon didn't need a sex change, he was always a man to me\" As Peirce says, \"Whether Brandon is a boy or girl changes for Lana, sentence by sentence. So I have to ask myself, what can I trust? I can trust that she loves Brandon.\" </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the synopsis of a film this complicated, did not excite a bidding war between the major studios. Peirce didn't even set out with idea of making a feature film. She gained her first degree in English and Japanese literature at the University of Chicago, during which time she spent two years living in Japan and working as a stills photographer. After moving to New York's Columbia University, she progressed from stills to making 16mm shorts. One, the Last Good Breath, about two lovers who take turns sacrificing themselves to survive a war, won second place at the Canada international film festival. </p> <p>When Peirce wrote the script of Boys Don't Cry, it was as her graduate thesis, and she filmed a short version of it. But somewhere around 1995 she began to realise its potential as a feature film. But there were serious difficulties. As well as the challenging nature of its material, Peirce was a first-time director who wanted to retain full creative control. She could have had \"high risk\" printed across her forehead. \"The fact that the movie could not get made made total sense to me,\" she says. \"My culture destroyed Brandon, my culture couldn't make sense of Brandon, I made sense of Brandon.\" </p> <p>Peirce frowns under the weight of her mission to inspire awe not disgust for Lana and Brandon. The impression Peirce gives is of an earnest, incredibly hard-working woman, erring on the side of sobriety, but passionate about her material to an extent that makes it hard to imagine how she would handle a story she was less personally involved in. </p> <p>In the project's early days, Peirce was helped by the casting of Hilary Swank in the lead role as Brandon and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny as Lana. Swank is superb, utterly believable as a male lead, and Sevigny brings her usual, Plasticine-featured intensity to the role. Both have been nominated for Oscars and Swank won the best actress award at this year's Golden Globes after Fox Searchlight, an arm of Rupert Murdoch's Fox, eventually backed the film on the strength of a 20-minute trailer. </p> <p>What is most surprising in all this the way the American heartlands have reacted to the film. When it showed in St Louis, Missouri, people poured round Peirce after the screening to congratulate her. \"I loved Brandon,\" a lot of them said, no minor admission, since to make this statement they had had to digest a scene in which one girl wearing a dildo made love to another girl who believed her to be a boy. Yet digest it they did.</p> <p>\"In St Louis there was a question-and-answer session after the film,\" says Peirce. \"The greatest thing that emerged from it was that the audience didn't think of Brandon as a sexual deviant. My aim had been to make him as deeply human as possible, so that people fell in love with him the way that Lana did; so that they didn't think gay, didn't think weird, just thought Brandon. And that's what happened.\" </p> <p>They were helped along in this by a shift in American culture that has been symbolised by the public reaction to the Matthew Shepherd case. When Brandon was murdered in 1993, the public outcry was limited. When Matthew Shepherd, a gay student, was murdered in Wyoming last year, the outcry was huge and Shepherd became an icon for everyone opposed to what Peirce calls \"the straight white boys picking up guns and taking their frustrations out on people who aren't like them. When Brandon was killed, the country wasn't as aware of its own cultural violence as it is now. Now the corporate financiers are looking at my film and saying, oh my God, you're recognising a problem that's out there. But the problem has been out there.\" </p> <p>The story of his life is, Peirce believes, the story of a wounded culture that is only just beginning to look at itself without panicking at what it sees. For a while after the crime, Lana was ostracised in Falls City and moved to live with an aunt in Omaha. She is back at home now, though, has had a baby and is finding that the prevailing sentiment towards her is curiosity not hostility. She did, however, launch a lawsuit just prior to the film's release against Fox for invasion of privacy, which was settled out of court. Peirce is still in touch with her and intends to remain so. \"The great thing is that in the end, Lana didn't know anything about gender politics. She was just trying desperately to hang on to something that was beautiful in her life.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Boys Don't Cry is released on April 7.</p>",

But if you like the play, you should enjoy this fairly respectful film, although for no apparent reason, Hoffman moves the action to the turn of the 19th century and puts Calista Flockhart on a bicycle. In an Anglo-American cast where everyone gets to use their own accent, she is the best of the Yanks and, in a scene more McBealian than Shakespearian, gets to mud-wrestle Anna Friel. But Kevin Kline is not my idea of a Bottom, and I speak as a man who once saw Frankie Howerd's Bottom at the Old Vic. No, don't titter. With or Without You Rental FilmFour Cert 18 *** A video premiere that deserves to be noticed. It's made, by the always interesting Michael Winterbottom on a small scale, and is headlined by couch-potato friendly names Christopher Eccleston and Dervla Kirwan. They are a fairly happy married couple in Belfast with one problem: they're struggling to reproduce (and a crowded family dinner table lets you know how big the pressure to be a parent is). Her old French pen pal (Yvan Attal) turns up out of the blue and his ex (Julie Graham) does her best to tempt the husband off the marital straight and narrow. Eccleston is also chafing at the bit working for his father-in-law after giving up his old job as a policeman, and regular Eccleston watchers will know that when it comes to seething with resentment, he's the current British number one. Events and tangled relationships come to a boil in an involving way in a nicely observed TV film stuffed with believable characters. American Perfekt Rental and DVD Blue Dolphin Cert 15 ** An interesting cast including Tarantino refugees Amanda Plummer and Robert Forster - and David Thewlis, as an unconvincing cockney - turn up in a low-budget road movie. This is the kind of thing that often provides interesting, offbeat little films superior to average Hollywood product, but from interesting beginnings, this one soon becomes too self-consciously wacky for its own good with characters ranging from devious to deranged. It went straight to video and very slowly - Forster made this before the career-reviving Jackie Brown.",

His appointment directly violates a staffing rule that close family members are not eligible for employment. </p> <p>The appointment has divided staff in the bank. In a strongly-worded internal memo, seen by the Guardian yesterday, the staff association complains that giving a senior bank job to Prof Stern \"easily lends itself to a perception of nepotism and corruption in the bank\" which hampers its efforts to eradicate graft in the third world. </p> <p>\"With deep regret, therefore, and without comment on the talents of Prof Stern, the staff association believes that the offer of the chief economist's job to Prof Stern must be retracted,\" the memo says. </p> <p>Prof Stern, 53, is a distinguished development economist who teaches at the London School of Economics. His appointment to the World Bank, in succession to Joseph Stiglitz, was announced last week. Most observers thought he would enhance the bank's prestige and intellectual clout. </p> <p>But following the staff rebellion, his appointment now appears to be in doubt. A spokeswoman for the bank said last night that the president, Jim Wolfensohn, was consulting staff to try and win them round. \"Over the next 24 to 48 hours you will probably have a sense of what's happening,\" said the spokeswoman. \"But my understanding is that Nick Stern has been given the job.\" </p> <p>In response to the staff association's complaint, Mr Wolfensohn, a former Wall Street investment banker, fired off an email - also seen by the Guardian - defending Prof Stern's appointment which, he insists, was free of favouritism. </p> <p>Mr Wolfensohn says that Prof Stern was appointed on the unanimous recommendation of independent selection committee comprising Mr Stiglitz, Amartya Sen, the Nobel prize-winning economist, and Jeffrey Goldstein, one of the bank's former managing directors, and that no one else at the bank had anything to do with the process. </p> <p>\"I knew of the existence of staff rule 4.01 and was advised by the general council that under article 5, section 5 of the bank's articles of agreement, I, as president, and subject to the general control of the executive directors, had the legal right to waive the application of any staff rule when it is in the best interests of the institution to do so,\" says Mr Wolfensohn. </p> <p>\"I concluded that on this occasion, and was supported by the board, that the circumstances were such that this is a case where I should exercise my discretion. </p> <p>\"I believed the integrity of the process and the quality of the individual would be sufficient to rule out the reality or perception of nepotism or corruption. </p> <p>\"I can assure you that I stand as strong as ever against them.\" </p> <p>The staff association memo points out that, in the past, several staff members have had jobs denied to family members expressly because of the bank's internal rules and that others have been fired when it became known that they had broken it. </p> <p>Accusing the bank of only applying the rules to \"little people\" and not \"to those in positions of power\", it says: \"Dual standards of this kind simply cannot be part of the bank.\" </p> <p>It goes on to commend Mr Wolfensohn for taking a strong stand against corruption but complains that the appointment of Prof Stern undermines the bank's credibility when dealing with developing countries. </p> <p>\"Nepotism is, of course, a part of corruption. Many of the staff who have communicated with the staff association on this issue believe the appointment of Mr Stern easily lends itself to a perception of nepotism and corruption in the bank . . . The staff association must express its deep disappointment that the bank group management and the board approved this appointment. The association believes it must disassociate itself from this appointment because it represents a flagrant disregard for very important and time-tested rules on the bank. </p> <p>\"It also believes that as this appointment stands it will badly tarnish the image of the bank, threaten the bank by exposing staff to pressure on appointments of relatives, and ultimately demean the ability of staff to speak in a credible way with clients about corruption and hamper our work on issues of governance.\"</p>",

Mr Wolfensohn says that Prof Stern was appointed on the unanimous recommendation of independent selection committee comprising Mr Stiglitz, Amartya Sen, the Nobel prize-winning economist, and Jeffrey Goldstein, one of the bank's former managing directors, and that no one else at the bank had anything to do with the process. \"I knew of the existence of staff rule 4.01 and was advised by the general council that under article 5, section 5 of the bank's articles of agreement, I, as president, and subject to the general control of the executive directors, had the legal right to waive the application of any staff rule when it is in the best interests of the institution to do so,\" says Mr Wolfensohn. \"I concluded that on this occasion, and was supported by the board, that the circumstances were such that this is a case where I should exercise my discretion. \"I believed the integrity of the process and the quality of the individual would be sufficient to rule out the reality or perception of nepotism or corruption. \"I can assure you that I stand as strong as ever against them.\" The staff association memo points out that, in the past, several staff members have had jobs denied to family members expressly because of the bank's internal rules and that others have been fired when it became known that they had broken it. Accusing the bank of only applying the rules to \"little people\" and not \"to those in positions of power\", it says: \"Dual standards of this kind simply cannot be part of the bank.\" It goes on to commend Mr Wolfensohn for taking a strong stand against corruption but complains that the appointment of Prof Stern undermines the bank's credibility when dealing with developing countries. \"Nepotism is, of course, a part of corruption. Many of the staff who have communicated with the staff association on this issue believe the appointment of Mr Stern easily lends itself to a perception of nepotism and corruption in the bank . . . The staff association must express its deep disappointment that the bank group management and the board approved this appointment. The association believes it must disassociate itself from this appointment because it represents a flagrant disregard for very important and time-tested rules on the bank. \"It also believes that as this appointment stands it will badly tarnish the image of the bank, threaten the bank by exposing staff to pressure on appointments of relatives, and ultimately demean the ability of staff to speak in a credible way with clients about corruption and hamper our work on issues of governance.\"",

The move comes in the wake of this week's flurry of deals which BP continued yesterday with a fresh clutch of transactions designed to placate American regulators and smooth the path for a formal go-ahead of its \u00a317bn take-over of rival American oil group Atlantic Richfield by early next month. Announcing a $1.3bn deal to buy out minority shareholders in Vastar, one of the largest independent oil and gas producers in the US, where Arco al ready has 82%, and at the same time selling off one of Arco's key storage terminals for $355m, BP Amoco's chief executive, Sir John Browne, said the company was now at an advanced stage in \"constructive\" discussions with the US federal trade commission. The FTC was blocking the Arco takeover which was first announced a year ago, and the whole matter looked set to end up in the courts before this week's deal to sell Arco's Alaskan assets to America's Phillips Petroleum for $7bn. Completing the Arco takeover will produce a company capitalised at around billion. The Amoco brand will continue to be used on forecourts in the US, while the Castrol brand will become the primary name for BP's lubricants after this weeks' \u00a33bn deal to acquire Burmah Castrol. BP executives say the shield logo is too \"oily\"; image consultants are working on a replacement suitable for the petrol fore courts of the future, where BP expects to be selling a range of products other than fuel. BP is overhauling pay structures for directors which will see a large portion of rewards linked to the company's performance in relation to an index of 100 global companies. BP's annual report, published today discloses that Sir John's package of salary and bonuses jumped from $1.5m to $2.35m last year, but on top of this he is also in line for an award of shares worth $4m later this year. From here, a new long-term incentive plan now being introduced will deliver shares worth another $8m if fresh performance targets are met through until 2002.",

      "bodyText": "France's flag carrier yesterday emerged as the frontrunner to take over British Airways' loss-making regional airline Air Libert\u00e9. Air France confirmed it was in talks with BA, saying directors had met to \"examine the possibility\" of taking over its smaller rival. Sources within the airline said the acquisition of Air Libert\u00e9 would enable it to expand and diversify its services in France and its overseas territories. The move would be a triumph for Air France which is caught in a three-way dogfight with the Swiss-based regional carrier, AOM, and Air Libert\u00e9 for the skies over France. Air France was reported to have offered BA nearly \u00a370m to acquire the ailing airline. Insiders say Air France's offer was \u00a330m more than AOM put on the table. Analysts pointed out that deal would see the former state monopoly strengthen its position at Orly airport, occupying 65% of take off and landing slots at Paris's second airport. At present Air Libert\u00e9, which employs some 2,500 people, faces tough competition from Air France and AOM, which is 49.5% owned by SAirGroup, the Switzerland-based aviation grouping that includes Swissair, Crossair, Sabena, LOT in Poland, Tap Air Portugal and a 20% stake in South African Airways. Earlier this month, SAirGroup retracted a statement which said it was holding talks with BA about buying a stake in Air Libert\u00e9. BA too stands to gain as Air Libert\u00e9 has proved an expensive drain on resources at the \"world's favourite airline\". Union representatives at Air Libert\u00e9 were expecting a round of economy measures, including the replacement of the airline's 11 Fokker 100 regional jets and four older F28s, and the closure of its route from Paris Orly to Nantes, which suffers competition from high-speed train services. BA's French division has been embarrassed by the success of the company's German airline, BA Deutsche, which is close to breaking even. According to the French financial daily newspaper Les Echos, Air Libert\u00e9 lost Fr680m (\u00a364m) in 1997-98 and Fr250m in 1998-99. In the year which ends this month, it is expected to lose a further Fr300m, after being hurt by the strength of the dollar and the rise in aviation fuel prices. Meanwhile, British airports operator BAA said that it had sold down its holdings in airport hotels for a \u00a340m windfall. But the group, which owned eight British hotels outright, made clear the move was not a retreat from hotel investment. BAA has sold the eight hotels into a partnership, or fund, for \u00a3187m, leaving it with a 10.1% beneficial interest. The remaining interest is held by four partners: Scottish Widows, the Coal Schemes, Shell Pension Fund and an unnamed overseas investor. BAA said the partnership, to be managed by BAA for a fee, would pursue further investment opportunities in airport hotels.",

At the same time, a fresh wave of money poured into technology stocks sending the Nasdaq composite index soaring and illustrating once again that US investors at least do not see any threat to the so-called new economy from rising oil prices and a likely increase in interest rates. At the close in New York yesterday, the Dow Jones was 499.19 points higher at 10,630.6, building dramatically on the 320-point gain seen on Wednesday producing a gain of almost 8.5% in the space of 48 hours. While the advance on the Dow earlier this week saw a corresponding slump on Nasdaq as investors switched funds out of internet-related stocks and into \"old economy\" blue chips, the technology-rich Nasdaq composite jumped nearly 3% to 4,717.29 points yesterday - bringing to an end three days of losses which have seen almost 10% wiped off this index. Before the latest rebound, the Dow had fallen almost 15% since the beginning of the year despite the fact that it now includes both software giants Microsoft and chip maker Intel. Nasdaq, meanwhile, was up almost 25% before the \"rotation\" back from new to old economy investments began. Wall Street analysts noted that American retail investors, as a breed, have become pro grammed over the past four years of the bull market to \"buy on the dips\" - rushing into the market whenever prices go through a correction. There were widespread predictions yesterday that the narrowing of the performance gap between the Dow and Nasdaq indices would soon resume, given the appalling performance over the past year by such stalwart US companies as Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Coca-Cola. But despite the corrective trend, the extraordinary volatility of the markets is bound to set off fresh alarm bells within the US Federal Reserve as the central bank's chairman, Alan Greenspan, prepares to raise borrowing costs once again in an attempt to cool the roaring economy. The authorities have made no secret of the way in which they fear that a casino mentality has developed in the US equity markets - a perception which will not have been altered by the vigour with which the country's army of online stock market speculators are now rushing into the Dow's constituents. The divergence between old and new economy stocks in the US has been labelled the \"split market\". This has been mirrored in the British market where companies such as mobile chips designer ARM Holdings and palm top computer maker Psion have leapfrogged long established companies, such as cigarette maker Imperial Tobacco and drinks group Allied Domecq, into the main FTSE 100 index.",

It is an ensemble picture like Tarantino's Pulp Fiction or Altman's Short Cuts but, with the device of a deadpan prologue about the nature of coincidence, makes manifest the curious nature of its own very individual world. It is an excursion into the universe of Ripley's Believe-It-Or-Not urban myth that prepares us - just about - for the uproarious biblical finale with which Anderson spectacularly discharges the unbearable tension and anxiety which has built up over the preceding three hours. </p> <p>Among the characters are Earl Partridge (Jason Robards), a wealthy television producer, very ill and breathing his last: grouchy, unpleasant, in a lot of pain and profoundly unreconciled to his impending death. He is attended by Phil, a male nurse played by Philip Seymour Hoffman - an actor whose name on the billboard always demands attention. As it happens, this is a reserved and almost reticent performance by Hoffman, who is the only character not eaten up with angst and self-doubt. </p> <p>Earl is also attended by his young wife, Linda, played with raw anger and self-loathing by Julianne Moore. Linda is experiencing a horrifying emotional about-face in her relations with Earl: she married him, lovelessly, for money but now realises she has actually fallen in love with him. She has been surprised, not by joy, but by the most terrible anguish. </p> <p>Earl produced a long-running TV general knowledge quiz show of stupendous awfulness called What Do Kids Know?, which pits a team of grown-ups against kid prodigies and is an inspired metaphor for the inter-generational incomprehension and rancour that pervades the film. The quizmaster himself is Jimmy Gator, played by the incomparable Philip Baker Hall, whose face has solidified like lumps and rivulets of molten lava into the weary face he now presents to the world: wrecked and ruined and haggard (there is actually a clever sequence showing the show's gestation, and showing Gator getting older), and grotesquely inappropriate to the icky, perky little catchphrases the show has accumulated over the years. </p> <p>Perhaps the outstanding performance is Tom Cruise as Earl's estranged son, the deliciously slimy Frank Mackey, a \"motivational speaker\" who runs a series of sex-advice seminars which are simply Nuremberg rallies for single guys. Entitled Seduce and Destroy, his sales pitch is a misogynist demagoguery, with individual lessons on \"How to Turn That 'Friend' Into a Sperm Receptacle\" and his message is that women must be subjected and humiliated before they do it to you, and that all sexual relations must be put on a permanent war footing. </p> <p>With the slogan \"Respect the Cock and Tame the Cunt\", Cruise is a mixture of Hugh Hefner, Billy Graham and Adolf Hitler, and this strutting, ranting creation is something to put alongside the brutish Chad in Neil LaBute's In the Company of Men or Matthew Broderick's nice teacher Mr McAllister in Alexander Payne's Election. Once again, it shows that in American cinema and culture, sexual relations have, in a sense, become the new cold war. (Frank is evidently a magnification of real life sex hucksters, but it cannot be long before someone starts Seduce and Destroy for real. I suggest Paul Thomas Anderson copyrights and suppresses the whole horribly catchy idea the way anti-racist groups have bagged \"hate.com\".) </p> <p>The poetic keynote to the film comes from Earl's grizzled death-bed lament about \"the goddam regret\". Don't be afraid to regret, he says, \"use that regret any way you want.\" Magnolia is a dark and bitter poetry of regret, enunciated in a theatre of regret, in the grammar of regret, and clothed in the style and rhetoric of regret. It is a great wail of regret, with the terrible admission that real lives can be played out in a drama of anguish and waste, and that looking this full in the face at the end requires existential courage of the sort few of us have. </p> <p>Magnolia is a sprawling, howling miasma of strangeness, and some may find incontinence and indiscipline in its sheer length and Anderson's love of bringing the soundtrack up to ear-bashing levels over the dialogue - particularly in the opening 10 to 15 minutes.

Jonze and Kaufman take us on a cheeky raid behind the enemy lines of thinkability in the cinema, into the realm of the six impossible things the Red Queen believed before breakfast. </p> <p>John Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, a sweaty, unshaven puppeteer, miserably resentful that no one appreciates his street theatre art, and forced to ply his trade in New York's uncaring thoroughfares. Finally compelled to find a day job, he becomes a lowly filing clerk on a bizarre, secret quasi-mezzanine floor of a skyscraper, a place where the ceilings are four feet high and everyone goes about their business bent double. Here Craig meets and falls abjectly in lust with the mysterious Maxine, instantly forgetting about his homely wife, Lotte, a pet shop attendant who brings home sick parrots and conflicted chimps. </p> <p>It is one of this film's sly reversals and pre-emptive strikes that it is Cameron Diaz who is cast as the dowdy wife - with \"no-make-up\" make-up and unflattering perm - while Catherine Keener is the other woman, her innate sexiness effortlessly surviving having to walk around like Groucho Marx. </p> <p>Their three lives are changed by the discovery of this magic portal, the door that leads into the consciousness of one of the grooviest, classiest, campest celebrities on the block. For a Warholian 15-minute session, they can see what Malkovich sees, feel what Malkovich feels; they experience him sorting through his mail, ordering a new periwinkle-blue shade of bathmat in that fluting, mellifluous voice - before they are ejected ecstatically onto a grass verge by the New Jersey turnpike.</p> <p>The film effects a terrifying mise-en-ab\u00eeme when John furiously discovers what is going on and demands to go through the door himself into his own mind, with astonishing results. But not before Lotte has discovered she kinkily enjoys being John Malkovich while he is having actual-reality sex with Maxine: \"It's as if the portal is vaginal,\" breathes Lotte wonderingly. \"It shows John's feminine side.\" </p> <p>This film comes as close as it is possible to get to a sustained nirvana of giggling, a hovering delirium of comedy. It's like breathing in nitrous oxide, making you feel liable at any moment to float away. It has a Woody Allen-ish quality - and Cusack's performance is not that far from his lead in Bullets Over Broadway - but not so much Allen's films as the playful short stories. It has something of the F Anstey of Vice Versa, and the Gore Vidal of Myra Breckinridge and Myron, and also a little of The Truman Show and EDtv. </p> <p>Being John Malkovich brings a light touch to the important things it says about the ballooning cult of celebrity, how the aristocracy of the famous bombards us with gilded, gorgeous lives and hyper-real existences from every screen - subtly encouraging us to believe not merely in the inferiority of the non-famous existence, but its relative unreality. And in doing so, it returns us to the childlike reverie, as we look down at our hands, arms, and the tapering perspective of our bodies, of what it is like to be someone else. And further, to wondering what it is to be ourselves. </p> <p>The choice of John Malkovich himself is inspired: he treats the role with a sporting lack of pomposity and yet absolute seriousness.

      "bodyText": "Britain's shops and stores suffered a post-millennium hangover last month as consumers stayed away from the high street and caused the sharpest drop in retail sales for more than 18 months. With prices recovering a little after discounting in the winter sales, retailers saw the volume of sales drop by 1.2% in January following two months in which the pace of spending had prompted fears of a rerun of the late 1980s boom. Some sectors of the high street posted small increases in sales volumes, with department stores reporting volumes up by almost 1%. However, the price war among supermarkets failed to prevent a 0.9% decline in food sales, while outlets selling household goods recorded a 3.7% decline in business. In the three months to February, thought a better guide to the underlying trend than one month's figures, the volume of retail sales was 1.8% higher than in the previous quarter and 5.5% up on the same three months a year earlier. The figures from the offiice for national statistics showed that spending growth had returned to the levels seen last autumn, with little signs so far that the four increases in base rates since September are having much impact on an environment in which consumer confidence is strong and the housing market in parts of the country is surging. City analysts had been expecting some reaction to the spending spree around the turn of the year, but were surprised by the extent of the fall. However, some still believe that the underlying strength of demand will persuade the Bank of England's monetary policy committee to raise interest rates further. Mervyn King, the deputy governor of the Bank warned following news of January's 1.6% jump in sales that it was important not to pay too much attention to one month's data, but Michael Saunders, economist with Salomon Smith Barney Citibank said the recent surveys from the CBI and the British Retail Consortium, together with the weekly returns from the John Lewis Partnership suggested that the trend in retail sales remained strong. David Coleman, at CIBC world markets, said that even though prices in the shops had rebounded last month they were still 1.5% lower last month than they were in February 1999, an indication of the strong competitive pressure in the high street.",

      "body": "<p>Lloyd's, the insurance market, yesterday hit back in court at allegations that it operated a 10-year fraud to suck in new investors and fleece them for billions of pounds. </p> <p>QC Charles Aldous poured scorn on the notion of a conspiracy and said some of those now suing the market had been \"innocently and unnecessarily\" drawn into the case. Opening the Lloyd's defence in the high court, Mr Aldous said there was no evidence to support claims that senior market figures had tried to recruit new investors - known as \"names\" - in the 1970s and 1980s in order to land them with the bill for \u00a34bn of asbestos-related insurance claims. </p> <p>\"There was no such misrepresentation, let alone fraudulent,\" he told Mr Justice Cresswell.

      "bodyText": "Lloyd's, the insurance market, yesterday hit back in court at allegations that it operated a 10-year fraud to suck in new investors and fleece them for billions of pounds. QC Charles Aldous poured scorn on the notion of a conspiracy and said some of those now suing the market had been \"innocently and unnecessarily\" drawn into the case. Opening the Lloyd's defence in the high court, Mr Aldous said there was no evidence to support claims that senior market figures had tried to recruit new investors - known as \"names\" - in the 1970s and 1980s in order to land them with the bill for \u00a34bn of asbestos-related insurance claims. \"There was no such misrepresentation, let alone fraudulent,\" he told Mr Justice Cresswell. Far from hiding the truth about asbestos claims from the market, Lloyd's set up a \"top level working party\" and circulated its findings to hundreds of insurance syndicates. \"There is no basis for alleging any information was withheld from the market,\" he said. \"Many of those [senior Lloyd's figures] wrongly alleged to have been dishonest in this case lost a substantial amount of money . . . and they did so on the very same syndicates.

The coda of the Fourth Symphony's first movement was a breathtaking combination of fire and finesse. The VPO has Brahms's complex syncopations in its blood, so each voice, from the thunderous basses to the peals of timpani, was clearly focused within the overall screwing-up of contrapuntal tension. At the end of Ozawa's stately second movement, the cellos' shaping of Brahms's rippling arpeggios was the kind of moment of isolated brilliance that comes from years - centuries - of dynamic tradition. Even without the profoundest of insights from its conductor, the VPO, in this repertoire, still provides the richest of orchestral experiences. </p> <p>***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible</p>",
