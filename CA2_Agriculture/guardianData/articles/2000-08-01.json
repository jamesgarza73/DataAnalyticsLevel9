Management had called for sales staff to win 60 sales a week of Barclaycards, graduate loans and insurance policies - or face disciplinary action, according to documents obtained by the Guardian. The bank - which tomorrow will report profits of around \u00a31.7bn - was attacked by consumer groups, saying such pressure could lead to customers being sold products they did not need. The memo from managers of the south-east London group of Barclays branches says different versions of its \"minimum performance standards\" are being introduced throughout the bank's 79 districts. Under the heading \"Under-performance\", the circular warns that failure will be met with a written warning followed by a final written warning and then dismissal. An alternative to leaving the company could be demotion or salary reduction, the document explains. In a list of questions and answers about the scheme introduced on July 8, Barclays says: \"It is recognised that everyone has the odd blip here or there, so providing it is not a consistent theme ... nothing more than an informal one-to-one will take place with your team leader-manager. \"However, should underper formance be evident in more than one week in four the process in the 'underperformance' section of this communication will be followed.\" Last night Barclays disowned the staff circular, blaming local managers for breaking company policy on minimum performance standards.

      "bodyText": "House prices fell again in July, providing further evidence that the housing boom is over, according to figures issued yesterday which show that London - the region which led the upturn - is now seeing the biggest slowdown. The cost of an average home fell 0.2% in July and now stands at \u00a381,133 - down \u00a3319 on the previous month, said Nationwide building society. This is the second decline in three months and means prices are back to where they were in May, when the average cost of a home was \u00a381,006. The society's findings coincide with a report from the widely respected economist Roger Bootle, which concludes that after three decades of dramatic ups and downs the housing market \"may be reaching something like stability\". According to the Nationwide the rate of annual house price growth is continuing to fall - it was 13.9% in July compared with 15.1% in June and 17.5% in April. However, it is argued that a property crash is unlikely, and even held out some hope that with the economy being strong, the housing market could merely be \"pausing for breath\". \"The housing market continued to cool in July,\" said David Parry at the Nationwide. \"Regionally, it appears that prices in London have seen the most significant slowdown.\" Part of the explanation for the market's weakening is that the dramatic price rises of the last 12 months were not sustainable, resulting in growing numbers of first time buyers being priced out of the market, he added. An average first time buyer in the capital would need to earn more than \u00a332,000 and be able to find a deposit of perhaps \u00a312,550 in order to buy a typical first time buyer property costing \u00a3125,540.

Our schools will become teched-up beacons of learning, our hospitals icons of speed, equity and compassion. We will travel quickly along gleaming rail lines and open highways. Our new expensively-equipped military will be feared across the globe. </p> <p>Except for one tiny, niggling detail. Money can buy you stuff, Gordon - and for that, heartfelt thanks - but you also need people to run that stuff and people are what our public services lack. </p> <p>High-calibre staff are thin on the ground. Over the past 20 years, there has been a dramatic reversal in the attractiveness of jobs for HM government versus those in the private sector, and a corresponding fall in the quantity and quality of applicants in many areas. Who will run our shiny new public sector? Right now, it is struggling to inspire its existing staff, let alone hire new ones. </p> <p>Teaching is the worst example. To be a teacher used to mean a certain position in the community. Today many teachers lie about their jobs at dinner parties to avoid accusations of militancy, laziness or an inability to cope in the \"real world\". If they hear: \"If you can, do; if you can't, teach!\" one more time, blood will be spilt. </p> <p>However, it is a hard fact that the quality of graduates choosing teaching as a career has declined.

      "bodyText": "Britain's public sector will shortly be awash with cash, following Gordon Brown's bumper handout. Our schools will become teched-up beacons of learning, our hospitals icons of speed, equity and compassion. We will travel quickly along gleaming rail lines and open highways. Our new expensively-equipped military will be feared across the globe. Except for one tiny, niggling detail. Money can buy you stuff, Gordon - and for that, heartfelt thanks - but you also need people to run that stuff and people are what our public services lack. High-calibre staff are thin on the ground. Over the past 20 years, there has been a dramatic reversal in the attractiveness of jobs for HM government versus those in the private sector, and a corresponding fall in the quantity and quality of applicants in many areas. Who will run our shiny new public sector? Right now, it is struggling to inspire its existing staff, let alone hire new ones. Teaching is the worst example. To be a teacher used to mean a certain position in the community. Today many teachers lie about their jobs at dinner parties to avoid accusations of militancy, laziness or an inability to cope in the \"real world\". If they hear: \"If you can, do; if you can't, teach!\" one more time, blood will be spilt. However, it is a hard fact that the quality of graduates choosing teaching as a career has declined. While teaching once seemed a natural choice for the intellectually gifted, teacher-training college sightings of anyone with a first-class degree are now rare and cold, hard cash is a big part of the reason. The difference between private and public sector wage packets has grown wider over the years. Nursing, too, is struggling to attract the staff needed.

      "body": "<p>Stressed, pressured, irritable in the office? Perhaps making some compost would help. Highly intelligent but weak on the practical side of getting things done at work? Maybe you're a silty type of person; silt is a fine-textured fertile earth but can easily become clogged with water. Demotivated, miserable, not fulfilling your potential? Your ground condition could be poor. And if you're simply exhausted, like a field that has been overcultivated, then a fallow period for renewal could make you productive again. </p> <p>All these farming analogies may seem far removed from the world of the office but Alan Heeks, author of The Natural Advantage: Renewing Yourself (just published by Nicholas Brealey Publishing, \u00a312.99), insists that they are not. Taking an organic farm as a model for working life is very effective, he says. \"Most blueprints for industries and organisations are highly mechanistic, but people are more like a natural resource than a mechanism. A working organic farm is an example of the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources.\" </p> <p>It is an example Heeks is keen to impress upon those who attend the workshops he runs at a 132-acre organic farm in the Axe Valley on the Somerset/Dorset border. They get a shock when they are prised out of their suits and told to get their wellingtons on and their hands dirty. \"I want everyone to feel what healthy organic soil feels like,\" Heeks says. </p> <p>The reason? Every technique used in organic farming has its office equivalent, he says. \"Composting is a good example. Consider the way material waste is handled: we don't like to look at it, we bury it in the ground and pretend it's gone. But landfill sites come back as ground pollution. Human energy waste comes in the form of stress, conflict and pressure. Burying it doesn't help resolve it.\" </p> <p>Recognising these waste issues is the first step, he says, like a farmer building a visible compost heap. A healthy heap needs turning regularly and the way to deal with composting in humans is to look at the problems and learn from them. \"It's not about beating yourself up over something that has gone wrong but thinking about it and harvesting what you can for future development.\" </p> <p>As well as getting stuck into the compost heap, there are opportunities for those on the workshops to see all facets of the farm in action and to live off its produce. \"Seeing how the farm works and how it relates to the local community and the local economy shows people how you can recycle fertility and substitute wealth for fertility,\" says Christina Ballinger, coordinator at Magdalen Farm. </p> <p>Walking through one of the wheat fields at Magdalen is certainly a pleasant way to learn. A huge black and yellow dragonfly flutters by; the crop stems are interspersed with dock and tall daisies, but the wheat looks strong and healthy. Ballinger points out that in the surrounding, conventionally-farmed fields, the recent rainy weather has caused a lot of damage. \"The conventional crops are artificially boosted, so they are pushed on too fast and keel over in the rain.\" Magdalen's wheat is still standing. </p> <p>The farm is run by the Wessex Foundation, a charity of which Heeks is founder and trustee. It seems an unlikely move for a Harvard MBA who worked at Procter &amp; Gamble before becoming a co-founder and board director of the building materials group Caradon, described by one leading venture capitalist as \"the most successful management buy-in ever\". </p> <p>When he left Caradon in 1990 and dumped his XJ6 to found Magdalen Farm and start his own training company, Heeks realised the problems he was encountering in running the farm were not so far removed from the ones he was finding in the workplace. So he set out to put together a whole programme for sustainable working practice, using practical examples from the fields, woods and streams. </p> <p>An organic farmer, for instance, will allow his fields to recover between crop planting - people, Heeks says, need similar periods of renewal. Most of us will get short shrift if we tell a boss we can't meet a deadline because we're having a fallow period but Heeks explains that putting this into practice can be as simple as alternating demanding tasks with simpler ones. </p> <p>Parallels can also be drawn between soil and a company's staff. Just as the organic farmer works with different soil types in different ways to produce crops, a good manager should tailor his techniques according to the kind of person he's working with. Heeks divides people up into sandy, silt, clay, loam, chalk and peat, each of which has strengths and weaknesses. Sandy soils, for example, are open-textured and water and organic matter drain through fast. Basic fertility is low but sandy soils can be highly fertile if plenty of organic matter is added. \"This equates to people who are potentially fiery and creative but lack follow-through and stamina; they need frequent top-ups of fertility and good composting to avoid burn-out.\" </p> <p> This is all very well in theory but in practice, what do corporate visitors to the farm make of such comparisons? \"Being in the middle of a dynamic natural cycle has a subtle effect,\" Heeks says. \"You realise that all aspects of the farm are interrelated and interdependent, that they all interchange with each other. It's an approach managers who have done the course are enthusiastic about.\" </p> <p>David Carey, vice president of the Wessex branch of the Institute of Management, says: \"Being on the farm, away from normal frames of reference, was a great stimulus. All the way through my career as a manager, I've tried to treat people in such a way as to help them get the most out of their jobs. That ties in with Alan's work on ground conditioning and preparation.\" </p> <p>Andy Middleton, who runs his own coaching companies, agrees. \"I think this approach really does stack up. The organic system is chaotic, it doesn't have neat edges, and that's reassuring because that's the way my own business developed. This isn't quick-fix training.\" </p> <p>But could the workshops be no more than an excuse for a few days of good food in beautiful surroundings? What differentiates them from a whole host of gimmicky training courses? For Middleton, it's the sincerity behind them. \"Alan Heeks isn't doing it to make lots of money or to satisfy an ego need - he's been there and done that. He's communicating a message he thinks needs to be communicated.\" </p> <p>For Heeks, it's the fact that \"the principles of sustainable development are fundamental to life on earth. I'm surprised no one has looked at how this affects people before - there has been plenty of work on the environmental crisis but none on how sustainability relates to humans. Using the natural model isn't a way of dressing ideas up to make them more interesting - the farm came first and was translated into the book.\" Revenue from the book and the workshops is yet another crop to be ploughed back into the farm, which also runs training courses for local young people, residential stays for special needs groups and educational programmes for schools. </p> <p>It is, Ballinger says, difficult to quantify the success of the workshops in conventional terms. \"We don't set targets or performance indicators for people who come. All you can do is look at testimonials. And people do feel different at the end of the course. You learn that the bottom line isn't the bottom line.\" </p> <p>Alan Heeks can be contacted on 01794 388707 or via <a href=\"http://www.thenaturaladvantage.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.thenaturaladvantage.com</a>.</p>",

However, Koopman has bucked the trend by trusting that Bach would have re-used other compositions of his apart from the Funeral Ode. After all, he had a large enough body of work to draw on by the time he came to write his St Mark Passion in 1731. </p> <p>For this reason, one would imagine Koopman's version would be the most satisfying. Yet, while there is no doubting Koopman's devotion to the music, Bach's generous spirit for the most part did not come over in this performance. Until a welcome orchestral breakthrough late in the first half, Koopman's selection of music encompassed some of Bach's more thinly scored and sparing numbers.

But one longed for the musical imagery of the St Matthew. The tenderness of Bach's settings of Jesus's words, with their \"halo\" of strings, was largely absent from Koopman's reconstructed recitatives.

That's what Universal Pictures confirmed this weekend as Eddie Murphy's Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps opened across America. Impersonating six characters, Murphy doesn't just slip into a frock - he straps on bras, girdles and droopy tights. All of which resulted in an estimated weekend gross of $42.7m and a shot at the $129m domestic haul of the original Nutty Professor. John Travolta (Battlefield Earth) and Robert De Niro (The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle) may be sinking this summer, but black talent is thriving. </p> <p>The sleeper hit of the season in the US is Dimension Films' Scary Movie, a lecherous deconstruction of its own Scream series that opened to a record-shattering $42m; it may eventually gross $140m or more. The film, which belongs to director Keenen Ivory Wayans, along with his screenwriter/actor brothers Shawn and Marlon, has become the biggest hit, by far, by any black director. The fact that it isn't a \"black\" movie per se - its gross-out humour is aimed at slasher-movie tropes, not racial issues - makes it even more of a landmark achievement, albeit a low-rent one. </p> <p>Earlier this summer, Martin Lawrence - until now, the poor man's Eddie Murphy - did a little cross-dressing of his own. The result, Big Momma's House, was a surprise hit for 20th Century Fox, coasting to a very profitable $115m. For African-American Hollywood, 2000 is turning out to be a breakthrough year. When the box-office dust settles, Hollywood will have to think twice before restricting black performers and directors to what the industry euphemistically refers to as \"urban movie-goers\". </p> <p>Before Wayans, only a handful of black directors had headed major projects that didn't deal specifically with African-American themes. The notable exceptions were actor-turned-director Forest Whitaker, who scored a hit with 1995's Waiting to Exhale, and was entrusted with the Sandra Bullock romance Hope Floats in 1998; and, in the same year, F Gary Gray, who notched up a modest success with the thriller The Negotiator, starring Kevin Spacey and Samuel L Jackson. Now Wayans has leapfrogged over all of them, and is able to lay claim to any material - at least, any broad comedy material - he wants. </p> <p>Black directors have been generating cash this summer in other genres too. John Singleton has racked up a solid $68m to date with his recycling of Shaft. All of which suggests that moviegoers are a lot more inclusive than Hollywood generally gives them credit for. Sadly, when the studios turn out specifically black-themed movies - and pitch them primarily to that \"urban\" audience - they quickly hit a wall. This spring, the New Line romance Love &amp; Basketball sputtered out after collecting just $27m; and last year, Universal's buppie drama The Best Man stalled out at $34m. If a movie appears to be about black people, its appeal is limited; but if marketing forces can convince moviegoers that it's about something else - like, say, funny cop goes under cover - its black milieu doesn't necessarily prevent it finding a larger audience. </p> <p>\"The business worries that if you do a 'black' movie, it won't break out, but if you make something with mass appeal, it will,\" contends Big Momma's House co-producer David Higgins. </p> <p>When African-American screenwriter Darryl Quarles first pitched the project, he argued the movie's gimmick wasn't drag so much as its setting - a matriarchal society in which big mommas rule. </p> <p>\"In terms of our audience polling,\" explains Higgins, \"we knew Martin had a strong following in the African-American community. But the next tier group that really responded to it were women from 45 to 60, regardless of race. And the element that surprised us were pre-teenagers, from eight to 12.

      "body": "<p>Cricket, like no other game, can be compellingly quirky and, to the outsider, irrational. Here two players, Michael Bevan and Mark Ramprakash, have paraded skills and refinements to transport this fixture into a memory to be cherished. </p> <p>Yet neither, with a remarkable irony, is considered to be of Test match calibre. Both are marginalised: for reasons of dubious technique against seriously fast bowling in one case and, we assume, temperament in the other. </p> <p>Yesterday, on this delectable parkland ground, Bevan scored his fourth hundred in five innings. He was still there on 173 not out, mocking any attempt to remove him, when Sussex won by seven wickets to take them to the top of the Second Division. </p> <p>Bevan is lethal when the ball is anywhere in line with his pads. His feet belong to Astaire and he needs only a top hat to complete the illusion. There is a simplicity about the left-hander's batsmanship, based on sublime timing.

      "bodyText": "Cricket, like no other game, can be compellingly quirky and, to the outsider, irrational. Here two players, Michael Bevan and Mark Ramprakash, have paraded skills and refinements to transport this fixture into a memory to be cherished. Yet neither, with a remarkable irony, is considered to be of Test match calibre. Both are marginalised: for reasons of dubious technique against seriously fast bowling in one case and, we assume, temperament in the other. Yesterday, on this delectable parkland ground, Bevan scored his fourth hundred in five innings. He was still there on 173 not out, mocking any attempt to remove him, when Sussex won by seven wickets to take them to the top of the Second Division. Bevan is lethal when the ball is anywhere in line with his pads. His feet belong to Astaire and he needs only a top hat to complete the illusion. There is a simplicity about the left-hander's batsmanship, based on sublime timing. The shots are clean; he is sharp and calculating enough to be able to adapt at the last moment to the turning ball. Yet in truth the Walker Ground revealed a capricious streak and spun less on this final day. Records often suggest Bevan is the best one-day player in the world. His technique is vigilant, carrying few risks. He hit 21 fours and three sixes here, facing only 191 balls, and Australia understandably see him as a key limited-overs batsman. But is he destined to slip away from Test consideration? Yesterday it seemed an absurdity. Just before lunch he stepped out to hit Phil Tufnell deep into the upper branches beyond long-on.

      "bodyText": "Chile's supreme court met today to decide whether General Augusto Pinochet should lose his immunity from prosecution over human rights abuses linked to his 1973-90 dictatorship. As the court's 20 justices entered the second floor room in the century-old building, small but noisy groups of followers and foes of Pinochet exchanged insults across the street where police had blocked traffic. Even if the court removes Pinochet's immunity today it remains unclear whether the figure who so dramatically divides Chilean society would ever face trial. The court was deciding on Pinochet's appeal of a lower tribunal ruling stripping him of his congressional immunity from prosecution. During a brief break of the closed-door session, court secretary Carlos Meneses said that it was not clear whether the judges would reach agreement on a ruling today and if they did, an announcement would probably take three or for days to allow one of the judges to write the legal text containing the ruling. But one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs, Hugo Gutierrez, said he \"definitely; expected a decision to be announced today. There is no appeal to the supreme court decision. Relatives of victims of repression under Gen Pinochet's 1973-90 dictatorship and leading leftwing politicians awaited anxiously in the court's corridors as the judges met. \"We are convinced he will lose his immunity and justice will finally be possible,\" said Mireya Garcia, whose brother disappeared after being arrested under Gen Pinochet. The former dictator faces 154 criminal complaints, and Judge Juan Guzman is seeking his trial in one of them, the so-called \"caravan of death: a military squad that summarily executed 72 political prisoners in several cities shortly after Pinochet's bloody 1973 coup. Even if the court rules against Gen Pinochet, Mr Gutierrez said he was not sure if he would immediately seek an indictment. He said he felt the case might never come to trial because it is so sensitive and could drag on in the courts. In an interview published Monday in the newspaper La Segunda, Mr Gutierrez hinted that if the court ruled against Gen Pinochet today that might be enough. \"I do not see Pinochet going to jail. In fact, I would be happy seeing him stripped of his immunity,\" he said. If the immunity is lifted, one factor that could cause long delays in legal proceedings is the issue of Gen Pinochet's medical condition. Since he is older than 70, he must be given medical tests to determine if he is fit to stand trial.

If Gen Pinochet refuses the test, that would leave Judge Guzman facing the legal question of whether he can try a defendant without the required medical examination. Gen Pinochet suffers from diabetes, carries a pacemaker and sustained three mild strokes during his 16-month house arrest in London, which ended last March. He had been arrested on a warrant by a Spanish judge wanting to try him, but was released after British doctors determined he was mentally and physically unfit to stand trial.

I will be consulting widely on this and hope to produce some guidance for them in due course. \"In the meantime, the Prime Minister and his family are leaving for a holiday at the end of the week and Downing Street has asked me for guidance in relation to this. They have made clear that whilst they continue to have serious reservations about putting their children in the public eye, the Prime Minister and Mrs Blair are willing to organise a one-off photocall before they continue the rest of their holiday in private. \"It seems to me that the most constructive way to strike the balance between legitimate privacy and legitimate public interest in photos of the family is for them to undertake this photocall during the first few days of their holiday. Number Ten agrees with me on this - and we hope that after the photocall has taken place the family will be able to complete its holiday in private. I know that editors will be happy to respect that wish in line with the terms of the Code of Practice, including its stipulations on the use of freelance photographs. \"Operational details relating to the photocall will be issued by Number Ten in due course.\"",

Ann Widdecombe mum123 - I do seriously think that the Tories can win the next election and that we will do so, if we have the right policies. There is a widespread recognition that Labour promised the earth and delivered very little, so we must make sure that we only promise what we are sure we can deliver.

Ann Widdecombe A000457 - On long train trips and on holiday! bat020 Your party's policy and media tactics on asylum seekers clearly appeal to racists and give a tacit green light to the far right. Is this simply an unfortunate coincidence, or are you actively seeking out the racist vote, or is it just a case of you being happy to passively collaborate with bigotry? Ann Widdecombe bat020 - I do not believe that our policy on asylum seekers is either bigoted or racist. It is designed to help the genuine asylum seeker stuck in a queue with 100,000 others, most of whom have no case to stay.

Ms Denman has yet to deliver her final report, but her preliminary report in May found \"strong prima facie evidence that some forms of race discrimination and institutional racism have operated\". Of the Croydon branch she said: \"Substantial segregation between the two prosecution teams along racial lines appears to have emerged and persisted over several years. One team has remained predominantly white, while the other is racially mixed.\" Evidence had been given by several staff of hostility from some on the predominantly white team towards black and Asian staff, \"a few of whom were thought to have been left with little choice but to seek transfer\", she said. \"It is unclear whether this problem has been recognised or acknowledged for what it is by senior management until very recently.\" The CRE said it had received information in June from two sources suggesting that racial segregation was persisting in Croydon. CPS officials had confirmed in June that \"there did appear to be a segregation issue in the Croydon office but could not explain what action had been taken to address it\". The investigation, into \"any unlawful acts which may have occurred between June 1990 and June 2000\", is expected to start in September. In February a tribunal awarded a lawyer, Maria Bamieh, a record \u00a330,000 for injury to feelings after finding that the CPS wanted \"to rub her face in the dirt\" after she complained of discrimination and victimisation. The tribunal said the service's conduct fell below the standard \"we would have expected of a corner shop\". Evidence emerged at the tribunal of complaints at Croydon about racist notes written on defendants' files by some prosecutors. One lawyer allegedly wrote that a defendant had \"played the race card\", that police were worried about a complaint but that the lawyer would support the police whatever the outcome of the case. A CPS spokeswoman said: \"We're going to cooperate with the CRE in any way they ask us to. We're anxious to find out where there are problems and do something about it. We recognise there is a problem.\"",

Because when young John had something to get off his chest - namely his proposed \u00a36.5m transfer to Leeds - he decided to eschew the oh-so-trendy world of the web today and use his mother Berit instead. Well, he is only 19.</p> <p>\"We have agreed John Arne's personal contract, and as far as I am concerned there are only formalities left before the deal goes through,\" Berit thundered earlier today before returning home to make John Arne some sandwiches. Little Johnny, meanwhile, was busy telling Norwegian newspaper VG that he was \"very excited. I am still very young and I think Leeds is the right place for me to develop into a better football player. I want to be a part of this young and ambitious team and I am confident that Leeds will win things.\"</p> <p>With the deadline for registering a player for Big Cup only around the corner, John Arne has brought in Rune Hauge (yes, George, that Rune Hauge) to make sure everything is finished smoothly.

Rather than dehumanising these people, surely we should support them by campaigning for the whole issue of paedophilia to be tackled more systematically? Naming and shaming is not right, but we need a major review of the workings of the agencies involved in the care of abused children - law, police and social workers - together with proper support for their families and the adequate supervision of people who probably can never be cured. comment@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>Doctors have talked for decades about developing a vaccine for cancer which would use the body's immune system to turn the tables on tumours; every few months we read about new trials being carried out in this field by scientists who pepper their speech with adjectives such as \"promising\", \"exciting\" and \"revolutionary\". </p> <p>Some have even made the tantalising prediction that cancer may soon be easily treatable by a simple injection. If so, where are these much-trumpeted vaccines? Even given the lengthy trial and approval period required for new treatments, surely some should have arrived on the market by now, especially as the idea has been knocking around since the 18th century, when Dr Tachon, a French physician, discovered the cancer-fighting benefits of \"laudable pus\". </p> <p>During the 1890s, Tachon's work was developed by William B Coley, a New York surgeon, who injected live bacteria into growing soft tissue tumours, some of which shrank after a brisk inflammatory response. </p> <p>Later doctors began to notice that some skin and kidney cancers spontaneously regress, the only explanation being that they are under attack by the patient's immune system. Some melanoma (skin cancer) patients also experience vitiligo, or loss of skin pigmentation, which is an auto-immune response to the skin's own melanin-producing cells. </p> <p>This may all sound encouraging, but the fact is that cancer, which comes in more than 200 forms and will affect one in three of us, is not even close to becoming a thing of the past. </p> <p>Vaccines may grab headlines, but vaccine research accounts for less than \u00a31m of the Cancer Research Campaign's \u00a361m annual research budget, and the traumatically traditional \"cut it, burn it, poison it\" therapies, which have hardly changed in the past 30 years, are still the best on offer. </p> <p>Even if, or when, vaccines do become a standard weapon in the oncologist's armoury, radio and chemotherapy will still be needed to shrink the tumour in the first place to improve chances of success. </p> <p>Dr David Miles, joint head of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund's breast cancer biology group, is leading a vaccine trial involving 900 breast cancer patients. He says: \"The idea of a vaccine is intellectually appealing, but this is an incredibly complex area, and it would be wrong to say we're on the brink of a breakthrough.\" He believes a vaccine is worth pursuing, however, because there is so little chance of further improvement in conventional therapies. </p> <p>Various types of vaccine are being developed, most of which use either tumour cells or antigens (proteins which \"mark\" the surface structure of the cell). </p> <p>The cells, sometimes taken from the patient's own tumour, are irradiated to kill them and then re-injected along with an agent to provoke a response from the immune system - similar to methods used by Coley more than a century ago. These cell vaccines, especially the individually tailored ones, can be complex and expensive to prepare. </p> <p>Antigen vaccines, however, are cheap and easy to mass produce, and are being developed with a view to treating pancreatic cancer, for example, which is nearly always caused by a specific antigen mutation. </p> <p>In Miles's trial, the vaccine, Theratope, attacks cancer cells by recognising a particular sugar which is only exposed in diseased cells. It is too early for the trial to be showing any survival benefits. </p> <p>One of the problems in developing vaccines, says Miles, is that cancer cells - despite their bizarre and uncontrolled behaviour - may still be similar to surrounding tissue, and may \"learn\" how to switch off the signals which should alert the immune system. </p> <p>Also, because there are \"demonstrably effective\" treatments already in use for some common cancers, such as breast cancer, it's difficult to justify testing anything new except in the most advanced cases where all else has failed. This is far from ideal, particularly as repeated chemo- therapy may have damaged the immune system to the extent where it cannot be stimulated by vaccines. </p> <p>\"Only patients with cancers such as melanoma, for whom conventional treatment is rarely effective, are being tested with vaccines in the early stages,\" he says. </p> <p>David Kerr, professor of clinical oncology at Birmingham University, is three months into a vaccine trial involving nine patients suffering from hepatoma, a liver cancer - rampant in the Middle East - which is sparked by hepatitis. \"Cancer vaccines were largely discredited in the 70s and 80s because at that time we didn't understand enough about the science of the immune system,\" he says. \"But now we're in a position to plan them better. It may seem that progress has been slow, but up until now, we've really been working on finding out how to make the vaccines work. </p> <p>\"Surgery is always going to be the mainstay of cancer treatment, but I believe the time for rational vaccines has come. We need massive trials involving thousands of people and five years down the road we will be able to measure the vaccines' success.\" </p> <p>More immediately promising is another type of vaccine - the only true vaccine, in the prophylactic sense. It attacks viruses, which have in recent years been implicated in up to 20% of all cancers and may be responsible for more. These include the human papilloma, or wart, virus, which causes 99% of cervical cancers, the human T-cell leukaemia virus, and the Epstein-Barr virus, which can cause glandular fever and is also associated with lymphoma and naso-pharyngeal cancer. </p> <p>The hepatitis B and C viruses can cause liver cancer - the commonest cancer worldwide. There is already a vaccine for hepatitis B, which in trials seems to protect the woodchuck - a burrowing rodent native to North America, also known as the groundhog - from liver cancer, and which may be responsible for falling cancer rates in Taiwan. There could also be a viral link to some breast cancers, while Kaposi's sarcoma, found in Aids patients, is caused by the cytomegalo virus and a herpes virus. </p> <p>Another much-vaunted trial area is genetic vaccines. These use disabled retroviruses from mice to introduce cancer-fighting genes into the immune system. Work is still at a very early stage, and has raised fears that the viruses could \"infect\" more than one type of cell with the genetic material, potentially causing other cancers, or permanently affecting future generations by ending up in egg or sperm cells. They could even be transmitted to other people or the environment. </p> <p>Miles, however, is \"cautiously optimistic\". \"It's hard enough to make a vaccine against a virus - and that's an obvious foreign agent,\" he says. \"If we can't even vaccinate against the common cold, it gives you some idea of how long it will be before we can routinely vaccinate for cancer.\" </p> <p>The idea has strong appeal for patients, however. \"They feel they can use their own immune systems to fight the disease, enabling them to take control in some way rather than being the recipient of an unpleasant treatment from doctors.\" </p> <p>Dee Merry, 54, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1995 and secondary liver cancer last year, is taking part in Miles's trial. \"Secondary cancer is treatable, but not curable,\" she says. \"So this certainly can't do me any harm. I believe very strongly in positive thinking and if vaccines are ever going to work, someone has to be involved in the trials. It's great to be involved in something that's going to help people in the future too.\" </p> <p>Dee, a former prison officer, says the vaccine injections in her thighs are like \"100 bee stings\" and cause extreme discomfort for a day or two. \"But it's worth it even if the cancer flares up again. At least it might build up my immune system to the point where I can put up the best possible fight.\" </p> <p>Miles says the most important weapon against cancer will continue to be improving understanding of the disease. \"Even though we may not be seeing anything spectacular just yet, there are incremental improvements,\" he says. \"With a disease as common as cancer, those improvements are important, and this is an area in which we cannot justify stopping work.\" </p> <p><strong>Vaccines: the state of play</strong></p> <p><strong> Genetic vaccines: </strong><br> US and French scientists have found a way of enabling the immune system to recognise an abnormal genetic structure called a telomere, which is switched on in 85% of cancer cells and allows them to grow and divide endlessly. A prototype genetic vaccine uses programmed white blood cells to attack cells with this abnormality and kill them before they grow into a tumour. </p> <p><strong> Breast cancer: </strong><br> Herceptin, an engineered antibody, recognises a surface abnormality in up to 30% of breast cancer cells and can induce remission. It is already licensed for use in the US and may soon be available in the UK. Scientists in New Orleans have isolated a virus associated with breast cancer. It is not contagious, but is in the genetic make-up of up to 30% of the population and almost identical to one identified as a cause of breast cancer in mice in 1942. Lead scientist Robert Garry says the virus was found in 85% of 30 breast cancer samples. </p> <p><strong> Cervical cancer: </strong><br> US scientists, with $3million in government funding, are using genetically modified tobacco to make a vaccine to protect against human papilloma virus. Cynics say the government is just trying to appease politically powerful, yet hard-pressed tobacco farmers in an election year. Other HPV vaccines are being tested in Europe and have been used successfully in the US on animals. Beagle breeders have used one in kennels for years to prevent the spread of a highly contagious wart, caused by a virtually identical strain of the virus. </p> <p><strong> Lung cancer: </strong><br> The US firm Introgen has developed a device similar to an asthma inhaler to introduce a lung cancer vaccine into the body.

      "bodyText": "Doctors have talked for decades about developing a vaccine for cancer which would use the body's immune system to turn the tables on tumours; every few months we read about new trials being carried out in this field by scientists who pepper their speech with adjectives such as \"promising\", \"exciting\" and \"revolutionary\". Some have even made the tantalising prediction that cancer may soon be easily treatable by a simple injection. If so, where are these much-trumpeted vaccines? Even given the lengthy trial and approval period required for new treatments, surely some should have arrived on the market by now, especially as the idea has been knocking around since the 18th century, when Dr Tachon, a French physician, discovered the cancer-fighting benefits of \"laudable pus\". During the 1890s, Tachon's work was developed by William B Coley, a New York surgeon, who injected live bacteria into growing soft tissue tumours, some of which shrank after a brisk inflammatory response. Later doctors began to notice that some skin and kidney cancers spontaneously regress, the only explanation being that they are under attack by the patient's immune system. Some melanoma (skin cancer) patients also experience vitiligo, or loss of skin pigmentation, which is an auto-immune response to the skin's own melanin-producing cells. This may all sound encouraging, but the fact is that cancer, which comes in more than 200 forms and will affect one in three of us, is not even close to becoming a thing of the past. Vaccines may grab headlines, but vaccine research accounts for less than \u00a31m of the Cancer Research Campaign's \u00a361m annual research budget, and the traumatically traditional \"cut it, burn it, poison it\" therapies, which have hardly changed in the past 30 years, are still the best on offer. Even if, or when, vaccines do become a standard weapon in the oncologist's armoury, radio and chemotherapy will still be needed to shrink the tumour in the first place to improve chances of success. Dr David Miles, joint head of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund's breast cancer biology group, is leading a vaccine trial involving 900 breast cancer patients. He says: \"The idea of a vaccine is intellectually appealing, but this is an incredibly complex area, and it would be wrong to say we're on the brink of a breakthrough.\" He believes a vaccine is worth pursuing, however, because there is so little chance of further improvement in conventional therapies. Various types of vaccine are being developed, most of which use either tumour cells or antigens (proteins which \"mark\" the surface structure of the cell). The cells, sometimes taken from the patient's own tumour, are irradiated to kill them and then re-injected along with an agent to provoke a response from the immune system - similar to methods used by Coley more than a century ago. These cell vaccines, especially the individually tailored ones, can be complex and expensive to prepare. Antigen vaccines, however, are cheap and easy to mass produce, and are being developed with a view to treating pancreatic cancer, for example, which is nearly always caused by a specific antigen mutation. In Miles's trial, the vaccine, Theratope, attacks cancer cells by recognising a particular sugar which is only exposed in diseased cells. It is too early for the trial to be showing any survival benefits. One of the problems in developing vaccines, says Miles, is that cancer cells - despite their bizarre and uncontrolled behaviour - may still be similar to surrounding tissue, and may \"learn\" how to switch off the signals which should alert the immune system. Also, because there are \"demonstrably effective\" treatments already in use for some common cancers, such as breast cancer, it's difficult to justify testing anything new except in the most advanced cases where all else has failed. This is far from ideal, particularly as repeated chemo- therapy may have damaged the immune system to the extent where it cannot be stimulated by vaccines. \"Only patients with cancers such as melanoma, for whom conventional treatment is rarely effective, are being tested with vaccines in the early stages,\" he says. David Kerr, professor of clinical oncology at Birmingham University, is three months into a vaccine trial involving nine patients suffering from hepatoma, a liver cancer - rampant in the Middle East - which is sparked by hepatitis. \"Cancer vaccines were largely discredited in the 70s and 80s because at that time we didn't understand enough about the science of the immune system,\" he says. \"But now we're in a position to plan them better. It may seem that progress has been slow, but up until now, we've really been working on finding out how to make the vaccines work. \"Surgery is always going to be the mainstay of cancer treatment, but I believe the time for rational vaccines has come. We need massive trials involving thousands of people and five years down the road we will be able to measure the vaccines' success.\" More immediately promising is another type of vaccine - the only true vaccine, in the prophylactic sense. It attacks viruses, which have in recent years been implicated in up to 20% of all cancers and may be responsible for more. These include the human papilloma, or wart, virus, which causes 99% of cervical cancers, the human T-cell leukaemia virus, and the Epstein-Barr virus, which can cause glandular fever and is also associated with lymphoma and naso-pharyngeal cancer. The hepatitis B and C viruses can cause liver cancer - the commonest cancer worldwide. There is already a vaccine for hepatitis B, which in trials seems to protect the woodchuck - a burrowing rodent native to North America, also known as the groundhog - from liver cancer, and which may be responsible for falling cancer rates in Taiwan. There could also be a viral link to some breast cancers, while Kaposi's sarcoma, found in Aids patients, is caused by the cytomegalo virus and a herpes virus. Another much-vaunted trial area is genetic vaccines. These use disabled retroviruses from mice to introduce cancer-fighting genes into the immune system. Work is still at a very early stage, and has raised fears that the viruses could \"infect\" more than one type of cell with the genetic material, potentially causing other cancers, or permanently affecting future generations by ending up in egg or sperm cells. They could even be transmitted to other people or the environment. Miles, however, is \"cautiously optimistic\". \"It's hard enough to make a vaccine against a virus - and that's an obvious foreign agent,\" he says. \"If we can't even vaccinate against the common cold, it gives you some idea of how long it will be before we can routinely vaccinate for cancer.\" The idea has strong appeal for patients, however. \"They feel they can use their own immune systems to fight the disease, enabling them to take control in some way rather than being the recipient of an unpleasant treatment from doctors.\" Dee Merry, 54, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1995 and secondary liver cancer last year, is taking part in Miles's trial. \"Secondary cancer is treatable, but not curable,\" she says. \"So this certainly can't do me any harm. I believe very strongly in positive thinking and if vaccines are ever going to work, someone has to be involved in the trials. It's great to be involved in something that's going to help people in the future too.\" Dee, a former prison officer, says the vaccine injections in her thighs are like \"100 bee stings\" and cause extreme discomfort for a day or two. \"But it's worth it even if the cancer flares up again. At least it might build up my immune system to the point where I can put up the best possible fight.\" Miles says the most important weapon against cancer will continue to be improving understanding of the disease. \"Even though we may not be seeing anything spectacular just yet, there are incremental improvements,\" he says. \"With a disease as common as cancer, those improvements are important, and this is an area in which we cannot justify stopping work.\" Vaccines: the state of play Genetic vaccines: US and French scientists have found a way of enabling the immune system to recognise an abnormal genetic structure called a telomere, which is switched on in 85% of cancer cells and allows them to grow and divide endlessly. A prototype genetic vaccine uses programmed white blood cells to attack cells with this abnormality and kill them before they grow into a tumour. Breast cancer: Herceptin, an engineered antibody, recognises a surface abnormality in up to 30% of breast cancer cells and can induce remission. It is already licensed for use in the US and may soon be available in the UK. Scientists in New Orleans have isolated a virus associated with breast cancer. It is not contagious, but is in the genetic make-up of up to 30% of the population and almost identical to one identified as a cause of breast cancer in mice in 1942. Lead scientist Robert Garry says the virus was found in 85% of 30 breast cancer samples. Cervical cancer: US scientists, with $3million in government funding, are using genetically modified tobacco to make a vaccine to protect against human papilloma virus. Cynics say the government is just trying to appease politically powerful, yet hard-pressed tobacco farmers in an election year. Other HPV vaccines are being tested in Europe and have been used successfully in the US on animals. Beagle breeders have used one in kennels for years to prevent the spread of a highly contagious wart, caused by a virtually identical strain of the virus. Lung cancer: The US firm Introgen has developed a device similar to an asthma inhaler to introduce a lung cancer vaccine into the body. They say using it between cigarettes could repair the damage caused to cells by the toxins in the smoke. It would infect cells with a harmless virus modified to carry a human gene, p53, that normally repairs damaged DNA, or causes cells to die if the damage is too great. The body's regular supply of p53 is often made ineffective in smokers by the chemicals in the smoke. Kidney cancer: Seventeen sufferers were treated with a vaccine at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany. Four achieved total regression, three more partial regression, and two saw their cancer stabilise for over a year.",

The fact is that the mere notion of introducing a gaggle of live maggots into an open wound is enough to have the fainthearted leaping from their sickbeds. </p> <p>A paper released last week from specialists at West Cumberland hospital in Cumbria could make them think again. Twelve patients with serious, \"sloughy\" leg ulcers took part in the study; six of them were treated with conventional hydrogel therapy, six with larval therapy (a more reassuring term for maggots). After one application of maggots, left in the wound for three days, all six of these patients were left with clean wounds. Of the others, only two had clean wounds after a month of treatment, with the other four needing further medical attention. </p> <p>\"It was a small pilot study to prove that the maggots were a valid purchase,\" says Anne Walker, a leg ulcer specialist nurse at the hospital. \"We needed evidence of cost-effectiveness, and there was no research on this. We knew how effective the treatment was - we've been using maggots since 1997 - but we were so amazed with this outcome that we decided we had to publish it.\" </p> <p>The use of maggots in treating serious wounds is well documented, although one commonly held view is that the creatures were best left festering in the trenches. In fact, larval therapy did survive for a while after its successful use in the first world war and American civil war: it was widely used in the 1930s in America, and declined only with the arrival of antibiotics in the 1940s. So why is it back? </p> <p>\"It's gone full circle,\" says Dr Steve Thomas, director of the biosurgical research unit at the surgical materials testing laboratory (SMTL) in Bridgend, Glamorgan, which supplies sterile maggots to hospitals across the UK. \"With the problems of modern antibiotics, there is a tendency to go back to nature.\" And maggots can achieve naturally what manufactured medicines are increasingly failing to do: wipe out the superbugs, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which outsmart more conventional antibiotics. </p> <p>\"A wound can have sloughy or necrotic tissue fixed to it,\" says Walker. \"Maggots excrete an enzyme which softens the dead tissue, and then they ingest all the slough and bacteria, without damaging the good tissue.\" </p> <p>A dressing protects healthy skin from these enzymes and a sterile mesh rules out any risk of escape. And only rarely can a patient feel the creatures going about their business. </p> <p>Despite the evidence of larval therapy's amazing efficiency, squeamishness still plays a part in hindering its widespread adoption. The reticence comes from an unexpected quarter, however. \"We have used maggots in over a hundred cases,\" says Walker, \"and not once have we had a patient decline the treatment. If you explain that they don't have to see it, and that they usually won't feel it, they're quite happy.\" </p> <p>\"Maggots aren't sexy, they're not high-technology, they're not expensive and they don't require expertise,\" says Thomas. \"For some the problem is a physical loathing - it's as simple as that. And it's the medical profession which is the most squeamish.\" </p> <p>It is perhaps understandable, though, that many in the profession are reluctant to make use of techniques that are associated with the more primitive eras of medicine. When a British woman travelled to America last February to have a hole drilled into her head in a desperate attempt to cure her depression, many doctors were horrified at the idea that the ancient technique of trepanning (once thought to release evil spirits from the brain) could still be in practice. However, the use of maggots and other creepy-crawlies - now known as biosurgery - has much stronger arguments in its favour. </p> <p>Leeches were used for medicinal purposes as early as 200BC, but the practice of blood-letting, to cure everything from gout to headaches, lost its appeal in the 19th century. Now, patients who have lost an ear or a finger are likely to wake from surgery to find that their tissue is not the only thing that has been attached. Venous insufficiency, where poor circulation or blood clots threaten the reattached tissue, can be countered by the natural bloodsucking of the leech, which improves natural circulation by gorging itself on the patient's blood. Even after the creature has sated itself and fallen off, the patient will continue to bleed for an average of 10 hours, preventing clots and gangrene. </p> <p>\"The public likes the idea of using things that are natural,\" says Thomas, who believes that we will increasingly see the use of remedies such as honey, which competes with bacteria for moisture, thereby drying out and healing infected wounds. </p> <p> The stumbling block will not be patient reticence or even staff repulsion - Walker says that most nurses are enthusiastic once they have been trained to apply the maggots properly - but rather more mundane problems: cost and bureaucracy. </p> <p>\"We have a trust that recognises that new treatments can be very cost-effective,\" says Walker. \"Some trusts find the maggots too expensive, which means that it's not available to everybody.\" She points out that while the larval therapy can initially be more expensive to purchase, the speed with which the maggots clean up wounds make them highly economical. In the West Cumberland study, the average cost per patient for larval therapy was \u00a378.64. The cost for those on conventional therapy was \u00a3136.23 - and two-thirds of those patients required yet more treatment. </p> <p>Discussions with the drug tariff authorities are under way to try to secure prescription status for larval therapy. Only 20% of wound dressings are carried out in hospitals and fans of the maggot believe that it could be hugely beneficial for community nursing and in doctors' surgeries. </p> <p>Ironically, the SMTL larvae were last November granted Millennium Product status (they don't appear in the Millennium Dome as they have a tendency to turn into flies). Archaic it may be, but maggot therapy is officially a 21st century treatment. Its only problem now is that it has come up against that age-old complaint: red tape.</p>",

In the West Cumberland study, the average cost per patient for larval therapy was \u00a378.64. The cost for those on conventional therapy was \u00a3136.23 - and two-thirds of those patients required yet more treatment. Discussions with the drug tariff authorities are under way to try to secure prescription status for larval therapy. Only 20% of wound dressings are carried out in hospitals and fans of the maggot believe that it could be hugely beneficial for community nursing and in doctors' surgeries. Ironically, the SMTL larvae were last November granted Millennium Product status (they don't appear in the Millennium Dome as they have a tendency to turn into flies). Archaic it may be, but maggot therapy is officially a 21st century treatment. Its only problem now is that it has come up against that age-old complaint: red tape.",

Government guidelines for local authority exclusion appeal panels, outlined today, made it clear that heads should not be expected to take back children expelled for violence, sexual abuse, drug dealing or persistent defiance of school codes such as uniforms. Heads welcomed what has been described as a U-turn by the government but stressed that the new guidelines did not go far enough. Schools minister Jacqui Smith told the Professional Association of Teachers annual conference in Cheltenham that the new rules for appeal panels reinforced the powers of heads to enforce discipline in their schools. \"It is right that parents have some recourse to appeal where their child is excluded but it is equally important that the needs of all other children at the school are met. \"There should be no doubt in anybody's mind about the rights of headteachers to exclude permanently where necessary nor of the government's clear commitment to providing proper funding for appropriate in-school and out-of-school units to help teachers ensure that disruptive pupils are not kept in the classroom.\" The Department for Education and Employment insisted that the government's target of reducing the annual rate of expulsions - currently running at 12,000 a year - by a third by 2002 still stood. A spokesman pointed to figures released in May showing the latest figures were down to 10,500 as evidence they were on track to achieve that goal. But David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"As for the government's targets to reduce the number of expulsions by a third by 2002, well that's just a dead duck - the target was unrealistic to begin with.\" He said he would be approaching the government next week to ask it to make sure that serious bullying, racial and sexual harassment, theft and vandalism of school property would in future be grounds to refuse an appeal against expulsion.

Nor should we have to live lives divorced from our families and friends.</p> <p>MPs' responsibilities are not compatible with current parliamentary arrangements. We must be one of the few institutions in the country where people regularly go to work not knowing when they will return home. Modernisers are not seeking to work fewer hours. By rearranging the times and voting systems, just as many hours would be worked, but MPs would be more alert and more ready to engage. The parliamentary year should be fixed and more use made of pre-scrutiny of legislation. The modernisation committee has proposed taking last votes at 10pm Monday to Wednesday and 7pm on Thursday. I would go further, with no business after those hours and time limits on all questions and speeches so that all MPs wanting to make a genuine contribution could do so. Ending Friday sittings would also provide guaranteed time for constituents on one day a week.</p> <p>A new speaker should become the champion of modernisation, making it clear that he or she wanted to preside over a modern workplace. It is emblematic of the Commons that we are supplied with pink ribbon for our swords in the cloakroom, but no computers or child care facilities. A modernising speaker would want to end the proliferation of committees and support the appointment of a chief executive.</p> <p>The traditions of the House have resulted in MPs becoming small businesses. Arrangements are haphazard, with many staff on poverty wages and many offices ill-equipped to deal with constituents' demands. The government is naturally wary of voting through more money for what the tabloids insist on calling \"MPs' perks\". Yet what modernisers want is for staff salaries to be taken out of their hands, put on civil service scales and administered directly, and for IT to be standardised and paid for centrally.</p> <p>As Betty Boothroyd warned, the public are losing interest in parliament. No wonder. If parliament cannot modernise itself, it will continue to decline.

A court in Beijing yesterday found Cheng Kejie, a former deputy-chairman of China's parliament, guilty of accepting nearly $5m (\u00a33.3m) in kickbacks in collusion with his mistress Li Ping. Ms Li has been portrayed as the seductress who accompanied Mr Cheng down the path to ruin, and will be tried at a later date. A Communist party spokesman has blamed Cheng's downfall on \"the temptations of women and money\". State television has shown pictures of the gold, diamond rings and expensive watches that the couple acquired. They are also said to have been caught on close-circuit television blithely gambling away their loot in casinos in Macau. Many ordinary Chinese see Cheng's case as a familiar example of corruption in high places, and some wonder why it took so long to come to court. Critics say that it illustrates the ease with which senior officials in the provinces have milked China's economic reforms for private gain during the past decade. Cheng climbed the ladder of the Communist party in the relatively remote southern province of Guangxi from 1986 until he became the top party boss. As China's provinces scrambled to show Beijing that they were \"in the vanguard of modernisation\", Cheng's star rose until he was appointed to the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress in 1998. He used his patronage to sell lucrative contracts and management posts to the highest bidder. He took kick-backs from allocating state land for building projects, from granting illegal loans out of government funds and from the sale of public offices. Cheng was originally slated for prosecution in Guangxi, but Beijing's anti-corruption investigators apparently feared that he would bribe his way out of trouble. There are also rumours of a connection between Cheng and China's former premier Li Peng, now chairman of the National People's Congress, which may have caused complications. Public opinion in Guangxi regards Cheng as a crook who fully deserves exemplary punishment. He is said to have collected pay-offs from many lucrative construction projects, including a splendid but un der-used motorway between the provincial capital, Nanning, and the second-most important city, Liuzhou. Chinese TV yesterday showed Cheng being placed in handcuffs to hear the execution verdict passed down by the Beijing intermediate court. He will be the highest Chinese leader to be executed for corruption. Cheng has been given 10 days to appeal, but sentences are almost never overturned. His execution is likely to coincide with an informal meeting of the top Chinese leadership later this month at their traditional summer resort on the north Chinese coast.

They are similar to British party conferences, but focus much more on polling day. <p><b>Do they matter?</b><br> Arguably not. This year, for instance, both presidential candidates were chosen long before the convention season and the selection of their running mates had nothing to do with the meetings. Even the television coverage which once provided a free boost to the campaigns has been cut back. In the summer of 1952 the main American TV networks devoted 200 hours of coverage to the two conventions. This year, they'll give them around 10 hours.</p> <p><b>So why do people still take an interest in them?</b><br> Partly because the conventions mark the start of the run-in to election day in November, and the presidential election does still matter a great deal. Partly, too, because conventions are a good way of testing the mood of each party. Are they confident? Do extremists hold the upper hand? Does the candidate impress? Conventions may not win votes for candidates but they still run the risk of losing them.</p> <p><b>Have they ever mattered?</b><br> Yes. In the past they often determined who would run for president. In 1952, for instance, Dwight Eisenhower arrived at the convention with fewer party votes than his rival Robert Taft, and left as the candidate.

Together.' The party has put on a glitzy, entirely-orchestrated show, culminating with a speech by George Bush junior with the theme 'President with a purpose: A strong leader who can unite our country and get things done'. Around 45,000 delegates, guests, and journalists will watch all this, the delegates gathering state by state. Bush is using this year's convention to stress his party's compassion; on the first day speeches highlighted black and Hispanic involvement in the party. Journalists complain that this focus on moderation makes the whole thing seem bland.</p> <p><b>And the Democrats?</b><br> The Democrats are meeting in Los Angeles from August 14-17 under the slogan America 2000. It's possible that Al Gore will wait until then to declare the name of his running mate, but he, too, will probably pre-empt the convention. As the underdog in the presidential race it will be important for Gore to make an impact; if he does not it will be hard for him to move ahead of Bush. One focus of interest will be Bill Clinton's role. He's keen to make a splash in his last months as president, but Gore may feel that keeping his current boss at a distance will help his electoral chances.</p> <p><b>Useful links </b> <br><a href=\"http://www.gopconvention.com/\" target=\"_new\">The Republican convention</a><br><a href=\"http://www.dems2000.com/index2.html\" target=\"_new\">The Democratic convention</a></p>",

The report went on: \"There is no single element to make the visitor gasp in astonishment - to provide the 'wow' factor that was originally sought.\" They said the fluctuation in the estimates for visitor numbers ranged from 15 million to the current six million but that the changes seemed to have been made \"without proper regard to the immense financial implications those changes entailed\". They added there was \"no clear line of responsibility\" for overseeing the project but that ultimate responsibility for the over-estimation of visitor numbers lay with Dome operators, the New Millennium Experience Company, and the government ministers responsible for the project. The committee's report said there was still a lack of clarity as to how much lottery money received so far was loan and how much grant. MPs said NMEC did not place a sufficient emphasis on marketing before the Dome opened and was unduly reliant on free coverage in the press. \"That approach proved to be disastrous when the press coverage became largely hostile,\" the report said.",

      "body": "<p>It is not surprising that rednecks with rusting Chevys on their lawns and conservative Wall Streeters who guzzle beers after work and cops with gun collections are not wild about Hillary Clinton. But it is surprising that women - her most natural constituents, the dream demographic of her pollsters - are not wild about her either. </p> <p>It makes sense that a certain type of man is, as feminist cant would have it, threatened by Hillary Clinton, that a certain type of man doesn't like her dogged refusal to be feminine, or rather her extravagantly faked efforts to be feminine (note the soft pink sweater and pearls she wore in her video announcing that she was running for senate; the embarrassing effort to discuss cookie recipes). But why do the women of New York state feel threatened, or if not threatened then extremely put off? The lukewarm support Clinton has received from her most likely supporters is a problem the press has been puzzling over since the beginning of the campaign, with the New York Times periodically running articles such as \"Clinton campaign confronts erosion of women's support\". </p> <p>If you designed a candidate on paper to appeal to the women of New York it would be a tough, high profile, liberal woman who could represent the state in Washington and have enough clout to be heard. A female senatorial candidate who could plausibly run for president, with intellectual heft, the sheen of celebrity, with (after all this time and work and hair dye) the ability to appeal to mainstream voters - in other words, Hillary Clinton. And yet there is a hesitation, a cloud that passes over the faces of women across the state when her name comes up. They may vote for her in November in a lesser- of-two-evils sort of way, but they won't really, ardently like her. A poll early this week put Clinton seven percentage points behind her Republican rival, Rick Lazio. </p> <p>In fact, it is women who are most icy and vitriolic in their attacks. Consider this headline for a New York Post column written by a woman: \"Just what is it about a phony like Hillary that makes my skin crawl?\" Another woman writes, also in the New York Post: \"The time is at hand to set aside our petty hatreds and vis ceral fears, and to make an objective, dispassionate examination of the Yankee loving, Suha Arafat kissing, Al Sharpton pandering woman from Chappaqua.\" </p> <p>But where does all this antipathy come from? It is a difficult question because most women have trouble pinning down exactly what it is they don't like about Clinton. One thing women often say is that they don't trust her. Which is particularly strange since her cheating, womanising husband's approval ratings remain fairly high. It seems that she is the recipient of any lingering discomfort we may feel with the arrangement that the Clintons call marriage. Strangely enough, it is she who emerged from the embarrassments of the past year seeming slippery. And it has nothing to do with lying, it has to do with reserve, with standing aloof. </p> <p>The dignity with which Clinton conducted herself during her husband's impeachment seemed at first to be an asset. She was on the cover of Vogue. Her popularity soared. The mere fact of her humiliation, of the circumstances constructed around her by her husband, had elevated a vaguely unpopular first lady to an ideal without her having to say or do anything. But then she took the dignity thing too far. She wouldn't show bruises. She wouldn't express emotion. And when she did it sounded eerily scripted. </p> <p>The rumours swirled through Washington and New York that she had faked being mad at the president, that she wouldn't hold his hand on the way to Martha's Vineyard as part of a deliberate effort to appear angry - to prove that her marriage had some flesh and blood in it. This was probably just a rumour but it fed into and reflected an image of the Clinton marriage as a sham, a cool arrangement of convenience, that many people already believed. Her decision to stand by her man started to seem to many like a shrewd bargain in which she would get the senate seat. </p> <p>And then two weeks ago a widely circulated anecdote from the sensationalist book State of the Union fed into a similar suspicion. It described a letter she allegedly wrote to Clinton before they were married: \"I know all of your little girls are around there. If that is what this is, you will outgrow this. Remember what we've talked about. Remember the goals we've set for ourselves. You keep trying to stray from the plan we've put together.\" </p> <p>This is the chilling, Lady Macbeth-like Clinton that the country always imagined. Her high-school newspaper had predicted that the 16-year-old Hillary Rodham would become a nun called Sister Frigidaire, and it is the Sister Frigidaire side of her character that reveals itself in this gossip. The \"evidence\" of her calculating side is probably lies and certainly a caricature, but the fact that it exists at all indicates a fundamental distrust: she is not just pretending to be a New Yorker and a New York Yankee fan, she is pretending to be a woman. </p> <p>Even if it were all true, this cynical opportunism, this lack of feeling at the centre of her life shouldn't necessarily alienate the sophisticated high-heeled masses of New York city. One might argue that Clinton, carpet- bagger that she is, is only reflecting the values of New York: power, drive and ambition. Perhaps the problem is not that the bitchy, ambitious women of New York do not accept her as their own, but that they do. They accept her so completely that they resent her, they admire her, they secretly want to see her fall. </p> <p>It may be that Clinton taps into a competitive energy that runs through the state like water pipes. That other women who did well in law school and are partners in law firms more prestigious than hers, but who happened to marry TV executives or aspiring sculptors instead of future presidents of the United States, think to themselves: what has she ever done? And somewhere beneath that commonly articulated thought is the nagging whisper, why not me? (Clinton has, in a sort of indirect way, acknowledged the competition problem she seems to have with women in the state: \"I think it's understandable that people say, 'Well, who is she, and why is she doing this, where is she coming from, and what has she ever done on her own?' \") </p> <p>Political strategists are always looking for groups that can \"identify\" with a candidate. Clinton has hired the super pollster and former corporate mastermind, Mark Penn, to research her potential constituents so that she can seem more like them. But in New York it may turn out that having voters identify with you is more complicated and perilous than it might be in other places. </p> <p>The truth is that New York has never been easy on women candidates. You would think with all of the politically minded, moneyed, liberal women in New York that it would be one of the first states to produce a woman governor or senator, a female politician of real charisma and national importance - but we have yet to elect a single one. In fact we have yet to produce a woman candidate that we are strongly behind for any length of time whatsoever. </p> <p> Even relatively high- profile congresswomen such as Elizabeth Holtzman and Geraldine Ferraro have a hard time when they run for higher office, or even when they just try to hold on to their jobs. We turn against them. We start to dislike them. Part of it may be the mediocrity of our candidates, the fact that we haven't had a female version of the current New York senator, Pat Moynihan. But even if we did, it seems to me, we might turn a particularly ferocious scrutiny on her and pick her apart like sophomores in a high-school lunchroom: Just what is it about that phony Hillary Clinton that makes my skin crawl? Could it be that in New York we love the idea of a strong woman, but we don't actually like strong women? </p> <p>How do you diffuse that competitive instinct? Most women who have come as far in life as Clinton know how to do it. A self-deprecating joke. A story of incompetence. A hint of emotional neediness. Of course if she were warmer, or simply cleverer, she could have done the equivalent on a larger political scale. </p> <p>If she gave the American public a hint of the Bridget Jones/Princess Diana sense of weakness and vulnerability (I am also worried about my thighs/husband) then more women might see their way to liking her. But this is precisely what she won't or can't seem to do. She is willing to change almost everything about herself - her hair, her views, her attitude toward baking chocolate-chip cookies, her accent (which suddenly became extremely southern when she famously appeared on Sixty Minutes to explain her husband's first public infidelity) - but she is not willing to change that one crucial thing: she will not show weakness. </p> <p>In a way this makes her a feminist icon, a chilling feminist heroine: a woman who refuses to be vulnerable, who deftly manipulates power, who does not allow love to get in the way of her career goals. In a way she is so perfect a feminist, liberal candidate that she seems almost to have been programmed like an iMac. But then the question is, why are so many of us so uncomfortable with her? If Clinton is the embodiment of certain feminist ideals, then it may be that many of us, even those of us who have benefited by it, don't actually like feminism in its purest form. </p> <p>Clinton seems willing to do anything to become senator and instead of admiring her determination we dislike it. The idea that she is cynically using her marriage to propel herself into ever loftier positions is less palatable to most women than the possibility that she was pathetically loyal to a womaniser. There is something soulless about this kind of politics and this kind of politician, something cold and unsubtle. And although it is appreciated, her upstandingness, her correctness, her belief in the right issues, her determination, her willingness to vote in the right ways doesn't inspire passion. The ideal embodied feels glassy, brittle. </p> <p>When Bill Clinton was first running for president people talked a lot about how great it would be to have a \"strong woman\" in the White House. People liked Hillary Clinton simply because of her image - brainy, powerful, outspoken. Everywhere, there were badges that read: \"Hillary for President\". Now those badges seem like antiques. Relics of a more rigid, hopeful era. </p> <p>\u0095Katie Roiphe is the author of The Morning After: Sex, Fear and Feminism</p>",

And I am proud to join you this evening in commending to all Americans the man who now represents your best wishes and mine for the future of our country, my friend, Governor George W Bush, the next president of the United States.</p> <p>Tomorrow, we will formally nominate Governor Bush. We do so not for our sake alone. We do not seek his election merely to acquire an advantage over our political opponents or offices for our party faithful. We have a grander purpose than that.</p> <p>When we nominate Governor Bush for president, here in the city where our great nation was born, we invest him with the faith of our founding fathers, and charge him with the care of the cause they called glorious.</p> <p>We are blessed to be Americans, not just in times of prosperity, but at all times. We are part of something providential; a great experiment to prove to the world that democracy is not only the most effective form of government, but the only moral government.</p> <p>And through the years, generation after generation of Americans has held fast to the belief that we were meant to transform history.</p> <p>On an early December morning, many years ago, I watched my father leave for war. He joined millions of Americans to fight a world war that would decide the fate of humanity. They fought against a cruel and formidable enemy bent on world domination. They fought not just for themselves and their families, not just to preserve the quality of their own lives. They fought for love, for love of an idea - that America stood for something greater than the sum of our individual interests.</p> <p>From where did the courage come to make the maximum effort in that decisive moment in history? It marched with the sons of a nation that believed deeply in itself, in its history, in the justice of its cause, in its magnificent destiny. Americans went into battle armed against despair with the common conviction that the country that had sent them there was worth their sacrifice.</p> <p>Their families, their schools, their faith, their history, their heroes taught them that the freedom with which they were blessed deserved patriots to defend it. Many would never come home. But those who did returned with an even deeper civic love. They believed that if America were worth dying for, then surely she was worth living for. They were, as Tocqueville said of Americans, \"haunted by visions of what will be\".</p> <p>They built an even greater nation than the one they had left their homes to defend; an America that offered more opportunities to more of its people than ever before; an America that began to redress injustices that had been visited on too many of her citizens for too long. They bound up the wounds of war for ally and enemy alike. And when faced with a new, terrible threat to the security and freedom of the world, they fought that too. As did their sons and daughters. And they prevailed.</p> <p>Now we stand unsurpassed in our wealth and power. What shall we make of it? Let us take courage from their example, and from the new world they built, build a better one. This new century will be an age of untold possibilities for us and for all mankind.</p> <p>Many nations now share our love of liberty and aspire to the ordered progress of democracy. But the world is still home to tyrants, haters and aggressors hostile to America and our ideals. We are obliged to seize this moment to help build a safer, freer and more prosperous world, completely free of the tyranny that made the last century such a violent age.</p> <p>We are strong, confident people. We know that our ideals, our courage, our ingenuity ensure our success. Isolationism and protectionism are fool's errands. We shouldn't build walls to the global success of our interests and values. Walls are for cowards, my friends, not for Americans.</p> <p>No nation complacent in its greatness will long sustain it. We are an unfinished nation. And we are not a people of half-measures. We who have found shelter beneath the great oak must care for it in our time with as much devotion as had the patriots who preceded us.</p> <p>This is an extraordinary time to be alive. We are so strong and prosperous that we can scarcely imagine the heights we could ascend if we have the will to make the climb. Yet I think each of us senses that America, for all our prosperity, is in danger of losing the best sense of herself: that there is a purpose to being an American beyond materialism.</p> <p>Cynicism is suffocating the idealism of many Americans, especially among our young. And with cause, for they have lost pride in their government. Too often those who hold a public trust have failed to set the necessary example. Too often, partisanship seems all consuming. Differences are defined with derision.</p> <p>Too often, we seem to put our personal interests before the national interest, leaving the people's business unattended while we posture, poll and spin. When the people believe that government no longer embodies our founding ideals, then basic civil consensus will deteriorate as people seek substitutes for the unifying values of patriotism.</p> <p>National pride will not endure the people's contempt for government. And national pride is as indispensable to the happiness of Americans as is our self-respect.</p> <p>When we quit seeing ourselves as part of something greater than our self-interest then civic love gives way to the temptations of selfishness, bigotry and hate. Unless we restore the people's sovereignty over government, renew their pride in public service, reform our public institutions to meet the challenges of a new day and reinvigorate our national purpose then America's best days will be behind us.</p> <p>To achieve the necessary changes to the practices and institutions of our democracy we need to be a little less content. We need to get riled up a bit, and stand up for the values that made America great. Rally to this new patriotic challenge or lose forever America's extraordinary ability to see around the corner of history.</p> <p>Americans, enter the public life of your country determined to tell the truth; to put problem solving ahead of partisanship; to defend the national interest against the forces that would divide us. Keep your promise to America, as she has kept her promise to you, and you will know a happiness far more sublime than pleasure.</p> <p>It is easy to forget in politics where principle ends and selfishness begins. It takes leaders of courage and character to remember the difference.</p> <p>Tomorrow, our party will nominate such a leader. George W Bush believes in the greatness of America and the justice of our cause. He believes in the America of the immigrant's dream, the high lantern of freedom and hope to the world. He is proud of America's stature as the world's only superpower, and he accepts the responsibilities along with the blessings that come with that hard-earned distinction.</p> <p>He knows well that there is no safe alternative to American leadership. And he will not squander this unique moment in history by allowing America to retreat behind empty threats, false promises, and uncertain diplomacy. He will confidently defend our interests and values wherever they are threatened.</p> <p>I say to all Americans, Republican, Democrat or independent: if you believe America deserves leaders with a purpose more ennobling than expediency and opportunism, then vote for Governor Bush. If you believe patriotism is more than a soundbite and public service should be more than a photo-op then vote for Governor Bush.</p> <p>My friend, Governor Bush, believes in an America that is so much more than the sum of its divided parts. He wants to give you back a government that serves all the people, no matter the circumstances of their birth.</p> <p>And he wants to lead a Republican party that is as big as the country we serve. He wants nothing to divide us into separate nations. Not our colour. Not our race. Not our wealth. Not our religion. Not our politics. He wants us to live for America, as one nation, and together profess the American creed of self-evident truths.</p> <p>I support him. I am grateful to him. And I am proud of him.

      "bodyText": "I am grateful for your kindness to a distant runner-up. And I am proud to join you this evening in commending to all Americans the man who now represents your best wishes and mine for the future of our country, my friend, Governor George W Bush, the next president of the United States. Tomorrow, we will formally nominate Governor Bush. We do so not for our sake alone. We do not seek his election merely to acquire an advantage over our political opponents or offices for our party faithful. We have a grander purpose than that. When we nominate Governor Bush for president, here in the city where our great nation was born, we invest him with the faith of our founding fathers, and charge him with the care of the cause they called glorious. We are blessed to be Americans, not just in times of prosperity, but at all times. We are part of something providential; a great experiment to prove to the world that democracy is not only the most effective form of government, but the only moral government. And through the years, generation after generation of Americans has held fast to the belief that we were meant to transform history. On an early December morning, many years ago, I watched my father leave for war. He joined millions of Americans to fight a world war that would decide the fate of humanity. They fought against a cruel and formidable enemy bent on world domination. They fought not just for themselves and their families, not just to preserve the quality of their own lives. They fought for love, for love of an idea - that America stood for something greater than the sum of our individual interests. From where did the courage come to make the maximum effort in that decisive moment in history? It marched with the sons of a nation that believed deeply in itself, in its history, in the justice of its cause, in its magnificent destiny. Americans went into battle armed against despair with the common conviction that the country that had sent them there was worth their sacrifice. Their families, their schools, their faith, their history, their heroes taught them that the freedom with which they were blessed deserved patriots to defend it. Many would never come home. But those who did returned with an even deeper civic love. They believed that if America were worth dying for, then surely she was worth living for. They were, as Tocqueville said of Americans, \"haunted by visions of what will be\". They built an even greater nation than the one they had left their homes to defend; an America that offered more opportunities to more of its people than ever before; an America that began to redress injustices that had been visited on too many of her citizens for too long. They bound up the wounds of war for ally and enemy alike. And when faced with a new, terrible threat to the security and freedom of the world, they fought that too. As did their sons and daughters. And they prevailed. Now we stand unsurpassed in our wealth and power. What shall we make of it? Let us take courage from their example, and from the new world they built, build a better one. This new century will be an age of untold possibilities for us and for all mankind. Many nations now share our love of liberty and aspire to the ordered progress of democracy. But the world is still home to tyrants, haters and aggressors hostile to America and our ideals. We are obliged to seize this moment to help build a safer, freer and more prosperous world, completely free of the tyranny that made the last century such a violent age. We are strong, confident people. We know that our ideals, our courage, our ingenuity ensure our success. Isolationism and protectionism are fool's errands. We shouldn't build walls to the global success of our interests and values. Walls are for cowards, my friends, not for Americans. No nation complacent in its greatness will long sustain it. We are an unfinished nation. And we are not a people of half-measures. We who have found shelter beneath the great oak must care for it in our time with as much devotion as had the patriots who preceded us. This is an extraordinary time to be alive. We are so strong and prosperous that we can scarcely imagine the heights we could ascend if we have the will to make the climb. Yet I think each of us senses that America, for all our prosperity, is in danger of losing the best sense of herself: that there is a purpose to being an American beyond materialism. Cynicism is suffocating the idealism of many Americans, especially among our young. And with cause, for they have lost pride in their government. Too often those who hold a public trust have failed to set the necessary example. Too often, partisanship seems all consuming. Differences are defined with derision. Too often, we seem to put our personal interests before the national interest, leaving the people's business unattended while we posture, poll and spin. When the people believe that government no longer embodies our founding ideals, then basic civil consensus will deteriorate as people seek substitutes for the unifying values of patriotism. National pride will not endure the people's contempt for government. And national pride is as indispensable to the happiness of Americans as is our self-respect. When we quit seeing ourselves as part of something greater than our self-interest then civic love gives way to the temptations of selfishness, bigotry and hate. Unless we restore the people's sovereignty over government, renew their pride in public service, reform our public institutions to meet the challenges of a new day and reinvigorate our national purpose then America's best days will be behind us. To achieve the necessary changes to the practices and institutions of our democracy we need to be a little less content. We need to get riled up a bit, and stand up for the values that made America great. Rally to this new patriotic challenge or lose forever America's extraordinary ability to see around the corner of history. Americans, enter the public life of your country determined to tell the truth; to put problem solving ahead of partisanship; to defend the national interest against the forces that would divide us. Keep your promise to America, as she has kept her promise to you, and you will know a happiness far more sublime than pleasure. It is easy to forget in politics where principle ends and selfishness begins. It takes leaders of courage and character to remember the difference. Tomorrow, our party will nominate such a leader. George W Bush believes in the greatness of America and the justice of our cause. He believes in the America of the immigrant's dream, the high lantern of freedom and hope to the world. He is proud of America's stature as the world's only superpower, and he accepts the responsibilities along with the blessings that come with that hard-earned distinction. He knows well that there is no safe alternative to American leadership. And he will not squander this unique moment in history by allowing America to retreat behind empty threats, false promises, and uncertain diplomacy. He will confidently defend our interests and values wherever they are threatened. I say to all Americans, Republican, Democrat or independent: if you believe America deserves leaders with a purpose more ennobling than expediency and opportunism, then vote for Governor Bush. If you believe patriotism is more than a soundbite and public service should be more than a photo-op then vote for Governor Bush. My friend, Governor Bush, believes in an America that is so much more than the sum of its divided parts. He wants to give you back a government that serves all the people, no matter the circumstances of their birth. And he wants to lead a Republican party that is as big as the country we serve. He wants nothing to divide us into separate nations. Not our colour. Not our race. Not our wealth. Not our religion. Not our politics. He wants us to live for America, as one nation, and together profess the American creed of self-evident truths. I support him. I am grateful to him. And I am proud of him. He is a good man from a good family that has, in good times and bad, dedicated themselves to America. Many years ago, the governor's father served in the Pacific, with distinction, under the command of my grandfather. Now it is my turn to serve under the son of my grandfather's brave subordinate. I am proud to do so, for I know that by supporting George W Bush I serve my country well. My grandfather was an aviator; my father a submariner. They gave their lives to their country.

Treason carries the death penalty, which has not been enforced since independence in 1970.</p> <p>\"Speight has been charged with minor charges only but we are of course investigating the major crime of treason,\" police officials said.</p> <p>Fiji's military says Mr Speight could face treason charges for storming parliament on May 19 and taking Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji's first ethnic Indian leader, and most of his cabinet hostage in the name of indigenous Fijian rights.</p> <p>Mr Speight and his group were charged last night with unlawful assembly, a minor crime that carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison. The failed businessman was also charged with assisting in the illegal burial of a body in parliament. Mr Speight was among mourners when a rebel killed in a gun battle was buried on July 18. He is also accused of consorting with people who were illegally armed.</p> <p>Mr Speight's lawyer, Kitione Vuetaki, has alleged that Mr Speight and three key aides had been injured while held under military guard. Fiji media said that one ally, Ratu Timoci Silatolu, who was arrested on Friday, might be suffering internal injuries.</p> <p>Mr Speight was arrested last week, and on Saturday moved to Nukulau, a small island which has been declared a no-go zone by the military. Fiji's military had offered him and his core group amnesty from prosecution on charges linked to the storming of parliament as part of a deal to secure the hostages' release.</p> <p>The amnesty was offered on condition the rebels returned all their stolen weapons. It was never granted, because not all guns were returned before the amnesty offer expired last week.

      "bodyText": "George Speight has been charged in connection with the coup two months ago that threatens to unravel Fiji's delicate political fabric, police confirmed today. Authorities were holding back from the most serious charge of treason, although an investigation is still under way. Treason carries the death penalty, which has not been enforced since independence in 1970. \"Speight has been charged with minor charges only but we are of course investigating the major crime of treason,\" police officials said. Fiji's military says Mr Speight could face treason charges for storming parliament on May 19 and taking Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji's first ethnic Indian leader, and most of his cabinet hostage in the name of indigenous Fijian rights. Mr Speight and his group were charged last night with unlawful assembly, a minor crime that carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison. The failed businessman was also charged with assisting in the illegal burial of a body in parliament. Mr Speight was among mourners when a rebel killed in a gun battle was buried on July 18. He is also accused of consorting with people who were illegally armed. Mr Speight's lawyer, Kitione Vuetaki, has alleged that Mr Speight and three key aides had been injured while held under military guard. Fiji media said that one ally, Ratu Timoci Silatolu, who was arrested on Friday, might be suffering internal injuries. Mr Speight was arrested last week, and on Saturday moved to Nukulau, a small island which has been declared a no-go zone by the military. Fiji's military had offered him and his core group amnesty from prosecution on charges linked to the storming of parliament as part of a deal to secure the hostages' release. The amnesty was offered on condition the rebels returned all their stolen weapons. It was never granted, because not all guns were returned before the amnesty offer expired last week. Mr Speight is also alleged to have made threats to Fiji's ailing head of state, 79-year-old President Ratu Josefa Iloilo. Another seven of Mr Speight's inner circle were arrested today, one day after scores of rebel supporters were hauled into court as prosecutors pressed the first charges stemming from the coup. The suspects bore injuries which their supporters claimed were incurred during arrest. Almost all, who were charged with unlawful assembly, pleaded innocent and released on bail. The interim prime minister, Laisenia Qarase, yesterday toured parliament to witness the damage caused during the eight-week hostage stand-off. \"We have seen the extent of the desecration and destruction of the facilities of the finest institution in the country,\" Mr Qarase said. \"It is a national disgrace. It is difficult to believe that so few people can inflict so much damage and bring so much pain to the rest of the country.\" The new government is strongly pro-indigenous Fijian, though it includes no close Speight supporters. Mr Qarase has promised to pursue a nationalist agenda, appointing a commission to rewrite the constitution to strengthen indigenous Fijians' hold on power before elections are held, possibly in three years. Meanwhile police were trying to quell violence in areas loyal to Mr Speight.

      "body": "<p>India's most notorious bandit was preparing last night to negotiate with officials after kidnapping one of the country's most venerable film stars.</p> <p>The kidnap of Rajkumar (pictured) is the climax to a criminal career in which Veerappan, who is wanted for more than 150 murders, has eluded capture for almost 15 years by hiding in southern India's impenetrable jungles.</p> <p>Veerappan and at least 10 armed accomplices burst in on Rajkumar, a 72-year-old screen actor and veteran of 210 films, on Sunday night.</p> <p>His farmhouse in the southern state of Tamil Nadu is near thick and mountainous jungle where Veerappan is known to be active.</p> <p>The kidnappers led him and three male relatives into the forest.</p> <p>News of the abduction prompted a swift and furious response in Rajkumar's native state, Karnataka, where he has superstar status. In the capital, Bangalore, protesters pelted newspaper offices with stones, set auto-rickshaws on fire and halted traffic. Schools were closed and bus services stopped.</p> <p>Some 8,000 police officers tried to calm the situation.</p> <p>Karnataka's chief minister, SM Krishna, flew to Tamil Nadu for urgent talks with his counterpart, M Karunanidhi. They agreed to send an emissary in \"a day or two\" to negotiate with Veerappan. The emissary, a Tamil magazine editor who has met Veerappan in the past, would discuss \"some of the problems\" he is facing, Mr Krishna said.</p> <p>At the isolated farmhouse in the village of Gajanur, 140 miles south of Bangalore, Rajkumar's relatives said they were stunned by his abduction. \"The whole village is waiting. No one has eaten. We are waiting for him to be released,\" Prema Gopal said.</p> <p>Veerappan is wanted by the police in connection with 50 kidnappings, as well as the murders. A poacher who shot his first elephant almost 40 years ago at the age of 14, he has built up a vast ivory and sandalwood smuggling empire. The police believe he has killed 2,000 elephants.</p> <p>He was last arrested in 1986 but escaped, killing four policeman and a forest official as they slept. Since then he has hidden in the impenetrable forest on the Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border. Rajkumar's kidnap comes after several months in which Veerappan - who sports a handlebar moustache - has kept a relatively low profile. In the early 90s a taskforce of about 15,000 police officers tried unsuccessfully to flush him out. He offered to surrender but the deal fell through and he went on to kidnap nine forest officials. He was last spotted in February, by some shepherds.</p> <p>At a press conference yesterday, Mr Krishna described the kidnapping. \"About 10 or 12 armed people barged into his farmhouse after Dr Rajkumar had his dinner along with his family and was watching television,\" he said.</p> <p>The actor made no attempt to resist and agreed to go with Veerappan, along with the three relatives.</p> <p>Veerappan promised Rajkumar's wife, Parvathamma, that he would not be hurt and gave her an audio cassette outlining his demand for an emissary.

      "bodyText": "India's most notorious bandit was preparing last night to negotiate with officials after kidnapping one of the country's most venerable film stars. The kidnap of Rajkumar (pictured) is the climax to a criminal career in which Veerappan, who is wanted for more than 150 murders, has eluded capture for almost 15 years by hiding in southern India's impenetrable jungles. Veerappan and at least 10 armed accomplices burst in on Rajkumar, a 72-year-old screen actor and veteran of 210 films, on Sunday night. His farmhouse in the southern state of Tamil Nadu is near thick and mountainous jungle where Veerappan is known to be active. The kidnappers led him and three male relatives into the forest. News of the abduction prompted a swift and furious response in Rajkumar's native state, Karnataka, where he has superstar status. In the capital, Bangalore, protesters pelted newspaper offices with stones, set auto-rickshaws on fire and halted traffic. Schools were closed and bus services stopped. Some 8,000 police officers tried to calm the situation. Karnataka's chief minister, SM Krishna, flew to Tamil Nadu for urgent talks with his counterpart, M Karunanidhi. They agreed to send an emissary in \"a day or two\" to negotiate with Veerappan. The emissary, a Tamil magazine editor who has met Veerappan in the past, would discuss \"some of the problems\" he is facing, Mr Krishna said. At the isolated farmhouse in the village of Gajanur, 140 miles south of Bangalore, Rajkumar's relatives said they were stunned by his abduction. \"The whole village is waiting. No one has eaten. We are waiting for him to be released,\" Prema Gopal said. Veerappan is wanted by the police in connection with 50 kidnappings, as well as the murders. A poacher who shot his first elephant almost 40 years ago at the age of 14, he has built up a vast ivory and sandalwood smuggling empire. The police believe he has killed 2,000 elephants. He was last arrested in 1986 but escaped, killing four policeman and a forest official as they slept. Since then he has hidden in the impenetrable forest on the Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border. Rajkumar's kidnap comes after several months in which Veerappan - who sports a handlebar moustache - has kept a relatively low profile. In the early 90s a taskforce of about 15,000 police officers tried unsuccessfully to flush him out. He offered to surrender but the deal fell through and he went on to kidnap nine forest officials. He was last spotted in February, by some shepherds. At a press conference yesterday, Mr Krishna described the kidnapping. \"About 10 or 12 armed people barged into his farmhouse after Dr Rajkumar had his dinner along with his family and was watching television,\" he said. The actor made no attempt to resist and agreed to go with Veerappan, along with the three relatives. Veerappan promised Rajkumar's wife, Parvathamma, that he would not be hurt and gave her an audio cassette outlining his demand for an emissary. Mrs Rajkumar delivered the cassette to Karnataka's chief minister early yesterday It is thought that Veerappan, who has been charged with smuggling ivory worth \u00a31.7m and sandalwood worth \u00a315m, will ask for an amnesty. Rajkumar made his debut in 1954 with the film Bedera Kannappa . His parts have ranged from stricken lover to tough policeman. Three years ago he won India's top cinema honour, the Dada Saheb Phalke award. Last night Rajkumar's son, Shivraj Kumar, pleaded with the protesters in Bangalore and other Karnataka cities to stay calm. \"We realise people want to get my father back. But I would urge people not to make any problems for the police,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Tottenham hope to placate fans angry at the sale of David Ginola by clinching the signing of Barcelona winger Boudewijn Zenden. The 23-year-old Dutch international, who nearly moved to Lazio last week before negotiations broke down, would cost George Graham upwards of \u00a38.5m. But while the Mirror reckon the deal is on, the Star suggests Spurs are wasting their time; Zenden is still hoping his move to Rome can be resurrected, it claims. Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea will battle for the \u00a35m signature of Barcelona central defender Winston Bogarde, who has expressed a desire to ply his trade in the Premiership. Chris Hutchings will spend the last \u00a33m of his transfer kitty to bring Aston Villa's Julian Joachim to Bradford, says the Express. But Teamtalk reckons the diminutive striker will go to Coventry instead, where he will fill the void created by Robbie Keane. Aston Villa manager John Gregory will attempt to sign Valencia defender Joachim Bjorklund should Ugo Ehiogu join Manchester City as expected. The ex-Rangers man, who cannot hold down a regular place with the Champions League finalists, would cost \u00a33m. Middlesbrough boss Bryan Robson is confident of signing Lazio's 30-year-old Croatian striker Alen Boksic by tomorrow, according to the Sun. Martin O'Neill wants Leicester defender Gerry Taggart to follow him to Celtic. The 29-year-old defender is rated at \u00a33m by Peter Taylor. Arsenal will no longer pursue Edu, reports the Sun. The \u00a36m transfer, which hit problems after the Brazilian midfielder's passport was found to be a fake, would take a further six months of untangling red tape to complete; Arsene Wenger will instead concentrate his efforts on bringing \u00a310m Sylvain Wiltord to Highbury. Watford are expected to break their \u00a31.5m transfer record today when they sign midfielder Allan Nielsen and goalkeeper Espen Baardsen from Tottenham. Portsmouth have targeted Nottingham Forest's Nigel Quashie - the midfielder will cost Tony Pulis either \u00a3800,000 or \u00a31.5m, depending whether you trust the Sun or the Daily Mail. If you can bring yourself to trust either, of course. Blackburn defender Darren Peacock is also expected to join the club on a free transfer.

      "body": "<p>I am grateful for your kindness to a distant runner-up. And I am proud to join you this evening in commending to all Americans the man who now represents your best wishes and mine for the future of our country, my friend, Governor George W. Bush, the next President of the United States. Tomorrow, we will formally nominate Governor Bush. We do so not for our sake alone. We do not seek his election merely to acquire an advantage over our political opponents or offices for our party faithful. We have a grander purpose than that. <br><br> When we nominate Governor Bush for President, here in the city where our great nation was born, we invest him with the faith of our founding fathers, and charge him with the care of the cause they called glorious. We are blessed to be Americans, not just in times of prosperity, but at all times. We are part of something providential; a great experiment to prove to the world that democracy is not only the most effective form of government, but the only moral government. And through the years, generation after generation of Americans has held fast to the belief that we were meant to transform history. <br><br> On an early December morning, many years ago, I watched my father leave for war. He joined millions of Americans to fight a world war that would decide the fate of humanity. They fought against a cruel and formidable enemy bent on world domination. They fought not just for themselves and their families, not just to preserve the quality of their own lives. They fought for love, for love of an idea - that America stood for something greater than the sum of our individual interests.<br><br> From where did the courage come to make the maximum effort in that decisive moment in history? It marched with the sons of a nation that believed deeply in itself, in its history, in the justice of its cause, in its magnificent destiny. Americans went into battle armed against despair with the common conviction that the country that had sent them there was worth their sacrifice. <br><br> Their families, their schools, their faith, their history, their heroes taught them that the freedom with which they were blessed deserved patriots to defend it.<br><br> Many would never come home. But those who did returned with an even deeper civic love. They believed that if America were worth dying for, then surely she was worth living for. They were, as Tocqueville said of Americans, \"haunted by visions of what will be.\"<br><br> They built an even greater nation than the one they had left their homes to defend; an America that offered more opportunities to more of its people than ever before; an America that began to redress injustices that had been visited on too many of her citizens for too long. They bound up the wounds of war for ally and enemy alike. And when faced with a new, terrible threat to the security and freedom of the world, they fought that too. As did their sons and daughters. And they prevailed.<br><br> Now we stand unsurpassed in our wealth and power. What shall we make of it? Let us take courage from their example, and from the new world they built, build a better one.<br><br> This new century will be an age of untold possibilities for us and for all mankind. Many nations now share our love of liberty and aspire to the ordered progress of democracy. But the world is still home to tyrants, haters and aggressors hostile to America and our ideals. We are obliged to seize this moment to help build a safer, freer and more prosperous world, completely free of the tyranny that made the last century such a violent age.<br><br> We are strong, confident people. We know that our ideals, our courage, our ingenuity ensure our success. Isolationism and protectionism are fool's errands. We shouldn't build walls to the global success of our interests and values. Walls are for cowards, my friends, not for Americans. No nation complacent in its greatness will long sustain it. We are an unfinished nation. And we are not a people of half-measures. We who have found shelter beneath the great oak must care for it in our time with as much devotion as had the patriots who preceded us. <br><br> This is an extraordinary time to be alive. We are so strong and prosperous that we can scarcely imagine the heights we could ascend if we have the will to make the climb. Yet I think each of us senses that America, for all our prosperity, is in danger of losing the best sense of herself: that there is a purpose to being an American beyond materialism.<br><br> Cynicism is suffocating the idealism of many Americans, especially among our young. And with cause, for they have lost pride in their government. Too often those who hold a public trust have failed to set the necessary example. Too often, partisanship seems all consuming. Differences are defined with derision. Too often, we seem to put our personal interests before the national interest, leaving the people's business unattended while we posture, poll and spin. When the people believe that government no longer embodies our founding ideals, then basic civil consensus will deteriorate as people seek substitutes for the unifying values of patriotism. National pride will not endure the people's contempt for government. And national pride is as indispensable to the happiness of Americans as is our self-respect.<br><br> When we quit seeing ourselves as part of something greater than our self-interest then civic love gives way to the temptations of selfishness, bigotry and hate. Unless we restore the people's sovereignty over government, renew their pride in public service, reform our public institutions to meet the challenges of a new day and reinvigorate our national purpose then America's best days will be behind us.<br><br> To achieve the necessary changes to the practices and institutions of our democracy we need to be a little less content. We need to get riled up a bit, and stand up for the values that made America great. Rally to this new patriotic challenge or lose forever America's extraordinary ability to see around the corner of history. Americans, enter the public life of your country determined to tell the truth; to put problem solving ahead of partisanship; to defend the national interest against the forces that would divide us. Keep your promise to America, as she has kept her promise to you, and you will know a happiness far more sublime than pleasure.<br><br> It is easy to forget in politics where principle ends and selfishness begins. It takes leaders of courage and character to remember the difference. <br><br> Tomorrow, our party will nominate such a leader. George W. Bush believes in the greatness of America and the justice of our cause. He believes in the America of the immigrant's dream, the high lantern of freedom and hope to the world. He is proud of America's stature as the world's only superpower, and he accepts the responsibilities along with the blessings that come with that hard-earned distinction. He knows well that there is no safe alternative to American leadership. And he will not squander this unique moment in history by allowing America to retreat behind empty threats, false promises, and uncertain diplomacy. He will confidently defend our interests and values wherever they are threatened.<br><br> I say to all Americans, Republican, Democrat or Independent, if you believe America deserves leaders with a purpose more ennobling than expediency and opportunism, then vote for Governor Bush. If you believe patriotism is more than a soundbite and public service should be more than a photo-op then vote for Governor Bush.<br><br> My friend, Governor Bush, believes in an America that is so much more than the sum of its divided parts. He wants to give you back a government that serves all the people no matter the circumstances of their birth. And he wants to lead a Republican Party that is as big as the country we serve. He wants nothing to divide us into separate nations. Not our color. Not our race. Not our wealth. Not our religion. Not our politics. He wants us to live for America, as one nation, and together profess the American Creed of self-evident truths.<br><br> I support him. I am grateful to him. And I am proud of him. He is a good man from a good family that has, in good times and bad, dedicated themselves to America. Many years ago, the Governor's father served in the Pacific, with distinction, under the command of my grandfather. Now it is my turn to serve under the son of my grandfather's brave subordinate.<br><br> I am proud to do so for I know that by supporting George W. Bush I serve my country well.<br><br> My grandfather was an aviator; my father a submariner. They gave their lives to their country. In Tokyo Harbor, on the day the Japanese surrendered, they were re-united for the last time. My grandfather would die a few days later. His last words to my father were \"it's an honor to die for your country and your principles.\" I have been an imperfect servant of my country for over forty years, and my many mistakes rightly humble me. But I am their son . . . and they taught me to love my country, and that has made all the difference, my friends, all the difference in the world. <br><br> I am so grateful to have seen America rise to such prominence. But America's greatness is a quest without end, the object beyond the horizon. And it is an inescapable and bittersweet irony of life, that the older we are the more distant the horizon becomes. I will not see what is over America's horizon. The years that remain are not too few I trust, but the immortality that was the aspiration of my youth, has, like all the treasures of youth, quietly slipped away. <br><br> But I have faith. I have faith in you. I have faith in your patriotism, in your passion to build upon the accomplishments of our storied past. I have faith that people who are free to act in their own interests will perceive their interests in an enlightened way and live as one nation, in a kinship of ideals, served by a government that kindles the pride of every one of you. <br><br> I have faith that just beyond the distant horizon live a people who gratefully accept the obligation of their freedom to make of their power and wealth a civilization for the ages - a civilization in which all people share in the promise of freedom.<br><br> I have such faith in you, my fellow Americans.<br><br> And I am haunted by the vision of what will be.</p>",

He is a good man from a good family that has, in good times and bad, dedicated themselves to America. Many years ago, the Governor's father served in the Pacific, with distinction, under the command of my grandfather. Now it is my turn to serve under the son of my grandfather's brave subordinate. I am proud to do so for I know that by supporting George W. Bush I serve my country well. My grandfather was an aviator; my father a submariner. They gave their lives to their country. In Tokyo Harbor, on the day the Japanese surrendered, they were re-united for the last time. My grandfather would die a few days later. His last words to my father were \"it's an honor to die for your country and your principles.\" I have been an imperfect servant of my country for over forty years, and my many mistakes rightly humble me. But I am their son . . . and they taught me to love my country, and that has made all the difference, my friends, all the difference in the world. I am so grateful to have seen America rise to such prominence. But America's greatness is a quest without end, the object beyond the horizon. And it is an inescapable and bittersweet irony of life, that the older we are the more distant the horizon becomes. I will not see what is over America's horizon. The years that remain are not too few I trust, but the immortality that was the aspiration of my youth, has, like all the treasures of youth, quietly slipped away. But I have faith. I have faith in you. I have faith in your patriotism, in your passion to build upon the accomplishments of our storied past. I have faith that people who are free to act in their own interests will perceive their interests in an enlightened way and live as one nation, in a kinship of ideals, served by a government that kindles the pride of every one of you. I have faith that just beyond the distant horizon live a people who gratefully accept the obligation of their freedom to make of their power and wealth a civilization for the ages - a civilization in which all people share in the promise of freedom. I have such faith in you, my fellow Americans. And I am haunted by the vision of what will be.",

      "bodyText": "It was business as usual in Britain's petrol stations today, as the planned protest against high petrol prices got off to a subdued start. Motorists across the country were urged to \"dump the pump\" in the first of what organisers hope will become weekly demonstrations against high levels of tax charged on fuel in the UK. While some motorists simply filled up their tanks yesterday, many continued to take advantage of a petrol price war that has seen some supermarkets lower the price of petrol by around 5p to below 80p a litre. Business was brisk at the Esso service station in West Street, Tradeston, Glasgow, as motorists queued to buy fuel. Stephen McMahon, a self-employed home improvements tradesman from Glasgow, said he sympathised with the campaign but had to fill his van so he could get to work. He said: \"The tax is much too high. I knew about the dump the pump thing but there's no real alternative. I mean, you can't just fill up with water can you?\" A planned slowdown of traffic on the M20 attracted only a dozen cars and lorries. Hundreds of hauliers had been expected to form a \"rolling roadblock\" between Ashford and Dover, according to the Hauliers and Farmers Association, which organised the blockade. But the coordinator of the Boycott the Pumps campaign, Garry Russell, 39, from Chingford, Essex, warned: \"If we sit back and do nothing, then before too long we will have the \u00a35 gallon. \"If we paid as much tax on certain items as we do on petrol then a first-class stamp would cost \u00a31.13, a cinema ticket would be nearly \u00a322 and a loaf of bread would be \u00a31.58. \"I want to see forecourts become no-go areas on Mondays. This is very much an election issue now, with people blaming the government for the high prices.\" He called on drivers not to fill up at petrol stations and to boycott forecourts every Monday from now on. The day of action has been criticised by transport and environmental groups. Both the RAC and the Freight Transport Association expressed reservations about the boycott, as did Friends of the Earth and the Council for the Protection of Rural England. Transport minister Lord Whitty insisted the government was \"listening to motorists\" and understood the concerns of those in rural areas. \"There is a misapprehension behind this campaign and... it has been the increase in crude oil prices not the taxation which has increased the pump prices,\" he told Radio 4's Today programme. \"The chancellor recognised last year that the balance of taxation had gone far enough in terms of motoring and we held back on the fuel duty escalator,\" he added. Lord Whitty denied fuel tax was a regressive tax policy. \"The very poorest do not have access to a car. You do need to look at the totality of taxation.

      "body": "<p>Saddam Hussein began the Gulf war 10 years ago tomorrow when he launched his forces across the desert into Kuwait. Officially, the war ended seven months later with the liberation of Kuwait. Yet last week British and US planes were in action over northern and southern Iraq, as they have been for the past year and were the year before that.</p> <p>\"There is a sortie going on at the moment in the north and there is an engagement,\" a British commander said last week, describing how Iraqi anti-aircraft batteries locked on to a British jet.</p> <p>To him it was a routine day, one of many in a conflict which is under-reported, mainly because Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which provide the bases, do not want too much attention drawn to it.</p> <p>Iraq claims that more than 300 civilians were killed in raids in the past two years. The US and Britain, which send planes over Iraq on average every second day, insist that most of those listed as civilians were soldiers manning anti-aircraft weapons.</p> <p>British and US ships are also in the Gulf, trying - largely unsuccessfully - to police the embargo imposed on Iraq, the toughest sanctions regime in history.</p> <p>What has been achieved by 10 years of war and sanctions? President Saddam, 63, is still in power, presiding over a police state with one of the worst human rights records in the world.</p> <p>The 30-country coalition raised against him is falling apart as the Gulf states and others normalise their relations with Iraq. The sanctions are increasingly difficult to maintain. Iraq's borders with Jordan, Syria, Turkey and Iran are porous. Trade is increasing. Eighty countries plan to attend the Baghdad trade fair in November.</p> <p>Because of the sanctions' impact on civilians, the US and Britain face moral disapproval from a growing alliance of organisations as diverse as the Italian parliament and the Church of England.</p> <p>To those with money, just about anything is available in Baghdad's shops. The rest of Iraqi society is struggling, caught between President Saddam's tyranny and the implacable attitude of the US and Britain. Education is suffering as children drop out in droves. Income has been slashed. Iraq, which once boasted one of the best health services in the Middle East, now has one of the worst.</p> <p>Children have suffered disproportionately. Unesco estimates that half a million children have died in the past 10 years, partly as a result of malnutrition, poor sanitation and lack of medical services.</p> <p>The sanctions have left Iraq's infrastructure in an \"appalling\" state, the programme director for Save the Children in northern Iraq, Peter Maxwell, said.</p> <p>\"It is questionable whether the successful implementation of the UN's humanitarian programme should be made so dependent upon progress made in military and security matters.\"</p> <p>Church of England representatives were horrified by social conditions in Iraq. In a report last month they suggested that the UN should aim the arms embargo and financial sanctions at the ruling elite. \"Such an alternative might be more effective than the current sanctions policy, which is unlikely to yield further political dividend without creating further suffering.\"</p> <p>Publicly the US, the main proponent of sanctions, remains determined to put President Saddam and his cronies on trial for war crimes. But behind the rhetoric a change is taking place. Bill Clinton and those around him no longer insist that sanctions cannot be lifted until President Saddam has gone.</p> <p>Iraq's moment of truth, when it will show whether it will cooperate with the new team of UN weapons inspectors and get the sanctions suspended, is almost at hand, according to Hans Blix, the team's Swedish chairman. If it agrees to meet him,the conflict may be resolved. If it refuses, there will be another standoff with the UN.</p> <p>\"Towards the end of August we should be ready to open up in Iraq,\" Mr Blix told the Guardian. \"It is not in our mandate to harass, humiliate or provoke Iraq, and we shall not do that.\"</p> <p>Iraq complained that the previous team (Unscom) had an open agenda which meant that sanctions would never be lifted. Mr Blix said: \"We want to be firm but correct. We have given Iraq a marked trail towards suspension, so there's a path they can follow.\"</p> <p>The new team is not dominated by the west. \"The complaint that Unscom was lopsided in a western way is correct,\" Mr Blix said. Previous inspectors were not recruited by the UN, as the new team is, but seconded by their governments, and western states were more generous.</p> <p>The new team is also determined to avoid the accusation that it is a tool of western intelligence or Iraqi defectors.

      "bodyText": "Saddam Hussein began the Gulf war 10 years ago tomorrow when he launched his forces across the desert into Kuwait. Officially, the war ended seven months later with the liberation of Kuwait. Yet last week British and US planes were in action over northern and southern Iraq, as they have been for the past year and were the year before that. \"There is a sortie going on at the moment in the north and there is an engagement,\" a British commander said last week, describing how Iraqi anti-aircraft batteries locked on to a British jet. To him it was a routine day, one of many in a conflict which is under-reported, mainly because Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which provide the bases, do not want too much attention drawn to it. Iraq claims that more than 300 civilians were killed in raids in the past two years. The US and Britain, which send planes over Iraq on average every second day, insist that most of those listed as civilians were soldiers manning anti-aircraft weapons. British and US ships are also in the Gulf, trying - largely unsuccessfully - to police the embargo imposed on Iraq, the toughest sanctions regime in history. What has been achieved by 10 years of war and sanctions? President Saddam, 63, is still in power, presiding over a police state with one of the worst human rights records in the world. The 30-country coalition raised against him is falling apart as the Gulf states and others normalise their relations with Iraq. The sanctions are increasingly difficult to maintain. Iraq's borders with Jordan, Syria, Turkey and Iran are porous. Trade is increasing. Eighty countries plan to attend the Baghdad trade fair in November. Because of the sanctions' impact on civilians, the US and Britain face moral disapproval from a growing alliance of organisations as diverse as the Italian parliament and the Church of England. To those with money, just about anything is available in Baghdad's shops. The rest of Iraqi society is struggling, caught between President Saddam's tyranny and the implacable attitude of the US and Britain. Education is suffering as children drop out in droves. Income has been slashed. Iraq, which once boasted one of the best health services in the Middle East, now has one of the worst. Children have suffered disproportionately. Unesco estimates that half a million children have died in the past 10 years, partly as a result of malnutrition, poor sanitation and lack of medical services. The sanctions have left Iraq's infrastructure in an \"appalling\" state, the programme director for Save the Children in northern Iraq, Peter Maxwell, said. \"It is questionable whether the successful implementation of the UN's humanitarian programme should be made so dependent upon progress made in military and security matters.\" Church of England representatives were horrified by social conditions in Iraq. In a report last month they suggested that the UN should aim the arms embargo and financial sanctions at the ruling elite. \"Such an alternative might be more effective than the current sanctions policy, which is unlikely to yield further political dividend without creating further suffering.\" Publicly the US, the main proponent of sanctions, remains determined to put President Saddam and his cronies on trial for war crimes. But behind the rhetoric a change is taking place. Bill Clinton and those around him no longer insist that sanctions cannot be lifted until President Saddam has gone. Iraq's moment of truth, when it will show whether it will cooperate with the new team of UN weapons inspectors and get the sanctions suspended, is almost at hand, according to Hans Blix, the team's Swedish chairman. If it agrees to meet him,the conflict may be resolved. If it refuses, there will be another standoff with the UN. \"Towards the end of August we should be ready to open up in Iraq,\" Mr Blix told the Guardian. \"It is not in our mandate to harass, humiliate or provoke Iraq, and we shall not do that.\" Iraq complained that the previous team (Unscom) had an open agenda which meant that sanctions would never be lifted. Mr Blix said: \"We want to be firm but correct. We have given Iraq a marked trail towards suspension, so there's a path they can follow.\" The new team is not dominated by the west. \"The complaint that Unscom was lopsided in a western way is correct,\" Mr Blix said. Previous inspectors were not recruited by the UN, as the new team is, but seconded by their governments, and western states were more generous. The new team is also determined to avoid the accusation that it is a tool of western intelligence or Iraqi defectors. Iraq made this claim against Scott Ritter, an American member of Unscom. \"We will want to examine everything with a critical eye, because there is almost as much disinformation as there is information,\" Mr Blix said. \"Unscom had people with information from various groups and different channels. It's clear Ritter had channels directly, and I don't want to accept any of that. I want that to be under control.\" Mr Blix is a former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, with long experience of checking nuclear safeguards in closed societies. \"They [Iraqis] may believe sanctions will crumble . . . Many ministers have been visiting Baghdad and sympathising; but I have not seen any of them suggesting there should be a breach of sanctions.\" But the Iraqi deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz showed no sign of conciliation when visiting Moscow last week. \"There is nothing new regarding [UN] resolution 1284, [which set up the new team], which is still unacceptable because it does not provide any solution to the Iraqi cause.\" Despite the public intransigence on both sides, there is a 50-50 chance of a deal. In a significant change of tone, the British foreign minister Peter Hain provided the kind of assurances that those trying to achieve a deal have been looking for. \"Baghdad has to understand we are serious about wanting sanctions suspended, and all that is required is for the Iraq government to allow Blix's team in,\" Mr Hain said. When that happened, details of how the suspension of sanctions might be triggered could be discussed with the Iraqis. He denied that US-British policy towards Iraq had been a failure. \"The biggest achievement of the strategy is to contain Saddam Hussein. That is a very significant one. He has not invaded any country in the last 10 years.\" Meanwhile, the Gulf states are re-establishing diplomatic relations with Baghdad. Four - Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates - have done so this year. If a diplomatic compromise can be agreed and sanctions are lifted, Iraq, once one of the most economically successful countries, will take a long time to recover. Professor Anoush Ehteshami, director of Middle East studies at Durham University, said: \"You can rebuild the infrastructure in 20 years or so, but not the people.\" Turbulent decade 1990 Aug 2 Iraq invades Kuwait Aug 6 UN imposes sanctions 1991 Jan 16 US-led coalition launches air war against Iraq Feb 26 Allies retake Kuwait Feb 28 Ceasefire announced 1992 Aug 27 \"No-fly\" zone imposed over southern Iraq 1993 Jan 7 Allies attack missile sites and nuclear facility 1994 Nov 10 Saddam fully recognises Kuwait sovereignty 1996 Sep 4 Bill Clinton extends no-fly zone to Baghdad suburbs Nov 25 Iraq agrees oil-for-food deal with UN 1997 Nov 13-14 Iraq expels US members of UN arms inspectorate.

      "body": "<p>For nine years now 200 people in Switzerland have been totting up what promises to be the world's biggest bill: the compensation Iraq must pay for invading Kuwait. The final tally will not be known for three more years, but it is likely to be hundreds of billions of dollars.</p> <p>With a filing system that would cover half a football pitch, and running costs of $40m (\u00a327m) a year, the task of assessing the damage is huge. But if the history of war reparations is anything to go by, it is almost certainly futile.</p> <p>Like sanctions, Gulf war compensation is a well-intentioned idea gone wrong. The sums involved are so big that either Iraq will be burdened with the cost long after Saddam Hussein has gone or, more likely, it will stop paying and victims will see no more than a fraction of the money.</p> <p>Either way, deciding who should be compensated, and by how much, has turned into a bureaucratic and legal minefield for the UN compensation commission, the body set up to process claims.</p> <p>Nobody disputes that hundreds of thousands of innocent people suffered injuries or lost money as a result of the invasion, among them poor families in Egypt, India and elsewhere who depended on remittances from relatives working in Iraq or Kuwait.</p> <p>Thousands of businesses were hit, and governments suffered too. Jordan, for instance, which did not take part in the war, provided emergency medical facilities at its taxpayers' expense.</p> <p>When the war ended in 1991, Iraq agreed to pay compensation. Claims poured into the commission's headquarters in Geneva from as far afield as Bolivia, Iceland, Nepal, Panama, Thailand, Uruguay and Vietnam - 2.6m in all. They totalled $322bn.</p> <p>Among the more creative claims were several for backs allegedly injured by people packing their belongings to flee Kuwait, and one for candle burns sustained during a power cut.</p> <p>The commission rejected those, but did decide that heart attacks suffered outside Kuwait or Iraq could be compensated if they occurred up to six months after a war-related \"traumatic event\".</p> <p>The Pakistani government claimed $179m in lost tax revenue because it had allowed evacuees to bring their cars home without paying the normal import duty.</p> <p>That, too, was rejected, but when Israeli farmers claimed for flowers and fruit which could not be picked because of curfews and border closures, they were awarded $8m.</p> <p>The Canadian government claimed $47m, including $50,000 allegedly given to the Red Cross to set up an information bureau in Canada. Despite a request from the commission, it failed to provide evidence that the Red Cross had actually received the money.</p> <p>Similarly, British government claims totalling $6m were reduced to $499,000, mainly for lack of supporting evidence.</p> <p>The problem is not simply one of greedy claimants sniffing a honey pot; there are also losses clearly attributable to the war which fall outside the rules of compensation.</p> <p>Hotels and travel companies in several countries lost money during the conflict, through disrupted flights and cancelled bookings. The commission ruled that those in Cyprus, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco and Turkey could not be compensated, but awarded $14.7m to hotels and travel firms in Israel.</p> <p>The reasoning behind this was that there had been \"an actual and credible threat\" to Israel (in the form of 40 Scud missiles and statements by the Iraqi deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz) which was \"intimately connected\" to the invasion of Kuwait, whereas the other countries - regardless of their losses - had not faced a similar threat.</p> <p>The huge volume of claims, and in some cases the lack of documentation because of the war, means that verification can be difficult. Sources say that smaller claims are subjected to only random checks, while larger claims are examined by professional loss adjusters.</p> <p>In 1994 the commission reported that some duplicate claims for personal injuries had been found, though it did not say how many. It admitted that the ability of its computer system to detect these was limited, and urged governments (responsible for distributing the compensation to their citizens) to take their own precautions to avoid double payments.</p> <p>Iraqi officials believe there have been duplicate claims relating to businesses in Kuwait, where foreign investors are obliged to have a Kuwaiti partner. They say that if both partners claimed from different countries for the same loss, it would be particularly difficult for the system to detect.</p> <p>So far the commission has dealt with 2,588,014 claims and awarded $15.5bn compensation. The remaining 13,000 are mainly large government claims, including $111bn sought by the government of Kuwait and $48bn for environmental damage.

      "bodyText": "For nine years now 200 people in Switzerland have been totting up what promises to be the world's biggest bill: the compensation Iraq must pay for invading Kuwait. The final tally will not be known for three more years, but it is likely to be hundreds of billions of dollars. With a filing system that would cover half a football pitch, and running costs of $40m (\u00a327m) a year, the task of assessing the damage is huge. But if the history of war reparations is anything to go by, it is almost certainly futile. Like sanctions, Gulf war compensation is a well-intentioned idea gone wrong. The sums involved are so big that either Iraq will be burdened with the cost long after Saddam Hussein has gone or, more likely, it will stop paying and victims will see no more than a fraction of the money. Either way, deciding who should be compensated, and by how much, has turned into a bureaucratic and legal minefield for the UN compensation commission, the body set up to process claims. Nobody disputes that hundreds of thousands of innocent people suffered injuries or lost money as a result of the invasion, among them poor families in Egypt, India and elsewhere who depended on remittances from relatives working in Iraq or Kuwait. Thousands of businesses were hit, and governments suffered too. Jordan, for instance, which did not take part in the war, provided emergency medical facilities at its taxpayers' expense. When the war ended in 1991, Iraq agreed to pay compensation. Claims poured into the commission's headquarters in Geneva from as far afield as Bolivia, Iceland, Nepal, Panama, Thailand, Uruguay and Vietnam - 2.6m in all. They totalled $322bn. Among the more creative claims were several for backs allegedly injured by people packing their belongings to flee Kuwait, and one for candle burns sustained during a power cut. The commission rejected those, but did decide that heart attacks suffered outside Kuwait or Iraq could be compensated if they occurred up to six months after a war-related \"traumatic event\". The Pakistani government claimed $179m in lost tax revenue because it had allowed evacuees to bring their cars home without paying the normal import duty. That, too, was rejected, but when Israeli farmers claimed for flowers and fruit which could not be picked because of curfews and border closures, they were awarded $8m. The Canadian government claimed $47m, including $50,000 allegedly given to the Red Cross to set up an information bureau in Canada. Despite a request from the commission, it failed to provide evidence that the Red Cross had actually received the money. Similarly, British government claims totalling $6m were reduced to $499,000, mainly for lack of supporting evidence. The problem is not simply one of greedy claimants sniffing a honey pot; there are also losses clearly attributable to the war which fall outside the rules of compensation. Hotels and travel companies in several countries lost money during the conflict, through disrupted flights and cancelled bookings. The commission ruled that those in Cyprus, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco and Turkey could not be compensated, but awarded $14.7m to hotels and travel firms in Israel. The reasoning behind this was that there had been \"an actual and credible threat\" to Israel (in the form of 40 Scud missiles and statements by the Iraqi deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz) which was \"intimately connected\" to the invasion of Kuwait, whereas the other countries - regardless of their losses - had not faced a similar threat. The huge volume of claims, and in some cases the lack of documentation because of the war, means that verification can be difficult. Sources say that smaller claims are subjected to only random checks, while larger claims are examined by professional loss adjusters. In 1994 the commission reported that some duplicate claims for personal injuries had been found, though it did not say how many. It admitted that the ability of its computer system to detect these was limited, and urged governments (responsible for distributing the compensation to their citizens) to take their own precautions to avoid double payments. Iraqi officials believe there have been duplicate claims relating to businesses in Kuwait, where foreign investors are obliged to have a Kuwaiti partner. They say that if both partners claimed from different countries for the same loss, it would be particularly difficult for the system to detect. So far the commission has dealt with 2,588,014 claims and awarded $15.5bn compensation. The remaining 13,000 are mainly large government claims, including $111bn sought by the government of Kuwait and $48bn for environmental damage. If approved in full, they would bring Iraq's total bill to almost $284bn, but interest charges could easily double that. Iraq is currently paying the compensation, together with all the commission's running costs, by means of a 30% deduction from its revenue under the oil-for-food programme. The amount paid in this way varies with oil prices, but is around $400m a month. Once sanctions are lifted, however, there will be no sure way to collect the money. The Iraqis are already complaining about the way the claims have been dealt with. Some others say that the huge sums involved look punitive, even if they are not meant to be. They ask why future generations of Iraqis should bear the cost of President Saddam Hussein's desert folly.",

France's accident investigation bureau said on Sunday that the fire that downed the jet minutes after it took off from Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris was probably caused by a fuel leak rather than an engine problem. Following the discovery of fragments of tyre and part of a fuel tank on the runway, many experts now believe debris from a disintegrated wheel punctured the fuel tank on the Concorde's left wing and may also have been sucked into its port engines.

The discovery, by researchers at Hammersmith hospital, London, marks a significant step forward in efforts to solve the problems of rejection following transplant operations. The team found a way to block a response which causes the body to reject transplants by preventing a molecular reaction between the host and foreign cells. As a result, transplanted cells were no longer regarded by the body as foreign. Previous attempts to prevent the immune system rejecting transplant organs had an unfortunate effect on other parts of the immune system, leaving the patient unprotected against infection and disease. But researchers at Hammersmith, led by Professor Robert Lechler, discovered a way to allow the molecular interaction at the heart of the rejection re sponse to be stopped without harming the rest of the immune system. Prof Lechler said: \"Our first models using cells from the pancreas have been successful and we are now taking these findings on to further, more complex, models. \"Eventually we hope that using foreign organs in humans may start to solve the huge shortage of organ donors across the world.\" A solution to the problems of rejection of foreign organs would make it easier to use pig hearts, livers and kidneys to fill the gap left by the shortage of human donors. The acute shortage of organ donors worldwide means the number of patients in urgent need of spare part surgery outnumbers potential donors by 20 to 1. Lord Winston, director of research and development at Hammersmith, said: \"Several thousand people a year die awaiting organ transplants in this country and there are probably more patients who, because of the shortage of donors, never get on the waiting list.\"",

It was skippered by Adam Clackson, an experienced sailor in his late 50s and the owner of the yacht. His volunteer crew were all members of Cambridge University's cruising club who had responded to Mr Clackson's email to help him sail the Twister-class yacht from Holland to Britain.</p> <p>Last night the families of students Chris McMenemy, 26, Carol Smith, 23, and James Chew, 22 were waiting for news.</p> <p>Mark Clark, a spokesman for the maritime and coastguard agency said it was too soon to say whether the cushions were from the missing vessel.</p> <p>\"It was seen two days ago and we are not saying at this time that the debris has come from the ship,\" he added.</p> <p>Two days of searches involving British, Belgian and Dutch aircraft have yielded nothing.</p> <p>Kees Broekman, a senior watch officer with the Dutch coastguard based at Ijmuiden, said the search area was being extended from 1,600 to 3,000 square nautical miles off the Dutch coast.</p> <p>An RAF Nimrod aircraft, which scoured British territorial waters, and a Belgian plane which joined the search were hampered by poor visibility and found nothing.</p> <p>Mr Broekman said: \"Maybe she is still sailing, maybe she is in port somewhere, or gone down, its very difficult to say. The only thing we know is that she left on July 25th and after that nothing has been heard from it.\"</p> <p>Throughout yesterday the optimism of those searching for the craft and its crew was waning. One theory, that the Tuila suffered a power loss leaving it drifting and its VHF radio inoperative, was undermined when it emerged that the crew had three mobile phones aboard.</p> <p>Mr Clark said the mobile phones could not be called as no one seemed to have the numbers.</p> <p>The sighting of the debris off the Netherlands is the first major development in the two-day search for the Tuila.</p> <p>Of the three students, Miss Smith, a biochemistry postgraduate, is believed to have a coastal skipper's licence, which is granted by the Royal Yachting Association to sailors with more than 30 days, 800 miles and 12 hours of night sailing experience.</p> <p>Geography student Chris McMenemy has never sailed on the sea before.</p> <p>Peter Chew, the father of James, a pharmacology student from Wysall, Nottingham, said the family was still hopeful that the boat and its crew would be found.</p> <p>\"We are trying to stay optimistic, though it's hard at times,\" he said.</p>",

A massive air and sea search has failed to find the Tuila, which left the Dutch port of Ijmuiden last Tuesday, bound for the river Orwell near Harwich. The British coastguard announced yesterday that cushions of the same type and colour as those used on the Tuila had been spotted three days ago floating in the North Sea. The debris was sighted by the crew of a British motorcruiser 40 nautical miles off the Dutch coast. The 28-foot Tuila had four crew aboard. It was skippered by Adam Clackson, an experienced sailor in his late 50s and the owner of the yacht. His volunteer crew were all members of Cambridge University's cruising club who had responded to Mr Clackson's email to help him sail the Twister-class yacht from Holland to Britain. Last night the families of students Chris McMenemy, 26, Carol Smith, 23, and James Chew, 22 were waiting for news. Mark Clark, a spokesman for the maritime and coastguard agency said it was too soon to say whether the cushions were from the missing vessel. \"It was seen two days ago and we are not saying at this time that the debris has come from the ship,\" he added. Two days of searches involving British, Belgian and Dutch aircraft have yielded nothing. Kees Broekman, a senior watch officer with the Dutch coastguard based at Ijmuiden, said the search area was being extended from 1,600 to 3,000 square nautical miles off the Dutch coast. An RAF Nimrod aircraft, which scoured British territorial waters, and a Belgian plane which joined the search were hampered by poor visibility and found nothing. Mr Broekman said: \"Maybe she is still sailing, maybe she is in port somewhere, or gone down, its very difficult to say. The only thing we know is that she left on July 25th and after that nothing has been heard from it.\" Throughout yesterday the optimism of those searching for the craft and its crew was waning. One theory, that the Tuila suffered a power loss leaving it drifting and its VHF radio inoperative, was undermined when it emerged that the crew had three mobile phones aboard. Mr Clark said the mobile phones could not be called as no one seemed to have the numbers. The sighting of the debris off the Netherlands is the first major development in the two-day search for the Tuila. Of the three students, Miss Smith, a biochemistry postgraduate, is believed to have a coastal skipper's licence, which is granted by the Royal Yachting Association to sailors with more than 30 days, 800 miles and 12 hours of night sailing experience. Geography student Chris McMenemy has never sailed on the sea before. Peter Chew, the father of James, a pharmacology student from Wysall, Nottingham, said the family was still hopeful that the boat and its crew would be found. \"We are trying to stay optimistic, though it's hard at times,\" he said.",

Speaking to the Guardian, Lord Goldsmith, Tony Blair's personal negotiator in Brussels on the charter said yesterday \"radical improvements have been made, but we still need to make more progress\". The first full draft of the charter was published at the weekend. It is due to be endorsed by EU leaders in Nice at the end of the French presidency in December. Advocates of the charter see the proposal as a stalking horse for a written constitution for the European Union. However, the CBI and other business groups have been pressing ministers to dilute the charter, fearing it is an attempt to bring in EU style workers' rights through the back door. The TUC hopes the charter could be a vehicle to introduce long sought rights to company information.

Britain will incorporate the convention in October and is anxious that there should not be two competing sets of rights, leading to confusion and legal mayhem. The draft still suggests the EU charter takes precedence where it offers greater or more extensive protection than the European convention.

But now that marriage, and Arianna's stint as a Republican stalwart, are over.</p> <p>She is the Madonna of politics, utterly remade: author of books on overthrowing the government, champion of the oppressed - the substance to this shadowy event.</p> <p>Her idea is to get America's best reforming pressure groups together for five days and have them discuss the real issues - drugs, election finance, poverty - you won't hear mentioned down the road by Mr Card's cue-card sharps. And it is a good idea because Arianna is a formidable organiser, not like those Seattle anarchists \"who can't organise anything\".</p> <p>Most of the demos here are ragtag amateur: Ms Huffington, in her pencil-slim designer trouser suits, is a pro. You expect to find Tina Brown and Anna Wintour playing groupies.</p> <p>Why did John McCain agree to be her first speaker, the big, mainstream prize at the alternative party? Probably because she pinned him down at another party. But here he was, centre stage, looking strangely uneasy, shirt collar a size too small, eyes rivetted to the script in front of him. Mr McCain, off the cuff, is a wonderful, funny speaker. That was the strength of his \"insurgency\" which, for a time, made George W and the money-men quake.</p> <p>Now, though, the senator is strangely cowed, the victim of too many TV interviews pledging fealty to Mr Bush, and too many backroom sessions telling his pledged delegates to jump a sunken ship.</p> <p>He talked flatly of national pride and self-respect and a cleansed democracy. A packed hall cheered indulgently. Collar shrinking again, eyes bowed, he said that the best hope for reform was Mr Bush, a fine candidate who believed in education and social security and ... And then they were booing and jeering. \"Blancmange! Blancmange!\"</p> <p>Actually, it turned out to be \"Black Mesa\", a patch of New Mexico rich in open-cast coal, where the Navajo's Dine Indians live, thus impeding mining and corporate enrichment. But the hero of Vietnam probably heard only the din.</p> <p>\"If you like ... I do not have to continue,\" he said, quavering. Enter Arianna, a battle cruiser at full steam. \"This is the convention at which we hear everybody with respect,\" she rasped, steering Mr McCain back to the podium.</p> <p>He stumbled briefly through the rest of a text about the duties incumbent on \"those of us who have grown old in public service\" and scarpered back to the Prozac tranquillity of the main convention (where, tonight, his George W encomium will be rapturously received).</p> <p>Interesting questions. What on earth is McCain playing at? What (except perhaps the chance of running again in 2004 if George gets whacked) is there in it for him, a half-shuffling rebel, half-muzzled team player? He's found a memory hole in the middle, and he's dropping down it.</p> <p>Will the forces of American reform ever come together to look, in Arianna's plangent vision, \"not left, not right - but forward\"? Don't bank on it. Falling out, spoiling the party, is so much more fun. But at least there is life and verve and Ms Huffington to discuss this week.</p> <p>At least somebody's talking about the half-million or so drug offenders behind bars here (more than the entire prison population of western Europe). At least somebody's bringing over the street people of Camden (the urban dump across the Delaware) as testaments to a society which is not working.</p> <p>Some 622 of the delegates here are white and just 21 black.</p> <p>Their votes are rolling already, strung over four days to avoid boring the viewers. But they are not the world, even Arianna's new world. She should bring her road show to Blackpool and see how it plays.</p>",

But now that marriage, and Arianna's stint as a Republican stalwart, are over. She is the Madonna of politics, utterly remade: author of books on overthrowing the government, champion of the oppressed - the substance to this shadowy event. Her idea is to get America's best reforming pressure groups together for five days and have them discuss the real issues - drugs, election finance, poverty - you won't hear mentioned down the road by Mr Card's cue-card sharps. And it is a good idea because Arianna is a formidable organiser, not like those Seattle anarchists \"who can't organise anything\". Most of the demos here are ragtag amateur: Ms Huffington, in her pencil-slim designer trouser suits, is a pro. You expect to find Tina Brown and Anna Wintour playing groupies. Why did John McCain agree to be her first speaker, the big, mainstream prize at the alternative party? Probably because she pinned him down at another party. But here he was, centre stage, looking strangely uneasy, shirt collar a size too small, eyes rivetted to the script in front of him. Mr McCain, off the cuff, is a wonderful, funny speaker. That was the strength of his \"insurgency\" which, for a time, made George W and the money-men quake. Now, though, the senator is strangely cowed, the victim of too many TV interviews pledging fealty to Mr Bush, and too many backroom sessions telling his pledged delegates to jump a sunken ship. He talked flatly of national pride and self-respect and a cleansed democracy. A packed hall cheered indulgently. Collar shrinking again, eyes bowed, he said that the best hope for reform was Mr Bush, a fine candidate who believed in education and social security and ... And then they were booing and jeering. \"Blancmange! Blancmange!\" Actually, it turned out to be \"Black Mesa\", a patch of New Mexico rich in open-cast coal, where the Navajo's Dine Indians live, thus impeding mining and corporate enrichment. But the hero of Vietnam probably heard only the din. \"If you like ... I do not have to continue,\" he said, quavering. Enter Arianna, a battle cruiser at full steam. \"This is the convention at which we hear everybody with respect,\" she rasped, steering Mr McCain back to the podium. He stumbled briefly through the rest of a text about the duties incumbent on \"those of us who have grown old in public service\" and scarpered back to the Prozac tranquillity of the main convention (where, tonight, his George W encomium will be rapturously received). Interesting questions. What on earth is McCain playing at? What (except perhaps the chance of running again in 2004 if George gets whacked) is there in it for him, a half-shuffling rebel, half-muzzled team player? He's found a memory hole in the middle, and he's dropping down it. Will the forces of American reform ever come together to look, in Arianna's plangent vision, \"not left, not right - but forward\"? Don't bank on it. Falling out, spoiling the party, is so much more fun. But at least there is life and verve and Ms Huffington to discuss this week. At least somebody's talking about the half-million or so drug offenders behind bars here (more than the entire prison population of western Europe). At least somebody's bringing over the street people of Camden (the urban dump across the Delaware) as testaments to a society which is not working. Some 622 of the delegates here are white and just 21 black. Their votes are rolling already, strung over four days to avoid boring the viewers. But they are not the world, even Arianna's new world. She should bring her road show to Blackpool and see how it plays.",

      "bodyText": "Amid all the paraphernalia and glitz of modern democracy, the Republican party launched an essentially an old-fashioned dynastic restoration yesterday with a national convention in Philadelphia aimed at putting a Bush back in power. When the meticulously orchestrated convention formally adopts George W Bush on Thursday, it will be the third time a Bush has been a presidential nominee in the past 12 years, a record not even the Kennedys can match. Familiar faces from the last Bush administration, or the court of George I, as some of the family's critics have dubbed it, were on prominent display at the convention, a reflection of the importance the family ascribes to loyalty. The theme song for the opening ceremonies was Stand By Me. Foremost among those faces was Dick Cheney, the elder George's defence secretary and the younger's vice-presidential candidate. He arrived in town in advance of the Texas governor, who will make only one triumphal appearance in the convention hall - to accept the nomination at the climactic last moment. Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under George the elder, was given a prime-time slot on the podium, appearing soon after the candidate's wife, Laura Bush. The retired general was there as a symbol of both the future and the past. His speech on the politics of inclusion, coming from a black American success story, was aimed at attracting minorities. But his presence, alongside Mr Cheney, also harked back to the finest hour of the 1988-92 Bush presidency - victory in the Gulf war. Republican officials said that, if elected, Governor Bush was likely to give Mr Powell a senior post in his cabinet, probably secretary of state. Mr Powell has hinted that he would accept, giving a second Bush administration an uncanny resemblance to the first, particularly in matters of foreign and military policy. The \"back-to-the-future\" look is intended to reassure voters concerned about Mr Bush's lack of experience at the national level. Today's spotlight will be on Condoleezza Rice, who has served both father and son as a foreign policy adviser, and who, as an African-American, will be a further important asset in recasting the Bush brand to make it appear more inclusive and accessible. Mr Bush has never made any attempt to disguise his anger and disillusion over what he saw as the betrayal of his father in 1992, the year of Bill Clinton's first victory. He recently described watching former aides \"jumping out the windows in 1992, looking for the next campaign\". Elizabeth Mitchell, a Bush biographer, argues in her book W: Revenge of the Bush Dynasty, that the desire for revenge against the Clinton camp and the hard-edged Republican establishment is the psychological driving force behind the campaign. But the former president, who was in Philadelphia yesterday for the launch of the convention, played down the vengeance theory. \"This is not about my legacy here. It's not about vindication,\" he said in an interview published in Newsweek yesterday. \"We feel the pride any mother and father would feel if their kid was a candidate for president.\" The Bush presence in Philadelphia yesterday was big enough to be spread across three hotels. The elder Bush and his court took up residence in the Rittenhouse, the candidate's brother and Florida governor, Jeb Bush, moved into the Loews, hotel, while the candidate installed his team in the Wyndham Franklin Plaza. Also on view was the latest Bush political venture: George P Bush, Jeb's son and the candidate's nephew. The 24-year-old, whose mother is Mexican, is popular with Hispanics and has been a highly visible ambassador for his uncle's brand of diversity and inclusion.",

      "bodyText": "Rising demand for net-enabled mobile phones should revive the fortunes of electronics company Filtronic after it posted a pre-tax loss of \u00a33.9m, according to its chairman. Shares in the company, which makes electronic components for mobile handsets and military weapons, rose 40p to 887.5p as house broker Cazenove &amp; Co said it expected the company to report a pre-tax profit of \u00a315m in 2001.The company delivered a \u00a312.5m pre-tax profit in 1999. Filtronic's 2000 earnings suffered a slowdown because of reduced component sales in its wireless infrastructure division because of product launch delays at big US customers Motorola and Lucent. Earnings were also dragged into the red by the growing interest bill Filtronic has on a $170m high-yield debt which matures in December 2005. Sales in the year rose 18.7% to \u00a3222.3m. The company has five divisions of which the largest two, wireless infrastructure and cellular handset products, account for 85% of the group's turnover. Filtronic expects the growth in third generation mobile phones in the next few years and its strong position in internal antennas for mobiles to drive profit growth. Professor David Rhodes, executive chairman of Filtronic, said: \"The growth prospects of our new business areas, together with those of the more established businesses, give the board great confidence that Filtronic will provide its shareholders with outstanding and sustainable growth.\" The group's \u00a330m spend on opening its semiconductor factory in Newton Aycliffe, Co Durham, is also expected to drive growth in the next 12 months as the company begins to announce contract wins. Analysts said semiconductor business had not been factored in to current valuations. Filtronic's share price has fallen from more than \u00a323 in February.",

However, yesterday Oftel said BT should be ready to take orders from September from other operators who want to install their equipment in BT's exchanges and use BT's lines to provide high speed services to customers. \"Oftel expects progressive roll-out with unbundled loops available in volume by the middle of next year,\" the telecoms regulator said in a statement. BT's network is being upgraded with digital subscriber line services that will permit high-speed internet access and video-on-demand facilities. Oftel has estimated it should only take BT four months to accommodate an initial operator on one of its loops and then four weeks for subsequent competitors. The draft ruling from Oftel also warned BT that it must not give undue preference to its own business against other operators. It said BT must ensure that other operators are able to compete on the same terms as BT, namely in pricing, when delivering high bandwidth services.

Ade Ajibulu of telecoms consultants Analysys, was sceptical that the Oftel's draft guidelines for unbundling the local loop could be enforced. \"There's a general problem of unequal knowledge,\" Mr Ajibulu said. \"If you are another telecoms operator, you don't know the quality [of line] that BT is providing to its own [businesses] compared with the quality of the copper line you have, making it very difficult to do anything.\" He said the market would have to be carefully monitored by Oftel. \"The incumbent operators try to protect what they see as their best interests and this makes the process of unbundling quite difficult for their competitors.\"",

      "bodyText": "A high court judge yesterday decided that a violent teenager accused of assaulting staff and fellow pupils should not be allowed to return to his Essex school, in a key ruling hailed by teaching unions as \"a victory for common sense\". The move came as the government prepares today to announce tougher regulations that will order local education authorities not to override head teachers' decisions to permanently exclude pupils who have been involved in serious violence or drug dealing. Jacqui Smith, the schools minister, is expected to tell a teachers' conference today that the appeals panels run by education authorities have no right to interfere in schools' disciplinary policies by ordering unruly pupils back to class. The case which triggered yesterday's high court ruling underlined the concerns of the teaching unions, which have lobbied ministers about the way their powers to exclude unruly pupils are often undermined by \"perverse\" decisions made by appeal panels. At the same time, schools are under pressure from tough targets introduced by David Blunkett, the education secretary, which require the number of permanently excluded pupils to be cut from more than 12,000 to 9,000 by 2002. The case yesterday involved a 14-year old boy who had been permanently excluded from the 1,200-pupil school in Essex, in December last year, after he had allegedly hit a pupil in the dinner queue. But the appeals committee of the local education authority ruled the boy should be reinstated.

HSBC, which has taken steps to make its mortgage products more customer-friendly, attributed its larger than expected profits rise in the first six months of the year to the global nature of its business and the quality of its products. \"People are beginning to trust us ... and trust leads to margin,\" said Douglas Flint, the finance director. Profits figures for the first six months of the year were higher than the City had been expecting, in part because HSBC had released 40% of the $290m special provision it had made to cover potential bad debts incurred during the Asian financial crisis three years ago. Because economic condi tions in the region are improving, analysts believe HSBC will be able to realise the remaining part of that special provision in the final six months of the year. HSBC's shares closed at 9.03p, up 18.5p to a new high. Mr Whitson indicated that the bank's recent acquisition trail across the globe might slow a little although he said the bank would continue to look at potential opportunities. \"Several\" proposals a day about potential deals were made to the bank, although he appeared to rule out the bank joining the difficult consolidation which German banks are trying to achieve. HSBC in the past year has bolstered its business in the US by buying Republic New York and Safra, both banks which make their money from affluent private clients, as does French bank Credit Commercial de France which it took control of last week. Under the terms of that last deal, it sold the securities arm of CCF's Charterhouse business to ING for \u00a3127m yesterday. The bank is also involved in a $1bn online private banking venture with Merrill Lynch of the US. HSBC, which has share listings in London, Hong Kong, New York and Paris, will pay a 15 cent interim dividend. The HSBC.com online bank will start in Britain next week.",

      "bodyText": "Monsoon, the women's clothing retailer, is to open five new stores in Britain and expand into the United States and Saudi Arabia despite a lacklustre performance on the high street. Ten shops will be relocated in bigger premises and the Accessorize brand will move into markets such as Turkey, South Africa and Japan. The plans were unveiled by the London-based company following a 13% increase in pre-tax profits to \u00a323m for the year to May 27. Like for like sales in Monsoon and Accessorize increased but management ad mitted it was unot as strong as it would have liked. Chairman Peter Simon said: \"We still have some way to go to regain lost ground and restore our pre-eminent position on the high street. Until we do, we will be cautious about our expansion plans.\" Monsoon shares ended the day down 3p at 68p and have increased by 50% during the last 18 months. This followed a disastrous period after its debut in early 1998 at 200p when the stock plunged to 45p. Following poor sales performances Monsoon has been clawing its way back by restructuring its design and buying teams and pushing its Accessorize outlets. The accessory business was the jewel in the crown of the 1999-2000 results, with 20 stores being opened and the successful launch of its first overseas franchise, in Greece. Foreign business at present accounts for just 7% of Monsoon's overall turnover and has been identified as an important area for growth. Overseas earnings were hit last year by the strength of sterling, but exchange rate problems will be reduced in future by a switch to dollar buying of supplies. Analysts were encouraged by the surge in second half sales, but there was concern at the rising costs of Monsoon's rents, rates and labour.",

The result, on both sides of the Atlantic, is still with us. Eight years later it is the conservatives who are looking for means to overthrow well entrenched centre-left foes. This week William Hague has crossed the ocean to Philadelphia in search of enlightenment from the Republican convention. He is anxious to associate himself with George W Bush and to hitch his \"common sense revolution\" to the Republican hopeful's message of \"compassionate conservatism\". Yesterday Mr Hague went as close as protocol allows to endorsing Mr Bush, and admitted that British Conservatives still had something to learn from the international links forged by Mr Clinton, Mr Blair and their fellow advocates of the third way. \"It is not for me to tell the voters of America how to vote, but let me say this: George W Bush is an impressive man with a proud record,\" Mr Hague told a meeting of international conservatives. \"We wish him well.\" Whether Mr Bush is even aware that the Conservative leader is in town has to be open to doubt. He does not arrive in Philadelphia until tonight, two days before his presidential nomination acceptance speech, and Mr Hague had no meetings scheduled with leading Republicans before he flew back to Britain last night. The Conservative party hierarchy is in Philadelphia in force. Up to a dozen senior Tories are in town, and the shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maud, is expected later in the week. Most intriguing of all, the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, arrived at the weekend on a \"private visit\", which took some Tory officials by surprise. Mr Hague presided yesterday over a one-day meeting of the International Democratic Union, a global alliance of conservative parties. Perhaps symbolically, it was held at Valley Forge, where George Washington's rebel army endured the nadir of its fortunes. He admitted that the centre-left had taught the conservatives several lessons during the 1990s. \"Perhaps because our victory over the old left was so complete, we allowed our selves to become complacent,\" he said. \"We were slow to see that the left was reinventing itself.

Mr Hague met Mr Bush in Texas last year, but he is in much closer touch with the Republican nominee's younger brother, the Florida governor Jeb Bush, with whom he exchanges emails almost weekly. Nevertheless, some of Mr Hague's aides, including the former MP Sebastian Coe and the Conservative party director of policy Danny Finkelstein, believe that George W Bush has pioneered a way for the Conservatives to counter Labour on social issues such as health and education.",

Certainly, the show's risqu\u00e9 tone has far more in common with the scabrously hilarious gross-out humour of South Park than more traditional live action sitcoms such as, say, Friends or Frasier. In one of the series' earliest episodes, for example, Macdonald's character - a womanising ice-hockey player forced to work as a social worker after being caught fiddling his taxes - refused to return a dog he had found to its rightful owner. When the latter complained that he couldn't just take his mutt, Macdonald taunted him with the words \"Hey, I'm a social worker - we can take your children!\" </p> <p>Subsequent shows, meanwhile, have found Norm hiring a prostitute to work as the office secretary, provoking his boss to go on a homicidal gun- toting rampage and chowing down, albeit accidentally, on a platter of marijuana-laden food. Few wonders then, that when the show debuted early in 1999, the National Association of Social Workers picketed ABC, objecting to the fact that its lead character is professionally unqualified, frequently belittles those who come to his office seeking help, and has \"dirty sex\" with clients. \"You can't just walk off the street and become a social worker,\" said NASW board member John Edwards. After initially dismissing the problem (\"Angry social workers? Sounds pretty dangerous...\"), Macdonald's subsequent rebuttal was typically deadpan: \"Hey, I'm just pretending. It's make-believe. How about those shows with aliens?\" </p> <p>But there is another sense in which ABC's khazi-oriented ad seems appropriate. For the career of Macdonald himself has often seemed to be heading down the toilet. Actually, the Canadian-born comedian was something of a late starter in the first place, with jobs as a lumberjack and oil-field worker before starting to appear at Ottawa clubs in his mid-20s. \"I always wanted to be the class clown,\" he would later claim. \"But my parents couldn't afford the big shoes.\" </p> <p>With his wide-eyed shambling stage persona, which neatly hid an immaculate sense of timing, Macdonald soon began to turn industry heads, and bagged himself a job on Saturday Night Live hosting the show's topical News Update slot, which had previously made stars out of Chevy Chase and Macdonald's friend Dennis Miller. Armed with his own range of idiosyncratic catchphrases (\"And now... the fake news\", \"Crack whore!\"), Macdonald soon gained a massive following for this weekly tirade against the great, the good and, more often that not, OJ Simpson. </p> <p>\"This week at the OJ Simpson civil trial,\" Macdonald could be heard intoning on January 11, 1997, \"the focus shifted from the defendant to the alleged character flaws of Nicole Brown Simpson. Attorneys for OJ hammered away at her lifestyle, citing sexual promiscuity, drug use and the fact she married a double murderer...\" </p> <p>One person who didn't appreciate Macdonald's acerbic sense of humour, however, was NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer, who summarily fired the comedian from Weekend Update in January 1998. When asked by the comedian for a reason, Ohlmeyer explained: \"You're not funny.\" Given that Macdonald was undoubtedly one of the show's few genuine talents, this assessment seemed a tad bizarre, and many media commentators were soon pointing to Ohlmeyer's close friendship with a certain OJ Simpson (Ohlmeyer himself has continually refuted this accusation). </p> <p>Fortunately, by this time Macdonald had already signed on to star in a brace of films.

The inquiry by the inspectorate of constabulary said that variations in police methods in recording crime meant the level should be 20% higher than the picture presented by the official figures published each year. The twice yearly British crime survey, which asks people about their experience of crime, has long demonstrated that the true level of crime in England and Wales is approximately 20m crimes a year, while the police record approximately 5m offences. The Home Office minister, Charles Clarke, has decided that, while the police figures will never reflect the actual amount of crime, it is time to try to bring greater accuracy and consistency to the way that the recorded rate is officially compiled. The recorded crime figures are crucial in the distribution of the \u00a37bn a year police budget and in determining public attitudes to crime. Mr Clarke yesterday published proposals for an overhaul: \"We've got 43 different forces doing different things according to different traditions, with different computer systems in quite different ways. \"Some record on the basis of allegations made. Some record on the basis of requiring a certain degree of evidence. The level of comparability seems very poor across the country. It seems completely dotty, which is why we are setting about changing it.\" Studies by the police inspectorate published yesterday, alongside proposals to reform the way statistics were collected, also showed that some forces had been massaging their figures so they depressed the recorded crime rate in their area and raised their detection or clear-up rate. Offences were often wrongly classified as less serious crimes; there was inappropriate \"no-criming\" (or writing-off) of an offence after it had been recorded; and there was a failure to record the correct number of crimes, with an error rate of 15% to 65%. The study, On the Record, said that while some forces had been models of good practice, cases were found of crimes not being recorded when they had been reported to the police, delays in the recording of reported crimes until they were detected, and numerous problems with the classifying of crimes, such as car crime and house burglaries, for which there were national reduction targets. It also said there were clear cases where the quality of evidence used to justify a crime being marked down as \"cleared up\" was far less than the evidence which was needed to justify it being officially \"recorded\". The report by Keith Povey, one of the constabulary inspectors, said that a clear statement from chief constables was needed to leave officers in no doubt that the \"unethical recording of crime is not supported by the force and is in direct contravention of standards set down by chief officers\". Mr Clarke said the police should adopt a twin-track system to record crime: making a formal record of all incidents or allegations reported by victims; and recording all offences in which the police believed there was sufficient evidence to justify them being recorded as a crime.",

Strategically the deal looks good. New fields balance the portfolio by adding assets in the mature North Sea. </p> <p>Tullow has moved to strengthen its management by bringing in former Pict Petroleum boss John Lander and his finance director, Brian Williams, to run the show in the UK. </p> <p>The question for investors, however, is whether Tullow has overpaid. It is certainly a full price, although managing director Aidan Heavey believes there is plenty of scope for new gas finds. </p> <p>The Tullow share price has never been as badly dented as many of its rivals by investor antipathy.

      "bodyText": "Tullow Oil yesterday demonstrated that the stock market is warming to the exploration and production sector - and not before time, given 18 months of high oil prices. The sector has a record of disappointing investors, but a placing and open offer was oversubscribed when Tullow needed \u00a342m to back a \u00a3201m deal with BP Amoco. Schroders and Prudential have backed the Irish-based minnow - which has effectively doubled in size as a result of the transaction. Hydrocarbon output is set to increase fivefold to the equivalent of 25,000 barrels of oil and revenues to grow from \u00a35m this year to \u00a3125m. Tullow's shares were suspended last night but on the basis of Friday's 63.5p close, the enlarged firm will have a capitalisation of around \u00a3211m, meaning it is now bigger than Premier Oil. It is a turnaround for Tullow, until now best known for speculative enterprises in developing countries. The new assets involve interests in 16 southern North Sea gas fields BP is selling in order to win regulatory approval for its takeover of Atlantic Richfield. Strategically the deal looks good. New fields balance the portfolio by adding assets in the mature North Sea. Tullow has moved to strengthen its management by bringing in former Pict Petroleum boss John Lander and his finance director, Brian Williams, to run the show in the UK. The question for investors, however, is whether Tullow has overpaid. It is certainly a full price, although managing director Aidan Heavey believes there is plenty of scope for new gas finds. The Tullow share price has never been as badly dented as many of its rivals by investor antipathy. They have managed to ride relatively high on the back of excitement caused by its expected winning of the prime block nine in Bangladesh. Tullow shares should be boosted by its plan to reregister in the UK. But it is probably safer just to \"hold\" rather than \"buy\" at the current price.",

The special immigration appeals commission ruled that Mukhtiar Singh and Paramjit Singh faced \"a real risk of being subjected to torture\", contrary to the European convention on human rights. However, in a judgment which leaves the Home Office in an embarrassing quandary, the commission rejected their claim for refugee status because they were \"international terrorists\" and a danger to \"national security\". The ruling has widespread implications for the government's new terrorism bill as well as the Home Office's broad new definition of what, and who, constitutes a threat to Britain's security. Lawyers and Whitehall officials said the ruling also raised questions about why the two men were refused refugee status in light of the commission's finding that they had \"a well-founded fear of being prosecuted for reasons of political opinion if returned to India\".

      "body": "<p>The voice goes right through me, though I don't understand a word. In fact, there are no words - only cries, sobs, ululations, knots and overlays of sound. A voice from the gut, the tongue and the throat, both alien and expressive, for all the dubbing, the loops and layered cross-currents. I comprehend nothing, but the voice is filled with feeling. </p> <p>The first time I heard it, the hairs rose on my neck, my stomach tightened, I felt winded. A woman stood alone in an empty theatre, black chador against blackness, her face and hands illuminated, bending towards and away from the microphone. It was the Iranian composer and singer Sussan Deyhim, performing in Shirin Neshat's two-screen video/sound installation Turbulent, one of a trio of works Neshat is now showing at London's Serpentine Gallery. Deyhim's is a voice of great authority and reserve, and the sense of what is held back is as important as what is vocalised. In Turbulent she is completely unleashed, almost terrifying in her intensity. </p> <p>She is watched, from a screen on the other side of the room, by a man, who has just sung a devotional love song. He has an audience of other men, although he has performed with his back to them. I cannot tell if the song - a 13th-century Sufi poem - is addressed to me, to the woman on the screen on the further side of the room, or to God. The nature of the song's passion is less important than the fact of passion itself. </p> <p>Turbulent is a film about song against song, and the relative places of men and women in present-day Iranian society (the male voice is that of Shahram Nazeri, a Kurdish Iranian singer much loved in Iran. The actor in the film, a friend of Neshat's, is lip-synching). </p> <p>Turbulent won a prize at last year's Venice Biennale. It has been shown in Britain before, and can also be seen at Edinburgh's Fruitmarket Gallery. It deserves its continuing success as a singular, unforgettable art work. But it is not even the best of the three thematically related installations now showing at the Serpentine, together with a series of earlier photographs of women wearing the chador, some holding guns and rifles, all of them drawn over with Islamic text and calligraphy. </p> <p>All three of Neshat's video works here are shot on black-and-white film and directed by the artist herself (with superb photographic direction by Ghasem Ebrahimian). Although transferred to video, the works remain intrinsically filmic, and have a rather old-fashioned quality. Neshat has spoken of the influence of recent Iranian cinema, citing Abbas Kiarostami, director of A Taste of Cherry, as well as Hitchcock's The Birds. Her video installations are, in effect, stories, or rather fragments of stories - rudimentary but complex situations. Images from the work Rapture keep coming back to me: women revealing their legs as they lift their black robes to push a boat into the sea; bare feet dancing on a drum; men lifting ladders in a narrow, shadowed street, the ladders catching the light in the air above. </p> <p>But it is the newest work, Fervor, that really excites me. A man and a woman meet at a crossroads in the country, passing in different directions. They are divided as much as brought together by the crossing of the roads, the slanting light, the vertiginous camera angles duplicated and reversed on the two adjacent screens. The meeting of their gazes cleaves them apart. Later, they see one another at a public meeting in a courtyard in a town, where a male speaker on a stage rants and bellows, railing against the sins of the flesh. </p> <p>I cannot tell if the responses from the crowd, sometimes passing like a wind over a field, sometimes a roar, are of assent or disapproval. His message is familiar: \"Woe unto the sinful, woe unto you. Dread and beware.\" The same exhortations the priest made in Joyce's Portrait of The Artist as a Young Man: \"Beware the day of judgment.\" The man and woman, seated amid single-sex crowds divided by a curtain, look at each other once again. The woman leaves. That's it. That's all there is, but then again, that's not it at all. Fervor, as much as it is about male authority, is about yearning and impossibility, the power of the eye and the power of words. It is also, I think, about the loss of what one has never truly possessed. </p> <p> Affecting though they are, Neshat's recent works come with complications. In fact, they are about complications, difficulties, ambivalences. Born in Iran, the 43-year-old artist was sent to America for her education in the years before the Iranian theocratic revolution. Although she has since attempted to work in Iran, she is based in the US, and her films are largely shot in Turkey and Morocco. Refusing to regard herself as an exile, she says she is \"distanced\" from Iran, although there are official cultural factions in Tehran who would welcome her return. </p> <p>What we in the West frequently regard as social iniquities and barbarities - especially in relation to the place of women - are treated with a certain ambivalence in Neshat's work. In a talk she gave at the Serpentine at the weekend, Neshat was castigated for not being feminist enough, radical enough, overtly critical enough. Accused of not doing what she never set out to do - of not taking a more European or American view of her native country - she insisted that she was simply an artist. </p> <p>One of Neshat's strengths is her refusal to forsake her ambivalence in favour of a simple, and largely politically correct, message. We seem, in the west, to talk of Islam and Islamic cultures in simplistic terms. Edward Said once remarked that westerners come up against \"the orient\" as Americans or Europeans first, and as individuals second. Neshat's work opens up other possibilities, though she is no apologist. As an artist, she describes, invents, analyses and prods situations as an individual first of all. </p> <p>Yet what can I bring to a body of work whose entire force and inner complexity depends on its relationship to post-revolutionary Iran, and its references to Sufism and Persian history - works that are made from the position, if not of exile, then of distance, and its own kind of yearning? This is the position, I suspect, that most of Neshat's audience find themselves in, as well as beguiled and entranced. I left this show filled with emotion, but I didn't know its nature, or what it meant. </p> <p>\u0095 Shirin Neshat is at the Serpentine Gallery, London SE1 (020-7298 1515), till September 3. Turbulent is at the Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh (0131-225 2383), till September 23.</p>",

      "body": "<p>You don't so much interview composer Judith Weir as marvel as her beautiful mind roves from subject to subject. At one point, our conversation swerves to her passion for Brahms. \"Every time I hear him,\" she says, lost in wonderment, \"I just want to go and compose again.\" </p> <p>Wonderment is a quality that hangs over much of Weir's music - and not least her new work, woman.life.song, which will receive its British premiere at the Proms on Sunday. The piece is a remarkable collaboration between five women, of whom Weir is one. The others are soprano Jessye Norman, the writers Maya Angelou and Toni Morrison, and Clarissa Pinkola Estes, the Jungian psychoanalyst and mythologist, author of the hugely successful Women Who Run with the Wolves. \"It was Jessye Norman's idea,\" says Weir. \"She was asked to commission a piece for Carnegie Hall. She wanted a work that told the story of a woman's life. Perhaps she was thinking of another Frauenliebe und Leben.\" </p> <p>That work, whose title means Woman's Love and Life, is a song cycle by Schumann, which Norman has recorded, as have many great divas. Whether or not comparisons between the two works are intentional, they will inevitably be drawn. Woman.life.song forms a radical counter to Schumann's cycle, which now comes over as one of the more dodgy expos\u00e9s of the heterosexual male mind. The text, by the German Romantic poet Adalbert von Chamisso, presupposes the absolute dependence of women on men. The \"life\" of Schumann's unnamed heroine begins not with birth, but at the moment she sees the man who will give her existence meaning; her fulfilment consists in marriage and in bearing his child; her life is effectively over when he dies, and all she is left with is memory. \"I don't like the ending,\" Weir says. \"I don't like the way it just cuts off. Then the piano comes back with the melody of the first song.\" </p> <p>Woman.life.song is very different. Does Weir consider the work explicitly feminist? \"You'd better ask Jessye that.\" Weir smiles enigmatically. The feminist credentials of the writers involved are impeccable. \"It steps completely aside from the male tradition, certainly,\" says Weir. \"Around the time of the Carnegie Hall premiere in March, four of us went on an intellectual TV chat-show. I remember it was Estes who said, 'When women do a big project like this, it's very rare.' \" </p> <p>It is Estes's words - a rhapsodic stream of consciousness - that form the bulk of the text, though not, perhaps, its kernel. Her loquacity sets her apart from the concision of Morrison and Angelou. \"In retrospect,\" Weir says, \"I realise that much of the dynamic comes from the contrast between Estes and the other two. Angelou very much wrote prose, while Morrison came up with beautifully crafted lyrics. I had to cut some of Estes's text down.\" Norman, it would seem, had decided which writer was to cover which aspect of her heroine's life. \"I don't know whether the three conferred,\" Weir says, \"but I think it forms a very coherent narrative.\" </p> <p>In Weir's piece \"song\" tellingly replaces the \"love\" of Schumann's title. Divas usually vocalise men's verbal and musical fantasies, but here both the act of singing and the spinning-out of tales are equated with women finding their own voices. Angelou's child recalls \"the heavy silk sound of the ancient spirituals\", and the performer is impelled from speech to wordless song. The pleasure of sexuality is celebrated as Morrison's \"young girl\" raunchily extols \"the risk of love... the love-me-till-I'm-dead of love\" with \"just a boy\". In place of Schumann's sentimental obsession with women's dependence on men, the emphasis lies on a continuity of experience passed from mother to daughter. Male, biblical mythologies are commandeered and rewritten. Estes's prepubescent girl hijacks the language of the Magnificat as she longs for the arrival of the breasts, which will make her \"blessed among women\". Toni Morrison's Eve exults in her eating of the fruit of knowledge, glorying in the fact that it has allowed her to replace her childlike Eden with \"wildernesses deeper than any master's call\". </p> <p>The whole work questions and re-evaluates the nature of archetypes, and continues Weir's exploration of spirituality. We Are Shadows, a vast choral piece commissioned while she was composer in association with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, employs a vast spectrum of texts from Emily Dickinson via Taoist tales to graveyard inscriptions, to form a scary, yet lyrical meditation on mortality and human transience. Storm, another work from her Birmingham years, was written for the CBSO Youth Chorus, and drew on Shakespeare's The Tempest. In the course of an astonishing evocation of the play's enchanted universe, Weir gave Prospero's great speech (\"We are such stuff as dreams are made on\") to the trebles to sing in a passage that was at once shocking, beautiful and unforgettable. \"It was a serious, big piece, but people didn't always take it seriously, because it was written for children,\" she says. She is fiercely committed to involving as many people as possible in music-making. \"I write for Jessye Norman - and I take workshops with adult amateurs. It all just fits together,\" she says. </p> <p>I've often found myself spellbound by the sense of magic that flows from Weir's music. But according to her, what ultimately fascinates her is the relationship between music and narrative. \"Everything I do tells a story,\" she says. Her works are filled with tales, and tellers of tales, and her mind ranges with ease through sagas and collections of folk stories, reworking them, refashioning them. \"I love the narrative of a single voice telling a story. Even in abstract music, I think of what happens at any moment in terms of a simple narrative.\" </p> <p>Her stance is acutely personal, the product, one suspects, partly of her background, partly of her experiences when a student. She was born in Cambridge to Scottish parents, grew up on the outskirts of London, began composing in her teens and went back to Cambridge to study. \"I listened to the avant-garde of the times,\" she says, \"but then I found myself having to analyse Boulez.\" The tone of her voice suggests that it was analysis rather than Boulez that didn't agree with her. \"It was then that I started to go back to the simplicity of folk music and folk tales.\" She drew on her Scottish heritage. \"There's a living folk tradition there, which is very much being revived. In England it's not the same.\" What about her influences? \"I can't pick out two or three composers,\" she says. \"When I was young, Stravinsky and Bartok, certainly, but now I'm constantly being influenced by different things. You can even be influenced by composers you don't like.\" </p> <p>The convergence of influences is a reflection of her astonishing openness, while her music transcends the eclecticism of her inspiration. Woman.life.song forges a universality of emotion and experience from the work of three very different writers. The cycle ends in territory far removed from Schumann's bleak memorial pessimism as the heroine contemplates, with quiet resignation, the impermanence of humanity and asks whether the lessons of life will \"serve me as I face the next adventure\". It is, however, the work's opening that is most telling. The child recalls \"the old songs of the spirit\", the sound of which \"made me rich beyond measure\". The words are Angelou's, but they aptly summarise Weir's achievement - for \"the old songs of the spirit\" are what she continues to fashion for a generation that wishes to sing them anew. </p> <p>\u0095 Woman.life.song is performed on Sunday at the Albert Hall, London SW7 (020-7589 8212).</p>",

At one point, our conversation swerves to her passion for Brahms. \"Every time I hear him,\" she says, lost in wonderment, \"I just want to go and compose again.\" Wonderment is a quality that hangs over much of Weir's music - and not least her new work, woman.life.song, which will receive its British premiere at the Proms on Sunday. The piece is a remarkable collaboration between five women, of whom Weir is one. The others are soprano Jessye Norman, the writers Maya Angelou and Toni Morrison, and Clarissa Pinkola Estes, the Jungian psychoanalyst and mythologist, author of the hugely successful Women Who Run with the Wolves. \"It was Jessye Norman's idea,\" says Weir. \"She was asked to commission a piece for Carnegie Hall. She wanted a work that told the story of a woman's life. Perhaps she was thinking of another Frauenliebe und Leben.\" That work, whose title means Woman's Love and Life, is a song cycle by Schumann, which Norman has recorded, as have many great divas. Whether or not comparisons between the two works are intentional, they will inevitably be drawn. Woman.life.song forms a radical counter to Schumann's cycle, which now comes over as one of the more dodgy expos\u00e9s of the heterosexual male mind. The text, by the German Romantic poet Adalbert von Chamisso, presupposes the absolute dependence of women on men. The \"life\" of Schumann's unnamed heroine begins not with birth, but at the moment she sees the man who will give her existence meaning; her fulfilment consists in marriage and in bearing his child; her life is effectively over when he dies, and all she is left with is memory. \"I don't like the ending,\" Weir says. \"I don't like the way it just cuts off. Then the piano comes back with the melody of the first song.\" Woman.life.song is very different. Does Weir consider the work explicitly feminist? \"You'd better ask Jessye that.\" Weir smiles enigmatically. The feminist credentials of the writers involved are impeccable. \"It steps completely aside from the male tradition, certainly,\" says Weir. \"Around the time of the Carnegie Hall premiere in March, four of us went on an intellectual TV chat-show. I remember it was Estes who said, 'When women do a big project like this, it's very rare.' \" It is Estes's words - a rhapsodic stream of consciousness - that form the bulk of the text, though not, perhaps, its kernel. Her loquacity sets her apart from the concision of Morrison and Angelou. \"In retrospect,\" Weir says, \"I realise that much of the dynamic comes from the contrast between Estes and the other two. Angelou very much wrote prose, while Morrison came up with beautifully crafted lyrics. I had to cut some of Estes's text down.\" Norman, it would seem, had decided which writer was to cover which aspect of her heroine's life. \"I don't know whether the three conferred,\" Weir says, \"but I think it forms a very coherent narrative.\" In Weir's piece \"song\" tellingly replaces the \"love\" of Schumann's title. Divas usually vocalise men's verbal and musical fantasies, but here both the act of singing and the spinning-out of tales are equated with women finding their own voices. Angelou's child recalls \"the heavy silk sound of the ancient spirituals\", and the performer is impelled from speech to wordless song. The pleasure of sexuality is celebrated as Morrison's \"young girl\" raunchily extols \"the risk of love... the love-me-till-I'm-dead of love\" with \"just a boy\". In place of Schumann's sentimental obsession with women's dependence on men, the emphasis lies on a continuity of experience passed from mother to daughter. Male, biblical mythologies are commandeered and rewritten. Estes's prepubescent girl hijacks the language of the Magnificat as she longs for the arrival of the breasts, which will make her \"blessed among women\". Toni Morrison's Eve exults in her eating of the fruit of knowledge, glorying in the fact that it has allowed her to replace her childlike Eden with \"wildernesses deeper than any master's call\". The whole work questions and re-evaluates the nature of archetypes, and continues Weir's exploration of spirituality. We Are Shadows, a vast choral piece commissioned while she was composer in association with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, employs a vast spectrum of texts from Emily Dickinson via Taoist tales to graveyard inscriptions, to form a scary, yet lyrical meditation on mortality and human transience. Storm, another work from her Birmingham years, was written for the CBSO Youth Chorus, and drew on Shakespeare's The Tempest. In the course of an astonishing evocation of the play's enchanted universe, Weir gave Prospero's great speech (\"We are such stuff as dreams are made on\") to the trebles to sing in a passage that was at once shocking, beautiful and unforgettable. \"It was a serious, big piece, but people didn't always take it seriously, because it was written for children,\" she says. She is fiercely committed to involving as many people as possible in music-making. \"I write for Jessye Norman - and I take workshops with adult amateurs. It all just fits together,\" she says. I've often found myself spellbound by the sense of magic that flows from Weir's music. But according to her, what ultimately fascinates her is the relationship between music and narrative. \"Everything I do tells a story,\" she says. Her works are filled with tales, and tellers of tales, and her mind ranges with ease through sagas and collections of folk stories, reworking them, refashioning them. \"I love the narrative of a single voice telling a story. Even in abstract music, I think of what happens at any moment in terms of a simple narrative.\" Her stance is acutely personal, the product, one suspects, partly of her background, partly of her experiences when a student. She was born in Cambridge to Scottish parents, grew up on the outskirts of London, began composing in her teens and went back to Cambridge to study. \"I listened to the avant-garde of the times,\" she says, \"but then I found myself having to analyse Boulez.\" The tone of her voice suggests that it was analysis rather than Boulez that didn't agree with her. \"It was then that I started to go back to the simplicity of folk music and folk tales.\" She drew on her Scottish heritage. \"There's a living folk tradition there, which is very much being revived. In England it's not the same.\" What about her influences? \"I can't pick out two or three composers,\" she says. \"When I was young, Stravinsky and Bartok, certainly, but now I'm constantly being influenced by different things. You can even be influenced by composers you don't like.\" The convergence of influences is a reflection of her astonishing openness, while her music transcends the eclecticism of her inspiration. Woman.life.song forges a universality of emotion and experience from the work of three very different writers. The cycle ends in territory far removed from Schumann's bleak memorial pessimism as the heroine contemplates, with quiet resignation, the impermanence of humanity and asks whether the lessons of life will \"serve me as I face the next adventure\". It is, however, the work's opening that is most telling. The child recalls \"the old songs of the spirit\", the sound of which \"made me rich beyond measure\". The words are Angelou's, but they aptly summarise Weir's achievement - for \"the old songs of the spirit\" are what she continues to fashion for a generation that wishes to sing them anew. \u0095 Woman.life.song is performed on Sunday at the Albert Hall, London SW7 (020-7589 8212).",

We were slow to see that the left was re-inventing itself.

      "bodyText": "William Hague last night warned conservatives in all industrial democracies not to let their leftwing opponents \"re-invent\" themselves as the parties of compassion when their policies were anything but compassionate. Speaking in Philadelphia, where his US counterpart, George W Bush, is about to accept the Republican nomination for the White House, the Conservative leader tailored his language to the \"compassionate conservatism\" which has carried the governor of Texas to an 11% to 16% lead over vice-president Al Gore. Although he mentioned neither Tony Blair nor Bill Clinton by name in a speech to the centre right International Democrats Union, Mr Hague's remarks were clearly targeted at the Tories' and Republicans' coming election rivals - and their \"third way\" language whose \"rhetoric didn't match the reality\". As he spoke his chief strategist, Andrew Lansley, attacked New Labour in London, claiming that the government's \"summer of spin\" tactics would cost taxpayers nearly \u00a317m - \"nearly \u00a32m a week to deflect criticism from their utter failure to deliver\". Deploying the same message, Mr Hague struck a loftier note. \"Perhaps because our victory over the old left was so complete, we allowed ourselves to become complacent. We were slow to see that the left was re-inventing itself. They disowned their roots, repackaged themselves and chose new political leaders,\" he told his audience during a 24 hour visit before he starts a brief holiday. \"They made a systematic attempt to occupy the centre ground of politics by imitating our language, adopting our issues and pretending to be parties of the right. Our Republican party hosts know all too well who pioneered this,\" said Mr Hague, who when he visited Texas last year declared himself impressed by governor Bush's record. Although he praised Mr Bush, who is spending this week making sure his rightwing allies do not frighten off moderate Republicans and crossover Democrats, \"making compassion part of the conservative lexicon in the United States\", Mr Hague did not acknowledge his own debt to Ontario Tories in neighbouring Canada, much of whose \"common sense revolution\" he has borrowed. Citing policies as diverse as law and order, welfare reform, defence and taxation, Mr Hague - who plans to shift back towards the centre ground before election day - argued that parties of the right were better at both compassion and fairness in practice. \"The left talks of compassion but often opposes the main things that compassionate politics should be about. This provides our parties, the parties of the centre right, with a historic opportunity,\" he said. Both Tories and Republicans had much to learn from each other - a lesson both parties knew well.",

      "body": "<p>When I first saw the picture, a woman was waving it around on breakfast TV. I was half asleep. I saw the subjects of the picture three or four times removed - through the veil of my tiredness, compounded by a slight hangover; through the TV camera; through the fingernails of the TV presenter, and, finally, through the lens itself. But I had an immediate reaction. The black-and-white image, the bride and groom not looking at the camera, the formal clothes - I disliked it immediately. Then a woman came on with a picture of the Hollywood sign behind her, and she talked about the key points of the Pitt-Aniston wedding. The fireworks. The security. \"Yuck,\" I thought.</p> <p>Then I went out to get the papers. My tabloid had the picture twice - a big one on the front and a smaller one inside. By now I knew more about the wedding. Not that I'd been looking for more; facts were pouring from every outlet. The wedding, for instance, had cost \u00a31m - 10 days' work for Aniston and possibly less for Pitt. Somebody had estimated that a billion hearts had been broken around the world. But the picture was the big thing. Pitt and Aniston had strewn the Malibu shoreline with mirrors to create an anti-paparazzi glare, and filled the sky with barrage balloons to confound photographers in helicopters. Then they'd presented the world with one picture. This was censorship. Worse than the censorship itself, though, was the presumption that went along with it. Again, I thought, \"Yuck.\"</p> <p>I looked at the picture in more detail. It made me uncomfortable. But why? On the surface, unlike most wedding photographs, there was nothing awful about it. It was not, for instance, like Gazza's wedding pictures, full of grinning red-faced people in humorous costumes. Neither was it like pictures from the wedding of David and Victoria Beckham, in which the couple sat on matching thrones. This picture is in black and white. The bride and groom are not looking at the camera. Pitt is looking downwards, roughly at Aniston's chest. Aniston is smiling and looking at Pitt's eyebrows. They look modest, happy. They are actors. They are playing the part of people who are not involved in a ghastly celebrity wedding.</p> <p>Perhaps that's what made me uneasy - the fact that, even though this is a pictorial record of what must have been, in many ways, a nauseating event, it is not in itself nauseating. It is \"sweet\". The fact that it's in black and white is disarming; you don't see the orange tans, the loud, fake-looking green of over-watered Malibu foliage, the matt pastel colours of the ranch-style beach house in the background. On the contrary - they have the temerity to be tasteful. He is wearing a tuxedo with a skinny tie, a sartorial faux pas which makes him look lovable. She has not ironed her hair, or whatever she does to it in Friends. They look wistful. Annoyingly, they have styled themselves not to look vain.</p> <p>But, clearly, they are vain. Having your wedding picture taken in black and white - how vain can you get? It calls to mind an era when stars were stars, when the press was more deferential. It calls to mind an era, in fact, when the press would have covered the entire wedding, from the vows to the smashing of plates - and still printed a picture like this one. It is saying: \"The press love us and hold us in high esteem.\" But it is not a press photograph. It was taken by a specially selected photographer, and cropped to look intimate and cosy. It is saying: \"These are not people who hire minions to place mirrors along the shore!\"</p> <p>I didn't see Joey. That's another thing. Aniston and Pitt - the Pitts, as they are now - censored the TV pictures of guests arriving at the wedding. We saw minibuses careering past, filmed in the style of news footage of prisoners in transit. Ross and Chandler, on camera for fragments of a second, looked like bodyguards. The whole thing had the air of a mafia wedding. There was a 30-strong gospel choir. Aniston didn't even invite her mother. One helicopter picture shows brownshirted guards hanging around outside the hedge. The flowers alone cost $10,000. Maybe this wasn't Joey's style.</p> <p>This - the luxury, the security, the plunder and price of fame - is what the picture is trying to negate. It's trying to negate the barrage balloons, the guards outside the wedding compound talking into their radios, the prison vans. It might as well be a photograph of a politician and his wife. It is spin. Here is a couple who want to pretend they are just like you and me. They know the price of milk. Knowing that we would not like them if we saw them represented by more conventional images, they have given us a more likable version of themselves. And they think they've taken us in!</p> <p>And then I began to wonder. Poor Brad and Jennifer. You can imagine what the other guests might have whispered as they turned up, as they sipped the first glass of champagne. Was Lisa Kudrow's wedding like this? Hardly. Somehow, Pitt and Aniston, who, when taken separately, are normal, run-of-the-mill screen stars, are more than the sum of their parts. Together, they have become a monster. And if you look at this photograph, you can almost hear them saying: \"We are not a monster! Please don't think we are a monster!\"</p> <p>Look more closely. Pitt, who carries his head aloft on screen, is looking down. His hair has been emasculated. There is, of course, no facial hair. The shoulders slope shyly downwards. Aniston, you can see, has been dieting. Look at that chin. The self-denial of the chin. The couple look coy, almost ashamed. Is Pitt's buttonhole in the shape of a \"J\" as a tribute to Aniston? Are they real pearls all over her dress? Are those creatures looking out of the windows in the top corner dogs? Does that mean that dogs were banned from the wedding? Pitt, sweetly, has a wispy fringe; Aniston, sweetly, wears a veil. Millions of people, including me, will pore over this picture for years to come. It is a cynical, exploitative version of good taste. As spin, it's brilliant. The most monstrous thing of all is that it works.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The biggest worry for the Somerset seaside resort of Minehead used to be the storms off the Severn estuary in winter, flooding the town's roads and leaving the ballroom at Butlin's shin-deep in water.</p> <p>Since the sea wall was built, however, the preoccupation of local people is not keeping the sea out, but bringing tourists in. Minehead is a tourist town through and through, with an atmosphere as gentle as the slopes of the Brendon Hills that surround it, and in a good summer its population of 10,500 more than doubles as the visitors flood in.</p> <p>There has not been a good year for a while, however, and Minehead's 12,000 tourist beds are not even close to full. In common with many of other resorts Minehead is struggling to survive.</p> <p>Yesterday in Blackpool, the tourism minister, Janet Anderson, began a week's tour of beach resorts intended to raise awareness of their problems and suggest means of arresting the decline.</p> <p>Seaside tourism is worth \u00a35bn a year, and 26.5m seaside holidays were taken last year, but the figures mask high unemployment in resorts, particularly in winter, poor transport links and ageing populations. Mrs Anderson will recommend more lottery funding be allocated to coastal towns, ask that the English Tourism Council investigates what people want from a beach holiday, and urge resorts to bid for European Union funding - as well using the internet to encourage younger visitors.</p> <p>\"Resorts face a challenge,\" she said. \"They face competition in the UK and from holidays abroad; expectations have risen among tourists as to the service they expect; and the internet has opened up a whole new world to holidaymakers. British resorts have to develop their appeal.\"</p> <p>When she reaches Minehead on Thursday, she will find that many of the steps she recommends have been taken, yet still the town has fewer and fewer visitors. To a degree Minehead has been running to stand still. As well as the sea wall completed in 1997 at a cost of \u00a312m, \u00a390m has been invested over 10 years. Butlin's, the biggest attraction and business (it sleeps 7,000, and employs 1,500) spent \u00a343m on redeveloping its camp.</p> <p>The money had kept Minehead afloat, but, according to Tim King, tourism officer for West Somerset district council, it was a constant challenge to keep people coming back. \"We have to keep up not only with abroad but with domestic competition. We constantly look to upgrade the quality of attractions and the environment here to hold on to trade.\"</p> <p>What success Minehead has had lies in the diversity of its attractions. As well as the funfair at Butlin's, the penny arcades and the ice cream stalls on the sea front, the West Somerset steam railway brings in 95,000 visitors a year. Others come to visit the castle and heritage village at nearby Dunster, as well as to walk on Exmoor.</p> <p>\"Minehead isn't one of those places to come to sit on the beach,\" said Mr King. Until the sea wall was built and tons of sand were imported, there was not much beach to sit on, and the tourist trade had to be imaginative. \"We turned the resort round to face the land and Exmoor. People come here for much more than the coast, and we benefit from that.\"</p> <p>Minehead is however hugely reliant on Butlin's for its economic health. Recent talks between the Rank Group which owns Butlin's, and Bourne Leisure over a possible sale have made Minehead's residents nervous for the future, although neither party has chosen to comment on negotiations.</p> <p>\"Butlin's has been here 38 years,\" said Mr King. \"People come from all over attracted by Butlin's national brand - shopkeepers and the local businesses here have got used to that trade. If the attraction were to disappear, it would have a huge effect.\"</p> <p>More than 500 local people work at Butlin's, more than double the number of unemployed in the town. Some 375 were claiming benefit last month, though in winter three times that are out of work at any one time. Attracting business other than tourism to Minehead is made difficult by its relative isolation; it is 26 miles from the M4 along the two-lane A39, and the case for a new road is, on a national level, weak.</p> <p>But, if yesterday was a guide, Minehead's future is not that bleak. The beach was full of the families the town needed, many of whom said they would happily come back.</p> <p>Julie Mulhall, from Middle Wallop in Gloucestershire, and her son Niall, six, and her two teenage daughters, were at Butlin's for the week. \"It's a very pretty town - just the right size so it never gets too packed, but lively enough to keep the kids interested. And it doesn't seem to have changed a bit since I last came here 18 years ago.\"</p> <p>The Beadsmoore family were in Somerset for a walking holiday, but Minehead made a pleasant change from the Quantocks. \"Its got all the ingredients of a proper seaside resort. We've had fish and chips on the beach, and we've had a lovely day,\" said Richard Beadsmoore.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The biggest worry for the Somerset seaside resort of Minehead used to be the storms off the Severn estuary in winter, flooding the town's roads and leaving the ballroom at Butlin's shin-deep in water. Since the sea wall was built, however, the preoccupation of local people is not keeping the sea out, but bringing tourists in. Minehead is a tourist town through and through, with an atmosphere as gentle as the slopes of the Brendon Hills that surround it, and in a good summer its population of 10,500 more than doubles as the visitors flood in. There has not been a good year for a while, however, and Minehead's 12,000 tourist beds are not even close to full. In common with many of other resorts Minehead is struggling to survive. Yesterday in Blackpool, the tourism minister, Janet Anderson, began a week's tour of beach resorts intended to raise awareness of their problems and suggest means of arresting the decline. Seaside tourism is worth \u00a35bn a year, and 26.5m seaside holidays were taken last year, but the figures mask high unemployment in resorts, particularly in winter, poor transport links and ageing populations. Mrs Anderson will recommend more lottery funding be allocated to coastal towns, ask that the English Tourism Council investigates what people want from a beach holiday, and urge resorts to bid for European Union funding - as well using the internet to encourage younger visitors. \"Resorts face a challenge,\" she said. \"They face competition in the UK and from holidays abroad; expectations have risen among tourists as to the service they expect; and the internet has opened up a whole new world to holidaymakers. British resorts have to develop their appeal.\" When she reaches Minehead on Thursday, she will find that many of the steps she recommends have been taken, yet still the town has fewer and fewer visitors. To a degree Minehead has been running to stand still. As well as the sea wall completed in 1997 at a cost of \u00a312m, \u00a390m has been invested over 10 years. Butlin's, the biggest attraction and business (it sleeps 7,000, and employs 1,500) spent \u00a343m on redeveloping its camp. The money had kept Minehead afloat, but, according to Tim King, tourism officer for West Somerset district council, it was a constant challenge to keep people coming back. \"We have to keep up not only with abroad but with domestic competition. We constantly look to upgrade the quality of attractions and the environment here to hold on to trade.\" What success Minehead has had lies in the diversity of its attractions. As well as the funfair at Butlin's, the penny arcades and the ice cream stalls on the sea front, the West Somerset steam railway brings in 95,000 visitors a year. Others come to visit the castle and heritage village at nearby Dunster, as well as to walk on Exmoor. \"Minehead isn't one of those places to come to sit on the beach,\" said Mr King. Until the sea wall was built and tons of sand were imported, there was not much beach to sit on, and the tourist trade had to be imaginative. \"We turned the resort round to face the land and Exmoor. People come here for much more than the coast, and we benefit from that.\" Minehead is however hugely reliant on Butlin's for its economic health. Recent talks between the Rank Group which owns Butlin's, and Bourne Leisure over a possible sale have made Minehead's residents nervous for the future, although neither party has chosen to comment on negotiations. \"Butlin's has been here 38 years,\" said Mr King. \"People come from all over attracted by Butlin's national brand - shopkeepers and the local businesses here have got used to that trade. If the attraction were to disappear, it would have a huge effect.\" More than 500 local people work at Butlin's, more than double the number of unemployed in the town. Some 375 were claiming benefit last month, though in winter three times that are out of work at any one time. Attracting business other than tourism to Minehead is made difficult by its relative isolation; it is 26 miles from the M4 along the two-lane A39, and the case for a new road is, on a national level, weak. But, if yesterday was a guide, Minehead's future is not that bleak. The beach was full of the families the town needed, many of whom said they would happily come back. Julie Mulhall, from Middle Wallop in Gloucestershire, and her son Niall, six, and her two teenage daughters, were at Butlin's for the week. \"It's a very pretty town - just the right size so it never gets too packed, but lively enough to keep the kids interested. And it doesn't seem to have changed a bit since I last came here 18 years ago.\" The Beadsmoore family were in Somerset for a walking holiday, but Minehead made a pleasant change from the Quantocks. \"Its got all the ingredients of a proper seaside resort. We've had fish and chips on the beach, and we've had a lovely day,\" said Richard Beadsmoore.",

Dead wood is being cleared. But it is going be a long haul.</p> <p>Cleansing these Augean stables is almost the raison d' tre of Romano Prodi's 20-strong team, created after the resignation of Jacques Santer's commission following allegations of mismanagement, fraud and cronyism. Yet the unpopularity of \"Brussels bureaucrats\" is still legendary; last week's Eurobarometer poll showed that only 24% of Britons trust the commission. The union average is an unimpressive 45%. Lovingly nurtured images of \"fat-cat\" eurocrats enjoying tax-free perks, generous salaries and long lunches die hard and have become conflated with directives and rules (which all member states have agreed to).</p> <p>In fact the private sector pays up to 20% more for the top range of fonctionnaire - for example, the multilingual lawyers working in Mario Monti's competition directorate on such mega-issues as the Vodafone-Mannesmann or Scania-Volvo mergers. Commission employees earn twice as much as their counterparts in national governments. But overall, a British diplomat posted to Brussels earns more than a British commission employee of a similar age and level. Long-overdue closure of the infamous Economat food shop, featured in countless lurid stories in London's febrile, Eurosceptic media, was a smart but low-cost gesture to populist perceptions.</p> <p>Yet however unpopular it is, the commission is badly overstretched, as an independent experts' investigation found last year. Some 300 of 1,250 new or redefined jobs are to go to external relations, where Britain's second commissioner, Chris Patten, has pledged to improve the notoriously bad delivery of the EU's \u00a35.7bn aid programme, the world's largest. Other officials are being sent to work on enlargement to eastern Europe; completing the single market; food safety; the environment; and new areas of justice and home affairs like fighting crime and drug-trafficking. More financial managers, lawyers, personnel managers and IT experts are also needed.</p> <p>Normally hostile staff unions are unstinting in their praise of Mr Kinnock and Romano Prodi for standing up to member states which keep asking for more without providing the resources to match, despite their commitment to a more efficient and accountable body. In parallel, the commission has said it will stop farming out management contracts for aid programmes to consultancies in Brussels, a practice used to get around limits on the numbers of official employees.</p> <p>Mr Kinnock, a graduate of the school of hard knocks, sometimes seems to be smiling through gritted teeth. Critics attack him for trying to implement an Anglo-Saxon agenda: his weary re sponse is that reform is about new versus old, not incorruptible and hard-working northern Europeans versus sleazy and indolent southerners. Appointments are supposed to be made on merit, not under an informal national quota system.</p> <p>By and large, this now happens, although the French are annoyed that several key jobs have been given to talented British candidates. Setting strategic priorities is difficult but relatively straightforward: more rigorous yet decentralised financial controls, including a new internal audit service, are probably the most important change implemented so far. The commission's anti-fraud unit has been beefed up under a tough German prosecutor and given greater autonomy. It works closely with national police and customs authorities on scams against the community budget.</p> <p>Staffing and career issues are going to be difficult: recruitment, training and the introduction of such modern management practices as job descriptions, personal objectives and performance- related pay all face suspicion and hurdles. Changes to the internal disciplinary system are especially sensitive. Pension reform is planned to make early retirement easier for fiftysomethings who, through no fault of their own, have not been properly trained or managed during careers with the commission lasting up to 30 years.</p> <p>Mr Kinnock has manoeuvred astutely so far to avoid industrial action among staff. But trouble is widely expected in the autumn over plans to externalise some in-house services. Farming out interpretation, argued one union official, would lead to loss of quality and higher costs. Mr Kinnock's upbeat end-of-term report spoke of the \"swan\" period of his reform programme: \"fairly quiet above the surface, paddling furiously underneath\".</p> <p>Brendan Ryan, vice-president of the Union Syndicale, the largest of the six unions, says \"the commission is not a better place than it was a year ago in terms of regaining confidence and pride in what we do. Staff feel that the political leaders either know where they are going and are not telling us, or even worse, they don't know where they want to go.\"</p> <p>Because he is from ever-sceptical Britain, Mr Kinnock has been accused of having a hidden agenda, of secretly trying to reduce the power of the commission, guardian of the treaty and keeper of the supranational flame.</p> <p>But it was a Frenchman, Jacques Chirac, who recently called for the creation of a secretariat to coordinate the work of a pioneer group of integrationist-minded countries (led of course by France and Germany) and conspicuously failed even to mention the commission.</p> <p>It is a sobering thought that if the EU's civil servants do not clean up their own act, they could face a less sympathetic approach by outsiders who care much less about how they do it.</p> <p><b> The European Commission </b> <br> \u009520,000 staff <br>\u0095 11 official languages <br>\u0095 19 commissioners nominated by the 15 EU members <br>\u0095 makes proposals for new legislation; acts as \"guardian\" of EU treaties<br> \u0095 spends EU budget \u00a355bn <br>\u0095 European parliament can dismiss commissioners <br>\u0095 reform white paper of March 2000 asks for overhaul of management <br>\u0095 changes by 2002</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ian.black@theguardian.com\">ian.black@theguardian.com</a></p>",

In fact the private sector pays up to 20% more for the top range of fonctionnaire - for example, the multilingual lawyers working in Mario Monti's competition directorate on such mega-issues as the Vodafone-Mannesmann or Scania-Volvo mergers. Commission employees earn twice as much as their counterparts in national governments. But overall, a British diplomat posted to Brussels earns more than a British commission employee of a similar age and level. Long-overdue closure of the infamous Economat food shop, featured in countless lurid stories in London's febrile, Eurosceptic media, was a smart but low-cost gesture to populist perceptions. Yet however unpopular it is, the commission is badly overstretched, as an independent experts' investigation found last year. Some 300 of 1,250 new or redefined jobs are to go to external relations, where Britain's second commissioner, Chris Patten, has pledged to improve the notoriously bad delivery of the EU's \u00a35.7bn aid programme, the world's largest. Other officials are being sent to work on enlargement to eastern Europe; completing the single market; food safety; the environment; and new areas of justice and home affairs like fighting crime and drug-trafficking. More financial managers, lawyers, personnel managers and IT experts are also needed. Normally hostile staff unions are unstinting in their praise of Mr Kinnock and Romano Prodi for standing up to member states which keep asking for more without providing the resources to match, despite their commitment to a more efficient and accountable body. In parallel, the commission has said it will stop farming out management contracts for aid programmes to consultancies in Brussels, a practice used to get around limits on the numbers of official employees. Mr Kinnock, a graduate of the school of hard knocks, sometimes seems to be smiling through gritted teeth. Critics attack him for trying to implement an Anglo-Saxon agenda: his weary re sponse is that reform is about new versus old, not incorruptible and hard-working northern Europeans versus sleazy and indolent southerners. Appointments are supposed to be made on merit, not under an informal national quota system. By and large, this now happens, although the French are annoyed that several key jobs have been given to talented British candidates. Setting strategic priorities is difficult but relatively straightforward: more rigorous yet decentralised financial controls, including a new internal audit service, are probably the most important change implemented so far. The commission's anti-fraud unit has been beefed up under a tough German prosecutor and given greater autonomy. It works closely with national police and customs authorities on scams against the community budget. Staffing and career issues are going to be difficult: recruitment, training and the introduction of such modern management practices as job descriptions, personal objectives and performance- related pay all face suspicion and hurdles. Changes to the internal disciplinary system are especially sensitive. Pension reform is planned to make early retirement easier for fiftysomethings who, through no fault of their own, have not been properly trained or managed during careers with the commission lasting up to 30 years. Mr Kinnock has manoeuvred astutely so far to avoid industrial action among staff. But trouble is widely expected in the autumn over plans to externalise some in-house services. Farming out interpretation, argued one union official, would lead to loss of quality and higher costs. Mr Kinnock's upbeat end-of-term report spoke of the \"swan\" period of his reform programme: \"fairly quiet above the surface, paddling furiously underneath\". Brendan Ryan, vice-president of the Union Syndicale, the largest of the six unions, says \"the commission is not a better place than it was a year ago in terms of regaining confidence and pride in what we do. Staff feel that the political leaders either know where they are going and are not telling us, or even worse, they don't know where they want to go.\" Because he is from ever-sceptical Britain, Mr Kinnock has been accused of having a hidden agenda, of secretly trying to reduce the power of the commission, guardian of the treaty and keeper of the supranational flame. But it was a Frenchman, Jacques Chirac, who recently called for the creation of a secretariat to coordinate the work of a pioneer group of integrationist-minded countries (led of course by France and Germany) and conspicuously failed even to mention the commission. It is a sobering thought that if the EU's civil servants do not clean up their own act, they could face a less sympathetic approach by outsiders who care much less about how they do it.

Although Kuwait was liberated in early 1991 and Iraq is a military shadow of its former self, the nature and number of the problems created by the Iraqi dictator's historic blunder have increased. But for an act of God, Saddam will continue to haunt us for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>The coalition created to eject Saddam from Kuwait is no more. Except for the US and Britain, most countries would like to see the sanctions imposed on Iraq lifted. The US and UK insist on a literal application of the sanctions and are open in calling for the replacement of Saddam. Meanwhile, he has refused to cooperate with UN weapons inspectors for more than two years. Before then, their reports insisted that he had not complied with security council resolutions calling for the elimination of his weapons of mass destruction. With efforts to disarm Saddam in limbo, Iraq's exports of oil are determined by the UN under the oil-for-food programme aimed at providing the Iraqi people with adequate supplies of food and medicine.</p> <p>But oil-for-food has not worked. Tens of thousands of Iraqis have died of malnutrition and other maladies. Two programme directors, Denis Halliday and Hans von Sponeck, have resigned in protest against the sanctions. Many humanitarian organisations, individuals and countries have supported the Halliday-Sponeck position. Although they do not absolve Saddam, he has achieved a propaganda victory. The world expects more from functioning democracies than from a thug.</p> <p>Except for the Kurds, Saddam's Iraqi opponents operate outside their country. Neither they, nor the many plots against him by Iraqi army officers, have managed to unbalance Saddam. In fact, he has used the plots and the alliance between his opponents and the US to his advantage. To Saddam, this is an excuse for greater oppression of his people.</p> <p>Internationally, he has driven a wedge between the US and Britain and the rest of the world. This is particularly true of the Arab masses outside Iraq. Because they are not subject to his brutality, they see him as a hero who has successfully stood up to the west. Arab leaders fear their people's reaction and are opening channels of communication with Iraq. Non-Arab countries, including the Russian Federation, China and France, want to readmit Iraq to the international community and trade with it.</p> <p>Saddam has used the determination of the US and Britain to replace him to maintain an extremely efficient security system. Run by his two psychopathic sons and other members of his family, the security apparatus has eliminated thousands of Iraqis. In addition, army officers are rotated on a regular basis, units close to Baghdad have no ammunition, and only three people know Saddam's movements.</p> <p>All Middle East governments prefer Saddam to the prospect of a civil war in Iraq. A violent upheaval in Iraq might spill into their territories or weaken their regional positions. To Saudi Arabia and Turkey, a victory for Iraq's Shia majority would be a victory for Islamic fundamentalist Iran. To Turkey, Iran and Syria, a divided Iraq with a free Kurdistan would incite their Kurds to rebellion. The scenarios are endless and so are the unacceptable dangers they would produce. Saddam comes out first because he is the second choice of all of his neighbours.</p> <p>Even the US and Britain have no solution to what might follow Saddam's departure. Despite the rhetoric, their no-fly zones and frequent bombing of Iraqi facilities and troops, both countries know that only a military invasion of Iraq would guarantee that Saddam is replaced by someone acceptable to them. In reality, this is not an option. The US and Britain do not have the international backing or mandate to invade Iraq; there is nothing in UN resolutions which calls for Saddam's removal; hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to invade and control Iraq; the British and American people are tired of the Iraqi problem and would not support such a costly operation; and the reaction in the Arab and Islamic worlds would be violent.</p> <p>With his neighbours more secure with Saddam in power, and the US and Britain restricted from invading Iraq, the only open option is to leave the job of toppling Saddam to the Iraqis themselves. But they suffer from limitations and divisions which have played into Saddam's hands. The Iraqi opposition is so divided that the US and Britain spend more time trying to unite them than they devote to removing Saddam. Many Iraqi opposition leaders have no following on the ground. Others quarrel among themselves as to who should be leader.</p> <p>On the popular level the prospects for an uprising are all but nonexistent. The Iraqis remember what happened in 1991, when they rebelled in response to western calls and propaganda. They were abandoned to Saddam's troops, who killed tens of thousands of them. In 1995, the Iraqi national congress attacked Saddam's forces from the north of Iraq, which had been liberated by the Kurds as a first step towards a general uprising. The attackers occupied several northern towns and asked for US air support. When the US refused to intervene, the Kurds split into supporters and opponents of the anti-Saddam movement and the rebellion eventually fizzled out.</p> <p>The failure of the 1991 popular uprising, the 1995 military attack and other CIA-sponsored attempts to unseat Saddam leaves the Iraqi army as the one organisation capable of removing him. Conspiring against Saddam means overcoming the huge security apparatus of more than 200,000 full-time civilian and military informers. Run by Saddam's second son Qussay, a 34-year-old who is as capable, calculating and murderous as his father, it is probably the most efficient in the world. It is backed by the Special Republican Guard and the Republican Guard. The officers of these privileged units repay Saddam through total loyalty. Most of them fear what might happen to them should Saddam be toppled, and the opposition, the US and Britain have not made effective direct appeals to them. Instead of repeating Saddam horror stories, promising these special units an amnesty after their leader's departure might induce them to act.</p> <p>Unless they are offered an incentive to change sides, the commitment of the Republican Guard to Saddam eliminates the last hope for a revolution or coup in the traditional mould. But the strength of Saddam's regime is also the source of its weakness.

The law on nature conservation and wildlife protection has been in desperate need of reform, a fact recognised by the government in its manifesto. The introduction of the countryside bill as a means of securing a future for our protected areas and wildlife in England and Wales, despite opposition from land-owning interests in parliament, was welcomed by the 6m members of wildlife groups and the public.</p> <p>The bill is a flagship piece of legislation. It will establish wildlife protection unequalled in most parts of the world and facilitate public enjoyment of our countryside. Its successful passage will be a substantial achieve ment for the government and will help to arrest the alarming decline in Britain's most important wildlife sites. If the government is serious in its claims to be concerned about the environment, then it is vital that it does not waver in its commitment to this bill, the only real green legislation announced in the current parliamentary programme. <br> <b> Les Jones </b> <br> Deputy chief executive, WWF</p> <p>\u0095I was horrified to hear about the Lords' threat to the countryside bill. If this legislation sinks, the public will rightly question whether the government really has put the environment at its heart. This is a dangerous question in the run-up to the election, as the bill is widely popular, particularly so among middle England. Many Labour MPs worked hard to make sure this bill was introduced because we know the level of support in our constituencies. Michael Meacher took elaborate care in the Commons to ensure key opposition concerns were addressed.</p> <p>I hope it will not be necessary, but if John Prescott has to invoke the Parliament Act, then so be it. <br> <b> Helen Brinton MP </b> <br> Chair, PLP environment protection group</p> <p>\u0095It should be remembered that landowners are in direct receipt of over \u00a35bn in public subsidy.

      "bodyText": "The first landmark piece of countryside legislation in 20 years must not be allowed to fall (Countryside bill at risk, July 31). The law on nature conservation and wildlife protection has been in desperate need of reform, a fact recognised by the government in its manifesto. The introduction of the countryside bill as a means of securing a future for our protected areas and wildlife in England and Wales, despite opposition from land-owning interests in parliament, was welcomed by the 6m members of wildlife groups and the public. The bill is a flagship piece of legislation. It will establish wildlife protection unequalled in most parts of the world and facilitate public enjoyment of our countryside. Its successful passage will be a substantial achieve ment for the government and will help to arrest the alarming decline in Britain's most important wildlife sites. If the government is serious in its claims to be concerned about the environment, then it is vital that it does not waver in its commitment to this bill, the only real green legislation announced in the current parliamentary programme. Les Jones Deputy chief executive, WWF \u0095I was horrified to hear about the Lords' threat to the countryside bill. If this legislation sinks, the public will rightly question whether the government really has put the environment at its heart. This is a dangerous question in the run-up to the election, as the bill is widely popular, particularly so among middle England. Many Labour MPs worked hard to make sure this bill was introduced because we know the level of support in our constituencies. Michael Meacher took elaborate care in the Commons to ensure key opposition concerns were addressed. I hope it will not be necessary, but if John Prescott has to invoke the Parliament Act, then so be it. Helen Brinton MP Chair, PLP environment protection group \u0095It should be remembered that landowners are in direct receipt of over \u00a35bn in public subsidy. Is it not high time that these subsidies, which can amount to many hundreds of thousands of pounds per landowner, were made open for all the world to see? Peter Hack Bristol",

      "body": "<p>Dame Anne Mueller, who has died aged 69, was the most successful woman civil servant of her generation, rising to become second permanent secretary in the Cabinet Office, and then at the Treasury. Her brilliant career was the more remarkable for having been achieved in spite of a struggle against serious illness that dogged almost the whole of her working life.</p> <p>Anne was born in Bombay to a German businessman father and English mother who had met and married in India. In the late 1930s, as a result of her father's ill-health, her parents settled in Slovenia, where they ran a vineyard. After the onset of the second world war, Anne's mother joined her daughter in England.</p> <p>The disruption of her family life, and the obvious difficulties for a young girl coming as a stranger with a German name into an English school at that time must have been a considerable source of stress; Anne would occasionally refer to this period in her life, dryly, as \"character-forming\". And it was perhaps at this time that she did indeed develop the somewhat reserved, cool style that she projected, to all except close friends, in her professional life.</p> <p>At Wakefield girls' high School, her prize in a national essay competition was to spend three months in the United States. A scholarship took her to Somerville College, Oxford, where she read philosophy, politics and economics.</p> <p>After graduating, Anne joined the civil service, entering the Ministry of Labour and National Service in 1953. She made her Whitehall career in the departments that specialised in employment, technology and industrial policy, becoming (in the rather quaint Whitehall nomenclature of that time) an undersecretary at the Department of Industry (DoI) in 1972 and then a deputy secretary in 1977. This was a time of great professional success for Anne; during the mid-1970s, the DoI and the Treasury worked closely together on industrial policy, at a time when this was synonymous with large- scale state intervention in industry, and she was in the thick of it.</p> <p>After the change of government in 1979, Anne continued to be very successful, and led the DoI work on regional policy - a very hot and tricky policy area in the recession of the early 1980s. She moved on to the Cabinet Office in 1984, where she was responsible for the personnel management side of the civil service. Her final job in Whitehall, from 1987 to 1990, was as second permanent secretary at the Treasury.</p> <p>This was a formidably successful career, carved out in tough parts of the Whitehall jungle, with big numbers and big reputations at stake. In addition to the qualities of ruthlessness and guile that characterise all successful practitioners of Anne's cho sen profession, she deployed to great effect a quality of steeliness which made her a particularly effective operator. To experience a long, penetrating gaze from Anne, in response to some ill-considered or badly expressed intervention, was a fairly terrifying experience - and one made sure to have one's act together next time.</p> <p>All this, however, was the professional Anne.

      "bodyText": "Dame Anne Mueller, who has died aged 69, was the most successful woman civil servant of her generation, rising to become second permanent secretary in the Cabinet Office, and then at the Treasury. Her brilliant career was the more remarkable for having been achieved in spite of a struggle against serious illness that dogged almost the whole of her working life. Anne was born in Bombay to a German businessman father and English mother who had met and married in India. In the late 1930s, as a result of her father's ill-health, her parents settled in Slovenia, where they ran a vineyard. After the onset of the second world war, Anne's mother joined her daughter in England. The disruption of her family life, and the obvious difficulties for a young girl coming as a stranger with a German name into an English school at that time must have been a considerable source of stress; Anne would occasionally refer to this period in her life, dryly, as \"character-forming\". And it was perhaps at this time that she did indeed develop the somewhat reserved, cool style that she projected, to all except close friends, in her professional life. At Wakefield girls' high School, her prize in a national essay competition was to spend three months in the United States. A scholarship took her to Somerville College, Oxford, where she read philosophy, politics and economics. After graduating, Anne joined the civil service, entering the Ministry of Labour and National Service in 1953. She made her Whitehall career in the departments that specialised in employment, technology and industrial policy, becoming (in the rather quaint Whitehall nomenclature of that time) an undersecretary at the Department of Industry (DoI) in 1972 and then a deputy secretary in 1977. This was a time of great professional success for Anne; during the mid-1970s, the DoI and the Treasury worked closely together on industrial policy, at a time when this was synonymous with large- scale state intervention in industry, and she was in the thick of it. After the change of government in 1979, Anne continued to be very successful, and led the DoI work on regional policy - a very hot and tricky policy area in the recession of the early 1980s. She moved on to the Cabinet Office in 1984, where she was responsible for the personnel management side of the civil service. Her final job in Whitehall, from 1987 to 1990, was as second permanent secretary at the Treasury. This was a formidably successful career, carved out in tough parts of the Whitehall jungle, with big numbers and big reputations at stake. In addition to the qualities of ruthlessness and guile that characterise all successful practitioners of Anne's cho sen profession, she deployed to great effect a quality of steeliness which made her a particularly effective operator. To experience a long, penetrating gaze from Anne, in response to some ill-considered or badly expressed intervention, was a fairly terrifying experience - and one made sure to have one's act together next time. All this, however, was the professional Anne. The private person was another matter. She was, first and fore most, a true and thoughtful friend. I first discovered this, when, as a young civil servant still very much in awe of her, I found her, somewhat to my surprise, among the first of my colleagues to offer me practical and affectionate support at a time of great personal loss. We subsequently became good friends, and I came to know her love of travel, art and music, of pretty clothes - she had a passion for many-buttoned, brightly coloured clothes, which suited her petite frame and made her a striking and elegant figure - and antique jewellery. She loved good food and wine, and entertaining her friends in her big sunny flat perched on the top of Campden Hill, west London. The defining characteristic of the private Anne, however, was her extreme stoicism in the face of a long struggle with increasingly debilitating illness. In 1956, while on secondment to the Organisation of European Economic Co-operation in Paris, she had been involved, as an innocent victim returning from a sightseeing tour of Fontaine- bleau, in a crash which threw her from her car. It seemed at first that she would not survive her multiple injuries, and indeed she was out of action for two years. But as a result of her injuries, she developed severe arthritis at a relatively early age. Then, in her late 50s, she was diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease, which took an increasing toll on her physical mobility throughout her 60s. She coped with great courage and dignity with the consequent problems - while pursuing a very active and varied post-Whitehall career. She devoted a great deal of her time to higher education, in which she was passionately interested, becoming chancellor of De Montfort University in Leicester from 1991 to 1995.

But he admitted that many of Gordon Brown's huge investment programmes for health, education and transport still have far to go. \"We have to show people that the first results are there, some of the flowers and shoots of delivery. It's daffodil time, but the full chorus of summer will have to come with the capital investment,\" said Mr Prescott, whose newly unveiled transport plan is set to generate \u00a3180bn of public and private investment - over 10 years.</p> <p>\"It's all long term,\" he emphasised in an interview with the Guardian before he takes over minding the Downing Street shop when the Blairs go on holiday next weekend.</p> <p><b> Election</b><br></p> <p>Mr Prescott is himself on holiday in Cyprus this week, amid new allegations that nearly \u00a3100,000 was spent unnecessarily on his official flat in Admiralty House, Whitehall. Political allies sprang to his defence, insisting that the flat had been stripped by officials in an inter-departmental turf war before he moved in in 1997. In his Guardian interview the deputy prime minister predicted that voters who had joined the Labour party for the first time in 1997 - then \"did not renew their subscriptions\" - would come flooding back once they faced the \"excitement\" of another election campaign against a Hague-led Conservative party.</p> <p>\"It's about getting the party back in the mood for an election,\" said Mr Prescott. \"Many in our party still believe that with such a big majority it's a walkover. We have got to tell them it's not, we have got to tell them that what we are fighting for is to win a big enough majority to take us into a third term.\"</p> <p>Neither ministers nor officials will say what that means for saving as much as possible of Blair's 179-seat majority in 1997, though recent fears that it will dip well below 100 seats were offset by the latest Times/Mori poll which put Labour on 49% to the Tories' 33%, compared with a 43% to 33% split in 1997. But Mr Prescott, who revealed that Labour will run two campaigns on key issues this summer - on health and on rural policies, admitted that the election strategy team he is now rejoining will concentrate on 140-150 key seats, including 100 with significant rural elements. \"The difference for Labour is that in most of these seats there are now Labour MPs, not candidates. It makes a significant difference to getting our message across.\"</p> <p>Now 62 and the MP for Hull East for 30 years, Mr Prescott remembers with despair Labour's problems in the 1970s. \"They spent the money to begin with, then ended up dealing with the economic cycle, one thing or another, and they had to cut back.\" He was clearly delighted that it has not happened again this time. In his end of term survey of the government's achievements, the deputy prime minister made light of the bad publicity Labour received over leaked memos from pollster Philip Gould - of whom he has sharply remarked that \"all that glitters is not Gould\". Voters are more interested in delivery of better public services than leaks, he insists. \"Memos here, memos there, seem to excite more attention than a \u00a31bn here and a \u00a31bn there. I don't think memos make a great deal of difference to the electorate, frankly. At the end of the day they'll judge us on whether we deliver and we must keep our eye on that,\" he said, politely, but with visible disdain.</p> <p>But the man who runs the vast Whitehall empire at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions was on message enough to admit that Tony Blair's cautious chancellor turned out to be \"absolutely right\" to stick to the Tory public spending plans he inherited in 1997 for two years. Instead of the hours which the Wilson and Callaghan cabinets spent quarrelling into the small hours over spending cuts - \"who's going to cut what and where, they were all about cuts, cuts, cuts at one o'clock in the morning\" - he was now sitting in a Labour cabinet which had achieve a virtuous circle. \"After three years and some difficult stages we're asking, 'How many billions do we spend?'</p> <p>Sitting in his ministerial office at Westminster, close to Blair's below Big Ben, Mr Prescott hammered home the justification for his own timetable as well as Gordon Brown's: he had to get his transport plans in order, then get the necessary legislation, then get the money.</p> <p><b> Pain</b><br></p> <p>\"I had to take some of the pain for it [Brown's caution] because I knew I was one of those who was going to have cutbacks in some of my programmes because they were going to be capital programmes which are slower to get moving and only now showing results in terms of new trains, buses, road and rail improvements,\" he conceded.</p> <p>Mr Prescott saved some of his harshest criticisms for environmentalists - especially \"bloody moaners\" like Friends of the Earth - who ignored the extent to which Labour has met their demands (\"I have probably come in with more ideas and done more about the environment than any other secretary of state\"), but run away from political battles when the going gets rough with the Tory tabloids. \"When petrol prices went up where were they?

Blow me, they must have gone to Mars, gone in a solar-powered space ship.\"</p> <p>He realised that campaigning groups \"need to have an enemy\" if they were to recruit new supporters. \"My point is that Friends of the Earth were sadly missing when the big war started over petrol prices. They let the politicians fight it out.\"</p> <p>What evidently infuriated him was the gap between theory and practical politics. Some environmental groups were excellent, he conceded.

It has been devel oped by the Jerwood Foundation in association with English Heritage, the owners of Witley Court.</p> <p>The pieces have been loaned by the Frink estate and transported from Dorset, where the sculptor spent her last years.</p> <p>Her son Lin Jammet said: \"This place is so monumental and the pieces look slightly dwarfed when compared with how they look at home,\" he said. \"But my mother's sculpture is designed to fit wherever it is best seen and a lot of it has a funny way of fitting in with any environment.

He is resting on his knees and appears calm. But 200 yards away past a fountain, a barrel-chested colleague scratches his head as if disturbed by the randomness of fate. Seated Man (1986) and First Man (1964) have gone on show with six other works by Elisabeth Frink (1930-93) at Witley Court in Worcestershire, the former home of the earls of Dudley and now the home of the Jerwood sculpture park which was officially opened yesterday. It has been devel oped by the Jerwood Foundation in association with English Heritage, the owners of Witley Court. The pieces have been loaned by the Frink estate and transported from Dorset, where the sculptor spent her last years. Her son Lin Jammet said: \"This place is so monumental and the pieces look slightly dwarfed when compared with how they look at home,\" he said. \"But my mother's sculpture is designed to fit wherever it is best seen and a lot of it has a funny way of fitting in with any environment. Her sculpture is accessible anywhere.\" Alan Grieve, the chairman of the foundation, said: \"We have had the Jerwood painting prize since 1994. But we had done nothing for sculpture.\" English Heritage suggested Witley Court and the foundation moved in seven works by Antony Gormley, Michael Ayrton and others to begin a permanent collection now complemented by temporary exhibitions of which the Frink show is the first. \"It's a wonderful site,\" added Mr Grieve. \"It takes two or three years to make an impression.

In the meantime, they said, prosecutors would be wise not to go ahead with further prosecutions.</p> <p>Ben Emmerson QC, who represented ADT in Strasbourg, said: \"The outcome of this case was never seriously in doubt. In singling out gay men, the offence bears the hallmarks of homophobic prejudice, and belongs to the less tolerant era. This judgment simply confirms a principle which most people take for granted, namely that harmless sexual activity between consenting adults, which takes place behind closed doors and away from public view, is none of the state's business.\"</p> <p>ADT was arrested after police raided his home and seized videos showing him and up to four other men engaging in oral sex. He was prosecuted, convicted of gross indecency and given a two-year conditional discharge in November 1996.</p> <p>The Strasbourg judges ruled that the prosecution had breached his right to privacy under article 8 of the human rights convention, and ordered the government to pay him \u00a320,929.05 damages and \u00a312,391.83 costs.</p> <p>The gay rights group Stonewall said the ruling \"drives a coach and horses\" through the gross indecency laws. Angela Mason, its executive director, said: \"I believe the government will now have to issue a directive to police officers telling them not to continue prosecutions under this offence.\"</p> <p>A Home Office spokeswoman said the judgment would be taken into account in formulating a new sexual offences law. \"In our observations to the court the UK government made it clear that this area of the law is already under review.\"</p> <p>Adrian Rogers, adviser to the pro-family pressure group Family Focus, said the ruling highlighted the need for Britain to distance itself from Europe, which is \"bringing down the social fabric of our society\".</p> <p>He added: \"One wonders whether anything is going to remain illegal in Europe.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Simon Hughes, said: \"It is obvious for a long time that we still have some discriminatory laws relating to the sexual actions of consenting adults in private.</p> <p>\"Clearly the law will have to be changed.

The unanimous ruling means the government will have to axe provisions in the Sexual Offences Act 1956 which make group sex in private an offence for gay men but not for heterosexuals or lesbians. The case, brought by a 52-year-old Yorkshireman named only by the initials ADT, was one of the main catalysts behind the Home Office's sex offences review, set up to identify offences likely to fall foul of the forthcoming Human Rights Act. The review, published last week, recommended the abolition of the gross indecency law under which ADT was convicted. \"Consensual sexual activity between adults in private that causes no harm should not be criminal,\" said the review report. Lawyers said the ruling opened the way for men convicted in similar circumstances to apply to have their convictions overturned after October 2000, when the human rights act comes into force. In the meantime, they said, prosecutors would be wise not to go ahead with further prosecutions. Ben Emmerson QC, who represented ADT in Strasbourg, said: \"The outcome of this case was never seriously in doubt. In singling out gay men, the offence bears the hallmarks of homophobic prejudice, and belongs to the less tolerant era. This judgment simply confirms a principle which most people take for granted, namely that harmless sexual activity between consenting adults, which takes place behind closed doors and away from public view, is none of the state's business.\" ADT was arrested after police raided his home and seized videos showing him and up to four other men engaging in oral sex. He was prosecuted, convicted of gross indecency and given a two-year conditional discharge in November 1996. The Strasbourg judges ruled that the prosecution had breached his right to privacy under article 8 of the human rights convention, and ordered the government to pay him \u00a320,929.05 damages and \u00a312,391.83 costs. The gay rights group Stonewall said the ruling \"drives a coach and horses\" through the gross indecency laws. Angela Mason, its executive director, said: \"I believe the government will now have to issue a directive to police officers telling them not to continue prosecutions under this offence.\" A Home Office spokeswoman said the judgment would be taken into account in formulating a new sexual offences law. \"In our observations to the court the UK government made it clear that this area of the law is already under review.\" Adrian Rogers, adviser to the pro-family pressure group Family Focus, said the ruling highlighted the need for Britain to distance itself from Europe, which is \"bringing down the social fabric of our society\". He added: \"One wonders whether anything is going to remain illegal in Europe.\" The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Simon Hughes, said: \"It is obvious for a long time that we still have some discriminatory laws relating to the sexual actions of consenting adults in private. \"Clearly the law will have to be changed. We shall be seeking assurances from the government before parliament returns that where the law is in breach of the convention we should change the law at the earliest possible opportunity.\" Useful links European Court of Human Rights judgment Sexual offences (amendment) bill",

Or had any correspondence at all, for that matter. </p> <p>When Kingsley Amis and Philip Larkin began their exchanges, the letter was the standard form of communication; the telephone was in its infancy and even as recently as the 1970s many older people were slightly wary of using it for anything more than making arrangements or business matters.</p> <p>These days, though, the telephone has become the universal medium and to find a personal letter - other than at birthdays and Christmas - in one's mail is something of a rarity. Just about the only letter writers on the increase, it seems, are the financial services that send out endless invitations for new credit cards. </p> <p>Merlin Holland regrets the passing of the letter and feels that the genre has been on the decline ever since the advent of the typewriter. \"Looking at Oscar Wilde's letters, you can see how much his mood affected his handwriting,\" he says. \"Particularly towards the end of his life, his writing degenerates into a scrawl. At one point he even says that, 'My writing has gone to bits, like my character'. The typewriter conceals these nuances. Moreover, it also allows you to correct mistakes and therefore tends to encourage a looser style. </p> <p>Handwritten letters need to be a great deal more considered to avoid loads of crossings-out.\" </p> <p>Where the letter is on the way out, though, the email is very much on the way in, and many academics and curators believe that electronic data will dominate the literary archives in the future. \"Authors are becoming aware of the value of emails as a source of potential correspondence,\" says Dr Chris Fletcher, curator of modern literary manuscripts at the British Library. </p> <p>\"The problem for curators is who to collect and how to collate their work. It is becoming increasingly difficult to retrieve material off some of the early software, such as Amstrad, and some servers automatically delete old emails when they become too full. Ideally, authors should print out a hard copy of their emails to ensure their preservation.\"</p> <p>Dr Fletcher's point is well made, but more recent emails should present no problems at all for the archivist, though they may for their authors. Bill Clinton and Al Gore are just two among many who have found to their cost that there's no such thing as a deleted email these days. </p> <p>Email is, of course, a completely different animal to the letter. It tends to be much less formal and much shorter than snail mail; as such, it usually makes for much less edifying reading. One can guess that the spat between Martin Amis and Julian Barnes would have been reduced to a childish, \"It was your fault, you bastard\"; \"No it wasn't, it was yours\" on email, while the insults would have been rather more erudite and entertaining had they been on paper. </p> <p>Even so, Dr Fletcher goes on to point out that emails have their benefits. \"Very few authors ever bothered to make a carbon copy of the letters they sent out,\" he says, \"so tracking down their correspondence became a matter of detective work.\" (Some letters are just lost for ever. No letters that Kingsley Amis sent to his parents during the Blitz survive, and all his letters to his first wife, Hilly, were burnt when they separated in 1963). \"Email automatically stores a copy of the message in the sent letter cache, so it could be possible to maintain a complete record. Similarly, because of email's reply function it is now possible to keep a complete record of both people's messages on the same document.\" </p> <p>John Sutherland, Lord Northcliffe Professor of Modern English at University College London, recently asked Tom Staley, keeper of manuscripts at the Harry Ransom Center in Texas, one of the world's largest literary archives, whether he was collecting hard disks from authors. The reply was, \"Goddammit no, we've got too much already,\" but Sutherland reckons it's only a matter of time before a writer sells his or her hard disk to a library. Or has it buried with them. </p> <p>Some libraries, though, are actively hunting out the papers of contemporary authors. Zachary Leader, the editor of the Kingsley Amis letters, was recently asked to host a seminar on modern British novelists at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. \"In the course of the seminar,\" he says, \"the library seems to have persuaded at least one participant to part with her literary papers.\" </p> <p>Authors who come to a deal with the library are obliged to hand over all electronic and hard-copy material in exchange for an agreed fee. The sums involved can be substantial. For instance, in 1987 Kingsley Amis received $90,000 for 483 catalogued items and Leader believes that modern authors have little idea of the value of their material. \"When I was researching the Amis letters, Martin's wife talked of finding crumpled-up letters from Saul Bellow amongst his possessions. I might add that he takes much more care of them now.\" </p> <p>The prospect of a bunch of authors suddenly catching on to the idea that they are sitting on a potential goldmine is intriguing, not least as it opens the way for two authors to commence a correspondence with one another purely to create a saleable product rather than to exchange ideas or gossip.

When the first collection of Oscar Wilde letters, edited by Rupert Hart-Davis, was published in 1960, it led to a complete re-evaluation of Wilde's life and work. Where Wilde was originally seen as something of a lightweight comedian, the letters revealed a depth and learning that had never hitherto been imagined. </p> <p>The number of PhD theses on Wilde soared as a result.

Could specialist semioticians have picked their way though the new e-language to uncover the real people hiding underneath? Just possibly. But why leave things to chance?

Not bad for a 12-week summer job and enough for him to jet off to Cape Town later this year to finish his first novel. </p> <p>\"Halfway through my second term at Oxford I realised that I was not particularly employable,\" says Dougald, 22, at the end of a 12-hour day stomping the streets of south-west London. </p> <p>\"I had spent my Easter vacation trying to find work, and failing. I got this flier in my pigeon hole saying this would be 'the most challenging thing you could do this summer'.\" </p> <p>Dougald joined other Oxford undergraduates at a presentation last summer, then went through a lengthy selection process, finally spending a week on a training programme with other students. </p> <p>They are then given a business account free of charge by Barclays. Southwestern allocates them an area, sells them the books at cost, and the students basically set about running their own business. </p> <p>How much profit they make is down to their determination to knock on as many doors as possible - and their technique. The key is not to linger where you are not wanted but to find those homes that are happy to welcome you in. </p> <p>\"From my point of view, in 20 seconds I can communicate to somebody that I am not what they would expect from a door-to-door salesperson,\" says Dougald, a former pupil at Hummersknott comprehensive in Darlington, and a sixth-form scholarship pupil at the independent Barnard Castle school. </p> <p>While the company's success may owe something to parental paranoia over school tests, homework requirements and pre-school education, it is largely due to the drive and motivation which Southwestern instils into its prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. </p> <p>This, in turn, has a rather neat spin-off. Such are the life skills deemed to be gained from a summer with Southwestern that Britain's top blue-chip companies actually pay a fee to the company to be introduced to some of its summer salespeople. </p> <p>\"Our goal is to help university students develop skills to help them achieve their goals in life,\" says Duncan Battishill, district sales manager for Southwestern. \"They learn how to set goals, how to organise their time, how to motivate themselves day in, day out and how to overcome rejection.\" </p> <p>And the unsuspecting parents? What is in it for them - apart from parting with anything between \u00a310 and upwards of \u00a3100 on hefty manuals that promise to deal with every niggling homework question? </p> <p>\"Irrespective of the economic climate or the government of the day, most parents want their children to do well,\" says Duncan. \"These books are world-class, with contributing authors from top universities and the children's products tie in very closely with the national curriculum key stages.\" </p> <p>Kingfisher, the children's book publisher, now sells some of its books solely through Southwestern, and has found it sells more copies that way. Unlike venturing into a bookshop, perhaps with impatient toddler in tow, parents are able to browse in their own living room before making their mind up whether they will buy. </p> <p>\"We get these books in front of thousands of prospective buyers every week, whereas people do not walk into bookshops as readily,\" says Duncan. </p> <p>If a family agrees to buy, the salesperson returns and spends time showing the family how to get the most out of the books. </p> <p>Last year, Southwestern sold 5,000 sets of its Learning Adventure Library for younger children and 4,500 copies of its 3,500 page Volume Library for older children. This year they are on course to sell even more. </p> <p>If all this sounds rather new for British shores, Southwestern has a historic place in the US. The company dates back to 1855 when a Reverend J. Jenkins provided work for the working classes in Nashville, Tennessee selling Bibles door-to-door to enable them to further their education. </p> <p>The company, which now deals purely with educational books, employs 3,200 students every summer in the US and Europe. Although the UK operation only started in 1994, about 300 British students - out of 3,000 applicants - have been going to the US as salespeople since the early eighties. </p> <p>\"Employers like this programme because on your application form you can say that you have relocated, set up your own headquarters, run your own business, developed sales and presentation skills and generated X thousand pounds worth of business,\" says Dougald. </p> <p>\"No one does this job because they want to be a door-to-door salesman, but because of the other things you learn from it. You have got to have a real reason why you want to do it; wanting to earn a lot of money is not a good reason. You have got to get a real kick out of the challenge.\" </p> <p>During his final year, Dougald spent two days a month attending Southwestern's management and sales training courses to become a student manager in charge of recruiting for his area this summer. </p> <p>He even thinks he owes his first-class degree to the rigour of his summer sales work. \"I don't know if I would have got myself together had it not been for this job, which made me develop the ability to focus and knuckle down. </p> <p>\"It gives you confidence based on a realistic notion of having really tested yourself rather than confidence based on an estimation of your potential.\"</p>",
