      "bodyText": "Uefa was last night preparing a package of disciplinary measures aimed at making an example of Portugal after some of the worst scenes of player dissent ever seen at an international tournament. European football's governing body launched a top-level inquiry into the tumultuous reaction of Portugal's players before and after Zinedine Zidane's golden-goal penalty winner for France in Wednesday's semi-final at the King Baudouin stadium in Brussels. The referee G\u00fcnter Benk\u00f6 was jostled by Portugal's players and coaches, chased off the pitch, spat at and had a plastic bottle thrown at him after awarding what was, by any standard, a legitimate spot kick on the advice of his Slovakian assistant Igor Sramka. In the subsequent melee Nuno Gomes was sent off for shoving Benk\u00f6 and several others could have followed, with Paulo Bento shaping as if to butt the Austrian and Joao Pinto throwing his shirt at him. Although television pictures showed clearly that Abel Xavier had handled Sylvain Wiltord's goalbound shot, Sramka was also jostled and abused by the Portuguese players, coaches and other members of their backroom staff. The fourth official, Scotland's Hugh Dallas, had to help him leave the pitch as several players tried to mob him. The trouble is believed to have continued into the tunnel, with players storming the door of the referee's room and shouting abuse at him. After a relatively controversy-free tournament, Uefa was so appalled by the scenes that its control and disciplinary committee held a specially convened meeting yesterday. Preliminary statements have been taken from all the officials and the governing body is now awaiting Benk\u00f6's official match report before announcing its decision on disciplinary measures on Sunday. The Portuguese Football Federation is certain to be heavily fined, although the fact it is hosting the 2004 championship rules out any possibility of Portugal being thrown out of the competition. But if the noises emanating from Uefa yesterday indicate that it means to treat the situation with the utmost gravity, Gomes and at least three or four colleagues can expect a lengthy international ban. It is also likely Uefa will review allegations by several Portuguese players that they were the victims of a conspiracy. \"It's incredible to lose a semi-final to a penalty given by the assistant referee,\" their goalkeeper Vitor Baia said yesterday. \"Now I understand better the words of the Uefa secretary-general when he said that he wants a final between France and Holland.\"",

The quality may not quite have clicked but they have got other things in their locker. </p> <p>Even if games become a scrap it is never easy to imagine France being bashed out of their stride. Marcel Desailly, Lilian Thuram and Patrick Vieira epitomise the power of the team and they have a useful habit of grinding out results. I believe the first-choice back four of Thuram, Desailly, Laurent Blanc and Bixente Lizarazu has not lost together in 25 competitive matches. Some of that will come down to mental toughness, which the French have in abundance. </p> <p>That much was obvious even in the warm-up on Wednesday when Didier Deschamps and Blanc were very prominent. They seemed to be laying down the law. </p> <p>Deschamps has had plenty of criticism at Chelsea and in his homeland. I'm not sure he was needed at Stamford Bridge with Dennis Wise, and a lot of people in France feel he's no longer worth his place in the national side. But the longer the semi-final went on, the more influential he became. He sets an example, brings those around him on and helps the team keep their shape. </p> <p>The obvious advantage this France team have over the 1998 side is the quality of their strikers. But to get the best out of them on Sunday I think Roger Lemerre needs to make a change and start with Robert Pires, who added an extra dimension when he came on against Portugal. </p> <p>France played most of Wednesday's match with three midfielders - Vieira, Deschamps and Emmanuel Petit - who do not gallop into the box off the ball or get down the flanks. That meant they suffered a real lack of width, particularly because the full-backs could not get forward much. Lizarazu had his hands full with Sergio Conceicao and I got the impression Portugal had sacrificed Luis Figo for the team cause to block Thuram. </p> <p>What that meant was that when one of France's strikers raided down the flanks and wanted to pull the ball back into the danger zone there was often only one team-mate to aim for. Even Zinedine Zidane rarely gets himself into the area without the ball. </p> <p>A classic example of the problem came late in the match when Thierry Henry got down the left, was desperate to pull the ball back but lacked support and was squeezed out. France need a midfield player to join them up. </p> <p>Vieira has the energy and ability, but if they use Pires in the wide areas the two strikers could stay in the box. For me, Petit, who has been struggling with injury, should make way. This is one of the reasons I would have had David Ginola in the squad, if only as a substitute. </p> <p>The shame is that France have not shown as many moments of quality as we expected. Portugal made it difficult by putting the emphasis on a solid midfield and defence, with the defensive midfielders, Jose Vidigal and Costinha, very effective at times. But no one has lit up this French side. </p> <p>Lizarazu has been the most consistent and there have been moments of brilliance from Zidane, but there have been a lot of French seven out of 10s. Maybe they have decided to be solid, confident someone will do something for them. Perhaps they have a massive performance in them for the final. </p> <p>On Wednesday night they were indebted to Fabien Barthez for a great save from Abel Xavier's header and I'm sure Manchester United fans are looking forward to seeing him next season. He's a bubbly character. </p> <p>He exudes confidence and his kicking is immense but he doesn't look much bigger than Deschamps. I wonder whether a taller keeper might have got closer to Nuno Gomes' goal. He might have the charismatic aura of Peter Schmeichel but not the physical presence. </p> <p>If there is another potential worry it is that he sometimes looks like a graduate from the Bruce Grobbelaar school of goalkeeping, making erratic decisions and chasing the ball to all points of the globe. But his reactions are great and he is lively and decisive. </p> <p>Given that I rate Mark Bosnich as the best goalkeeper I've worked with, I'm biased on who should be No1 at Old Trafford. Barthez's kicking is an advantage but otherwise I think Bossie is the better keeper. Being in and out of the side knocked him last season. He'll make it hard for Barthez early on but ultimately I think he will have to move.</p>",

But those expecting his performance of the C Minor Sonata, K457, to evince only those qualities would have been disappointed. Brendel's tempi in the outer movements bordered on the wild. He launched into the opening arpeggios with white-hot energy. But for all this extraordinary velocity, Brendel reined in the expressivity of his playing, especially in the first movement. This sonata is sometimes played as a prototype for Beethoven's famous C minor pieces, but here, Brendel contained Mozart within strict, classical limits of dynamics and articulation. He was even willing to forego absolute clarity in favour of the overall sweep of the movement. </p> <p>The method behind Brendel's approach was revealed in the central slow movement. Here, every phrase was lovingly nurtured. Where in the first movement the emphasis had been on the large-scale, in the second, Brendel focused on the finesse of each note of Mozart's lavish ornamentation. He savoured the florid appearances of the main theme. Brendel created a greater range of colours and timbres, allowing the instrument to blossom in the meltingly simple melody that appears halfway through the piece. The final allegro returned to the blustery, C minor world of the opening movement. </p> <p>There were more surprises in Haydn's E Flat Major Sonata. Brendel is peerless in communicating the subtle games Haydn plays with his listeners and performers. With minute changes of emphasis and tempo, Brendel led us through the richnesses of Haydn's musical imagination with complete assurance. Mozart's Adagio, K540, was startling for other reasons. Brendel revealed a disturbing obsessiveness in this self-contained slow movement, and hinted at an archaic and private soundworld, altogether removed even from the intimacies of the C Minor Sonata. </p> <p>Schubert's A Minor Sonata, D845, closed the programme, in a performance that created an unstoppable and ever-changing musical momentum.

Subs: Abbiati, Antonioli, Ferrara, Negro, Di Livio, Pessotto, Ambrosini, Montella, Totti, Delvecchio. </p> <p><strong>Holland:</strong> van der Sar, Bosvelt, Stam, F. de Boer, Zenden, Overmars, Davids, van Bronckhorst, Cocu, Bergkamp, Kluivert. Subs: de Goey, Westerveld, Reiziger, Seedorf, Konterman, van Vossen, R. de Boer, van Hooijdonk, Winter. </p> <p>Referee: M Merk (Germany) </p> <p><strong>1 minute</strong> Less than a minute in and we already have the first off-side of the match. But - shock horor - it's not Inzaghi, but his strike partner Del Piero.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> The first chance. Bergkamp spins off his marker, clips a delicate ball over the top, but Cocu's nifty toe-end goes over Toldo - and the bar. </p> <p><strong>6</strong> Inzaghi falls over after a bit of a challenge - he goes off on a stretcher but is soon back on. Now there's a surprise.</p> <p><strong>8</strong> Davids stands over the ball for a while, looking fierce.</p> <p><strong>10</strong> It's all a bit scrappy at the moment - the Italians seem quite happy.</p> <p><strong>12</strong> Van Bronckhorst crosses from the right and Bergkamp gets his head on to the ball. Sadly for the massed ranks of Oranje, he just uses his forehead to pad it back flabbily to Toldo.</p> <p><strong>14</strong> Italy can't get the ball at all. The Dutch pass it around in the Italian half, Zenden has a shot, they get it back and pass it around a bit more. Suddenly, Bergkamp cuts inside from the right and is clear in the box - he smashes a left-foot shot past the advancing Toldo and full onto the face of the left-hand post.</p> <p><strong>16</strong> The first yellow card - Zambrotta is booked for hacking down Zenden.</p> <p><strong>19</strong> Juilano is boooked for cynically tripping up a speeding Overmars. Is the ghost of Gentile returning to the Italian team?</p> <p><strong>21</strong> Dutch have had 70 per cent of the possession, but the Italian's are just hanging back and saying \"Bring it on!\" They nearly pay the penalty when van Bronckhorst's cross is met by Kluivert 15 yards out. However he can only loop it into Toldo's loving hands.</p> <p><strong>24</strong> The Dutch win yet another corner. But yet again it comes to nothing - it's well taken by the dominant looking Toldo. </p> <p><strong>26</strong> Overmars wins another free-kick after Maldini brings him down. The ball's whipped in but it glances off Stam's globe and wide.</p> <p><strong>28</strong> The ball enters the Dutch penalty area for the first time in about 20 minutes. The Italians make nothing of it.</p> <p><strong>29</strong> The astute Bergkamp takes a quick free-kick to release Zenden. He goes down in the box. Penalty? Don't be silly - not with a dive like that. Zenden is rightly booked. </p> <p><strong>31</strong> Zenden is bundled down out wide and the Dutch win yet another free kick in a dangerous position. But once again it lands on an Italian head and is cleared. What's the Dutch for David Beckham? </p> <p><strong>33</strong> <strong>SENDING OFF!</strong> Zambrotta makes a silly challenge - tripping Zenden again - and gets his second yellow. He holds his hands up in mock innocence but the referee's having none of it. \"Off you go!\" he says, manfully.</p> <p><strong>36</strong> Italy seem to have gone even more defensive if that's possible.</p> <p><strong>37</strong> <strong>PENALTY TO HOLLAND</strong>. Overmars turns past Maldini and plays it in the box. It zips around a bit then Nesta tugs Kluivert's shirt. Penalty! Toldo is booked in the verbal exchanges afterwards. Frank De Boer runs up to take it...</p> <p><strong>38</strong> <strong>AND IT'S SAVED</strong>. Toldo leaps to his left and makes a brilliant save, right out of the top draw, Ron. Brilliant.</p> <p><strong>41</strong> Italy get a free kick. The ball enters the Dutch box, and stays in there for about two seconds. Then it's cleared, but at least it's first time the Italians have made any sort of attacking effort in about 15 minutes.</p> <p><strong>43</strong> Kluivert makes a decent contact from a cross but the increasingly calm Toldo plucks it out of the air like a Harlem Globetrotter. Smooth. </p> <p><strong>45</strong> The ball comes to Kluivert 20 yards out and he juggles it - not once, not twice, but three times on his knee - and enters the area. What skill, what verve, what imagination!! Then he shins it wide...</p> <p><strong>First half injury time</strong> Yellow card! This time Maldini is booked. </p> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Italy 0 - 0 Holland</strong> Can anyone remember the last time the Italians were this negative? Surely it's just a matter of time before Dutch do them... </p> <p><strong>46</strong> Zoff hasn't made any changes at half-time. Italy are still playing 4-4-1, with Del Piero playing right-wing. How long before will he resist the temptation to change things. I give it 10 minutes...</p> <p><strong>47</strong> Italy have a shot on target! No really. Well sort of...Fiore fires one in from 20 yards, it deflects off Stam and it's clearly going wide. But Van Der Sar punches it out for a corner anyway. </p> <p><strong>49</strong> Yellow card! Davids brings down Albertini 25 yards out. It's central and Del Piero is eyeing it the same way the Big Bad wolf eyed Little Red Riding Hood...</p> <p><strong>50</strong> But.his lame shot strikes the wall and goes over the bar. Italy can't make anything with resulting the corner.</p> <p><strong>54</strong> Holland have started sloppily this half, and Italy are actually attacking more with 11 men than ten. Inzaghi is fouled by Stam on corner of the box. He gesticulates wildly for a yellow card but the referee looks at him non-plused. Again this is a good chance for Del Piero to fire one of his trademark wicked crosses...</p> <p><strong>55</strong> Or hit one straight into the first defender, as he does here... </p> <p><strong>58</strong> The Dutch are still - not surprisingly - having the majority of the possession, but they're not looking particularly threatening. Oh wait, Zenden's just hit a smart shot from 20 yards out - but it's straight at Toldo.</p> <p><strong>61</strong> <strong>PENALTY!</strong> David's bursts into the penalty area. And Juliano chops him down. It's a clear penalty despite Juliano's protestions. Will it be one of the De Boers? No this time it's Kluivert...</p> <p><strong>62</strong> <strong>AND HE'S HIT THE POST</strong>. Incredible. Just incredible. It wasn't cleanly struck, but Toldo was going the wrong way...</p> <p><strong>66</strong> <strong>Italy substitution</strong> Inzaghi (sorry spreadbetters, he's had no offsides whatsoever this game) goes off for Delvecchio. Zoff replacing an attacker for another attacker. Now that's bold - for him anyway.</p> <p><strong>68</strong> Zenden fizzles one in but it goes well wide.</p> <p><strong>70</strong> It's all Holland. Surely a goal is just a matter of time. Italy are defending deeper and deeper. Give it ten minutes and they'll be in the stands.</p> <p><strong>71</strong> Del Piero moves out of the way and let's van Bronckhurst shot from 25 yards. It's a decent attempt but it crashes against the stanchion at the back of the goal.</p> <p><strong>72</strong> Davids, who has had a fairly quiet game by his standards, makes one of his trademark 50 yard charges. He's finally brought down 25 yards out by Juliano (how long can it be before that man's sent off?). Jaap Stam looks like he's going to thump one...</p> <p><strong>73</strong> But his free-kick hits Fiore, who can't be more than two yards away from him. Encroachment anyone? Apparently not, according to Mr Merk...</p> <p><strong>75</strong> Yellow card! van Bronckhurst for a challenge on Albertini, who fell down and twisted like a girl. It was never a booking...</p> <p><strong>77</strong> <strong>Holland substitution:</strong> Van Vossen for Zenden. </p> <p><strong>78</strong> <strong>Italy substitution:</strong> Pessotto for Albertini.</p> <p><strong>79</strong> For all Holland's numerical superiority and possession, Toldo hasn't made a top quality save this half, because Nesta has been tremendous. Extra time beckons... </p> <p><strong>81</strong> <strong>Italy substitute:</strong> Totti for Fiore. </p> <p><strong>83</strong> Italy enter the Dutch half for the first time in, oh, about 30 minutes and Delvecchio is suddenly played through. 20 yards out he shoots....</p> <p><strong>84</strong> ...but De Boer blocks it and the Dutch storm straight up the other end. Kluivert finds himself space in the box, but he wants an extra touch and the desperate Italians get a block in...</p> <p><strong>86</strong> <strong>Holland substitution:</strong> Seedoorf on for Bergkamp.</p> <p><strong>87</strong> Juliano fails to clear a looping ball and it falls to Seedoorf 10 yards out. It's his first touch of the match, but that's no excuse for a wee tiddler of a shot which goes straight through Juliano's legs, but straight into Toldo's arms.</p> <p><strong>88</strong> Yellow card! This time it's for Di Biaggio.</p> <p><strong>90</strong> The assistant referee says there will be four minutes of stoppage time. </p> <p><strong>Second half injury time </strong> Delvecchio's played through. He carries the ball on until he's 20 yards out. Stam and De Boer aren't going to catch him. This is Italy's best chance of the entire game. Can he shock the world?</p> <p><strong>93</strong> Oh no... not this time - his shot is straight at Van Der Sar.</p> <p><strong>FULL TIME: Holland 0 - 0 Italy</strong>. It's golden goal time....</p> <p><strong>91</strong> Holland are straight on the attack again. The Italian's are now defending level with the penalty spot.</p> <p><strong>93</strong> But another Holland attack breaks down and Del Piero plays an exquisite ball through to Totti, who is then cynically brought down by Jaap Stam. Not surprisingly, the Manchester United defender receives a yellow card.</p> <p><strong>94</strong> Cocu reverses it to Kluivert. He's got some space in the box but he opts to hit it first time, straight into Toldo's arms. Man, come-on! You should have taken it on...</p> <p><strong>95</strong> <strong>Dutch substitution</strong> Winter comes on for Cocu. That's a touch defensive - surely Van Hoojdoink was a more positive option? </p> <p><strong>96</strong> It really is all hands to the pump now for Italy. The Dutch are producing wave after wave of attacks - but the Azzuri, led by Nesta, are still defending brilliantly - even though gaps are beginning to appear.</p> <p><strong>99</strong> Delvecchio's away again. A long ball is pumped over the top. He's 10 yards out and De Boer is definitely beaten. It's his third great chance of the match - but this one is his best yet. He shoots...</p> <p><strong>100</strong> ...Van der Sar has saved it brilliantly, and the ball goes off for a corner. Saying that, Delvecchio was ahead of De Boer, and he should have cut inside him which would have opened the whole goal.</p> <p><strong>102</strong> Another great block! This time it's Juliano who hurls himself in front of a Bosveldt drive and the ball squirms away. It hasn't been a classic by any means, but it's still incredibly compelling...</p> <p><strong>105</strong> Half time. Just 15 minutes to go before penalties...</p> <p><strong>106</strong> Italy earn a free kick 40 yards out. Del Piero takes it. Poor, poor, poor!!! It's completely overhit and floats harmlessly out for a goal-kick.</p> <p><strong>108</strong> Kluivert and Overmars exchange a great one-two, which sends Kluivert clear. But he shoots with his weaker left foot and it drifts agonisingly wide. Can the Dutch finally seize the day - or are we heading for a shoot-out at the Amsterdam Arena? Which doesn't sound as cool as the shoot-out at the OK Corral - but I bet it will be just as tense...</p> <p><strong>109</strong> Kluivert again drifts into the area and wins a (slightly fortunate) corner. But he injures himself in the process and goes off the pitch.</p> <p><strong>111</strong> The corner comes to nothing. Kluivert had just a minor knock on his ankle and is now back on the field.</p> <p><strong>113</strong> Both teams are now very tired, but despite having the extra man and most of the possession, Holland aren't creating many chances. Will the Dutch regret substituting Bergkamp? </p> <p><strong>115</strong> Seedorf shoots wide. Overmars finds space but fails to get a cross in. And Van Vossen is brilliantly tackled by Maldini. All in the space of a minute.</p> <p><strong>117</strong> Want to know the pattern of the last 70-odd minutes? Basically the Dutch bring it within 35 yards of the Italian goal, then exchange a pretty one-two. Their attack looks dangerous, but the final ball always seems to let them down. </p> <p><strong>118</strong> There's now just two minutes of extra time left (plus stoppage time) before penalties...</p> <p><strong>119</strong> The ball is crossed in, but Kluivert doesn't connect properly with the header and it goes off for a goal kick. We're now in the last minute...</p> <p><strong>120</strong> Oh no we're not. There's going to be two extra minutes of stoppage time. Can the Dutch steal it at the death?</p> <p><strong>121</strong> Thirty seconds to go and the Dutch win a free-kick in a dangerous position... But the Italian clear yet again.</p> <p><strong>FULL TIME - We now have penalties</strong>.</p> <p>Looking through the record books, both sides have atrocious records in penalty shoot-outs. But somebody's got to win it...</p> <p>Italy will take the first penalty, but they're shooting into the goal at the Dutch end of the ground.</p> <p>Di Biaggo will take the first penalty - the man who missed one in Paris in the World Cup two two years ago - he runs up...</p> <p><strong>And he scores. 1-0 Italy.</strong></p> <p>It's Frank De Boer to step up for Holland.</p> <p><strong>SAVED! It's staight at Toldo and he saves it! Still 1-0 Italy.</strong></p> <p>Pessotto steps up.</p> <p><strong>He scores! 2-0 Italy.</strong></p> <p>Jaap Stam will be next. Surely he has to score.</p> <p><strong> NOOOOOO! He's blazed it way, way, over.</strong> The ball's now in orbit, and it's still 2-0 to Italy. </p> <p><strong>3-0</strong> Totti scoops the ball brilliantly over the flailing Van der Sar.</p> <p><strong>Kluivert scores. Now it's 3-1.</strong></p> <p>Maldini steps up. If he can score this then the Azzuri are in the final. </p> <p><strong>No! Van Der Sar blocks it! It's still 3-1 and Holland are just about still in the game.</strong></p> <p>Now it's Bosveldt's turn to take one....</p> <p><strong>SAVED! What a game Toldo has had</strong>. </p> <p>Italy are through - Holland are out. Incredible - but the Dutch only have themselves to blame. <strong>An exceptionally unhappy Frank Rijkaard resigns immediately after the game</strong>.</p>",

Davids brings down Albertini 25 yards out. It's central and Del Piero is eyeing it the same way the Big Bad wolf eyed Little Red Riding Hood... 50 But.his lame shot strikes the wall and goes over the bar. Italy can't make anything with resulting the corner. 54 Holland have started sloppily this half, and Italy are actually attacking more with 11 men than ten. Inzaghi is fouled by Stam on corner of the box. He gesticulates wildly for a yellow card but the referee looks at him non-plused. Again this is a good chance for Del Piero to fire one of his trademark wicked crosses... 55 Or hit one straight into the first defender, as he does here... 58 The Dutch are still - not surprisingly - having the majority of the possession, but they're not looking particularly threatening. Oh wait, Zenden's just hit a smart shot from 20 yards out - but it's straight at Toldo. 61 PENALTY! David's bursts into the penalty area. And Juliano chops him down. It's a clear penalty despite Juliano's protestions. Will it be one of the De Boers? No this time it's Kluivert... 62 AND HE'S HIT THE POST. Incredible. Just incredible. It wasn't cleanly struck, but Toldo was going the wrong way... 66 Italy substitution Inzaghi (sorry spreadbetters, he's had no offsides whatsoever this game) goes off for Delvecchio. Zoff replacing an attacker for another attacker. Now that's bold - for him anyway. 68 Zenden fizzles one in but it goes well wide. 70 It's all Holland. Surely a goal is just a matter of time. Italy are defending deeper and deeper. Give it ten minutes and they'll be in the stands. 71 Del Piero moves out of the way and let's van Bronckhurst shot from 25 yards. It's a decent attempt but it crashes against the stanchion at the back of the goal. 72 Davids, who has had a fairly quiet game by his standards, makes one of his trademark 50 yard charges. He's finally brought down 25 yards out by Juliano (how long can it be before that man's sent off?). Jaap Stam looks like he's going to thump one... 73 But his free-kick hits Fiore, who can't be more than two yards away from him. Encroachment anyone? Apparently not, according to Mr Merk... 75 Yellow card! van Bronckhurst for a challenge on Albertini, who fell down and twisted like a girl. It was never a booking... 77 Holland substitution: Van Vossen for Zenden. 78 Italy substitution: Pessotto for Albertini. 79 For all Holland's numerical superiority and possession, Toldo hasn't made a top quality save this half, because Nesta has been tremendous. Extra time beckons... 81 Italy substitute: Totti for Fiore. 83 Italy enter the Dutch half for the first time in, oh, about 30 minutes and Delvecchio is suddenly played through. 20 yards out he shoots.... 84 ...but De Boer blocks it and the Dutch storm straight up the other end. Kluivert finds himself space in the box, but he wants an extra touch and the desperate Italians get a block in... 86 Holland substitution: Seedoorf on for Bergkamp. 87 Juliano fails to clear a looping ball and it falls to Seedoorf 10 yards out. It's his first touch of the match, but that's no excuse for a wee tiddler of a shot which goes straight through Juliano's legs, but straight into Toldo's arms. 88 Yellow card! This time it's for Di Biaggio. 90 The assistant referee says there will be four minutes of stoppage time. Second half injury time Delvecchio's played through. He carries the ball on until he's 20 yards out. Stam and De Boer aren't going to catch him. This is Italy's best chance of the entire game. Can he shock the world? 93 Oh no... not this time - his shot is straight at Van Der Sar. FULL TIME: Holland 0 - 0 Italy. It's golden goal time.... 91 Holland are straight on the attack again. The Italian's are now defending level with the penalty spot. 93 But another Holland attack breaks down and Del Piero plays an exquisite ball through to Totti, who is then cynically brought down by Jaap Stam. Not surprisingly, the Manchester United defender receives a yellow card. 94 Cocu reverses it to Kluivert. He's got some space in the box but he opts to hit it first time, straight into Toldo's arms. Man, come-on! You should have taken it on... 95 Dutch substitution Winter comes on for Cocu. That's a touch defensive - surely Van Hoojdoink was a more positive option? 96 It really is all hands to the pump now for Italy. The Dutch are producing wave after wave of attacks - but the Azzuri, led by Nesta, are still defending brilliantly - even though gaps are beginning to appear. 99 Delvecchio's away again. A long ball is pumped over the top. He's 10 yards out and De Boer is definitely beaten. It's his third great chance of the match - but this one is his best yet. He shoots... 100 ...Van der Sar has saved it brilliantly, and the ball goes off for a corner. Saying that, Delvecchio was ahead of De Boer, and he should have cut inside him which would have opened the whole goal. 102 Another great block! This time it's Juliano who hurls himself in front of a Bosveldt drive and the ball squirms away. It hasn't been a classic by any means, but it's still incredibly compelling... 105 Half time. Just 15 minutes to go before penalties... 106 Italy earn a free kick 40 yards out. Del Piero takes it. Poor, poor, poor!!! It's completely overhit and floats harmlessly out for a goal-kick. 108 Kluivert and Overmars exchange a great one-two, which sends Kluivert clear. But he shoots with his weaker left foot and it drifts agonisingly wide. Can the Dutch finally seize the day - or are we heading for a shoot-out at the Amsterdam Arena? Which doesn't sound as cool as the shoot-out at the OK Corral - but I bet it will be just as tense... 109 Kluivert again drifts into the area and wins a (slightly fortunate) corner. But he injures himself in the process and goes off the pitch. 111 The corner comes to nothing. Kluivert had just a minor knock on his ankle and is now back on the field. 113 Both teams are now very tired, but despite having the extra man and most of the possession, Holland aren't creating many chances. Will the Dutch regret substituting Bergkamp? 115 Seedorf shoots wide. Overmars finds space but fails to get a cross in. And Van Vossen is brilliantly tackled by Maldini. All in the space of a minute. 117 Want to know the pattern of the last 70-odd minutes? Basically the Dutch bring it within 35 yards of the Italian goal, then exchange a pretty one-two. Their attack looks dangerous, but the final ball always seems to let them down. 118 There's now just two minutes of extra time left (plus stoppage time) before penalties... 119 The ball is crossed in, but Kluivert doesn't connect properly with the header and it goes off for a goal kick. We're now in the last minute... 120 Oh no we're not. There's going to be two extra minutes of stoppage time. Can the Dutch steal it at the death? 121 Thirty seconds to go and the Dutch win a free-kick in a dangerous position... But the Italian clear yet again. FULL TIME - We now have penalties. Looking through the record books, both sides have atrocious records in penalty shoot-outs. But somebody's got to win it... Italy will take the first penalty, but they're shooting into the goal at the Dutch end of the ground. Di Biaggo will take the first penalty - the man who missed one in Paris in the World Cup two two years ago - he runs up... And he scores. 1-0 Italy. It's Frank De Boer to step up for Holland. SAVED! It's staight at Toldo and he saves it! Still 1-0 Italy. Pessotto steps up. He scores! 2-0 Italy. Jaap Stam will be next. Surely he has to score. NOOOOOO! He's blazed it way, way, over. The ball's now in orbit, and it's still 2-0 to Italy. 3-0 Totti scoops the ball brilliantly over the flailing Van der Sar. Kluivert scores. Now it's 3-1. Maldini steps up. If he can score this then the Azzuri are in the final. No! Van Der Sar blocks it! It's still 3-1 and Holland are just about still in the game. Now it's Bosveldt's turn to take one.... SAVED! What a game Toldo has had. Italy are through - Holland are out. Incredible - but the Dutch only have themselves to blame. An exceptionally unhappy Frank Rijkaard resigns immediately after the game.",

      "body": "<p> <strong>shem32</strong> <br> I've read quite a few otherworldly Victoriana novels recently - Peter Carey's Jack Maggs, Sarah Waters' Affinity, your Laura Blundy. Do you think it's a phase the early 2000's are going through?</p> <p><strong>JulieMyerson</strong><br> I'm not sure about phases (and though I love Peter Carey generally I thought Jack Maggs was more like a piece of repro furniture - beautifully done, but what's the point? All I know is that I wanted a different landscape, somewhere exciting and (to me at least) new to go when I was writing.</p> <p> I'm sure I ended up writing about the same old things (motherhood, love, ghosts, darkness) but to me it felt new and that was important. But other people have made the same point as you - I think it's sometimes possible that ideas are sort of in the air and you pick up on them - so suddenly you get a whole lot of writers doing something slightly similar ...</p> <p><strong>btanzilo</strong> <br> I am about halfway through the new book (in its galley form here in the US - I work at an independent bookseller) and I have a question about the era. It took me a bit of time to grasp the fact that the story takes place in a Victorian setting. My mind began to assemble what seem like clues to the time period, rather than knowing it from the start. Was this on purpose or am I simply a dim bulb? If it was your intention to insinuate rather than state the era, what was your reasoning? Do you feel the era is crucial to the story or more incidental. Is it a story that couldn't be set in London in 2000? </p> <p> Anyway, a Bristol-born friend of mine introduced me to your books earlier this year and I have since devoured (it seems an appropriate word) all of them and was happy to discover a galley of the new one here in the shops.</p> <p><strong>JulieMyerson</strong> <br> Hello Bobby - who's your Bristol friend? i went to university in Bristol ... do I know him/her? To answer: no, you're not a dim bulb and yes, you're absolutely right on everything. I wanted the reader to be unsettled, confused, to have the rug pulled from under their feet a little. This is not easy-on-the-eye history, no balls, bonnets or sweet ladies with baskets on their arms. </p> <p>I wanted to write about Victorian times in a modern, non-cliched way, getting rid of all the stuff we automatically bring to it (from costume dramas on TV and even a lot of fake Victorian novels). I wanted to make the people speak in a normal way, using the kind of slang that I'm sure they would have used but that novelists of the time did not always choose/feel able to write. I'm not good at history, but a couple of historians I've come across have confirmed this to be so. </p> <p>And the story? Well, I'm not sure if it could be set in London now - my characters are living at street level in a way that only the homeless do now... to me the era felt crucial because I wanted the atmosphere of the river, and was especially inspired by photos of London before the embankments, sewers and underground railways were built. Everything was awkward, smelly, inept and skewed. </p> <p> <strong> blackbird21 </strong> <br> With all the fuss made over the sex in your previous books, are we to assume Laura Blundy, 'a Victorian pastiche', will not touch on the subject? </p> <p> <strong>JulieMyerson</strong> <br> Page for page there's actually not much sex at all in any of my novels (no, really, I swear it!) - it's just the type of sex. In Sleepwalking, no one could believe I dared write about someone so very bulkily pregnant having and enjoying sex. In fact one (male) publisher who loved the book and wanted to publish it even asked if I could just make my heroine a 'little less pregnant' in the 'bonking scenes'. I did not realise I was addressing a taboo when I wrote it, to me it just seemed like the truth. I just try to write about sex as I truly perceive (or sometimes, let's face it, imagine) it to be - ie. wonderful, terrifying, and with all the bodily fluids, the mess, the uncertainty, the no going backness, etc. </p> <p>I'm proud to do this - and yes, there's a small amount of sex in Laura B and, I suppose, yes, it's sex with an amputee - but what I'm really trying to say is that people are not always beautiful or thin or complete (of limb!) but love with them is still crucial, vital, still the business really... why do hardly any authors seem to write about this? To me it seems an obvious subject, not an exotic or saucy one! </p> <p> <strong> btanzilo </strong> <br> Hello, me again. I had another question after reading blackbird21's. In all of your books sex plays a prominent role, but it's never the type of \"fantasy\"-style sex most authors write, nor is it what most people would call \"normal\" sex - sex with an amputee, sex with a tremendously fat man, pregnant sex. </p> <p> Is this your way of driving home the point (no pun intended) that human sexual experience is not always a fantasy land and that people love one another and make choices based on reasons outside conventional ideas of beauty? </p> <p> Or is it simply a way to spice things up, add dimension to the story? </p> <p> Now i promise to leave you alone. </p> <p> Bobby </p> <p><strong> JulieMyerson </strong> <br> Hi Bobby, back to you. I love your next question because basically you just illustrate and explain what I just said. So YES, absolutely, is the answer - oh, all right, and to spice things up a bit of course. Stories have to have drama, characters who are up against it, with something at stake. Love and sex and whether or not you should/can/dare have it seem to me to be one of the ultimate dramatic situations. </p> <p> <strong> mmreed </strong> <br> Are you already working on your next book? What will it be about? </p> <p><strong>JulieMyerson </strong> <br> Yes I am, but if I tried to describe it it would sound either weird or very boring or both. The ideas I tend to begin a book with (ie very few) always seem very babyish and ludicrous. I just write my way through/into them until the smoke clears and I begin to see what I am writing about. The glimpses you get are SO exciting! The world seems to be divided into writers who would never write in such a fumbling way and writers who only can. I haven't told anyone this, but at the moment my heroine is called Lindsay and has short hair and an awkward stout body and no confidence in herself and she does a job that is very repellent to people. Can't tell you any more and all of this may change. (And she's not Victorian, not yet anyway.) </p> <p> <strong> tamara </strong> <br> Dear Julie, who were your first influences to become a writer, and which authors do you rate today?</p> <p><strong> JulieMyerson </strong> <br> So many. I always read and I have always read. At 13 I read all Daphne du Maurier and wrote to her announcing that I was going to be an author like her (!) and asking for advice. She kindly wrote back to me (can't remember the advice) and kept on writing back when I kept on pestering her... she must have been extremely generous to write so many letters and I still have most of them. I loved so many people like Enid Blyton, Noel Streatfield\u00c9and I was amazed to read Tom's Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce to my own children a few years ago and realise that it had influenced me in the writing of Sleepwalking, my first novel (ghosts, time, a sense of longing and beauty and mystery and sadness). </p> <p>Today I love individual books more than writers. My top ones that spring to mind are - in no particular order - Sabbath's Theatre (Roth), Disgrace (Coetzee), A Child In Time (McEwan), The Tax Inspector (Peter Carey), any Updike, Sue Miller, Jane Hamilton, Anne Tyler, Alice Hoffman, Toni Morrison, some of Rupert Thomson, The Salesman by Joseph O'Connor. I'm especially aware that I love American writers (oh yes, and Jane Smiley) and I think it's that I love their lack of uptightness, their natural grace. Too many British writers are too busy being concerned with their own cleverness, instead of just getting on and telling a wonderful story. </p> <p><strong> miner49er </strong> <br> Julie, </p> <p> Are you a pen and paper girl or do you write on a PC? And do you work conventional hours, or do you prefer burning the midnight oil?! </p> <p> <strong> JulieMyerson </strong> <br> Have just moved from an old-fashioned Amstrad to a proper computer so now can email all my writer friends, and I also like that the printer's quick. Have to type, can't read my own handwriting and also can't believe anything I handwrite is any good (I would love to be one of these people who could write a whole novel in an exercise book in a cafe ...). </p> <p>Three kids means I have to write in conventional hours, and on the whole I think that's fine because all this insisting that you can only write at dead of night is like imagining much great art has only ever been written by people who are stoned or drunk. On the other hand, both my man and I sometimes wish we could do that blissful thing of writing till, say, 7 or 8, and then sloping off to a wine bar together and then perhaps just doing another hour later on. Instead it's home at 6.15 and straight into spellings, times tables, the Romans in Britain... ah well, one day. </p> <p> <strong> rgsharp </strong> <br> I liked the way that in Laura Blundy the language of the Victorians was so fresh - because today we can include words they would have considered obscene in a novel. Did you research all this language, and if so where did you find it? Or did you just use your instincts? </p> <p><strong>JulieMyerson </strong> <br> Yes, that's a good question. I did research the language and on the whole I can just about swear that it is all 100% genuine Victorian. But I hope it doesn't sound Victorian and I do want it to make people do a double take, to think hold on, could they have said that then... (to a certain extent I am asking for trouble by doing this, because one or two critics assumed I had tried it on or made mistakes). I chose to use only slang that is either still very much in use today, or else that we haven't ever heard on a BBC costume drama. The music that the language of the book makes in my head is very peculiar and very satisfying to me, and that was the point really. One critic took exception to my characters saying Yeah, but really she was wrong. Of course yeah wasn't written down or spelled like that then, but do we really mean to say that every Victorian from every walk of life always pronounced the 's' on the end of yes? </p> <p> <strong> buttercup23 </strong> <br> I read that your husband is also a novelist, as well as an Oscar-nominated screenwriter. Do you have any plans to collaborate, maybe turning one of your books into a film? Do you find it helps to have a partner who is also a writer?</p> <p><strong> JulieMyerson </strong> <br> Yes! He and I are just about to adapt Laura B for Channel 4 TV, all v exciting though nothing actually signed as yet. We work extremely well together because we have no reverence whatsoever for each other's work. Everyone, including my film agent, agreed that Laura B was unfilmable to start with, but Jonathan has produced a treatment that not only works, it's wonderful. That's the advantage of living with a screenwriter (the drawback is that he is SO BOSSY).</p> <p> <strong>buttercup23 </strong> <br> A recent report found that the majority of writers cannot afford to live off the money that they earn from writing. Do you think that this is a parlous state of affairs, or is it good for writers to get out into the world a bit? How did you sustain yourself while writing Sleepwalking? </p> <p> <strong> JulieMyerson </strong> <br> Of course writers should earn more. I am not at all badly paid for my novels compared to some, but I couldn't live off just my novels so I do bits of journalism that pay so much better for so much less, which is not very gratifying (and the easier and crasser the bit of writing, on the whole the better you will be paid for it). My husband pointed out to me recently that I am paid for my novels at about the same rate as a barista at Pret A Manger. </p> <p>It always sounds grand when a writer gets a large sum for a novel (and if, like me, more than one publisher wants to publish you, then there's competition so at least you get goodish amounts) but, stretched over two or more years, it's pathetic... I'd be happy if I just got paid what an editor of my age gets in any of the major publishing houses. </p> <p> I wrote Sleepwalking at nights and weekends whilst doing a part-time job and having my third baby. We could not afford any childcare on my days off so it was all done in the scraps and fag ends of my day - and with a huge amount of support from my man, who understood how important it was to me that I did it. I had no idea it would be published and, looking back, I don't know how I kept going. It was a delight and a luxury to be able to write the second in the daylight (ie I got paid just about enough to give up the day job...).</p> <p> <strong>blackbird21 </strong> <br> Reading about your rather unusual childhood in a recent magazine article, I wonder whether you agree with the idea that having some emotional upheaval in a life makes for a better writer?</p> <p> <strong> JulieMyerson </strong> <br> It would be nice to think so but I'm not sure, I really don't know - has anyone ever done any research on how many authors who win the Booker have divorced parents? All I know is that though I always thought I coped with my father's rejection of me and subsequent suicide rather well, there are definitely great dark holes in my head that I sometimes seem to explore when I write. I don't understand them and sometimes they scare me (in fact I realised quite recently that I tend to write about all the things that scare me - as a way of keeping control perhaps?). </p> <p>What I'd be writing if I didn't have them I'm not sure, but I am sure I'd be writing. I don't write for therapy but because of the wonderful zingy moment of satisfaction when a group of words come together and express something absolutely perfectly. Yes, that's why I write. </p> <p> <strong>Kudra </strong> <br> Following on from Bobby's question, there don't seem to be many novelists who write about sex in such an honest and unglamorous way - the choice is often between flowery, overblown descriptions, or the crass 'bonking and shagging' of the 'city girl' genre... Why do you think this is? Which other writers do you think tackle this subject in a realistic way?</p> <p><strong>JulieMyerson </strong> <br> Thank you for saying honest and unglamorous, because that's just what I'd like to be. I really honestly don't know why, though I tend to think that British women writers, though extremely clever, are disappointingly coy about sex. I just don't do coy, and I try to write before I think - that's how the best and sharpest things come out. As soon as you think too much you stop telling the truth. </p> <p>I like men like Roth, Updike - as I said before. Life and sex are really pretty much entwined, aren't they - I mean even if you don't do it, you'll have an interesting attitude to not doing it. It's hard to understand much about a character if you don't understand how they feel about sex - that's where I'm coming from, whereas some writers seem to tack sex on as something incidental (and therefore a bit embarrassing). But I have been influenced by a huge number of good writers who can do sex. </p> <p> <strong> shem32 </strong> <br> Does a book begin with a character, or a situation, or a first line - or is it more complicated than that? Do you know what will happen as you write? </p> <p><strong>JulieMyerson </strong> <br> I think I answered this in a previous answer really. But to be more specific, the first line I write is never the one that ends up being the first line of the novel. I do so much editing all the time, going over and over refining and deleting what I've done, sometimes I can barely remember what I began with. But I do think writing novels is half about writing and half about knowing how to be ruthless and edit yourself, how to get rid of a passage even if you spend all day on it if it's not working... I read some bad novels that have simply not been edited by anyone, least of all their authors. </p> <p><strong>trapeze</strong> What's the next trend for women's contemporary fiction now that the 'Bridget Jones' genre seems to have saturated the shelves? Can we expect something a bit more intelligent than the 'get me a boyfriend, save my career' novel? </p> <p><strong>JulieMyerson</strong> Despite the massive publicity and sales, the Bridget Jones genre as you put it is still only a genre - more a product, like a magazine. Literary fiction is what interests me - by which I mean novels written not for quick easy sales, but because the author wants to express ideas/feelings and maybe play around with language/style etc. These novels are all over the tables at, say, Waterstones, all of the time, and they are new, fresh and deeply exciting. Some are not so good (authors take risks which don't always work out) but many are just brilliant. You won't have heard of them like you have Bridget Jones, but I bet you anything that the best of them will last longer. </p> <p><strong> btanzilo </strong> <br> Hello Julie, </p> <p> My Bristol friend is Nick Peters, who, after seven years in America, recently returned to Bristol and bought a house with his hometown sweetie. They've spent the past three months stucco-ing, painting, and comparing swatches. Sickening, really. But before he was in Milwaukee, he was at university in Leeds for a few years, so it's been a long time since he's been in Bristol full-time, so I suspect your having crossed paths with him is unlikely. But he will be excited to know that we discussed him, so I couldn't help but respond to your question. </p> <p> I just thought I'd tell you that I left off last night when Ewan's head bobs back up (p. 207 here in the States)! </p> <p> As a small-minded person, I'm glad that you veiled the Victoriana as I would most likely have put off reading the book and felt a little disappointed that you'd sold out to grannies! Instead, I'm thoroughly enjoying the book, although I love Sleepwalking the best - although that may be because, as in love, there's nothing like the first time. The thrill of discovery, if you will. </p> <p> Cheers, Bobby </p> <p><strong>JulieMyerson </strong> <br> Yes, tell your friend we discussed him and I think Bristol's a great city - in fact, one day I'm going to write a novel set there (Me and the Fat Man, which is published by Ecco in the States, was set in Bath, almost next door ...) Thanks for your great questions. Did you say you were a bookseller? Please try and sell Laura B for me. It comes out in October!</p> <p>Best wishes, Julie</p>",

      "bodyText": "shem32 I've read quite a few otherworldly Victoriana novels recently - Peter Carey's Jack Maggs, Sarah Waters' Affinity, your Laura Blundy. Do you think it's a phase the early 2000's are going through? JulieMyerson I'm not sure about phases (and though I love Peter Carey generally I thought Jack Maggs was more like a piece of repro furniture - beautifully done, but what's the point? All I know is that I wanted a different landscape, somewhere exciting and (to me at least) new to go when I was writing. I'm sure I ended up writing about the same old things (motherhood, love, ghosts, darkness) but to me it felt new and that was important. But other people have made the same point as you - I think it's sometimes possible that ideas are sort of in the air and you pick up on them - so suddenly you get a whole lot of writers doing something slightly similar ... btanzilo I am about halfway through the new book (in its galley form here in the US - I work at an independent bookseller) and I have a question about the era. It took me a bit of time to grasp the fact that the story takes place in a Victorian setting. My mind began to assemble what seem like clues to the time period, rather than knowing it from the start. Was this on purpose or am I simply a dim bulb? If it was your intention to insinuate rather than state the era, what was your reasoning? Do you feel the era is crucial to the story or more incidental. Is it a story that couldn't be set in London in 2000? Anyway, a Bristol-born friend of mine introduced me to your books earlier this year and I have since devoured (it seems an appropriate word) all of them and was happy to discover a galley of the new one here in the shops. JulieMyerson Hello Bobby - who's your Bristol friend? i went to university in Bristol ... do I know him/her? To answer: no, you're not a dim bulb and yes, you're absolutely right on everything. I wanted the reader to be unsettled, confused, to have the rug pulled from under their feet a little. This is not easy-on-the-eye history, no balls, bonnets or sweet ladies with baskets on their arms. I wanted to write about Victorian times in a modern, non-cliched way, getting rid of all the stuff we automatically bring to it (from costume dramas on TV and even a lot of fake Victorian novels). I wanted to make the people speak in a normal way, using the kind of slang that I'm sure they would have used but that novelists of the time did not always choose/feel able to write. I'm not good at history, but a couple of historians I've come across have confirmed this to be so. And the story? Well, I'm not sure if it could be set in London now - my characters are living at street level in a way that only the homeless do now... to me the era felt crucial because I wanted the atmosphere of the river, and was especially inspired by photos of London before the embankments, sewers and underground railways were built. Everything was awkward, smelly, inept and skewed. blackbird21 With all the fuss made over the sex in your previous books, are we to assume Laura Blundy, 'a Victorian pastiche', will not touch on the subject? JulieMyerson Page for page there's actually not much sex at all in any of my novels (no, really, I swear it!) - it's just the type of sex. In Sleepwalking, no one could believe I dared write about someone so very bulkily pregnant having and enjoying sex. In fact one (male) publisher who loved the book and wanted to publish it even asked if I could just make my heroine a 'little less pregnant' in the 'bonking scenes'. I did not realise I was addressing a taboo when I wrote it, to me it just seemed like the truth. I just try to write about sex as I truly perceive (or sometimes, let's face it, imagine) it to be - ie. wonderful, terrifying, and with all the bodily fluids, the mess, the uncertainty, the no going backness, etc. I'm proud to do this - and yes, there's a small amount of sex in Laura B and, I suppose, yes, it's sex with an amputee - but what I'm really trying to say is that people are not always beautiful or thin or complete (of limb!) but love with them is still crucial, vital, still the business really... why do hardly any authors seem to write about this? To me it seems an obvious subject, not an exotic or saucy one! btanzilo Hello, me again. I had another question after reading blackbird21's. In all of your books sex plays a prominent role, but it's never the type of \"fantasy\"-style sex most authors write, nor is it what most people would call \"normal\" sex - sex with an amputee, sex with a tremendously fat man, pregnant sex. Is this your way of driving home the point (no pun intended) that human sexual experience is not always a fantasy land and that people love one another and make choices based on reasons outside conventional ideas of beauty? Or is it simply a way to spice things up, add dimension to the story? Now i promise to leave you alone. Bobby JulieMyerson Hi Bobby, back to you. I love your next question because basically you just illustrate and explain what I just said. So YES, absolutely, is the answer - oh, all right, and to spice things up a bit of course. Stories have to have drama, characters who are up against it, with something at stake. Love and sex and whether or not you should/can/dare have it seem to me to be one of the ultimate dramatic situations. mmreed Are you already working on your next book? What will it be about? JulieMyerson Yes I am, but if I tried to describe it it would sound either weird or very boring or both. The ideas I tend to begin a book with (ie very few) always seem very babyish and ludicrous. I just write my way through/into them until the smoke clears and I begin to see what I am writing about. The glimpses you get are SO exciting! The world seems to be divided into writers who would never write in such a fumbling way and writers who only can. I haven't told anyone this, but at the moment my heroine is called Lindsay and has short hair and an awkward stout body and no confidence in herself and she does a job that is very repellent to people. Can't tell you any more and all of this may change. (And she's not Victorian, not yet anyway.) tamara Dear Julie, who were your first influences to become a writer, and which authors do you rate today? JulieMyerson So many. I always read and I have always read. At 13 I read all Daphne du Maurier and wrote to her announcing that I was going to be an author like her (!) and asking for advice. She kindly wrote back to me (can't remember the advice) and kept on writing back when I kept on pestering her... she must have been extremely generous to write so many letters and I still have most of them. I loved so many people like Enid Blyton, Noel Streatfield\u00c9and I was amazed to read Tom's Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce to my own children a few years ago and realise that it had influenced me in the writing of Sleepwalking, my first novel (ghosts, time, a sense of longing and beauty and mystery and sadness). Today I love individual books more than writers. My top ones that spring to mind are - in no particular order - Sabbath's Theatre (Roth), Disgrace (Coetzee), A Child In Time (McEwan), The Tax Inspector (Peter Carey), any Updike, Sue Miller, Jane Hamilton, Anne Tyler, Alice Hoffman, Toni Morrison, some of Rupert Thomson, The Salesman by Joseph O'Connor. I'm especially aware that I love American writers (oh yes, and Jane Smiley) and I think it's that I love their lack of uptightness, their natural grace. Too many British writers are too busy being concerned with their own cleverness, instead of just getting on and telling a wonderful story. miner49er Julie, Are you a pen and paper girl or do you write on a PC? And do you work conventional hours, or do you prefer burning the midnight oil?! JulieMyerson Have just moved from an old-fashioned Amstrad to a proper computer so now can email all my writer friends, and I also like that the printer's quick. Have to type, can't read my own handwriting and also can't believe anything I handwrite is any good (I would love to be one of these people who could write a whole novel in an exercise book in a cafe ...). Three kids means I have to write in conventional hours, and on the whole I think that's fine because all this insisting that you can only write at dead of night is like imagining much great art has only ever been written by people who are stoned or drunk. On the other hand, both my man and I sometimes wish we could do that blissful thing of writing till, say, 7 or 8, and then sloping off to a wine bar together and then perhaps just doing another hour later on. Instead it's home at 6.15 and straight into spellings, times tables, the Romans in Britain... ah well, one day. rgsharp I liked the way that in Laura Blundy the language of the Victorians was so fresh - because today we can include words they would have considered obscene in a novel. Did you research all this language, and if so where did you find it? Or did you just use your instincts? JulieMyerson Yes, that's a good question. I did research the language and on the whole I can just about swear that it is all 100% genuine Victorian. But I hope it doesn't sound Victorian and I do want it to make people do a double take, to think hold on, could they have said that then... (to a certain extent I am asking for trouble by doing this, because one or two critics assumed I had tried it on or made mistakes). I chose to use only slang that is either still very much in use today, or else that we haven't ever heard on a BBC costume drama. The music that the language of the book makes in my head is very peculiar and very satisfying to me, and that was the point really. One critic took exception to my characters saying Yeah, but really she was wrong. Of course yeah wasn't written down or spelled like that then, but do we really mean to say that every Victorian from every walk of life always pronounced the 's' on the end of yes? buttercup23 I read that your husband is also a novelist, as well as an Oscar-nominated screenwriter. Do you have any plans to collaborate, maybe turning one of your books into a film? Do you find it helps to have a partner who is also a writer? JulieMyerson Yes! He and I are just about to adapt Laura B for Channel 4 TV, all v exciting though nothing actually signed as yet. We work extremely well together because we have no reverence whatsoever for each other's work. Everyone, including my film agent, agreed that Laura B was unfilmable to start with, but Jonathan has produced a treatment that not only works, it's wonderful. That's the advantage of living with a screenwriter (the drawback is that he is SO BOSSY). buttercup23 A recent report found that the majority of writers cannot afford to live off the money that they earn from writing. Do you think that this is a parlous state of affairs, or is it good for writers to get out into the world a bit? How did you sustain yourself while writing Sleepwalking? JulieMyerson Of course writers should earn more. I am not at all badly paid for my novels compared to some, but I couldn't live off just my novels so I do bits of journalism that pay so much better for so much less, which is not very gratifying (and the easier and crasser the bit of writing, on the whole the better you will be paid for it). My husband pointed out to me recently that I am paid for my novels at about the same rate as a barista at Pret A Manger. It always sounds grand when a writer gets a large sum for a novel (and if, like me, more than one publisher wants to publish you, then there's competition so at least you get goodish amounts) but, stretched over two or more years, it's pathetic... I'd be happy if I just got paid what an editor of my age gets in any of the major publishing houses. I wrote Sleepwalking at nights and weekends whilst doing a part-time job and having my third baby. We could not afford any childcare on my days off so it was all done in the scraps and fag ends of my day - and with a huge amount of support from my man, who understood how important it was to me that I did it. I had no idea it would be published and, looking back, I don't know how I kept going. It was a delight and a luxury to be able to write the second in the daylight (ie I got paid just about enough to give up the day job...). blackbird21 Reading about your rather unusual childhood in a recent magazine article, I wonder whether you agree with the idea that having some emotional upheaval in a life makes for a better writer? JulieMyerson It would be nice to think so but I'm not sure, I really don't know - has anyone ever done any research on how many authors who win the Booker have divorced parents? All I know is that though I always thought I coped with my father's rejection of me and subsequent suicide rather well, there are definitely great dark holes in my head that I sometimes seem to explore when I write. I don't understand them and sometimes they scare me (in fact I realised quite recently that I tend to write about all the things that scare me - as a way of keeping control perhaps?). What I'd be writing if I didn't have them I'm not sure, but I am sure I'd be writing. I don't write for therapy but because of the wonderful zingy moment of satisfaction when a group of words come together and express something absolutely perfectly. Yes, that's why I write. Kudra Following on from Bobby's question, there don't seem to be many novelists who write about sex in such an honest and unglamorous way - the choice is often between flowery, overblown descriptions, or the crass 'bonking and shagging' of the 'city girl' genre... Why do you think this is? Which other writers do you think tackle this subject in a realistic way? JulieMyerson Thank you for saying honest and unglamorous, because that's just what I'd like to be.

      "bodyText": "David Copeland, the man who carried out the fatal nail bomb attack on a gay bar in London, was today waiting for an Old Bailey jury to return its verdict on three counts of murder. The jury was told by Judge Michael Hyam to decide whether the nail bomber was suffering from diminished responsibility at the time he launched his attacks on minority targets in London. Copeland, a 24-year-old engineer from Cove, Farnborough, Hants, has admitted causing explosions at Brixton, Brick Lane and Soho in London during 13 days in April last year, killing three people and injuring 129. In his summing up, Judge Hyam said that the burden of proving that Copeland was suffering from diminished responsibility fell on the defence. Copeland, an engineer from Cove, Farnborough, Hants, has admitted causing explosions at Brixton, Brick Lane and Soho in London during 13 days in April last year, killing three people and injuring 129. The blast at the mainly gay Admiral Duncan pub in Soho killed Andrea Dykes, 27, who was pregnant, and her friends John Light, 32, and Nik Moore, 31, all from Essex. He is being tried for their murder after the prosecution refused to accept his plea of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds he was suffering a mental illness - paranoid schizophrenia - which diminished his responsibility at the time. Prosecution psychiatrist Dr Philip Joseph told the trial that he believed Mr Copeland was suffering from a personality disorder that did not impair his responsibility. Nigel Sweeney QC, prosecuting, told the jury in his closing speech yesterday that Copeland had the choice of how to deal with his personality difficulties and \"he chose to go by the bombing route\". \"The prosecution say he suffers from a personality disorder not mental illness - that he is in the old-fashioned phrase, bad, not mentally ill.\" Michael Wolkind QC, defending, told the jury Dr Joseph was wrong in saying Copeland had not been mentally ill. Mr Wolkind said Dr Joseph was \"a man of charm, but as a witness in this case he is neither reliable nor fair.\" He described Dr Joseph as \"isolated, maverick and wrong\" about Copeland. Defence psychiatrists were agreed he had been mentally ill. Mr Wolkind added: \"Please do not approach this case as if Mr Sweeney is presenting this case for the angels and I am presenting the case for the devil.\"",

A recent survey of people with pensions showed that 77% would prefer to invest their money ethically if it made no difference to returns. </p> <p>Ethical investing took a step further yesterday with the launch of the UK's first vegetarian credit card, backed by the former Beatle and famous non-meat eater, Sir Paul McCartney. For every \u00a3100 spent on the Visa card issued by the People's Bank of Connecticut, known as People's Bank in Britain, 35p goes to the Vegetarian Society. Every time someone signs up, the society gets \u00a310. Even the government has acknowledged the importance of the issue: from next month pension fund managers will have to take social, environmental and ethical considerations into account when deciding where to invest members' money. </p> <p>\"The increasing concern many people have about the social and environmental impacts of the activities of some companies is spilling over into the way they think about their pensions and other invest ments,\" says Peter Frankental, business group mananger of Amnesty International UK. </p> <p>Friends Provident were the first to launch an ethical savings vehicle, the Stewardship fund which it launched as long ago as 1984 with a promise to avoid buying into \"bombs, booze and baccy\". These tenets which emerged from Friends Provident's Quaker roots still apply, although the criteria have been extended to incude companies which do not breach any environmental or human rights issue. </p> <p>Other companies have been much slower to catch on and the UK market lags far behind the US, where more than $2 trillion (\u00a31,360bn) is invested ethically. According to the Ethical Investment Research Service (Eiris - an organisation which researches corporate behaviour to check their ethical claims are authentic), the most pressing concerns among savers are the environment, oppressive regimes and conduct in developing countries (whether the company buys from factories using child labour, for example). </p> <p>There is now a comprehensive range of ethical investment products running from bank accounts, affinity cards and mortgages to Isas, pensions and insurance. There are even products tailored to religious beliefs: Muslims may buy into Islamic funds financially engineered so they do not, technically speaking, pay interest - Islam forbids making capital from capital. </p> <p>But ethical investment is not as simple as it may seem. Those who feel very strongly about it may wish to consider the fact that many financial providers offer just one \"green\" product among its conventional ones. The Framlington Health unit trust, for example, is listed as an ethical fund because it puts cash into healthcare stocks. However, some of of these drug companies may be testing on animals during research: anyone who is anti-vivisection would be advised to check in advance. </p> <p>If you invest through a fund, such as an Isa or unit trust, it is unlikely you will know exactly where your money is going to end up because it will be spread across a range of companies. Some companies are banned by one ethical fund and not by others - it depends on the criteria used by the individual fund manager. \"We ourselves do not say what is ethical and what is not,\" explains Karen Eldridge of Eiris. \"For example, British Telecom has a good environmental and social record but it used have a holding in a cable company which broadcast pornographic programmes. That might have been a problem for some people.\" </p> <p>As People's Bank is American, there is little research available on the overall cleanliness of the company's slate, but Ruth Rosselson of Ethical Consumer magazine, suggests: \"To get round the problem we would advise people to go to a bank or investment fund which has an overall ethical policy. In our report we recommended the Co-operative Bank, which is a high-street presence and offers affinity cards of its own.\" </p> <p>Triodos Bank, a small Dutch clearing bank which has a presence in Britain, also has a clearly defined ethical policy. It specialises in banking facilities for charities and projects focusing on social and environmen tal. It aims to channel investments of between \u00a310,000 and \u00a31m into businesses with a clear green or social agenda. This may include organic food production, sustainable transport and social housing. It also offers an Organic Saver account in conjunction with the Soil Association. </p> <p>For green insurance, Ethical Consumer recommends Britannic, Royal London, CGU, Cornhill and Naturesave. The Norwich &amp; Peterborough building society offers a mortgage with preferential rates to borrowers who lag their roof for insulation and the Ecology Building Society has green savings accounts. </p> <p>But does altruism come at a price?

      "bodyText": "Germany's disgraced former chancellor Helmut Kohl today denied taking bribes as he testified for the first time to the committee investigating his party financing scandal. Mr Kohl insisted he had not traded government favours for cash during his 16 years in power. \"The accusation that we were corruptible in our political decisions is absurd,\" an unflappable Mr Kohl said at the end of a one-hour statement he read to a parliamentary investigating committee. \"Never in my entire life has anyone been able to buy me.\" As expected, Mr Kohl also refused to talk about the central issue of the investigation: who gave him some DM2m in undeclared - and thus illegal - campaign funds in the 1990s, names even his own centre-right Christian Democratic party has pressed him to reveal. \"I have acknowledged the mistakes and apologised for them, but I say once again I will not name the anonymous donors,\" Mr Kohl said. Mr Kohl insists the donors were citizens who wanted to support the party's work in former communist East Germany in the early 1990s. He said he had promised them anonymity and refused to break his word. After initial banter with members of a parliamentary investigating committee, Mr Kohl launched into a statement focused on his historic achievements as the chancellor who unified Germany in 1990. Mr Kohl's long-awaited testimony gives him a chance to counter allegations about murky dealings under his administration that have dirtied that reputation. He made no secret of his view that the investigation was a well orchestrated vendetta by the committee - dominated by the governing centre-left parties - to destroy his legacy. \"The real reason is to wipe 16 successful years out of history,\" he said. Mr Kohl also criticised the committee for not hearing his side of the story immediately after the investigation began seven months ago, as he had requested. Mr Kohl will be questioned by committee members for the rest of today's day-long hearing. He is also expected to be called to testify again in the next few months as the committee digs deeper into the allegations. The party financing scandal that erupted last autumn with Mr Kohl's admission that he accepted illegal donations as chancellor has developed into an enduring political drama that dogs the Christian Democratic party he once led. Also under investigation by the parliamentary panel are several business arrangements under the Kohl government in which backroom deals were allegedly agreed, including a tank sale to Saudi Arabia and the privatisation of a major oil refinery in eastern Germany that was sold to French concern Elf Aquitaine. Facing the panel, Mr Kohl denied receiving money to push those deals through and maintained that he was unaware of anyone in his administration being bought off. Earlier testimony by former Kohl aides shed little light on the scandal or the role of a businessman at its centre, Karlheinz Schreiber. Mr Schreiber, currently fighting extradition from Canada on German tax evasion charges, allegedly handed over DM1m in cash to Kohl aides at a Swiss shopping centre in 1991. He was also reportedly involved in the tank sale. But Mr Schreiber shielded the former chancellor in an interview with the news channel n-tv this week, rejecting rumours that he lobbied the Kohl government with cash to support arms deals and other business projects. Mr Schreiber said he had met Mr Kohl a few times but \"at no time\" talked about business. Mr Kohl, whose angry demands to testify early in the hearings were turned down, has been virtually banished from German public life, but he has received a steady string of visiting foreign dignitaries since the scandal broke, including US President Bill Clinton and, this week, French President Jacques Chirac. In the latest accusation of criminal conduct, an independent investigator said large numbers of government files were destroyed during the last days of Mr Kohl's administration. Two-thirds of the chancellery's records - equivalent to 1.2m pieces of paper - were wiped out in late 1998 shortly before Mr Kohl handed over power to newly elected Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, the investigator, Burkhard Hirsch, told the committee yesterday. \"This massive erasing of data lacked any legal basis,\" Mr Hirsch, a former vice president of parliament, said after a four-month investigation of chancellery files ordered by Mr Schroeder.",

He's made a career out of wallowing in a cinematic cesspool. Films like Vampyros Lesbos, Venus In Furs and Necromonicon mix surreal, beautiful images with paper-thin characters, nonsensical plotlines and big-breasted lesbian bloodsuckers gorging on the blood of virgins. Franco obsessed over the way a certain scene looked yet was entirely unconcerned if a character died not once but twice, and flashes of great vision are buried underneath the collective weight of porn and confusion. Now Pete Tombs's documentary on this true iconoclast, The Diabolical Mr Franco, goes some way towards helping us understand what made him tick. </p> <p>Born in May 1930 to upper-middle-class parents, Franco received a highbrow weaning at the Real Conservatorio, Madrid, before going on to direct his first feature film, 1959's Tenemos 18 A\u00f1os, at the age of 29. Although no masterpiece, it showed enough promise to provide Franco with backers for future projects, and his first horror film, 1961's The Awful Dr Orloff, was to make his name. The story covered similar territory to Georges Franchu's Eyes Without A Face: a mad scientist, played by Howard Vernon, kidnaps young women for the purpose of using their skin to graft onto the face of his daughter, who's been disfigured in an accident. Dr Orloff was the first of its kind: an atmospheric, stylish horror film with nudity and gore, and it resulted in its director being held up as Spain's answer to Jean-Luc Godard. General Franco was in power, the Catholic Church had a moral stranglehold on the country, and the film was banned then subsequently championed as a symbol of freedom. Franco caught the attention of Orson Welles, who was shooting Chimes Of Midnight in Spain and looking for an assistant director, and although the two fell out before the film was over, Franco admired Welles's determination to go his own way. </p> <p>From then on, Franco appeared intent on rejecting any notions of good taste and craftsmanship. \"He doesn't actually seem to like his films at all\", claims Pete Tombs. \"But he likes the process of making movies and couldn't care less about the outcome. He's a terribly learned guy, he can speak fluently in Italian, French, Spanish and English, but half the time he can't even remember which film he's supposed to be making.\" A more liberal mood after the death of General Franco in 1975 changed nothing for Jess; having stuck two fingers up at the establishment for so many years, he wasn't about to change just because his films were being praised for their pushing of cinematic boundaries. \"The films got worse and worse, and more pornographic\", says Tombs. \"It was like he was saying, 'They say they like me now, let's see what they think of this.'\" </p> <p>There were some fine Franco moments, though. Necromonicon (1967), adapted from a medieval book on the occult, is often held up as his greatest film: the story of a beautiful young woman (what else?) who's being used by a demon to collect the souls of fallen people, it starts with the memorable voiceover: \"Could it be a mystique that has enclosed us in a masquerade, or a cruel illusion... who knows?\" Vampyros Lesbos (1970) starred the black-eyed Soledad Miranda as a mysterious countess who lures young women to her castle in Istanbul so that she can gorge on their blood. None of it makes much sense, but Miranda, who died as a result of a car crash before the film was completed, is utterly beguiling. </p> <p>Daniel Lesoeur, a Parisian producer who's worked with Franco on 20 films, has faith in the wayward Spaniard as a real artist. \"In the way that a painter has to paint every week, Jess has the same feeling about making movies. He has this in his blood, he has something to say.\" It's not always clear what exactly he is saying, however. \"He forgets the story sometimes. But he always puts something of himself in his movies.\" Franco and Lesoeur are currently raising money for a remake of The Awful Dr Orloff, with effete German actor Udo Kier in the title role. </p> <p>Jess Franco has a unique way of making movies. He rarely writes a script, and even if he does it's only a couple of hours before shooting. He likes to do everything himself on set, but leaves the completion of the film to somebody else. He considers himself a feminist and claims that he hates porn, but the films look like manifestations of his erotic fantasies. And he'll run over the same themes again and again, but never bother to tell a story. Perhaps this succinct explanation by one of his favourite leading men, French actor Michael Lemaine, is the most satisfactory: \"He's a total madman.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Eurotika!

      "trailText": "<p>Michael Ellison talks to Sam Phillips, the man who created rock'n'roll, Elvis Presley - and Holiday Inn</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Ask Sam Phillips if he is happy to be known as the man who invented rock'n'roll and he speaks of many things - the Tennessee river, radio masts, the effects of Rocky Mountain spider fever, beautiful accidents, racial integration, the importance of family - before eventually getting down to it. </p> <p>\"The man who invented rock'n'roll? It's a big thing to say. I have had more accolades than I deserve.\" He is at home in upscale East Memphis, where the sideboard is stuffed with music-industry awards. Outside are two Cadillacs and a Lincoln. \"Still, nobody can beat me behind a damn control board, nobody can beat me on sound, nobody can beat me on getting stuff out of people. Nobody can beat me in turning those damn knobs.\" </p> <p>It's hard to argue with that. Put simply, the case for Phillips is that without his gifts as a producer there would have been no Elvis Presley and no rock'n'roll, and today's music scene would be very different. </p> <p>It all began in 1945 when Phillips, the son of dirt-poor Alabama farmers, arrived to work as a radio sound engineer in Memphis, which at that time was the home of the blues. Labouring on the nightly big-band broadcasts from the Peabody hotel was not enough, and in 1950 he opened the Memphis Recording Service with the slogan: \"We record anything - anywhere - anytime.\" Before long, he had worked with a staggering array of black talent, including BB King, Howlin' Wolf, Little Milton, Junior Parker and Rufus Thomas. \"It was hard as hell,\" he recalls. \"Blacks needed to have a forum for their music - there wasn't a radio station on every corner.\" </p> <p>In 1951 Phillips produced the first rock'n'roll record, Rocket 88, credited to Jackie Brenston, though much of the creative input came from Ike Turner. And then came Elvis, a white man who sang like he was black. \"Now let me tell you,\" says Phillips, a puckish, bearded figure. \"Elvis had a beautiful voice. Untrained, and that was good. I like to sculpture some thing that hasn't been trampled on by someone else. We weren't going to go out there and try to be a Sinatra with this young dude, or Dean Martin. We weren't interested in that.\" </p> <p>Presley first visited the studio in 1953, but it took a year before the pioneer and the young singer perfected Presley's new sound. It was a process that Phillips still doesn't entirely understand. \"Hell, inventions are not just something that is physical, you know? You get down the road a little bit and think, 'How did we do this?' \" </p> <p>By now Phillips had set up his own label, Sun Records. Sun released Presley's first single, That's Alright Mama, and followed it with four more. But Presley was not to stay long. Beset by financial woes and the machinations of Colonel Tom Parker, soon to be the boy's manager, Phillips decided to pursue one of the many offers from rival labels. He asked RCA for the then unthinkable sum of $35,000 for Presley's contract. Phillips could have gone with him in 1956 but chose to stay independent. \"Music deserves better than the big companies that just look at the bottom line. I just thought that music was a spiritual part of a man's soul. I don't give a damn if it's rock'n'roll or Skostovich, whatever his name is. Shostakovich, that's who I was trying to think of. I didn't have one ounce of trouble in turning down RCA when they made me an offer.\" </p> <p>At first his relationship with Presley was akin to that of father and son. Phillips, a details addict, says: \"I am 12 years and three days older than Elvis.\" In time, the two became more like brothers, and even after Presley moved to RCA they remained close - almost embarrassingly so. \"He came here one night and he really looked sick,\" says Phillips. \"He was not feeling good. He said, 'I've got something we got to talk about. Man, I've got a sore on my stomach and I just don't know what it is.' I said, 'Drop your pants,' and right above his pubic hair was this great big carbuncle. Man, it was Mount Vesuvius. </p> <p>\"He thought he might have syphilis. I said, 'You might have syphilis but that's not a part of it.' He'd been worrying about this thing for about three months. In the end the doctor just lanced it. </p> <p>\"Elvis had a lot of pride - that's why he didn't like it when he got to look so bad. He could bloat and then lose weight. Nothing but water retention. I truly believe that Elvis would've been alive today and off that pills bullshit if he'd had Johnny Cash's constitution.\" </p> <p>Phillips, the subject of a documentary to be shown at the National Film Theatre next month, quit music in the late 60s and made his fortune in a very different field. One day the owner of a Memphis hotel stopped by the Sun studio, the two became friends and Phillips bought into the man's business. The hotel grew into the Holiday Inn chain. \"I made more money in a year than I ever made in the record business.\" </p> <p>Phillips, who also owns radio stations in the south, long resisted telling his story. He was finally persuaded to do so by his son Knox and the author Peter Guralnick, who wrote the new documentary. \"Knox was always on to me to do my book before a jealous husband killed me.\" </p> <p>He never did come up with another candidate for the title of the man who invented rock'n'roll. </p> <p>\u0095 The Man Who Invented Rock'n'Roll is screened at the National Film Theatre, London SE1 on July 12.

      "bodyText": "Ask Sam Phillips if he is happy to be known as the man who invented rock'n'roll and he speaks of many things - the Tennessee river, radio masts, the effects of Rocky Mountain spider fever, beautiful accidents, racial integration, the importance of family - before eventually getting down to it. \"The man who invented rock'n'roll? It's a big thing to say. I have had more accolades than I deserve.\" He is at home in upscale East Memphis, where the sideboard is stuffed with music-industry awards. Outside are two Cadillacs and a Lincoln. \"Still, nobody can beat me behind a damn control board, nobody can beat me on sound, nobody can beat me on getting stuff out of people. Nobody can beat me in turning those damn knobs.\" It's hard to argue with that. Put simply, the case for Phillips is that without his gifts as a producer there would have been no Elvis Presley and no rock'n'roll, and today's music scene would be very different. It all began in 1945 when Phillips, the son of dirt-poor Alabama farmers, arrived to work as a radio sound engineer in Memphis, which at that time was the home of the blues. Labouring on the nightly big-band broadcasts from the Peabody hotel was not enough, and in 1950 he opened the Memphis Recording Service with the slogan: \"We record anything - anywhere - anytime.\" Before long, he had worked with a staggering array of black talent, including BB King, Howlin' Wolf, Little Milton, Junior Parker and Rufus Thomas. \"It was hard as hell,\" he recalls. \"Blacks needed to have a forum for their music - there wasn't a radio station on every corner.\" In 1951 Phillips produced the first rock'n'roll record, Rocket 88, credited to Jackie Brenston, though much of the creative input came from Ike Turner. And then came Elvis, a white man who sang like he was black. \"Now let me tell you,\" says Phillips, a puckish, bearded figure. \"Elvis had a beautiful voice. Untrained, and that was good. I like to sculpture some thing that hasn't been trampled on by someone else. We weren't going to go out there and try to be a Sinatra with this young dude, or Dean Martin. We weren't interested in that.\" Presley first visited the studio in 1953, but it took a year before the pioneer and the young singer perfected Presley's new sound. It was a process that Phillips still doesn't entirely understand. \"Hell, inventions are not just something that is physical, you know? You get down the road a little bit and think, 'How did we do this?' \" By now Phillips had set up his own label, Sun Records. Sun released Presley's first single, That's Alright Mama, and followed it with four more. But Presley was not to stay long. Beset by financial woes and the machinations of Colonel Tom Parker, soon to be the boy's manager, Phillips decided to pursue one of the many offers from rival labels. He asked RCA for the then unthinkable sum of $35,000 for Presley's contract. Phillips could have gone with him in 1956 but chose to stay independent. \"Music deserves better than the big companies that just look at the bottom line. I just thought that music was a spiritual part of a man's soul. I don't give a damn if it's rock'n'roll or Skostovich, whatever his name is. Shostakovich, that's who I was trying to think of. I didn't have one ounce of trouble in turning down RCA when they made me an offer.\" At first his relationship with Presley was akin to that of father and son. Phillips, a details addict, says: \"I am 12 years and three days older than Elvis.\" In time, the two became more like brothers, and even after Presley moved to RCA they remained close - almost embarrassingly so. \"He came here one night and he really looked sick,\" says Phillips. \"He was not feeling good. He said, 'I've got something we got to talk about. Man, I've got a sore on my stomach and I just don't know what it is.' I said, 'Drop your pants,' and right above his pubic hair was this great big carbuncle. Man, it was Mount Vesuvius. \"He thought he might have syphilis. I said, 'You might have syphilis but that's not a part of it.' He'd been worrying about this thing for about three months. In the end the doctor just lanced it. \"Elvis had a lot of pride - that's why he didn't like it when he got to look so bad. He could bloat and then lose weight. Nothing but water retention. I truly believe that Elvis would've been alive today and off that pills bullshit if he'd had Johnny Cash's constitution.\" Phillips, the subject of a documentary to be shown at the National Film Theatre next month, quit music in the late 60s and made his fortune in a very different field. One day the owner of a Memphis hotel stopped by the Sun studio, the two became friends and Phillips bought into the man's business. The hotel grew into the Holiday Inn chain. \"I made more money in a year than I ever made in the record business.\" Phillips, who also owns radio stations in the south, long resisted telling his story. He was finally persuaded to do so by his son Knox and the author Peter Guralnick, who wrote the new documentary. \"Knox was always on to me to do my book before a jealous husband killed me.\" He never did come up with another candidate for the title of the man who invented rock'n'roll. \u0095 The Man Who Invented Rock'n'Roll is screened at the National Film Theatre, London SE1 on July 12.

Closer inspection reveals the boulders are painted with a well-known corporate logo. The words \"Coca-Cola\" loom into view. In case you missed them in English, they are also written in florid Hindi. The fact that Coca-Cola has taken to advertising on boulders alongside India's holiest river is a symbol, its critics say, of its increasing desperation. </p> <p>The rocks are just a small salvo in what is shaping up to be one of the world's most entertaining corporate battles. Over in Bollywood, far away from the serene Ganges, the war between Coca-Cola and Pepsi in India has taken a sharply comic twist. Two months ago, Coca-Cola hired Bollywood's latest sensation, the rippling Hrithik Roshan, to front a new advertising campaign. Roshan has only appeared in one film. But he is already a superstar on the subcontinent, inspiring adulation from teenage girls and - it is said - less than maternal feelings from their mothers. (\"They had to keep me down because I was getting so excited,\" Ritu Chadha, a 38-year-old Delhi-based exporter said, after watching Roshan in action with her children. \"To me he looks like Jesus Christ.\" A 45-year-old woman from Mumbai added: \"I react to him.\" She has watched his film 10 times.) </p> <p>Pepsi was quick to respond. It released its own ad, starring Shah Rukh Khan, India's answer to Tom Cruise, poking fun at the muscle-bound Roshan. In the Pepsi commercial a Roshan lookalike wearing ugly braces on his teeth makes a brief appearance, only to be rejected by a pretty girl who kisses Khan instead. This, in itself, is something of a risque departure for Indian advertising. Roshan, in the words of one Pepsi executive, then \"whinged\". He fired off a letter complaining that as a novice in the cinema industry, he did not deserve to be lampooned. His fans wrote angry letters to newspapers. And in Calcutta, where Roshan's granny lives, there were even anti-Pepsi demonstrations. The actor's father, Rakesh Roshan, a successful Bollywood film-maker, who artfully turned his son into a star by directing and producing his debut movie Kaho Naa . . . Pyaar Hai (Say That You Love), also entered the fray. Pepsi was only \"ridiculing\" his son because it lost the bidding war to sign him up, he said. </p> <p>This merry opera bouffe then took a more sinister turn. On June 22, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) - a powerful Hindu nationalist militia with close links to India's rightwing government - launched an attack on Khan and his equally famous actor brothers, Aamir, Salman and Saif. It claimed the Khans were part of a Muslim/mafia conspiracy to keep Hindu actors out of Bollywood, adding that the Pepsi ad poking fun at Roshan was an \"ugly attempt\" to discredit the Hindu actor. The RSS then suggested that cola in India was being drunk along communal lines: with Muslims choosing Pepsi and Hindus Coca-Cola. Both firms dismissed the RSS intervention as ludicrous. The Khans have long been popular with all sections of India's passionate movie-going community - and with audiences outside India: it was the spectacle of Khan gyrating on the roof of a train in the hit film Dil Se which persuaded Andrew Lloyd-Webber to set his next musical in Bollywood. </p> <p>The feud between Roshan and Khan is merely the sub-plot in a bigger, global drama. At stake is control of the world's soft drinks industry. Ever since Coke was thrown out of India in 1977 for not revealing its secret recipe, it has been struggling to regain a foothold on the subcontinent. Unusually, India is one of the few countries in the world where Pepsi enjoys market dominance. Coke returned to India in 1993 with a bang by buying Thums Up, India's indigenous and comically misspelt cola brand. But by then it was too late. Pepsi had arrived two years earlier, and had cornered most of the $1bn (\u00a3600m) market. Pepsi is currently the number one cola in India, followed by Thums Up and Coke. Over the past seven years Coke has pumped $700m (\u00a3430m) into India. Elsewhere in Asia it has also been trying to topple Pepsi, which is ahead in Pakistan, Thailand and much of the Middle East. Last Wednesday the first consignment of Coke trundled across the Chinese border into North Korea. </p> <p>Pepsi has responded to this multi-pronged assault by playing the underdog card. \"The big difference between the two companies is that we have a sense of humour,\" Vibha Risha, Pepsi's marketing director in India, claimed. When Coca-Cola acquired the rights to the 1996 cricket world cup for $4m, Pepsi produced a series of irreverent adverts poking fun at the official sponsor. Its subsequent campaigns have been almost entirely focused on young people, who constitute half of India's 150m soft drinks buyers. Coke's ads, by contrast, have had more of a broad family appeal. Pepsi, the firm would like to make out, is a tiny David battling a po-faced, establishment Goliath. </p> <p>Back in Bombay, Roshan appears to have got over his earlier distress. \"I met him recently at a couple of parties,\" said Prahlad Kakkar, who made the Roshan spoof ad. \"I said: 'I hope you didn't mind'. He replied: 'Everybody has been over-reacting.' He's a pretty cool kid.\" Coke is gambling that a combination of relentless advertising (\"Half the walls in India are held up by our ads,\" one Coke executive said) and the Roshan factor will eventually pay off. </p> <p>It is something of an irony, then, that in a ragingly hot country like India, most people do not drink cola. There is no mystery here: they are simply too poor. When the price of a 300ml bottle of cola went up last year from eight to nine rupees (15p), sales slumped. Even among those who do buy cola, consumption is low. India's per capita consumption of soft drinks is only six bottles a year, compared with 15 in Pakistan, 22 in China and more than 600 in Mexico. The fond hope among cola executives is that lifestyle patterns are changing in a country where more than a third of the one billion population is under 18. \"It's a vast untapped market out there,\" Deepak Jolly, Pepsi's spokesman, said. His opposite number at Coke, Rahul Dhawan, points out that cola is still regarded in India as a special treat, bought only at children's birthday parties, cinemas and festivals. He wants to change that. </p> <p>Roshan, meanwhile, is pondering the weight of celebrity. \"I get out of bed, go out and the traffic stops. It's hard to digest,\" he said recently. He is more reclusive these days: busy with his next two films, his girlfriend Suzanne, his low-calorie shakes, and the weights. The industry buzz is not very kind - \"Turkeys of the worst kind\", one Bollywood insider said of his new movies. But the consensus is that Roshan has enough talent to come through. </p> <p>Back at the Ganges, Coca-Cola is busy scrubbing off its advertising from the rocks; the work, the company says, of a renegade local distributor. Soon the boulders will look like they did at the beginning of time, before advertising and cola were invented.</p>",

He's a pretty cool kid.\" Coke is gambling that a combination of relentless advertising (\"Half the walls in India are held up by our ads,\" one Coke executive said) and the Roshan factor will eventually pay off. It is something of an irony, then, that in a ragingly hot country like India, most people do not drink cola. There is no mystery here: they are simply too poor. When the price of a 300ml bottle of cola went up last year from eight to nine rupees (15p), sales slumped. Even among those who do buy cola, consumption is low. India's per capita consumption of soft drinks is only six bottles a year, compared with 15 in Pakistan, 22 in China and more than 600 in Mexico. The fond hope among cola executives is that lifestyle patterns are changing in a country where more than a third of the one billion population is under 18. \"It's a vast untapped market out there,\" Deepak Jolly, Pepsi's spokesman, said. His opposite number at Coke, Rahul Dhawan, points out that cola is still regarded in India as a special treat, bought only at children's birthday parties, cinemas and festivals. He wants to change that. Roshan, meanwhile, is pondering the weight of celebrity. \"I get out of bed, go out and the traffic stops. It's hard to digest,\" he said recently. He is more reclusive these days: busy with his next two films, his girlfriend Suzanne, his low-calorie shakes, and the weights. The industry buzz is not very kind - \"Turkeys of the worst kind\", one Bollywood insider said of his new movies. But the consensus is that Roshan has enough talent to come through. Back at the Ganges, Coca-Cola is busy scrubbing off its advertising from the rocks; the work, the company says, of a renegade local distributor. Soon the boulders will look like they did at the beginning of time, before advertising and cola were invented.",

      "bodyText": "The government is expected to accept all of the recommendations made in the damning Waterhouse report into the sexual abuse of hundreds of children over two decades in North Wales children's homes. The report published in February said that systematic abuse, a climate of violence and a culture of secrecy existed in dozens of children's homes. After a three-year, \u00a313m investigation, Sir Ronald Waterhouse QC made 72 recommendations, calling for sweeping changes to the way local councils, social services and police deal with children in care. He recommended the appointment of an independent children's commissioner for Wales, whistleblowing procedures to allow staff to raise concerns and a children's complaints officer to be appointed in every local authority to deal with allegations of abuse. While ministers are set to accept all of the recommendations when the government formally responds to the report, many of the suggestions will be put out to consultation before any changes are made. Victims of the scandal reacted with anger to the government's response to recommendations made in the damning Waterhouse report. They accused ministers of \"completely ignoring\" them and demanded a national inquiry into child abuse. Steve Messham, spokesman for North Wales Abuse Survivors, said: \"The recommendations do not go far enough and do not apply to the whole of the country. \"We want a national inquiry into child abuse, not just one for North Wales. \"But most importantly, the victims are completely ignored. There is no mention of compensation, counselling or help and support for victims, and the government has failed to pick up on that.\" The report exposed one of the worst child abuse scandals in history. Hundreds of children had been physically, sexually or emotionally abused in care homes in North Wales between 1974 and 1990. The inquiry heard from 240 people abused as children in 40 homes but there are thought to be hundreds more victims. At least 12 victims have committed suicide, one has been convicted for murder and hundreds of others say their lives have been destroyed by the abuse they endured. The report also mentioned 200 people who were abusers, alleged abusers or had failed to protect children in the homes, although not all of them have been named.",

Lucky Break, directed by Peter Cattaneo (The Full Monty) has been written by Stephen Fry and is about prison inmates who put on a musical in order to mount an escape. It will be released next year with the credit 'Made at Ealing Studios'. The second film is Mel Smith's High Heels and Low Lives, written by Kim Fuller (who also has the dubious distinction of being the writer behind Spiceworld). The romance of Ealing, which made classics such as The Lavender Hill Mob, Passport to Pimlico and Whisky Galore, has never faded. The studio's future had looked bleak when the National Film and Television School - which has run it for the past three years as a facility for film and television producers - decided to sell. But a Forever Ealing campaign launched by stars of the British film industry to preserve the 92-year-old home of British classics for film-making, rather than see the land used for a hotel or supermarket has achieved its aims, and Ealing will be producing films once more. Meanwhile, the news that Hollywood is planning remakes of both Kind Heart and Coronets and The Ladykillers testifies to a revival of interest in this previously unfashionable genre.",

      "bodyText": "A Frenchman suspected of killing British student Isabel Peake was found dead yesterday at the Lisbon prison where he was being held. The exact cause of death was not immediately known, but a source at the Lisbon morgue said 21-year-old Sid Ahmed Rezala had set fire to his mattress and inhaled the fumes. He was the prime suspect in the murder of Birmingham University student Isabel Peake, 20, whose partially clothed body was found beside a rail line on October 13 in France. He was arrested in January near Lisbon. He lodged a final appeal against his extradition on June 7 after the supreme court and a lower court had granted France's extradition request. Rezala's appeal questioned whether he would face a jail sentence in his home country of more than 25 years, which is the maximum allowed in Portugal. Under the Portuguese constitution, a defendant cannot be extradited to a country which allows the death sentence or a jail sentence of more than 25 years. Rezala was also wanted for the killing of Corinne Caillaux, a 36-year-old Frenchwoman who was stabbed to death in the bathroom of a train on December 14. Police suspected he committed a third murder involving 20-year-old Emilie Bazin, whose body was found under a pile of coal in the basement of a building in Amiens, northern France, last December. Law and sociology student Isabel Peake, from Staffordshire, was on a one-year course in Limoges, central France, when she was pushed from a high-speed overnight train to Paris just after 4am on October 13. Rezala, a drifter who was part of a gang that robbed train passengers, last month told a French journalist that he had a flash and felt \"ordered\" to kill her. The suspect's French lawyers, Jean-Claude Richard and Joel Batille, heard the news of his death this morning: \"We haven't had official notification of his death, but we have heard it on the news. I find it very surprising that somebody is able to set fire to his cell without being seen or heard,\" Mr Richard said. \"We are very sad that a boy of 21 has died in this way.

But while 71% still grow up in a married family environment this has done little to stem the decline in marriage rates.</p> <p>In the 1950s young couples were four times more likely to marry than they are today, and the mean age at which people marry has steadily risen since 1971, from 24 to 30 for men, and 22 to 28 for women. Only 3% of men and 7% of women under 24 were married in 1998, the period of the study.</p> <p>There has been a rise in the number of people cohabiting in the same period, with 9% of unmarried 19- to 24-year-old men and 18% of women of the same age living together. More than half of all 20- to 24-year-olds have moved out of the family home.</p> <p>An increase in asthma and muscular complaints is thought to be responsible for one of the report's more worrying findings; that 20% of young people suffer from long-standing ailments, an increase of 8% since 1975.</p> <p>Concerns about body image among young women are also borne out. Some 23% of 13- to 15-year-olds said they thought they were too heavy, rising to 28% among 16- to 19-year-olds and 38% for those aged 20 to 24.

      "bodyText": "Britain's young people are the best qualified, and most mobile, defiantly single and sexually liberated young generation ever raised in Britain. They are also the least well-paid group in society, suffer high rates of unemployment, are the most likely victims and perpetrators of crime, take more drugs than any other age group and are sicklier than previous generations. These contrasting views of the nation's 8.7m 13- to 24-year-olds emerged in a survey published yesterday by the Office for National Statistics, examining the transitions made by young people as they move from education to work and from dependence to independence. The majority of young people are raised in families headed by a couple, with 24% coming from single parent families. But while 71% still grow up in a married family environment this has done little to stem the decline in marriage rates. In the 1950s young couples were four times more likely to marry than they are today, and the mean age at which people marry has steadily risen since 1971, from 24 to 30 for men, and 22 to 28 for women. Only 3% of men and 7% of women under 24 were married in 1998, the period of the study. There has been a rise in the number of people cohabiting in the same period, with 9% of unmarried 19- to 24-year-old men and 18% of women of the same age living together. More than half of all 20- to 24-year-olds have moved out of the family home. An increase in asthma and muscular complaints is thought to be responsible for one of the report's more worrying findings; that 20% of young people suffer from long-standing ailments, an increase of 8% since 1975. Concerns about body image among young women are also borne out. Some 23% of 13- to 15-year-olds said they thought they were too heavy, rising to 28% among 16- to 19-year-olds and 38% for those aged 20 to 24. By contrast, more than half of all boys said they were the right weight. The study reveals a marked difference in the experiences and attitudes of boys and girls in relation to health, sex and education. Girls are more likely than boys to be regular smokers by the age of 15 (29% against 19%). The gap narrows as people reach the 20-24 group, with 42% of men and 39% of women smoking regularly. By contrast boys and men are far more prodigious drinkers than women, with 44% of 18- to 20-year-olds claiming to drink more than eight units (four pints) daily, compared with 29% of girls claiming to consume more than six units daily. The 20-24 age group contains society's biggest drinkers regardless of gender, with regular extreme alcohol consumption tailing off as people pass into their mid-20s. Around a third of all 16- to 24-year-olds have taken an illegal drug, with young men more likely to indulge (36%) than young women (24%). The most commonly used drug is cannabis, followed by amphetamines and ecstasy. Cocaine use is much lower than in older age groups, where drug use as a whole is less prevalent. Women are more sexually active than men of the same age, with 37% of 16- to 19-year-olds having one sexual partner in the past year, compared with 24% of men, and 33% having more than two, compared with 28%. Educationally girls perform better than their male counterparts. In 1998-99 54% of girls achieved five or more GCSE grades A to C or equivalent, compared with 44% of boys. At A-level, 25% of girls have two A levels or more, 4% more than boys. More people than ever stay in full-time education and for longer, with 2.4m people - around a third - staying on beyond the minimum age of 16. Young men earn more than young women in full and part-time employment, although the gender discrepancy increases in the above-25 age group. Average weekly wages for 18- to 20-year-old women are around \u00a320 less than for young men. Unemployment rates are high, with 19% of young men not in education out of work, and 29% of young women. Nearly 21% of victims of violent crimes are young men, while 35% of all offenders are men aged between 16 and 20. While 33% of those eligible supported Labour at the last election, nearly a third did not bother to vote.",

This in turn has brought about a new democratic climate far removed from formal election processes with no real participation by ordinary people. In a special contribution to the report, the Nigerian president, Olesegun Obasanjo, writes of the \"evil governance\" experienced by his country before its return to civil government. \"The dark years spawned human rights activism . . . the more tyrannical the regime got, the more people became aware of what they were losing by way of freedom of expression and the right to determine how they were to be governed.\" These changes, Dr Jolly says, are underpinned by the large number of countries ratifying the various UN conventions on human rights. The convention on the rights of the child, for instance, has been ratified by every country except two: the US and Somalia. And countries such as Norway, Belgium, Sweden, Brazil, South Africa and Sri Lanka have adopted special budgets for matters relating to children. But these steps forward are against the background of some grim realities for children in other areas. For instance, Dr Jolly says, \"HIV/Aids is the disaster factor for a dozen or more countries in Africa, pulling down their life expectancy and their ranking in the human development index. Meanwhile life expectancy at the top end is going up\". The cost of war Botswana, which has enjoyed rapid growth in recent years, has income per capita on a par with Russia and Brazil, but its life expectancy has fallen by around 10 years as a result of the spread of HIV/Aids to more than 25% of the population. Although the number of conflicts fell during the 90s, the cost to the international community of the seven main wars (not including Kosovo) was $200bn - four times the development aid in any one year. \"Not too surprising then that the volume of development aid went down substantially in the 1990s.

      "body": "<p>Euro 2000 lost its rag in the King Baudouin stadium here last night. The first of the semi-finals ended in acriminious controversy after France beat Portugal in sudden-death extra-time with a penalty from Zinedine Zidane awarded on the say-so of a Slovakian linesman. </p> <p>With the match six minutes away from a penalty shootout Igor Sramka drew the Austrian referee G\u00fcnter Benko's attention to what he saw as a handball by Abel Xavier, Portugal's Everton right-back, who appeared to drop his left hand to intercept a narrow-angle shot from Sylvain Wiltord by the near post. </p> <p>Play was delayed by at least three minutes as Portugal, their players and bench, raged at Benk\u00f6 and Sramka. Luis Figo appeared to have left the scene in disgust, taking off his shirt, but returned seconds before Zidane drove the ball into the roof of the net and France to Rotterdam on Sunday. </p> <p>The rumpus continued as the players left the pitch. The referee gave Nuno Gomes a red card and Paulo Bento had to be restrained from confronting Sramka. Eusebio, Portugal's most famous footballer, vainly tried to calm everyone down, and in the immediate aftermath Humberto Coelho, Portugal's coach, resigned. A not entirely relevant gesture; Coelho merely said he considered it a good moment to go. </p> <p>Portugal were entitled to feel unlucky since they had dominated the first half after Nuno Gomes had given them the lead and withstood a strong French recovery once Thierry Henry had brought the scores level early in the second. But their subsequent outburst was disgraceful, whatever the justice of the penalty. </p> <p>At the same time it was a sad way for any team in this European Championship to die suddenly, least of all the positive, pleasing Portuguese. </p> <p>For a time last night it really did seem that Figo would upstage Zidane. At the very least Portugal could congratulate themselves on forcing the languid Frenchman to move as quickly as he thinks. Some of Zidane's footwork in the second half was exceptional even by his awesome standards. </p> <p>Yet France never quite managed to achieve the momentum that had driven them to the last four. Their coach Roger Lemerre left out Youri Djorkaeff to pair Nicolas Anelka and Henry up front and although they eventually conspired to produce a French goal the ploy rarely worked. </p> <p>Coelho's plan was simple enough: withdraw people behind the ball, use Costinha and Jose Luis Vidigal to close down French ambitions and hope that Figo and Manuel Rui Costa would link up with Nuno Gomes on the break. </p> <p>Initially Portugal did little more than watch and wait, but in the 18th minute it became clear what they were waiting for. Sergio Conceicao dispossessed a sluggish Deschamps and made a run across the face of the defence before setting up Nuno Gomes for a left-foot shot past Fabien Barthez. </p> <p>Portugal's football grew in confidence, reacquiring the casual flicks, nudges and backheels that have been their trademarks in Euro 2000. Figo was starting to run the game and France's defenders froze whenever he threatened to run at them. Much of this changed after half-time, mainly because Zidane was playing further forward and within five minutes a touch of pace from Anelka helped level the scores.

      "bodyText": "Euro 2000 lost its rag in the King Baudouin stadium here last night. The first of the semi-finals ended in acriminious controversy after France beat Portugal in sudden-death extra-time with a penalty from Zinedine Zidane awarded on the say-so of a Slovakian linesman. With the match six minutes away from a penalty shootout Igor Sramka drew the Austrian referee G\u00fcnter Benko's attention to what he saw as a handball by Abel Xavier, Portugal's Everton right-back, who appeared to drop his left hand to intercept a narrow-angle shot from Sylvain Wiltord by the near post. Play was delayed by at least three minutes as Portugal, their players and bench, raged at Benk\u00f6 and Sramka. Luis Figo appeared to have left the scene in disgust, taking off his shirt, but returned seconds before Zidane drove the ball into the roof of the net and France to Rotterdam on Sunday. The rumpus continued as the players left the pitch. The referee gave Nuno Gomes a red card and Paulo Bento had to be restrained from confronting Sramka. Eusebio, Portugal's most famous footballer, vainly tried to calm everyone down, and in the immediate aftermath Humberto Coelho, Portugal's coach, resigned. A not entirely relevant gesture; Coelho merely said he considered it a good moment to go. Portugal were entitled to feel unlucky since they had dominated the first half after Nuno Gomes had given them the lead and withstood a strong French recovery once Thierry Henry had brought the scores level early in the second. But their subsequent outburst was disgraceful, whatever the justice of the penalty. At the same time it was a sad way for any team in this European Championship to die suddenly, least of all the positive, pleasing Portuguese. For a time last night it really did seem that Figo would upstage Zidane. At the very least Portugal could congratulate themselves on forcing the languid Frenchman to move as quickly as he thinks. Some of Zidane's footwork in the second half was exceptional even by his awesome standards. Yet France never quite managed to achieve the momentum that had driven them to the last four. Their coach Roger Lemerre left out Youri Djorkaeff to pair Nicolas Anelka and Henry up front and although they eventually conspired to produce a French goal the ploy rarely worked. Coelho's plan was simple enough: withdraw people behind the ball, use Costinha and Jose Luis Vidigal to close down French ambitions and hope that Figo and Manuel Rui Costa would link up with Nuno Gomes on the break. Initially Portugal did little more than watch and wait, but in the 18th minute it became clear what they were waiting for. Sergio Conceicao dispossessed a sluggish Deschamps and made a run across the face of the defence before setting up Nuno Gomes for a left-foot shot past Fabien Barthez. Portugal's football grew in confidence, reacquiring the casual flicks, nudges and backheels that have been their trademarks in Euro 2000. Figo was starting to run the game and France's defenders froze whenever he threatened to run at them. Much of this changed after half-time, mainly because Zidane was playing further forward and within five minutes a touch of pace from Anelka helped level the scores. Looking offside, Anelka beat Vidigal to a pass from Lilian Thuram and switched the ball across to Henry, who shot into the far corner of the net. After that a semi-final which had lived up to its promise only in patches steadily fragmented. Yet Abel Xavier so nearly won it for Portugal in the 90th minute when he met a free-kick from Figo with a header which Barthez just managed to touch over the bar. In the end it was Abel Xavier who lost it. What a pity David Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet had not made the contact, from Wiltord's pass, which might have ended the game with a goal that brooked no argument.

The report mentioned the case of an American teacher on a school trip to London who was drugged and raped, and an 86-year-old widow from Cardiff attacked on her doorstep and left with a fractured skull. But a British Tourist Authority spokesman said the report conveyed a worrying misconception.\"Britain has always been seen as a civilised, multicultural society with relatively low levels of crime,\" a spokesman said. \"It is perfectly possible to have a safe and enjoyable vacation here. The main crime against visitors to London is petty theft.\" Last year 3.9m US visitors came to Britain and this figure is expected to top 4m this year, making the UK America's favourite European tourist destination. In 1998 the 2.6m Americans who visited London spent \u00a31.4bn. The CBS figures came from a 1998 survey for the US Department of Justice, based on figures for 1995, that showed that the rates of murder and rape were much less in England and Wales than in the US, but also showed that the chances of being a victim of robbery, assault, burglary and car theft were higher. These results confirmed the findings of previous surveys taken throughout the 1990s. The findings appear dramatic because of the Hollywood myth that US crime rates are the highest in the world.

The Home Office minister Charles Clarke said the report was ridiculous and underlined a \"serious tendency to trivialise an important issue\".

The defiance of the Cuban exiles earlier this year in the face of justice department orders to hand Elian over to his father, provoked a backlash in US public opinion which partly fuelled support for a bill agreed earlier this week in Congress to relax sanctions on the island. The bill would remove 40 years of sanctions on the sale of food and medicines to Cuba, though the effect of this could be entirely symbolic.",

      "body": "<p>British software developer Orchestream Holdings yesterday defied negative investor sentiment towards internet companies by showing a 74% price jump on its stock market debut. </p> <p>The stock reached a high of 322p shortly after listing, capitalising the group at \u00a3372m. Shares in Orchestream ended at 313.5p, compared with its issue price of 185p. </p> <p>The surge in share price reflected strong demand for the stock, which saw its public offer nine times oversubscribed. The success of Orchestream ranks alongside that of fibre-optics maker Bookham Technology, which listed in April. </p> <p>Both stocks have proved that wary investors are more willing to a pay a high price for shares in \"infrastructure\" style stocks that support the internet, telecommunications and personal computer markets rather than investing in e-commerce companies. </p> <p>Orchestream has developed a piece of software that is designed to ensure the reliable transmission of data along computer companies' networks and the internet, using the basic internet protocol (IP) technology that allows computers to communicate with each other over the net. </p> <p>Orchestream's software also allows the prioritising of data over the internet. The explosion in traffic has meant that IP transmissions have become errati c and slow, giving the software an edge over rivals. </p> <p>Orchestream raised \u00a349m through the issue of shares to institutions, which will own 37% of the company. Those funds will be used to expand the company's research and development and sales and marketing teams. Acquisitions and strategic alliances might also be considered. </p> <p>Ashley Ward, Orchestream's chief executive, said: \"It's important that we begin to widen the gap between us and any competitor that might emerge in this market.\" </p> <p>He believes Orchestream has a 12-month lead on its competitors. </p> <p>The competitive threat to Orchestream is expected to emerge from industry heavyweights such as Cisco, Lucent and Nortel.

      "bodyText": "British software developer Orchestream Holdings yesterday defied negative investor sentiment towards internet companies by showing a 74% price jump on its stock market debut. The stock reached a high of 322p shortly after listing, capitalising the group at \u00a3372m. Shares in Orchestream ended at 313.5p, compared with its issue price of 185p. The surge in share price reflected strong demand for the stock, which saw its public offer nine times oversubscribed. The success of Orchestream ranks alongside that of fibre-optics maker Bookham Technology, which listed in April. Both stocks have proved that wary investors are more willing to a pay a high price for shares in \"infrastructure\" style stocks that support the internet, telecommunications and personal computer markets rather than investing in e-commerce companies. Orchestream has developed a piece of software that is designed to ensure the reliable transmission of data along computer companies' networks and the internet, using the basic internet protocol (IP) technology that allows computers to communicate with each other over the net. Orchestream's software also allows the prioritising of data over the internet. The explosion in traffic has meant that IP transmissions have become errati c and slow, giving the software an edge over rivals. Orchestream raised \u00a349m through the issue of shares to institutions, which will own 37% of the company. Those funds will be used to expand the company's research and development and sales and marketing teams. Acquisitions and strategic alliances might also be considered. Ashley Ward, Orchestream's chief executive, said: \"It's important that we begin to widen the gap between us and any competitor that might emerge in this market.\" He believes Orchestream has a 12-month lead on its competitors. The competitive threat to Orchestream is expected to emerge from industry heavyweights such as Cisco, Lucent and Nortel. They are expected to develop their own software and could then use their marketing muscle to ease the likes of Orchestream to one side. Mr Ward said he was \"pleasantly surprised\" at the company's strong listing. Orchestream had incurred a loss of \u00a32.6m at April 30, on revenues of \u00a3411,000. Analysts expect its losses to leap to \u00a310m on sales of \u00a32.7m this year and turn to profit in 2002. The remainder of the company's share register will be split between management, owning 21% of the stock, chip maker Intel and Reuters holding 6%, and venture capital firms such as Atlas, Quester and Celtic House.

Radio signals take whole minutes to arrive from the Red Planet, so Mr Hague was left waffling about the government \"banning musical chairs, getting the royal family to move house and counting up fat people on TV\". By next week the Martians will have worked out how to respond to the new Blair confessional strategy (\"Yes, yes, I admit, we got it all wrong - wrong, I tell you... \") and we shall hear the results.",

      "body": "<p> I am hoping to have a designer baby. Any offspring of mine will not be God's gift: I fully intend to exploit the latest medical advances to ensure my child is as perfect as possible. This involves selecting some embryos and eliminating others. He or she will be chosen according to how good their genes are. </p> <p>This week's announcement of the near-complete sequencing of the human genome will undoubtedly make this selection procedure easier and more widely available. For, despite Bill Clinton's claim that \"our children's children will know the term cancer only as a constellation of stars\", human genetic engineering is not, in the short term at least, about preventing and curing disease. It's about whom we want to be born. This is a decision some parents have had to make already. It will increasingly be a decision that other people are going to make about us. </p> <p>I am, in the new language we will quickly develop, \"genetically disadvantaged\". There is nothing overtly wrong with me, as is the case with most of those who carry a genetic condition. My only difficulty is when I try to reproduce. </p> <p>I have a condition called a balanced translocation: two fragments have broken off from two of my chromosomes and swapped places, balancing each other out. This has no implications for my health. But a child could inherit these chromosomes in an unbalanced form, resulting in such a major disability that miscarriage is likely. Occasionally, a pregnancy may go to full term and a baby be born with severe, probably fatal, physical and mental difficulties. </p> <p>There is no cure for chromosomal translocations and, despite the Human Genome Project, no prospect of a cure. But where genetic advances can help is by sorting good embryos from bad. By undergoing IVF treatment, tests can be made on the eight-cell embryos to determine if they have a chromosomal translocation. This process is called preimplantantion genetic diagnosis (PGD). Very few babies have been born through PGD, less than 20 in the UK. Just a handful of \"live births\" have resulted from PGD for chromosomal translocations. This is the reality of creating a designer baby. </p> <p>At the assisted conception unit I attend, there are couples who carry, among other inherited disorders, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and cystic fibrosis genes. The emphasis and implication for diseases such as these is not - as we have been led to believe in the furore surrounding the Human Genome Project - on the search for a cure, on somehow replacing good genes with bad (though no one knows quite how yet). The emphasis here is to eliminate those who are affected, to make it so there are simply no people with SMA or cystic fibrosis; any embryos carrying these conditions are killed at just a few cells old. I use the word killed deliberately. We shouldn't flinch from it. This is also precisely what I intend to do - kill embryos I don't want to be born. Embryos are fledgling human beings. It is genomicide. </p> <p>This is not destruction by mere whim. My choices, as those of the other \"genetically disadvantaged\", are not the same as the vast majority of the reproductive population. I either make this genetic selection, or risk further multiple miscarriages and accept infertility. I would prefer not to have to. No one in her right mind would opt for the procedure of PGD instead of what is quaintly called \"the old fashioned method\". </p> <p>There are strict limits placed upon the genetic selection procedure. Each new PGD test must be licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). It forbids tests for \"social or psychological characteristics\" or \"normal physical variations\", such as sex or long legs. </p> <p>Only those conditions associated with disability or serious medical conditions are permitted. But there are other considerations which those undertaking and licensing tests take into account. While my eight-cell embryos are in the dishes being assessed for chromosomal translocation, they cannot also be tested for Down's syndrome. Not one of the centres currently offering PGD in Britain has yet dared to apply to the HFEA for permission to carry out such a test. The elimination of Down's syndrome - unlike chromosomal translocation - has political implications. The issues here are complex, and there are lobby groups and disability movements to deal with. Elsewhere in Europe, such a Down's test for PGD patients would be commonplace. </p> <p>It would make sense, and be perfectly possible, for the tests for both disorders to be done together. But ironically, while there is no licence for my hours-old embryos to be tested for Down's, if I proceed to pregnancy, testing is highly recommended. Due to my age (40) the medical advice will be to have diagnostic tests for Down's, either chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at 12 weeks into a pregnancy or amniocentesis at 18. Even more ironically in my case, both these tests carry a risk of miscarriage. </p> <p>But it's not only nonsensical to prevent testing at the test tube stage, it's absurd. Imagine if an embryo which had been picked out to be re-implanted in me proved 12 weeks later to have Down's. After two months of IVF treatment, involving huge personal effort and medical commitment, to have striven to create a life, I would almost certainly be advised to destroy it. </p> <p>I do not believe that having a child with Down's is a tragedy. The profound decisions women must make about continuing pregnancies with a risk of Down's are made in a climate heavily weighted in favour of termination. But I also believe that every woman should have the right to be tested how and when she wants. The practical, if unintentional, result of political pressures on testing is a system that condones late termination - abortion by any other name - yet precludes the relatively painless, and far less morally culpable, early prevention of a life. </p> <p>So in this brave new world of human genome sequencing, what should we test for, when and why? And why should we stop at weeding out those who are going to have manifest symptoms? It is one small scientific step from eliminating the affected to eliminating the carrier. If I didn't have a genetic condition that could be passed on, there would be no problem. Why not nip the chromosomal translocation in the bud? Why restrict testing to those who will be catastrophically affected by a chromosome disorder? Why not extend it to those like me who simply pass on such catastrophes? Why shouldn't I be eliminated? </p> <p>From where I'm lying - feet up in stirrups - this is not an abstract philosophical debate. Nor is it merely a matter of enabling people to benefit from medical advances. As with the choices being made about testing for Down's syndrome, these are not medical but political matters. It is up to us, with the knowledge given to us by the scientists, to decide. </p> <p>We must begin to vigorously debate the limits of acceptable genomicide. To pretend that the human genome is all about saving, rather than destroying, lives is to be blind to the brutal truth about our very human, flawed condition.</p>",

The men were arrested following a raid on a harbour-side warehouse in Rotterdam thought to have been used as a meeting point for the group of Chinese. An international arrest warrant was issued for another man wanted in connection with the incident. Sixty Chinese nationals boarded the lorry, registered to a Dutch firm, in Rotterdam before being driven to Zeebrugge in Belgium, where they took a ferry to Dover. Customs officers discovered the bodies and two survivors during a routine search. An inquest last week heard that they had suffocated, and that an air vent that might have saved their lives had been closed prior to the ferry crossing. Menngs Garretsen, a spokesman for the Dutch illegal human trafficking unit, said: \"All seven suspects will be charged with manslaughter and people smuggling on Friday. We arrested them at certain times between last Thursday and yesterday afternoon.\" The men, one of whom, is a 24-year-old owner of a transport company, are from Rotterdam, Vlaardingen and two are from Capelle ann de I'Ussel. Perry Wacker, 32, the lorry driver, was charged with 58 counts of manslaughter by Kent police last Friday. Two other people, both of Chinese origin, were also charged with conspiracy to smuggle illegal immigrants. You Yi, 38, a chef and 29-year-old female interpreter Ying Guo, both from South Woodford, east London, were remanded in custody. The three charged in the UK are due to reappear at Folkestone magistrates on Friday. Dutch detectives believe the Chinese group were brought to the warehouse at Waalhaven Zuidzijde in delivery vans. Matching traces of unspecified materials were found in the warehouse and the lorry that brought the 60 people to the UK. A spokesman for the Dutch authorities said yesterday's arrests represented \"remarkable progress\" in the inquiry. \"The Dutch police have managed to get a pretty clear picture of the organisation and of the individuals that have been organising the transport as well as the manner in which the suspects may have been involved,\" he said. \"In broad terms it appears that the organisation has rented a warehouse especially for the purpose of the smuggling operation and has a transport company registered in the name of a front man. \"After that an articulated truck and container have been purchased.

Or rather somebody did. Graff Diamonds told the high court in London yesterday that the matter had been settled \"amicably\" and that the full \u00a3426,000 bill for a diamond watch, bracelet and two pocket watches would be met in full by July 7. The case of the unpaid baubles was one of the key controversies surrounding Tyson's recent trip to Britain when he defeated Lou Savarese in 38 seconds at Hampden Park in Glasgow. He is alleged to have assaulted his promoter, Frank Warren, when he discovered that Mr Warren had not paid for the jewels, which he acquired during his last trip in January. But last night it was not clear who had picked up the tab. A spokesman for Mr Warren said the promoter was on his way to America and could not be contacted. Mr Warren, who sported a badly bloodshot eye at the Glasgow fight, has already said he will not promote Tyson in future. In court yesterday, a lawyer representing Graff Diamonds told Mr Justice Eady that the matter had been settled and the full price of the jewels would be paid next week. However, a separate action involving two other watches from the St Albans jewellers David Gillow, valued at a total of \u00a3185,000, is to continue. The judge heard that Mr Warren, Tyson and an entourage of six minders arrived at the shop in New Bond Street, London, on January 20 and the boxer asked managing director Laurence Graff to \"show me something\". From a tray of watches, Tyson selected a diamond watch with a sapphire dial for which he agreed to pay $200,000. The boxer then agreed to pay $250,000 for an emerald and diamond bracelet if it was altered to fit his wrist. When asked who was going to pay, Tyson said Warren would deal with it and the promoter agreed, according to papers before the court.

When Mr Warren rang the shop asking to collect the pocket watches, he agreed to pay the total $630,000 (\u00a3426,000) bill, the judge was told. Graff Diamonds took the pair to court after unsuccessfully asking for payment for more than five months. The second claim involved two watches lent to Mr Warren by David Gillow, the St Albans jeweller, to show Tyson during the same visit to Britain. The judge was told that the watches were now being held by a neutral party as security, together with \u00a3100,000 from Tyson, who \"hotly contested\" the claim. Andy Kerman, solicitor for Graff Diamonds, said after the hearing: \"Laurence Graff is delighted the matter has been resolved. He will be even more delighted when he gets his money.\"",

      "body": "<p>The row between BSkyB and ITV over the network's refusal to offer its channels to the satellite broadcaster's digital service intensified last night when it was claimed that viewing of ITV in Sky homes is falling to new lows. </p> <p>According to figures from audience researcher Barb, ITV's total viewing share in Sky Digital homes has slipped from 20.6% in March to 19.3% in June. The June figure was however a slight increase on the previous month. </p> <p>BSkyB forecast that the network's share of the peak-time national audience would fall to 37% by year end - 1.5% below the target presented to advertisers at the beginning of the year - because of its absence from Sky's digital service. </p> <p>ITV has so far resisted calls from BSkyB to take up a place on the satellite platform, arguing that the 27 different regions that the commercial terrestial network delivers programming to would make the cost of transmission too high. </p> <p>The two sides have been at loggerheads for the past year. </p> <p>A BSkyB spokesman said the viewing figures illustrated the \"irrationality\" of ITV staying off the satellite platform. \"How much more financial pain must ITV bear to try to generate an artificial advantage for Ondigital, its terrestrial pay TV service?

      "bodyText": "The row between BSkyB and ITV over the network's refusal to offer its channels to the satellite broadcaster's digital service intensified last night when it was claimed that viewing of ITV in Sky homes is falling to new lows. According to figures from audience researcher Barb, ITV's total viewing share in Sky Digital homes has slipped from 20.6% in March to 19.3% in June. The June figure was however a slight increase on the previous month. BSkyB forecast that the network's share of the peak-time national audience would fall to 37% by year end - 1.5% below the target presented to advertisers at the beginning of the year - because of its absence from Sky's digital service. ITV has so far resisted calls from BSkyB to take up a place on the satellite platform, arguing that the 27 different regions that the commercial terrestial network delivers programming to would make the cost of transmission too high. The two sides have been at loggerheads for the past year. A BSkyB spokesman said the viewing figures illustrated the \"irrationality\" of ITV staying off the satellite platform. \"How much more financial pain must ITV bear to try to generate an artificial advantage for Ondigital, its terrestrial pay TV service? And how long before advertisers start getting restless and ask difficult questions?\" he added. ITV and ITV2 can both be received by ONdigital, the platform owned by Granada and Carlton Communications. \"In terrestrial-only homes ITV are ahead of the peak-time target at 41% but well behind in 'Sky Digital homes' at 28.6%,\" the BSkyB spokesman added. \"Based on this level of performance and the growth in digital penetration to 5m homes by the end of the year we forecast a figure of 37% by the year end.\" An ITV spokeswoman described Sky's figures as \"disingenuous\" and said of all the free-to-air channels, ITV had lost the least number of viewers in Sky Digital homes. \"Everyone looses share in multi-channel homes because there is more choice. It's not because we are not on the platform,\" she said.",

The business which owns the Bates advertising agency network is a tier below the world's leading groups and the pace of consolidation in the industry means it cannot retain its independence for long, surely? That at least seemed to be the reasoning which led to reports yesterday that Cordiant has opened talks with at least two American suitors - True North Communications and Interpublic. Sources close to Cordiant suggested the rumours were easy conclusions to draw but otherwise wide of the mark. It was enough to prompt an 18.5p increase in Cordiant's share price to 383.5p. Market sentiment was guarded ahead of the decision on interest rates in the US - a mood which helped depress the FTSE 100 index 61.8 points lower to 6,313.5.

      "body": "<p>Yesterday's warning from the Bank of Ireland that the Irish economy is showing increasing signs of overheating will have brought a chorus of \"I told you so\" from around Europe. The most fundamental criticism of the European Central Bank's monetary policy is not that it has not done enough to stand up for the euro - though it hasn't - but that its \"one size fits all\" interest rate policy was and is flawed. </p> <p>It is hard to see how a single monetary policy regime could foster growth in a struggling German economy while at the same time harnessing the \"Celtic tiger\". </p> <p>The Bank of Ireland singled out the rate at which wages were rising as a particular concern. High costs could reverse the flow of inward investment. Headline inflation is likely to rise further even though the central bank, unlike some analysts, believes it may now be close to its peak. Bertie Ahern's government must be hoping so in the wake of this week's anti-inflation package - although freezing the price of booze is never going to be a vote-loser. </p> <p>But two points. First, the outlook for the Irish economy is not one to drive the Bank to drink - even at pre-freeze prices. It is forecasting 8.5% growth this year and at least 7% next. </p> <p>Second, responsibility for the risk of overheating cannot be laid entirely at the door of the ECB and an interest rate regime incapable of accommodating different growth rates in different economies. Monetary policy is not the only way of cooling economic growth. When governments round Europe handed over control of interest rates to central banks they were keen to hand the responsibility for unpopular decisions with it. But they cannot be allowed to escape so easily. Higher taxes can get the job done, too. </p> <p>Unfortunately for Ireland, neither the ECB n or the government is reaching for the brakes. All the Bank of Ireland can do is sound the horn. </p> <p><strong> Return post </strong><br> To those with memories going back to 1968, yesterday's move by the government to set up a \"universal bank\" in post offices may have evoked a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. </p> <p>Then, another Labour government was setting up what was to become Girobank with an aim of making banking facilities available to all. Girobank was eventually sold off by a Conservative government and has been owned by Alliance &amp; Leicester since 1990. </p> <p>This time the \"universal bank\" is being billed as the salvation of the ailing post office network at a time when the government wants to pay social security benefits directly into bank accounts. </p> <p>Little wonder that Richard Banks, managing director of Girobank, admitted yesterday that recreating a post office-based bank, 30 years on, was \"rather amazing\". While supportive of any plan which keeps the post office network alive - still the life blood of Girobank's business - Mr Banks has a question or two to pose. </p> <p>Who will be responsible for the new cards, handed out to social security recipients, which go astray and are used fraudulently? At present, the benefits agency decides whether cheques can be reclaimed.

      "bodyText": "Yesterday's warning from the Bank of Ireland that the Irish economy is showing increasing signs of overheating will have brought a chorus of \"I told you so\" from around Europe. The most fundamental criticism of the European Central Bank's monetary policy is not that it has not done enough to stand up for the euro - though it hasn't - but that its \"one size fits all\" interest rate policy was and is flawed. It is hard to see how a single monetary policy regime could foster growth in a struggling German economy while at the same time harnessing the \"Celtic tiger\". The Bank of Ireland singled out the rate at which wages were rising as a particular concern. High costs could reverse the flow of inward investment. Headline inflation is likely to rise further even though the central bank, unlike some analysts, believes it may now be close to its peak. Bertie Ahern's government must be hoping so in the wake of this week's anti-inflation package - although freezing the price of booze is never going to be a vote-loser. But two points. First, the outlook for the Irish economy is not one to drive the Bank to drink - even at pre-freeze prices. It is forecasting 8.5% growth this year and at least 7% next. Second, responsibility for the risk of overheating cannot be laid entirely at the door of the ECB and an interest rate regime incapable of accommodating different growth rates in different economies. Monetary policy is not the only way of cooling economic growth. When governments round Europe handed over control of interest rates to central banks they were keen to hand the responsibility for unpopular decisions with it. But they cannot be allowed to escape so easily. Higher taxes can get the job done, too. Unfortunately for Ireland, neither the ECB n or the government is reaching for the brakes. All the Bank of Ireland can do is sound the horn. Return post To those with memories going back to 1968, yesterday's move by the government to set up a \"universal bank\" in post offices may have evoked a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Then, another Labour government was setting up what was to become Girobank with an aim of making banking facilities available to all. Girobank was eventually sold off by a Conservative government and has been owned by Alliance &amp; Leicester since 1990. This time the \"universal bank\" is being billed as the salvation of the ailing post office network at a time when the government wants to pay social security benefits directly into bank accounts. Little wonder that Richard Banks, managing director of Girobank, admitted yesterday that recreating a post office-based bank, 30 years on, was \"rather amazing\". While supportive of any plan which keeps the post office network alive - still the life blood of Girobank's business - Mr Banks has a question or two to pose. Who will be responsible for the new cards, handed out to social security recipients, which go astray and are used fraudulently? At present, the benefits agency decides whether cheques can be reclaimed. What will the \"universal bank\" do? Another issue is the level of reassurance the banks will be offered by government that any commitment they make will not leave them with hefty bills as a result of any change in policy by future admini strations. Despite the bashing the banks have received in recent months, they may be less than enthusiastic about rushing in to help the universal bank. Monti muscle Mario Monti's decision to block the WorldCom/Sprint merger will add to those who believe the European commission's competition commissioner is cultivating a tough guy image. He is already investigating America Online/Time Warner and Warner Music/EMI. The more pertinent question, however, is whether he is an empire builder. There are two strands to Mr Monti's approach. Yesterday's decision shows the good working relationship between the EU's competition watchdog and its opposite number in the US. No harm in that.

      "body": "<p>Few people can hope to take on the world's biggest companies and win. Mario Monti, the EU competition commissioner, can - and does. The Italian yesterday flexed his considerable muscle and blocked the proposed merger between the US phone companies WorldCom and Sprint even though the two firms had already told Brussels they were withdrawing their merger notification. </p> <p>The decision was technical in the face of Tuesday's ban by the US justice department. But it was the first time the European commission had blocked a merger between two non-EU companies. \"The commission has decided to prohibit the merger as it would have created a company with a dominant position in the market for global internet backbone service,\" Mr Monti said. </p> <p>If recent evidence is anything to go by, mergers involving internet companies will continue attracting Mr Monti's gaze. Besides blocking the WorldCom/Sprint deal, he has in the past month opened anti-monopoly inquiries into America Online's merger with Time Warner and Warner Music's joint venture with EMI of Britain. </p> <p><strong> 'Avoiding bottlenecks'</strong><br> </p> <p> \"Competition policy has a key role to play in the light of the 'new economy' to preserve the incentive to innovate by avoiding bottlenecks and similar anti-competitive developments,\" Mr Monti said. Brushing aside suggestions the EU's action was not required, he said it was necessary to make a formal decision to reject the proposed \u00a376bn merger because the companies did not say they were cancelling their agreement - only that they did not intend to implement it. </p> <p>EU anti-competition rules can take into account the effect of a merger on the European market. The move underlines the increasingly global nature of business, and especially telecoms. \"It is not the nationality of the companies or where they are based, but the sales they have in the EU,\" a commission official said. </p> <p>The EU examined the merger in parallel with the US justice department, which filed suit on Tuesday to block the deal, saying it would increase prices for millions of consumers. The actions of the regulators highlighted how the American authorities often have to speed up their investigations to dovetail with the rigidly timetabled EU system. </p> <p>Under EU rules, the commission has an initial four weeks to review a deal. At that point, it can either clear it or refer it for a further four months of scrutiny. In the US there is no deadline, making co-ordination difficult. </p> <p>It was the 13th time the commission has blocked a merger since 1990, when EU member states gave it the power to review all mergers and acquisitions involving companies with combined global sales in excess of \u20ac5bn (\u00a33.1bn) and EU sales of at least \u20ac250m for each, irrespective of their nationality. </p> <p>Sprint's offer to divest its internet business was \"insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the merger,\" the commission said. </p> <p>Had WorldCom and Sprint merged the new company would have become the third biggest telecoms group in the world - worth more than $133bn (\u00a388bn) - and carried 45% of the globe's internet traffic. </p> <p>The deal, said the commission, would \"dictate conditions and prices in the market to the detriment of consumers around the world and particularly in the 15 EU states\". </p> <p>Now the two firms face three choices, none of them particularly palatable. With regulators on both sides of the Atlantic against them, the two can either walk away from the deal, go to court to argue their case or offer to radically restructure the merger. </p> <p>Wall Street analysts believe that a decision to pursue the merger through the US courts is the least likely option, particularly after the commission's decision to block the deal. </p> <p>But without significant guidance from either company, most traders were divided about what could happen next. There is talk that WorldCom could sell its low-margin consumer long-distance business or that the acquisitive company could itself become a takeover target. And analysts believe that several non-US groups - including Deutsche Telekom or NTT - could be interested in bidding for either group. </p> <p>Bernard Ebbers, who built WorldCom through a series of acquisitions, was not commenting on yesterday's decision.

      "bodyText": "Few people can hope to take on the world's biggest companies and win. Mario Monti, the EU competition commissioner, can - and does. The Italian yesterday flexed his considerable muscle and blocked the proposed merger between the US phone companies WorldCom and Sprint even though the two firms had already told Brussels they were withdrawing their merger notification. The decision was technical in the face of Tuesday's ban by the US justice department. But it was the first time the European commission had blocked a merger between two non-EU companies. \"The commission has decided to prohibit the merger as it would have created a company with a dominant position in the market for global internet backbone service,\" Mr Monti said. If recent evidence is anything to go by, mergers involving internet companies will continue attracting Mr Monti's gaze. Besides blocking the WorldCom/Sprint deal, he has in the past month opened anti-monopoly inquiries into America Online's merger with Time Warner and Warner Music's joint venture with EMI of Britain. 'Avoiding bottlenecks' \"Competition policy has a key role to play in the light of the 'new economy' to preserve the incentive to innovate by avoiding bottlenecks and similar anti-competitive developments,\" Mr Monti said. Brushing aside suggestions the EU's action was not required, he said it was necessary to make a formal decision to reject the proposed \u00a376bn merger because the companies did not say they were cancelling their agreement - only that they did not intend to implement it. EU anti-competition rules can take into account the effect of a merger on the European market. The move underlines the increasingly global nature of business, and especially telecoms. \"It is not the nationality of the companies or where they are based, but the sales they have in the EU,\" a commission official said. The EU examined the merger in parallel with the US justice department, which filed suit on Tuesday to block the deal, saying it would increase prices for millions of consumers. The actions of the regulators highlighted how the American authorities often have to speed up their investigations to dovetail with the rigidly timetabled EU system. Under EU rules, the commission has an initial four weeks to review a deal. At that point, it can either clear it or refer it for a further four months of scrutiny. In the US there is no deadline, making co-ordination difficult. It was the 13th time the commission has blocked a merger since 1990, when EU member states gave it the power to review all mergers and acquisitions involving companies with combined global sales in excess of \u20ac5bn (\u00a33.1bn) and EU sales of at least \u20ac250m for each, irrespective of their nationality. Sprint's offer to divest its internet business was \"insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the merger,\" the commission said. Had WorldCom and Sprint merged the new company would have become the third biggest telecoms group in the world - worth more than $133bn (\u00a388bn) - and carried 45% of the globe's internet traffic. The deal, said the commission, would \"dictate conditions and prices in the market to the detriment of consumers around the world and particularly in the 15 EU states\". Now the two firms face three choices, none of them particularly palatable. With regulators on both sides of the Atlantic against them, the two can either walk away from the deal, go to court to argue their case or offer to radically restructure the merger. Wall Street analysts believe that a decision to pursue the merger through the US courts is the least likely option, particularly after the commission's decision to block the deal. But without significant guidance from either company, most traders were divided about what could happen next. There is talk that WorldCom could sell its low-margin consumer long-distance business or that the acquisitive company could itself become a takeover target. And analysts believe that several non-US groups - including Deutsche Telekom or NTT - could be interested in bidding for either group. Bernard Ebbers, who built WorldCom through a series of acquisitions, was not commenting on yesterday's decision. He prompted the regulatory inquiry into the Sprint deal months after announcing the acquisition of MCI a year ago. Limited options Courtney Munroe, a telecoms director at research group International Data, said the chances of WorldCom scrapping the deal or offering to sell its long-distance business were about 50-50. \"I don't believe that the deal is dead yet. I still think there's hope.\" WorldCom's options were severely limited by the EU's decision to block the deal. The company does not want to sell off UUNet, its internet backbone business. And Sprint has made clear that it finds EU demands to spin off a significant part of its long-distance business unacceptable.

The precise sum will be made public at the spending review announcement next month, covering 2002-5. The industry secretary, Stephen Byers, yesterday claimed the money, coupled with new commercial opportunities, would help to prevent \"avoidable closures\" of rural post offices. But Mr Byers gave little detailed definition of this reassurance, prompting Conservative claims he had still not guaranteed the safety of Britain's unprofitable post offices. The government has also been warned that as many as 1,000 post offices could close over the next three years before new commercial opportunities come on stream. Mr Byers made his announcements as he published a Cabinet Office report claiming the Post Office must diversify from its traditional core business if it is to survive. Admitting the Post Office had been slow to modernise, Mr Byers mapped out three new commercial opportunities including e-commerce, one-stop shops for government information and a new post office-based Universal Bank for the 3m, mainly poor, who have no bank accounts. The Post Office could also make agreements to act as agent for commercial banks who have deserted rural communities and the inner cities. Mr Byers also reassured pensioner groups, saying pensions will still be available in cash at post offices. The post office network, already losing 400 offices a year, is on the verge of a crisis engendered by the government decision to switch to automated credit transfer (ACT) for the payment of benefits. The Post Office will lose \u00a3400m by 2005 when ACT will have been completed. Currently, the payment of social security benefits accounts for 35% of its income. But figures published yesterday show nearly half the post office network already generates less income than it costs. In total these offices lose around \u00a335-40m, mainly in rural areas. But the Cabinet Office report claims the 18,000-strong network, the largest retail network in Britain, is a sleeping giant with 28m customers making 45m visits every week. Far more income could be engendered from these visits. Attention focused yesterday on Mr Byers' promise that the government will put in place a formal duty to prevent any avoidable closures. He defined an unavoidable closure as one in which \"no one is prepared to take over from a departing sub-postmaster or where an associated retail business in the post office is no longer commercially viable\". The new duty, expected to last six years, will apply to rural post offices serving settlements of 10,000 or fewer people. The pledge would at present cover 10,000 post offices. Mr Byers also promised a fund to modernise run-down post offices in deprived areas. Plans for the proposed Universal Bank will be finalised by Christmas, but the bank will not offer an overdraft facility. Mr Byers claimed the rural network could, eventually, \"form the backbone of communication between government and citizens\" and serve as the rural base for the internet. 'If it is going to keep us open, we have got to be more than willing to cooperate' Dispensing advice and information, and providing a banking service to those without a bank account, hold no fears for Regan Jones and her mother, Susan Fellows, who run the post office and shop in Bwlch in the Brecon Beacons. The office is the focal point of a community where almost three-quarters of the village's 1,000 residents are elderly, and barely a day goes by without someone calling in for advice. \"This would be a lot of new information to take in, but if it is going to keep the post office open we have got to be more than willing to cooperate,\" said Ms Jones, who became a postmistress at the age of 21 when the family took over the business four years ago. \"We have not got many buses here, so people rely on the post office. If it were to close, what would happen to village life? Everybody comes in to find out what is going on, and we are already like a tourist information service.\" The two women have worked hard to build up the once rundown operation. They run a grocery delivery service, make sandwiches for the passing tourist trade, and have begun to take in laundry. Like other rural post office owners, they are worried about the imminent loss of the contract to pay pensions and benefits. Given Bwlch's age profile, pensions form an important part of their work. Not only would the loss of this and other benefit payments cut their post office turnover by about a third, it could, they fear, have a knock on effect on sales in the shop. They hope the government's plans for a Universal Bank to be run through the post office network will provide the boost the rural post offices so badly need. \"It should really help people in rural areas like this, where there are probably a lot of people without bank accounts,\" said Ms Jones. Steve Like, who runs the post office in nearby Hay on Wye and represents 260 sub postmasters and mistresses in Hereford and central Wales, said the universal banking proposal would send a much needed lifeline to rural offices. Eighteen communities in the region have lost their offices over the last two years, and he feared that a quarter of those that remained could be vulnerable if there was no work to replace the threatened loss of pensions and benefits. He felt the banking proposals would gain widespread approval in rural areas where many people like to deal in cash and have a fear of banks.",

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair has been wrestling with religion since he was an Oxford undergraduate. It's an intensely personal engagement, and seems never to have stopped. Among prime ministers, only Arthur Balfour, and before him Gladstone, have apparently taken such a consuming interest in the ultimate purpose of life on earth, which certainly is not politics. Such questing passion distinguishes Mr Blair from contemporary politicians too, not least William Hague. Mr Hague is in the middle of his own calculated jousting with religion, but his approach could hardly be more different.</p> <p>In his spiritual fascinations, Mr Blair is regarded by some people, including several in his own cabinet, as a bit of a weirdo. Some of the things he does indeed seem strange. Tomorrow, after an evening in Berlin straightening out Gerhard Schr\u00f6der over Europe, a necessary public job, he will move to Tubingen to talk with Hans Kung, the priest-theologian long delicensed by the Vatican, and give a speech at Kung's Global Ethics Foundation. This he need not do. There are no votes in it. The speech he makes will reflect an entirely personal interest in the same kinds of exploration, into values and ethics and community, which Kung has conducted as an intellectual colonist reaching out far beyond his base in Old Catholicism.</p> <p>What Kung and Blair share is, among other things, a concern about the role of public men. Blair is on a journey towards truth but also on a search for validation. Kung might give it to him. A leader of formidable certainty at one level, Blair needs definition at another. He wants to speak, but he also wants to know. Much of his life has been spent listening to gurus who might make him wiser, better or more successful. Though his political machine has raised manipulative cynicism to new heights, his personal desire is for the linkage of his life with goals that will pass muster at the last judgment.</p> <p>So it did not strike him as odd - as even the philosopher Balfour might have found it - to spend his summer holiday reading the Koran and the history of Islam. There was no public reason to do that. Britain no longer has much to do in the Middle East and if we did, Foreign Office Arabists could supply the necessary precis in a trice. Maybe the reading was a prelude to Turkey's admission to the concert of Europe, which Blair importantly supported earlier this year, moving on from a definition of Europe, often voiced by Helmut Kohl, that confined it within the boundaries of Christendom. Essentially, though, this was part of Blair's pilgrimage in search of universal values.</p> <p>It was a fulfilment, Kung-like, of the ultimate ecumenicism, wherein all religions have their points. Like religion, like politics. The Blair view of politics is that there are the Tories - and then there is everyone else, crowding into the same big tent. Likewise, there are believers: Christian, Hindu, Muslim, others, who scarcely need to be differentiated. And then there are atheists, infidels beyond the gates, deprived not just of the blessing of belief but of meaningful guidance as to the best way forward in the public realm.</p> <p>The big point is that this is personal. It's not an electoral or political construct. Blair plans to give another \"values\" address to the evangelical Faith in the Future conference in Brighton next month. He does want to broaden the political audience. But there is no tokenism here. He never actually mentions God. The most serious believer among prime ministers for many decades eschews, in public, the source of the doctrine he believes in. He thereby shows good taste, and basic political discretion. But you can see a multi-headed god, or God, edging him forward, gnawing at him.</p> <p>William Hague, on the other hand, has decided Christians are a political niche-market. This is a new discovery for him, and it's narrowly faith-bound. He has taken to mentioning Christianity, if not God, a lot. But his personal stance has no pedigree, and his interest is functional. He's a conventional politician, there to tell and never to learn. \"Roll up your sleeves and get involved,\" he instructed 10,000 evangelicals at the Spring Harvest festival. \"The church is very much alive and advancing in many parts of this land\", he shamelessly preached, playing the audience like segmented voters. On the one hand, \"Jesus called us to serve the lonely as well as the hungry\" and similar pieties, on the other a series of claims that the Tories alone stand for marriage, the family and traditional British values of the kind that godly evangelicals believe in.</p> <p>Palpably, Hague's only quest is for votes. He is not searching for purpose, which needs no further definition than a Tory victory. The message, like the technique, is American, trailing hopefully in the wake of George W. Bush and his oxymoronic \"compassionate conservatism\". Last week the Tories summoned Bush's own guru, Marvin Olasky, who delivered a message of such born-again intolerance and exclusivity that even Hague's people got worried: \"God is a capitalist and free marketeer\", \"the evil of homosexuality\", mothers should not work, women should not run for president, Olasky said. Aligning religious fundamentalism with core Tory positions may make the heartland vote feel better. Otherwise Hague's flirtation with faith-politics is already looking like opportunism gone wrong.</p> <p>I think neither of these excursions away from the regular political agenda is likely to get far. The Hague approach treats Britain as if she were, or might become, America. The chances of that happening are as low as those of private charity here supplanting great tracts of public provision. Faith-politics works to some extent in the US, because many more Americans than British say they believe in a Christian God. For better or worse, God enters the political dialogue without embarrassment. Faith-based social programmes have reality because there are enough believers to carry them out. A Tory leader, whose own belief shows no sign of rising above the routine mouthings of generations of leaders before him, cannot be seen as anything other than a cynical dabbler in a market-place where honest trade is slow to non-existent.</p> <p>The Blair approach to faith has the virtue of originality. Doctrine doesn't matter much nor, even, does allegiance. What matters is the search for some kind of transcendental purpose, a quest that bothers the leader as much as it's meant to inspire the led. Mr Blair's visit to talk again with Hans Kung is the gratuitous act of a decently troubled man. If it were calculated, you'd be hard put to name the group, in this pretty godless country, whom it had much chance of impressing. A morally ambitious leader makes another effort to raise self-examination to a higher level. It is strangely unpolitical. The conversion effect is hard to believe in. But public agonising about values makes him feel better. It's as close to religion as many people get.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

Essentially, though, this was part of Blair's pilgrimage in search of universal values. It was a fulfilment, Kung-like, of the ultimate ecumenicism, wherein all religions have their points. Like religion, like politics. The Blair view of politics is that there are the Tories - and then there is everyone else, crowding into the same big tent. Likewise, there are believers: Christian, Hindu, Muslim, others, who scarcely need to be differentiated. And then there are atheists, infidels beyond the gates, deprived not just of the blessing of belief but of meaningful guidance as to the best way forward in the public realm. The big point is that this is personal. It's not an electoral or political construct. Blair plans to give another \"values\" address to the evangelical Faith in the Future conference in Brighton next month. He does want to broaden the political audience. But there is no tokenism here. He never actually mentions God. The most serious believer among prime ministers for many decades eschews, in public, the source of the doctrine he believes in. He thereby shows good taste, and basic political discretion. But you can see a multi-headed god, or God, edging him forward, gnawing at him. William Hague, on the other hand, has decided Christians are a political niche-market. This is a new discovery for him, and it's narrowly faith-bound. He has taken to mentioning Christianity, if not God, a lot. But his personal stance has no pedigree, and his interest is functional. He's a conventional politician, there to tell and never to learn. \"Roll up your sleeves and get involved,\" he instructed 10,000 evangelicals at the Spring Harvest festival. \"The church is very much alive and advancing in many parts of this land\", he shamelessly preached, playing the audience like segmented voters. On the one hand, \"Jesus called us to serve the lonely as well as the hungry\" and similar pieties, on the other a series of claims that the Tories alone stand for marriage, the family and traditional British values of the kind that godly evangelicals believe in. Palpably, Hague's only quest is for votes. He is not searching for purpose, which needs no further definition than a Tory victory. The message, like the technique, is American, trailing hopefully in the wake of George W. Bush and his oxymoronic \"compassionate conservatism\". Last week the Tories summoned Bush's own guru, Marvin Olasky, who delivered a message of such born-again intolerance and exclusivity that even Hague's people got worried: \"God is a capitalist and free marketeer\", \"the evil of homosexuality\", mothers should not work, women should not run for president, Olasky said. Aligning religious fundamentalism with core Tory positions may make the heartland vote feel better. Otherwise Hague's flirtation with faith-politics is already looking like opportunism gone wrong. I think neither of these excursions away from the regular political agenda is likely to get far. The Hague approach treats Britain as if she were, or might become, America. The chances of that happening are as low as those of private charity here supplanting great tracts of public provision. Faith-politics works to some extent in the US, because many more Americans than British say they believe in a Christian God. For better or worse, God enters the political dialogue without embarrassment. Faith-based social programmes have reality because there are enough believers to carry them out. A Tory leader, whose own belief shows no sign of rising above the routine mouthings of generations of leaders before him, cannot be seen as anything other than a cynical dabbler in a market-place where honest trade is slow to non-existent. The Blair approach to faith has the virtue of originality. Doctrine doesn't matter much nor, even, does allegiance. What matters is the search for some kind of transcendental purpose, a quest that bothers the leader as much as it's meant to inspire the led. Mr Blair's visit to talk again with Hans Kung is the gratuitous act of a decently troubled man. If it were calculated, you'd be hard put to name the group, in this pretty godless country, whom it had much chance of impressing. A morally ambitious leader makes another effort to raise self-examination to a higher level. It is strangely unpolitical. The conversion effect is hard to believe in. But public agonising about values makes him feel better. It's as close to religion as many people get. hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

      "body": "<p>The first thing anyone asks Dr Kevin Fong is: \"Do you need an astronaut, do you need a rocket and do you need one of those big, whirly things - a centrifuge - like they have on James Bond?\" </p> <p>Fong thinks he doesn't really need any of those things, though the odd astronaut might come in handy. Fong is rather unusual: there can be few 29 year olds trained in astrophysics and medicine, who have worked for Nasa. In between dealing with patients in intensive care at Hammersmith Hospital, he is launching the first space biomedicine centre in Britain. The centre will be based at University College, London, and has the full support of the European Space Agency, ESA, and Nasa. Its main goal will be to teach and conduct research into how the human body is affected by space. </p> <p>\"In the past getting into outer space has been an engineering challenge, but you could measure these missions in hours or days - Mir was the longest at just over a year,\" says Fong. Now that liquid water has been (all but) discovered on Mars, one obstacle towards long haul space flights has been removed, namely carting water about and working out how to recycle it. Nasa wants to launch 8,000-day missions to Mars - that's almost 22 years. The problem is no longer engineering. Space, as Fong points out, is the biggest insult to the human body there is. Not only do muscles wither and bones disintegrate but space affects every single organ, every single cell in the body. </p> <p>Nasa flight surgeon Dr Terry Taddeo says: \"The first thing that happens is that once you're out of the pull of gravity, you experience a fluid shift. Standing around in 1G [earth's gravitational field] your blood and fluids tend to pool around your feet; once you're in microgravity [zero gravity], the fluids become more equally distributed and you tend to get this feeling of head stuffiness. You can see the veins in the neck become full of blood and it's described as the 'stuffy-head chicken-leg' syndrome.\" </p> <p> Without gravity, astronauts don't use their muscles as they would on earth; no new muscle fibres are produced, and even the composition of the muscles changes. Likewise, bones need not be so robust and the skeleton starts to leach calcium into the blood. The result is brittle bones while the excess calcium can clog up the kidneys and cause renal failure. Even bone marrow disappears at the rate of 1.5% per month. The heart shrinks and is not powerful enough to pump fully oxygenated blood around the body. You lose red blood cells. The neurofibular system, which is responsible for balance, is also affected. We balance by using our sense of sight, touch - not available in space since crew members are floating not walking -and the otoliths and semi-circular canals in the inner ear - also no good when you're drifting around in space. Since the only fully functioning sense is vision, it is no wonder astronauts find hand-eye co-ordination a little tricky; on their return to earth, even walking round a corner can present problems. </p> <p>The gut won't digest efficiently, lungs don't breath fully, and the immune system packs up resulting in a greater likelihood of succumbing to diseases caused by viruses, bacteria and fungal spores. The high level of radiation in space can cause cancer; even the minute organs within individual cells no longer function properly. </p> <p>A recent study conducted by Nasa showed that eye sight can deteriorate. They locked six volunteers in a simulated rocket for three months: since the rocket was only 6 metres across, the volunteers had problems adjusting to seeing greater distances when they were let out. </p> <p>\"It's a fantastic thing,\" says Fong. \"We evolved a hundred million years ago in a 1G world, and yet we adapt quickly to an environment with no gravity. The problem is readaptation on return to earth.\" </p> <p>No astronaut wants to return home with osteoporosis, dysfunctional kidneys, riddled with tumours and the balance of a football fan. </p> <p>The trouble with space travel doesn't just stop there: what if there's an emergency? As they say, no one can hear you scream in space. You can't resuscitate an astronaut with conventional ER techniques which rely on weight and gravity; even a drip won't work. </p> <p>This is where Fong's vision of a Space Biomedicine Centre comes in: not only will the research be aimed at helping the astronauts on earth as in space, but there could be huge benefits for ground-based medicine. </p> <p>There is an argument that spending vast sums of money on a few people who have chosen to risk their health is a waste, but Fong disagrees. \"The truth is that space technology is the only thing that will drive research rapidly via an interdiscipli nary approach into new directions. We'll be looking at the same problem from lots of different directions, from the point of view of a physicist to an evolutionary biologist, and that doesn't happen often.\" </p> <p>For example, Fong has created a portable system to turn non-sterile fluids into fluid so sterile it can be used intravenously. Obviously this is useful for astronauts who could recycle their washing water if need be, but one could imagine the potential of a microfiltration system for field hospitals, in flooded Mozambique, for example. </p> <p>Telemedicine has recently progressed in leaps and bounds, again, good for surgeons who need to speak to astronauts in space, but equally useful for doctors who want to converse with patients in rural areas. </p> <p>Much of the research will be particularly useful for patients in intensive care or accident and emergency wards since the focus of many space-age developments is geared towards high level miniaturisation of equipment and, in particular, for gadgets that will monitor patients minute by minute. </p> <p>Drugs being developed by Nasa to prevent osteoporosis in astronauts could have an immediate impact for sufferers here. </p> <p>But how do you do research into the effects of space travel without a rocket or an astronaut? Researchers will have to think of some pretty innovative ways of carrying out their studies. Currently ESA is looking at the effects of space travel bone wastage by asking healthy volunteers to spend three months in bed. </p> <p>The Space Biomedicine Centre is still embryonic: ESA and Nasa are willing to fly lecturers over here and allow students to study over there. However, UCL needs \u00a3500,000 to get it going. \"This is a screaming opportunity,\" says Fong, \"I wake up in the middle of the night and want to scream what a big opportunity this is.\" </p> <p> He points out that Britain used to be very good at tramping all over the globe, painting it pink and erecting flags, but when it comes to the final frontier, the UK is remarkably reticent. After all, there are no aliens on Mars to beat us at cricket. </p> <p>\"We've let ourselves be excluded from the space race,\"says Fong. \"The future of space exploration is now a global enterprise. For too long we've asked why should we be doing this, and we should be asking, why aren't we doing this?\"</p>",

The Independent Television Commission research also found that, for the first time, more than half of all households questioned said there was a second television set in a child's bedroom: 53% in 1999, up from 46% the previous year. Among children aged between 12 and 15, the figure rose to 78%. The BBC was sanguine yesterday, pointing out that the survey asked viewers what they thought rather than what they did. Researchers asked viewers to name the channel they would keep if they were allowed only one. Last year 41% named ITV, up one point on the previous year, against 30% for BBC1, down five. In terrestrial-only homes, the drop in popularity of BBC1 was even more marked: the gap between ITV (48%) and BBC1 (34%) has more than doubled since 1998. ITV's lead has increased from six to 14 points.",

      "bodyText": "Peter Mandelson last night warned both sides in the battle over electoral reform for Westminster not to close off options which might enable Britain to create a modern and accountable voting system. The Northern Ireland secretary warned passionate supporters of proportional representation that they may have to settle for the alternative vote system rather than a fully-fledged PR model of the kind Charles Kennedy's Liberal Democrats have sought for 70 years. Mr Mandelson insisted he has not yet made up his mind and Downing Street's spokesman said that \"if there was a referendum in the morning I suspect he [Mr Blair] would vote for first past the post [the existing system]\". But the thrust of last night's speech suggests that both men are clearly edging towards a compromise: the AV system which requires voters to pick a second preference and candidates to get more than 50% of the votes cast in order to win. In a speech to the pro-PR Make Votes Count group Mr Mandelson implicitly appealed to hostile Labour MPs, activists and trade unionists not to use next weekend's national policy forum meeting to reject the case for change. \"Supporters of first past the post should stop presenting the argument as a crude choice between 'change' and 'no change'. There is a world of difference between pure PR and more limited change such as the alternative vote [PR system],\" he said. \"And reformers should similarly acknowledge a range of options. They will greatly add to their credibility by acknowledging that the present first past the post system has considerable strengths and merits which we should not lose in any reformed system.\" He used his Northern Ireland experience to illustrate how deeply divided communities could benefit from PR to give both sides a real voice in government and even conceded that Welsh and Scottish devolution had also shown how PR systems had helped \"give people a greater say\". PR could also end local monopolies of power in town halls, he added. Mr Mandelson surprised some Labour MPs, most of whom are hostile to PR, by indicating that he too rejects that form of government for Westminster - preferring \"cooperation, not coalition,\" he suggested. \"I do not believe that perpetual coalitions make for efficient or effective government,\" Mr Mandelson said before adding that attempts to \"stifle or pre-empt debate\" either way would not be in the national interest. That is a slap in the face to PR campaigners. But Mr Kennedy refused to take offence. He is biding his time, waiting to see how Labour's internal battle resolves itself.

Grassroots Lib Dem activists may be less patient as the election approaches - and underline the kind of tactical voting which won the Blair-Ashdown partnership 465 seats in 1997. Mr Mandelson said: \"We cannot simply shut up shop without further debate.\" But he warned that the choice is not simply between a pure form of PR, the single transferable vote (STV) is what purists favour, or the compromise advocated in 1998 by Lord Jenkins, a former Labour chancellor and SDP leader. A private adviser to Mr Blair - even though he said last week that the prime minister has a \"second class mind\" - Lord Jenkins proposed a formula called AV-plus. That would have seen most of Westminster's MPs, around 500, elected in traditional constituencies in the usual way, except that each MP would need to get 50% of the votes cast. PR purists hate it on the grounds that it can produce even more \"unfair\" results than first-past-the-post, and would have increased Labour's 1997 landslide.

      "body": "<p>When his period of office at the BBC still had a long time to run, William Glock was called upon to give evidence to the Pilkington committee on the future of radio and television. Committees of inquiry into broadcasting in the early 1960s were no doubt a good deal readier to examine the BBC's occupation of the high ground than they would be now, but when Sir Harry Pilkington popped the question - what did the Controller, Music want to offer listeners? - the reply was startling: \"What they will like tomorrow\". </p> <p>It is hard to imagine anyone putting that view about in Broadcasting House now. Yet at a time when its Third Programme flourished, and the BBC was confident in itself, the resolve of Glock, who has died aged 92, carried all before it. More than for anything else he will be remembered for the 13 years he spent reviving the BBC's musical fortunes and restoring the corporation's role as musical patron and a leader of taste. The way he got on with it would make BBC management gasp now - or shudder; indeed, it would be unthinkable. But in a Reithian institution that its first director-general would still have recognised, Auntie gave him his head. </p> <p>Yet Glock was no demagogue. To the end of his life nothing pleased him more than to share enthusiasms with others. They were born of instinct, insight, taste and judgment, as those of good musicians habitually are, but in his case with a special place reserved for the play of judgment. He had been a fine critic, encouraged first by Richard Capell at the Daily Telegraph, and then invited in 1934 to join the Observer, to which he contributed until 1945. To do one's job in broadcasting, he used to say, was rather like a form of higher criticism: you made choices. He was decisive but not dogmatic, and he was not arrogant. Like Lord Reith, he believed music was for everybody, and his reply to Pilkington had been meant only as shorthand for the notion that it was just as essential, in his view, to create new expectations in listeners as to satisfy the old. </p> <p>When he went to the BBC, in 1959, Euroscepticism was still rife in the British musical establishment. Glock's appointment perplexed a lot of people, but already an underground movement had been pressing for change. By the time he left, in 1972, the reinvigoration of serious music broadcasting was complete. There had been great days before, and, in Edward Clark, Glock had had a distinguished predecessor whose programming of contemporary music in the years before 1939 was a model of enterprise. But in the period between them, BBC music was becalmed. I remember Peter Heyworth in the Observer in the 1950s berating the old music division for giving us always the latest cow-and-gate cantata and Cheltenham symphony, but rarely the latest Stravinsky. The Proms, BBC music's shop window, took no notice of a young audience growing up musically with the long-playing record - growing up, too, with the Third Programme. The BBC Symphony Orchestra, on its own, carried the burden of the concerts night after night, so no wonder the playing sounded tired. The programmes, too, were tired; in fact they were devised by a committee. </p> <p>William swept the committee aside, for which he was labelled Hitler by the old guard in Broadcasting House. Yet, prominent as the Proms are, they represent only a fraction of BBC music, and his campaign of re-enlivenment had to be sustained on a broad front. He took charge of the Proms and the BBC Symphony Orchestra's public concerts, but left all the other programmes to his staff. There were no edicts: he gave a lead, but producers had the freedom to pursue enthusiasms he might not have shared at all. Little-Britishers who didn't flourish under his regime have put it about that he operated a \"black list\", or a cartel of composers who were encouraged over and over again at the expense of others equally deserving. The thrust of Glock's policy was obvious, and omissions there may have been, but the notion of such a list is absurd. The only requirement he made of his staff was that in the building of programmes there should be an effort to combine enterprise and attractivenesss. </p> <p>As he acknowledged, he was lucky to come to the BBC when so much needed doing. With so much ground to be made up, periods of \"creative unbalance\", as he called them, could be justified. When he arrived, Schoenberg was rarely broadcast and Stravinsky by no means widely celebrated as a great composer. Webern was waiting for Pierre Boulez to conduct him. The work of Messiaen, Boulez, Berio, Nono, Dallapiccola, Carter, Tippett, Gerhard, Lutoslawski, Stockhausen, Henze and Ligeti needed to be regularly presented in the best performances that could be arranged. And younger composers, British in particular, had to be brought forward. </p> <p>His transformation of the Proms was not all foreseen from the beginning. To read him in each prospectus during the 14 Glock seasons (1960 to 1973) is to follow his concerns. He introduced foreign conductors (imagine it - there hadn't been any), and foreign orchestras, and made different patterns for the programmes. The fundamental repertory was there, but he complemented it with repertories not previously explored in the concerts. Above all, he was adventurous and looked for what was vital. To recall what took place is to be made aware of what a distinguished musician working in public service broadcasting could achieve. </p> <p>Before he came to the BBC - at the age of 50 - he was an outsider. He was born in Catford, south-east London: Christ's Hospital and Cambridge, where he read history, contributed something to his formation, though as organ scholar at Gonville &amp; Caius he failed the second part of the examination leading to a degree in music. The college did lend him an excellent Steinway, however. One foggy day early in 1930, a friend suggested they should motor over to Oxford to hear a pianist of whom the friend had heard glowing reports. The journey took six hours and they missed the first work on the programme, but the experience of Artur Schnabel playing the other two - Schubert's late A major sonata and the last sonata of Beethoven - changed Glock's life: \"I have always thought with deep gratitude of that foggy drive to Oxford, and of the standards and ideals of music-making it suddenly unfolded, and which I have tried never to lose.\" From then on, they fuelled his aspirations in everything, and not just as a pianist. </p> <p>Schnabel was responsible for his next challenge. On a visit to play at the first Edinburgh Festival, in 1947, he made the suggestion that there should be a summer school in England where audiences and young musicians together could hear outstanding performances and attend classes and lectures. He also suggested that Glock, his pupil for three years after that Oxford encounter, would be a good person to direct it. Summer schools were something new, but a financial backer was found and a course established at Bryanston in Dorset the very next year. It moved to Dartington in 1953, where Glock continued to direct it until 1979. From the beginning, he insisted on inviting to it great musicians from abroad as well as from this country. In the first year, the young Amadeus Quartet came, as well as Nadia Boulanger, and Hindemith took the composition class. Boris Blacher was there the next year, and then the greatest instrumental teacher the school ever had, Georges Enesco. There were four recitals by Elisabeth Schumann in 1950 and 1951. In 1957 Stravinsky was a visitor to Dartington for a fortnight. In bringing all this about, Glock's driving concern was that young musicians should be confronted with the highest possible standards, as he had been. </p> <p>During his BBC years, Dartington remained a fixture in his diary and nothing was allowed to get in its way, not even in the run-up to the Proms. He taught, lectured and performed there, and I often heard him say Dartington was a lifeline - not a sideline - because it kept him in touch with new work and new talent, and new ideas about music, and fed into what he was trying to achieve at the BBC. His editorship of the Score, from 1949, did the same, though after a while it became a casualty of the BBC appointment. It had been a magazine of exceptional quality, preoccupied with ideas rather than facts, with an international readership, and in the dozen years of its existence it caused storms. Through the 1950s it belonged, indeed, to the musical underground where Glock was a key player. He chaired the music section of the Institute of Contemporary Arts and ran the club and restaurant of the International Music Association (\"William's cafe\", as Sir Isaiah Berlin called it). The IMA was a good centre from which to dream of overthrowing the forces of British provincialism and plot the reform of BBC music division. </p> <p>It has been said that William Glock had a greater influence on musical culture in post-war Britain than anybody, and perhaps that is true. He would have been happier, I am sure, with a more modest epitaph: that he helped to make the understanding of music more acute. Inside and outside the BBC, he sought constantly for a repertory that was stimulating, and he made a strong commitment to the new, but one might say he did as much for Haydn and Schubert as for Stravinsky and Boulez. As for his BBC legacy, it needs re-articulating and defending by his successors in the same way as John Reith's does; it cannot be denied. More particularly, at the Proms every summer we take it for granted, and there, surely, there can be no going back. </p> <p>Glock's first marriage, to Clement Davenport, ended in divorce, and his daughter from it, Oriel, died in 1980. He married his second wife, Anne Geoffroy-Dechaume, in 1952, and she died in 1995. He is survived by four step-children: Natalie Davenport from his first marriage, and Nicholas, Sebastian and Veronica Balfour from his second. </p> <p>\u0095 William Frederick Glock, music administrator, born May 3 1908, died June 28 2000</p>",

The thrust of Glock's policy was obvious, and omissions there may have been, but the notion of such a list is absurd. The only requirement he made of his staff was that in the building of programmes there should be an effort to combine enterprise and attractivenesss. As he acknowledged, he was lucky to come to the BBC when so much needed doing. With so much ground to be made up, periods of \"creative unbalance\", as he called them, could be justified. When he arrived, Schoenberg was rarely broadcast and Stravinsky by no means widely celebrated as a great composer. Webern was waiting for Pierre Boulez to conduct him. The work of Messiaen, Boulez, Berio, Nono, Dallapiccola, Carter, Tippett, Gerhard, Lutoslawski, Stockhausen, Henze and Ligeti needed to be regularly presented in the best performances that could be arranged. And younger composers, British in particular, had to be brought forward. His transformation of the Proms was not all foreseen from the beginning. To read him in each prospectus during the 14 Glock seasons (1960 to 1973) is to follow his concerns. He introduced foreign conductors (imagine it - there hadn't been any), and foreign orchestras, and made different patterns for the programmes. The fundamental repertory was there, but he complemented it with repertories not previously explored in the concerts. Above all, he was adventurous and looked for what was vital. To recall what took place is to be made aware of what a distinguished musician working in public service broadcasting could achieve. Before he came to the BBC - at the age of 50 - he was an outsider. He was born in Catford, south-east London: Christ's Hospital and Cambridge, where he read history, contributed something to his formation, though as organ scholar at Gonville &amp; Caius he failed the second part of the examination leading to a degree in music. The college did lend him an excellent Steinway, however. One foggy day early in 1930, a friend suggested they should motor over to Oxford to hear a pianist of whom the friend had heard glowing reports. The journey took six hours and they missed the first work on the programme, but the experience of Artur Schnabel playing the other two - Schubert's late A major sonata and the last sonata of Beethoven - changed Glock's life: \"I have always thought with deep gratitude of that foggy drive to Oxford, and of the standards and ideals of music-making it suddenly unfolded, and which I have tried never to lose.\" From then on, they fuelled his aspirations in everything, and not just as a pianist. Schnabel was responsible for his next challenge. On a visit to play at the first Edinburgh Festival, in 1947, he made the suggestion that there should be a summer school in England where audiences and young musicians together could hear outstanding performances and attend classes and lectures. He also suggested that Glock, his pupil for three years after that Oxford encounter, would be a good person to direct it. Summer schools were something new, but a financial backer was found and a course established at Bryanston in Dorset the very next year. It moved to Dartington in 1953, where Glock continued to direct it until 1979. From the beginning, he insisted on inviting to it great musicians from abroad as well as from this country. In the first year, the young Amadeus Quartet came, as well as Nadia Boulanger, and Hindemith took the composition class. Boris Blacher was there the next year, and then the greatest instrumental teacher the school ever had, Georges Enesco. There were four recitals by Elisabeth Schumann in 1950 and 1951. In 1957 Stravinsky was a visitor to Dartington for a fortnight. In bringing all this about, Glock's driving concern was that young musicians should be confronted with the highest possible standards, as he had been. During his BBC years, Dartington remained a fixture in his diary and nothing was allowed to get in its way, not even in the run-up to the Proms. He taught, lectured and performed there, and I often heard him say Dartington was a lifeline - not a sideline - because it kept him in touch with new work and new talent, and new ideas about music, and fed into what he was trying to achieve at the BBC. His editorship of the Score, from 1949, did the same, though after a while it became a casualty of the BBC appointment. It had been a magazine of exceptional quality, preoccupied with ideas rather than facts, with an international readership, and in the dozen years of its existence it caused storms. Through the 1950s it belonged, indeed, to the musical underground where Glock was a key player. He chaired the music section of the Institute of Contemporary Arts and ran the club and restaurant of the International Music Association (\"William's cafe\", as Sir Isaiah Berlin called it). The IMA was a good centre from which to dream of overthrowing the forces of British provincialism and plot the reform of BBC music division. It has been said that William Glock had a greater influence on musical culture in post-war Britain than anybody, and perhaps that is true. He would have been happier, I am sure, with a more modest epitaph: that he helped to make the understanding of music more acute. Inside and outside the BBC, he sought constantly for a repertory that was stimulating, and he made a strong commitment to the new, but one might say he did as much for Haydn and Schubert as for Stravinsky and Boulez. As for his BBC legacy, it needs re-articulating and defending by his successors in the same way as John Reith's does; it cannot be denied. More particularly, at the Proms every summer we take it for granted, and there, surely, there can be no going back. Glock's first marriage, to Clement Davenport, ended in divorce, and his daughter from it, Oriel, died in 1980. He married his second wife, Anne Geoffroy-Dechaume, in 1952, and she died in 1995. He is survived by four step-children: Natalie Davenport from his first marriage, and Nicholas, Sebastian and Veronica Balfour from his second. \u0095 William Frederick Glock, music administrator, born May 3 1908, died June 28 2000",

Today, 5% of the 3000 Pingelapese suffer from a rare type of colour blindness and their DNA has helped scientists track down a gene for colour vision. In July's Nature Genetics, the scientists tell how they took DNA from 32 islanders, half of whom had the disorder and spotted a segment of DNA on chromosome 8 that appears in the colour blind inhabitants. The DNA includes a gene responsible for a protein in those eye cells that detect colour. The study \"is a beautiful example of the use of isolated populations to study human disease,\" observes geneticist Val Sheffield. Saving your liver's bacon The ancient Greeks were smart. Around 700 BC Hesiod described how each day a giant eagle ate the liver of the chained Prometheus. Each day, he related, the liver replenished itself. We now know how. Scientists from Yale and New York have shown in humans that the new cells do not come from the liver itself, but from stem cells in the bone marrow. For years scientists have debated whether humans have liver stem cells. \"The long-held belief has been that bone marrow is supposed toproduce blood cells and liver is supposed to produce liver cells,\" says Dr Diane Krause. \"The goal is now to harness the potential of this exciting find.\"",

More than \u00a35m has been shaved off the cost of maintaining them and from their travel expenses in the last year. After a second day of tabloid outrage at Ms Mowlam's suggestion in an interview with Saga managzine that the palaces were no longer appropriate in the modern world, she yesterday felt the need to issue an apology to the Queen. The Cabinet Office minister told reporters in Blackpool, where she was attending an Association of Chief Police Officers' conference on drugs: \"I apologise for any hurt I have caused.\" The comments had first been made six years ago and had been in the context of the modernisation of the monarchy, she said. Buckingham Palace was now in the process of modernising. Asked about her ministerial future she replied: \"I have no idea.

The money still comes from grants-in-aid from government departments, voted by parliament, but is now administered by the Royal Household. Sir Michael Peat, keeper of the privy purse (effectively supervisor of the Queen's accounts), claimed that the reports showed good progress. \"These reports demonstrate the Royal Household's commitment to transparency and accountability, and show our determination to achieve value for money without lowering standards,\" declared Sir Michael. As part of that commitment, the royal family is making less use of the RAF's 32 Squadron aircraft and more use of its leased Sikorsky helicopter, as well as a further chartered Sikorsky. The charter use has tripled but the cost of using these helicopters is half that of the RAF Wessex helicopters used previously. Nonetheless the report, in breaking down official journeys undertaken last year, gives the impression that the family pop into a helicopter as readily as others call taxis. A trip by the Duke of Edinburgh from Windsor to Worcester for the county's centenary cricket match against the Australians, and on to Buckingham Palace cost \u00a31,186, while the Prince of Wales's return flight from his home at Highgrove to Wembley to present the FA Challenge Cup came in at \u00a31,484. The cost of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh's overnight visit by the royal train from Euston to Nottingham last December to visit a shopping centre, the city's hospital, university, and Nottingham Forest FC, came in at \u00a314,200. The report points out that the train has been cut back to two locomotives and nine carriages from 14 carriages, with only five to eight of the carriages in use at any one time. Last June, the Princess Royal took a charter flight from Gatcombe to Lymington to attend an event at the Royal Lymington Yacht Club and then to Buckingham Palace at a cost of \u00a33,086. Her assiduous attendance at all Scotland's international rugby matches, as the team's patron, cost more than \u00a31,000 each time, while flying from Gloucestershire to attend an annual award dinner at Ascot cost \u00a32,621. For the rugby World Cup final at Cardiff, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh flew in by BAe 1456, costing \u00a32,559, while the Princess Royal took a helicopter flight from Gloucestershire for \u00a31,223.

      "body": "<p>Perhaps, in order to get the weather we want for Wimbledon fortnight, we should be ripping the hearts out of virgins. </p> <p>It worked for the Aztecs: concerned that the sun might not rise the next day, they ensured the new dawn with a ritual evening sacrifice. Not once did they fail to get the result they wanted. Finding periodicity and predictability in the processes of our natural climate is as important to us as it was to the Aztecs, says Michael Ghil, professor of climate dynamics at the University of California, Los Angeles. </p> <p>Today's meteorologists focus on prediction, rather than the control the Aztecs sought. But the ancient urge may be coming back, Ghil says: improve our understanding of the processes involved, and the weather could eventually be ours to direct. </p> <p>It's a long-term goal, of course, which will arise from the drive towards more reliable weather predictions. Currently, detailed forecasts are possible over only a few days. Even stretching to 10-day forecasts can be too inaccurate for many circumstances. To do better, Ghil says, we need to follow the example of history and identify the persistent and recurring features in the weather. </p> <p>All ancient civilisations, he points out, learned astronomy to find out about natural patterns in the sun, moon and weather: with that information they could learn how to adapt and survive. Today, weather researchers use vast supercomputers to process data from satellites, aircraft, ships, drifting buoys and ground stations in an effort to find ways to determine next week's conditions. But as we accumulate decades of detailed information, Ghil says, we will eventually be able to control the weather, not just react to it. </p> <p>Ghil spoke about his controversial idea earlier this month at a Los Alamos National Laboratory conference on the future impacts of science. He is unapologetic. \"We have gradually been controlling more and more of our environment: it's natural that we should want to do this,\" he says. And with new technology and insights, he believes, it's no longer a pipe dream. </p> <p>\"With the theoretical tools that we now have and additional observations which will accumulate over the next decades, I really believe we are going to make substantial progress on this matter.\" The process could revolutionise world agriculture, he says. \"We can't steer the detailed course of a storm but we should be able to control average temperatures and the length of growing seasons in large areas of the globe.\" </p> <p> Ghil wants to exert climate control by controlling the radiation in the atmosphere: incoming radiation from the sun and outgoing radiation from the earth. There are substances in the atmosphere which can be used as \"shutters. \"Greenhouse\" gases such as carbon dioxide tend to keep radiation in. Aerosols high in the atmosphere, on the other hand, keep it out. </p> <p>With these shutters, Ghil says, it should be possible to control the radiation that heats the earth and oceans and drives our weather systems. </p> <p>\"If we understood all the other things that are happening within the climate system as we play with these shutters, there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to regulate climate - both globally and regionally - fairly effectively,\" Ghil says. </p> <p>And, he adds, there should be no need to put additional greenhouse gases or aerosols into the stratosphere. The big stumbling block is that, as yet, we simply don't understand the processes involved in our climate well enough. Interactions between the air and the world's oceans and ice sheets, for example, have influence that scientists are nowhere near fully understanding. </p> <p>But things are getting better.

      "bodyText": "Perhaps, in order to get the weather we want for Wimbledon fortnight, we should be ripping the hearts out of virgins. It worked for the Aztecs: concerned that the sun might not rise the next day, they ensured the new dawn with a ritual evening sacrifice. Not once did they fail to get the result they wanted. Finding periodicity and predictability in the processes of our natural climate is as important to us as it was to the Aztecs, says Michael Ghil, professor of climate dynamics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Today's meteorologists focus on prediction, rather than the control the Aztecs sought. But the ancient urge may be coming back, Ghil says: improve our understanding of the processes involved, and the weather could eventually be ours to direct. It's a long-term goal, of course, which will arise from the drive towards more reliable weather predictions. Currently, detailed forecasts are possible over only a few days. Even stretching to 10-day forecasts can be too inaccurate for many circumstances. To do better, Ghil says, we need to follow the example of history and identify the persistent and recurring features in the weather. All ancient civilisations, he points out, learned astronomy to find out about natural patterns in the sun, moon and weather: with that information they could learn how to adapt and survive. Today, weather researchers use vast supercomputers to process data from satellites, aircraft, ships, drifting buoys and ground stations in an effort to find ways to determine next week's conditions. But as we accumulate decades of detailed information, Ghil says, we will eventually be able to control the weather, not just react to it. Ghil spoke about his controversial idea earlier this month at a Los Alamos National Laboratory conference on the future impacts of science. He is unapologetic. \"We have gradually been controlling more and more of our environment: it's natural that we should want to do this,\" he says. And with new technology and insights, he believes, it's no longer a pipe dream. \"With the theoretical tools that we now have and additional observations which will accumulate over the next decades, I really believe we are going to make substantial progress on this matter.\" The process could revolutionise world agriculture, he says. \"We can't steer the detailed course of a storm but we should be able to control average temperatures and the length of growing seasons in large areas of the globe.\" Ghil wants to exert climate control by controlling the radiation in the atmosphere: incoming radiation from the sun and outgoing radiation from the earth. There are substances in the atmosphere which can be used as \"shutters. \"Greenhouse\" gases such as carbon dioxide tend to keep radiation in. Aerosols high in the atmosphere, on the other hand, keep it out. With these shutters, Ghil says, it should be possible to control the radiation that heats the earth and oceans and drives our weather systems. \"If we understood all the other things that are happening within the climate system as we play with these shutters, there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to regulate climate - both globally and regionally - fairly effectively,\" Ghil says. And, he adds, there should be no need to put additional greenhouse gases or aerosols into the stratosphere. The big stumbling block is that, as yet, we simply don't understand the processes involved in our climate well enough. Interactions between the air and the world's oceans and ice sheets, for example, have influence that scientists are nowhere near fully understanding. But things are getting better. There has been significant progress in maths and physics, and researchers have gained a much better grasp of the nature of interactions within large natural systems over the last 30 years. Ghil is aware that, in the current environmental and political climate, tinkering with the meteorological climate is controversial, to say the least. But, he says, climate control will only come about because of an entirely justifiable scientific endeavour aiming to understand and predict the weather. \"I think it would be foolish not to stimulate the growth of that knowledge,\" he says. When we reach the point where we could take deliberate action to change the weather, global authorities would have to make the decisions: after all, chaos would erupt if Nigeria could award itself more rainfall without paying heed to the consequences for its neighbours.

He told his followers in the Aesthetic Movement to wear green carnations supplied by his florist, Goodyears: \"They grow them there.\" </p> <p>Flamboyant colour has always been associated with the pursuit of the beautiful, with aestheticism, with hedonist visual pleasure. Think of Matisse and his painting The Red Studio, in which every object in the room is choreographed to the rhythm of an overwhelming red; the boundaries of walls, a table and a clock are visible only as traces in redness.

The very vocabulary of colour is saturated in ideas of beauty; the word \"hue\" comes from the Old English for \"beauty\". </p> <p>John Gage, reader in the history of western art at Cambridge and the world's leading authority on colour, is an art historian who writes about art sensuously. In fact, he writes about it so sensuously that his books are prose poems, fantasias of colour disguised as academic texts. And Gage is wonderful to talk to. He discusses modern art and medieval stained glass with the same precision, describing the way artists use colour so acutely that he changes the way you look at art - you see more colours. When asked to explain the way Mark Rothko manipulates our emotions with colour in the Seagram Murals at Tate Modern, he says, \"The Seagram things use an extremely low tone, and also very close tones - rather light, fiery elements in a few places. The overall tone is dark purple, black, blackish, very dark reds - colours that are very closely related to each other. Close [colour] relationships seem to induce a feeling of reverie or melancholy, whereas high contrast has the capacity to wake one up a bit.\" </p> <p>There's more than a hint of the aesthete about Gage - he wanted to be a painter when he was young - and he talks with a deep sense of the joy of art. But he says I've come to the wrong place in my search for a definition of beauty. It's not his thing, because he's not a formalist. In art theory formalism is the doctrine - propagated by the Bloomsbury critic Roger Fry - that the value of art lies entirely in its formal properties. Formalism and the attitude it implies - that the love of art has nothing to do with everyday life and that art lovers are special people able to rise above the mess of existence - epitomise everything that has given the worship of beauty a bad name. </p> <p>Matisse notoriously said he wanted his art to be like an armchair for a tired businessman - a place of luxury and intellectual rest. The way Matisse surrenders to colour, dives into colour, looks like the very definition of an art that leaves us with nothing to say but, \"That's beautiful.\" Nonsense, says Gage. The unruly colours with which Matisse infused everything and that won him and his close associates Derain and Vlaminck the nickname \"fauves\" - wild beasts - deliberately evoke the way people play with colour in everyday life, especially in their clothes. \"Matisse makes a lot of play with the colour of dress,\" he says. \"If people use the Fauves as the indication that colour has floated free of representation, I find that extremely hard.\" </p> <p>Colour moves us, Gage argues, because history saturates it with associations, connotations, symbolism. We're always talking about colour as if its impact on us was fixed and natural. We talk about red being a hot, warm colour, and blue cool, refreshing. But there's nothing natural or permanent about such ideas: the first mentions date from the 18th century. The meaning we attribute to light and darkness - associating light with joy, freedom, heaven - dates from the Renaissance. </p> <p>Early medieval churches used heavily coloured stained glass to create a mystical gloom. In the late middle ages and the Renaissance there was a new cult of light: colours were praised according to how \"luminous\" they looked; painters learned to make the blue of the sky come alive, as it does in Titian's (restored) Bacchus and Ariadne in the National Gallery. Light was associated with \"laughter\", as can be seen in the oculus, the opening in the ceiling, that Mantegna painted in the ducal palace at Mantua, which has the celestial beings looking down from their world of blue light, laughing. </p> <p>There are many histories of blue. In the 60s Yves Klein patented YKB, Yves Klein Blue, and used it in monochrome canvases and to cover everyday objects, which, by that gesture, were transformed into symbols. \"Klein chose a colour that has an extraordinary resonance in Europe,\" says Gage. \"It's a sort of ultramarine blue - it's got a slight reddish cast to it - and of course that has longstanding connotations of the divine, of the transcendental.\" </p> <p>Klein's blue is a blue of darkness rather than light: it's the sublime blue of inner experience. Derek Jarman confirmed the poetic power of blue in his film Blue, about his experience of Aids and losing his sight. Gage praises Jarman's book on colour, Chroma (1994), as more useful than many scientific works on the subject, in the way it relates colours to personal history. </p> <p>Black, says Gage, has often been considered the finest colour. From 15th-century nobles showing off their austere robes, to Coco Chanel, wearing black has been a way of marking yourself out from the crowd. \"Black has always been a sign of high value, partly because it's extremely hard to produce a good black in clothes. It's extremely hard to keep clean and so it's an index of taking care of yourself, which is a rather smart thing to do.\" </p> <p>Black is beautiful, black is aesthetic. Manet's group portrait The Balcony (1868-9) celebrates the sartorial grandeur of black by showing his friend Antoine Guillemet in a black coat before a black background. Yet Matisse, the supreme modern aesthete, exploited the frightening symbolism of blackness. In one of his essays Gage demonstrates how Matisse, in his 1914 painting French Window - Collioure, transformed the middle-class balcony scene into an image of the horror he saw ahead as Europe went to war. The painting shows two blue panel blinds swung open to reveal nothing but blackness - a \"luminous\" black as Gage calls it. </p> <p>For all his scepticism, Gage gives an exciting description of the emotional impact of the beautiful. \"It is all over the place - and in very surprising places,\" he says. \"And because it's not the sort of subject that is talked about very much nowadays we don't actually have to engage very much with it, do we? In visual art it's become extremely unfashionable. I suppose architects do have a sneaking interest in it from time to time. Elegance is certainly something that I recognise - an economy of means.

It has to knock you off your feet a bit...\" Gage's writing demonstrates that even the most knock-you-off-your feet, contentless abstract painting, the emptiest wall of pure colour, delivers more than a rush. It connects you to the world. \u0095 Next week, cultural critic Laura Mulvey. John Gage's books Colour and Meaning (\u00a319.95) and Colour and Culture (\u00a329.95) are both published by Thames and Hudson.",

      "bodyText": "Outspoken former minister Peter Kilfoyle is to tone down his criticism of Tony Blair and Labour to concentrate his fire on William Hague and the Conservatives. The Liverpool Walton MP, who spectacularly quit his defence post earlier this year after growing disillusioned with the government's direction, has been wooed by Millbank. Mr Kilfoyle is to team up with Tory-turned-Labour MP Shaun Woodward and Blairite MP Fraser Kemp to write what he promises will be a \"devastating blast\" against Mr Hague and the rightwing. The book has the backing of the Labour leadership and marks a thawing in relations with the party hierarchy. The MP has remained friendly with Margaret McDonagh, Labour's general secretary. Since he resigned from the government, Mr Kilfoyle has been one of the government's most trenchant critics, arguing it was neglecting traditional Labour voters and had turned its back on pensioners. A series of speeches in Labour heartlands by Mr Kilfoyle to win back disaffected voters is also under consideration. A parliamentary colleague yesterday said he wanted to remain free to criticse the Labour leadership but would make clear who he regards the \"real enemy\" to be. Earlier this year Mr Kilfoyle ridiculed Mr Blair's assertion there was no north-south divide, condemned Gordon Brown's 75p rise for pensioners, complained about NHS and education spending, dismissed electoral reform as \"futile\" and warned Labour voters were turning away \"in droves... they see nothing in it for them.\"",

Mr Kennedy challenged Mr Blair about the documents in the Commons yesterday. \"Why does the government continue to announce funding which doesn't exist and won't you admit that this is another attempt at a triumph of spin over substance?\" he asked.</p> <p>Mr Blair rejected Mr Kennedy's accusations as \"absurd\" because funding for the action zones is to increase by 37.6% to \u00a3120m, although this is lower than the government had originally allocated.</p> <p>The row came as the prime minister made light of new accusations that his official spokesman is overstepping the mark by ordering civil servants to prepare a public relations offensive to boost the government.</p> <p>Asked about the disclosure in yesterday's Guardian about Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair joked that he was now redundant because there was so much good news about the government.</p> <p>But ministers faced further embarrassment over spin yesterday when the head of a care in the community enquiry said that the publication of her report had been delayed to ensure it did not interfere with \"good news\" about the NHS.</p> <p>The report by Aswini Weereratne into the case of Shane Bath, who bludgeoned to death his partner nine months after leaving the care of Dorset health authority, has been ready for several weeks. But Ms Weereratne said that the health authority had called for the report's publication to be delayed until after a series of positive announcements about the NHS.</p> <p>\"A date of July 6 was initially agreed upon by all those who would have to attend publication of the report,\" Ms Weereratne told Radio 4's The World at One. She added that that she was then informed that July 6 would not be possible \"because the DoH had indicated that that date fell in what is designated NHS good news week.\"</p> <p>The government dismissed her claims.</p> <p>The Department of Health said: \"There is no mystery here. The launch of the report was moved because of the availability of all the interested parties to attend. There will be a full press conference to publish the report next month.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair faced renewed embarrassment over spin yesterday when leaked government documents showed that ministers are drawing up plans to bury news of a drop in funding for a flagship health initiative. The documents, which were unearthed by the Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, show that the Department of Health is attempting to manipulate a new funding announcement for health action zones (HAZs) because \"it will not be received as good news\". In a draft letter to the chairmen of the 26 HAZs, which were set up to improve health care in deprived areas, the health minister, John Hutton, was forced to admit that funding \"is less than we had previously indicated\". Another document recommends that the Department of Health should not issue a press release on the new funding and ministers should avoid writing letters to MPs. \"This will not be received as good news and we would not recommend a press release,\" the document says. Mr Kennedy challenged Mr Blair about the documents in the Commons yesterday. \"Why does the government continue to announce funding which doesn't exist and won't you admit that this is another attempt at a triumph of spin over substance?\" he asked. Mr Blair rejected Mr Kennedy's accusations as \"absurd\" because funding for the action zones is to increase by 37.6% to \u00a3120m, although this is lower than the government had originally allocated. The row came as the prime minister made light of new accusations that his official spokesman is overstepping the mark by ordering civil servants to prepare a public relations offensive to boost the government. Asked about the disclosure in yesterday's Guardian about Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair joked that he was now redundant because there was so much good news about the government. But ministers faced further embarrassment over spin yesterday when the head of a care in the community enquiry said that the publication of her report had been delayed to ensure it did not interfere with \"good news\" about the NHS. The report by Aswini Weereratne into the case of Shane Bath, who bludgeoned to death his partner nine months after leaving the care of Dorset health authority, has been ready for several weeks. But Ms Weereratne said that the health authority had called for the report's publication to be delayed until after a series of positive announcements about the NHS. \"A date of July 6 was initially agreed upon by all those who would have to attend publication of the report,\" Ms Weereratne told Radio 4's The World at One. She added that that she was then informed that July 6 would not be possible \"because the DoH had indicated that that date fell in what is designated NHS good news week.\" The government dismissed her claims. The Department of Health said: \"There is no mystery here. The launch of the report was moved because of the availability of all the interested parties to attend. There will be a full press conference to publish the report next month.\"",

The files hastily deleted between September 30 1998 - two days after the CDU was defeated in the general election - and October 22, five days before power was transferred to the present chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. Mr Hirsch, a politician and member of the liberal Free Democrats, said traces left on computer hard drives showed that the three gigabytes of data destroyed included records of deals at the core of the scandal over CDU funding sources.

Last night the government announced that preliminary disciplinary proceedings had begun against several civil servants.

The Portuguese prime minister, Antonio Guterres, said he had not managed to build a consensus among the 14 states which took unprecedented collective action against Austria, the EU's 15th member, in February. France, a hardliner on Austria, takes over the EU's rotating presidency from Portugal on Saturday. \"At the moment there is no common stance,\" Mr Guterres admitted. Diplomats said a proposal for a committee of \"wise men\" to monitor the human-rights record of the Austrian coalition was complete but, crucially, there was no agreement on a date to lift the sanctions. The measures were imposed after Austria's conservative chancellor, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, formed a government with the far-right Freedom party, then led by the controversial J\u00f6rg Haider. Mr Guterres had hoped to bring about an agreement before handing over the EU's helm to France. But it was touch and go last night whether he would manage before tomorrow evening. Sweden, which takes over the presidency next January, will be far keener than France to find a way out of the increasingly embarrassing impasse. The French president, Jacques Chirac, has said he will not lift the sanctions during his turn at the presidency. But an EU official said: \"The trick will be to leapfrog over the French so that the Swedes can recommend suspending or lifting sanctions.\" Any agreement will have to be endorsed by Austria itself, which could create further difficulties. Portugal's idea is to appoint three wise men - a classic EU trick to wriggle out of a tight corner - to assess Vienna's commitment to \"common European values\" - in particular the rights of minorities, refugees and immigrants. The three, likely to be judges of the European court of human rights in Strasbourg, would also examine \"the political nature\" of the Freedom party, which EU governments regard as racist. The Austrian vice-chancellor, Susanne Riess-Passer, who replaced Mr Haider as the Freedom party leader last month, says an indefinite delay would be unacceptable. The bitter row has overshadowed EU business and threatens to delay the vital work of reforming the union before it takes in new members, starting in 2003. At last week's EU summit in Portugal, Austria demonstrated its capacity for disruption when it blocked a deal on the controversial scheme to withhold tax on savings, and insisted that for \"constitutional reasons\" it could not endorse it. Mr Sch\u00fcssel has warned that he will hold a referendum in the autumn to ask voters to express their disapproval if no method of ending the sanctions is in place by tomorrow. Other member states have warned that a referendum could whip up anti-EU sentiment, which many argue is the single most significant outcome of an ill-considered and hasty move. Britain is anxious to end the boycott, having been bounced into the original decision by Tony Blair's direct contacts with other EU leaders, against the advice of the Foreign Office. Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, pointed out last week that 70% of Austrians had never voted for the Freedom party. Mr Haider said yesterday that the latest EU proposal represented mere \"tactical games\" and urged Mr Sch\u00fcssel to go ahead with the referendum. The sanctions have caused bitterness in Austria, where officials complain they would not have been imposed on a bigger member state.",

The full findings will be published in the next few days.</p> <p>The London borough of Islington, whose school services were \"outsourced\" to private-sector consultants Cambridge Education Associates (CEA) earlier this year, has spent more than \u00a33m trying to turn the school around.</p> <p>It reopened with a new name and Britain's first \"superhead\", Torsten Friedag, last September. But in March he resigned unexpectedly from his \u00a370,000 post after reports of a serious breakdown in discipline and concerns about poor academic performance.</p> <p>The draft report is understood to praise the management at the school and CEA for starting to improve standards at the school, while criticising Islington council for failing to support the school under the previous regime.</p> <p>But the inspectors concluded that despite the hard work of the management team, the school \"had not achieved the level of progress hoped for\", with unsatisfactory teaching in many lessons.</p> <p>Among some positive findings understood to be in the draft report are that the average daily attendance level increased by 10% during the summer term, while progress was made in \"curriculum development\" and lesson preparation and planning. Overall, the school was found to be \"a calm and orderly environment which cares for and recognises the diverse needs of the pupil community\".</p> <p>CEA and the school will respond tomorrow by publishing a plan for urgent improvement. Among the measures are understood to be: developing the work of the governing body by appointing extra governors; setting up a training programme to improve the work of middle managers; identifying a range of subject-specific consultants; working with the education welfare service to boost attendance and punctuality; and supporting the school by recruiting and retaining staff who will bring the experience and expertise necessary to maintain the progress of a fresh start school.</p> <p>Defending the fresh start programme, a Department for Education spokesman said: \"Fresh start is not an easy option, but the alternative of leaving a school to fail until it drifts into closure is not acceptable.\"</p> <p>Mr Friedag's departure was followed by a rash of resignations by other heads of \"fresh start\" schools, including Tony Garwood, who quit as head of East Brighton arts and media college.</p> <p>The school, which is also being run by an acting head, was taken into special measures this month amid criticism of Mr Garwood's leadership by Ofsted inspectors.</p> <p>\u0095A total of 95% of trainee teachers passed the first numeracy test designed to raise standards of numeracy in the profession, it will be announced today. The results of the test, taken earlier this month at a cost of \u00a3900,000 to taxpayers this year, show that only 1,145 students failed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government's drive to revive failing schools will be dealt a fresh blow today, when governors of the Islington arts and media school are told that the education watchdog, Ofsted, has ordered that it be taken back into emergency rescue measures. The former George Orwell school is the second of the nine \"fresh start\" schools to be put on special measures after being deemed to be failing. The Ofsted order came after a two-day visit by inspectors last week who found that it had not made sufficient progress since its reopening last year. Governors at the comprehensive school in north London will be told the news at a meeting this evening by the acting head, Jim Hudson, who has been handed a draft report which confirms initial verbal feedback from inspectors. The full findings will be published in the next few days. The London borough of Islington, whose school services were \"outsourced\" to private-sector consultants Cambridge Education Associates (CEA) earlier this year, has spent more than \u00a33m trying to turn the school around. It reopened with a new name and Britain's first \"superhead\", Torsten Friedag, last September. But in March he resigned unexpectedly from his \u00a370,000 post after reports of a serious breakdown in discipline and concerns about poor academic performance. The draft report is understood to praise the management at the school and CEA for starting to improve standards at the school, while criticising Islington council for failing to support the school under the previous regime. But the inspectors concluded that despite the hard work of the management team, the school \"had not achieved the level of progress hoped for\", with unsatisfactory teaching in many lessons. Among some positive findings understood to be in the draft report are that the average daily attendance level increased by 10% during the summer term, while progress was made in \"curriculum development\" and lesson preparation and planning. Overall, the school was found to be \"a calm and orderly environment which cares for and recognises the diverse needs of the pupil community\". CEA and the school will respond tomorrow by publishing a plan for urgent improvement. Among the measures are understood to be: developing the work of the governing body by appointing extra governors; setting up a training programme to improve the work of middle managers; identifying a range of subject-specific consultants; working with the education welfare service to boost attendance and punctuality; and supporting the school by recruiting and retaining staff who will bring the experience and expertise necessary to maintain the progress of a fresh start school. Defending the fresh start programme, a Department for Education spokesman said: \"Fresh start is not an easy option, but the alternative of leaving a school to fail until it drifts into closure is not acceptable.\" Mr Friedag's departure was followed by a rash of resignations by other heads of \"fresh start\" schools, including Tony Garwood, who quit as head of East Brighton arts and media college. The school, which is also being run by an acting head, was taken into special measures this month amid criticism of Mr Garwood's leadership by Ofsted inspectors. \u0095A total of 95% of trainee teachers passed the first numeracy test designed to raise standards of numeracy in the profession, it will be announced today. The results of the test, taken earlier this month at a cost of \u00a3900,000 to taxpayers this year, show that only 1,145 students failed.",

The government admitted it had breached article three of the European convention on human rights, which guarantees protection from \"torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\", because Bedfordshire county council knew of the children's plight for nearly five years before it took them into care. A child psychiatrist who assessed the two boys and two girls, called \"Z and others\" to conceal their identities, described their case as \"horrific\" and the worst case of parental neglect and emotional abuse she had seen in her career.

Is it normal for animals to take naturally occurring drugs?</b> <p> \u0095 During the hot summer of 1976, one of my student housemates succeeded in growing two cannabis plants about eight feet high in our terrace backyard. Our cat loved standing on the adjacent fence and nibbling the leaves, after which she would sit on the fence - in a state that can only be described as \"spaced out\" - until she recovered enough to step daintily along the fence for another helping. None of the other cats in our house, or locally, showed any similar interest. </p> <p><b> Mary Gibbs</b>, Rusholme, Manchester. </p> <p> \u0095 In the mid-1970s, our English setter pup dug up our lodger's dope stash, which he had buried in the garden. We returned from work to find the pup prostrate on the lawn with a glazed expression in his eyes. He recovered after a couple of hours and seemed none the worse for the experience. Indeed, he must have enjoyed it. From then on, he would seek it out dope at every opportunity, showing great enthusiasm and affection for anyone carrying any. Is this how the police train their sniffer dogs? </p> <p><b> Bob Newbury</b>, Jersey.</p> <p> \u0095 French friends of mine keep a canary, which they feed on mixed seeds bought from the local pet shop. They noticed that, whenever they re-stocked the bird's feeder, it ate first all of a particular type of seed. But when they asked the shop owner if he could let them have just this type he said that, since the seeds were cannabis, he was unable to do so. </p> <p> <b>Geoffrey Taunton</b>, London E1. </p> <p> \u0095 It is more usual than we imagine. Cats are known for eating catnip, and researchers found out that its effects are similar to LSD in humans. Several species eat wild plants that have moderate hallucinogenic effects. More impressive are some monkeys in tropical forests. During the fruit season, they eat over-ripened fruits on the ground that, due to fermentation, have a mild alcoholic level. Some eat so much they get drunk. </p> <p>But animals do not look for \"recreational\" drugs only. Wounded animals look for specific plants that researchers have shown to have anti-inflammatory or antibiotic properties. Plant-eating cats and dogs often have parasitic infections. It is possible that early human beings learned how to use medicinal (and hallucinogenic) plants by observing animals. </p> <p> <b>Karin von Schmalz-Peixoto</b>, Animal behaviour research group, University of Oxford.</p> <p><b>My wife, as a schoolgirl before the war in Wensleydale, North Yorks, recalls reciting the lines: \"29th of May, Royal Oak Day, if you don't give us a holiday, we'll all run away.\" Why should this memory of the 17th-century civil war persist in children's doggerel? Is this a specifically regional memory?</b> </p> <p> \u0095 I am 91, and as a small child in a north Yorkshire village (Hensall) I remember well the Royal Oak Day custom. Until 12 noon on that day, we girls had to wear a sprig of oak to prevent us being chased by the boys carrying nettles with which they tormented us! </p> <p> <b>Elsie Edmundson</b>, Upminster, Essex. </p> <p> \u0095 I chanted the same rhyme in the Lancashire village of Mawdesley before the war. The children wore a spray of oak leaves - green for Protestants, a reddish colour for Catholics. My husband, then in the nearby village of Skelmersdale, remembers the same custom, except that the different colours had no significance. </p> <p><b> Joan Sockett</b>, Skelmersdale, Lancs. </p> <p> \u0095 May 29 was celebrated in Northamptonshire, but known there as Oak Apple Day. The book Like Dew Before the Sun - Life and Language in Northamptonshire, by Dorothy Grimes, states: \"On May 29, 1660, Charles Stuart re-entered London after the ending of the Commonwealth . . . Oak Apple Day recalls this event and also the time when Charles was forced to hide in an oak tree after his defeat at the battle of Worcester in 1651. When Northampton was rebuilt after the Great Fire of 1675, the king gave a thousand tons of timber, including oak, from his forests of Whittlebury and Salcey. His statue, standing above the portico of All Saints Church in the centre of the town, is crowned with a garland on Oak Apple Day.\" </p> <p>As far as I know this custom is still observed. In the same book, a Miss Jessie Curtis remembers: \"We used to dance the Shutlanger Clap Dance . . . on Oak Apple Day.\" Shutlanger is a village in the old Whittlebury Forest. </p> <p><b> Bob Floyd</b>, Milngavie, Glasgow. </p> <p> <b> I have no kneejerk reflex. But despite doctors' failure to find one, none has suggested there is anything wrong with me, sent me to a specialist or offered an explanation. So what is the point of the test?</b> </p> <p> \u0095 The kneejerk is one of the fastest and most primitive in the body: it uses only two nerve cells via the spinal cord, and does not use the brain. However, the brain does preset the strength of the reflex. If the questioner interlaces her fingers and strains to pull her hands apart, tapping her knee will elicit a brisk reflex (because the brain thinks she is carrying a heavy load and needs extra support if she stumbles). If the brain or its connections are damaged - for example by a stroke - the reflex will be uncontrolled and grotesquely huge in the knee opposite the damaged side. This is what doctors look for. So the questioner's brain is working fine! </p> <p><b> Dr Anthony Carr</b>, McMaster University, Ontario, Canada. </p> <p> <b> Recently the Russian forces in Chechnya used \"vacuum bombs\". What are they, how do they work, and has Britain ever used them?</b> </p> <p> \u0095 Fuel-air explosives, popularly known in Russia as \"vacuum bombs\", are weapons that use an initial explosive charge to burst open and disperse a container of liquid fuel before a second explosive charge detonates the resulting fuel/air mix. The cloud of fuel penetrates structures and flows around objects so that when it is detonated, massive enveloping blast waves are created. If multiple warheads are deployed the different blast waves reinforce each other, increasing their destructive power. The effect, enhanced in buildings and enclosed spaces, can be up to 16 times more destructive than conventional high explosives.

      "bodyText": "I once caught my cat eating my cannabis plants. He loved them, and after a few munches fell over and went to sleep. He has never eaten any of my other houseplants. Is it normal for animals to take naturally occurring drugs? \u0095 During the hot summer of 1976, one of my student housemates succeeded in growing two cannabis plants about eight feet high in our terrace backyard. Our cat loved standing on the adjacent fence and nibbling the leaves, after which she would sit on the fence - in a state that can only be described as \"spaced out\" - until she recovered enough to step daintily along the fence for another helping. None of the other cats in our house, or locally, showed any similar interest. Mary Gibbs, Rusholme, Manchester. \u0095 In the mid-1970s, our English setter pup dug up our lodger's dope stash, which he had buried in the garden. We returned from work to find the pup prostrate on the lawn with a glazed expression in his eyes. He recovered after a couple of hours and seemed none the worse for the experience. Indeed, he must have enjoyed it. From then on, he would seek it out dope at every opportunity, showing great enthusiasm and affection for anyone carrying any. Is this how the police train their sniffer dogs? Bob Newbury, Jersey. \u0095 French friends of mine keep a canary, which they feed on mixed seeds bought from the local pet shop. They noticed that, whenever they re-stocked the bird's feeder, it ate first all of a particular type of seed. But when they asked the shop owner if he could let them have just this type he said that, since the seeds were cannabis, he was unable to do so. Geoffrey Taunton, London E1. \u0095 It is more usual than we imagine. Cats are known for eating catnip, and researchers found out that its effects are similar to LSD in humans. Several species eat wild plants that have moderate hallucinogenic effects. More impressive are some monkeys in tropical forests. During the fruit season, they eat over-ripened fruits on the ground that, due to fermentation, have a mild alcoholic level. Some eat so much they get drunk. But animals do not look for \"recreational\" drugs only. Wounded animals look for specific plants that researchers have shown to have anti-inflammatory or antibiotic properties. Plant-eating cats and dogs often have parasitic infections. It is possible that early human beings learned how to use medicinal (and hallucinogenic) plants by observing animals. Karin von Schmalz-Peixoto, Animal behaviour research group, University of Oxford. My wife, as a schoolgirl before the war in Wensleydale, North Yorks, recalls reciting the lines: \"29th of May, Royal Oak Day, if you don't give us a holiday, we'll all run away.\" Why should this memory of the 17th-century civil war persist in children's doggerel? Is this a specifically regional memory? \u0095 I am 91, and as a small child in a north Yorkshire village (Hensall) I remember well the Royal Oak Day custom. Until 12 noon on that day, we girls had to wear a sprig of oak to prevent us being chased by the boys carrying nettles with which they tormented us! Elsie Edmundson, Upminster, Essex. \u0095 I chanted the same rhyme in the Lancashire village of Mawdesley before the war. The children wore a spray of oak leaves - green for Protestants, a reddish colour for Catholics. My husband, then in the nearby village of Skelmersdale, remembers the same custom, except that the different colours had no significance. Joan Sockett, Skelmersdale, Lancs. \u0095 May 29 was celebrated in Northamptonshire, but known there as Oak Apple Day. The book Like Dew Before the Sun - Life and Language in Northamptonshire, by Dorothy Grimes, states: \"On May 29, 1660, Charles Stuart re-entered London after the ending of the Commonwealth . . . Oak Apple Day recalls this event and also the time when Charles was forced to hide in an oak tree after his defeat at the battle of Worcester in 1651. When Northampton was rebuilt after the Great Fire of 1675, the king gave a thousand tons of timber, including oak, from his forests of Whittlebury and Salcey. His statue, standing above the portico of All Saints Church in the centre of the town, is crowned with a garland on Oak Apple Day.\" As far as I know this custom is still observed. In the same book, a Miss Jessie Curtis remembers: \"We used to dance the Shutlanger Clap Dance . . . on Oak Apple Day.\" Shutlanger is a village in the old Whittlebury Forest. Bob Floyd, Milngavie, Glasgow. I have no kneejerk reflex. But despite doctors' failure to find one, none has suggested there is anything wrong with me, sent me to a specialist or offered an explanation. So what is the point of the test? \u0095 The kneejerk is one of the fastest and most primitive in the body: it uses only two nerve cells via the spinal cord, and does not use the brain. However, the brain does preset the strength of the reflex. If the questioner interlaces her fingers and strains to pull her hands apart, tapping her knee will elicit a brisk reflex (because the brain thinks she is carrying a heavy load and needs extra support if she stumbles). If the brain or its connections are damaged - for example by a stroke - the reflex will be uncontrolled and grotesquely huge in the knee opposite the damaged side. This is what doctors look for. So the questioner's brain is working fine! Dr Anthony Carr, McMaster University, Ontario, Canada. Recently the Russian forces in Chechnya used \"vacuum bombs\". What are they, how do they work, and has Britain ever used them? \u0095 Fuel-air explosives, popularly known in Russia as \"vacuum bombs\", are weapons that use an initial explosive charge to burst open and disperse a container of liquid fuel before a second explosive charge detonates the resulting fuel/air mix. The cloud of fuel penetrates structures and flows around objects so that when it is detonated, massive enveloping blast waves are created. If multiple warheads are deployed the different blast waves reinforce each other, increasing their destructive power. The effect, enhanced in buildings and enclosed spaces, can be up to 16 times more destructive than conventional high explosives. The term \"vacuum bomb\" probably comes from the vacuum that occurs after the initial blast wave. It is this pressure effect that makes the weapon deadly even to people hiding in shelters. In addition, the most commonly used fuels are themselves highly toxic, so even if the fuel cloud fails to detonate, people caught in it will more than likely be killed. Fuel-air explosives were first developed by the US and were used in Vietnam. James McCreery, London W6. \u0095 The US, Russia and China are all known to possess fuel-air explosives and others have at least displayed an interest. Not all FAEs are for offensive purposes. The technology is also used in mine-clearance, with the blast overpressure being used to detonate buried devices. Marc Arnold, Jane's Information Group, Coulsdon, Surrey. How did captains of ships develop the tradition of going down with their vessel; is there any sense in it and, given the value of experienced seamen in a war, has the Navy ever issued orders forbidding it? \u0095 This probably lies in salvage law. The captain, colloquially, is \"the Owner\", and is the owner's representative in law. As long as he is on board, the salvors cannot take the cargo, so he often stayed till it was too late to get off. Besides, most traditional sailors were non-swimmers and did not bother to learn because the odds of dying of exposure, exhaustion and sharks were shorter than those of rescue. In the navy - besides Admiral Byng, shot \"to encourage the others\" - until the 20th century there were enough routine courts martial on the loss of ships to make sure captains tried to save the ship till the last moment possible. Ships have always been expensive beasts. Frank Adam, Prestwich, Manchester. Any answers? In the novel The Devil Rides Out, Dennis Wheatley refers to the \"Sussamma Ritual\" - the only one of his mythological references I have been unable to track down. Was it made up by the author? Stephen Bailey, Sutton, Surrey. Is there any proof that homeopathic medicine works? J Burgess, Norwich. Among our small garden birds, some hop, some walk, and some do both. Why? Is there an advantage for a particular sort of bird to use a particular gait? Anthony Bullock, Southfield, Glos. Why are some countries, such as The Gambia, prefixed with \"The\", even when they are not plural (like The Netherlands). Nicholas Beare, Blantyre, Malawi. Why do wasps and bees hover outside windows trying to get in, then hover inside trying to get out? Morag Christie, Sherwood, Notts. Why did the Elizabethan theatre invariably begin performances at 3pm? In the summer, shows could have started at 7pm and still have seen enough daylight. Were audiences reluctant to be out in the town in the evening? John Hole, London SE10.",

      "body": "<p>The first thing that strikes you when you meet David McAlmont is the obvious, distressing sign of self-abuse. No, not track marks or sunken cheeks or missing bits of nose. He looks perfectly cool and healthy and grown-up in his downbeat black clothes. The shocking thing is what he is doing to his precious vocal cords. He's smoking , for God's sake! \"It amazes me as well,\" says McAlmont. \"I've tried to stop but I actually don't want to. I'm at the point where I'm thinking, well, I'll take the risk. You only live once, c'est la vie, here today, gone tomorrow, blah blah blah. A-huh a-huh!\" </p> <p>That is the McAlmont laugh - a slow, deep, slightly dirty laugh that seems to sum up where the Nigerian/Guyanan/British singer- songwriter is at present. Indeed, the quietly knowing guffaw and \"You only live once, blah blah blah\" philosophy are constant undercurrents on his forthcoming album Be, a surprisingly upbeat, radio-friendly, dance pop-embracing affair. The album further establishes his credentials as both an extraordinary soul singer and one of British pop's most chameleon-like performers. </p> <p>McAlmont's journey began a decade ago with the Cocteau Twins-like guitars and falsetto delirium of indie duo Thieves. His impact stemmed less from the hysterical vocals than from the hysterical dress sense. As the rest of indie Britain settled into its drab blokeishness, McAlmont was a vision in pineapple dreads and canary-yellow blouses, lipsticked mouth spraying out gay diva invective. The press loved the attitude, but it and the public were bewildered by the music. </p> <p>\"My early career coincided with me coming to terms with what I was,\" he says. \"There was a joyous militancy about that, and I was a militant - loud 'n' proud, get a load of me - but I made my point, resoundingly. There's only so much of wearing a white frock that I can take! I suspect the music would have been better served by a less flamboyant personality.\" </p> <p>At that time the desperation to be a star seemed to ooze from him. Today he just seems like a guy. \"Oh, I've always been a guy - I just didn't dress like one,\" says McAlmont. \"I was dealing with issues. In my earlier life a lot of the men let me down, and the women closest to me got mistreated by them as well. I didn't have any man that I could really admire, that all-important figure a boy needs. But since then my faith in men has been restored and I've realised that a man is quite a cool thing to be. I've really gotten into that whole black Moses vibe. I like being concerned about my audience's spiritual needs. And I think Malcolm X specs and a small Afro are more becoming for that than peacock feathers. But it's a comfort thing as well. When you're glad-ragging the way I was, it's stressful. It's nice to walk down the street and not be looked at.\" </p> <p>If David has regrets about his pop beginnings, they are nothing compared with his lingering discomfort over phase two. From 1994 to 1995 he formed a partnership with ex-Suede guitarist Bernard Butler. On the plus side, it provided his only two proper hit singles, Yes and You Do, the relatively successful The Sound of McAlmont and Butler album, and his first taste of fame. On the minus, the break-up was acrimonious, with McAlmont publicly questioning Butler's attitude to homosexuality. </p> <p>\"I just behaved so badly,\" he recalls. \"I went to the Brit awards, took far too much cocaine, went to parties and met famous people and didn't think about how I was behaving.\" </p> <p>Looking at Butler's subsequent career - sober dadrock riffage, sessions with folk guitar legend Bert Jansch, a complete rejection of pop frontman frippery - it seems bizarre that there was ever a partnership at all. \"I don't think Bernard and I will be friends again because I was far too cruel,\" says McAlmont. \"He bugged me and, rather than use my common sense to sort it out, I took advantage of my position and conducted a deliberate, premeditated public annihilation of the guy. That's really embarrassing. I can't say it was unnecessary because I felt so strongly about it at the time, but would I do it now? Absolutely not. The problem is I've gone through a lot of my life not thinking about how people react to me.\" </p> <p>After a long break interrupted only by a couple of so-so singles, McAlmont returned with a drastic reinvention in 1998. A Little Communication remains the high point of his career to date - a low-key, overtly classic soul-influenced album about the pain and pleasure of a love affair. For the first time you could hear his voice in all its subtle glory - which in turn revealed a storyteller with an incisive eye. The critics raved but it didn't really sell - though it produced a significant change in his constantly shifting audience. </p> <p>\"I went travelling after McAlmont and Butler, and when I got back the first thing I did was go to my manager and say, 'I want a black band.' It was time. So I started auditioning and I had my fears, but the people I was meeting weren't paying any attention to my sexuality. I was with a group of black men who respected me for what I'm capable of, and other issues weren't important at all. I've realised that to define yourself as anything in particular is not the whole story. I'm Nigerian, Guyanan, British, I'm black, I'm a man. But at the start, these were not things I'd bang on about. It was always just the one thing. Obviously, I felt I needed to, but it didn't do me any favours. So suddenly this thing I'd been resisting for so long was happening, and it took me straight back to church. A Little Communication gave me a 50% black audience for the first time.\" </p> <p>Be carries a similar black sensibility but is deliberately light and radio- produced - more Macy Gray than Marvin Gaye. Its mature positivity is the result of McAlmont's new fascination with chaos theory and some vivid travel experiences - particularly in Madagascar - and it is probably Britain's first zen pop album. Its redemptive tone is encapsulated by the first single, Easy, a gently rippling drum'n'bass open letter to his parents, in which he seeks to mend a rift by taking his share of the blame. </p> <p>\"At times I've hated my parents,\" he says. \"But how could they not make mistakes when I've made so many? The song's about remembering what a nightmare I was as a kid, and realising that I was just another issue for them to deal with.\" </p> <p>Do they accept your sexuality? \"Well... um... once they know there's not a lot they can do... And it doesn't stop them loving you really. But, based on the information they have, I would argue that they actually have no choice but to react in whatever way they do.\" </p> <p>Unfortunately, though Easy is perfect for radio, one suspects that neither it nor any of the obvious singles on Be will get much airplay, perhaps because the music's charm and intelligence will throw the rest of daytime radio's shallow fodder into too sharp relief. </p> <p>But if McAlmont does get another pop at fame's bittersweet cherry... \"I'm gonna party like it's 1999,\" he says without a pause. \"And if it isn't, I'm still gonna party like it's 1999. Success has already changed me, but for the better. What I do now has pushed me to a deeper spiritual place and I wouldn't exchange it for more success. I remember the giddy heights of McAlmont and Butler and I wasn't ready. I made a complete arsehole of myself. I'd handle it now with dignity rather than running around screaming, 'Look at me - I'm fabulous!' \" </p> <p>\u0095 Easy is out now on Hut. Be will be released on September 4.</p>",

The problem is I've gone through a lot of my life not thinking about how people react to me.\" After a long break interrupted only by a couple of so-so singles, McAlmont returned with a drastic reinvention in 1998. A Little Communication remains the high point of his career to date - a low-key, overtly classic soul-influenced album about the pain and pleasure of a love affair. For the first time you could hear his voice in all its subtle glory - which in turn revealed a storyteller with an incisive eye. The critics raved but it didn't really sell - though it produced a significant change in his constantly shifting audience. \"I went travelling after McAlmont and Butler, and when I got back the first thing I did was go to my manager and say, 'I want a black band.' It was time. So I started auditioning and I had my fears, but the people I was meeting weren't paying any attention to my sexuality. I was with a group of black men who respected me for what I'm capable of, and other issues weren't important at all. I've realised that to define yourself as anything in particular is not the whole story. I'm Nigerian, Guyanan, British, I'm black, I'm a man. But at the start, these were not things I'd bang on about. It was always just the one thing. Obviously, I felt I needed to, but it didn't do me any favours. So suddenly this thing I'd been resisting for so long was happening, and it took me straight back to church. A Little Communication gave me a 50% black audience for the first time.\" Be carries a similar black sensibility but is deliberately light and radio- produced - more Macy Gray than Marvin Gaye. Its mature positivity is the result of McAlmont's new fascination with chaos theory and some vivid travel experiences - particularly in Madagascar - and it is probably Britain's first zen pop album. Its redemptive tone is encapsulated by the first single, Easy, a gently rippling drum'n'bass open letter to his parents, in which he seeks to mend a rift by taking his share of the blame. \"At times I've hated my parents,\" he says. \"But how could they not make mistakes when I've made so many? The song's about remembering what a nightmare I was as a kid, and realising that I was just another issue for them to deal with.\" Do they accept your sexuality? \"Well... um... once they know there's not a lot they can do... And it doesn't stop them loving you really. But, based on the information they have, I would argue that they actually have no choice but to react in whatever way they do.\" Unfortunately, though Easy is perfect for radio, one suspects that neither it nor any of the obvious singles on Be will get much airplay, perhaps because the music's charm and intelligence will throw the rest of daytime radio's shallow fodder into too sharp relief. But if McAlmont does get another pop at fame's bittersweet cherry... \"I'm gonna party like it's 1999,\" he says without a pause. \"And if it isn't, I'm still gonna party like it's 1999. Success has already changed me, but for the better. What I do now has pushed me to a deeper spiritual place and I wouldn't exchange it for more success. I remember the giddy heights of McAlmont and Butler and I wasn't ready. I made a complete arsehole of myself. I'd handle it now with dignity rather than running around screaming, 'Look at me - I'm fabulous!' \" \u0095 Easy is out now on Hut. Be will be released on September 4.",

      "body": "<p>Something most irregular is occurring in the world of pentagrams and pointy hats. After 2,000 years of persecution and bad publicity, witches have finally been rehabilitated as icons of female power.</p> <p>Don't believe me? Switch on the TV and there's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Sabrina the Teenage Witch acting as unofficial pagan ambassadors. Visit the New Age section of any bookstore and behold how the shelves are crammed with dozens of glossy tomes devoted to spells and magic. The bestselling of these, Hocus Pocus, a coffee-table guide for the apprentice sorcerer, has shifted a supernatural 150,000 copies in hardback. On the internet, e-covens and Wicca mailing lists are a growth area. A recent study by the University of Newcastle estimated there to be 50,000 practitioners of witchcraft in the UK, around 60% of them female.</p> <p>It is a curious phenomenon, this resurgence of interest in the dark arts, particularly among otherwise rational, 21st-century women. Is it a quest to reconnect with an authentic, intuitive inner goddess or another manifestation of an innate sense of powerlessness? Certainly the idea of being able to wave a magic wand over a particularly trying situation has great appeal; the thought that a spell might exist to turn a frog, if not into an actual prince, then into Dr Kovak from ER, is positively intoxicating.</p> <p>\"Women want more control over their lives, that's why they are turning to magic,\" claims Gillian Kemp, author of The Good Spell Book (Gollancz). \"All women are witches and everybody can do magic, simply by accessing their intuition,\" she insists. \"What makes a spell work is the emotion you put into it. So if someone wants to get their husband back, there isn't much point getting an official witch to do a spell - it's far better to do it yourself.\"</p> <p>This is where her book comes in handy, containing as it does spells to cover most of life's more pressing requirements, including To Get A Lover To Call, Eternal Triangle and (clearly designed with Euro 2000 in mind) To Communicate With An Absent Partner. There are also spells for avoiding divorce, dieting, finding a job and winning the lottery.</p> <p>My favourite was To Deter Straying, until I discovered it was a spell for pets and involved burying a lump of the animal's fur in a hole in the garden. Would it work as effectively if you used a clump of an errant spouse's hair? Kemp thinks not, but then the effectiveness of her enchantments is dubious to begin with. After all, why has she not won the lottery herself and retired by now? \"A spell is like a driving test,\" she says. \"They don't always work first time round. You need perseverance.\"</p> <p>With this in mind, I search for a suitable spell. The section on love looks promising, but they all seem to demand ingredients more appropriate for a forensics lab than a romantic encounter - lumps of hair, fingernails, clothing samples. If we had access to such intimate parts of our chosen love god, would we really need spells to entrap him anyway?</p> <p>Some of the incantations are a bit worrying, too. \"May the flame of passion burn within your heart/From me you will not part\" reads a spell To Attract the One You Love. But what if I get sick of him? Even the author admits her spell To Rid Yourself Of A Persistent And Unwanted Lover is \"more complicated than most\".</p> <p>Kate West heads the Hearth of Hecate, a coven in Norfolk with 20 members. She believes women are embracing \"the craft\" in droves, not because they need miracle spells but because they want to form more profound links to nature and their own unconscious. \"Ultimately it's about the belief that you can change the world around you - that's a nurturing, female concept. It is also liberating to accept that there is a goddess protecting us and our earth.\"</p> <p>Every week, West is inundated with requests for spells, or \"magical assistance\", and for advice, both from the local community and the internet. \"There isn't exactly a poster in the window saying Witch Lives Here, but people do know.

      "bodyText": "Something most irregular is occurring in the world of pentagrams and pointy hats. After 2,000 years of persecution and bad publicity, witches have finally been rehabilitated as icons of female power. Don't believe me? Switch on the TV and there's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Sabrina the Teenage Witch acting as unofficial pagan ambassadors. Visit the New Age section of any bookstore and behold how the shelves are crammed with dozens of glossy tomes devoted to spells and magic. The bestselling of these, Hocus Pocus, a coffee-table guide for the apprentice sorcerer, has shifted a supernatural 150,000 copies in hardback. On the internet, e-covens and Wicca mailing lists are a growth area. A recent study by the University of Newcastle estimated there to be 50,000 practitioners of witchcraft in the UK, around 60% of them female. It is a curious phenomenon, this resurgence of interest in the dark arts, particularly among otherwise rational, 21st-century women. Is it a quest to reconnect with an authentic, intuitive inner goddess or another manifestation of an innate sense of powerlessness? Certainly the idea of being able to wave a magic wand over a particularly trying situation has great appeal; the thought that a spell might exist to turn a frog, if not into an actual prince, then into Dr Kovak from ER, is positively intoxicating. \"Women want more control over their lives, that's why they are turning to magic,\" claims Gillian Kemp, author of The Good Spell Book (Gollancz). \"All women are witches and everybody can do magic, simply by accessing their intuition,\" she insists. \"What makes a spell work is the emotion you put into it. So if someone wants to get their husband back, there isn't much point getting an official witch to do a spell - it's far better to do it yourself.\" This is where her book comes in handy, containing as it does spells to cover most of life's more pressing requirements, including To Get A Lover To Call, Eternal Triangle and (clearly designed with Euro 2000 in mind) To Communicate With An Absent Partner. There are also spells for avoiding divorce, dieting, finding a job and winning the lottery. My favourite was To Deter Straying, until I discovered it was a spell for pets and involved burying a lump of the animal's fur in a hole in the garden. Would it work as effectively if you used a clump of an errant spouse's hair? Kemp thinks not, but then the effectiveness of her enchantments is dubious to begin with. After all, why has she not won the lottery herself and retired by now? \"A spell is like a driving test,\" she says. \"They don't always work first time round. You need perseverance.\" With this in mind, I search for a suitable spell. The section on love looks promising, but they all seem to demand ingredients more appropriate for a forensics lab than a romantic encounter - lumps of hair, fingernails, clothing samples. If we had access to such intimate parts of our chosen love god, would we really need spells to entrap him anyway? Some of the incantations are a bit worrying, too. \"May the flame of passion burn within your heart/From me you will not part\" reads a spell To Attract the One You Love. But what if I get sick of him? Even the author admits her spell To Rid Yourself Of A Persistent And Unwanted Lover is \"more complicated than most\". Kate West heads the Hearth of Hecate, a coven in Norfolk with 20 members. She believes women are embracing \"the craft\" in droves, not because they need miracle spells but because they want to form more profound links to nature and their own unconscious. \"Ultimately it's about the belief that you can change the world around you - that's a nurturing, female concept. It is also liberating to accept that there is a goddess protecting us and our earth.\" Every week, West is inundated with requests for spells, or \"magical assistance\", and for advice, both from the local community and the internet. \"There isn't exactly a poster in the window saying Witch Lives Here, but people do know. There's a lot of fear of us, particularly from men, but that has ever been the case. I get email from worried parents about daughters who have just got into magic.\" Now she is writing a handbook for young witches for the post-Harry Potter market, offering step-by-step guidance to becoming a witch. \"There are a lot of misconceptions.

Mr Morley, who is joining New Zealand and Australia in proposing a whale sanctuary for the South Pacific, said the Japanese plans \"fly in the face of world opinion\". The Japanese propose to kill 50 Brydes whales and 10 sperm whales in the Pacific this year - the first time the two species have been targeted since commercial whaling was banned in 1985. Sperm whales, the family of the fabled Moby-Dick, have the largest brains of any mammal and also the most valuable flesh. The Japanese eat the meat raw and will pay up to \u00a320 for a 100g slice in Tokyo restaurants for special parts of the rump. An ordinary whale steak is \u00a315.

Ever since he supposedly stumbled across Vanda griffithii in 1843 , the botanical community regarded Griffith's \"discovery\" with increasing scepticism. There was no trace of the purported specimen filed away in a dusty drawer at Kew Gardens and forgotten, and the orchid was never seen in the wild again. Until last month, when two botanists from Kew vindicated Griffith's work by finding his lost orchid growing on a tree. Phillip Cribb and Nicholas Pearce also found a genus of orchid new to botany - though not to local people - during their \"leech-ridden\" expedition to chart the world's last great unexplored forests at the request of the Bhutan government. Their findings will be published next year as part of a monumental study of Bhutan's flora which began in 1974. \"We found it growing 30km [18 miles] north of the Indian border on an oak,\" Dr Cribb said yesterday. \"It has fleshy leaves and purple and green flowers.\" Bhutan has little history of botanical exploration, and finding orchids is particularly difficult, because many grow epiphytically: in crevices high up in trees or on mossy rocks. \"Bhutan is an amazing jewel,\" Dr Pearce said. \"It has got some of the best-preserved forests in the world. They have not changed in thousands of years. And all of these trees are just covered with orchids.\" The forests have survived because, until recently, the small Buddhist state avoided almost all contact with foreigners.

Cultural change and the pace of modern life, together with a wrong but generally held belief that the fertility of the human race is declining, are causing couples to head for the clinics when there is no need, Egbert te Velde, head of the department of reproductive medicine at the University of Utrecht, told the conference.

There was a perception, he said, \"that fertility is not natural any more - that we should seek to get children as soon as possible and that our fertility may be impaired\". He spoke of a \"calculating society\" where every aspect of life was carefully planned. \"If everything is certain - the stable relationship, a good career and enough money, and a nice house - then the time is right for children, but then we are rushing. \"A lot of couples who have tried for six months give up, thinking it is not natural, and rush to do the fertility thing.

It will not be easy to generate \u00a3400m of extra income, but at least there is now a framework to make it possible and some money (in next month's spending review) to oil the wheels. Above all, the PO has now been given a more entrepreneurial role so it can view its vast network with different eyes. What used to be seen as a rotting asset it is now an opportunity. Some 94% of Britons live within a mile of a post office and two-thirds of town dwellers within half a mile of at least two. It is a delivery network that internet sellers would die for.",

      "body": "<p>Creating an accurate map of infinite, abstract cyberspace isn't the easiest task for cartographers. </p> <p>Cyberspace, of course, doesn't exist. It is, to paraphrase novelist William Gibson, a consensual hallucination of space and surface - our brains perceive space when we surf the net and communicate with other users around the planet, but what we perceive as space is actually binary code, buried in vast world-wide corridors of information. </p> <p>\"There's the screen, then that goes into the wire and then where is the rest of the internet? For most people it's just invisible. It's just under the road and in anonymous server rooms,\" says Martin Dodge, researcher at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at University College London. </p> <p>For three years, Dodge has curated his own cyber atlas online at <a href=\"http://www.cybergeography.org/atlas \">www.cybergeography.org/atlas </a> , a collection of maps of virtual space from a disparate group of researchers. </p> <p>Until recently, a lot of cybermapping has viewed computers as fixed points on a map, treating cyberspace as a tangible object anchored to the physical world by the networks and phone lines that form its backbone. </p> <p>But as the internet is moving away from the fixed to the fluid access model (the use of palm-top devices for internet access, for example), cybermappers are having to rethink the way virtual space is viewed. </p> <p>This is also changing our urban environments, the way we travel, the way we communicate, the way information is disseminated and the way we are targeted as consumers. </p> <p>\"The information landscape of the city is just as important as its transportation grid or housing stock, yet we understand very little about its actual shape and form,\" says Anthony Townsend, research scientist at Taub Urban Research Center, New York University. \"Such understanding is likely to radically reshape the way we plan and accommodate future growth and change in urban areas.\" </p> <p>As fluid-access penetrates further into the market, the computers plugged into the phone lines will stop being our gateway into the net as we ourselves - just by carrying our mobile phones - become the entry points. Just how are we to think about and visualise cyberspace when it is a morphing entity, its shape constantly affected by millions of fluid-access users, all moving in different directions and accessing cyberspace at different times and for different reasons? These questions pose some real problems for cyber mappers. </p> <p>\"In my mind it seems to be a real paradox,\" says Martin Dodge. \"Fluid access in one way is the dream that geography and location doesn't matter now, but the question everybody asks you when they ring is 'where are you?'. And the whole Wap thing seems to be about giving geography back to you - look at local navigational devices. Geography doesn't matter, and yet when people use mobile phones geography seems to matter even more.\" </p> <p>In one sense, this could mean that cybermapping may move away from abstraction towards becoming a very organic discipline indeed - as people become the entry points to cyberspace, surely maps of cyberspace will use people as landmarks? </p> <p>\"I see no technical reason why this is not possible,\" says Townsend. \"The challenges come from summarising so much information in a visually coherent way.\" </p> <p>And the nature of mobile devices means that mapping and tracking the individual is totally possible. </p> <p>\"It's a fantastic way to track people,\" agrees Dodge. \"If you're monitoring cellphone communications you see how pedestrians move and how traffic flows and how they live their daily lives. Potentially that is fantastic data.\" </p> <p>The kind of data that details the daily routine of every net-connected individual would be invaluable to businesses and marketers. A chain sushi restaurant, looking to open a branch in central London for example, could look at an animated cybermap of mobile internet users and pinpoint the location where most 19-25 A1 female office workers go for lunch. </p> <p>But this kind of information can also be a bad thing. \"It's a huge invasion of privacy, potentially,\" says Martin Dodge. \"The companies running the networks have valuable data - they've got your billing address, so they know your financial lifestyle and then they know your geographic lifestyle throughout the day. Huge implications. And I don't know if people are aware that is coming.\" </p> <p>It's a view shared by Townsend: \"A number of firms that already operate wireless data networks routinely monitor their customer's location. In the US, the E911 service will require wireless operators to be able to pinpoint the location of a mobile within a hundred metres or so. There is no doubt that once the necessary technology to implement this service is deployed, it will be used and resold by the wireless operator to third parties to target consumers based on their geographic location.\" </p> <p>Currently, mapping fluid-access cyberspace is still in its infancy. But the possibilities have been realised. It's only a matter of time before cartographers overcome the visual problems of mapping millions of people in flux and start creating crucial maps that aside from revolutionising marketing and commerce, will help us visualise and understand the way we live, interact and process information collectively.</p>",

It is, to paraphrase novelist William Gibson, a consensual hallucination of space and surface - our brains perceive space when we surf the net and communicate with other users around the planet, but what we perceive as space is actually binary code, buried in vast world-wide corridors of information. \"There's the screen, then that goes into the wire and then where is the rest of the internet? For most people it's just invisible. It's just under the road and in anonymous server rooms,\" says Martin Dodge, researcher at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at University College London. For three years, Dodge has curated his own cyber atlas online at www.cybergeography.org/atlas , a collection of maps of virtual space from a disparate group of researchers. Until recently, a lot of cybermapping has viewed computers as fixed points on a map, treating cyberspace as a tangible object anchored to the physical world by the networks and phone lines that form its backbone. But as the internet is moving away from the fixed to the fluid access model (the use of palm-top devices for internet access, for example), cybermappers are having to rethink the way virtual space is viewed. This is also changing our urban environments, the way we travel, the way we communicate, the way information is disseminated and the way we are targeted as consumers. \"The information landscape of the city is just as important as its transportation grid or housing stock, yet we understand very little about its actual shape and form,\" says Anthony Townsend, research scientist at Taub Urban Research Center, New York University. \"Such understanding is likely to radically reshape the way we plan and accommodate future growth and change in urban areas.\" As fluid-access penetrates further into the market, the computers plugged into the phone lines will stop being our gateway into the net as we ourselves - just by carrying our mobile phones - become the entry points. Just how are we to think about and visualise cyberspace when it is a morphing entity, its shape constantly affected by millions of fluid-access users, all moving in different directions and accessing cyberspace at different times and for different reasons? These questions pose some real problems for cyber mappers. \"In my mind it seems to be a real paradox,\" says Martin Dodge. \"Fluid access in one way is the dream that geography and location doesn't matter now, but the question everybody asks you when they ring is 'where are you?'. And the whole Wap thing seems to be about giving geography back to you - look at local navigational devices. Geography doesn't matter, and yet when people use mobile phones geography seems to matter even more.\" In one sense, this could mean that cybermapping may move away from abstraction towards becoming a very organic discipline indeed - as people become the entry points to cyberspace, surely maps of cyberspace will use people as landmarks? \"I see no technical reason why this is not possible,\" says Townsend. \"The challenges come from summarising so much information in a visually coherent way.\" And the nature of mobile devices means that mapping and tracking the individual is totally possible. \"It's a fantastic way to track people,\" agrees Dodge. \"If you're monitoring cellphone communications you see how pedestrians move and how traffic flows and how they live their daily lives. Potentially that is fantastic data.\" The kind of data that details the daily routine of every net-connected individual would be invaluable to businesses and marketers. A chain sushi restaurant, looking to open a branch in central London for example, could look at an animated cybermap of mobile internet users and pinpoint the location where most 19-25 A1 female office workers go for lunch. But this kind of information can also be a bad thing. \"It's a huge invasion of privacy, potentially,\" says Martin Dodge. \"The companies running the networks have valuable data - they've got your billing address, so they know your financial lifestyle and then they know your geographic lifestyle throughout the day. Huge implications. And I don't know if people are aware that is coming.\" It's a view shared by Townsend: \"A number of firms that already operate wireless data networks routinely monitor their customer's location. In the US, the E911 service will require wireless operators to be able to pinpoint the location of a mobile within a hundred metres or so. There is no doubt that once the necessary technology to implement this service is deployed, it will be used and resold by the wireless operator to third parties to target consumers based on their geographic location.\" Currently, mapping fluid-access cyberspace is still in its infancy. But the possibilities have been realised. It's only a matter of time before cartographers overcome the visual problems of mapping millions of people in flux and start creating crucial maps that aside from revolutionising marketing and commerce, will help us visualise and understand the way we live, interact and process information collectively.",

      "body": "<p><strong> You say in your book that machines will be able to \"perceive\" as well as remember and communicate. When? </strong> In principle they \"perceive\" now, in the sense that they have a mass of cells (neurons) which, as in certain parts of the brain, \"fire\" in patterns that are pretty much like the world which the \"eyes\" of the machine are sensing. We call this \"depiction\". When the machine is using its eyes, the depiction is accurate and allows movement or actions in the world to deal with the objects perceived. If the machine closes its eyes, it can, in a slightly fuzzy way, imagine worlds that it has sensed, and in this way plan its actions without actually taking them. These properties are in a totally embryonic state on our machines, but it should not take more than five or six years for this technology to become commonplace. </p> <p><strong> Will their success diminish the economic importance of human brains? </strong> Artificial perceptual systems are there to extend and enhance the economic importance of the human mind. They make machinery more compatible with, and therefore more useful, to human brains. The more we work with virtual brains and their attendant virtual minds, the more we stand back in awe of the real thing. What we learn is how the fabric of the brain supports mind - a vital element in the understanding of mental disorders so that human brains can maintain their economic importance as long as possible. </p> <p><strong> Will the internet be able to prolong people's conscious lives?</strong> The internet is there for human brains to communicate. However, as an aid to this communication, software agents could be created with artificial perceptual systems. They would act as good messengers between humans and computers. Sadly they will not be able to prolong life, but might help in old age where they could remind one of things that had been forgotten. </p> <p><strong> Will there still be a role for God? </strong> Concepts of God are not likely to be shifted by technological progress. The link between minds and God is largely a cultural one in the sense that Aristotle saw thinking as being the activity of a mortal that would get him or her as close to divinity as possible. The presence of a machine with a mind does not deny the belief that a real human mind is divinely endowed. </p> <p><strong> How do you use the internet in your daily work?</strong> The speed with which I can find people working in interesting fields and get in touch with them is revolutionising the way I do the groundwork for my research ( http://wos.mimas.ac.uk/ ).

      "bodyText": "You say in your book that machines will be able to \"perceive\" as well as remember and communicate. When? In principle they \"perceive\" now, in the sense that they have a mass of cells (neurons) which, as in certain parts of the brain, \"fire\" in patterns that are pretty much like the world which the \"eyes\" of the machine are sensing. We call this \"depiction\". When the machine is using its eyes, the depiction is accurate and allows movement or actions in the world to deal with the objects perceived. If the machine closes its eyes, it can, in a slightly fuzzy way, imagine worlds that it has sensed, and in this way plan its actions without actually taking them. These properties are in a totally embryonic state on our machines, but it should not take more than five or six years for this technology to become commonplace. Will their success diminish the economic importance of human brains? Artificial perceptual systems are there to extend and enhance the economic importance of the human mind. They make machinery more compatible with, and therefore more useful, to human brains. The more we work with virtual brains and their attendant virtual minds, the more we stand back in awe of the real thing. What we learn is how the fabric of the brain supports mind - a vital element in the understanding of mental disorders so that human brains can maintain their economic importance as long as possible. Will the internet be able to prolong people's conscious lives? The internet is there for human brains to communicate. However, as an aid to this communication, software agents could be created with artificial perceptual systems. They would act as good messengers between humans and computers. Sadly they will not be able to prolong life, but might help in old age where they could remind one of things that had been forgotten. Will there still be a role for God? Concepts of God are not likely to be shifted by technological progress. The link between minds and God is largely a cultural one in the sense that Aristotle saw thinking as being the activity of a mortal that would get him or her as close to divinity as possible. The presence of a machine with a mind does not deny the belief that a real human mind is divinely endowed. How do you use the internet in your daily work? The speed with which I can find people working in interesting fields and get in touch with them is revolutionising the way I do the groundwork for my research ( http://wos.mimas.ac.uk/ ). Specialist sites such as the Neuroguide are useful ( www.neuroguide.com/ ). I also use email, order books ( amazon.com ), check railway ( www.rail.co.uk/ ) and airline timetables ( travelstore.com ) on the net. What are your favourite web sites? www.FT.com, www.newscientist.com, www.bbc.co.uk, The London Symphony Orchestra and Real Player. \u0095 Professor Alexsander's new book, How To Build A Mind (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, \u00a314.99) is published today",

I was appalled to discover on checking with them that the fraudster who had been using my credit card details had been able to join numerous \"adult\" web sites while managing to mistype my name (NOLBE instead of NOBLE) and give a fictitious address and post code that bore no resemblance to the billing address for my card (no, I tell a lie, it had UK in it). </p> <p>This does not give me a warm secure feeling about doing further business on the web.

I have listened to the MS7 through some very expensive Linn speakers, and also through my home-cinema setup and I can't question the quality. While it is not CD-quality, it is far superior to a standard recording on audio cassette.

By 2004 it will only be a third, according to Barry Parr, a senior analyst at the San Francisco-based International Data Corporation, and two-thirds of all internet spending will then be outside the United States. </p> <p>\"Because nearly 80% of Americans will be online, there is simply more opportunity for growth outside the US,\" he says. </p> <p>Cisco - also from San Francisco - supplies most of the communications equipment that runs the net, and its television advertisements show it knows what's going on. The ads present a series of children from around the world asking the same question: \"Are you ready?\" </p> <p>They aren't. In fact, IDC's research shows that more than half the US sites surveyed are doing nothing to internationalise their sites, and this could threaten their future. Another American company, Forrester Research, says leading American websites now turn away almost half of the orders that originate outside the US, and that three-quarters of the sites aren't designed to handle non-US addresses or work out shipping costs. </p> <p>\"Businesses that don't begin preparing today could find themselves outflanked by their more internationally-oriented competitors,\" Parr argues. </p> <p>Of course, some are already well advanced. <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\" target=\"_new\">Yahoo!</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.msn.com\" target=\"_mew\">Microsoft Network (MSN)</a> and a few others have been globalising their businesses for three or four years. As a result they are among the top five sites visited by home users in many different countries, judged by the number of unique visitors per month, according to Media Metrix, an audience measurement company based in New York. In its first multi-country survey, released this month, MSN took the top spot in Australia and Canada while Yahoo! came top in the UK and Japan. </p> <p>But local websites are also appearing at or very near the top of the charts: examples include <a href=\"http://www.Freeserve.com\" target=\"_new\">Freeserve</a> in the UK, T-Online in Germany, Wanadoo in France, and AtNifty in Japan. Both Yahoo! and MSN are competing by making their local offerings as local as possible, and Yahoo! now also has operations in 20 countries including Brazil, China, Denmark, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Norway, Singapore and Taiwan. </p> <p>Jerry Yang, a co-founder of Yahoo! and himself born in Taiwan, says: \"Our goal is get local when the growth starts to happen, and in Western Europe we think it's going to happen in the next year. It's already happening in Japan, where we have a 100% Japanese site. I would say it's probably the most important corporate priority for us to be truly global, but to do it in a way that allows local control of content, the product, and the flavour and culture. It's tough to do. Most media companies aren't that local. It's exciting and daunting at the same time. </p> <p>\"My belief is that, probably not too far in the future, very few people will care about American content, they will only care about local content. This is not like Disney movies. I think delivering internet communications, content and services is about creating somewhere where you belong, which is primarily something that's in your neighbourhood, not in California. Just having local content is not enough, right? But if you don't have a rich offering that's part of people's lives 24 hours a day - which is extremely local - then I don't think you'll be successful.\" </p> <p>\"Everybody talks about it, very few people really do it,\" says Dan Pelson, president and chief executive of Bolt, which is based in New York and has just opened a UK site. He has even coined a term for it: \"glocalisation\". But Pelson reckons that, in the long term, the global market for Bolt's chat sites, targeted at teens aged 15-20, is huge. \"Just think,\" he exclaims: \"40% of India will be under 20. There will be more people in our demographic than there are people in the US!\" </p> <p>India, China and other massive populations may be slow to come on to the net, but usage is already exploding in Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. These are countries with young populations, and they are also centres of PC production, where people can easily assemble their own machines from parts. </p> <p>In South Korea, for example, the number of internet users leapt from 3.4 million in February 1999 to 15.3 million in May 2000, according to Korea's Network Information Centre, KRNIC ( http://stat.nic. or.kr/english/public_html/iuser. html ). With a third of the population online, Korea went to the top of Network Solutions' monthly chart for new dot.com name registrations outside the US, and Seoul was the top city ahead of Hong Kong and London (<a href=\"http://www.nsol.com/statistics\">www.nsol.com/statistics</a>). When I was there, I saw more website addresses prominently displayed in tube and television advertisements and shop windows than in either Singapore or London. </p> <p>But the globalisation of the internet brings with it a problem that was amusingly highlighted by Professor Nicholas Negroponte, founder and director of the MIT Media Lab, at an IDC conference in Paris last September. \"One day we're going to wake up and say, 'Oh my god, I didn't realise that Spanish was the second biggest language on the internet... after Chinese'.\" </p> <p>Today, most people are happy to do their websurfing in English, even when it's their second language. According to IDC's Project Atlas II, which polled 29,000 internet users around the world, 72% currently prefer to surf in English, though the proportion falls from 97% in the US to 48% in western Europe, 25% in Latin America and only 16% in Japan. </p> <p>However, IDC predicts that the number who prefer English will fall to 64% by 2003, and Parr argues that \"as the net becomes less of a tool of the elite and more commonplace, the population of non-English-speakers will grow even faster.\" </p> <p>Translating websites into local languages could soon become an enormous problem - and an enormous business for machine translation companies such as Lernout &amp; Hauspie, Systran and eTranslate. </p> <p>Kevin Lim, vice president of L&amp;H's Asia Pacific subsidiary in Singapore, says that today more than 70% of internet content is in English but more than 80% of the world's population are not native English speakers. To tackle the problem, L&amp;H has research teams in Korea, Singapore and Japan working on speech recognition (speech to text), language translation (text to text) and voice generation (text to speech). The results are not as good as human translation, which L&amp;H also offers, but machine translation is very cheap and very fast. </p> <p>\"Our first priority is really delivering three languages - Japanese, Korean and Mandarin Chinese - with Tamil, Hindi, Malay and Thai to follow,\" Lim says. \"Cantonese is on the roadmap as well. But there are 205 active spoken languages in China alone, and 15 national languages in India.\" </p> <p>Obviously L&amp;H, a Belgian company, is not creating products solely for internet use. However, Lim believes speech will become the most common way of accessing the net in the Asia Pacific region. He points out that keyboards were not designed to input Asian languages, and that it's much more natural to use a speech recognition system. </p> <p>Lim also argues that mobile phones are already more common than PCs in many regions. \"In the USA,\" he says, quoting figures from Ericsson, \"there's one mobile phone for every four PCs, whereas in China, there are 10 mobile phones for every PC!\" The lack of an established telecommunications structure will, he thinks, enable some Asia Pacific countries to leapfrog the west by rapidly adopting mobile phones and wireless organisers for internet access. </p> <p> China has only 12.3 million internet users, less than 1% of its 1.3 billion population, according to recent research by Hong Kong-based Iamasia (Interactive Audience Measurement Asia). Many of those have access only through universities and cybercafes. The potential for growth is enormous, but may also depend on a more liberal political climate. However, it would be hypocritical to criticise China when the UK is planning to trample human rights underfoot in forcing through an e-commerce killer, the RIP (Regulation of Investigatory Powers) Bill. </p> <p>But while imagining the internet of the near future as multi-lingual, multi-cultural, mobile and truly global, don't count out the Americans yet. They still have the economic power and own most of the big brands on the net. </p> <p>An unofficial policy discussion group, the Global Business Dialogue on Electronic Commerce, which held a conference in New York in April, reckoned that 85% of the revenue from internet businesses goes to American companies, and 95% of the stock market value of internet properties is held by American companies. </p> <p>Sooner or later they will feel the need to expand in a hurry, and because \"no company can expand into all markets at once,\" as Parr says, they'll do it by acquisition. IDC is therefore predicting \"a wave of global mergers\", and it's not hard to imagine Yahoo!, AOL, eBay, Amazon and other American giants doing most of the buying. </p> <p>In other words, the globalisation of the internet could turn out much like the globalisation of the computer business, which is now worth $2 trillion a year. Like the net, the computer industry started in the US, but there was a flowering of overseas suppliers before American companies such as IBM, Digital Equipment Corp, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq and Dell became multi-national operations and squeezed out most of the local competition.</p>",

However, IDC predicts that the number who prefer English will fall to 64% by 2003, and Parr argues that \"as the net becomes less of a tool of the elite and more commonplace, the population of non-English-speakers will grow even faster.\" Translating websites into local languages could soon become an enormous problem - and an enormous business for machine translation companies such as Lernout &amp; Hauspie, Systran and eTranslate. Kevin Lim, vice president of L&amp;H's Asia Pacific subsidiary in Singapore, says that today more than 70% of internet content is in English but more than 80% of the world's population are not native English speakers. To tackle the problem, L&amp;H has research teams in Korea, Singapore and Japan working on speech recognition (speech to text), language translation (text to text) and voice generation (text to speech). The results are not as good as human translation, which L&amp;H also offers, but machine translation is very cheap and very fast. \"Our first priority is really delivering three languages - Japanese, Korean and Mandarin Chinese - with Tamil, Hindi, Malay and Thai to follow,\" Lim says. \"Cantonese is on the roadmap as well. But there are 205 active spoken languages in China alone, and 15 national languages in India.\" Obviously L&amp;H, a Belgian company, is not creating products solely for internet use. However, Lim believes speech will become the most common way of accessing the net in the Asia Pacific region. He points out that keyboards were not designed to input Asian languages, and that it's much more natural to use a speech recognition system. Lim also argues that mobile phones are already more common than PCs in many regions. \"In the USA,\" he says, quoting figures from Ericsson, \"there's one mobile phone for every four PCs, whereas in China, there are 10 mobile phones for every PC!\" The lack of an established telecommunications structure will, he thinks, enable some Asia Pacific countries to leapfrog the west by rapidly adopting mobile phones and wireless organisers for internet access. China has only 12.3 million internet users, less than 1% of its 1.3 billion population, according to recent research by Hong Kong-based Iamasia (Interactive Audience Measurement Asia). Many of those have access only through universities and cybercafes. The potential for growth is enormous, but may also depend on a more liberal political climate. However, it would be hypocritical to criticise China when the UK is planning to trample human rights underfoot in forcing through an e-commerce killer, the RIP (Regulation of Investigatory Powers) Bill. But while imagining the internet of the near future as multi-lingual, multi-cultural, mobile and truly global, don't count out the Americans yet. They still have the economic power and own most of the big brands on the net. An unofficial policy discussion group, the Global Business Dialogue on Electronic Commerce, which held a conference in New York in April, reckoned that 85% of the revenue from internet businesses goes to American companies, and 95% of the stock market value of internet properties is held by American companies. Sooner or later they will feel the need to expand in a hurry, and because \"no company can expand into all markets at once,\" as Parr says, they'll do it by acquisition. IDC is therefore predicting \"a wave of global mergers\", and it's not hard to imagine Yahoo!, AOL, eBay, Amazon and other American giants doing most of the buying. In other words, the globalisation of the internet could turn out much like the globalisation of the computer business, which is now worth $2 trillion a year. Like the net, the computer industry started in the US, but there was a flowering of overseas suppliers before American companies such as IBM, Digital Equipment Corp, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq and Dell became multi-national operations and squeezed out most of the local competition.",
