      "body": "<p>It is sport's mission impossible: to save the troubled redevelopment of Wembley Stadium from its perpetual crisis and finally produce a world-class sporting arena of which a nation can be proud. Wembley's 12 directors will meet this Friday to decide if it can be done. The omens are not good. Whatever they decide, someone or something important - football, sports fans, the Twin Towers beneath which Bobby Moore led England to World Cup glory in 1966, England's national honour and worldwide reputation, athletics, the Government and Britain's chances of ever again hosting the Olympic Games - will lose out. It is an unenviable task. </p> <p>Wembley's bosses will try to draw a line under the past, the endless setbacks, delays and bitter rows which have plagued the project since its inception in the early 1990s. They must somehow stop the rebuilding of Wembley from looking any further like sport's equivalent of the Millennium Dome fiasco, a wretched combination of unfulfilled dreams, broken promises and questionable use of Lottery money. </p> <p>The dream in Wembley's case was the grand vision of Ken Bates, the opinionated and intensely strong-minded chairman of both Chelsea football club and Wembley National Stadium Limited. He wanted the new Wembley to be not just the best sports stadium in the world - the scale and verve of Sir Norman Foster and HOK-Lobb's July 1999 blueprint were certainly stunning - but something else, too. Bates decided it could also be a thriving, all-year-round, profit-making commercial centre complete with hotel, offices and restaurants. Nothing on that scale has been tried before, except by Bates himself at Chelsea Village. But swanky Kensington is not the same as rundown suburban north London. From the outset critics said Bates's plan was grandiose, unworkable and dangerously experimental. But nobody listened. </p> <p>Ironically, Friday's crucial meeting will be held at the Chelsea Village Hotel. Around the table will be directors of WNSL who privately regard Bates's tenure as Wembley chairman as little short of disastrous. He was demoted from that position 12 days ago when, after two years of inaction, the Football Association, which owns WNSL, belatedly took control of a project which, under Bates's leadership, was set to cost an incredible \u00a3660 million. WNSL's directors must decide this week whether to simply scale down the Bates-Foster plan in an attempt to slash up to \u00a3100m from that, or to throw it out altogether and come up with a new plan for a Wembley Mark III. </p> <p>Their deliberations will be based on a document, seen by The Observer , which outlines four possible ways out of the mess. The good news is that WNSL has options. The bad news is that none of the four is truly satisfactory, much less attractive. The paper, prepared by Wembley's managing director Bob Stubbs, warns in stark terms that each of the four involves risks, problems and uncomfortable compromises. </p> <p>Whatever WNSL decides, renewed controversy is guaranteed. Yet WNSL seems set to choose one of them, or something very like it, rather than radically rethink the whole Wembley concept. Under pressure to sort out the mess, they may make yet another unwise decision. </p> <p>According to the document, further lengthy delays to the new stadium's reopening date - spring 2004 is the latest estimate - are inevitable. It says the closure period which began after England's 1-0 defeat by Germany at Wembley on 7 October could stretch into 2005, 2006 or even, under one option, autumn 2007. The only option which involves sticking to 2004, number one, is almost certainly a non-starter. </p> <p>Beside the other problems confronting WNSL, though, that is trivial. Three of the four would apparently require new designs to be drawn up and fresh planning permission to be sought from Brent Council. Having been promised a world-class, 90,000-seater, brand new stadium that would renovate the surrounding area, Brent may withhold approval for a pale imitation which is, of necessity, being done on the cheap. </p> <p>The capacity of whatever new structure eventually replaces Wembley is another huge problem. How many fans can attend is crucial to the chances of staging European football finals and the stadium's future profitability. If WNSL decide to simply renovate the existing stadium, option four, 'capacity may be limited to 55,000' instead of the existing 78,000, the paper warns. The maximum possible capacity, 65,000, could only be achieved by installing a new, deeper pitch and putting seats over the unused wide area which currently separates the crowd from the playing area. That seems a non-starter. </p> <p>Even with option three, which alongside number two is the alternative likeliest to gain WNSL support, capacity would shrink from the promised 90,000 to 80,000. Fewer fans would be able to attend big events such as FA Cup Finals and England games, and the FA would lose vital revenue. As the document makes clear, building a slimmed-down, 80,000-seat Wembley 'may have an impact on the ability to attract certain events and will therefore influence the revenue which can be generated by the project'. The prestigious and lucrative European Cup and Uefa Cup Finals may never be held there. </p> <p>The paper's executive summary also warns that if construction of a new stadium has not begun by December 2002, ownership of the land on which Wembley sits - bought with \u00a3103 million Lottery cash for WNSL - would revert to its previous owners, Wembley London Limited. It may seem inconceivable that rebuilding will take that long. Yet the options paper points out that two of the four alternatives - including the 80,000-capacity option - would mean construction could not start until autumn 2003. </p> <p>It also highlights other obstacles to speedy progress. English Heritage may refuse permission to demolish the existing stadium, which is listed, because its replacement is not of sufficient architectural merit. And WNSL could have to pay back its entire \u00a3120 million Lottery grant because it has not, after all, built anything like what it always promised - the best sports stadium in the world. </p> <p>Under the leadership of 'new broom' chief executive Adam Crozier, the FA now realises that Bates's attempt to transplant Chelsea Village II into rundown, suburban north London was a hideously expensive pipedream. It was only because City banks refused to lend a penny of the \u00a3410 million being sought by the Bates-led WNSL that the FA earlier this month finally got a grip on a scheme which, if WNSL gets it wrong, could still become even more disastrous. </p> <p>With so much time having already been wasted, WNSL is under huge pressure to signal a fresh start and clear leadership. At Friday's meeting, they will probably rule out options one and four and concentrate on examining options two and three in detail. The likeliest eventual outcome is a new football arena, rather than truly multi-sport national stadium like those in Paris and Sydney, which costs much less than Bates envisaged. If WNSL go down that road, time may show that its directors - under pressure to somehow sort out the mess - acted unwisely, and in haste. </p> <p>Influential figures in British sport think fresh ideas are required and ask other, more drastic questions - why not build the new Wembley on a greenfield site, and not necessarily in London? Three possible locations have already been identified. And, most radically, do we need to replace Wembley at all? Those, though, are not on the agenda. </p> <p><strong> OPTION 1 </strong></p> <p><strong>Stick with the current design for a new stadium but delay fitting out the hotel, offices, visitor attraction, two restaurants and one fast-food outlet until tenants are found... </strong></p> <p>New planning permission would not be needed, so no extra delays. The stadium could open on time in spring 2004. It would be truly world-class and get a five-star rating from European football's ruling body. But it would save only \u00a324.5m. And why build something that may never be occupied? Brainchild of Ken Bates, recently ousted as Wembley's chairman. </p> <p><strong> OPTION 2 </strong> </p> <p><strong>Don't build any of the 'non-core activity areas' - hotel, offices and so on...</strong> </p> <p>A public relations fiasco. The stadium wouldn't open until early 2005. It would save only \u00a33m - too little to bother with? WNSL says this option would require a new design and fresh planning permission, which would take a year. But Brent council may well not insist on that. </p> <p><strong>OPTION 3</strong></p> <p><strong>A totally new but smaller-capacity stadium, which may or may not include athletics... </strong> </p> <p>A public relations disaster. Only 80,000, rather than the promised 90,000, fans would fit inside. Would need new planning permission and so wouldn't open until early 2006 - two years behind schedule. May not be good enough to host the European or Uefa Cup Finals. Would be hard to upgrade later. But could possibly host major athletics events like the Olympic Games - and would save \u00a3121.5million at the same time. </p> <p> <strong> OPTION 4 </strong></p> <p><strong> Renovate the existing stadium...</strong> </p> <p>A public relations catastrophe. Norman Foster's design would be torn up. The Football Association, and England, would be ridiculed mercilessly. Capacity would shrink from the existing 78,000 to just 55,000 or at most 65,000 if a new, deeper pitch were installed. Wembley would stay closed until autumn 2007 - 27 months late. And it would not be world class - a new humiliation. The revamped stadium couldn't host European finals or athletics. Would save \u00a370m. All in all, unthinkable, surely?</p>",

      "body": "<p>One of the perils of success is the desire of others to bring you down a peg or two, and Bolton manager Sam Allardyce will know all about that after seeing West Bromwich Albion spoil his New Year celebrations. </p> <p>The talk before the game surrounded Bolton's decision to hand manager Allardyce a new 10-year contract. Allardyce agreed to sign the mammoth deal on New Year's Day, but rarely can a football club have bestowed such extraordinary faith in their manager. </p> <p>Bolton will know that much can happen during a decade in football. Ten years ago, they were fighting a losing battle to escape the old Third Division, but since those dark days, Wanderers have twice scaled the heights of the Premiership, been to Wembley for a League Cup Final and narrowly missed out on an FA Cup Final appearance. </p> <p>Ten years ago, Sir Alex Ferguson was still searching for his first championship at Manchester United and Graham Taylor was enjoying a honeymoon period as England manager. How times change. </p> <p>If Allardyce could look into a crystal ball, he would probably still be unable to predict what lies in store over the next 10 years at the Reebok Stadium. Still, when Jason Roberts swooped to give West Brom the lead in the dying stages of the first-half, 10-year plans were the last thing on Bolton's mind. </p> <p>Roberts scored his 12th goal of the season after a mistake by Robbie Elliott, who failed to see the pacy striker lurking with intent as he rolled a weak pass back to goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen. Bolton made a concerted effort to claw their way back into the game, but inspired goalkeeping, bad finishing and even bad luck conspired against them. </p> <p>Their promotion ambitions remain intact, but so do Albion's. Perhaps their manager, Gary Megson, deserves a similar contract to Allardyce after reviving the comatose giants of the West Midlands. </p> <p>However, if such a deal can inspire other opponents as it did with Albion, it may be best to keep the news under wraps.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the perils of success is the desire of others to bring you down a peg or two, and Bolton manager Sam Allardyce will know all about that after seeing West Bromwich Albion spoil his New Year celebrations. The talk before the game surrounded Bolton's decision to hand manager Allardyce a new 10-year contract. Allardyce agreed to sign the mammoth deal on New Year's Day, but rarely can a football club have bestowed such extraordinary faith in their manager. Bolton will know that much can happen during a decade in football. Ten years ago, they were fighting a losing battle to escape the old Third Division, but since those dark days, Wanderers have twice scaled the heights of the Premiership, been to Wembley for a League Cup Final and narrowly missed out on an FA Cup Final appearance. Ten years ago, Sir Alex Ferguson was still searching for his first championship at Manchester United and Graham Taylor was enjoying a honeymoon period as England manager. How times change. If Allardyce could look into a crystal ball, he would probably still be unable to predict what lies in store over the next 10 years at the Reebok Stadium. Still, when Jason Roberts swooped to give West Brom the lead in the dying stages of the first-half, 10-year plans were the last thing on Bolton's mind. Roberts scored his 12th goal of the season after a mistake by Robbie Elliott, who failed to see the pacy striker lurking with intent as he rolled a weak pass back to goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen. Bolton made a concerted effort to claw their way back into the game, but inspired goalkeeping, bad finishing and even bad luck conspired against them. Their promotion ambitions remain intact, but so do Albion's. Perhaps their manager, Gary Megson, deserves a similar contract to Allardyce after reviving the comatose giants of the West Midlands. However, if such a deal can inspire other opponents as it did with Albion, it may be best to keep the news under wraps.",

Such phrases as 'relegation-haunted' and 'crisis club' can be brought out of cold storage. In case they did not realise it, Joe Royle's side are in the throes of a fully-fledged relegation fight after a perfunctory surrender to Charlton - a fight which will become considerably tougher should they lose at Coventry tomorrow. As any economist will confirm, boom times can turn to bust with breathtaking alacrity, a fate that has befallen a City team who have known only the former during successive promotion seasons. Nor are the signs for a possible recovery at all promising, based on a City form book of one win in 11, five points from the last available 33, culminating in this defeat to a Charlton side, promoted with City last season, who opened the current campaign with a 4-0 victory over the Mancunians. The manner in which City conceded yesterday's goals was particularly symptomatic of a side in freefall. Poor defending at a corner; an errant goalkeeper's clearance; a penalty and a clearance kicked against a Charlton player and directly into their own goal earned City a torrid reponse from alarmed and disgruntled supporters at the end of each half. Charlton had already signalled their intent, Claus Jensen forcing Nicky Weaver into a two-handed diving save from a tenth-minute free-kick, before forging ahead 16 minutes later. Richard Dunne could only flick Jensen's corner to the edge of the six-yard box, where Steve Howey became entangled with his own feet, allowing Jonatan Johansson to turn and sweep in the opening goal. Nine minutes later Weaver's clearance was intercepted by Radostin Kishishev, who raced forward and rolled the ball across the area for Johansson to bury his second. There should have been another for Charlton before the interval, Mark Fish prodding the ball beyond the halfway line where Johans son collected and sprinted half the length of the field, only to chip the ball feebly into Weaver's arms. City had already responded by bringing on new \u00a32.5m signing Darren Huckerby - the answer to Royle's search for a 'proven goalscorer' - as a replacement for unpopular full-back Laurent Charvet. But Huckerby, who has scored one Premiership goal since September 1999, could not be expected to have any bearing on a contest long settled by the time Charlton scored their third in the 78th minute.

By the time the Maine Road public address called for the club electrician to report to the tunnel, Royle must have hoped he would pull the plug on what was rapidly becoming the worst home performance and result of the season. Sadly for the City manager that was not to be and he was forced to watch the fourth Charlton goal arrive in bizarre circumstances, when Howey's fiercely struck clearance cannoned off Jensen and flew fully 35 yards past Weaver into the City goal.

      "body": "<p>Wembley's famous twin towers stadium could survive as the home of English football - but only if it shrinks to 55,000 seats and stays closed until 2007. </p> <p>A plan to renovate rather than totally rebuild the venue where England won the 1966 World Cup will be discussed on Friday by Wembley's bosses and the Football Association. </p> <p>The scheme, designed to ease the financial crisis sur rounding the stadium's redevelopment, is one of four to be debated. </p> <p>The plan is contained in a confidential briefing paper for Wembley National Stadium Limited and the FA, its parent company. The confidential document, prepared by WNSL managing director Bob Stubbs and which has been seen by The Observer , makes clear that each of the four options risks further problems, including the potential repayment of a \u00a3120 million lottery grant. It warns that a renovated sta dium could have as few as 55,000 seats, would not reopen until autumn 2007 and would not be able to host European football finals. </p> <p>Two of the options involve scaling down the stunning design for the new Wembley unveiled 18 months ago by architects Sir Norman Foster and HOK-Lobb. A planned hotel, office block, visitor attraction and two restaurants and a fast-food outlet would either be built as shells or abandoned altogether, saving \u00a324.5m or \u00a33m respectively. While the first option would let the stadium reopen on schedule in spring 2004, the other would further delay reopening until early 2005. </p> <p>The fourth option involves designing a new, 80,000-capacity stadium, 10,000 fewer seats than Foster's plan. That would save WNSL \u00a3121.5m on the \u00a3660m cost but would see the stadium stay closed until 2006. Like the other three options, it would be a public relations disaster for Wembley. </p> <p>The briefing paper warns WNSL and the FA that three of the four options would involve seeking fresh planning permission from Brent Council - something WNSL's new chairman, Sir Rodney Walker, has ruled out. </p> <p>Faced with such unpalatable options, WNSL may consider whether to abandon Wembley as a location altogether and build a new stadium on a greenfield site.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wembley's famous twin towers stadium could survive as the home of English football - but only if it shrinks to 55,000 seats and stays closed until 2007. A plan to renovate rather than totally rebuild the venue where England won the 1966 World Cup will be discussed on Friday by Wembley's bosses and the Football Association. The scheme, designed to ease the financial crisis sur rounding the stadium's redevelopment, is one of four to be debated. The plan is contained in a confidential briefing paper for Wembley National Stadium Limited and the FA, its parent company. The confidential document, prepared by WNSL managing director Bob Stubbs and which has been seen by The Observer , makes clear that each of the four options risks further problems, including the potential repayment of a \u00a3120 million lottery grant. It warns that a renovated sta dium could have as few as 55,000 seats, would not reopen until autumn 2007 and would not be able to host European football finals. Two of the options involve scaling down the stunning design for the new Wembley unveiled 18 months ago by architects Sir Norman Foster and HOK-Lobb. A planned hotel, office block, visitor attraction and two restaurants and a fast-food outlet would either be built as shells or abandoned altogether, saving \u00a324.5m or \u00a33m respectively. While the first option would let the stadium reopen on schedule in spring 2004, the other would further delay reopening until early 2005. The fourth option involves designing a new, 80,000-capacity stadium, 10,000 fewer seats than Foster's plan. That would save WNSL \u00a3121.5m on the \u00a3660m cost but would see the stadium stay closed until 2006. Like the other three options, it would be a public relations disaster for Wembley. The briefing paper warns WNSL and the FA that three of the four options would involve seeking fresh planning permission from Brent Council - something WNSL's new chairman, Sir Rodney Walker, has ruled out. Faced with such unpalatable options, WNSL may consider whether to abandon Wembley as a location altogether and build a new stadium on a greenfield site.",

      "body": "<p>Kevin Gallen will be back in London tomorrow with Huddersfield Town, playing Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park, the ground he once described as his least favourite. He is slightly embarrassed to be reminded now. 'I was playing in the Premiership when I said that,' explained Gallen, whose side drew 0-0 with Sheffield Wednesday yesterday (see right). 'I used to compare everything to Manchester United. 'I've played on a few worse grounds than Crystal Palace since then.' Gallen's story is a cautionary tale familiar enough in football, the meteoric rise and dazzling promise of teenage years giving way to a decidedly unspectacular mid-career. There are a few twists in the telling - he has never had any recurring problems from the cruciate ligament injury which put him out of the game for almost two years, and he has repaid Huddersfield's faith in him by leading their scoring lists this season - but you could not have told anyone five years ago that the Queens Park Rangers striker who famously scored 153 goals in 110 matches to break Jimmy Greaves's South East Counties youth record would ever end up on a free transfer to the McAlpine Stadium.</p> <p>Lou Macari, the Terriers' manager who knows a thing or two about scoring, believes Gallen faces a long slog to recapture what he had at under-18 and under-21 level, when he used to receive more publicity than his contemporary Robbie Fowler. 'You don't have injuries like he had and emerge unscathed,' Macari said. 'You always lose something. Those injuries were the reason he struggled to find a club in the summer. </p> <p>'I don't think anything has affected his football brain, but sometimes the body won't take you where you want to go. 'He still knows where the goal is, but it will need an awful lot of work on his condition if he wants to be as lethal again.' </p> <p>Gallen smiles and claims Macari would say that about any of his players. 'Hard work is always the answer as far as the gaffer is concerned, whatever the question,' Gallen said. 'I'm not knocking him, though. He's turned this club around since he's been here, and he's given me a decent run in the team.' </p> <p>If pushed, Gallen will accept that he is not as lethal as he once was. 'I've maybe lost a yard of pace. I don't know, it's hard to measure those things,' he said. 'Plus, my overall fitness or sharpness is not the only consideration. You also have to take into account what sort of team I'm playing in, how well they are doing, how many chances are created, all sorts of things. </p> <p>'I had it pretty good when I first broke into the Premier ship. Rangers had a good team at the time and I quickly struck up a rapport with Les Ferdinand, but it all started to slide a bit when they sold Les and didn't buy a replacement. 'I was 19, Danny Dichio was only a year older, and there was a lot of pressure on us.' </p> <p>If relegation was bad, Gallen's cruciate injury two games into the following season was worse, particularly as he had managed a promising three goals in one-and-a-half matches. He had only the one serious injury - 'I hate it when people say I'm injury prone' - but despite playing 40 games for QPR in his first full season back, he made only seven starts last season under Gerry Francis. </p> <p>He knew it was time to sever his connection with the club he had supported as a boy when he was finally offered a new contract. He discovered it to be for one year only, at about half the money he had been put on when Rangers had been fighting off interest from Liverpool and Manchester United. </p> <p>'I made a deliberate decision to get out of London and make a fresh start,' he said. 'I'd been at Rangers too long, and it had become too easy and comfortable. 'I could have just carried on, but no 25-year-old wants to be in the reserves or on the bench. </p> <p>'At that age you've got to be playing, so I decided to go to a club who could give me a regular game. 'Steve Bruce promised that, and to be fair he was as good as his word. 'The present manager has stuck with me as well. The only games I've missed have been through minor injuries, and I'm happy with that. I would have been depressed if I had come up here and been left out of the team.' </p> <p>Gallen should be even happier soon. He is on course to reach double figures in a season for the first time as a professional. Now halfway through a one-year contract he is effectively a free agent from tomorrow, so to an extent he is in the shop window as well. Does he worry he is now viewed as damaged goods? </p> <p>'No, I'm just glad to be playing again, and I feel I've still got a lot of my career ahead of me,' he said. I very much want to get back into the Premiership, and I won't give up on that ambition.' Does he ever wish, then, that his rise had not been quite so rapid so that he could continue his career in relative peace and quiet instead of constantly being asked, in a somewhat less cheery manner than George Best used to be, where it all went wrong? </p> <p>'What's done is done. You can't change it even if you wanted to,' he said. 'I'm still glad I beat Jimmy Greaves's scoring record, if that's what you mean. That was a great achievement, and I'm proud of it. I didn't know what the future held. But who does?' </p> <p>Who indeed? not many guessed that the penalty Gallen missed on his return to Loftus Road this season would spark such a recovery from the Terriers, who still have a lot of work to do but have at least climbed out of the immediate danger zone. In his youth, Gallen once said his ambition was to captain England, yet he has never been as wide-eyed about success as that remark suggests. As the biggest influence on his career he always cites his older brothers, Joe and Steve, whose professional careers were blighted by back injuries. </p> <p>And a prescient realism surfaced in his QPR heyday, at the very same time he used to describe Selhurst Park as his least favourite ground. 'I don't actually know if Manchester United bid \u00a37m for me,' he said in 1995. 'But all the lads at Loftus Road say the club should have sold me. They reckon I won't be worth anything like that sort of money in a couple of years.'</p>",

You see, my team is Weymouth, of the Doc Marten's League Premier Division. Yeovil used to be our rivals, opponents in many a fierce New Year encounter. </p> <p>I hate Morecambe, too. Next Saturday they will be at home to Ipswich Town of the Premiership. The last time they reached the third round was in 1962, when, astonishingly, they drew the only other non-League side to make it through - Weymouth. We won 2-1 at Christie Park in front of 12,000 people. This year, while they delight in their day, fewer than 1,000 will welcome Welling United to Wessex Stadium. </p> <p>You may detect a little envy here. This year's third round looks especially one to relish and one in which the non-League is unusually well-represented, with Chester City, Kingstonian and Dagenham and Redbridge (our opponents in the FA Trophy; after the Lord Mayor's Show of Charlton Athletic come us) also through. </p> <p>To boot, there are some intriguing local rivalries - Leeds United v Barnsley, for example - and meaty all-Premiership ties, such as Newcastle United v Aston Villa - John Gregory's present club away to his future one? Pick of them all, though, is the mouth-watering encounter between Fulham and Manchester United, which will tell us more about just how good are Jean Tigana's side, so silky in the First Division, and their prospects for more demanding weekly meetings next season. </p> <p>Indeed, the FA have got lucky with such an evocative draw. This year marks the start of their new chief executive Adam Crozier's mission to rehabilitate the Cup after last year's nadir when Manchester United were excused (though it means that it is an amazing 19 months since they won a tie) and dates were shifted, with the third round being played before Christmas. </p> <p>Now it is in its rightful place, a diverting tonic after the excess of the holiday period. Optimism is kindled anew - at least until next week when, for many, their season is reassessed. For managers, the sacking season begins in earnest when for many clubs disappointment and the prospect of a relegation struggle at worst, a flat few months at best, kick in. </p> <p>George Graham, for example, has much to fear from a trip with Tottenham Hotspur to Leyton Orient. It may only be a few miles through east London but Spurs travel very badly. With new owners possibly looking at a change of direction and fans unlikely to tolerate quietly four months of mid-table mediocrity, Graham's need for a result is pressing. Glenn Hoddle - possessor of a get-out clause in his Southampton contract - waits for the call from repertory to the West End. </p> <p>The ever-entertaining Gordon Strachan may also have to account for himself if Coventry City fall at Swindon Town, unlikely as the prospect looks. Arsenal also look unlikely to subside at Carlisle, but then didn't they say that when George Graham took his Highbury aristocrats - as champions indeed - to Wrexham eight years ago? For Watford, the respite from league travails of a home tie against Everton could represent a turning point they are desperately seeking.</p> <p>It could be, in fact, that a few Premiership teams at home are more in danger. West Bromwich Albion should fancy their chances at Derby, Birmingham City at Manchester City. Chelsea, though, ought to dispose of Oldham Athletic at Stamford Bridge, but what of Claudio Ranieri if the unthinkable occurs? </p> <p>Outside of Fulham, much interest will focus on the non-League clubs. And having seen two rounds in which the Conference acquitted themselves so well against Nationwide League opposition, the FA will again be looking for evidence to support their proposed shake-up of the game outside the Premiership. </p> <p>In the week before Christmas, the FA, the Conference and the League met to discuss a proposal of three up, three down with the Third Division. The League, aware of the fate of turkeys around the festive period, were not keen to vote in the idea. They especially did not like the plan for 'parachute' payments to relegated clubs to soften the blow. The FA is likely to pursue the matter, however, believing that some Conference clubs are in better order than some in the Third Division. </p> <p>They want the League to come up with inventive ways of solving the parachute problem. For example, there could be play-offs between the team finishing ninetieth in the League and third in the Conference, the profits going to the defeated club. In addition, the Conference are believed to be negotiating a TV deal with a terrestrial channel, which could be attractive to the current lower orders.</p> <p>I also understand that the FA are holding back a trump card: if the League will not agree to three down, then they could get their mates in the Premiership to suggest only one down, and consequently one up from the First Division. The New Year promises intrigue on and off the pitch. </p> <p>There is still some way to go for the Cup to re-establish itself fully after a period of neglect. It remains annoying, for example, that replay dates are dictated by local police forces, despite Crozier's desire to return them to the few days after the initial tie, when interest is at its height. This time, they will take place in the week beginning 15 January. Curious, though, isn't it that Nuneaton v Stoke in the first round was played a few days later when Sky television decided they wanted to cover it? Money still talks. </p> <p>At least less so, in some circumstances. It is encouraging that the Leyton Orient and Morecambe ties have not been switched, with the less wealthy clubs seeing the games as windfalls rather than chances for glory. The FA are getting tougher in their criteria for changing venues. </p> <p>Actually, now I think about it, I don't hate Morecambe. Don't even hate Yeovil. Much. In fact, teeth gritted, I wish the 'green slime' well at Bolton, particularly an old mate in the Yeovil captain Terry Skiverton.

Sweden's favourite Hoover nozzle exporter, supplier of shoes to Observer Sport and all round Elk-eating legend. </p> <p><strong>Loser of the year</strong> </p> <p> Ken Bates, David Mellor and Francis Maude have nothing on BARRY HEARN. Despite recruiting teenage Kosovan refugee Naim Uka to play for Leyton Orient, Hearn made headlines in March by telling Nicky Campbell on BBC 5 Live: 'I think it's disgraceful we let all these people [refugees] into the country. It's about time we started looking after ourselves. I wouldn't have one of them in.' Uka - who arrived in the country in the back of a lorry after his parents disappeared, his home was blown up and his neighbours murdered - seemingly fell into Hearn's 'one of us' category. A few black and black-ish boxers could remain in the country, Hearn said, 'because they could make me a fortune'. </p> <p><strong> Top rediscovery </strong></p> <p> Eight years ago, LARS ELSTRUP - Luton's record signing at \u00a3850,000 - scored the Euro 92 semi-final winner for Denmark against France. A year later he quit the game to join a religious commune ('The Wild Geese') and, in August, we found him in the middle of the busiest pedestrian shopping street in Copenhagen circled by a rope, waving his penis at passersby. 'In some respects,' he told us, 'I do this to provoke people. I like experiencing people's reactions. Some might take my message to be \"sod off\" and others an offer of sex. I am very aware of people's reactions and I love the fact that people recognise me as Lars Elstrup.' He placed a scarf on the pavement for contributions, and made 27 Danish Kroner (\u00a32.25) in one afternoon. He later slapped a heckling schoolboy before wrestling a police officer to the ground and being arrested.Elstrup told police he 'should have hit the boy harder' and filed a complaint against the sect - 'They are inhuman and even stole Devi, my dachshund. I am now ready to go to the European Court of Human Rights.' We've not heard from him since. </p> <p><strong>Top tabloid shocker </strong></p> <p> A big category. At the start of the year, Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards was caught 'romping' with a Brazilian prostitute, Kieron Dyer was exposed in a 'sickening sex rampage' (\u00a9 News of the World); and Hartlepool mascot 'H'Angus, a blue monkey (real name Stuart), was sacked for simulating sex with a female steward. But the winner is Tottenham's STEFFEN IVERSEN, exposed after demanding dog noises from team-mates during bawdy international away trips. 'Some of the players met in a mobile home,' revealed team-mate Erik Mykland in his new book. 'I was ordered to walk around naked and drunk. At every corner he said I had to lift my leg like a dog urinating and say \"Woof, woof\".' Iversen came clean: 'Every word is true. I don't care.' </p> <p><strong>Strangest player</strong></p> <p>EMMANUEL PETIT also revealed this year: 'I want to be a doggy'. Petit's wish, which came just a week after Iversen's revelations, was provoked by death threats aimed at colleague Youri Djorkaeff. 'I started thinking about Youri and I decided \"I'd like to be a dog\",' said Manu. 'Dogs are nice. They can sleep anywhere, they wag their tails and on top of that they get stroked all the time.' It was the greatest profundity of a busy year - previously he'd used his official website to describe his love of leather, and mused 'I wish humans could live on the moon.' He's now been linked with an \u00a38m move home from Barca reserves to Fulham, but still can't work out why he's so widely quoted. 'Why write about me? To do half a page on me - well , I sneeze, frankly. With the war in Chechnya, I think there are better things to do.' </p> <p><strong> Most moving website </strong></p> <p> In January, out-of-work managers queued up to put their CVs online at the League Managers Association website. Highlights among the original 29 candidates included John Hendrie playing the dating game: 'I am a bubbly character with infectious enthusiasm' (the entry has since been toned down) and 'Terence' Fenwick, who looked back on his time at Portsmouth as a 'real success'. Pompey fell into administration just after he left, as did his next club, Crystal Palace. Twelve months on, after a near miss at Middlesbrough, he's still looking. </p> <p><strong>Top stats of the year </strong></p> <p> In January, ARSENAL claimed to be 'officially best team of century' after an Independent newspaper study of results rated them more successful than any other English club side over the past 100 years. The Daily Telegraph's version, though, had Liverpool leading - while we had Everton (P3,758, W1,545, D917 L1,296) the clear winners. We were probably wrong. </p> <p><strong>Scoop of the year </strong></p> <p>20 December, The Mirror: 'KEANE: I WON'T MOVE TO LEEDS' 'Robbie Keane last night pledged his future to Inter Milan and insisted he does not want to return to the Premiership.'</p> <p>Keane joined Leeds approximately 7 hours later. </p> <p>Said &amp; Done 2000 Awards - part two next week </p> <p>david.hills@observer.co.uk</p>",

Despite recruiting teenage Kosovan refugee Naim Uka to play for Leyton Orient, Hearn made headlines in March by telling Nicky Campbell on BBC 5 Live: 'I think it's disgraceful we let all these people [refugees] into the country. It's about time we started looking after ourselves. I wouldn't have one of them in.' Uka - who arrived in the country in the back of a lorry after his parents disappeared, his home was blown up and his neighbours murdered - seemingly fell into Hearn's 'one of us' category. A few black and black-ish boxers could remain in the country, Hearn said, 'because they could make me a fortune'. Top rediscovery Eight years ago, LARS ELSTRUP - Luton's record signing at \u00a3850,000 - scored the Euro 92 semi-final winner for Denmark against France. A year later he quit the game to join a religious commune ('The Wild Geese') and, in August, we found him in the middle of the busiest pedestrian shopping street in Copenhagen circled by a rope, waving his penis at passersby. 'In some respects,' he told us, 'I do this to provoke people. I like experiencing people's reactions. Some might take my message to be \"sod off\" and others an offer of sex. I am very aware of people's reactions and I love the fact that people recognise me as Lars Elstrup.' He placed a scarf on the pavement for contributions, and made 27 Danish Kroner (\u00a32.25) in one afternoon. He later slapped a heckling schoolboy before wrestling a police officer to the ground and being arrested.Elstrup told police he 'should have hit the boy harder' and filed a complaint against the sect - 'They are inhuman and even stole Devi, my dachshund. I am now ready to go to the European Court of Human Rights.' We've not heard from him since. Top tabloid shocker A big category. At the start of the year, Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards was caught 'romping' with a Brazilian prostitute, Kieron Dyer was exposed in a 'sickening sex rampage' (\u00a9 News of the World); and Hartlepool mascot 'H'Angus, a blue monkey (real name Stuart), was sacked for simulating sex with a female steward. But the winner is Tottenham's STEFFEN IVERSEN, exposed after demanding dog noises from team-mates during bawdy international away trips. 'Some of the players met in a mobile home,' revealed team-mate Erik Mykland in his new book. 'I was ordered to walk around naked and drunk. At every corner he said I had to lift my leg like a dog urinating and say \"Woof, woof\".' Iversen came clean: 'Every word is true. I don't care.' Strangest player EMMANUEL PETIT also revealed this year: 'I want to be a doggy'. Petit's wish, which came just a week after Iversen's revelations, was provoked by death threats aimed at colleague Youri Djorkaeff. 'I started thinking about Youri and I decided \"I'd like to be a dog\",' said Manu. 'Dogs are nice. They can sleep anywhere, they wag their tails and on top of that they get stroked all the time.' It was the greatest profundity of a busy year - previously he'd used his official website to describe his love of leather, and mused 'I wish humans could live on the moon.' He's now been linked with an \u00a38m move home from Barca reserves to Fulham, but still can't work out why he's so widely quoted. 'Why write about me? To do half a page on me - well , I sneeze, frankly. With the war in Chechnya, I think there are better things to do.' Most moving website In January, out-of-work managers queued up to put their CVs online at the League Managers Association website. Highlights among the original 29 candidates included John Hendrie playing the dating game: 'I am a bubbly character with infectious enthusiasm' (the entry has since been toned down) and 'Terence' Fenwick, who looked back on his time at Portsmouth as a 'real success'. Pompey fell into administration just after he left, as did his next club, Crystal Palace. Twelve months on, after a near miss at Middlesbrough, he's still looking. Top stats of the year In January, ARSENAL claimed to be 'officially best team of century' after an Independent newspaper study of results rated them more successful than any other English club side over the past 100 years. The Daily Telegraph's version, though, had Liverpool leading - while we had Everton (P3,758, W1,545, D917 L1,296) the clear winners. We were probably wrong. Scoop of the year 20 December, The Mirror: 'KEANE: I WON'T MOVE TO LEEDS' 'Robbie Keane last night pledged his future to Inter Milan and insisted he does not want to return to the Premiership.' Keane joined Leeds approximately 7 hours later. Said &amp; Done 2000 Awards - part two next week david.hills@observer.co.uk",

Farmer expects there to be no clamour for a cut-back in Champions League matches when the main broadcasters of Europe's premier club competition meet in Switzerland in February.

And it wasn't all that long ago that football was holding out against live broadcasts because of the damage they might do to the game. Unsurprisingly, Sky have received enquiries from terrestrial TV about showing highlights of rugby union's big event next summer - the Lions tour of Australia - but have yet to strike a partnership deal. Sky's contract for exclusive live rights to rugby union in the southern hemisphere takes in the Lions' trip and also entitles them to sell on delayed coverage to a terrestrial broadcaster.

Then again, the player they sold to Middlesbrough in the summer scored few goals for City as stunning as the one that earned them a point here. </p> <p>With time and space to clear, Whelan volleyed David Thompson's 41st-minute corner past his own startled goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer from the angle of the six-yard box. </p> <p>A nightmarish way to mark your twenty-sixth birthday, but the own goal represented only one of the reasons for Whelan's obvious distress when he was put out of his misery and substituted midway through th second half. </p> <p>Alen Boksic's 86th-minute equaliser will have eased his despair marginally, but this was still a birthday from hell for Whelan. It might have been so different, though, if he had accepted a 12th-minute chance. </p> <p>The striker did well to squeeze a shot inside the post from a sharp angle after Hamilton Ricard's shot was diverted to him, but Barry Quinn's excellent sliding interception deprived him of a confidence-boosting goal. </p> <p>Whelan's final contribution to a mediocre first-half came in stoppage time when he went down under a challenge from goalkeeper Chris Kirkland. It was a fall that fooled nobody. </p> <p>Referee Dermot Gallagher rightly dismissed Middlesbrough's claims for a penalty, while Coventry's feisty midfielder David Thompson had plenty to say to Whelan in an angry exchange which followed. </p> <p>The second-half was no better for Whelan. He shot against the legs of Kirkland when clear in the 51st minute and lashed an easier chance over the bar in the 66th minute. He was heading down the tunnel with his head bowed seconds later. </p> <p>Boro boss Terry Venables said: 'He was upset because he felt I brought him off because of the miss, I'd already decided to substitute him. </p> <p>'It was just one of those days for him. These things happen. I thought Noel worked very hard, but you can try too hard playing against your old club. He was a bit uptight.' </p> <p>Middlesbrough's best spell followed Whelan's exit and Kirkland made an excellent save from Keith O'Neill before Boksic, a half-time substitute, accepted a pass from Ricard and finished with a quality rarely witnessed yesterday. </p> <p>Coventry manager Gordon Strachan smiled: 'Boksic's terrific. You don't half become a better coach when you bring on a world-class player.' </p> <p>As for Coventry, Craig Bellamy's 63rd-minute shot saved by Schwarzer was their only threat, but at least they are becoming more difficult to beat. Strachan said: 'It wasn't looking great a couple of months ago, but this is another step on the road to recovery.' </p> <p>Venables, yet to experience a defeat since taking over, said: 'Sometimes it doesn't go for you, but we kept at it.'</p>",

With time and space to clear, Whelan volleyed David Thompson's 41st-minute corner past his own startled goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer from the angle of the six-yard box. A nightmarish way to mark your twenty-sixth birthday, but the own goal represented only one of the reasons for Whelan's obvious distress when he was put out of his misery and substituted midway through th second half. Alen Boksic's 86th-minute equaliser will have eased his despair marginally, but this was still a birthday from hell for Whelan. It might have been so different, though, if he had accepted a 12th-minute chance. The striker did well to squeeze a shot inside the post from a sharp angle after Hamilton Ricard's shot was diverted to him, but Barry Quinn's excellent sliding interception deprived him of a confidence-boosting goal. Whelan's final contribution to a mediocre first-half came in stoppage time when he went down under a challenge from goalkeeper Chris Kirkland. It was a fall that fooled nobody. Referee Dermot Gallagher rightly dismissed Middlesbrough's claims for a penalty, while Coventry's feisty midfielder David Thompson had plenty to say to Whelan in an angry exchange which followed. The second-half was no better for Whelan. He shot against the legs of Kirkland when clear in the 51st minute and lashed an easier chance over the bar in the 66th minute. He was heading down the tunnel with his head bowed seconds later. Boro boss Terry Venables said: 'He was upset because he felt I brought him off because of the miss, I'd already decided to substitute him. 'It was just one of those days for him. These things happen. I thought Noel worked very hard, but you can try too hard playing against your old club. He was a bit uptight.' Middlesbrough's best spell followed Whelan's exit and Kirkland made an excellent save from Keith O'Neill before Boksic, a half-time substitute, accepted a pass from Ricard and finished with a quality rarely witnessed yesterday. Coventry manager Gordon Strachan smiled: 'Boksic's terrific. You don't half become a better coach when you bring on a world-class player.' As for Coventry, Craig Bellamy's 63rd-minute shot saved by Schwarzer was their only threat, but at least they are becoming more difficult to beat. Strachan said: 'It wasn't looking great a couple of months ago, but this is another step on the road to recovery.' Venables, yet to experience a defeat since taking over, said: 'Sometimes it doesn't go for you, but we kept at it.'",

A couple of months ago they fell out. Morrison, 21, a vibrant talent with ability and attitude to burn, wasn't realising his potential, so Smith taught him a lesson by slapping him on the transfer list. One kick up the backside and a flurry of goals later, Smith is choosing Christmas presents for the boy, taking him out for meals, and putting a great deal of time into nurturing a player he expects to be outstanding once he is fully matured. </p> <p>Recently Ray Houghton, one of Smith's coaches, admitted they spend more time talking about Morrison than anything else. </p> <p>Not for nothing is Crystal Palace's prodigious striker teased by his team-mates about being the gaffer's son.

      "bodyText": "Midway through gushing about Clinton Morrison in the most paternal and affectionate way a manager could ever talk about a player, Alan Smith checked himself and quipped that if he carried on like this, their relationship would sound like a romance. The bond is certainly an intense one. A couple of months ago they fell out. Morrison, 21, a vibrant talent with ability and attitude to burn, wasn't realising his potential, so Smith taught him a lesson by slapping him on the transfer list. One kick up the backside and a flurry of goals later, Smith is choosing Christmas presents for the boy, taking him out for meals, and putting a great deal of time into nurturing a player he expects to be outstanding once he is fully matured. Recently Ray Houghton, one of Smith's coaches, admitted they spend more time talking about Morrison than anything else. Not for nothing is Crystal Palace's prodigious striker teased by his team-mates about being the gaffer's son. It's as if Smith has two quests at Selhurst Park: managing the football team and developing Morrison. 'We have a really good relationship which is a bit more than just manager and player and I have to be careful with the other players that I don't let that go too far,' he adds. He can't hold back too much, though, because he reckons Morrison is a rough diamond well worth polishing but in need of plenty of elbow grease. 'He needs constant management and attention.

As Vieira dwelt on the ball some 25 yards out, Rae snapped into the tackle and the loose ball ran for McCann.

      "body": "<p>The feeling that Blackburn are the team best equipped to present a genuine First Division title challenge to Fulham have been reinforced. </p> <p>While second-placed Bolton slumped to a home defeat by West Bromwich Albion, Blackburn beat Crewe 1-0 - their fourth successive win, and one which showed that, like all successful teams, they can get their hands on maximum points when not at their best. </p> <p>Matt Jansen, who came off the bench to score both of Blackburn's goals in a Boxing Day triumph over Birmingham, got in the scoring act again with a left-foot from just inside the penalty area. </p> <p>The biggest surprise was at the top of the Second Division, where Millwall lost 3-2 at home to Notts County. </p> <p>They had twice come from behind to make it 2-2, but continued to make life difficult for themselves through having Christophe Kinet sent off, and were eventually sunk by a Gary Owers goal in the last minute. </p> <p>Dave Bassett, one of Atkins's managerial heroes, has confirmed he has applied for the vacant manager's job at Wolves. 'I think other applicants are being considered over the weekend and I hope to hear something early in the new year,' he said. </p> <p>If he does get it, one man who might be quite envious of him is Ian Atkins. To Atkins - one of Bassett's greatest admirers - being manager of Carlisle has been tantamount to 'banging my head against a wall'.

      "bodyText": "The feeling that Blackburn are the team best equipped to present a genuine First Division title challenge to Fulham have been reinforced. While second-placed Bolton slumped to a home defeat by West Bromwich Albion, Blackburn beat Crewe 1-0 - their fourth successive win, and one which showed that, like all successful teams, they can get their hands on maximum points when not at their best. Matt Jansen, who came off the bench to score both of Blackburn's goals in a Boxing Day triumph over Birmingham, got in the scoring act again with a left-foot from just inside the penalty area. The biggest surprise was at the top of the Second Division, where Millwall lost 3-2 at home to Notts County. They had twice come from behind to make it 2-2, but continued to make life difficult for themselves through having Christophe Kinet sent off, and were eventually sunk by a Gary Owers goal in the last minute. Dave Bassett, one of Atkins's managerial heroes, has confirmed he has applied for the vacant manager's job at Wolves. 'I think other applicants are being considered over the weekend and I hope to hear something early in the new year,' he said. If he does get it, one man who might be quite envious of him is Ian Atkins. To Atkins - one of Bassett's greatest admirers - being manager of Carlisle has been tantamount to 'banging my head against a wall'. He adds: 'But for my enthusiasm for football - for working with players - I would have chucked this job in two or three months ago.' Still, despite Carlisle's position at the bottom of the league, there are compensations. One concerns the extent to which Atkins has galvanised some of his players - notably their 22-year-old striker, Scott Dobie, who is producing his best form for some time and again attracting the attention of bigger clubs. The other will be provided by next weekend's FA Cup third-round tie at home to Arsenal. If any lower-division manager could do with a match like this to bring some glamour into his life, and emphasise his true worth, it is Atkins. Noted for his transformation of Northampton, whom he steered from the Third Division to the brink of the First, Atkins has not had much scope to rise to the fore again since his controversial sacking there last year. His move to Carlisle in the summer was preceded by four months at Chester, where he ultimately failed to prevent them going out of the league by just one point. He suggests that in some ways, the challenge of saving Carlisle is even more stressful. Referring to the behind-the-scenes turmoil over Michael Knighton's sale of the club, he says: 'I did not fully appreciate the problems for me.

But the latter will certainly have to do better than they did yesterday, when they could only manage a goalless draw against lowly Oldham.

Sorry you were there in times of trouble (know what that's like from experience).</p> <p>Some advice on <strong>Singapore</strong> and <strong>Malaysia</strong>. Internal flights in Malaysia are much cheaper when bought within the country, rather than from outside. What you can do when you arrive in Singapore is make a booking with Malaysian Airlines for flying to or from Sarawak, then you can take a Malaysian Airlines bus from Singapore to Johor Bahru (which only costs $10) as the flights to Sarawak go from there. If you ask at the Malaysian airlines desk at Changi (Singapore airport) they should be able to tell you about this.</p> <p>Sarawak is great, especially <strong>Kuching</strong>. I stayed first in an awful hotel called the Arif in the Islamic area (do NOT stay there) then moved to the Goodwood Inn on Jalan Green Hill near the city centre which was much better and still not too expensive. There are plenty of places to stay, whatever your price range. Lots to see too - the city itself is great, especially Shop Street along the esplanade, where there are some great artifact shops scattered amongst the kitsch ones. Pepper biscuits are yummy; pepper is THE crop of Sarawak and they make everything from it - biscuits, perfume, tea, etc. A stroll along the esplanade in the evening is great because they play music and the fountains by the fort light up and dance. You can hire one of the boats on the river to yourself for an hour which takes you up and down the river and isn't too expensive. There is a cat museum which is actually quite interesting, although on the 'wrong' side of the river. The Islamic museum behind the new museum is very good. The new and old museums aren't bad. There is the cultural show which is in a village displaying each tribe's house style. Definitely worth a visit; you can book from any of the major hotels and the coaches go from the hotels and back. Also, you should book a couple of days at the Bako National Park (booked through tourist bureau near the museums) which is the best place in Sarawak for viewing or hearing wildlife (watch out for the monkeys which steal anything not nailed down). Sarawak is very humid and quite hot and it rains very heavily most afternoons. Eat early in the evening as most eating places seem to close down at 6pm!</p> <p> If you want to go to other towns you can get a boat from Kuching to <strong>Sibu</strong> (once a day) which takes four hours and is good fun. I liked Sibu; it is a frontier town (like Manaus in Amazonas) with a terrific market, a nice chinese pagoda giving good views, and from there buses run north up the coast to Miri which is the jumping off spot for Gunung Mulu national park and also the Niah caves at Batu Niah. Batu Niah has the best hostel accommodation in Malaysian Borneo and the caves are awesome.</p> <p> Gunung Mulu I felt was a rip off - you could only fly in, you have to stay two nights to see all four caves because of the flight times, the hostel is OK but is no longer self-catering (no kitchen) and there are only two places to eat (the one outside the camp over the river is run by the surliest people I ever met!) If you're there on a Sunday look for the Iban market under the trees by the river. The caves are quite good, although you need a good torch and the bats leaving the cave at night are worth seeing, but on the whole it's an expensive trip. </p> <p>Anyway, that might help you make up your mind. I had a week in Kuching itself which was just enough. Sarawak only really has the one road up the coast, and buses are like coaches and run to timetables.</p> <p>Have a great time and happy new year.</p>",

If you ask at the Malaysian airlines desk at Changi (Singapore airport) they should be able to tell you about this. Sarawak is great, especially Kuching. I stayed first in an awful hotel called the Arif in the Islamic area (do NOT stay there) then moved to the Goodwood Inn on Jalan Green Hill near the city centre which was much better and still not too expensive. There are plenty of places to stay, whatever your price range. Lots to see too - the city itself is great, especially Shop Street along the esplanade, where there are some great artifact shops scattered amongst the kitsch ones. Pepper biscuits are yummy; pepper is THE crop of Sarawak and they make everything from it - biscuits, perfume, tea, etc. A stroll along the esplanade in the evening is great because they play music and the fountains by the fort light up and dance. You can hire one of the boats on the river to yourself for an hour which takes you up and down the river and isn't too expensive. There is a cat museum which is actually quite interesting, although on the 'wrong' side of the river. The Islamic museum behind the new museum is very good. The new and old museums aren't bad. There is the cultural show which is in a village displaying each tribe's house style. Definitely worth a visit; you can book from any of the major hotels and the coaches go from the hotels and back. Also, you should book a couple of days at the Bako National Park (booked through tourist bureau near the museums) which is the best place in Sarawak for viewing or hearing wildlife (watch out for the monkeys which steal anything not nailed down). Sarawak is very humid and quite hot and it rains very heavily most afternoons. Eat early in the evening as most eating places seem to close down at 6pm! If you want to go to other towns you can get a boat from Kuching to Sibu (once a day) which takes four hours and is good fun. I liked Sibu; it is a frontier town (like Manaus in Amazonas) with a terrific market, a nice chinese pagoda giving good views, and from there buses run north up the coast to Miri which is the jumping off spot for Gunung Mulu national park and also the Niah caves at Batu Niah. Batu Niah has the best hostel accommodation in Malaysian Borneo and the caves are awesome. Gunung Mulu I felt was a rip off - you could only fly in, you have to stay two nights to see all four caves because of the flight times, the hostel is OK but is no longer self-catering (no kitchen) and there are only two places to eat (the one outside the camp over the river is run by the surliest people I ever met!) If you're there on a Sunday look for the Iban market under the trees by the river. The caves are quite good, although you need a good torch and the bats leaving the cave at night are worth seeing, but on the whole it's an expensive trip. Anyway, that might help you make up your mind. I had a week in Kuching itself which was just enough. Sarawak only really has the one road up the coast, and buses are like coaches and run to timetables. Have a great time and happy new year.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Debbie Lawson </strong> </p> <p> Morocco, 1993</p> <p> It was our second visit to Morocco and this time we were ready for it - a small rucksack, a few words of Arabic and an attitude of practised nonchalance. We were heading south to the Algerian border, where the first shallow dunes of the Sahara spread out. It was so hot my T-shirt stuck to my back. The book had mentioned a quirky-sounding hotel, the Auberge de Repos du Sable, a former kasbah run by artists. We took a taxi to the desert and there it was, complete with sign to 'Timbuktu - 52 jours'. Beside it was the burnt-out shell of a Fifties Citro\u00ebn van, relic of the hippie trail, and beyond, in the dunes, an old car seat and a family of camels. Our room was made of mud and straw, with a window that looked out on to an island of palm trees. We lay in the shaded courtyard as the sun went down, drinking mint tea sweetened by sugar lumps the size of coal. There was no chance of a shower - the bathroom floor was teeming with scorpions - and as we settled down to sleep I became aware of a scrabbling sound coming from the gap under the door. By the light of the moon we watched them march in: flying ants, crickets, darkling beetles, giant cockroaches, strange slug-like creatures I'd never seen before. There was nothing for it but to retreat to the roof, where a stiff breeze kept the beasties at bay and overhead shooting stars filled the sky with cascades of bright light. We didn't sleep a wink. It was a night I'll never forget. </p> <p> <strong> Jacqui MacDermott</strong> </p> <p> France, 1980</p> <p> 'We must have some money left,' said Karena. I checked again. 'Not a centime.' We were on a campsite just outside Perpignan on the French/Spanish border with nothing but a small tent, a couple of coach and ferry tickets and half a bottle of Pastis (the last evidence of our rampant overspending). And we were hungry. You think we might have gone home. You think we might have rung and persuaded long-suffering parents to wire some cash. But we were 18 (just), stupid and proud. 'There's nothing for it,' said Karena, 'we'll have to beg for food. We'll walk around the campsite and ask everyone we see.' It seemed a good enough solution, so we set off separately to accost fellow campers. It's a sobering experience, begging. Young people generally just tell you to piss off, and parents gather their children nervously about them as if you might steal one. An hour later we met back at the tent. I had half a jar of jam, Karena produced an almost full packet of Quaker Porridge Oats. So that was that. For the last few days of our trip we lived like Goldilocks off watery porridge with jam - and we could hardly bear it. Mind you, being 18 and off the leash, we always managed to persuade someone to buy us beer in the evenings... </p> <p> <strong> Natalie Sutton</strong></p> <p> Mexico, 1990</p> <p> What relief we felt when we stumbled into a hotel room in Puerto Angel, Mexico. Our shoulders ached after a slow journey down from Acapulco on a bus shared with chickens and goats. My friend Sonia grunted, keeled over and fell asleep. I sat on my bed enjoying the sporadic breeze offered by the cranky fan. Then I spotted a big black scorpion poised to strike about three inches from my big toe. I catapulted on to Sonia's bed. Still mumbling, Sonia ran to get help. The manager and his family of 14 came to the rescue, cackling helplessly with laughter at the stupid 'gringos'. The scorpion was tracked down and dealt with brutally by the manager's children. They had the last laugh by telling us that scorpions always travelled in pairs. 'Good night, senoritas,' grinned the manager, chewing on his toothpick. Fat chance. </p> <p> <strong> Jay Rayner</strong></p> <p> Italy, the 1980s</p> <p> With a pack on your back, wherever you drop is your bed. For me it was the train or, to be more exact, the floor of the train. I chose trains as my bed because, with a European rail pass already paid for, it was the cheapest place I could find to spend the night. It had to be the corridor floor because everyone else with a rucksack was doing the same thing and all the seats had gone. I did at least have an advantage over most people: I was awfully large. My size was crucial. If you were slim of hip, sure, you too could stretch out in the corridor but you could guarantee that you would be kicked awake repeatedly by people getting past you in the narrow space between your body and the wall. With me there was never any narrow space. I filled it. What's more, being large, people seemed to be scared of me. (I suspect the Mohican haircut may have had something to do with it.) And so they would do anything to pass without touching me. I remember waking one night between Florence and Brindisi and seeing a young guy clinging to the walls above my head, trying to traverse the carriage three feet above the floor. I smiled up at him. He smiled uneasily down at me. And then he went on his way. I, in turn, rolled over and gently drifted back to sleep. </p> <p> <strong> Oliver Owen</strong> </p> <p> The Balkans, 1983</p> <p> Backpacking means economising, and for the smoker this is always difficult. Back in 1983 my favoured fag was a John Player Blue - now, sadly, no longer available - but in Israel, on a kibbutznik's meagre wage, the smoke of choice was a Sheraton. They were rough, but three months on the kibbutz and the Sheratons and I were getting along fine. How I missed them when I left. In Egypt the affordable smoking option was the Cleopatra and its equally ghastly sister-smoke the Nefertiti. But on my travels the worst of a bad bunch was the Greek gasper - Hellas Gold. So keen was I to avoid these Athenian firesticks that I extravagantly bought a pack of 10 Marlboro to see me through a 27-hour train ride to Belgrade. As I slept, my friend Giles smoked my cigarettes. I was horrified and very hurt. The trust was gone. The remaining month of the trip was a strain. </p> <p> <strong> Dave Hills</strong> </p> <p> Italy, the 1990s</p> <p> As a teenager who had rarely travelled beyond Surrey, I didn't realise that wearing a shiny new backpack was an open invitation to Europe's rip-off merchants. But so it proved . We were soon lured into an original deathtrap hotel in Rome - bread rolls and salami for breakfast and dinner, one toilet per 50 guests and - even we knew this was not right - bare wires in the shower. In an expensive travellers' hostel we slept three to a bed in 90-degree temperatures with stinking sheets and the owner used a laser pen to chase rats from the corridors as well as trace the contours of my girlfriend's body through the shower curtain. We spent four nights in a Prague concrete block being charged \u00a320 for a two-mile taxi ride into town, every day, without complaining once (Englishness strikes the young hard); and one evening was spent eating what seemed to be raw lamb in Malta, an unforgettable meal, tasting of playground nosebleeds. We went as teenagers and came back as bitter teenagers, but with a bigger world view none the less. </p> <p> <strong> Jason Burke </strong> </p> <p> India, 1993</p> <p> This was my moment. I glared down from the balcony of my Delhi guesthouse at the banana-pancake munching hordes stopping over in the Indian capital on their way to Goa or across to Thailand. Not for me the fleshpots and tropics. My destination was lean and rugged - the Himalayas and a solo attempt on a 21,000ft mountain. I would, I decided, climb above the mess, and mass, of humanity. I rang my mum first. Barely able to shoulder my pack, full of French post-war novels, I staggered on to the train north. Three days later I had hiked up to the snowline. The next night I spent in a shepherd's cabin burning pages of De Beauvoir to keep warm. I was miserable and lonely. After drinking melted snow for a couple of days my guts were in a state of disrepair. Accepting my destiny, I admitted defeat and headed back to the villages below. I never read Sartre with quite the same pleasure again. </p> <p> <strong> Joanna Walters</strong> </p> <p> France, 1981</p> <p> My mate Suzette and I were 17 when we set out on the autoroute with thumbs up and big smiles. We clambered up into the cab of the lorry as dusk fell. We let the driver put our rucksacks in the back and soon fell asleep. I woke to find the driver tugging at my clothes. He'd pulled into a deserted layby in the pitch dark. Suzette woke to the sound of my firm 'Non!' We said we'd walk but he reminded us our rucksacks were locked in his trailer. Then he tutted and said something in French I didn't understand. Suzette wailed - he'd said if one of us did not have sex with him in five minutes he would kill us. Just then a car pulled up in front. I ran to it sobbing for the man inside to help me. He accompanied me back to the lorry where the driver had given in and was lifting down our rucksacks. We've both backpacked and hitchhiked thousands of miles since then and got into many scrapes. But I've never again let anyone lock my rucksack in the back or fallen asleep on the road. </p> <p> <strong> Liz Myers</strong> </p> <p> The French Alps, 1980</p> <p> Dammit, that's the zip gone, I thought. Slipping on the ice outside my lodging, I had sat down on my bum with enough force to break the zip on my, admittedly skintight, jeans. I had been working in a French ski equipment/hire shop; on days off I was free to ski. After work, I'd hit the apr\u00e8s ski. It was as I was heading for my favourite bar one February night that I fell. By the next day my lower back was agony. The manageress at work called a doctor. Things moved fast. My right leg swelled alarmingly, and I was soon on my way down the mountainside in an ambulance. Hospital tests showed acute compression of several vertebrae plus a clot in the main vein alongside. I found myself immobilised in a hospital bed, with a drip to dissolve the clot. There I remained for a month. It was March by the time they let me out, on a solemn promise not to work for another month. By that time the skiing, and seasonal jobs, would be finished, but I consoled myself with the thought that when friends back home asked about the 'ski bum' experience, I could say I had found a whole new meaning for the term. </p> <p> <strong> Jonathan Cook</strong> </p> <p> Turkey, 1991 </p> <p> I was standing in the middle of a dark road, my rucksack locked in the boot of a taxi, having a blazing row with the driver which - if the bedroom lights being switched on provided a clue - was waking most of the street. I'd arrived late at Dalaman airport and, caught by the usual late-night taxi cartel, started canvassing other travellers to share a ride. That upset the cabbies, of course, one of whom agreed to my knock-down price in an attempt, I suppose, to stop me putting ideas into the heads of other customers. By the time we arrived at my destination, Fethiye, he'd had second thoughts and doubled the price. That's why we were arguing in the street. As the driver rapidly lost his command of English and started shouting in Turkish, a young male passerby turned translator. Soon bleary-eyed people were appearing from doorways, some in their nightwear. They listened attentively to both our arguments. Then after a few minutes the translator, sensing a consensus, delivered their verdict. Without a word the driver opened the boot, handed over my pack, accepted the agreed fare and drove off into the night. </p> <p> <strong> Harriet Lane</strong> </p> <p> The Philippines, 1990</p> <p> You haven't had the full backpacking experience unless your travelling companion has fallen in love and left you playing gooseberry in one of the most beautiful places in the world. Ten years ago, my best friend, Miss X, and I found ourselves on the paradisical Filipino island of Boracay, sharing beers with a moustachioed American of advanced years (well, at least 35) who rolled enormous spliffs and managed to hint, without actually saying anything specific, that he was a senior member of the CIA. Before long, I was spending long hours of solitude in my hammock and even after we left the island it led to some terrific rows.</p>",

Similarly, Liverpool is familiar to me only through Brookside , although I'm told I have been there en route to Ireland when I was about six.

Many of my friends, particularly those I've met travelling, have been to more parts of the globe than I have, and, indeed, know less of their homelands. As round-the-world air tickets routinely cost less than \u00a31,000, and allow you to travel for up to a year, it becomes easy to save up to go away, and the availability of working visas in the Antipodes allows for a convenient rebuilding of funds halfway round. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the shift away from the job-for-life culture has made 'going away travelling' something everyone wants to do; a perfectly legitimate option to contemplate after a relationship break-up, or when you're fed up with your job.

      "bodyText": "This year, I went from Russia to China on the Trans-Siberian railway. I spent six weeks in Senegal, Mali and Gambia. I saw the sun rise on the new millennium at the top of the Langtang valley in Nepal. I've been to Tibet, Pakistan, Laos and Morocco. I have not, on the other hand, visited Nottingham. Similarly, Liverpool is familiar to me only through Brookside , although I'm told I have been there en route to Ireland when I was about six. I went to Manchester at the age of 14 on a geography field trip, and although several of my friends went to university there I never got around to visiting. I don't think this is unusual. Many of my friends, particularly those I've met travelling, have been to more parts of the globe than I have, and, indeed, know less of their homelands. As round-the-world air tickets routinely cost less than \u00a31,000, and allow you to travel for up to a year, it becomes easy to save up to go away, and the availability of working visas in the Antipodes allows for a convenient rebuilding of funds halfway round. Meanwhile, the shift away from the job-for-life culture has made 'going away travelling' something everyone wants to do; a perfectly legitimate option to contemplate after a relationship break-up, or when you're fed up with your job.

Ex-members of the Peniel Pentecostal Church and others believe Pickles has 'an appalling conflict of interest' because Brentwood and Ongar Conservatives have received thousands of pounds from church members.</p> <p>Reid - a former policeman turned insurance salesman turned evangelist - and his companies have donated at least pounds 2,500 to Pickles's fighting fund and the Conservative Party, while his church members have boosted Tory funds by around pounds 5,000.</p> <p>Pickles has defended members of the church 'as wonderfully normal people'. Others disagree.</p> <p>Former church member Caroline Green was a constituent of Pickles at the time she left the sect. She is one of those who will be writing to the Westminster standards ombudsman. She told The Observer: 'The bishop is a deeply troubled man who says terrible things about people who have opposed him. He has been excommunicated from another church, runs companies controlling millions of pounds and is very intimidating. How can you ask your MP to help you, if he supports the bishop?'</p> <p>Reid refers to himself and other evangelists as the 'anointed of God'. He was excommunicated for 'raillery' - a biblical term for slander - from Liverpool's Devonshire Road Christian Fellowship in 1969 and his 'flesh was committed to Satan'.</p> <p>The billboard next to Sainsbury's car park in Brentwood proclaims 'Miracles, Healing, Faith: Come and See' and shows Reid holding a small boy with one hand and a microphone in the other. The miracle mentioned in the billboard is not detailed.</p> <p>Miracles cited by the church have included the sensational recovery of a boy from leukaemia. The church explains the case of Sam Mildenberger as follows: 'The miracle was that he was cured of a rare form of leukaemia when he was 18 months old having been given an hour to live, Bishop Reid having been asked by his parents - who are not and never have been members of the Peniel church - to pray for him at Great Ormond Street Hospital. He died some eight years later from complications following a viral infection.'</p> <p>The church did not highlight the fact of a bone-marrow transplant in the boy's recovery.</p> <p>Mildenberger's death certificate shows he died from haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis - the rare form of leukaemia he had allegedly been miraculously cured of. Dr Peter May, a GP and member of the General Synod of the Church of England, said: 'Viral illness is not mentioned in the death certificate. Cause of death is attributed to the rare form of leukaemia he was suffering. It led directly to his death. I have not found any evidence to support the claims of instantaneous cure of incurable diseases.'</p> <p>A spokesman for Great Ormond Street said they did not want to comment on any aspect of the alleged miracle.</p> <p>Reid now fronts a multi-million pound videos-to-insurance empire that includes one company, McCartney and Dowie Investment Management plc, which controls funds of pounds 41 million but paid only pounds 1,715 in tax in 1999. Reid's spokesman says the company is liable for tax only on its taxable profits.</p> <p>Members of his church are invited to tithe 10 per cent of their gross income and to take out insurance policies through the bishop's companies.</p> <p>Now the Bible school of which Reid is president is to be sued for assaulting children. Reid has been an enthusiastic supporter of corporal punishment or 'paddling' in the past. He has said: 'Children are little demons. They have foolishness in their hearts. You have a stick and they have a rear end. I believe in smacking them - a sharp smack on the rear end. But make sure it's a real shock.'</p> <p>The court proceedings, due to be issued in the new year, will turn on allegations of assault on two children, then aged seven and nine, who claim they suffered beatings by Peniel members. Their mother told The Observer yesterday: 'I am bringing this case not just for my children, but also for the other youngsters still inside this disturbing religious sect.'</p> <p>Reid, the church and the school deny any wrong-doing. The church says the bishop has never spanked a child personally, nor does he encourage churchgoers to use corporal punishment.</p> <p>At first glance, services at the Peniel headquarters, in Pilgrim's Hatch, Brentwood, are impressive. Hundreds of well-dressed, polite church-goers make their devotions. The choir sways and sings in smiling harmony. But the main event is the sermon by Reid. At the service The Observer went to the bishop was sweetness and light. But extracts from other sermons recorded on tape tell a different story. Reid has denounced Buddhists and Hindus as 'foul heathens', declaring 'non-Christians are ignorant. They are on their way to hell'.</p> <p>Reid was enthroned by the late Archbishop Benson Idahosa of Benin City, Nigeria. Reid tells a story which illustrates Idahosa's allegedly supernatural powers. A Benin witchdoctor is supposed to have made it rain on one of Idahosa's ceremonies. Idahosa promised that the troublemaker would die. According to Reid, recorded on tape, 'The archbishop said by nine o'clock he'll be dead: \"I'll kill him\". At a quarter past eight he dropped dead.'</p> <p>The church describes these allegations as bizarre and denies that Reid made such comments.</p> <p>Pickles took part in a photocall with Reid, Idahosa and a third controversial evangelist, Bishop Earl Pearly Paulk of Atlanta, Georgia, some years ago.</p> <p>Idahosa once claimed he raised eight people from the dead. The Advertising Standards Authority asked to see death certificates to prove they had been dead before Idahosa stepped in. No death certificates were provided, and the claim was dropped.</p> <p>He first surfaced in the public eye in 1986 when a US embassy official found two US tennis players, Bud Cox and Skip Strode, in a hotel room in Lagos. 'I could hear chanting through the open door,' the US official said. 'Both were stripped naked. Everywhere were tiny pieces of paper, pieces of US currency, pieces of traveller's cheques, pieces of a Bible. They were born-again Christians and Rev Idahosa was the catalyst,' said the official. The babbling, naked tennis players were given clothes and tickets back to the US.</p> <p>Idahosa drove a pink Cadillac. Reid drives a blue Mercedes.</p> <p>There are many people who have fallen foul of Reid who disagree with Pickles's view of the 'wonderfully normal' Peniel church and its bishop. One doubter is the Rev Norman Meeton, pastor of the Devonshire Road Christian Fellowship in Liverpool at the time Reid was excommunicated on 3 November, 1969. He told The Observer : 'He was excommunicated for raillery', for slandering people. It was horrendous and destructive. He lived with us for a time. He would swing from one mood to another, at one moment contrite, the next a roaring lion.'</p> <p>A second doubter is the Rev Ian Wilson, best man at Reid's wedding in October 1971. Wilson, a Christian evangelist now living in Canada, told The Observer : 'He's the original spinmeister, a master salesman. He can be charming and then switch and be a frightening adversary who suppresses opposition with the most violent language. He caricatures people, vilifying them and impugning their character. I think Reid is a little Mussolini.'</p> <p>Mother-of-three Caroline Green, who fled the church three years ago, is a third sceptic. She said: 'It is hard to think of a less \"wonderfully normal\" person. Michael Reid has a toweringly strong personality, which he uses to dominate church members. Families end up being torn apart. My children have lost their father because he is still in the church and under the thumb of the bishop. My ex-husband started calling me The Enemy. It was like talking to a robot. That was an appalling thing for my children to endure.'</p> <p>Green continued: 'We paid a tenth of our gross income to the church, plus all kinds of extras. We took out 13 insurance policies with companies the bishop or his associates control, taking the commission. We paid out at least pounds 400 a month to the church, plus pounds 402-a-month fees for the Peniel school. The cost was crippling, but the real damage was psychological.'</p> <p>She is making a claim to recover more than pounds 100,000 which she says was paid out under undue influence. Among others, she is writing to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards about the alleged conflict of interest of Pickles.</p> <p>A fourth doubter is Green's sister, Susan Hilton, who said: 'I felt helpless to do anything to rescue her as she was entrenched within the sect. He would unsettle the congregation with the idea that if they ever went against his word there would be trouble. It was like an emotionally abusive marriage.'</p> <p>Three more critics of Reid are Max and Joan Carter and their son Tim. Life-long Christian Max Carter said: 'Michael Reid is a powerful manipulator. We left the church in 1988, as we were concerned about the way things were going. Reid had hinted there was a young man with homosexual tendencies in the congregation. Then word went round that it was our son, Tim, then 17. This was a horrible false rumour which Michael did nothing to combat. When we left, my family was vilified. I was identified as an evil man.'</p> <p>Tim Carter said simply: 'Bishop Reid is a bully.'</p> <p>When the Carters left the church they were shunned by their old friends. Max Carter's sister remains in the church and no longer speaks to him. Joan Carter said: 'It was awful to be shunned and ignored by Christian people you had known for so many years.'</p> <p>Max Carter said: 'It seems as though down the years I somehow threatened Michael Reid. My son was called a homosexual. The accusations were totally false. He could have squashed these evil rumours, but nothing was done. Since we left the church, I have been called a pervert. Again, totally false, again totally unfair.'</p> <p>An eighth critic of Reid is Helen Hagerty, who is incapacitated by ME. She travelled to the Peniel church four years ago, having answered a 'healing' ad in the ME newsletter. She said: 'Soon Reid was mocking and ridiculing a broad spectrum of Christian denominations and practices, and I became increasingly aware that I was watching and listening to the most un-Christlike man I have ever met.'</p> <p>A ninth is another ex-member of the church, who declined to be named: 'When someone falls out with the bishop, families end up falling apart. My sister is not talking to my father because he was critical of Bishop Reid. He has a heart condition and is greatly upset.'</p> <p>A tenth met the bishop recently: 'Time and again the bishop turned the conversation to homosexuals and paedophiles. He has an astonishing capacity for hate.'</p> <p>Reid and the Peniel church insist they are just successful Christians who have attracted jealousy from a 'handful of individuals'. On the subject of Reid's companies, his spokesman said he has remained a director of companies with which he was con cerned prior to his consecration as a bishop. He merely continues in his role as a non-executive director to supervise the proper running of the companies concerned.</p> <p>On his alleged excommunication, the church says there was a disagreement about doctrinal interpretation, but subsequently relationships were restored and Reid re-attended meetings. The church says Reid does not 'have the habit of denouncing people who oppose him'.</p> <p>Caroline Green told The Observer : 'What has happened is a catastrophic failure by people to see Bishop Reid for what he really is. In this sort of case you want to get in touch with the local MP. But he supports the bishop and the church. So what do you do?'</p> <p>The Brentwood and Ongar Conservatives have received thousands of pounds from the bishop, his associates and members of the sect. In 1998, 119 Peniel members joined one branch of the local Tory association over two days, boosting Tory funds by around \u00a35,000.</p> <p>Reid donated \u00a3500 to Pickles's 1997 election fighting fund, and \u00a31,000 to the Tories when he attended a Quota Club dinner in 1997 at the Carlton Club with then Chancellor Kenneth Clarke. The bishop's spokesman said it is a matter of public record that McCartney and Dowie Investment Management donated \u00a31,000 to the Conservative Party in 1999.</p> <p>Reid and his companies have, then, donated at least \u00a32,500 to Pickles and the Conservatives in the three years up to 1999. Pickles told The Observer : 'I have personally received no financial donations from Bishop Reid or his associates. The fighting fund is for the party locally and not for my exclusive use. This is the normal practice among associations.'</p> <p>Tony Donnelly - president of the breakaway Independent Conservative Association, set up in the wake of the Peniel members joining the Pilgrim's Hatch branch of the party - said: 'Eric Pickles is helped by the support of the Peniel and the bishop. It's difficult to express what's going on. Ordinary people in Brentwood and Ongar are frightened of Peniel.'</p> <p>Chairman of the Brentwood and Ongar Conservative Association, Michael Parrish, was critical of Bell and the independent Conservatives, saying they were guilty of 'religious bigotry and Nazism, something which won't show up well on his [Bell's] CV.'</p> <p>Bell said yesterday: 'I am not, nor have I ever been, a member of the Nazi party.'</p> <p>Donnelly said: 'A lot of people are writing off Bell as dead in the water, but the late Archbishop Idahosa isn't the only one who can bring back people from the dead.'</p>",

Reid, the church and the school deny any wrong-doing. The church says the bishop has never spanked a child personally, nor does he encourage churchgoers to use corporal punishment. At first glance, services at the Peniel headquarters, in Pilgrim's Hatch, Brentwood, are impressive. Hundreds of well-dressed, polite church-goers make their devotions. The choir sways and sings in smiling harmony. But the main event is the sermon by Reid. At the service The Observer went to the bishop was sweetness and light. But extracts from other sermons recorded on tape tell a different story. Reid has denounced Buddhists and Hindus as 'foul heathens', declaring 'non-Christians are ignorant. They are on their way to hell'. Reid was enthroned by the late Archbishop Benson Idahosa of Benin City, Nigeria. Reid tells a story which illustrates Idahosa's allegedly supernatural powers. A Benin witchdoctor is supposed to have made it rain on one of Idahosa's ceremonies. Idahosa promised that the troublemaker would die. According to Reid, recorded on tape, 'The archbishop said by nine o'clock he'll be dead: \"I'll kill him\". At a quarter past eight he dropped dead.' The church describes these allegations as bizarre and denies that Reid made such comments. Pickles took part in a photocall with Reid, Idahosa and a third controversial evangelist, Bishop Earl Pearly Paulk of Atlanta, Georgia, some years ago. Idahosa once claimed he raised eight people from the dead. The Advertising Standards Authority asked to see death certificates to prove they had been dead before Idahosa stepped in. No death certificates were provided, and the claim was dropped. He first surfaced in the public eye in 1986 when a US embassy official found two US tennis players, Bud Cox and Skip Strode, in a hotel room in Lagos. 'I could hear chanting through the open door,' the US official said. 'Both were stripped naked. Everywhere were tiny pieces of paper, pieces of US currency, pieces of traveller's cheques, pieces of a Bible. They were born-again Christians and Rev Idahosa was the catalyst,' said the official. The babbling, naked tennis players were given clothes and tickets back to the US. Idahosa drove a pink Cadillac. Reid drives a blue Mercedes. There are many people who have fallen foul of Reid who disagree with Pickles's view of the 'wonderfully normal' Peniel church and its bishop. One doubter is the Rev Norman Meeton, pastor of the Devonshire Road Christian Fellowship in Liverpool at the time Reid was excommunicated on 3 November, 1969. He told The Observer : 'He was excommunicated for raillery', for slandering people. It was horrendous and destructive. He lived with us for a time. He would swing from one mood to another, at one moment contrite, the next a roaring lion.' A second doubter is the Rev Ian Wilson, best man at Reid's wedding in October 1971. Wilson, a Christian evangelist now living in Canada, told The Observer : 'He's the original spinmeister, a master salesman. He can be charming and then switch and be a frightening adversary who suppresses opposition with the most violent language. He caricatures people, vilifying them and impugning their character. I think Reid is a little Mussolini.' Mother-of-three Caroline Green, who fled the church three years ago, is a third sceptic. She said: 'It is hard to think of a less \"wonderfully normal\" person. Michael Reid has a toweringly strong personality, which he uses to dominate church members. Families end up being torn apart. My children have lost their father because he is still in the church and under the thumb of the bishop. My ex-husband started calling me The Enemy. It was like talking to a robot. That was an appalling thing for my children to endure.' Green continued: 'We paid a tenth of our gross income to the church, plus all kinds of extras. We took out 13 insurance policies with companies the bishop or his associates control, taking the commission. We paid out at least pounds 400 a month to the church, plus pounds 402-a-month fees for the Peniel school. The cost was crippling, but the real damage was psychological.' She is making a claim to recover more than pounds 100,000 which she says was paid out under undue influence. Among others, she is writing to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards about the alleged conflict of interest of Pickles. A fourth doubter is Green's sister, Susan Hilton, who said: 'I felt helpless to do anything to rescue her as she was entrenched within the sect. He would unsettle the congregation with the idea that if they ever went against his word there would be trouble. It was like an emotionally abusive marriage.' Three more critics of Reid are Max and Joan Carter and their son Tim. Life-long Christian Max Carter said: 'Michael Reid is a powerful manipulator. We left the church in 1988, as we were concerned about the way things were going. Reid had hinted there was a young man with homosexual tendencies in the congregation. Then word went round that it was our son, Tim, then 17. This was a horrible false rumour which Michael did nothing to combat. When we left, my family was vilified. I was identified as an evil man.' Tim Carter said simply: 'Bishop Reid is a bully.' When the Carters left the church they were shunned by their old friends. Max Carter's sister remains in the church and no longer speaks to him. Joan Carter said: 'It was awful to be shunned and ignored by Christian people you had known for so many years.' Max Carter said: 'It seems as though down the years I somehow threatened Michael Reid. My son was called a homosexual. The accusations were totally false. He could have squashed these evil rumours, but nothing was done. Since we left the church, I have been called a pervert. Again, totally false, again totally unfair.' An eighth critic of Reid is Helen Hagerty, who is incapacitated by ME. She travelled to the Peniel church four years ago, having answered a 'healing' ad in the ME newsletter. She said: 'Soon Reid was mocking and ridiculing a broad spectrum of Christian denominations and practices, and I became increasingly aware that I was watching and listening to the most un-Christlike man I have ever met.' A ninth is another ex-member of the church, who declined to be named: 'When someone falls out with the bishop, families end up falling apart. My sister is not talking to my father because he was critical of Bishop Reid. He has a heart condition and is greatly upset.' A tenth met the bishop recently: 'Time and again the bishop turned the conversation to homosexuals and paedophiles. He has an astonishing capacity for hate.' Reid and the Peniel church insist they are just successful Christians who have attracted jealousy from a 'handful of individuals'. On the subject of Reid's companies, his spokesman said he has remained a director of companies with which he was con cerned prior to his consecration as a bishop. He merely continues in his role as a non-executive director to supervise the proper running of the companies concerned. On his alleged excommunication, the church says there was a disagreement about doctrinal interpretation, but subsequently relationships were restored and Reid re-attended meetings. The church says Reid does not 'have the habit of denouncing people who oppose him'. Caroline Green told The Observer : 'What has happened is a catastrophic failure by people to see Bishop Reid for what he really is. In this sort of case you want to get in touch with the local MP. But he supports the bishop and the church. So what do you do?' The Brentwood and Ongar Conservatives have received thousands of pounds from the bishop, his associates and members of the sect. In 1998, 119 Peniel members joined one branch of the local Tory association over two days, boosting Tory funds by around \u00a35,000. Reid donated \u00a3500 to Pickles's 1997 election fighting fund, and \u00a31,000 to the Tories when he attended a Quota Club dinner in 1997 at the Carlton Club with then Chancellor Kenneth Clarke. The bishop's spokesman said it is a matter of public record that McCartney and Dowie Investment Management donated \u00a31,000 to the Conservative Party in 1999. Reid and his companies have, then, donated at least \u00a32,500 to Pickles and the Conservatives in the three years up to 1999. Pickles told The Observer : 'I have personally received no financial donations from Bishop Reid or his associates. The fighting fund is for the party locally and not for my exclusive use. This is the normal practice among associations.' Tony Donnelly - president of the breakaway Independent Conservative Association, set up in the wake of the Peniel members joining the Pilgrim's Hatch branch of the party - said: 'Eric Pickles is helped by the support of the Peniel and the bishop. It's difficult to express what's going on. Ordinary people in Brentwood and Ongar are frightened of Peniel.' Chairman of the Brentwood and Ongar Conservative Association, Michael Parrish, was critical of Bell and the independent Conservatives, saying they were guilty of 'religious bigotry and Nazism, something which won't show up well on his [Bell's] CV.' Bell said yesterday: 'I am not, nor have I ever been, a member of the Nazi party.' Donnelly said: 'A lot of people are writing off Bell as dead in the water, but the late Archbishop Idahosa isn't the only one who can bring back people from the dead.'",

      "body": "<p>Tomorrow is Cumali Sinangili's 42nd birthday. The Turkish refugee will spend it in a critical condition in a south London hospital. He left a friend's house in Bermondsey, south east London, at around 11 o'clock on Christmas Eve and was expected by another friend later in the evening. Before he could arrive, he was set upon in the street by three white men who had lurched out of a local pub looking for some action.</p> <p>They threw him to the ground, kicked and punched him in the head and stabbed him in the face. The attack on Sinangili, who is applying for asylum in this country, was described by local police as 'gut-wrenching' in its ferocity. It is the third time Sinangili has been attacked in Britain in as many years.</p> <p>Sinangili is just another asylum statistic, another racist attack in a country which for a year has seen politicians bat back and forth one of the most emotive and complex issues to face the nation - asylum seekers. Are they really fleeing persecution? And what of the criminal gangs and unscrupulous business people who prey on the vulnerable and scared who are looking for a better life abroad?</p> <p>An investigation by The Observer reveals a system in chaos. The dispersal programme, that much-vaunted political fix to try and move thousands of asylum seekers from Kent and London to less visible locations around the country, is failing. The costs of dealing with asylum seekers is soaring. The numbers of asylum seekers entering Britain will hit record numbers when the final figures for 2000 are published in a fortnight's time.</p> <p>The heavily criticised process which pays asylum seekers benefits in vouchers rather than cash will be condemned in a report from influential lobby groups including Oxfam and the Refugee Council. The controls put in place to try and stop the flow of people into the country are simply failing.</p> <p>The attack on Sinangili took place during a week when asylum was suddenly back in the headlines. On Wednesday, nearly 30 of his compatriots were found stuffed into the back of a Ford Transit van en route to Dover from Calais. Earlier in the week a pregnant mother, Sheena Tuckfield, was caught, also in Calais, with two Pakistani asylum seekers in the boot of her Ford Orion.</p> <p>Since ferry company P&amp;O Stena started a crackdown on illegal immigrants on 6 December their security guards have discovered 485 people crammed into cars, vans and lorries making the Calais to Dover crossing. P&amp;O Stena believe that they may have saved up to \u00a31 million in fines that they would have had to pay if the asylum seekers had been discovered on the British side.</p> <p>Ann Widdecombe attempted to wade into the choppy waters, saying on Wednesday that if the Tories win the next election they would lock up all asylum seekers in detention centres. It seemed to be in line with an announcement made by the shadow home secretary earlier in the year on the need for secure detention centres.</p> <p>But as with all political pronouncements on asylum, the message leaned more to confusion than understanding. What Widdecombe failed to say was that the Tories had backed away from the detention-for-all policy when it was pointed out that building the 50 secure centres needed would cost \u00a32 billion. Tory critics gleefully say that it is yet another Conservative U-turn.</p> <p>But the Government cannot gloat. Its central dispersal system is causing the most headaches at the Home Office as officials see a policy melt before their eyes. The targets for the number of people to be moved out of the south-east of England are now constantly being revised downwards.</p> <p>When the new system was introduced in April, it was designed to ease the burden of refugee seekers on London and the South-east by setting up a compulsory system to spread new arrivals in 'clusters' around the country. At the same time, all asylum seekers were given vouchers to pay for food and essentials to remove them from the benefit system. The National Asylum Support Service was given the job of dealing with new arrivals, who would receive no support unless they agreed to entering the scheme.</p> <p>The original Home Office dispersal target of 65,000 asylum seekers has already been revised downwards twice as officials at NASS have discovered that many people prefer to go without help rather than leave their communities in London. The latest Home Office figures show that just over 9,000 people have entered the system and it is unlikely that the new target of 36,000 will be met by the end of the financial year.</p> <p>And there is a further problem. Of the 9,000 people who have joined the dispersal programme the Home Office has little idea how many have already returned to London or disappeared from the system altogether. The private companies employed by the Home Office to manage the dispersal scheme have been accused of dumping refugees in slum conditions and several deals with regional local authorities have fallen through.</p> <p>Amanda Sebastyen of the Asylum Education and Legal Fund said: 'We have one example of a brother being dispersed to Leeds and his sister to Nelson in Lancashire. What sort of cluster is that? The system is completely arbitrary.'</p> <p>Richard Kemp, Liberal Democrat leader of Liverpool Council, has been a consistent critic of the dispersal scheme, which he claims has been a disaster from the beginning. So far Merseyside has taken over 2,000 asylum seekers, well short of its target of 6,000, but, according to Kemp, the local authority and social services are often not informed of their arrival.

Damilola and his mother entered Britain on six-month visas in August, while his father was granted exceptional leave to stay in the aftermath of his son's death in November. Nigerian citizens wanting to enter Britain must obtain a visa, which will be granted only if they have enough funds not to have to claim state benefits.

However, although it is unwilling to comment on specific cases, the Home Office has indicated that it would probably be sympathetic to the Taylor family's request. 'There are grand compassionate grounds in this case and those would be taken into consideration,' said a spokesman. The family was moved to emergency accommodation in Mitcham, south London, after Damilola's death, although Dorcas Fayemi, the sister-in-law of Damilola's mother, was moved from the north Peckham flat in which she, Mrs Taylor and her three children had lived for four months, only last week. 'It was a relief to leave the place where there were so many memories,' she said yesterday. 'But I still think of Damilola every minute.' Damilola bled to death in a filthy alley in November after being stabbed in the femoral artery as he walked from Peckham Library to his home in nearby Blake's Road. Twelve youths and one woman have been arrested - and released on bail - in connection with the stabbing. Police sources said last week that senior officers know who was responsible for the killing, but lack sufficient information to make the arrests. Richard Taylor, a civil servant in Lagos, and Gloria Taylor, an accountant, sold their two cars and saved for two years to raise \u00a35,000 to send Gloria and the children to Britain for Gbemisola's treatment at King's College Hospital in Camberwell, south London.

      "bodyText": "Consumers can expect to snap up bargains galore in the January sales as retailers, snowed under by a glut of unsold stock after a disappointing Christmas, slash prices in a desperate move to get cash tills ringing. A chill wind blowing through high streets was this weekend reinforced by a warning from Sir Eddie George, the Governor of the Bank of England, that the good times may be ending. Flat sales figures have also hit the much-vaunted e-commerce sector, which has endured a 'gloomy' time according to insiders. Early indications from major UK stores show that cash tills have only just improved their takings on last year. Hardest hit is the clothing sector, dominated by beleaguered Marks &amp; Spencer, BhS and Next, where competition is fiercest. 'I think Christmas was a bit disappointing. Yet again, retailers are left with lots of stock to shift in the sales.

City analysts fear that if John Lewis has posted flat results, the outlook for others, most notably Marks &amp; Spencer, is not promising.

The allegations have put Britain's Ministry of Defence under new pressure to re-examine links between the use of depleted uranium ammunition and health problems suffered by servicemen who fought in both the Gulf War and in the Balkans. The revelation yesterday that Italy's military prosecutor is examining five fatalities among 20 cases which the Italian media is linking to a so-called 'Balkans syndrome' - similar to Gulf War Syndrome - follows concern in both Belgium and Portugal last week. Depleted uranium has been a source of controversy for over a decade amid claims that its contamination of battlefields in Iraq has caused widespread cancer among Iraqi civilians and contributed to health problems among allied military veterans of the Gulf War. Belgian Defence Minister Andr\u00e9 Flahaut called on Friday for EU Defence Ministers to examine the issue. This followed reports that Portugal's Ministry of Defence had ordered medical tests for its soldiers serving in Kosovo to check for radiation. US attack jets are thought to have fired more than 31,000 rounds of depleted uranium ammunition - used to pierce armour - at Serbian tanks and armoured cars. Last night a spokesman for the MoD in London said: 'It is toxic in much the same way that lead is toxic, and it has a very low level or radiation. In its solid form it poses no great risk.

Will this be the one when I succeed in grasping only what is worthwhile about food and cooking, and discard, with the thwack of a meat cleaver hitting a chopping board, that which is not? </p> <p>I long to be the perfect cook; to shop knowledgeably and to prepare my food with total understanding; to respect the materials I work with and to comprehend fully the techniques I use; to make my own stock, my own chips, my own bread, every time. </p> <p>Will this be the year I buy only that which has been produced organically and with deference for the environment? Is 2001 set to be the date I finally bottle my own fruit and grind my beans for every cup? Perhaps, just perhaps, I could now bear to sieve my sauces twice, and through muslin. </p> <p>Is this to be the year I learn to choose faultlessly in restaurants, always put away the dishes before I go to bed and never let the greengrocer get away with sneaking a duff one into the bag? Will I be able to get through the entire year without forgetting something in the oven, cribbing an idea or opening a wine bottle in lieu of a meal? Is this, the second year of the new millennium, the one in which I will never, again let anything go slushy in the salad drawer of the fridge? </p> <p>But I am not a perfect cook. Yes, I can enthuse wholeheartedly about the buzz ingredients for 2001 - which, for the record, will be seaweed, verjuice, maple syrup, sea salt (it is turning up in both butter and chocolate), rare breeds of poultry and their exquisite blue-grey eggs, sushi, dim sum and teas from way off the beaten track. But should I be a good boy and agree with those who say that restaurant cooking has never been better? Well, no. It is now almost impossible to find simple food, cooked with care and restraint. All I see now are menus that are a hotchpotch of ingredients, cultures and styles. A bit of French, a bit of Thai, a bit of Italian. (Will somebody please, please put that mess known as Pacific Rim cooking out of its misery?) It seems to me that anything goes nowadays just as long as the chef can pile it high in a deep, wide-rimmed dish and crown it with a froth of hamster straw, aka deep-fried leeks. Hype and artifice are what much restaurant cooking is now all about. </p> <p>In the year that follows, I promise to never resort to frozen chips, to bunk off from the compulsory five-a-day fruit and veg rule and to bang on mercilessly about how good food used to be 20 years ago. I will always eat a square meal, never get drunk and never go food shopping when I am hungry. </p> <p>But I am not sure I can. I know very well that for all the life-enhancing, vitamin-packed liquid that spurts daily from my juicer, nothing quite beats the sweet shock of an ice-cold Coca Cola when I want one. That the best curry is the one you scoff from its tin-foil takeaway container while watching the football on the telly. And you know that, hiding underneath those organic, artisan-crafted ingredients in my shopping bag, there lurks a Terry's chocolate orange. </p> <p>This cook hasn't a clue whether the strainer he uses is actually a sieve or a chinois. I only know that it gets the lumps out of my sauce. Neither do I know whether it is correct to use a saut\u00e9 pan to fry my bacon, or if it is acceptable to boil rather than steam rice for a Chinese meal. Neither, frankly, do I care. The only thing I know is when something feels right, when it rings my bell, and when it works for me. Cooking and eating are intensely personal things. Misplaced pedantry and culinary bigotry have no place in my kitchen. </p> <p>My favourite cooking has always been sound, everyday sort of stuff, understated, do-able and as comfortable and 'feelgood as a favourite old sweater. I dislike fussy, fiddly cooking. That doesn't mean that little things don't matter. It is an attention to detail that often makes the difference between something being good and being utterly sublime. What really matters is that we concentrate on those few details that do matter and relax totally about that which makes little difference. </p> <p>It is, I think, necessary to be specific and meticulous about the details of a classic recipe, for instance. While I believe a recipe can often be a straitjacket for the cook, I do think it matters that recipes for traditional dishes are not watered down by slapdash methods and short cuts. To do so is to lose the history, the authenticity and therefore the point of the dish. How many times have I eaten cr\u00e8me brl\u00e9e or bread and butter pudding whose soul has been lost because of the sloth or maniacal meddling of a creative cook? It is good to let a recipe relax and breathe, but don't, please, present it to me as a classic when it plainly is not. </p> <p>The buzz words this year are provenance, integrity and authenticity. Who, may I ask, is now going to eat a piece of beef whose origin and source they do not know? (This could be a bad year for those polystyrene trays of bargain mince.) I for one will be demanding the how, why and wherefore of everything I put in my mouth. Well, almost. </p> <p>Could this be the year I become the cook I aspire to be; the year in which I get overexcited about food rather than gently enthusiastic; when I produce creative and jaw-droppingly original recipes; the one in which I agonise fashionably over which way to fold my new Donna Karan caramel-coloured napkins? Or could this be the year I replace David Beckham at Manchester United?</p> <p><strong> Noodles with oyster sauce </strong></p> <p>You will, I assume, have worked out what you are going to eat for this New Year's Eve. I offer this simple but tantalising noodle dish for New Year's Day, which, if nothing else, will clear your head in the morning. If you cannot face chillies on New Year's Day (and well you might not), then leave them out. The result will simply soothe rather than invigorate.

Once the oil is hot, you will need to work quickly if this is to be truly good. </p> <p>Put on a big pot of water for the noodles and bring it to the boil. Add salt and drop in the noodles, cooking them for the length of time it says on the packet - each type will differ slightly - tasting them from time to time to check for tenderness. </p> <p>Meanwhile, get a wok hot over your highest flame. When it starts to smoke, pour in the oil and shake the pan around so that the oil gets hot quickly. Now add the chopped garlic and the shredded ginger - it will brown in seconds - then add the chilli and the greens. Keep the food moving around the pan and the heat up high (I use chopsticks to move it round). </p> <p>Add the drained noodles then add the liquid seasonings. Toss and stir, and when the greens are wilted and bright in colour and all is sizzling hot, serve.</p> <p><strong> Zaafraani chawal</strong></p> <p>I am not suggesting that anyone should overdo things tonight, but I must admit I include the calming and gently restorative recipe that follows from Madhur Jaffrey's new Step-by-Step Cookery (\u00a319.99, Ebury) because it is soothing and gentle and just might be what you want to eat tomorrow. It is really a side dish, but I have eaten it by the large white bowlful when I need it. Although this recipe calls for basmati, any long-grain, fine-quality rice can be used instead.

Put in the cardamom and cinnamon sticks and stir over the heat a few times. Add the rice and fry, stirring, for one minute. </p> <p>Add 550ml water and tsp salt. Bring to the boil, cover with a tight-fitting lid, reduce the heat to very low and cook for 20 minutes. </p> <p>Gently but quickly fork through the rice to separate the grains.

      "byline": "Jay Rayner",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There is something so very this century about the location of Ubon, the second Japanese fusion restaurant in London from Nobu Matsuhisa. It sits above a swanky health club at Canary Wharf in the Docklands, as if there were something simpatico about the assaults on fitness being performed in the ground-floor gym and the light, delicate, often raw food served in the restaurant four floors above. The decor - simple lines, acres of stripped wood, lots of plate glass affording views of the Thames - adds to that aura of purity. It's all rubbish, though. There's more than enough booze on the wine list, oil in the deep-fat fryer and sugar in the puddings to allow the committed hedonist to treat their body less like a temple and more like a bordello. </p> <p>But here at the epitome of the modern restaurant, a place which has its eye set firmly on the globalised future rather than the past, image is all, as it should be in a location as fake and invented as the great film set which is Canary Wharf. Attention to image and detail should not, however, be mistaken for authenticity. As you enter Ubon the entire floor calls out with a traditional Japanese welcome; in Tokyo you only hear it when entering a department store, not a restaurant. It added to the theatre because, as each person entered and the cry went up, you could not help but turn and look to see who this important soul could be. And in would walk another anonymous Paul Smith suit, another Gucci tie, another two-piece by Nicole Farhi. </p> <p>But that, as I say, is all about image, the common currency of the modern restaurant trade. What really counts here is that the food which underpins the image is, for the most part, terrific. I went with my brother Adam who, as well as killing pheasants with his bare hands, is also a Nipponophile. He rated the sashimi - raw fish, unburdened by vinegared rice - as good as the best he had ever tried in Tokyo. What the food can not be called is easy on the wallet. We ran up a bill of \u00a395 and all we drank was mineral water. Take in that figure. Digest it. That's what this kind of stuff costs and, more to the point, that's what this kind of restaurant can get away with charging. Trade was brisk the lunchtime we went. </p> <p>Let's get the one duff dish out of the way first. Ubon - being a branch of the Nobu empire - specialises in reinventing Japanese food. From the special appetisers we chose a tartare of yellowtail tuna with caviar at \u00a314. It came as a small (read tiny) tian in a pool of miso sauce which overwhelmed the silver-grey grains of caviar and left us wishing that the tuna had remained a lump of sashimi. We were reassured by a plateful of unmucked-with sashimi (as against their slightly seared 'New Style' version); it was beautiful stuff, particularly the beige jewels of fragrant, almost gamey sea-urchin roe. </p> <p>For our main course we ordered rock-shrimp tempura dressed with a sharp lemony cream sauce. The batter was extraordinarily light and the dressing - which would never turn up on a traditional Japanese menu - was a beautiful accompaniment that cut through the richness of the fish. From that climax, the meal went only upwards to the black cod with miso, a signature dish of Nobu Matsuhisa which is truly a thing of beauty: a cut of fish from the tail marinated in miso for three days then seared to give the outside a sweet stickiness while maintaining the rich softness of the flaky flesh. It was chopsticks at dawn as every ounce of sibling rivalry, nurtured at our mother's knee, came roaring out in the fight for the last flake. If any dish can be said to be worth \u00a322.50, this one was and is. </p> <p>We finished with some delicate white-chocolate spring rolls and, as an ideal palate cleanser, a plate of exotic fruit specimens neither of us had ever seen before - combinations of lychee, passion fruit and mango. Was it worth \u00a395? Who knows, but we had a bloody nice time. </p> <p>As we're on the question of money, a quick warning with which to start the new year. A few weeks ago four of us went to a restaurant in west London called Veronica's. The meal was so desperately mediocre I could not even summon the will to review it. We split the bill and handed over two cards. The restaurant charged both halves to my card, which fact I only discovered when I checked my statement a month later. Veronica's, apparently content that it has received payment, has proved remarkably unwilling to check its records to see exactly what happened that night, despite the fact that they took an unauthorised second payment. The lesson here, I suppose, is always check your bank or credit-card statements. I know I will.</p> <p>\u0095 Ubon by Nobu, 34 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 (020 7719 7800). Lunch for two, including wine and service, around \u00a3125. Contact Jay Rayner on <a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is something so very this century about the location of Ubon, the second Japanese fusion restaurant in London from Nobu Matsuhisa. It sits above a swanky health club at Canary Wharf in the Docklands, as if there were something simpatico about the assaults on fitness being performed in the ground-floor gym and the light, delicate, often raw food served in the restaurant four floors above. The decor - simple lines, acres of stripped wood, lots of plate glass affording views of the Thames - adds to that aura of purity. It's all rubbish, though. There's more than enough booze on the wine list, oil in the deep-fat fryer and sugar in the puddings to allow the committed hedonist to treat their body less like a temple and more like a bordello. But here at the epitome of the modern restaurant, a place which has its eye set firmly on the globalised future rather than the past, image is all, as it should be in a location as fake and invented as the great film set which is Canary Wharf. Attention to image and detail should not, however, be mistaken for authenticity. As you enter Ubon the entire floor calls out with a traditional Japanese welcome; in Tokyo you only hear it when entering a department store, not a restaurant. It added to the theatre because, as each person entered and the cry went up, you could not help but turn and look to see who this important soul could be. And in would walk another anonymous Paul Smith suit, another Gucci tie, another two-piece by Nicole Farhi. But that, as I say, is all about image, the common currency of the modern restaurant trade. What really counts here is that the food which underpins the image is, for the most part, terrific. I went with my brother Adam who, as well as killing pheasants with his bare hands, is also a Nipponophile. He rated the sashimi - raw fish, unburdened by vinegared rice - as good as the best he had ever tried in Tokyo. What the food can not be called is easy on the wallet. We ran up a bill of \u00a395 and all we drank was mineral water. Take in that figure. Digest it. That's what this kind of stuff costs and, more to the point, that's what this kind of restaurant can get away with charging. Trade was brisk the lunchtime we went. Let's get the one duff dish out of the way first. Ubon - being a branch of the Nobu empire - specialises in reinventing Japanese food. From the special appetisers we chose a tartare of yellowtail tuna with caviar at \u00a314. It came as a small (read tiny) tian in a pool of miso sauce which overwhelmed the silver-grey grains of caviar and left us wishing that the tuna had remained a lump of sashimi. We were reassured by a plateful of unmucked-with sashimi (as against their slightly seared 'New Style' version); it was beautiful stuff, particularly the beige jewels of fragrant, almost gamey sea-urchin roe. For our main course we ordered rock-shrimp tempura dressed with a sharp lemony cream sauce. The batter was extraordinarily light and the dressing - which would never turn up on a traditional Japanese menu - was a beautiful accompaniment that cut through the richness of the fish. From that climax, the meal went only upwards to the black cod with miso, a signature dish of Nobu Matsuhisa which is truly a thing of beauty: a cut of fish from the tail marinated in miso for three days then seared to give the outside a sweet stickiness while maintaining the rich softness of the flaky flesh. It was chopsticks at dawn as every ounce of sibling rivalry, nurtured at our mother's knee, came roaring out in the fight for the last flake. If any dish can be said to be worth \u00a322.50, this one was and is. We finished with some delicate white-chocolate spring rolls and, as an ideal palate cleanser, a plate of exotic fruit specimens neither of us had ever seen before - combinations of lychee, passion fruit and mango. Was it worth \u00a395? Who knows, but we had a bloody nice time. As we're on the question of money, a quick warning with which to start the new year. A few weeks ago four of us went to a restaurant in west London called Veronica's. The meal was so desperately mediocre I could not even summon the will to review it. We split the bill and handed over two cards. The restaurant charged both halves to my card, which fact I only discovered when I checked my statement a month later. Veronica's, apparently content that it has received payment, has proved remarkably unwilling to check its records to see exactly what happened that night, despite the fact that they took an unauthorised second payment. The lesson here, I suppose, is always check your bank or credit-card statements. I know I will. \u0095 Ubon by Nobu, 34 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 (020 7719 7800). Lunch for two, including wine and service, around \u00a3125. Contact Jay Rayner on jay.rayner@observer.co.uk.",

It has never felt anything more or less than just tomorrow to me, certainly no more significant than September merging silently into October, and for gardeners or anyone that works the land, much less of a measured starting or ending point of the calendar than October or March. But it is as good a time as any to take stock. </p> <p>My own gardening life at the moment is dominated by water. Water across the fields as far as the eye can see, water in the garden, water stopping the septic tank working for a week now, water grinding the traffic to a halt, water flooding the railway tunnels and water falling incessantly from the sky. All the evidence is that it will continue this way. What we gardeners desperately need is a long cold spell followed by a reasonably dry summer followed by a cold dry winter. I imagine that, for purely selfish reasons, there are few non-gardeners who would reject that climatic recipe. But the odds are that we are not going to get it. </p> <p>And we all know that it is not going to happen. There is no scaremongering to be done, global warming has happened and cannot be reversed. The mongering needed now is in methods of adapting and dealing with it rather than anything else. Politicians are showing themselves to be embarrassingly bad at doing this. It is too big, has too many big ideas and crosses too many boundaries - national, cultural and scientific - for them to cope with. They are the wrong people for the job. I tend to go along with the notion that politicians of all hues are a waste of space, but in this instant it is not their fault that they are not up to the task in hand. Global warming cannot be dealt with by edict or posturing and it certainly cannot be 'dealt' with by a Canute-like edict. It is the weather for Christ's sake! All of us as individuals have to accept it and react intelligently to it. </p> <p>So, in the year ahead, what will global warming mean for us? Over the next few weeks, I will be looking at some specific groupings of plants for wet and milder weather, but while we are in stock-taking mode, let's stick with the bigger picture for the moment. Gardeners are certainly right there in the front line when it comes to providing solutions to these climatic effects. I saw in the paper a week or two ago that new buildings in Tokyo will now have to include roof gardens as a means of lowering temperatures. Certainly cities such as London, which is comparatively rich in parks and gardens, will become increasingly attractive places to live. </p> <p>There is a growing realisation that farming methods can directly affect climatic changes. The idea of using biological 'sinks' to soak up greenhouse gases is not a new one - and the Americans have recently used it in a shockingly irresponsible way to avoid cutting their own greenhouse gases - but it has thrown up two really relevant issues for gardeners. The first is unarguable, namely that garden vegetation, especially trees and shrubs, are a vital part of the control of global warming. Anyone with a garden should be planting trees and shrubs in 2001. Resist the temptation to remove any perennial leafy plant without replacing it with two others. As any regular reader of this column will know, I am in love with hedges and now I can bask in the sure and certain knowledge that they are not only aesthetically glorious but morally right. Almost every garden can be improved with more hedges. Hedge yourself in. Surround, bisect and quarter your plot with deciduous hedges and make the weather better for me and everyone else. </p> <p>All of us who garden know that gardens are important. We know that, for us, for our sanity, they are vital. We know that, thanks to the imbecility of the British approach to agriculture since the Second World War, gardens are among the most important wildlife habitats in the western world and now we know that they are an essential ingredient in the physical world that we know. Nothing affects us so much as weather and it is beginning to look as if the weather is interactive. We must learn to influence it as much as it inevitably influences us. The good news is that gardeners can make changes. </p> <p>The second point is more contentious. Research at Ohio State University has shown that soil can soak up a lot of carbon. Soil contains three times as much carbon as all the earth's forests. As a 'soak' it is enormously effective. But over the past 100 years, it is estimated that around 100bn tons of carbon has been lost from the soil into the atmosphere through farming. Most of this has come through ploughing. The enormous extra power that has come through machinery in the past 50 years has meant that much more land is ploughed. Ploughing introduces oxygen into the soil and helps rot organic matter. For ploughing, read digging. In gardening terms, so far so very good. But, as organic matter decomposes, it releases carbon dioxide into the air. </p> <p>The argument is that the process can be reversed. If farmers cut back on their ploughing, added plenty of organic manure and planted more trees, the soil could soak up much more carbon than is currently being lost. This information has made me think hard. It contradicts my empirical view of agriculture that ploughing is a good thing as opposed to direct drilling and more relevantly, contradicts my oft-vaunted view that digging is superior to no-dig gardening. </p> <p>I think I may be wrong. If the Ohio thesis is correct then gardens are potentially a significant contributor to carbon loss. Every time you stick your spade in the ground and turn it over you are adding a fraction to the flood in my garden. Every time that I, all spade and vigour, dig my already well-dug garden, I inch the waters nearer your back door. No-dig gardening still requires the soil to be initially deeply prepared, but untouched thereafter. The wetter winters and dryer summers will need masses of organic material added to the soil to provide drainage and water retention when it matters - and nothing does that better than lots of organic material added to the soil annually. The solution is not to dig it in but to mulch all bare soil every year with a thick layer of home-made compost. </p> <p>The no-diggers will cry victory, but not disturbing the soil is only one part of the complicated equation. Bonfires should be seen as a last resort and the ash put back into the ground. Compost everything. All of us should use as little mechanical energy as possible. This is not a matter of self-consciously attaining sufficient brownie points to reach an organic, recycling, eco-heaven but simply a question of harnessing our resources and dealing with those things at home that we are best dealing with rather than leaving it to politicians to make more of a mess of. </p> <p>None of this will make the weather better. At best it will stop it getting worse. If we all really make a difference it is likely to slow the rate of decline. So for the rest of our lives we have to adapt and get used to it. There will be some real advantages. The milder winters will mean that we will increasingly be able to grow plants out of doors that have formerly been considered too tender. Wet and boggy gardening is interesting and has a huge range of plants. The hotter summers will mean that fruit and vegetables that need heat to ripen, such as peppers, tomatoes and all top fruit, will become easier to grow outside and set fruit more freely in milder spring weather. </p> <p>The point is that everything changes. There is no going back. It is time to stop whingeing about global warming and to make it better while making the most of the opportunities that arise from the change.</p>",

That means fewer jobs and fewer display ads, especially in computing and internet start-ups. Thus far, ironically, the net has provided succour for the clunky old media because it has needed to get its initial messages across in the traditional way, on paper. Retreat and retrenchment in cyberspace may mean a longer-term silver lining for Fleet Street, but there'll be short-term holes in the revenue books. </p> <p>Pincer two is an even more venerable blast from an inflationary past. The newsprint manufacturers have finally got their act together. Paper mills are closing, theoretically for ever, so supply and demand will fit more closely - no more surplus production swilling around. Prices can go up again, perhaps by 15 or 20 per cent. A short-term canyon on the costs side. </p> <p>Now nothing, of course, is certain. Western economies, after nearly a decade of growth, may make a soft landing which does no more than blow a coating of froth away. And, even if they don't, a steep recession in the US would rapidly cause less newsprint usage and thus more flexible pricing. (The paper mills have an uncanny reputation for getting their timing wrong). But suppose what we slowly begin to see happening is what, by the middle of 2001, we get. Suppose the pincers close. </p> <p>Then a grim, ancestral logic takes over. Newspapers have two key sources of revenue. One is advertising, the other is the pence you push over a newsagent's counter. That's a constant balancing act. You can keep your cover price down if the ad take goes up - or vice-versa. But you can't just sit there and do nothing if rising costs and falling ads are hacking into profit margins. Something has to give, and - staff layoffs and hiring freezes of the kind lately imposed by Rupert Murdoch apart - it can only be cover prices. </p> <p>Nobody has talked much about upwardly mobile cover prices since seven years ago - when the Times started a broadsheet price war which, at one stage, delivered your morning Thunderer for 10p. The cost of Saturday papers has edged up since (with added supplements to sweeten the pill) and there's been cautious movement in the red-top tabloid and middle markets. </p> <p>But, at root, the price war isn't over. The Guardian, Independent and Telegraph are stuck, through the week, in the same headline price rut (with the Telegraph, in particular, bobbing and weaving through 400,000 bulk, discounted or subscription copies): the Times, at 35p, is still below its 1993 level. </p> <p>An unhealthy equation. The most prudent broadsheet revenue balance is some where in the 60 per cent ads and 40 per cent sales revenue area, a rough balance with scope for fine tuning; but such equilibrium went missing through the buoyant Nineties. Reckon something more like 70 per cent to 30 per cent today - with 80:20 not too far over the horizon. You don't need a doctorate in statistics to see the problem. </p> <p>Because the sales revenue slice is so much smaller, proportionately, it must rise far higher and more sharply to compensate for any fall in ad revenue. A fall of \u00a310 million-\u00a320m in the ad take may represent only a minor drop, but compensating action at the cover price end would need to be brutal. </p> <p>What would it mean? Circulation drops which may not wear off if everyone was tugging the same price lever. Those fine citizens who buy two or three morning papers would content themselves with one or two. A shrinking market. </p> <p>The difficult fact, however, is that the market has been shrinking without any of these pressures. Go back to November 1992, before the wars began, and compare those figures with figures of November 2000. Only three nationals - the Mail, the FT and the Times - are doing better: some of the falls, for the Express, Independent and Mirror especially, are woundingly steep. The broadsheets doing direct battle with the Times have at best held their ground, but the Times itself has suffered since going up to 35p. </p> <p>Scant reassurance here. A return to necessarily harsh cover price rises would be hell for the circulation managers and thus, later on, for the ad managers: but what other recourse is there? </p> <p>Stark dilemmas have a natural tendency to grow fuzzier in practice, of course. There will be some lowering of profits, of the kind just announced at Associated Newspapers. There will be parings back and decreased paginations. Not the end of the world: Fleet Street, when it digs into its memory bank, is used to surviving lean years. </p> <p>But the strain is always greatest for the papers at the bottom of their particular market league. It is they who get knocked off ad schedules first, they who have fewer readers they can afford to lose. That could be very bad news for Richard Desmond and his Express stable, all flat bottom of their respective leagues and, in the ides of December, taking fresh hits from a rampant Mail. It will also bring nil comfort to the two Independents (though Tony O'Reilly is made of sterner newspaper stuff than Desmond). </p> <p>The fascinating thing, though, is also the most obvious. What about ventures such as the Mail's Metro string of freesheets launched in cities across Britain? On the one hand, making rapid progress; on the other hand, lacking any cover price to raise. It's no fun when your 'free' sheet suddenly costs 20 per cent more and the ad stream has dwindled to a trickle. Watch this and adjacent spaces, and pray for an infinitely cushioned landing.</p>",

Nobody has talked much about upwardly mobile cover prices since seven years ago - when the Times started a broadsheet price war which, at one stage, delivered your morning Thunderer for 10p. The cost of Saturday papers has edged up since (with added supplements to sweeten the pill) and there's been cautious movement in the red-top tabloid and middle markets. But, at root, the price war isn't over. The Guardian, Independent and Telegraph are stuck, through the week, in the same headline price rut (with the Telegraph, in particular, bobbing and weaving through 400,000 bulk, discounted or subscription copies): the Times, at 35p, is still below its 1993 level. An unhealthy equation. The most prudent broadsheet revenue balance is some where in the 60 per cent ads and 40 per cent sales revenue area, a rough balance with scope for fine tuning; but such equilibrium went missing through the buoyant Nineties. Reckon something more like 70 per cent to 30 per cent today - with 80:20 not too far over the horizon. You don't need a doctorate in statistics to see the problem. Because the sales revenue slice is so much smaller, proportionately, it must rise far higher and more sharply to compensate for any fall in ad revenue. A fall of \u00a310 million-\u00a320m in the ad take may represent only a minor drop, but compensating action at the cover price end would need to be brutal. What would it mean? Circulation drops which may not wear off if everyone was tugging the same price lever. Those fine citizens who buy two or three morning papers would content themselves with one or two. A shrinking market. The difficult fact, however, is that the market has been shrinking without any of these pressures. Go back to November 1992, before the wars began, and compare those figures with figures of November 2000. Only three nationals - the Mail, the FT and the Times - are doing better: some of the falls, for the Express, Independent and Mirror especially, are woundingly steep. The broadsheets doing direct battle with the Times have at best held their ground, but the Times itself has suffered since going up to 35p. Scant reassurance here. A return to necessarily harsh cover price rises would be hell for the circulation managers and thus, later on, for the ad managers: but what other recourse is there? Stark dilemmas have a natural tendency to grow fuzzier in practice, of course. There will be some lowering of profits, of the kind just announced at Associated Newspapers. There will be parings back and decreased paginations. Not the end of the world: Fleet Street, when it digs into its memory bank, is used to surviving lean years. But the strain is always greatest for the papers at the bottom of their particular market league. It is they who get knocked off ad schedules first, they who have fewer readers they can afford to lose. That could be very bad news for Richard Desmond and his Express stable, all flat bottom of their respective leagues and, in the ides of December, taking fresh hits from a rampant Mail. It will also bring nil comfort to the two Independents (though Tony O'Reilly is made of sterner newspaper stuff than Desmond). The fascinating thing, though, is also the most obvious. What about ventures such as the Mail's Metro string of freesheets launched in cities across Britain? On the one hand, making rapid progress; on the other hand, lacking any cover price to raise. It's no fun when your 'free' sheet suddenly costs 20 per cent more and the ad stream has dwindled to a trickle. Watch this and adjacent spaces, and pray for an infinitely cushioned landing.",

No and yes. </p> <p> No, because the bankruptcy of half-baked fantasy firms does not constitute a definitive test of anything.

They told of one company which employed FedEx to move parcels from one floor of its building to another. Or of a senior manager in another firm who ordered Mont Blanc pens by the gross because he 'kept losing them'. </p> <p>Publicity surrounding the collapse of such preposterous enterprises has diverted attention from the radical economic and social changes being brought about by the net. So yes, all this stuff does matter. Even in the uncool area of online retailing, companies such as Amazon continue to change the commercial landscape. Ask any bricks-and-mortar bookseller. As Bill Davidow, a prominent US venture capitalist, remarked recently: 'There was a tulip business even after the tulip mania.' </p> <p>The internet is bringing far-reaching changes to our economy, in the form of new ways of doing business, greater productivity in important sectors, lower transaction costs as buyers and sellers come together without the intervention of middlemen, new exchanges in which everything from electricity to broadband capacity can be traded efficiently, and increased consumer the power to resist price rises. </p> <p>These developments represent permanent changes to the economic landscape. And the indifferent commercial performance of early Business-to-Business (B2B) exchanges will not reduce the determination of global firms such as Ford, General Motors, Boeing and General Electric to conduct most of their supply-chain transactions online. Why? Because it costs them about $65 to process a paper-based order and less than $5 to do the same thing online - and to an accountant that's the nearest thing in life to a cast-iron argument. </p> <p>So whatever happens to dotcoms, the commercial world will increasingly adopt the net, and anyone who wants to do business with large firms will have to adopt it too. Andy Grove's prediction that 'companies that are not internet companies by 2005 will not be companies at all' is beginning to look like an understatement. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the underlying technology continues to develop and mutate in unexpected and sometimes subversive ways. A little over two years ago a teenager named Shawn Fanning wrote a program for swapping music files over the net. He then founded a company called Napster to provide a central database enabling subscribers to locate MP3 files on other people's machines, and download from those machines if desired. What he created, in effect, was a system which turned computers used by Napster subscribers into mini-servers, doling out MP3 files on request, using what has become known as 'peer to peer' (P2P) networking. </p> <p>In less than 18 months, Napster attracted 38 million members, which made it one of the fastest-growing enterprises in history. And all on the back of a small program hacked out in a teenager's attic. </p> <p>The record companies eventually sued Napster for copyright infringement in a case which has attracted huge amounts of media attention but is, as yet, undecided. From a long-term perspective, however, the fate of Napster is unimportant: in the end it's just another dotcom. What matters is that it has spawned an internet technology - P2P networking - which is potentially as revolutionary as the web. </p> <p>We are rapidly moving to an era when millions of people will have broadband connections to the net via fixed and wireless links. If even a fraction of these newly wired users allow their machines to become P2P hosts, which means acting as servers for particular purposes, none of which need have anything to do with pirated music, the collective power of the net will be enormously amplified, with consequences that we can barely imagine. </p> <p>P2P technologies could unravel the elaborate structure of search engines and portals which dominate today's web, and turn it into a system where resources are much more dispersed and distributed. Ten years ago, Tim Berners-Lee invented the web and turned the world upside down. A decade from now, we may be looking back at the emergence of P2P and saying much the same. In the circumstances, the collapse of Boo.com &amp; Co. seems a price worth paying. </p> <p><br><a href=\"mailto:John.Naughton@observer.co.uk\">John.Naughton@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

So yes, all this stuff does matter. Even in the uncool area of online retailing, companies such as Amazon continue to change the commercial landscape. Ask any bricks-and-mortar bookseller. As Bill Davidow, a prominent US venture capitalist, remarked recently: 'There was a tulip business even after the tulip mania.' The internet is bringing far-reaching changes to our economy, in the form of new ways of doing business, greater productivity in important sectors, lower transaction costs as buyers and sellers come together without the intervention of middlemen, new exchanges in which everything from electricity to broadband capacity can be traded efficiently, and increased consumer the power to resist price rises. These developments represent permanent changes to the economic landscape. And the indifferent commercial performance of early Business-to-Business (B2B) exchanges will not reduce the determination of global firms such as Ford, General Motors, Boeing and General Electric to conduct most of their supply-chain transactions online. Why? Because it costs them about $65 to process a paper-based order and less than $5 to do the same thing online - and to an accountant that's the nearest thing in life to a cast-iron argument. So whatever happens to dotcoms, the commercial world will increasingly adopt the net, and anyone who wants to do business with large firms will have to adopt it too. Andy Grove's prediction that 'companies that are not internet companies by 2005 will not be companies at all' is beginning to look like an understatement. Meanwhile, the underlying technology continues to develop and mutate in unexpected and sometimes subversive ways. A little over two years ago a teenager named Shawn Fanning wrote a program for swapping music files over the net. He then founded a company called Napster to provide a central database enabling subscribers to locate MP3 files on other people's machines, and download from those machines if desired. What he created, in effect, was a system which turned computers used by Napster subscribers into mini-servers, doling out MP3 files on request, using what has become known as 'peer to peer' (P2P) networking. In less than 18 months, Napster attracted 38 million members, which made it one of the fastest-growing enterprises in history. And all on the back of a small program hacked out in a teenager's attic. The record companies eventually sued Napster for copyright infringement in a case which has attracted huge amounts of media attention but is, as yet, undecided. From a long-term perspective, however, the fate of Napster is unimportant: in the end it's just another dotcom. What matters is that it has spawned an internet technology - P2P networking - which is potentially as revolutionary as the web. We are rapidly moving to an era when millions of people will have broadband connections to the net via fixed and wireless links. If even a fraction of these newly wired users allow their machines to become P2P hosts, which means acting as servers for particular purposes, none of which need have anything to do with pirated music, the collective power of the net will be enormously amplified, with consequences that we can barely imagine. P2P technologies could unravel the elaborate structure of search engines and portals which dominate today's web, and turn it into a system where resources are much more dispersed and distributed. Ten years ago, Tim Berners-Lee invented the web and turned the world upside down. A decade from now, we may be looking back at the emergence of P2P and saying much the same. In the circumstances, the collapse of Boo.com &amp; Co. seems a price worth paying. John.Naughton@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Late in 1999, at the University of Colorado in Denver and the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, a strange medical experiment took place. Across the two sites, a group of 40 patients, all suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease, had small holes drilled in their skulls. Half were given foetal cell implants of the brain chemical dopamine - failure to produce it seems to be linked to Parkinson's. The other half were simply patched up again and sent back to the ward. Nothing was done to them. Not that they knew, any more than those who'd had the implants knew what had been done to them. Both groups had volunteered for a test in which they knew that a hoax might or might not be played on them.</p> <p>This is placebo surgery and - ethics aside for the moment - it's a fascinating avenue for the medical profession to explore. In this case, it seems to have helped demonstrate that the implants do work, though perhaps not as well as hoped.</p> <p>An even stranger placebo surgery experiment took place six years ago at the Veteran Medical Affairs Center in Houston. Ten veterans with arthritic knee pain volunteered to test a procedure. Two of them had the usual surgery - rinsing and scraping of the knee. Three just had rinsing. The other five just got stabbed a few times with a scalpel, then sewn up and sent home. None of them knew which procedure they'd had. Six months later, all of them said they had much less pain. A larger follow-up study has just ended and will report next autumn - and there is no indication that its findings will be different. Doing nothing, it seems, is as good as doing something - in this case, at least.</p> <p>What about those ethics, though? While the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, the Congress of Neurological Surgeons and the Institute of Health have all approved placebo surgery, is it a possibility here? 'Outside our expertise,' says the BMA. 'Don't have a view.' A surgeon was more direct: 'Don't know how they got away with it.' Barry Jackson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said he found it 'very worrying' and that 'there is no way an ethics committee would pass that here because of the risks to the patient.' On the other hand, he added, 'The placebo effect is a real one, though no one knows how it works.'</p> <p>The word placebo is Latin and came to medical science, via a diverse route, from the first words of the Catholic prayer for the dead, Placebo Domino ('I shall please the Lord'). Here, though, it's not God who's being pleased but the physician. Originally, a placebo was the pejorative word for professional mourner. By extension it came to mean doing something to please someone else. By the early 19th century, it had acquired its modern, specifically medical meaning - something 'given more to please than benefit the patient'. Which, of course, was pretty much the extent of medical science in those days. Lizard's blood, donkey's hooves, crocodile dung and blood-letting leeches are nothing if not placebos.</p> <p>The effect was first formally recognised in 1946, by Gold and Garb, at a pain-prevention seminar. Their study showed that it could reverse the effect of a potent drug. Volunteer subjects were given ipecac, an emetic, but told it was an anti-nausea drug - they didn't get sick. A decade later, HK Beecher evaluated more than two dozen studies and calculated that about one-third of us are susceptible to the effect. Others have found twice that rate.</p> <p>In the words of the most up-to-date general reference work, the Encylopedia of Psychology (\u00a3650, OUP): 'Many are the research trials in which the placebo response has been almost indistinguishable from the substance or agent under consideration.' It then lists some, though not all, of the conditions on which placebos have been demonstrably effective: angina, blood pressure, colds, coughs, fever, panic disorder, psychiatric conditions, psoriasis, insomnia, pain, rheumatoid arthritis, the effects of various vaccines and warts.</p> <p>Warts? That's right. Doctors got rid of them by painting them with an inert dye and telling the patients that when the colour wore out, the warts would be gone.</p> <p>In 1959, a young American heart specialist, Leonard Cobb, had his doubts about a then-common procedure used for angina - internal mammary litigation. The patient's chest was cut and knots were tied in two arteries. It had a seeming success rate of 90 per cent. Cobb tried cutting the chest but not bothering with the knots. It worked just as well.</p> <p>Little in medicine isn't party to the placebo effect, it seems. 'Any credible, socially accepted treatment administered in an appropriate context will have a modest therapeutic success,' according to a psychology textbook.</p> <p>Recent studies cast doubt on the genuine efficacy of antidepressants. The title of Irving Kirsch and Guy Sapirstein's 1998 paper tells it all: 'Listening to Prozac but hearing placebo'. Merck abandoned its MK-869 antidepressant when it emerged that it worked no better than fake pills. Nor is it just antidepressants. In 1999, a highly touted allergy vaccine produced by Peptide Therapeutics turned out to be no more effective than a placebo. And a genetically engineered heart drug actually produced worse results than the placebo.</p> <p>Placebo effect is also graduated. 'The more grand the scenario, the greater its power,' said a surgeon. 'A few tablets don't have as much effect as going for a procedure at a big institute with loads of kit.' Or, as a research scientist put it in the New York Times : 'The bigger and more dramatic the patient perceives the intervention to be, the bigger the placebo effect. Big pills have more effect than small pills, injections have more effect than pills, and surgery has the most of all.'</p> <p>'The great masses of the people,' said another expert, 'will more easily fall victim to a great lie than to a small one.' That's Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf , chapter 10.</p> <p>The placebo effect is deeply weird, almost unbelievable in some of its details. One, a placebo's strength is proportional to the strength of the active substance - ie, it's as powerful as the real drug it's being tested or measured against. Two, its side effects are often similar. Three, its time course is similar - that is, its effect often peaks about an hour later, at about the same time as the real drug. Four, dose effect is similar - by extension, big placebos can 'work' better than small 'real' pills. It works well for opiate addicts and those on long-term heavy analgesia programmes. In both cases, replacing the active drug or drugs with a saline solution can eliminate dependence.</p> <p>Conversely, there are reports of placebo addiction. Nor does it have to be something obviously medical - a placebo stress-buster tape worked well when subjects were told it had been used on astronauts, while in fact it had just been selected by another group as 'boring'. And, impossible as it may seem, it really does seem to heal. The intestines of sick patients given placebos were examined and found to have improved.</p> <p>There is obviously something very important going on here. Can we somehow trap it and use it? Is it possible that the future of medical care lies in its own unscientific past? That one of the best, most productive, cheapest and least dangerous ways of healing patients is to tell them a whole bunch of lies, the bigger the better? One of the great classical doctors, Galen, wrote in AD 300: 'He cures most in whom most are confident.' Did he know more than us?</p> <p>There is no doubt the placebo effect is something deep with meaning for all of us, possibly a harbinger of a whole new approach to medical science, but it is also damnably hard to analyse. Its significance is easily grasped, but its mechanics are seemingly as far beyond our understanding as they were when they were first noted - way back in pre-history, probably long before written records began. All those donkey's hooves, all those snake-oil serums, all that blood-letting - no scientific effects anywhere, but the patients got better, didn't they?</p> <p>Well, some of them did. As do those who use homeopathy and crystals today. With those and many - though not all - alternative medicines, there are just two possible explanations. One, the laws of physics cease to apply - there is literally nothing active in many alternative medicines. Or two, that the placebo effect is at work.</p> <p>How does it work? Clearly, part of its efficacy is simply a measure of the natural course of the body healing itself - with modern intervention, that is something of an unstudied rarity. Partly, it's that it gives the patient the authorised licence to cease playing the part of the patient. Other studies link it to what psychologists call classical conditioning - the Pavlov stuff. As Pavlov's ringing bell got the dog salivating, so the medical practitioner giving the patient a pill produces a classically conditioned response - in this case, getting better.</p> <p>Perhaps most importantly, it works because it's given to us by someone in authority. Trust me, I'm a doctor. Even, it seems, when it's a doctor who gives us antibiotics for a viral infection - the most common of modern placebos, probably, and no more effective than crocodile dung.</p> <p>Whatever - half a century after Gold and Garb's experiment, the medical world is finally waking up to the arresting possibilities offered by the placebo effect. Lizard's blood, anyone?</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Dr Craig Venter, Celera Genomics, Maryland</strong><br> <strong>Specialism:</strong> the human genome<br> <strong>Predicts:</strong> genetic print outs for babies; reduced deaths from diseases like cancer; reduced medical costs</p> <p>'Some time this century, when parents leave hospital with a new baby, they will take with them a genetic print out. It will include computer predictions of high-risk diseases, suggestions about the chemicals and foods in the environment that the child should avoid, and the kind of lifestyle that will promote their child's health and longevity. </p> <p>At the same time, the parents must be sure that there are laws which prevent the baby's genetic code from ever being used as a weapon against it - so that the knowledge will only benefit its life. They also need to understand that genes hardly ever predict a disease with absolute certainty; they can only give an indication of risk. </p> <p>Our research is teaching us that genetic determinism simply doesn't work. There are many factors - in our food, the environment, our social lives - that can take our genes in lots of different directions. So, our genetic make-up shouldn't be viewed as a limitation, but instead as a potential for achieving a healthier and disease-free future. </p> <p>I suspect that there will be a big impact on the food industry. People differ. Some have fast metabolisms and can eat a lot without putting on weight, others don't. So I foresee tailored diets becoming more common. </p> <p>At Celera, we are now working on the detection of proteins in the blood, which will give the very earliest indication of the onset of colon and breast cancer - when the diseases are still treatable, perhaps even without chemotherapy. This is going to have a huge impact, even with just those two diseases. </p> <p>Today, virtually everybody knows someone who has died from cancer. There are a million people diagnosed with cancer in the US every year. I hope my work and discoveries will make that a thing of the past. With the intelligent use of genetic and protein information, our healthcare costs will go down exponentially. </p> <p>But there won't be miracle cures. It's very unlikely that we will find a single defective gene and just replace it, like putting in a new spark plug. There are 100 trillion cells in the body, and that's a lot of spark plugs. Nor will the genetic information be used to determine what job you can or cannot get, because nothing in terms of intelligence or ability will ever be precisely predictable by genes. </p> <p>Perhaps the most important issue to deal with today, worldwide, is the need to avoid genetic discrimination. That's why we've been working with the US Congress to try to get new bills passed to prevent genetic information being used against people. </p> <p>Despite these challenges, I believe that the discovery of the genetic code in 2000 will be viewed as a bright line in history. For me, it is the first step in finding out what it really means to be alive - not with a body that functions like a machine, but with a body full of living potential, in a world of biodiversity of such scope we can only just glimpse it.' </p> <p><strong>Martin Rees, Royal Society Astronomer, Cambridge</strong><br> <strong>Specialism:</strong> origins of the universe<br> <strong>Predicts:</strong> people on Mars; permanent lunar base; tourism in space</p> <p> 'I am confident that there will be a permanent lunar base and a manned exploration of Mars sometime this century. Whether it's going to be within 20 years or 50 years is hard to predict. This would depend on whether there's either political pressure, as was in the case of the Apollo programme to send a man to the moon, or if the techniques are cheap enough to be done by private enterprise or individual adventurers. </p> <p>Tourism in space will happen some time this century. But space flight will only be affordable when it adopts the same techniques as supersonic aircraft, and the craft does not have to be rebuilt after every takeoff. Tourist trips into orbit may then become routine for wealthy adventurers. I expect there will be self-sustained groups of people living away from the earth. A lunar colony couldn't be justified by science alone, but if it were established for other reasons it would offer superb scientific opportunities. The near-vacuum of the moon's surface offers a superb location for telescopes, and would enable radio astronomers a quiet site free from the interference of worldwide mobile phone satellites from which to pick up the faint hissing from cosmic objects. It would inspire continuing public interest - indeed, the risk would be a Truman Show exposure. How long it will take, I'm not sure. </p> <p>Twenty years from now I would fully expect we will know what planets are orbiting hundreds of stars. So when we look into the sky, a star will not just be a point of light but we'll be able to say what planets are around it. I think within 20 years there will be samples returned from Mars, and there'll have been explorations of Europa (one of the moons of Jupiter) and Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) with robotic probes. The key question will be: are there any planets that are like earth? And if there are, has life evolved on those planets? No one is optimistic of finding intelligent life elsewhere. </p> <p>The quest of the 21st century will be to go back even further still and understand and explain why the universe is expanding, and why it contains the mixture of atoms and radiation that we find. </p> <p>There will be a lot of discussion about not just the first second, but the first fraction of a second. But we need a fairly major breakthrough in physics before we'll be able to progress any further. The main challenge in fundamental physics is to develop a unified understanding, a synthesis between Einstein's theory of gravity and quantum theory. I predict that this will involve new concepts, like extra dimensions beyond the normal three dimensions. So previously held intuitions about space and time would have to be jettisoned.' </p> <p><strong>Admiral Richard Truly, director of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Colorado</strong><br> <strong>Specialism:</strong> novel energy sources <br> <strong>Predicts:</strong> hydrogen fuel; nuclear waste dumps in outer space; bio mass generators in the back garden</p> <p> 'I think of the 20th century as the century of the internal combustion engine. The 21st century will be the age of the hydrogen economy. Hydrogen is a very powerful, very clean fuel. If you take a fuel cell - a type of battery which burns hydrogen and air to make electricity - the exhaust is hot, distilled water, without all the pollutants that are discharged from a combustion engine. But at this point there are a number of technical problems which need to be overcome, including safe storage, because hydrogen is highly flammable. The other problem is cost. We are trying to develop cells which are cheap enough to power automobiles. </p> <p>We've also been working on what is called bio-mass - turning natural materials like wood chips, grass or the residue from agricultural crops into fuels that can be used to power vehicles that are not reliant on petroleum. You would eventually have a bio-refinery that is not unlike today's oil refinery, but much greener. Ultimately, we will enjoy a more sustainable energy position at the end of this century than at the beginning. </p> <p>I can imagine people having a bio-mass generator in the backyard, but it's several decades down the technology track. </p> <p>One day entire countries or regions could be energy independent. We are already developing solar cells or photovoltaics, but the challenge is to develop ways of making these cells more affordable so that it could be possible to tap into their light energy any time, anywhere. </p> <p>It is technically feasible that nuclear power plants could be built in space. But I don't know if that it is something the public would accept because of the possibility of launch accidents. That's not to say technology couldn't make such an event safe enough.' </p> <p><strong>Dr Tom Okarma, president and CEO of Geron Corporation, California</strong><br> <strong>Specialism:</strong> bio-medicine<br> <strong>Predicts:</strong> artificial organs; human nerve cells for sale in chemists'</p> <p> 'In 10 to 20 years' time, we think we will be able to build new organs artificially and replace an entire organ with something synthetic. So whenever someone's health is compromised by a specific organ dysfunction, which is 75 to 80 per cent of people, we'll have the technology to support them. Heart failure, strokes, cirrhosis, loss of kidney function and diabetes could all be treated. </p> <p>But this therapeutic organ cloning will not increase our life span because, no matter what you replace, we will all eventually collapse. People who live to 110 will still die in their sleep because so many of their life support systems fail. In three to five years, human clinical trials of cell therapy - using living cells as pills - will begin. We are already making these in the lab and testing on animals. </p> <p>We believe it will eventually be possible to walk into a pharmacy and buy human nerve cells which can then be injected into areas of degeneration in the nervous system. </p> <p>The human embryonic stem cell can already be cloned. We can engineer it using gene-targetting technologies to make that cell grow into all the cells and tissues of the body, so as to go undetected by the immune system and therefore not be rejected - a major stumbling block of organ-transplant operations. </p> <p>We've already made heart muscle cells. These would be universal, and could therefore be taken off the shelf and injected into the portion of a damaged heart to restore its pumping ability. These cells could be made for virtually any organ of the body.' </p> <p><strong>Ron Barrett, Alumni Associate Professor, Aerospace Engineering, Auburn University, Alabama</strong><br> <strong>Specialism:</strong> smart materials<br> <strong>Predicts:</strong> aerial vehicles; self-repairing cars; treating inoperable cancers </p> <p> 'It is possible that within 50 to 80 years, families will not have a car but an aerial vehicle. Owners would wheel it out of the garage and take off vertically. Most would fly below 3,000ft, but there is no engineering reason why they couldn't fly at altitudes of up to 80,000ft. A two-seater aerial vehicle would be saucer-shaped, 15-20ft in diameter, and travel at speeds up to 320kph. An in-built computer would link the aerial vehicle to air traffic control systems, and if propulsion failed, they would be able to glide to earth, just as some helicopters are already able to. </p> <p>One of the building blocks for the development of aerial vehicles is adaptive materials, which we are working on at Auburn. These structures are capable of changing their shape when applied with heat, electrical signals or magnetic fluids. The materials would be able to repair themselves and adapt in shape, to operate in much the same way that muscles act in birds and insects. </p> <p>In 15 to 20 years, it's possible that the bodywork of cars could be made from adaptive materials, in which case dents could self-repair. </p> <p>Adaptive materials will also be used in hospitals, eventually allowing outpatient treatment of a wide range of health problems, from heart attacks to cancers considered inoperable. For example, a brain cancer could be treated by using adaptive materials to guide a probe through the arteries to the brain and using it to emit strong sound waves to kill tumours. </p> <p>Another project under development uses adaptive materials to make artificial skeletal muscle tissue which looks, feels and works like real body parts. Because adaptive materials can go from the flexibility of a rubber band to the stiffness of steel in under a 100th of a second, they may be combined with stress-sensitive material to prevent sports injuries, from sprained fingers to broken necks.' </p> <p><strong>Dr Vilanayur Ramachandram, professor of psychology and director of the Centre of Human Information Processing, San Diego</strong><br> <strong>Specialism:</strong> neuroscience<br> <strong>Predicts:</strong> hundreds more mental diseases; an understanding of human nature</p> <p> 'I think the next big scientific frontier is the brain and mind. Human beings are driven by a curiosity to understand cosmology, the universe, physics, biology, genetics, but we still don't know ourselves. What is human nature? That's the ultimate question and that's going to answered this century. </p> <p>By advances in brain imaging [which allow us to investigate what real brains are up to in the real world - as opposed to studying dead brains - through a process of placing them in a static magnetic field and observing oxygen flow], we are going to find many more transmitters and receptors in the brain than was previously believed. How these affect our attitudes, emotions or sexuality, for instance, will be established. </p> <p>People think a love of art and poetry is humanity, but it is anatomical science. This will be proven in the next few years. We know artists and poets in normal circumstances have a higher insulin percentage. The reason might be that they have a gene mutation which causes more connections between different brain areas, so there is more cross-wiring than with others. Brain imaging has shown us that highly creative people can make these intuitive leaps and connections which you and I cannot. If you start with this sort of phenomena, you can go all the way to explaining Shakespeare. </p> <p>'We are close to resolving what have thus far been educated guesses, such as the idea of the emotion of disgust being rooted in anatomy. With advanced brain imaging scans showing in colours the activity of different parts of the brain, we can make more exact predictions on the brain functions. </p> <p>'Psychiatry is such a primitive science at the moment. As we understand more of the complexities of the mind, we will discover that there are not only half a dozen diseases of the mind, there are probably hundreds.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>'Any fool can create a boom or engineer a recession. The art is to avoid these extremes.' These words have echoed in my ears ever since they were uttered by a senior Conservative Minister during the early Eighties - it was a time when the British economy was deep in recession and 'market economics' was not quite as popular as it subsequently became. </p> <p>Keynesian economics, or the deliberate management of demand in the economy, developed out of the manifest excesses of the marketplace and the business cycle during the Twenties and Thirties. The business cycle is the tendency for every company in a particular business to expand or contract at the same time in the face of market development, thereby making an expansion get out of hand, or deepening a contraction to the point where panic sets in. </p> <p>But this applies not only to every company already in a business. New entrants are hit as well - attracted by the boom conditions and the prospects of endless profits and ever-rising share prices. We have seen something of this sort in the antics of internet stocks during 2000. </p> <p>Macro-economic policy - the management of demand - was not developed as an anti-market device; and Keynes himself was certainly not anti-market. But Keynes observed, as did others, the way in which markets tended to behave when left to themselves. </p> <p>The architects of post-1945 demand management policies were also well aware of the dangers of misguided macro-economic policies. Thus, if it was the excesses of the private sector that created the conditions for the Wall Street Crash of 1929, it was ill-judged monetary policy that served to exacerbate the Depression, rather than mitigate its impact. </p> <p>Output in the US fell by a third during the Great Depression. Unemployment rose to over 20 per cent in many countries. When we talk about recession and 'crises' these days we need a sense of perspective. There has been nothing quite like a Thirties-style Depression in the advanced Western industrial economies since 1945, although some South-east Asian countries have suffered Depression conditions in recent years. </p> <p>Of course, in order to have macro-economic policies you need to have an economy. The kind of market-orientated and open-economy policies urged on Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 were wholly inappropriate. Keynes was a great believer in the control of capital movements, because he had seen what damage large international movements of capital had wreaked in the Thirties. Among his essential insights were that hoarding - excessive saving - can damage a nation's economy; and that international hoarding - the sudden withdrawal of funds - can also cause chaos, as Asia has witnessed in recent years. </p> <p>The lesson has not been lost on Japanese policy-makers, whose links with south-east Asian markets are close. Japan is working on plans to make east Asia and the Pacific Basin less vulnerable to the vagaries of external capital movements via closer co-ordination between Asian capital markets. </p> <p>But Japan is a classic victim of the excesses of what Gordon Brown calls 'boom and bust' - and its problems have been increased by poor macro-economic policy. </p> <p>Having taken years to recover from the bursting of its Eighties 'bubble economy', Japanese policy-makers raised taxes and killed the recovery in 1997, and this year the Bank of Japan ended its zero interest rate policy too soon, thereby prolonging fears of serious deflation. </p> <p>The Japanese economy accounts for 12.5 per cent of the total gross domestic product of the member nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. These are the leading industrial market economies of the world, and Japan is the third biggest. What happens in Japan in 2001 is a subject of growing concern. </p> <p>What happens in the US is of even greater concern. At 37.1 per cent of OECD GDP, the US is still the world's largest economy, compared with 26.1 per cent for the eurozone, and 33.5 per cent for the entire European Union. </p> <p>The big question now is whether, just as President Bill Clinton inherited from George Bush an economy that had recovered from recession, George W. Bush has inherited an economy that is going into recession - it is not there yet - from Clinton.

      "bodyText": "'Any fool can create a boom or engineer a recession. The art is to avoid these extremes.' These words have echoed in my ears ever since they were uttered by a senior Conservative Minister during the early Eighties - it was a time when the British economy was deep in recession and 'market economics' was not quite as popular as it subsequently became. Keynesian economics, or the deliberate management of demand in the economy, developed out of the manifest excesses of the marketplace and the business cycle during the Twenties and Thirties. The business cycle is the tendency for every company in a particular business to expand or contract at the same time in the face of market development, thereby making an expansion get out of hand, or deepening a contraction to the point where panic sets in. But this applies not only to every company already in a business. New entrants are hit as well - attracted by the boom conditions and the prospects of endless profits and ever-rising share prices. We have seen something of this sort in the antics of internet stocks during 2000. Macro-economic policy - the management of demand - was not developed as an anti-market device; and Keynes himself was certainly not anti-market. But Keynes observed, as did others, the way in which markets tended to behave when left to themselves. The architects of post-1945 demand management policies were also well aware of the dangers of misguided macro-economic policies. Thus, if it was the excesses of the private sector that created the conditions for the Wall Street Crash of 1929, it was ill-judged monetary policy that served to exacerbate the Depression, rather than mitigate its impact. Output in the US fell by a third during the Great Depression. Unemployment rose to over 20 per cent in many countries. When we talk about recession and 'crises' these days we need a sense of perspective. There has been nothing quite like a Thirties-style Depression in the advanced Western industrial economies since 1945, although some South-east Asian countries have suffered Depression conditions in recent years. Of course, in order to have macro-economic policies you need to have an economy. The kind of market-orientated and open-economy policies urged on Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 were wholly inappropriate. Keynes was a great believer in the control of capital movements, because he had seen what damage large international movements of capital had wreaked in the Thirties. Among his essential insights were that hoarding - excessive saving - can damage a nation's economy; and that international hoarding - the sudden withdrawal of funds - can also cause chaos, as Asia has witnessed in recent years. The lesson has not been lost on Japanese policy-makers, whose links with south-east Asian markets are close. Japan is working on plans to make east Asia and the Pacific Basin less vulnerable to the vagaries of external capital movements via closer co-ordination between Asian capital markets. But Japan is a classic victim of the excesses of what Gordon Brown calls 'boom and bust' - and its problems have been increased by poor macro-economic policy. Having taken years to recover from the bursting of its Eighties 'bubble economy', Japanese policy-makers raised taxes and killed the recovery in 1997, and this year the Bank of Japan ended its zero interest rate policy too soon, thereby prolonging fears of serious deflation. The Japanese economy accounts for 12.5 per cent of the total gross domestic product of the member nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. These are the leading industrial market economies of the world, and Japan is the third biggest. What happens in Japan in 2001 is a subject of growing concern. What happens in the US is of even greater concern. At 37.1 per cent of OECD GDP, the US is still the world's largest economy, compared with 26.1 per cent for the eurozone, and 33.5 per cent for the entire European Union. The big question now is whether, just as President Bill Clinton inherited from George Bush an economy that had recovered from recession, George W. Bush has inherited an economy that is going into recession - it is not there yet - from Clinton. The dramatic development of recent weeks has been the speed with which confidence in the US economic miracle has evaporated. It was always going to evaporate, but there is nothing new under the sun, and many market participants made fools of themselves during 1999 and 2000 by assuming, via the valuations they placed on so-called new-economy stocks, that 'this time it is different'. The fact of the matter was that the continuation of the US boom required Americans to go on running down their savings and increasing their borrowing at a rate that was unsustainable by the laws of simple arithmetic. Ironically, the boom was probably prolonged by a Federal Reserve that was almost too good at demand management - but only for a time. I remain of the view that Alan Greenspan would have been wise to get out while the going was good, and politely refuse another term. So, with Japan in the doldrums, and the US in danger of experiencing a severe economic hangover, the big question for the year 2001 is: can Europe behave like the big economy it likes to think it is, and not like a group of frightened small economies that traditionally catch a cold when the US sneezes? What Europe needs is the continuation of macro-economic policies that nurture the current recovery, and also counteract the negative impact on our economies of events in the US and Japan. Both Germany and France are indulging in timely tax cuts; the European Central Bank has got to recognise that there are no serious inflationary dangers in the world at large - quite the contrary. The recovery of the euro was bound to happen some time; but beware those excitable markets. It will almost certainly be overdone, in which case the eurozone's exports will suffer. As for the British economy - 5.4 per cent of OECD GDP - we have benefited enormously from the phenomenal boom in world trade led by the US, and this has so far disguised the extent of the damage to our exports caused by the high pound. The pound is now in the course of being devalued, and this will help our medium-term approach to the single currency. Sorry, did I say the pound was being devalued? Surely not before a general election! No, the euro is appreciating?",

      "body": "<p>It is never night inside the Machine. Even after the sun has set on the mesa and Jimmy Potter and the frogmen and the men in white jumpsuits and the men in blue jumpsuits have showered, packed up, and gone home; even as yawning, befuddled scientists - with names like Jim Bailey and Mark Derzon and Melissa Douglas - sit in offices in a nearby building, trapped by their own reflections and in the blackened windows; and even as this oesophageal dark falls over coyote and jackrabbit and moves everything towards sleep and dreams, towards the deepest centre of the night, the Machine is awake.</p> <p>Its 36 Marx generators are set in a ring like a metallic Stonehenge. The 20 Rexolite disks of the vacuum chamber look like flying saucers. Its vast, concentric pool of five-weight oil and deionized water seems bottomless - real oil and real water, in half-million-gallon tanks that sit one inside the other like a wheel within a wheel. Even now, there are depths in the Machine, invisible worlds revealing themselves, the secret body of the universe floating up. Deuterium, tritium, helium.</p> <p>It begins with the flip of a cyber switch in the control room at the north end of the hanger. Before a bank of computer screens, a man clicks a mouse, and then electricity, quietly sucked off the municipal power grid in Albuquerque, floods into the outer ring of Marx generators. Which is when the Machine takes control. A siren sounds, red lights flash, doors automatically lock. The frogmen and the white and blue jumpsuits clamber over the high bay, down metal steps, and retreat to a copper-coated room behind a foot of cement.</p> <p>Another switch is flipped, another mouse clicked. To the piercing sound of an alarm, a countdown in the Marx generators ensues, or rather a count up, in kilovolts, comes in a monotone, almost hollow voice beneath the frantic alarm. The man in the control room on a tinny loudspeaker, the Machine speaking through the human.</p> <p>'Twenty kV...'</p> <p>'Thirty kV...'</p> <p>'Forty kV...'</p> <p>At 90, the floodgates open: a pulse of electricity surges out of the Marx generators toward an inside ring of giant capacitors and then through a series of gas switches. The current is compressed by the Machine into a wild whitewater of electricity that charges toward the vacuum chamber at a speed of 60 million feet per second. On its way, it passes through painted sharks' mouths, drawn there by the men in white and blue jumpsuits in the way that fighter pilots sometimes draw on their warplanes to show their prowess - or hide their misgivings. The electricity pours past the sharks' mouths, is redirected downward, along the Z axis, into the vacuum chamber, blitzing and bombarding from all sides a three-dimensional target in a gold-plated can, a delicately strung array of tungsten wires the size of a spool of thread, hanging in black space like a tiny chandelier.</p> <p>Driven so furiously in the Machine, and then storming the array, the pulse of electricity - enough juice now to light up America like a birthday cake - instantly vapourises the tungsten wire into plasma, a superheated ion gas. The ions hover and dance along the invisible circumference once described by the array, while a relentless magnetic field keeps pressing on them, shoving them from behind. Thrusting and squeezing and ramming until the ions can no longer resist, the centre cannot hold, and in that hot nanosecond - Boom ! Everything becomes one.</p> <p>This is not a gentle conjunction but a Pandora's box suddenly ripped open by nuclear passion, an orgy of ions. Boom ! Lightning fills the Machine, veins out over the surface of the water. Temperatures flare to those inside the sun. The earth rocks once again. And in few billionths of a second, 290 terawatts - 80 times the power generated on earth at any given time - roar to life inside the Machine.</p> <p>Watching it through a Plexiglas window, you might as well be watching the beginning of the universe. Or the end of it. Contained in that single flash of white light, when the Machine holds the heat and the power of the sun, when the room fills with lightning, there is everything we know - and everything we may become. The 21st century. A world covered by rooms of little suns, generating intense energy and, with it, the possibilities of time travel and galaxy hopping. Peace among nations. Or the end of time as we know it, a hole ripped in the universe by the Machine, something many doomsayers predict, and the earth sucked into oblivion. Our downfall or salvation. A fusion machine they call Z.</p> <p>The magic bean; the Holy Grail: fusion. The idea is to take two isotopes of the hydrogen atom - deuterium and tritium - and mash them together with a little energy, which in turn releases enormous amounts of energy in the form of a single neutron. Contrarily, fission, the method widely employed by today's nuclear reactors, splits heavy uranium and plutonium atoms, creating lots of energy but also tons of dangerous and everlasting radioactive waste. Fusion offers a clean source, borne out of the material of roughly a handful of water and a handful of earth, with its only by-product being an easily disposable helium-4 nucleus.</p> <p>What would fusion mean? Endless, cheap energy. Amazing Star Trek , space-travel possibilities. Fame, fortune, and undoubtedly a Nobel or two for the lucky scientists. For the better part of five decades, the race has two separate approaches: magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. Most researchers - those from Japan, Russia, Europe and America - focus on the former: big accelerators called stellarators, spheromaks, and tokamaks (a machine designed partly by Andrei Sakharov) use huge magnets to contain and compress hydrogen isotopes that hover in a kind of reddish-blue plasma inside the huge torus-shaped tubes until implosion.</p> <p>On the other hand, the idea behind inertial confinement is that tiny fuel pellets of deuterium and tritium are bombarded by lasers or X-rays. In the case of the Z Machine, the explosion that occurs when ions are released by the vapourised wire array, and then when ions are pinched together, creates a huge X-ray pulse, one that scientists hope can be used to heat the tiny pellets and, in turn, create a small thermonuclear explosion. As it is, fusion has never been achieved for an extended time outside the explosion of a hydrogen bomb.</p> <p>The first time scientists attempted to shoot an early incarnation of the Z machine, in June 1980, there was bravado and false bravado and downright fear. At Sandia National Laboratories on Kirtland Air Force Base, in the same New Mexican high-desert landscape of America's greatest, most frightening nuclear discoveries, they'd been working on the Machine for four years. Yet there were still unknown variables, a scientist's nightmare. First, it was so much bigger and more powerful than any of its predecessors. What if the Marx generators blew up before it could be shot? What if residual X-ray radiation contaminated people in the area? Or a fire destroyed the complex? And what if everything worked perfectly and they got a huge energy release that blew up Albuquerque itself? It was a scenario that had been considered at the highest level. As had something worse: what if people later wished that it had been only Albuquerque that blew up?</p> <p>The shot - Sandia shorthand for the firing of the Machine - was scheduled for a Friday night. But then the machine blew a fitting. The technical crew - the frogmen, as well as the men in white and blue jumpsuits - worked feverishly, and by Saturday noon the Machine was ready again. 'No one knew what to expect,' remembers Gerry Yonas, 58, an engineer and physicist and one of the founding fathers of the Z Machine. They took all necessary precautions, charged the Marx generators, and crossed their fingers. A switch was flipped, electricity pulsated into the Machine, ripped through the switches, stormed on to the wires. There was a wicked jolt, and... silence. Sweet, beautiful silence. Everyone was still on earth; everything seemed to work. The feeling was surreal. 'I felt the ground shake,' says Yonas, grinning at the memory, 'and everybody said: \"Let's do it again!\" Nobody wanted to go home. I had to kick them out. There was nowhere else in the world to be. This was the beginning.'</p> <p>The scientists, at that time a group of 20 or so men, threw high fives and drank beer. Pure, silly jubilation. Only later, photographs of what actually had occurred inside the Machine made them gasp: huge dragon snorts of fire filled the hangar. Apparently, plumes of oil had sprayed skyward in the instant of explosion, flamed, and then flamed out before the men returned inside the Machine. They had nearly blown themselves up. By the grace of some benevolent god, or the Machine itself, they were allowed to return to work on Monday morning, giddy limbs intact.</p> <p>Over the next 15 years, the Z Machine gradually improved its output, packing an astonishing wallop - 20 trillion watts' worth of electrical output, as compared with the mea gre 100,000 amps of the first machine - but it wasn't enough. Scientists and theoreticians estimated that for high-yield fusion to be achieved inside the Machine, it would need to generate something over 1,000 trillion watts. A factor of at least 50 of Z's output.</p> <p>Which is when the men in suits and ties tried to kill the Machine. It was a dinosaur, they argued, no longer useful. They felt Z-pinch technology could not yield the mother lode. By 1995, even Yonas, who was about to become a grandfather, was acutely feeling the passage of time. He sadly had to admit that maybe he should sacrifice Z and all the optimism that had driven the project. Perhaps achieving high-yield fusion, something scientists compare to the invention of the lightbulb for its potential to change the world, did indeed belong to the other fusion machines, the stellarators and spheromaks and tokamaks. To the Russians or the Japanese or the British or the confederate nerds at Princeton or Lawrence Livermore or Oak Ridge. And maybe Sandia National Laboratories - over time, a place known more for its secretive mystique, its downright weird nefariousness, dating to the cloak-and-dagger days of Little Boy and Fat Man - would have to sit on the sidelines while someone else gave the world perhaps its greatest legacy.</p> <p>But a funny thing happened on the way to the chop shop. Maybe it was 11th-hour desperation, or some invisible bolt of providence visited on a few overworked scientists, a couple of whom lit on the simple idea of stringing the wire array, the spool-sized target at the centre of the Machine, with double, then triple, the tungsten wire. All of a sudden - Boom ! Forty trillion watts! No one believed it. They reconfigured the Machine, boosting its X-ray production. Then someone, Melissa Douglas, thought to stack the arrays. Boom ! Two hundred trillion watts in a single pulse! Short of a nuclear blast, it was the most energy ever released on earth, and suddenly, in 1998, after five decades of chasing the illusion of high-yield fusion, of regarding it as some far-off Atlantis or dark galaxy's edge, the Z Machine was a third of the way there.</p> <p>In science, if you do something once that's never been done before, it's considered a mistake. Do it twice, and it's simply a mirage. But the third time it becomes the truth. With Z's new, seemingly impossible results came the first flickering sign that some deep, unknowable power resided in the Machine. And so today, the Z Machine is considered one of the world's best hopes for achieving fusion. 'We may not understand how we get these huge pulses of power, the meaning may still elude us,' says Yonas. 'But it's still a fact.'</p> <p>One that Yonas himself, at first, had a hard time grasping. After he was handed the results, he remembers squinting at them, and sitting back at his desk as if blown by a solar wind. 'My God,' he said in a small voice. 'This could work. This could really work.'</p> <p>Listen to the Z scientists, to their best idea ('The use of stark-shifted emissions to measure electric-field fluctuations and acceleration gaps'), and their dream ('To remedy plasmic instability and create higher temp- eratures'), and you enter a kind of friend country that becomes an Andean prison from which it gets harder and harder to escape. The scientists admit that, at moments, their whole selves are inseparable from the Machine, that the pull of the Machine is so great that re-entering normal life can be nearly impossible.</p> <p>Jim Bailey, a handsome, soft-spoken, loafer-wearing plasma physicist whose conversation is peppered with references to spectroscopy and 'the visible regime', says sometimes it's even hard to go to a neighbour's barbecue - can't make small talk, can't communicate what you do - let alone talk to your wife. Mark Derzon, a boyish, bearded nuclear physicist, says he works a system with his wife: when he walks through the door at the end of a day, he says green light ('Yes, everything is fine, I'm ready for the kids'); yellow light ('Give me 15 to decompress'); or red light ('I need time'). Melissa Douglas says that there's no line drawn at all between the Machine and her private life - that the Machine, her place inside of the Machine, studying something called Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, is her private life. And now, at the age of 36, she's watched her friends get married, have families, settle, and on occasion she's wondered to herself: 'what am I doing? Can we really make fusion work?'</p> <p>Since the 1950s, the US government has invested nearly $15bn to find out, always with the promise that fusion is just around the corner - two, three, five years away - and, with it, a fusion revolution that would hurtle us to the centre of the earth, the deepest trenches of the ocean, and the farthest reaches of space. A revolution that would morph the Third World into the First World until we are simply One World.</p> <p>After all, how many wars have been fought over oil? And then, with oil reserves expected to reach full depletion by 2050, how many more will be? Remove oil as a vital component of our speed-driven, chip-fitted age and, sure, people would find things to brawl over, but energy wouldn't be one of them.</p> <p>And with limitless, cheap energy, the development of poorer nations wouldn't be one of them, either.</p> <p>And with development, the have-nots and pariahs of the world would theoretically join the haves, and so food and housing and education wouldn't be one of them.</p> <p>And with a higher standard of living would come a new freedom for humanity. For at its heart, fusion, as a Utopian ideal, has always symbolised freedom; freedom from the mistakes and waste of our past, the Hanford Reservations and the Savannah River Sites - those vast, spooky, radiating underground storage facilities chambered with containers of plutonium and iodine waste, on top of which America is built. Though left unsaid, the race for fusion has always been about democracy or a democratic alternative.</p> <p>And yet one of the biggest threats to fusion comes from the same group of people responsible for the Hanford Reservations and the Savannah River Sites: the US Government. Recently, Congress and various federal agencies have become disenchanted by the fusion dream. Critics have lambasted it as a waste of time and money. If we haven't achieved it in the last 45 years, they argue, we never will. The US has dropped out of a proposed $10bn international fusion project called ITER, leaving the facility in doubt of completion. Meanwhile, the government has spent $3bn, with as much as an additional $43bn to come, on developing Nevada's Yucca Mountain as a vast nuclear-waste site - despite well-documented problems - and continues its commitment to fission reactors despite the fact that radioactive waste can be lethal up to 600 millennia after burial. Leaders in fusion field, like the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, have mothballed their big machines, laid off staff, and now are fighting simply for their own survival.</p> <p>'You have to find a way to justify doing something that you may never see accomplished in your lifetime,' says Jim Bailey, who has a penchant for reading Hume. 'I mean, instead I could be working for a cancer cure, with at least a greater hope of finding one. But I'm OK with this. I've made my peace with it. Fusion will be the greatest scientific achievement of our time.'</p> <p>Yonas, with the Super Bowl confidence of Joe Namath, predicts that usable high-yield fusion will be made available to the American public by an accelerator called X-1, a generation or two beyond Z, within three decades - maybe sooner. Mark Derzon, a member of what's called the Advanced Concepts Group at Z, has designed what would be the first practical Z-pinch reactor - 'A zero-miracle power plant,' he cheerfully proclaims, and believes that the Z technology is rougher and tougher, able to sustain more of the constant rock and roll of such a plant, than are the sensitive lasers and vacuums necessary for magnetic confinement. But optimism usually carries the day only past lunch; the request to draw up preliminary plans for X-1, with its price tag of up to $1bn dollars, is likely to be approved by the Department of Energy.</p> <p>'Every day, it's a leap of faith,' says Neal Singer, a science writer at Sandia. 'Adding wires to the array - where did that idea come from? From the outside it makes no sense. It's incredibly complex and difficult to string tungsten wires 1/10th the diameter of a piece of hair and space them perfectly. And they did it and got tremendous results. Then they added more and more, spaced them a little differently and now we're a third of the way there. It takes these little steps, this day-by-day thinking. Hour after hour. Ten, 12, 14 hours a day. The constant question is, Can you just make a little change to influence the result?'</p> <p>Thus the world inside the Machine is driven down to its smallest, most maddening detail. For in the end, fusion - its possibility and reality, its attainment and capture - comes out of this finely tuned call-and-response with the universe itself, the channelling of some great unknown, copulating force that calls for the perfect alignment of human and Machine. That is, the human culture surrounding the Machine attempts to mimic the Machine itself , which is trying to mimic the universe. The mannerisms of the Machine become the mannerisms of its minions - people rage and tyrannise, overheat, relent, synergise, procreate, vanish, and recur. One idea seems brilliant and fails, while another may start as a quail but then, compressed by other ideas - electrons stripping off, ions colliding - transforms into something sharp and fast, something agitatingly, beautifully right. And then, of course, it is shot into the Machine to see if it is.</p> <p>Still there is Melissa Douglas's nagging doubt, which is the nagging doubt of everyone here. On certain days, it is possible to believe that you are merely trapped in the rubble of some cosmic joke with no punch line, that Godot is eating chilli dogs somewhere and won't be able to make it. After all, Jim Bailey's lab books are full of 13 years' worth of jottings; Mark Derzon has pulled countless all-nighters in the name of what may or may not be the reactor of the future; Melissa Douglas has spent entire months of her life obsessing over a single equation, the pallor of her face reflecting only pale computer light - all of this thought and activity and faith belying the possibility that their efforts might be for nothing. And yet as much as the race for fusion is a race against the Russians at Triniti labs, or the Germans at FZK labs, or other American scientists at Lawrence Livermore, it's also literally a race against the ticking internal clocks of each scientist who entertains the question: will I live to see it?</p> <p>'History forgets the individual,' says Mark Derzon pensively, surrounded by no fewer than 30 photographs of his young daughters. 'One day Plato will be forgotten. Ultimately, the name you make for yourself is not the important thing. It's what you did, what you stood up for, what you acted on. Did you try to make the world a better place? In order to do it, the world needs fusion. I just happen to think that Z is the best way to get there. And we're going to have one serious pizza party around here if it is.'</p> <p>Jimmy Potter stands inside the Machine, glaring down into the half-million-gallon pool of water at the submerged refrigerator-sized capacitors where, he suspects, there may be a broken, bubbling gas switch. Potter, a Texan, is the keeper of the Beast, the man who oversees the whole shebang for today's shot. 'Are those bubbles down there?' he asks out loud, vexed. 'We already sent the divers in. I sure hope not.'</p> <p>If Potter is driven by perfection, then he is merely a reflection of the culture at Sandia National Laboratories. And if the quest for fusion is intensely competitive, Moonily quixotic, and at times downright nasty, then Sandia mirrors, among its myriad projects, many of those same contradictory characteristics. Top secret or otherwise, spread over the dusty 27-square-mile patch of Kirtland Airforce Base, the projects include the training of honeybees to detect land mines, the invention of a foam that kills anthrax, the making of a synthetic sludge, and the perfecting of various micromachines, some so small as to be undetectable by the human eye, which might be used to lock down nuclear weapons. Sandia is the home to Teraflops, the fastest computer in the world, as well as the birthplace of moly-99, a radioactive substance widely used in medical procedures. On the east of the base, behind three rows of concertina wire, is a cluster of foothills rumoured to be now-empty nuclear silos. They seem to stand as a reminder of how closely the isotopes of Thanatos and Eros can be held in the same idea, for it to be a real idea, a saving idea, both have to be there, threatening to undo us and remake us at once. To obliterate and immortalise.</p> <p>Potter couldn't care about all that. 'My job is to work with the personalities here,' he says, now pacing the high bay, twitching with pent-up energy. He slips behind a pig (a radiation shield), and checks a silver box that houses a cryogenic pump. He monitors the tech crew, confers with the lead scientist on the shot, keeps everything running on time. 'You've got your top of the Ivy League class,' he continues. 'You've got prima donnas with huge egos. And you've got technicians who at least graduated high school. Nobody can operate without the other. The first thing that happens with two strong personalities is clash. It's my job to go to one and bring him up and maybe bring the other one down and then bring them together.'</p> <p>Of course, there are days when everything feels charged with Shakespearean plots and counterplots, days when tension fills up around the Machine. All of it is caused by the Machine, which rarely exists, of course, in its aluminum-and-Rexolite grandeur, oblivious. There is head-butting between the young comers kicking with ideas and the upper echelon of Z veterans, who ultimately hold the power here. There are Iagos trying to ice someone else's idea in order to promote their own. (The lab rewards the best with bonuses.)</p> <p>'I've become a lot more aggressive,' says Melissa Douglas, one of only three women among the 60 full-time scientists who work on Z. 'You have to really stand your ground. It was very hard for me to do that at first.' In four years on the project, she remembers her worst day as the one when she delivered a seminar and a colleague heckled her mercilessly. Why? Was she that stupid? Did her PhD in plasma physics and her postdoc at Los Alamos make her that inept? So she took her weakness, her insecurity, her lack, and shot it into the Machine, and it came back as power, 290 terawatts' worth.</p> <p>As have others. Marriage is shot in. Love is shot in. Innocence and experience and numbers are shot in, and come back as something almost holy.</p> <p>While many of these scientists consider themselves agnostic, they are quick to admit that they still find themselves in thrall to the unknown, to the force that pulses through the Machine. 'In a deep sense, I would say that my greatest satisfaction here comes from the act of creation,' says Jim Bailey. 'Because what we're trying to do is create knowledge that didn't exist before. Whether that brings us closer to God or not, I don't know. It brings us closer to an understanding of the universe, and if you want to think of God in those terms, then I suppose you could define it that way.'</p> <p>Melissa Douglas describes the charge of joy she gets from a perfect photograph of a Rayleigh-Taylor instability taken inside the vacuum chamber by a pinhole camera at the moment of the wire array's implosion. 'A beautiful picture!' she says, holding up a snapshot that looks more like a Rorschach test - kind of blobby with spikes and valleys. 'It sounds ridiculous, but when I first saw it I jumped and hopped around the room. Ecstatic. Just amazing. Being around this machine, you can't help but feel awe. The universe is mathematical and, you know, God is a mathematician.'</p> <p>And Jimmy Potter - Jimmy Potter is clearing the high bay as sirens sound for all personnel to vacate the Machine and retreat to the control room. Today's shot will attempt to find a way to bombard the wire array uniformly with electricity, so that each last kilovolt of energy can be accelerated into the Machine and come back as more. 'I mean, how do you explain all this to someone outside of this place?' he says, gesturing toward the Machine. 'We don't make a product that can be sold. You can't really see what's going on on in that vacuum chamber. I usually just tell people I work with X-rays. That we've got a big machine doing big things, and one day we're gonna change your life.'</p> <p>Dawn inside the Machine, and it's silent. The frogmen and the men in white and blue jumpsuits are arriving, shaking off their sleep, downing coffee. Jimmy Potter got the shot last night, downloaded the diagnostics, sent everyone home saying they'd take apart the Machine today, and then drove the half hour to his house, over the mesa and the beautiful landscape, to his wife and kids, trying to forget this place for a few hours. At 5.30am, he was back, rallying the crew, which now has sluggishly begun its work, drilling and hammering at the vacuum chamber.</p> <p>The people of Z admit there's a new inten sity, especially given the Machine's recent exponential gains. There's something to prove - and they need to prove it fast. Plans to win funds to build a cheaper, intermediary machine named ZX, one that will lead to X-1, are the stuff of new worry and hope.

There are times when some Z scientists find it hard not to let there minds wander, to entertain versions of fusion-propelled rockets arcing the local solar systems, of fuel stations on the moon or Io or Pluto, wherever you can pick up a little lithium and water. And there are others who imagine it as the Peace and Love Machine, who've put their trust and idealism for the best possible world in Z. And to get Peace and Love from the Machine, they have to shoot in their souls, holding nothing back.</p> <p>Now the crane groans over its huge tracks above the Machine, preparing to lift off the 8,000lb crown of the vacuum chamber. Last evening, the Machine inhaled the sun, this room filled with lightning, and then everything exploded. Now, when the crown is unbolted, hitched to a hook, and lifted away by the crane, a group of men tentatively peer down into the Machine, goggle-eyed, perhaps expecting to find some traces of gold dust or, more absurdly, a pile of confetti - or, by some miracle of the universe, maybe a fully formed angel, sleeping with its white wings pleached and sooty, its legs twisted under its body, both comical and impossible.</p> <p>So the men look and look, down into the centre of Z, the womb of the Machine, for some message there sent back from the invisible world.

      "bodyText": "It is never night inside the Machine. Even after the sun has set on the mesa and Jimmy Potter and the frogmen and the men in white jumpsuits and the men in blue jumpsuits have showered, packed up, and gone home; even as yawning, befuddled scientists - with names like Jim Bailey and Mark Derzon and Melissa Douglas - sit in offices in a nearby building, trapped by their own reflections and in the blackened windows; and even as this oesophageal dark falls over coyote and jackrabbit and moves everything towards sleep and dreams, towards the deepest centre of the night, the Machine is awake. Its 36 Marx generators are set in a ring like a metallic Stonehenge. The 20 Rexolite disks of the vacuum chamber look like flying saucers. Its vast, concentric pool of five-weight oil and deionized water seems bottomless - real oil and real water, in half-million-gallon tanks that sit one inside the other like a wheel within a wheel. Even now, there are depths in the Machine, invisible worlds revealing themselves, the secret body of the universe floating up. Deuterium, tritium, helium. It begins with the flip of a cyber switch in the control room at the north end of the hanger. Before a bank of computer screens, a man clicks a mouse, and then electricity, quietly sucked off the municipal power grid in Albuquerque, floods into the outer ring of Marx generators. Which is when the Machine takes control. A siren sounds, red lights flash, doors automatically lock. The frogmen and the white and blue jumpsuits clamber over the high bay, down metal steps, and retreat to a copper-coated room behind a foot of cement. Another switch is flipped, another mouse clicked. To the piercing sound of an alarm, a countdown in the Marx generators ensues, or rather a count up, in kilovolts, comes in a monotone, almost hollow voice beneath the frantic alarm. The man in the control room on a tinny loudspeaker, the Machine speaking through the human. 'Twenty kV...' 'Thirty kV...' 'Forty kV...' At 90, the floodgates open: a pulse of electricity surges out of the Marx generators toward an inside ring of giant capacitors and then through a series of gas switches. The current is compressed by the Machine into a wild whitewater of electricity that charges toward the vacuum chamber at a speed of 60 million feet per second. On its way, it passes through painted sharks' mouths, drawn there by the men in white and blue jumpsuits in the way that fighter pilots sometimes draw on their warplanes to show their prowess - or hide their misgivings. The electricity pours past the sharks' mouths, is redirected downward, along the Z axis, into the vacuum chamber, blitzing and bombarding from all sides a three-dimensional target in a gold-plated can, a delicately strung array of tungsten wires the size of a spool of thread, hanging in black space like a tiny chandelier. Driven so furiously in the Machine, and then storming the array, the pulse of electricity - enough juice now to light up America like a birthday cake - instantly vapourises the tungsten wire into plasma, a superheated ion gas. The ions hover and dance along the invisible circumference once described by the array, while a relentless magnetic field keeps pressing on them, shoving them from behind. Thrusting and squeezing and ramming until the ions can no longer resist, the centre cannot hold, and in that hot nanosecond - Boom ! Everything becomes one. This is not a gentle conjunction but a Pandora's box suddenly ripped open by nuclear passion, an orgy of ions. Boom ! Lightning fills the Machine, veins out over the surface of the water. Temperatures flare to those inside the sun. The earth rocks once again. And in few billionths of a second, 290 terawatts - 80 times the power generated on earth at any given time - roar to life inside the Machine. Watching it through a Plexiglas window, you might as well be watching the beginning of the universe. Or the end of it. Contained in that single flash of white light, when the Machine holds the heat and the power of the sun, when the room fills with lightning, there is everything we know - and everything we may become. The 21st century. A world covered by rooms of little suns, generating intense energy and, with it, the possibilities of time travel and galaxy hopping. Peace among nations. Or the end of time as we know it, a hole ripped in the universe by the Machine, something many doomsayers predict, and the earth sucked into oblivion. Our downfall or salvation. A fusion machine they call Z. The magic bean; the Holy Grail: fusion. The idea is to take two isotopes of the hydrogen atom - deuterium and tritium - and mash them together with a little energy, which in turn releases enormous amounts of energy in the form of a single neutron. Contrarily, fission, the method widely employed by today's nuclear reactors, splits heavy uranium and plutonium atoms, creating lots of energy but also tons of dangerous and everlasting radioactive waste. Fusion offers a clean source, borne out of the material of roughly a handful of water and a handful of earth, with its only by-product being an easily disposable helium-4 nucleus. What would fusion mean? Endless, cheap energy. Amazing Star Trek , space-travel possibilities. Fame, fortune, and undoubtedly a Nobel or two for the lucky scientists. For the better part of five decades, the race has two separate approaches: magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. Most researchers - those from Japan, Russia, Europe and America - focus on the former: big accelerators called stellarators, spheromaks, and tokamaks (a machine designed partly by Andrei Sakharov) use huge magnets to contain and compress hydrogen isotopes that hover in a kind of reddish-blue plasma inside the huge torus-shaped tubes until implosion. On the other hand, the idea behind inertial confinement is that tiny fuel pellets of deuterium and tritium are bombarded by lasers or X-rays. In the case of the Z Machine, the explosion that occurs when ions are released by the vapourised wire array, and then when ions are pinched together, creates a huge X-ray pulse, one that scientists hope can be used to heat the tiny pellets and, in turn, create a small thermonuclear explosion. As it is, fusion has never been achieved for an extended time outside the explosion of a hydrogen bomb. The first time scientists attempted to shoot an early incarnation of the Z machine, in June 1980, there was bravado and false bravado and downright fear. At Sandia National Laboratories on Kirtland Air Force Base, in the same New Mexican high-desert landscape of America's greatest, most frightening nuclear discoveries, they'd been working on the Machine for four years. Yet there were still unknown variables, a scientist's nightmare. First, it was so much bigger and more powerful than any of its predecessors. What if the Marx generators blew up before it could be shot? What if residual X-ray radiation contaminated people in the area? Or a fire destroyed the complex? And what if everything worked perfectly and they got a huge energy release that blew up Albuquerque itself? It was a scenario that had been considered at the highest level. As had something worse: what if people later wished that it had been only Albuquerque that blew up? The shot - Sandia shorthand for the firing of the Machine - was scheduled for a Friday night. But then the machine blew a fitting. The technical crew - the frogmen, as well as the men in white and blue jumpsuits - worked feverishly, and by Saturday noon the Machine was ready again. 'No one knew what to expect,' remembers Gerry Yonas, 58, an engineer and physicist and one of the founding fathers of the Z Machine. They took all necessary precautions, charged the Marx generators, and crossed their fingers. A switch was flipped, electricity pulsated into the Machine, ripped through the switches, stormed on to the wires. There was a wicked jolt, and... silence. Sweet, beautiful silence. Everyone was still on earth; everything seemed to work. The feeling was surreal. 'I felt the ground shake,' says Yonas, grinning at the memory, 'and everybody said: \"Let's do it again!\" Nobody wanted to go home. I had to kick them out. There was nowhere else in the world to be. This was the beginning.' The scientists, at that time a group of 20 or so men, threw high fives and drank beer. Pure, silly jubilation. Only later, photographs of what actually had occurred inside the Machine made them gasp: huge dragon snorts of fire filled the hangar. Apparently, plumes of oil had sprayed skyward in the instant of explosion, flamed, and then flamed out before the men returned inside the Machine. They had nearly blown themselves up. By the grace of some benevolent god, or the Machine itself, they were allowed to return to work on Monday morning, giddy limbs intact. Over the next 15 years, the Z Machine gradually improved its output, packing an astonishing wallop - 20 trillion watts' worth of electrical output, as compared with the mea gre 100,000 amps of the first machine - but it wasn't enough. Scientists and theoreticians estimated that for high-yield fusion to be achieved inside the Machine, it would need to generate something over 1,000 trillion watts. A factor of at least 50 of Z's output. Which is when the men in suits and ties tried to kill the Machine. It was a dinosaur, they argued, no longer useful. They felt Z-pinch technology could not yield the mother lode. By 1995, even Yonas, who was about to become a grandfather, was acutely feeling the passage of time. He sadly had to admit that maybe he should sacrifice Z and all the optimism that had driven the project. Perhaps achieving high-yield fusion, something scientists compare to the invention of the lightbulb for its potential to change the world, did indeed belong to the other fusion machines, the stellarators and spheromaks and tokamaks. To the Russians or the Japanese or the British or the confederate nerds at Princeton or Lawrence Livermore or Oak Ridge. And maybe Sandia National Laboratories - over time, a place known more for its secretive mystique, its downright weird nefariousness, dating to the cloak-and-dagger days of Little Boy and Fat Man - would have to sit on the sidelines while someone else gave the world perhaps its greatest legacy. But a funny thing happened on the way to the chop shop. Maybe it was 11th-hour desperation, or some invisible bolt of providence visited on a few overworked scientists, a couple of whom lit on the simple idea of stringing the wire array, the spool-sized target at the centre of the Machine, with double, then triple, the tungsten wire. All of a sudden - Boom ! Forty trillion watts! No one believed it. They reconfigured the Machine, boosting its X-ray production. Then someone, Melissa Douglas, thought to stack the arrays. Boom ! Two hundred trillion watts in a single pulse! Short of a nuclear blast, it was the most energy ever released on earth, and suddenly, in 1998, after five decades of chasing the illusion of high-yield fusion, of regarding it as some far-off Atlantis or dark galaxy's edge, the Z Machine was a third of the way there. In science, if you do something once that's never been done before, it's considered a mistake. Do it twice, and it's simply a mirage. But the third time it becomes the truth. With Z's new, seemingly impossible results came the first flickering sign that some deep, unknowable power resided in the Machine. And so today, the Z Machine is considered one of the world's best hopes for achieving fusion. 'We may not understand how we get these huge pulses of power, the meaning may still elude us,' says Yonas. 'But it's still a fact.' One that Yonas himself, at first, had a hard time grasping. After he was handed the results, he remembers squinting at them, and sitting back at his desk as if blown by a solar wind. 'My God,' he said in a small voice. 'This could work. This could really work.' Listen to the Z scientists, to their best idea ('The use of stark-shifted emissions to measure electric-field fluctuations and acceleration gaps'), and their dream ('To remedy plasmic instability and create higher temp- eratures'), and you enter a kind of friend country that becomes an Andean prison from which it gets harder and harder to escape. The scientists admit that, at moments, their whole selves are inseparable from the Machine, that the pull of the Machine is so great that re-entering normal life can be nearly impossible. Jim Bailey, a handsome, soft-spoken, loafer-wearing plasma physicist whose conversation is peppered with references to spectroscopy and 'the visible regime', says sometimes it's even hard to go to a neighbour's barbecue - can't make small talk, can't communicate what you do - let alone talk to your wife. Mark Derzon, a boyish, bearded nuclear physicist, says he works a system with his wife: when he walks through the door at the end of a day, he says green light ('Yes, everything is fine, I'm ready for the kids'); yellow light ('Give me 15 to decompress'); or red light ('I need time'). Melissa Douglas says that there's no line drawn at all between the Machine and her private life - that the Machine, her place inside of the Machine, studying something called Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, is her private life. And now, at the age of 36, she's watched her friends get married, have families, settle, and on occasion she's wondered to herself: 'what am I doing? Can we really make fusion work?' Since the 1950s, the US government has invested nearly $15bn to find out, always with the promise that fusion is just around the corner - two, three, five years away - and, with it, a fusion revolution that would hurtle us to the centre of the earth, the deepest trenches of the ocean, and the farthest reaches of space. A revolution that would morph the Third World into the First World until we are simply One World. After all, how many wars have been fought over oil? And then, with oil reserves expected to reach full depletion by 2050, how many more will be? Remove oil as a vital component of our speed-driven, chip-fitted age and, sure, people would find things to brawl over, but energy wouldn't be one of them. And with limitless, cheap energy, the development of poorer nations wouldn't be one of them, either. And with development, the have-nots and pariahs of the world would theoretically join the haves, and so food and housing and education wouldn't be one of them. And with a higher standard of living would come a new freedom for humanity. For at its heart, fusion, as a Utopian ideal, has always symbolised freedom; freedom from the mistakes and waste of our past, the Hanford Reservations and the Savannah River Sites - those vast, spooky, radiating underground storage facilities chambered with containers of plutonium and iodine waste, on top of which America is built. Though left unsaid, the race for fusion has always been about democracy or a democratic alternative. And yet one of the biggest threats to fusion comes from the same group of people responsible for the Hanford Reservations and the Savannah River Sites: the US Government. Recently, Congress and various federal agencies have become disenchanted by the fusion dream. Critics have lambasted it as a waste of time and money. If we haven't achieved it in the last 45 years, they argue, we never will. The US has dropped out of a proposed $10bn international fusion project called ITER, leaving the facility in doubt of completion. Meanwhile, the government has spent $3bn, with as much as an additional $43bn to come, on developing Nevada's Yucca Mountain as a vast nuclear-waste site - despite well-documented problems - and continues its commitment to fission reactors despite the fact that radioactive waste can be lethal up to 600 millennia after burial. Leaders in fusion field, like the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, have mothballed their big machines, laid off staff, and now are fighting simply for their own survival. 'You have to find a way to justify doing something that you may never see accomplished in your lifetime,' says Jim Bailey, who has a penchant for reading Hume. 'I mean, instead I could be working for a cancer cure, with at least a greater hope of finding one. But I'm OK with this. I've made my peace with it. Fusion will be the greatest scientific achievement of our time.' Yonas, with the Super Bowl confidence of Joe Namath, predicts that usable high-yield fusion will be made available to the American public by an accelerator called X-1, a generation or two beyond Z, within three decades - maybe sooner. Mark Derzon, a member of what's called the Advanced Concepts Group at Z, has designed what would be the first practical Z-pinch reactor - 'A zero-miracle power plant,' he cheerfully proclaims, and believes that the Z technology is rougher and tougher, able to sustain more of the constant rock and roll of such a plant, than are the sensitive lasers and vacuums necessary for magnetic confinement. But optimism usually carries the day only past lunch; the request to draw up preliminary plans for X-1, with its price tag of up to $1bn dollars, is likely to be approved by the Department of Energy. 'Every day, it's a leap of faith,' says Neal Singer, a science writer at Sandia. 'Adding wires to the array - where did that idea come from? From the outside it makes no sense. It's incredibly complex and difficult to string tungsten wires 1/10th the diameter of a piece of hair and space them perfectly. And they did it and got tremendous results. Then they added more and more, spaced them a little differently and now we're a third of the way there. It takes these little steps, this day-by-day thinking. Hour after hour. Ten, 12, 14 hours a day. The constant question is, Can you just make a little change to influence the result?' Thus the world inside the Machine is driven down to its smallest, most maddening detail. For in the end, fusion - its possibility and reality, its attainment and capture - comes out of this finely tuned call-and-response with the universe itself, the channelling of some great unknown, copulating force that calls for the perfect alignment of human and Machine. That is, the human culture surrounding the Machine attempts to mimic the Machine itself , which is trying to mimic the universe. The mannerisms of the Machine become the mannerisms of its minions - people rage and tyrannise, overheat, relent, synergise, procreate, vanish, and recur. One idea seems brilliant and fails, while another may start as a quail but then, compressed by other ideas - electrons stripping off, ions colliding - transforms into something sharp and fast, something agitatingly, beautifully right. And then, of course, it is shot into the Machine to see if it is. Still there is Melissa Douglas's nagging doubt, which is the nagging doubt of everyone here. On certain days, it is possible to believe that you are merely trapped in the rubble of some cosmic joke with no punch line, that Godot is eating chilli dogs somewhere and won't be able to make it. After all, Jim Bailey's lab books are full of 13 years' worth of jottings; Mark Derzon has pulled countless all-nighters in the name of what may or may not be the reactor of the future; Melissa Douglas has spent entire months of her life obsessing over a single equation, the pallor of her face reflecting only pale computer light - all of this thought and activity and faith belying the possibility that their efforts might be for nothing. And yet as much as the race for fusion is a race against the Russians at Triniti labs, or the Germans at FZK labs, or other American scientists at Lawrence Livermore, it's also literally a race against the ticking internal clocks of each scientist who entertains the question: will I live to see it? 'History forgets the individual,' says Mark Derzon pensively, surrounded by no fewer than 30 photographs of his young daughters. 'One day Plato will be forgotten. Ultimately, the name you make for yourself is not the important thing. It's what you did, what you stood up for, what you acted on. Did you try to make the world a better place? In order to do it, the world needs fusion. I just happen to think that Z is the best way to get there. And we're going to have one serious pizza party around here if it is.' Jimmy Potter stands inside the Machine, glaring down into the half-million-gallon pool of water at the submerged refrigerator-sized capacitors where, he suspects, there may be a broken, bubbling gas switch. Potter, a Texan, is the keeper of the Beast, the man who oversees the whole shebang for today's shot. 'Are those bubbles down there?' he asks out loud, vexed. 'We already sent the divers in. I sure hope not.' If Potter is driven by perfection, then he is merely a reflection of the culture at Sandia National Laboratories. And if the quest for fusion is intensely competitive, Moonily quixotic, and at times downright nasty, then Sandia mirrors, among its myriad projects, many of those same contradictory characteristics. Top secret or otherwise, spread over the dusty 27-square-mile patch of Kirtland Airforce Base, the projects include the training of honeybees to detect land mines, the invention of a foam that kills anthrax, the making of a synthetic sludge, and the perfecting of various micromachines, some so small as to be undetectable by the human eye, which might be used to lock down nuclear weapons. Sandia is the home to Teraflops, the fastest computer in the world, as well as the birthplace of moly-99, a radioactive substance widely used in medical procedures. On the east of the base, behind three rows of concertina wire, is a cluster of foothills rumoured to be now-empty nuclear silos. They seem to stand as a reminder of how closely the isotopes of Thanatos and Eros can be held in the same idea, for it to be a real idea, a saving idea, both have to be there, threatening to undo us and remake us at once. To obliterate and immortalise. Potter couldn't care about all that. 'My job is to work with the personalities here,' he says, now pacing the high bay, twitching with pent-up energy. He slips behind a pig (a radiation shield), and checks a silver box that houses a cryogenic pump. He monitors the tech crew, confers with the lead scientist on the shot, keeps everything running on time. 'You've got your top of the Ivy League class,' he continues. 'You've got prima donnas with huge egos. And you've got technicians who at least graduated high school. Nobody can operate without the other. The first thing that happens with two strong personalities is clash. It's my job to go to one and bring him up and maybe bring the other one down and then bring them together.' Of course, there are days when everything feels charged with Shakespearean plots and counterplots, days when tension fills up around the Machine. All of it is caused by the Machine, which rarely exists, of course, in its aluminum-and-Rexolite grandeur, oblivious. There is head-butting between the young comers kicking with ideas and the upper echelon of Z veterans, who ultimately hold the power here. There are Iagos trying to ice someone else's idea in order to promote their own. (The lab rewards the best with bonuses.) 'I've become a lot more aggressive,' says Melissa Douglas, one of only three women among the 60 full-time scientists who work on Z. 'You have to really stand your ground. It was very hard for me to do that at first.' In four years on the project, she remembers her worst day as the one when she delivered a seminar and a colleague heckled her mercilessly. Why? Was she that stupid? Did her PhD in plasma physics and her postdoc at Los Alamos make her that inept? So she took her weakness, her insecurity, her lack, and shot it into the Machine, and it came back as power, 290 terawatts' worth. As have others. Marriage is shot in. Love is shot in. Innocence and experience and numbers are shot in, and come back as something almost holy. While many of these scientists consider themselves agnostic, they are quick to admit that they still find themselves in thrall to the unknown, to the force that pulses through the Machine. 'In a deep sense, I would say that my greatest satisfaction here comes from the act of creation,' says Jim Bailey. 'Because what we're trying to do is create knowledge that didn't exist before. Whether that brings us closer to God or not, I don't know. It brings us closer to an understanding of the universe, and if you want to think of God in those terms, then I suppose you could define it that way.' Melissa Douglas describes the charge of joy she gets from a perfect photograph of a Rayleigh-Taylor instability taken inside the vacuum chamber by a pinhole camera at the moment of the wire array's implosion. 'A beautiful picture!' she says, holding up a snapshot that looks more like a Rorschach test - kind of blobby with spikes and valleys. 'It sounds ridiculous, but when I first saw it I jumped and hopped around the room. Ecstatic. Just amazing. Being around this machine, you can't help but feel awe. The universe is mathematical and, you know, God is a mathematician.' And Jimmy Potter - Jimmy Potter is clearing the high bay as sirens sound for all personnel to vacate the Machine and retreat to the control room. Today's shot will attempt to find a way to bombard the wire array uniformly with electricity, so that each last kilovolt of energy can be accelerated into the Machine and come back as more. 'I mean, how do you explain all this to someone outside of this place?' he says, gesturing toward the Machine. 'We don't make a product that can be sold. You can't really see what's going on on in that vacuum chamber. I usually just tell people I work with X-rays. That we've got a big machine doing big things, and one day we're gonna change your life.' Dawn inside the Machine, and it's silent. The frogmen and the men in white and blue jumpsuits are arriving, shaking off their sleep, downing coffee. Jimmy Potter got the shot last night, downloaded the diagnostics, sent everyone home saying they'd take apart the Machine today, and then drove the half hour to his house, over the mesa and the beautiful landscape, to his wife and kids, trying to forget this place for a few hours. At 5.30am, he was back, rallying the crew, which now has sluggishly begun its work, drilling and hammering at the vacuum chamber. The people of Z admit there's a new inten sity, especially given the Machine's recent exponential gains. There's something to prove - and they need to prove it fast. Plans to win funds to build a cheaper, intermediary machine named ZX, one that will lead to X-1, are the stuff of new worry and hope. And, like life on the edge of any new frontier, there is still the possibility of danger. But there are dreamy days here as well. There are times when some Z scientists find it hard not to let there minds wander, to entertain versions of fusion-propelled rockets arcing the local solar systems, of fuel stations on the moon or Io or Pluto, wherever you can pick up a little lithium and water. And there are others who imagine it as the Peace and Love Machine, who've put their trust and idealism for the best possible world in Z. And to get Peace and Love from the Machine, they have to shoot in their souls, holding nothing back. Now the crane groans over its huge tracks above the Machine, preparing to lift off the 8,000lb crown of the vacuum chamber. Last evening, the Machine inhaled the sun, this room filled with lightning, and then everything exploded. Now, when the crown is unbolted, hitched to a hook, and lifted away by the crane, a group of men tentatively peer down into the Machine, goggle-eyed, perhaps expecting to find some traces of gold dust or, more absurdly, a pile of confetti - or, by some miracle of the universe, maybe a fully formed angel, sleeping with its white wings pleached and sooty, its legs twisted under its body, both comical and impossible. So the men look and look, down into the centre of Z, the womb of the Machine, for some message there sent back from the invisible world. But it is just a well of black space - plasma and atoms unable to hold the weight of their gaze, the chill of their wonder.",

Consider Radiant Light Film, developed by technology giant 3M.

'That means that one layer reflects back one section of light and only that section.' By carefully combining different membranes, engineers can create sheets that allow some designated parts of the light spectrum to pass through, but not others.

Far more serious uses of this microscopically sculpted film are being prepared. 'By fiddling with the thickness of different layers, by sheering off a few atoms here and there, we can create layers that block out infrared light, as opposed to visible light,' adds Hicks. 'As a result, we have been able to make glass and plastic that are perfectly clear to the human eye but which completely block out infrared light - ideal for fruit-industry glasshouses and car windows by keeping out infrared radiation that cause dangerous overheating.' </p> <p>What is intriguing about engineering objects to an accuracy of a billionth of a metre - a nanometre - is that it encompasses so many topics: from electronics to microbiology, from chemistry to medicine. As Professor Chris Wilkinson, convener of Glasgow University's world-ranking Nanoelectronics Research Centre, points out, developments in one area are taken up instantly, and exploited, by scientists in other fields. </p> <p>His nanotechnology centre - housed in a seemingly unremarkable 70s edifice of grey concrete slabs on Glasgow's Gilmorehill campus - is a temple to this fusion of talents. Biologists, electrical engineers, materials scientists and physicists compete to think up ideas of ever-decreasing magnitude. </p> <p>The results have been startling, as exemplified by one stunning scientific first: a device that can hold a single, living virus in one precise position for inspection, and later dissection. As a result, scientists can now study the structure and properties of the smallest of all living organisms. It is a stunning achievement given that a virus is a mere quarter of a millionth of a metre in diameter. A human hair is 300 times thicker. </p> <p>'A lot of scientists said it would be impossible to hold an individual virus in one fixed position,' says Wilkinson. 'They said the perpetual oscillation of molecules would prevent us from holding something that small.' </p> <p>The project is the handiwork of bio-engineer Dr Hwyel Morgan, who created a series of tiny electrodes, each spaced within a few hundred millionths of a metre from each other. He then passed samples of tobacco mosaic and herpes viruses across these electrodes. 'Viruses possess dielectric properties which means that they will move in an electric field in one direction,' says Morgan. 'By finely tuning the frequency of the electric field, and manipulating the salinity of the solution in which the viruses are suspended, you can control these viruses so that they move one at a time. You can isolate one and hold it in a particular position.' </p> <p>His success has provided medical researchers with a precise way of selecting viruses by type - by picking them, physically, one at a time from a mixed sample of microbes. That is striking enough - but what really intrigues is the fact that Morgan's breakthrough was achieved using the same technology that other institute scientists are exploiting to build anti-crash radar scanners for cars, devices that automatically decelerate cars if distracted drivers fail to spot when they are closing in on a vehicle ahead of them. </p> <p>'You cannot put big radar dishes on a car's bonnet,' points out Dr Ian Thayne. 'Such dishes can only be made a few inches in diameter. However, the laws of physics dictate such an instrument would have to run at frequencies far higher than current radar systems, and only devices made of incredibly small components can do that. The higher the transistor frequency, the tinier it has to be.' </p> <p>Until recently, such Lilliputian construction would have been impossible. However, the situation has been transformed with the development of machines that use beams of electrons to cut the masks and shapes for semi-conductor components, replacing previous laser-driven models. In the institute's basement, engineers have built a special fabrication plant which uses beams of electrons to build such devices in pristine, dirt-free conditions. </p> <p>Nevertheless, in this bizarre setting, scientists have created semi-conductor components with nanometre precision, opening the door both to the manufacture of machines to hold individual viruses and to the creation of radar systems for family cars. Nanotechnology is about thinking laterally, as is demonstrated in another example of intellectual cross-fertilisation - the IDEAS project (Integrated Diagnostics for Environmental Analytical Systems). This involves a collaboration between Glasgow and Edinburgh scientists in the design and construction of an aspirin-sized robot fitted with miniaturised electronic scanners. When swallowed, these pill-proportioned probes will migrate to a patient's stomach and intestines and transmit crucial medical data: details of acidity, temperature and pressure, and the presence of chemicals, giving rapid warning if he or she has a leaking ulcer or a broken blood vessel caused by a tumour. </p> <p>'We will be able to use this for all sorts of awkward locations, not just medical ones,' says Professor Alan Murray of Edinburgh University, joint leader of the project with Dr David Cumming of Glasgow University. 'It will be able to help vets as well as engi neers surveying.

In the foreseeable future, products will include new ceramics, detectors, and medical scanners. For example, scientists want to copy the incredibly strong, interlinked proteins that cover a virus like chain mail, a development that could lead to the manufacture of powerfully strong fabrics. Other concepts include the creation of steel constructed out of tiny individual nanocrystals, making it stronger and more flexible. </p> <p>Further down the line, scientists talk of constructing tiny, self-replicating machines that will build their own replacements from individual atoms, or of constructing micro-machines that will wander around our bodies, fixing damage, extending our lives, and maybe even keeping us looking young.

      "body": "<p>A grey Monday morning, Jeremy Paxman on the radio. Woke up dreaming that I was lying on a beach in California: now I know that I'm not. For 45 minutes, the discussion is a genteel digest of various books Paxman's guests have written. Then, abruptly, the mood darkens as the presenter introduces Professor Kevin Warwick of the Cybernetics Department at Reading University.</p> <p>His tone is terse as he describes how Warwick had an operation to insert a small remote sensor into his arm, which was then linked to his computer, and how next year he plans to have another implant connected to his central nervous system, potentially enabling the machine to interact with his body, to send and receive instructions as a kind of surrogate brain. Warwick's fellow guests discuss some of the alarming issues raised by his work, but Paxman seems thrown. He can't believe what he's hearing. 'Well,' he tells them at the end, 'you're all either credulous or I'm... I'm benighted somehow.'</p> <p>The toaster clangs off and I find myself smiling. A few months ago, this stuff sounded like science fiction to me, too.</p> <p>The Intel building looms inscrutable white in the perfect Silicon Valley sun, just off Highway 101 at Santa Clara, near San Jos\u00e9. Gathered around it is a leafy campus, through which a few of the 6,000 staff stride in short sleeves and skirts. It is pleasant, but almost freakishly undramatic in presentation and appearance; like the suburban, Stepford-wife sprawl of the Valley as a whole, in fact. It takes an effort to remember that decisions taken here will have a more profound effect on the shape of things to come than all but a few acts of government over the coming decades.</p> <p>I've driven down from San Francisco because I want to know if and when computers will become capable of intelligent thought, and in all the world, few people can be better equipped to tell me than Justin Rattner, the Intel director who heads its Microprocessor Research Laboratories. In a blue suit and matching tie, with wire specs, he is a jocular textbook image of the grown-up geek, and he self-evidently loves his job. In a featureless grey and white seminar room, we begin by discussing Moore's Law, the projection which has computer processing speeds doubling every 18 months and which he expects to hold good for the next 10 years at least, adding with a chortle that, 'given the way of these things, that's almost like saying we don't see any end to it.'</p> <p>Could the machines exhibit behaviour which we would recognise as intelligent? Could we build machines that were smarter than us?</p> <p>'There is no question that an extraordinary amount of computing power is required to do that. No one really knows how much. All of our past attempts have fallen well short. But you have to assume that, yes, the day is foreseeable when that would be possible.'</p> <p>Once, thoughts such as these would have been little more than something to kick around down at the wine bar, but that changed in April, when the US internet culture magazine Wired ran a long and detailed article called 'Why the Future Doesn't Need Us', by the co-founder and chief scientist of Sun Microsystems, Bill Joy. The sub-heading read: 'Our most powerful 21st-century technologies - robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotech - are threatening to make humans an endangered species.' Anyone who has spent much time on the internet, or hanging around geeks, is familiar with such shrill prophesies, but not from a man like Bill Joy, the billionaire co-author of the Java computer language, who recently co-chaired the Presidential Commission on the Future of IT Research and is reputed to be a profoundly sane, socially conscious man. Wired editor Katrina Heron had chosen him to write the article for these very reasons, and it made an immediate and lasting impact in the US.</p> <p>Taken on its own, Joy's thesis sounded a little alarmist, but plausible. Until recently, he observed, he had expected Moore's Law to hold only until 2010 or so. Yet, thanks to the unexpectedly rapid progress in molecular electronics, it has become clear that 'we should be able to meet or exceed the Moore's Law rate of progress for another 30 years.' By 2030, then, we may be able to mass-produce machines that are a million times more powerful than the personal computers of today. No one knows whether this could ever give rise to consciousness - many of our more intractable existential questions will be answered at this point - but it could certainly allow machines to process information and make decisions with a rapidity and efficiency way beyond our own capabilities. In combination with rapid advances in genetic engineering and nanotechnology, Joy concluded that 'enormous transformative power is being unleashed... these advances open up the possibility to completely redesign the world, for better or worse.'</p> <p>The tiny nanotechnological machines are already being built, but are not yet amenable to remote control. That breakthrough is now expected within 30 years. Of necessity, these devices would be under the direction of computers, which almost anyone could own. They would also, by definition, have the potential for self-replication and thus some form of independence. In Engines of Creation (\u00a37.99, Fourth Estate), Eric Drexler's seminal work on the nanotech revolution, the author detailed the many ways in which it would improve our lives, but he also identified what has come to be known as the 'grey goo problem' - millions of microscopic 'assemblers' running amok, either by accident or design, with enormous and unstoppable destructive force. And, in contrast to industrial, 20th-century technologies, the final, enabling steps in these new ones will not necessarily be the most problematic and ponderous. 'The breakthrough to wild self-replication in robotics, genetic engineering or nanotechnology could come suddenly, reprising the surprise we felt when we learned of the cloning of a mammal,' claimed Joy. He invoked the atomic bomb and the antibiotic-resistant superbugs which haunt modern medicine to remind us that our husbandry of new science has been imperfect before. He might have added BSE and, according to some theories, HIV.</p> <p>The threat being described still felt rather abstract and unreal. Then I went off and did some research of my own, at which point it became clear that Bill Joy was not the only techno boffin serving notice of big and impending change. There was Professor Rodney Brooks, director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT offering the thought that, a few generations hence, 'I don't think we're going to be the same species any more.' There was Freeman Dyson, a distinguished contributor to the Standard Theory of Quantum Electrodynamics, declaring that 'humanity looks to me like a magnificent beginning, but not the final word'; the equally distinguished inventor Ray Kurzweil giving us 'a 50 per cent chance of survival', before adding, archly. 'But then, I've always been accused of being an optimist'; and Hans Moravec, director of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania casually observing that 'the robots will eventually succeed us: humans clearly face extinction.'</p> <p>And there is the question of who is going to have access to these powerful forces. Christine Peterson, president of the pro-new technology Foresight Institute just up the road from Intel at Palo Alto, had bluntly told me that, 'any military establishment looks at this stuff and says, \"We need this now.\" There is a race going on, no question. There is also a commercial race.' So, wanting to know whether there were strong links between the private capitalists of Silicon Valley and the military establishment, I contacted Michael Geyer, a professor of Contemporary History at the University of Chicago, who has a particular interest in this area and has written on 'infowar' in the past. The simple answer, he said, is that we can't be sure.</p> <p>'Every large-scale 20th-century technology had a strong military component,' he began. 'There has been a general view that this is not true of the electronic revolution, but it's still an open question. What we can say is that there is a huge discussion going on about a complete re-making of the military body into a primarily electronic force by 2020. Billions of dollars have been spent on this, but it remains unclear how this relates to the multibillions of dollars flowing out of venture capital. We know the military is there, though the wired community in Silicon Valley, who are mostly suspicious of the State, have yet to acknowledge it. Precisely how much crossover there is remains to be seen.</p> <p>'In any case, the new technology changes the security agenda out of all recognition. Hardware is no longer the primary issue. For the first time, knowledge and ingenuity can be very destructive weapons. And you never know who's got those.'</p> <p>The things Geyer said reminded me of Justin Rattner's commendation of Intel's latest 'star wars' technology, and also of a conversation I'd had earlier with John Leslie, professor of Philosophy at Guelph University in Canada. A few years ago, Leslie published a book rejoicing in the title The End of the World: The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction (\u00a312.50, Routledge), which was favourably reviewed in this and other papers, but which I haven't been able to mention with a straight face up to now. In it, he maps the many possible routes to our destruction as a species, eventually rating our chances of extinction at a sporting 30 per cent. He sees global warming and biological warfare as more immediate causes for concern than superintelligent computers and/or grey goo. In any case, the danger from these areas may not be quite what it seems.</p> <p>'Two possible scenarios present themselves here,' he says. 'The first is that the machines take over against our wishes. That seems to me less likely than that they take over with our tacit or explicit blessing. My own view is that, if it were all true, and they were conscious, then fine - but if, as is likely, they weren't conscious in the full sense, then that would be a disaster.'</p> <p>The computers taking over with our blessing? It sound preposterous. Until you speak to Professor Hans Moravec of MIT, who will be waving a white hanky and cheering them on. When I catch him, he's been awake writing continuously for 24 hours. He sounds tired at first, but perks up at the prospect of having a pop at Bill Joy.</p> <p>'I mean, the thing that was notable about Bill Joy,' he offers cheerily, 'was that he actually accepted the possibility of these things. That was the big transition for him. And then he sort of... panicked - ha ha ha!'</p> <p>Can Moravec understand the rest of the world's dismay at his own lack of panic?</p> <p>'I have no reason to panic. I've accepted the possibility of intelligent, mobile machines for 40 years. I see it as a major transition in the nature of human life. For me, robots are extensions of humanity. Something I'm always pointing out is that we're 99.9 per cent cultural beings now: the information that's passed from generation to generation in our genome consists of a few billion bits, but there are trillions of bits in our libraries. And we would not be who we are if it wasn't for this cultural information. The robots are simply the point when that cultural information takes over from strict biology. Eventually they might develop in their own directions, but that's the normal situation for descendants. They have their own lives.'</p> <p>Quite apart from the presumed inevitability of the machine's dominance, Moravec sounds as though he's looking forward to replacement. 'Well, I think of it as the most mature and potentially full future that we could have. Everything else seems horrible, stagnant, limiting; probably fatal. If we were to stay just in our biological form, sooner or later some biological cataclysm would come along which we couldn't deal with. By combining with machines, going into this form, we at least have a chance. Intelligence now is a rare and unusual thing in the world. Only human beings have it, and they're actually quite... er... what's the word...?'</p> <p>Dumb?</p> <p>'Ha ha ha. Yeah, since there's no competition, we've never noticed how bad we are at what we do. And computers have already exploited that. They can already do the job of 10,000 clerks, which shows how badly clerks are fitted for the job they do. But we are suited for seeing and moving and so on. Machines can't do that yet as well as we do.'</p> <p>Will he venture a timescale for these prophecies?</p> <p>'I have four stages of robots, that resemble reptiles, mammals, primates and humans in terms of what they can do and I expect them to be about a decade apart. And we're not yet at the reptile stage. Things we can produce this decade will be like very small vertebrates in their complexity - like fish. In fact, we're only five years away from commercialisation, with the first robots that will be able to clean floors or guard an area without requiring specialist installation. Machines which can learn in any meaningful sense are still a decade off, though.'</p> <p>Does he have no qualms about working on things that, in his own estimation, could one day subjugate or exterminate his own species?</p> <p>'Well, yeah, but I've decided that that's inevitable and that it's no different from your children deciding that they don't need you. So I think that we should just gracefully... bow out - ha ha ha. But I think we can have a pretty stable, self-policing system that supports us, though there would probably be some machines which were outside the system, which became wild. I think we can co-exist comfortably and live in some style for a while at least.'</p> <p>And I find myself thinking that Professor Moravec should get out more. Yet, at the same time, two projects currently being developed in university labs imply that his pronouncements are more than just self-serving hyperbole. First, two researchers at Brandeis University in Massachusetts have created a computerised system that automatically creates, evolves, improves and finally builds a variety of simple mobile creatures without significant human intervention. Then there is the aforementioned Professor Warwick at Reading, who hopes that his next implant will allow his computer to record motor signals as they pass through his central nervous system, then recreate the corresponding movement by replaying that recording. There is the additional and infinitely more intriguing possibility that this could work for subjective states involving emotions, memories, pain. Like Moravec, he expects computer intelligence to eclipse human intelligence some time in the next 20 to 30 years, but in contrast to the American, he professes to be worried by the prospect. He sees a possible solution - in fact, the only palatable solution - in augmenting our given, biological selves with computer technology. In joining them, as it were.</p> <p>'If anything, Moore's Law is speeding up, with processing speeds doubling every year or so now,' he explains. 'We know that machines will have phenomenal memory and speed of processing, so I say, \"Why can't I have a bit of that?\" Machines aren't limited to three dimensions the way we are. I'd love to be able to think in 20 dimensions.'</p> <p>As significant as any potential improvement on our flesh and blood inheritance, however, is the sensation Warwick got from being linked to his computer during the first experiment. 'One of the reactions I had to having the implant was a feeling of affinity with my computer. Once that becomes a permanent state, you're not really a human any more, you're a cyborg. Your values and ethics would be bound to change, I think, and you would view unaugmented humans a little differently.'</p> <p>Consider the attitude we have to cows, he adds. Once we were the same, but whereas we might like them now, we wouldn't necessarily elect one as prime minister (an assertion which, in the interest of decorum, we will allow to pass without further comment).</p> <p>'It's a dangerous game,' he concedes, 'because we're working with things that could change the world, and you can never be quite sure where that might lead. But that's the story of humanity, isn't it?'</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, this set of circumstances supports a healthy fringe of cultish pseudo-philosophies, with names like Transhumanism and Extropianism, which welcome the prospect of biological and neurological augmentation. They also await the coming of 'singularity', or the 'techno rapture', which is expected to happen when the super-intelligent computers we create acquire the capacity to design their successors, at which stage, it is believed, the cycles of Moore's Law will move from human to machine timescales. Given that computers don't eat or sleep and will have the capacity to think progressively more quickly than us, the cycles of invention, while remaining constant in relative terms, would get shorter and shorter in our subjective human terms, until finally they were racing into infinity, leaving us trailing in their wake, as a no doubt rather grumpy and confused rump of 'posthumanity'.</p> <p>Personally, I love this idea. It'd be like living the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey . But it's obviously bunk. Right?</p> <p>Ian Pearson is one of BT's 'futurologists' whom the company hires out to other organisations on a consultancy basis. He tells me that BT Labs has been saying everything you've just read for years and that, while it is easy to dismiss someone like Kevin Warwick as an attention-seeking nutter, what he says is valid: namely, 'that if you start building machines that have the potential to be smarter than people, you're playing a very, very dangerous game.'</p> <p>Going back to something that Jeremy Paxman said on the radio, though - couldn't we reassert our corporeal authority by simply switching the buggers off?</p> <p>'Perhaps,' he says. 'But imagine machines which make use of solar energy and/or are linked to a grid, with battery backup. Ten years after they've reached human equivalence, we can expect the computers to be millions of times smarter than us, with an infinitely more subtle grasp of physics and responses which, in the context of our slow biological brains, would seem instantaneous. If they were hostile, it would be like us fighting chimps.</p> <p>'A few years ago, we realised that we weren't far away from having a global telephone network with as many connections as the human brain. We've passed that now. BT tried to explore whether there was any danger of consciousness occurring, but had to give up, because we don't know what makes a thing conscious. Myself, I think we'll muddle through. The biggest fear for me is a big fundamentalist, anti-IT backlash. At some point, governments are going to have to wake up to these possibilities and start planning. I hope they do.'</p> <p>Do we believe any of this? Soft and inadequate-brained as I am, serious concern seemed easier in Silicon Valley, where virtually everyone you meet works in computer-related industries, talks about little else and can easily have you wondering whether the cyborgs aren't already among us. Even there, scepticism is easy to find, though. Confronted with his lead role in our future extinction, Intel's Justin Rattner took a sanguine line.</p> <p>'Well, you know,' he chuckled, 'those of us who were around in the 50s remember all the visions of what life was going to be like in the year 2000, with flying cars and tourist rockets to the moon. Technology just doesn't advance in this nice, linear fashion. And society represents tremendous back pressure on these things.'</p> <p>So he thought Bill Joy was fretting over nothing?</p> <p>'I think... that he must have seen The Matrix too many times.'</p> <p>And with that, he was up and off.

      "bodyText": "A grey Monday morning, Jeremy Paxman on the radio. Woke up dreaming that I was lying on a beach in California: now I know that I'm not. For 45 minutes, the discussion is a genteel digest of various books Paxman's guests have written. Then, abruptly, the mood darkens as the presenter introduces Professor Kevin Warwick of the Cybernetics Department at Reading University. His tone is terse as he describes how Warwick had an operation to insert a small remote sensor into his arm, which was then linked to his computer, and how next year he plans to have another implant connected to his central nervous system, potentially enabling the machine to interact with his body, to send and receive instructions as a kind of surrogate brain. Warwick's fellow guests discuss some of the alarming issues raised by his work, but Paxman seems thrown. He can't believe what he's hearing. 'Well,' he tells them at the end, 'you're all either credulous or I'm... I'm benighted somehow.' The toaster clangs off and I find myself smiling. A few months ago, this stuff sounded like science fiction to me, too. The Intel building looms inscrutable white in the perfect Silicon Valley sun, just off Highway 101 at Santa Clara, near San Jos\u00e9. Gathered around it is a leafy campus, through which a few of the 6,000 staff stride in short sleeves and skirts. It is pleasant, but almost freakishly undramatic in presentation and appearance; like the suburban, Stepford-wife sprawl of the Valley as a whole, in fact. It takes an effort to remember that decisions taken here will have a more profound effect on the shape of things to come than all but a few acts of government over the coming decades. I've driven down from San Francisco because I want to know if and when computers will become capable of intelligent thought, and in all the world, few people can be better equipped to tell me than Justin Rattner, the Intel director who heads its Microprocessor Research Laboratories. In a blue suit and matching tie, with wire specs, he is a jocular textbook image of the grown-up geek, and he self-evidently loves his job. In a featureless grey and white seminar room, we begin by discussing Moore's Law, the projection which has computer processing speeds doubling every 18 months and which he expects to hold good for the next 10 years at least, adding with a chortle that, 'given the way of these things, that's almost like saying we don't see any end to it.' Could the machines exhibit behaviour which we would recognise as intelligent? Could we build machines that were smarter than us? 'There is no question that an extraordinary amount of computing power is required to do that. No one really knows how much. All of our past attempts have fallen well short. But you have to assume that, yes, the day is foreseeable when that would be possible.' Once, thoughts such as these would have been little more than something to kick around down at the wine bar, but that changed in April, when the US internet culture magazine Wired ran a long and detailed article called 'Why the Future Doesn't Need Us', by the co-founder and chief scientist of Sun Microsystems, Bill Joy. The sub-heading read: 'Our most powerful 21st-century technologies - robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotech - are threatening to make humans an endangered species.' Anyone who has spent much time on the internet, or hanging around geeks, is familiar with such shrill prophesies, but not from a man like Bill Joy, the billionaire co-author of the Java computer language, who recently co-chaired the Presidential Commission on the Future of IT Research and is reputed to be a profoundly sane, socially conscious man. Wired editor Katrina Heron had chosen him to write the article for these very reasons, and it made an immediate and lasting impact in the US. Taken on its own, Joy's thesis sounded a little alarmist, but plausible. Until recently, he observed, he had expected Moore's Law to hold only until 2010 or so. Yet, thanks to the unexpectedly rapid progress in molecular electronics, it has become clear that 'we should be able to meet or exceed the Moore's Law rate of progress for another 30 years.' By 2030, then, we may be able to mass-produce machines that are a million times more powerful than the personal computers of today. No one knows whether this could ever give rise to consciousness - many of our more intractable existential questions will be answered at this point - but it could certainly allow machines to process information and make decisions with a rapidity and efficiency way beyond our own capabilities. In combination with rapid advances in genetic engineering and nanotechnology, Joy concluded that 'enormous transformative power is being unleashed... these advances open up the possibility to completely redesign the world, for better or worse.' The tiny nanotechnological machines are already being built, but are not yet amenable to remote control. That breakthrough is now expected within 30 years. Of necessity, these devices would be under the direction of computers, which almost anyone could own. They would also, by definition, have the potential for self-replication and thus some form of independence. In Engines of Creation (\u00a37.99, Fourth Estate), Eric Drexler's seminal work on the nanotech revolution, the author detailed the many ways in which it would improve our lives, but he also identified what has come to be known as the 'grey goo problem' - millions of microscopic 'assemblers' running amok, either by accident or design, with enormous and unstoppable destructive force. And, in contrast to industrial, 20th-century technologies, the final, enabling steps in these new ones will not necessarily be the most problematic and ponderous. 'The breakthrough to wild self-replication in robotics, genetic engineering or nanotechnology could come suddenly, reprising the surprise we felt when we learned of the cloning of a mammal,' claimed Joy. He invoked the atomic bomb and the antibiotic-resistant superbugs which haunt modern medicine to remind us that our husbandry of new science has been imperfect before. He might have added BSE and, according to some theories, HIV. The threat being described still felt rather abstract and unreal. Then I went off and did some research of my own, at which point it became clear that Bill Joy was not the only techno boffin serving notice of big and impending change. There was Professor Rodney Brooks, director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT offering the thought that, a few generations hence, 'I don't think we're going to be the same species any more.' There was Freeman Dyson, a distinguished contributor to the Standard Theory of Quantum Electrodynamics, declaring that 'humanity looks to me like a magnificent beginning, but not the final word'; the equally distinguished inventor Ray Kurzweil giving us 'a 50 per cent chance of survival', before adding, archly. 'But then, I've always been accused of being an optimist'; and Hans Moravec, director of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania casually observing that 'the robots will eventually succeed us: humans clearly face extinction.' And there is the question of who is going to have access to these powerful forces. Christine Peterson, president of the pro-new technology Foresight Institute just up the road from Intel at Palo Alto, had bluntly told me that, 'any military establishment looks at this stuff and says, \"We need this now.\" There is a race going on, no question. There is also a commercial race.' So, wanting to know whether there were strong links between the private capitalists of Silicon Valley and the military establishment, I contacted Michael Geyer, a professor of Contemporary History at the University of Chicago, who has a particular interest in this area and has written on 'infowar' in the past. The simple answer, he said, is that we can't be sure. 'Every large-scale 20th-century technology had a strong military component,' he began. 'There has been a general view that this is not true of the electronic revolution, but it's still an open question. What we can say is that there is a huge discussion going on about a complete re-making of the military body into a primarily electronic force by 2020. Billions of dollars have been spent on this, but it remains unclear how this relates to the multibillions of dollars flowing out of venture capital. We know the military is there, though the wired community in Silicon Valley, who are mostly suspicious of the State, have yet to acknowledge it. Precisely how much crossover there is remains to be seen. 'In any case, the new technology changes the security agenda out of all recognition. Hardware is no longer the primary issue. For the first time, knowledge and ingenuity can be very destructive weapons. And you never know who's got those.' The things Geyer said reminded me of Justin Rattner's commendation of Intel's latest 'star wars' technology, and also of a conversation I'd had earlier with John Leslie, professor of Philosophy at Guelph University in Canada. A few years ago, Leslie published a book rejoicing in the title The End of the World: The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction (\u00a312.50, Routledge), which was favourably reviewed in this and other papers, but which I haven't been able to mention with a straight face up to now. In it, he maps the many possible routes to our destruction as a species, eventually rating our chances of extinction at a sporting 30 per cent. He sees global warming and biological warfare as more immediate causes for concern than superintelligent computers and/or grey goo. In any case, the danger from these areas may not be quite what it seems. 'Two possible scenarios present themselves here,' he says. 'The first is that the machines take over against our wishes. That seems to me less likely than that they take over with our tacit or explicit blessing. My own view is that, if it were all true, and they were conscious, then fine - but if, as is likely, they weren't conscious in the full sense, then that would be a disaster.' The computers taking over with our blessing? It sound preposterous. Until you speak to Professor Hans Moravec of MIT, who will be waving a white hanky and cheering them on. When I catch him, he's been awake writing continuously for 24 hours. He sounds tired at first, but perks up at the prospect of having a pop at Bill Joy. 'I mean, the thing that was notable about Bill Joy,' he offers cheerily, 'was that he actually accepted the possibility of these things. That was the big transition for him. And then he sort of... panicked - ha ha ha!' Can Moravec understand the rest of the world's dismay at his own lack of panic? 'I have no reason to panic. I've accepted the possibility of intelligent, mobile machines for 40 years. I see it as a major transition in the nature of human life. For me, robots are extensions of humanity. Something I'm always pointing out is that we're 99.9 per cent cultural beings now: the information that's passed from generation to generation in our genome consists of a few billion bits, but there are trillions of bits in our libraries. And we would not be who we are if it wasn't for this cultural information. The robots are simply the point when that cultural information takes over from strict biology. Eventually they might develop in their own directions, but that's the normal situation for descendants. They have their own lives.' Quite apart from the presumed inevitability of the machine's dominance, Moravec sounds as though he's looking forward to replacement. 'Well, I think of it as the most mature and potentially full future that we could have. Everything else seems horrible, stagnant, limiting; probably fatal. If we were to stay just in our biological form, sooner or later some biological cataclysm would come along which we couldn't deal with. By combining with machines, going into this form, we at least have a chance. Intelligence now is a rare and unusual thing in the world. Only human beings have it, and they're actually quite... er... what's the word...?' Dumb? 'Ha ha ha. Yeah, since there's no competition, we've never noticed how bad we are at what we do. And computers have already exploited that. They can already do the job of 10,000 clerks, which shows how badly clerks are fitted for the job they do. But we are suited for seeing and moving and so on. Machines can't do that yet as well as we do.' Will he venture a timescale for these prophecies? 'I have four stages of robots, that resemble reptiles, mammals, primates and humans in terms of what they can do and I expect them to be about a decade apart. And we're not yet at the reptile stage. Things we can produce this decade will be like very small vertebrates in their complexity - like fish. In fact, we're only five years away from commercialisation, with the first robots that will be able to clean floors or guard an area without requiring specialist installation. Machines which can learn in any meaningful sense are still a decade off, though.' Does he have no qualms about working on things that, in his own estimation, could one day subjugate or exterminate his own species? 'Well, yeah, but I've decided that that's inevitable and that it's no different from your children deciding that they don't need you. So I think that we should just gracefully... bow out - ha ha ha. But I think we can have a pretty stable, self-policing system that supports us, though there would probably be some machines which were outside the system, which became wild. I think we can co-exist comfortably and live in some style for a while at least.' And I find myself thinking that Professor Moravec should get out more. Yet, at the same time, two projects currently being developed in university labs imply that his pronouncements are more than just self-serving hyperbole. First, two researchers at Brandeis University in Massachusetts have created a computerised system that automatically creates, evolves, improves and finally builds a variety of simple mobile creatures without significant human intervention. Then there is the aforementioned Professor Warwick at Reading, who hopes that his next implant will allow his computer to record motor signals as they pass through his central nervous system, then recreate the corresponding movement by replaying that recording. There is the additional and infinitely more intriguing possibility that this could work for subjective states involving emotions, memories, pain. Like Moravec, he expects computer intelligence to eclipse human intelligence some time in the next 20 to 30 years, but in contrast to the American, he professes to be worried by the prospect. He sees a possible solution - in fact, the only palatable solution - in augmenting our given, biological selves with computer technology. In joining them, as it were. 'If anything, Moore's Law is speeding up, with processing speeds doubling every year or so now,' he explains. 'We know that machines will have phenomenal memory and speed of processing, so I say, \"Why can't I have a bit of that?\" Machines aren't limited to three dimensions the way we are. I'd love to be able to think in 20 dimensions.' As significant as any potential improvement on our flesh and blood inheritance, however, is the sensation Warwick got from being linked to his computer during the first experiment. 'One of the reactions I had to having the implant was a feeling of affinity with my computer. Once that becomes a permanent state, you're not really a human any more, you're a cyborg. Your values and ethics would be bound to change, I think, and you would view unaugmented humans a little differently.' Consider the attitude we have to cows, he adds. Once we were the same, but whereas we might like them now, we wouldn't necessarily elect one as prime minister (an assertion which, in the interest of decorum, we will allow to pass without further comment). 'It's a dangerous game,' he concedes, 'because we're working with things that could change the world, and you can never be quite sure where that might lead. But that's the story of humanity, isn't it?' Unsurprisingly, this set of circumstances supports a healthy fringe of cultish pseudo-philosophies, with names like Transhumanism and Extropianism, which welcome the prospect of biological and neurological augmentation.

It stemmed from the Post Office's work on the Prestel system and states, in archetypal deathless prose, how 'Information for display at a terminal apparatus of a computer is stored in blocks the first part of which contains the information which is actually displayed at the terminal and the second part of which contains information relating to the display and which may be used to influence the display at the time or in response to a keyboard entry signal'.

It is clearly described, for example, in Vannevar Bush's celebrated article As We May Think, published in the Atlantic Monthly in July 1945. The idea of what Bush called 'associative linking' was then taken up by Ted Nelson - the man who coined the term 'hypertext', in 1965 - and implemented by Douglas Engel bart in a document-handling system he built at Stanford Research Institute in the mid-1960s. In September 1968, at the Joint Fall Computer Conference in San Francisco, Engelbart gave a live demonstration of his system which by that stage included bit-mapped screens, resizeable windows, the use of a mouse - and dynamic hyperlinking between documents. </p> <p>Engelbart's demo made an indelible impression on all who saw it. It changed history because it influenced the people who staffed Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center and invented most of the computing technology we use today. A film was made of the demo, but prints of it have for years been more elusive than the Dead Sea Scrolls. </p> <p>Until now. Some genius at Stanford University has located a copy, digitised it, and is streaming it across the net. (See footnotes link for the URL.) It provides incontrovertible evidence of the 'prior art' which invalidates BT's preposterous claim. </p> <p>'What are these BT guys on?' inquired a Californian friend in an email recently. </p> <p>'Haven't a clue,' I replied, truthfully.

But it is unlikely to wash with any judge who knows the first thing about the net. The fact is that hyperlinking was old hat long before BT existed. It is clearly described, for example, in Vannevar Bush's celebrated article As We May Think, published in the Atlantic Monthly in July 1945. The idea of what Bush called 'associative linking' was then taken up by Ted Nelson - the man who coined the term 'hypertext', in 1965 - and implemented by Douglas Engel bart in a document-handling system he built at Stanford Research Institute in the mid-1960s. In September 1968, at the Joint Fall Computer Conference in San Francisco, Engelbart gave a live demonstration of his system which by that stage included bit-mapped screens, resizeable windows, the use of a mouse - and dynamic hyperlinking between documents. Engelbart's demo made an indelible impression on all who saw it. It changed history because it influenced the people who staffed Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center and invented most of the computing technology we use today. A film was made of the demo, but prints of it have for years been more elusive than the Dead Sea Scrolls. Until now. Some genius at Stanford University has located a copy, digitised it, and is streaming it across the net. (See footnotes link for the URL.) It provides incontrovertible evidence of the 'prior art' which invalidates BT's preposterous claim. 'What are these BT guys on?' inquired a Californian friend in an email recently. 'Haven't a clue,' I replied, truthfully. Just like BT, in fact. John.Naughton@observer.co.uk www.briefhistory.com/footnotes/",

Reports charting the decline of manufacturing groups from Ford - which ended vehicle production at Dagenham - and tyre makers Dunlop and Goodyear to shipyard Harland &amp; Woolf, and textile company Coats Viyella provided dismal reading for workers, unions and Ministers alike. </p> <p>The year even ended on a depressing note, with the proposed closure of Vauxhall's Luton plant placing the axe over 2,000 employees. </p> <p>There were some notable exceptions. In line with accepted wisdom, companies that produce higher-value products - electronic and optical goods, for example - recorded good growth. </p> <p>Stephen Byers, the Trade Secretary, has attempted to maintain a laissez faire approach, insisting that industrial 'restructuring' is a matter for companies not gov ernments and heralding the end of state handouts, while trumpeting packages of targeted aid to project Labour as a government that cares about manufacturing. </p> <p>He had already injected \u00a3100 million into coal, and \u00a3530m of launch aid into BAe systems for the Airbus superjumbo in the spring and summer. </p> <p>As Christmas approached he was able to offer respite to the 1,000 workers at Cammell Laird in Birkenhead - with an aid package to help secure orders for cruise liners - and to boost oil workers with \u00a31billion of investment in the North Sea, while the EU cleared an aid package for car maker Nissan, helping secure jobs at its Sunderland plant. </p> <p>But this was by no means a recovery. </p> <p>Latest official statistics covering the year to September chart a dismal year. While manufacturing as a whole grew sluggishly - by about 1.3 per cent - the traditional manufacturing sectors contracted: textiles by 4.1 per cent, metals by 2 per cent, food, drink and tobaccos by 1.5 per cent, paper and printing by 1 per cent. </p> <p>The contrast between these and electrical and optical engineering - which grew by 15 per cent - was striking. Perhaps even more striking was the difference between this soaraway engineering sub-sector, and the other two components of the official engineering figures, machinery and equipment - down 0.2 per cent - and transport, motors and the motor trade - down a staggering 7 per cent. </p> <p>These negatives were reflected in the job-loss tally. Textiles saw 25,000 employees go, transport equipment, 23,000, manufacturing equipment 11,400, and metals 8,100. </p> <p>It is a year Byers, in particular, will want to forget, and will not want to see repeated, particularly in the sensitive months leading up to a possible spring election. </p> <p>He received some comfort on this score from Chancellor Gordon Brown, who revealed in his Pre-Budget Report in November a forecast of 2 per cent growth in manufacturing for 2001. </p> <p>So what will 2001 hold? </p> <p>The headlines are likely to provide a grisly start to the year. Corus is planning a further 6,000 job cuts and is expected to close its Llanwern and Teesside works. </p> <p>The wider picture is similarly unpromising - although interest rates are expected to fall by half of one per cent by the middle of next year. </p> <p>Kate Barker, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry, says: 'The most likely outcome for manufacturing next year is largely the same as this year - sluggish growth, and unpromising investment.' </p> <p>Her view is shared by Ian Brinkley of the Trades Union Congress: 'It looks like we are in for another year of quite substantial job losses. I can't see any recovery coming through in the output figures, and the Treasury forecasts saying manufacturing will grow by 2 per cent look untenable. I think 0.8 to 0.9 per cent looks more likely.' </p> <p>The key factor next year will be the shift in the global economy - driven, most economists agree, by a US slowdown, which President-elect George W Bush has been so conspicuous in highlighting. </p> <p>US growth - at 5 per cent and still fuelled by technology companies - was influen tial on the pattern of last year's UK manufacturing performance. Those companies that did well were not only higher-value producers, but also companies which sold high volumes to US markets. </p> <p>However, a spate of bad corporate news, not only from new-economy stars such as Intel and Microsoft, but also from old-economy industrial stocks such as Gillette, combined with slackening consumer demand and credit tightening, has led the Federal Reserve to transform from hawkish to doveish on interest rates. Economists predict US growth falling to around 2 per cent next year. </p> <p>A slowdown in the US, followed by similar performances elsewhere, would alter the pattern of trading for exporting manufacturers. </p> <p>While the overall effect on UK growth is likely to be minimal - exports to the US account for only 4 per cent of GDP - it will impact directly on some UK sectors. And a US slowdown could feed into Europe, where exports account for some 15 per cent of GDP. </p> <p>Barker says: 'If the dollar is down against the euro, sterling will fall, too. The key question is whether that will relieve the pressure on manufacturing, which is likely to face difficulties from the slowdown in the US. </p> <p>'I'm not sure that this will mean a better year, rather, the pain is likely to be shifted from those who have suffered this year, and who may benefit from a lower sterling exchange rate, to those who have traded off strong growth in the US.' </p> <p>Beleaguered companies such as Corus, Rover and the textiles manufacturers, who trade with thin margins in highly competitive markets, with costs in high sterling and revenues in weak euros, would benefit. </p> <p>Stephen Radley of the Engineering Employers Federation expects the growth pattern to shift among engineering firms - which this year grew by an average of 3.2 per cent compared with manufacturing's overall 1.3 per cent. </p> <p>As a result of US-inspired currency fluctuations, he expects a halving in growth among electronics companies; while in mechanical engineering, motor and electrical, he expects a rebound. </p> <p>For the unions, however, the Government needs to be more active to persuade voters that it is taking manufacturing seriously. Brinkley says Britain lags behind the rest of Europe in the amount of aid it channels industry's way - between 1996 and 1998 the UK paid 334 euros per worker, compared with 1,434 in Germany, 1,131 in France and 1,955 in Italy. </p> <p>Given that this year's good news - Airbus, Cammell Laird, North Sea oil, Nissan - has come in the wake of targeted subsidies, he may have a point. </p> <p>Byers will give us his thoughts in a White Paper, expected before the election.

      "body": "<p><strong> Unbreakable </strong> (118 mins, 12) Directed by M. Night Shyamalan; starring Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Robin Wright Penn </p> <p><strong> Blackboards </strong> (85 mins, PG) Directed by Samira Makhmalbaf; starring Said Mohamadi, Behnaz Jafari, Bahman Ghobadi </p> <p>The year ends with a bang not a whimper, or rather with a pair of decisive bangs in the form of pictures by two confident young directors who first emerged in the late Nineties. Both are of Asian extraction and discovered a cinematic vocation early in life, learning to make films at the same time as they learnt to read books. Though superficially very different, they are visual stylists and movie fabulists. </p> <p>The 29-year-old M. Night Shayamalan was brought up in Philadelphia, the son of sub-continental Indian parents, both of them doctors. He started to make short movies at the age of 10 and decided at 17 that he wanted to become a professional filmmaker, attending film school in New York rather than studying medicine. </p> <p>The 20-year-old Samira Makhmalbaf appeared at the age of eight in The Cyclist, directed by her father, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, one of Iran's leading directors. She then studied film before becoming his assistant. Whether they'd have become more interesting cin\u00e9astes had they had a traditional academic education, we shall never know. </p> <p>Shayamalan's third film The Sixth Sense (its two low-budget predecessors made little impact and weren't released here) garnered six Oscar nominations and became the tenth most profitable film of all time. Makhmalbaf's first, The Apple, was shown in the Un Certain Regard section at Cannes in 1998 and played to world-wide acclaim on the festival and art house circuits. </p> <p>Like The Sixth Sense , Shayamalan's new film, Unbreakable, is an occult thriller, and it too is set in Philadelphia, and stars Bruce Willis as a traumatised victim of violence. In this case Willis plays David Dunn, a former college football star with a tottering marriage and an unrewarding job as security officer at a university sports stadium. He emerges unscathed as the sole survivor of a railway accident in which 131 people die. </p> <p>As David comes to terms with his miraculous delivery he's contacted by Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), the well-off African-American owner of a gallery dealing in original art works by comic book illustrators. Since birth, Elijah has suffered from a severe form of osteoporosis that results in constant fracturing of his bones, and he's in search of someone at the other end of the spectrum - someone like David who appears indestructible. Such a person, he believes, must have superhuman powers that could make him a hero comparable to those of ancient times, a type kept alive in purest form, so he argues, by comic books. </p> <p>The Old Testament names (Elijah the prophet who sought to purify society and predated the coming of the Messiah; David the heroic leader and man of destiny) hint at the underlying allegory. With some subtlety the director traces the increasing if uneasy involvement of the two men and how one makes the other aware of his predetermined role. As in The Sixth Sense the dark, lowering city provides a portentous setting for the story. Sometimes we're made to see events from the characters' point of view, as when we watch TV upside down through the eyes of David's hero-worshipping son looking at a newsreel of the train crash, or we observe a would-be assassin on a railway platform from the twisted perspective of Elijah after he's fallen down a flight of stairs and fractured several bones. More often, however, there are long takes in deep focus in which we overhear conversations at some distance, with bars, staircases, rows of restaurant tables, the seats of a railway carriage or open doors between the camera and the people we're listening to. </p> <p>A visual tour-de-force occurs when David becomes aware of his unusual powers at night on the railway station concourse. His mind takes in confusing information about the depredations of those he bumps into, and he has to decide whose victims are most worthy of his heroic attentions. Shyamalan, however, doesn't know how to resolve his picture. It ends abruptly, surprisingly and shockingly, and one leaves vaguely dissatisfied. But it's a film to see, to enjoy, and perhaps to ponder. </p> <p>Samira Makhmalbaf's Blackboards, which won the Special Jury Prize at Cannes this year, strikes into different territory from The Apple, her semi-documentary debut about two little girls in Tehran escaping the bondage of their parents. But the theme of tyrannical oppression and enforced ignorance is pursued in the oblique, coded style that a rigid society has forced on Iranian film makers and which has given their films such resonance. The setting is the arid, awesomely beautiful north-west of the country, where Kurds are being persecuted on either side of the borders between Iran, Iraq and Turkey. </p> <p>Offering hope and relief to the downtrodden of Kurdistan are itinerant schoolteachers, 10 of whom are first seen in the distance on a dusty mountain road, carrying blackboards on their backs and resembling the bird-like sculptures of Lynn Chadwick and Elisabeth Frink. They hide from a helicopter gunship, and then split to go in search of pupils. Like travelling holy men, they seek little in return for their simple, liberating lessons in reading, writing and arithmetic. The movie concentrates on two of them, Reeboir and Sa\u00efd. </p> <p>Reeboir attaches himself to a party of teenage smugglers who risk their lives carrying heavy contraband goods across the border for exploitative, conspicuously absent employers. Sa\u00efd joins a large group of old men attempting to make a pilgrimage over the mountains to the native lands from which they presumably fled during the recent war. The only young person with the old men, and the only woman in the film, is Halalheh, the widowed daughter of one the most decrepit of the men, and she's accompanied by her little child. No one in either camp sees any value in education, having adjusted themselves to a life of permanent exploitation and persecution that leaves them at the mercy of cruel, anonymous border guards. </p> <p>Nevertheless Reeboir and Sa\u00efd persist in a doggedly heroic manner, using their blackboards variously as protective camouflage, stretchers, clothes lines, screens for a wedding, doors for privacy, splints for broken limbs, shields against gunfire. So emblematic does his professional prop become that Sa\u00efd becomes known to the old men as Blackboard. </p> <p> Blackboards is plainly an allegory or parable, but it has a force and documentary vividness that resists simple explanations and deters us from reading easy messages into it. But ultimately, and unsentimentally, it's an affirmative work. Only the young woman and one of the teachers has any previous acting experience, but Makhmalbaf (whose father co-scripted the film as well as editing it) manages to bind the two groups of young and elderly non-professional actors into distinct communities on the move. </p> <p>Jason Robards Jr, who died last week aged 78, came late to acting and much later to the cinema, though he was the son of a well-known screen and stage performer and was educated at Hollywood High School. As a stage actor he was the greatest exponent of Eugene O'Neill (another theatrical son much drawn to the bottle), and one of my great regrets is that I didn't see his Hickey in the 1956 revival of The Iceman Cometh, though I was lucky enough to catch his Cornelius Melody on Broadway in A Touch of the Poet, and we're all fortunate that he reprised his Jamie Tyrone in Sidney Lumet's 1961 film of A Long Day's Journey into Night. The latter was only Robards' fourth movie, made when he was 40, but he went on to appear in a further 50 pictures, several of them classics, culminating in his final appearance as the dying patriarch in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia last year. </p> <p>That gravelly voice lent authority to the soundtrack of documentaries, and he was memorable in parts as different as the honest bandit in Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West and the exasperated cop chasing Bill Murray in Quick Change. But the finest roles to which he lent that craggy, crooked, infinitely experienced face were real-life figures, some good, some bad, but all in the American grain - Doc Holliday (Hour of the Gun), Al Capone (The St Valentine's Day Massacre), General Lew Wallace (Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid), Richard Nixon (TV's Washington: Behind Closed Doors), Ben Bradlee (All the President's Men), Dashiell Hammett (Julia), Howard Hughes (Melvin and Howard). This was a veritable Mount Rushmore of a movie career.</p>",

      "body": "<p>'I am not a very good actor,' says David Baddiel, who stars in Baddiel's Syndrome, a new sitcom, 'but there has been a tradition in America of taking people who have got successful stand-up personas and just giving them legs - putting them in dramatic and narrative situations. Seinfeld, Roseanne, Bob Newhart, Bill Cosby. That hasn't happened much in this country, rather oddly.' </p> <p>But now it has happened. In Baddiel's Syndrome, David Baddiel plays David Baddiel, an architect in therapy who suspects he is Jewish. The first thing that strikes you about this sitcom, which Baddiel has written with journalist Pete Bradshaw, is that it doesn't look like a British sitcom. It looks like an American sitcom which happens to be set in Camden Town. It's about middle-class people in their thirties, mostly idiots, who sit around talking rubbish. They muse about the nature of pistachio nuts, or pipe-smoking, or whether it's possible to sing a karaoke version of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells. The punch lines, crafted by a team of writers, as well as Baddiel and Bradshaw, come at you every few seconds. And just in case you hadn't made the connection, the scenes are linked with peppy, Friends -like guitar music. </p> <p>Baddiel and Bradshaw are sitting in Baddiel's large and elaborately furnished house in Belsize Park, north London. 'I think Friends is brilliant,' says Baddiel, 'and it was massively underrated in this country for a very British reason, which is the assumption that because the cast is beautiful, it must be vacuous. Whereas in fact, it's brilliantly, brilliantly written. I've seen episodes of Friends which are as funny as any sitcom I've ever seen.' </p> <p>Bradshaw, too, is excited by the American comedy model. 'It's more intensively farmed,' he says. 'I mean, take a British sitcom like Victoria Wood's Dinnerladies. I've got no problem with it; I think it's quite amusing. But it's very gentle, and it just lies there, and you just have to go up and cuddle it, basically. Whereas with American sitcoms like Friends or Seinfeld, every line has been crafted to punch or gouge out a laugh. Here, there's a kind of gentleman amateur school which sometimes creates wonderful things, and often creates rather watery and dull things which can go on forever, like Last of the Summer Wine which has always made me want to commit suicide.' </p> <p>In Baddiel's Syndrome, Bradshaw plays Lord Peter Harrington, a fey aristocrat who has been at a loose end since he lost his seat in the House of Lords. Morwenna Banks, Baddiel's real-life girlfriend, is Eva, a Slovenian cleaning lady; the American actor Demetri Goritsas plays an idiot savant along the lines of Woody Harrelson's barman in Cheers. It is a story of deluded and whimsical people being put in their place, often curtly and abrasively, by the Baddiel character, which he plays more or less as the persona he employed as a stand-up comedian, or alongside Frank Skinner in Fantasy Football. At the beginning and end of every episode, we see Baddiel on the couch, being analysed by the voice of Stephen Fry. </p> <p>'Artistically,' says Baddiel, 'this has been the hardest thing I've had to write. Harder than a novel, definitely. The physics of it is really difficult. You think you've got enough storylines. But they run out if you use three or four an episode.' He held auditions for writers, asking them to come up with ideas, and organised weekly sessions with a group that included Jonathan Ross and his wife Jane, and Jack Barth who has written for The Simpsons. </p> <p> Baddiel's Syndrome was commissioned by Sky, for an estimated \u00a35 million, which works out at about \u00a3250,000 an episode. Some reports wrongly suggested that the \u00a35m was Baddiel's personal fee. ITV had commissioned a pilot episode but thought it was, in Baddiel's words, 'too sophisticated'. He says: 'There's an episode which begins with two people going into a cubicle to take drugs, which some people would say is too alienating. But actually that's bollocks. Working-class people in Bradford are not going to say, \"What's going on?\" One of the things that people in TV seem very frightened of is this sense of, \"Oh, but you'll alienate them because you're talking about something they might not know about.\" I think the people that don't know about this stuff don't really exist.' </p> <p>Elisabeth Murdoch at Sky was keen to buy the series. Baddiel recalls: 'She had this big visionary idea that Sky was going to turn into HBO, and would do really quality programming. I remember her saying, \"I want to get away from the idea of dishes on council homes and Rupert Murdoch\".' </p> <p>Like his character, Baddiel has been in therapy, but he doesn't like to talk about it - he thinks comedians trade too readily on their depression. 'When they play the depressed card,' he says, 'they're really saying, \"I'm a genius\".' He grew up in the suburbs north of London; his father collected Dinky toys and his mother was a hoarder of golf memorabilia. His house, he says, was 'wall to wall covered in either toys or pictures of toys, or golf memorabilia, or golfing scenes, in a mental, mental way.' </p> <p>Bradshaw, the son of a retired photographer, has never been in therapy. 'I'm terribly frightened of what I might find out about myself,' he says. He first met Baddiel in 1979, at Haberdasher's school in Elstree, at a school election. The earnest Baddiel stood as the Socialist candidate; Bradshaw was a Satanist. 'He won,' says Baddiel, 'and I got about four votes.' Later, they performed together with the Cambridge Footlights. </p> <p>Bradshaw is a revelation in the show; he is a natural clown. His character is always trying, and failing, to find a purpose in life. In one episode he grows a moustache, believing that this might be the answer, and finds himself under siege because people think he's a pervert. Baddiel says: 'I forced him into situations that, in a way, he'd rather not confront.' Like Bradshaw, his character, Lord Peter, is blind in one eye; Baddiel wrote a storyline in which he injures his other eye. A lot of the humour is edgy. Baddiel puts in frequent references to the Holocaust, and one set-up requires you to laugh when a door is opened to reveal a room full of Ku Klux Klan members. </p> <p>Baddiel says: 'I remember watching an episode of Seinfeld in which George can't understand why security guards can't sit down. He gets obsessed with it and eventually buys a chair for a security guard who sits down and goes to sleep. The shop gets robbed. That's a brilliant extrapolation of what is essentially observational comedy. And that's where we've pitched the show.' </p> <p>'Also,' says Bradshaw, 'it's topped and tailed structurally in the same way that our show is topped and tailed.' 'Now you're making it sound too much like Seinfeld ,' says Baddiel. </p> <p><strong>Kathryn Flett: My life as a TV cow in Baddiel's sitcom</strong></p> <p>'Er, this is a bit of an unusual request...' said the voice on the phone, 'but we wondered if you might be interested in screen-testing for a part in Sky's new sitcom, Baddiel's Syndrome?'

I hadn't dared ask why I had been chosen to play the microscopically small, but frankly pivotal role of Martina Chatwin, though I had a big hunch: 'Martina' is a broadsheet hackette who writes a first-person confessional column, and given that I hadn't done that sort thing for, ooh, years, the Sunday Times 's Liz Jones must already have turned it down. Then there was the undeniably worrying fact that Martina was, in the words of David Baddiel's character (an angsty thirtysomething called David Baddiel): 'a cow'.</p> <p>I think it takes balls to say to someone, 'Would you like to play a complete cow whose character is, in fact, not terribly loosely based on you...', and so I should have the guts to prove that - ha!ha!ha! - I could laugh at myself, or at least the me they humorously perceived me to be, while also bringing something extra to Martina: a level of humanity and grace that was, admittedly, not altogether evident in the script. And all of this in roughly 90 seconds of airtime. Who wouldn't leap at that sort of challenge, given that there are so few good parts for journalists in their mid-thirties? Hey, Martina might be a cow, but she was a well-written cow.</p> <p>At Teddington Studios, I had a dressing-room with my name on the door and a horrible costume on a hanger. This came as no surprise because if Martina was going to be 'a cow' hidden inside the Versace-clad body of a love goddess, then they would have given the part to Liz Hurley. Indeed it is, I think, fair to say that I eventually emerged from hair and make-up looking like Olive from On The Buses. I enjoyed the whole experience very much but there was no escaping the fact that, even as my heart said, 'You are Uma Thurman', the TV monitor said, 'You are in panto in Wolverhampton playing the Ugly Sister's slightly uglier banjo-strumming cousin'.</p> <p>So, after several fraught months on a rigorous high-collagen/low-carb diet, last week I again summoned the courage to speak to Peter Bradshaw - Baddiel's Syndrome 's co-writer, co-star (and memorably, in episode six, Martina Chatwin's boyfriend), not to mention the Guardian's film critic, who once sensibly turned down a part in a production of Cyrano de Bergerac directed by some bloke called Sam Mendes but has finally got himself a proper acting break.</p> <p>After some polite obfuscation in response to my inquiry about the genesis of Martina's character ('well, obviously, it was based on your book and column...'), Bradshaw admitted that:'If we get recommissioned, you may have to clear your schedule.' Sweet! And if they allow Martina to wear the sort of frocks that reveal both her inner and outer beauty and then spin her off into a Frasier -style series of her own, Ms Chatwin and I might even think about it. In the meantime, however, I urge you to enjoy the series - an entirely unbiased review of which reads: 'I laughed out loud and corpsed twice!

      "bodyText": "'I am not a very good actor,' says David Baddiel, who stars in Baddiel's Syndrome, a new sitcom, 'but there has been a tradition in America of taking people who have got successful stand-up personas and just giving them legs - putting them in dramatic and narrative situations. Seinfeld, Roseanne, Bob Newhart, Bill Cosby. That hasn't happened much in this country, rather oddly.' But now it has happened. In Baddiel's Syndrome, David Baddiel plays David Baddiel, an architect in therapy who suspects he is Jewish. The first thing that strikes you about this sitcom, which Baddiel has written with journalist Pete Bradshaw, is that it doesn't look like a British sitcom. It looks like an American sitcom which happens to be set in Camden Town. It's about middle-class people in their thirties, mostly idiots, who sit around talking rubbish. They muse about the nature of pistachio nuts, or pipe-smoking, or whether it's possible to sing a karaoke version of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells. The punch lines, crafted by a team of writers, as well as Baddiel and Bradshaw, come at you every few seconds. And just in case you hadn't made the connection, the scenes are linked with peppy, Friends -like guitar music. Baddiel and Bradshaw are sitting in Baddiel's large and elaborately furnished house in Belsize Park, north London. 'I think Friends is brilliant,' says Baddiel, 'and it was massively underrated in this country for a very British reason, which is the assumption that because the cast is beautiful, it must be vacuous. Whereas in fact, it's brilliantly, brilliantly written. I've seen episodes of Friends which are as funny as any sitcom I've ever seen.' Bradshaw, too, is excited by the American comedy model. 'It's more intensively farmed,' he says. 'I mean, take a British sitcom like Victoria Wood's Dinnerladies. I've got no problem with it; I think it's quite amusing. But it's very gentle, and it just lies there, and you just have to go up and cuddle it, basically. Whereas with American sitcoms like Friends or Seinfeld, every line has been crafted to punch or gouge out a laugh. Here, there's a kind of gentleman amateur school which sometimes creates wonderful things, and often creates rather watery and dull things which can go on forever, like Last of the Summer Wine which has always made me want to commit suicide.' In Baddiel's Syndrome, Bradshaw plays Lord Peter Harrington, a fey aristocrat who has been at a loose end since he lost his seat in the House of Lords. Morwenna Banks, Baddiel's real-life girlfriend, is Eva, a Slovenian cleaning lady; the American actor Demetri Goritsas plays an idiot savant along the lines of Woody Harrelson's barman in Cheers. It is a story of deluded and whimsical people being put in their place, often curtly and abrasively, by the Baddiel character, which he plays more or less as the persona he employed as a stand-up comedian, or alongside Frank Skinner in Fantasy Football. At the beginning and end of every episode, we see Baddiel on the couch, being analysed by the voice of Stephen Fry. 'Artistically,' says Baddiel, 'this has been the hardest thing I've had to write. Harder than a novel, definitely. The physics of it is really difficult. You think you've got enough storylines. But they run out if you use three or four an episode.' He held auditions for writers, asking them to come up with ideas, and organised weekly sessions with a group that included Jonathan Ross and his wife Jane, and Jack Barth who has written for The Simpsons. Baddiel's Syndrome was commissioned by Sky, for an estimated \u00a35 million, which works out at about \u00a3250,000 an episode.

'Also,' says Bradshaw, 'it's topped and tailed structurally in the same way that our show is topped and tailed.' 'Now you're making it sound too much like Seinfeld ,' says Baddiel.

      "body": "<p><strong> The Royle Family </strong> BBC1 </p> <p><strong> Cold Feet </strong> ITV </p> <p><strong> The League of Gentlemen </strong> BBC2 </p> <p><strong> The Last Fast Show Ever </strong> BBC2 </p> <p><strong> The Sleeper </strong> BBC1 </p> <p><strong> Donovan Quick </strong> BBC1 </p> <p><strong> Life and Death and Damien Hirst </strong> C4 </p> <p>So, the Christmas ratings were dismal. Titanic floundered (though given that Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On' is, famously, the nation's most requested funeral dirge, maybe that came as no surprise to anybody outside the BBC), while The Royle Family just scraped into the top 10. It was a good episode, but perhaps the Royles reflect just a little too accurately the average blackly dysfunctional family Christmas to be classed as escapist entertainment. Indeed, this year a more ironically downbeat selection of seasonal offerings it would have been hard to assemble. Who could possibly have watched Charlotte Church, lip gloss a-quiver through 'Silent Night' during Sunday's Christmas in the Holy Land, without recognising that, outside, it was anything but. </p> <p>Even the final episode in the penultimate series of Cold Feet - which, to my mind, always vacillates uneasily between toe-curling sentimentality and faux-grittiness - decided it couldn't face a wedding without invoking, for our light comedic delectation, domestic violence, infertility, adultery, divorce and pornography. Year by TV year, there is an ever-widening gap between the perceived tinselly cheerfulness of our collective Christmases Past and the grimy misanthropy pioneered by the soaps in the Eighties and which now seeps throughout the schedules, but if, during the season of The Suspension of Divine Disbelief, TV persists in reflecting too much warty real life, it's no wonder we turn off in favour of Playstation and the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire Quizbook. Denial may be a dangerous thing but at this time of year it's exactly what most of us need to get by. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, perhaps, The League of Gentlemen revealed the most nightmarish vision of Christmas. Never laugh-out-loud funny, always compulsive and often genuinely spine-chilling, it is surely no coincidence that all the multifariously horrifying residents of Royston Vaysey not only bear a spooky likeness to Fred and Rosemary West but that their grotesque moral universe reflects the Wests' own warped insularity. For an island of privacy-loving curtain-twitchers, Royston Vaysey nicely reflects the underbelly of a Britain writ inescapably, claustrophobically local. In The League 's sweaty hands, line-dancing suddenly looks like synchronised mass hysteria, excess consumption of cheese is the fastest route to a night-time vision of hell, and halo-haired choirboys are not merely the tragic victims of those who, like Herr Lipp, enjoy paedophiliac tendencies, but might collude in the exploitation even as they harbour their own dark, satanic secrets. </p> <p>Admittedly, I had consumed a lot of Stilton prior to watching The League, but I can't entirely blame the cheese for the bad night's sleep that followed: as a child Bernice, the troubled vicar, had lost her mother to a murderous Santa, the circus ringmaster Papa Lazarou - a Black and White Minstrel to send, as Herr Lipp would have it, 'goosesteps up your spine' - who turned up in the final frames to capture Bernice from inside the sanctuary of her own church just as we were in grave danger of something that might have approached a happy ending. I fear for the sleeping patterns of small children who, furtively, might have treated themselves to The League. Several prescriptive nightly doses of 'Walking in the Air' may well be required. </p> <p>In an elegiac The Last Fast Show Ever (an embarrassment of riches: 120 minutes worth, spread over three successive nights) Swiss Toni finally resorted to counselling to overcome his analogy addiction. For Toni, anything from fishing to crashing a car is 'like making love to a beautiful woman', but as the Fast Show team fleshed out many of their best-loved characters, we learnt that Toni may not, in fact, ever have made love to a beautiful woman. Which was, oddly, sort of sad. </p> <p>Revelations came thick, if not very fast: the horribly familiar Competitive Dad (well, almost every home I know has one) was revealed to be merely the product of a difficult relationship with his own Competitive Dad; meanwhile, the two Kenneths from Suits You were given a bit of murky motivation for their idiosyncratic salesmanship (homophobic or gay? You decide). After a swift grimace, Ted finally agreed that Ralph might fill the hole left by the death of Mrs Ted (emotionally, if not necessarily physically), while a 'fed up, shagged out' Ron Manager decided to take his flailing punditry to ITV on the reasonable grounds that 'I've not got it in me any more'. Finally, shortly after being brought 'a bucketful of ankles' while clearly vay vay drunk, Rowley Birkin QC actually died, apparently at the age of 82. It was both the end of an era and a cue for more Stilton. </p> <p>I watched The Sleeper mostly to see why Michelle Collins was in it, but got sucked into the story of the Moons, set against a background slurry of seasonal dysfunction, ouija boards and murderous paranoia, not to mention cowshit. Michelle proved she can do hoity-toity (at least until forced by the plot to get in touch with her inner Cindy Beale) but George Cole was wasted in a pointless role that appeared to exist simply to feed lines to Anna Massey's Miss Marple-ish spinster, hell-bent on investigating the whereabouts of her friend Kath, who had gone mysteriously awol at Christmas from the old people's home where they both lived. Unsure of whether to play it spooky or silly, plotwise The Sleeper got caught in a bit of a dramatic quagmire - can a farmyard really be sold as sinister, unless it is in the locality of Royston Vaysey? - but the acting, particularly from the older cast members, was suitably grand guignol. Which, come to think of it, would make a fine name for a new and challenging brand of cheese. </p> <p>The week's most unlikely-sounding treat was, however, Donovan Quick, in which Colin Firth played the eponymous and mysterious southern stranger with a fondness for Cervantes who turns up north of the border to rent a room from the, yes, wholly dysfunctional Pannick family. Indeed, there is unlikely to be a more affecting drama set against the backdrop of rail and bus privatisation. </p> <p>Harassed, alcoholic Lucy was in a bad relationship with arrogant, violent, unemployed Clive, while her younger brother, Sandy, had a learning disability and an unsuitable crush on a lovely Pakistani undergraduate; Lucy's unemployed son, Jim, meanwhile, spent all day on the sofa fighting with Lucy's semi-senile gran (the wonderful Liz Smith, in a slip) for control of the remote. So far, so seasonal. But when the evil Windmill company cut out the train stop nearest to Sandy's day centre, Donovan set up his own bus route, Quick and Pannick, and employed Sandy as conductor. 'Donovan's made me a company director!' said Sandy, proudly. 'Shouldn't you finish the rocket you were making out of a squeezy bottle first?' said Lucy, with some justification. It was lovely stuff - emotionally dark, as befits any contemporary drama with aspirations to Say Something, but leavened by touches of Ealing Comedy, sharp performances and a deft script. The ending was bitter-sweet, too, but Colin Firth didn't get his kit off. Still, you can't have everything - especially at Christmas. </p> <p>Unless you're Damien Hirst who, if Channel 4's Life and Death and Damien Hirst was anything to go by, appears to have it all and more besides. I was expecting snarling Britart-brattiness, but Hirst is an apparently doting husband and father who enjoys nothing more than drizzling balsamic vinegar over something he's just rustled up in his gleaming moderne-rustic country kitchen for 20 of his closest friends, so this sweetly revealing documentary looked like a cross between Jamie Oliver's ads for Sainsbury's and the final frames of It's a Wonderful Life. If, that is, instead of an Etch-A-Sketch, Jimmy Stewart had bought his kids a gigantic 'build your own human body' kit; 16,000 pills displayed in a glass cabinet or a vast tank filled with Koi carp and dead computers. In among schedules packed with angrily disenfranchised secular schizophrenics, all loathing the season's enforced unselfishness but, none the less, passively-aggressively submitting to a seething collective sense of duty, at least, thanks to the Hirsts, we got to watch one happy family this Christmas.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Royle Family BBC1 Cold Feet ITV The League of Gentlemen BBC2 The Last Fast Show Ever BBC2 The Sleeper BBC1 Donovan Quick BBC1 Life and Death and Damien Hirst C4 So, the Christmas ratings were dismal. Titanic floundered (though given that Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On' is, famously, the nation's most requested funeral dirge, maybe that came as no surprise to anybody outside the BBC), while The Royle Family just scraped into the top 10. It was a good episode, but perhaps the Royles reflect just a little too accurately the average blackly dysfunctional family Christmas to be classed as escapist entertainment. Indeed, this year a more ironically downbeat selection of seasonal offerings it would have been hard to assemble. Who could possibly have watched Charlotte Church, lip gloss a-quiver through 'Silent Night' during Sunday's Christmas in the Holy Land, without recognising that, outside, it was anything but. Even the final episode in the penultimate series of Cold Feet - which, to my mind, always vacillates uneasily between toe-curling sentimentality and faux-grittiness - decided it couldn't face a wedding without invoking, for our light comedic delectation, domestic violence, infertility, adultery, divorce and pornography. Year by TV year, there is an ever-widening gap between the perceived tinselly cheerfulness of our collective Christmases Past and the grimy misanthropy pioneered by the soaps in the Eighties and which now seeps throughout the schedules, but if, during the season of The Suspension of Divine Disbelief, TV persists in reflecting too much warty real life, it's no wonder we turn off in favour of Playstation and the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire Quizbook. Denial may be a dangerous thing but at this time of year it's exactly what most of us need to get by. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, The League of Gentlemen revealed the most nightmarish vision of Christmas. Never laugh-out-loud funny, always compulsive and often genuinely spine-chilling, it is surely no coincidence that all the multifariously horrifying residents of Royston Vaysey not only bear a spooky likeness to Fred and Rosemary West but that their grotesque moral universe reflects the Wests' own warped insularity. For an island of privacy-loving curtain-twitchers, Royston Vaysey nicely reflects the underbelly of a Britain writ inescapably, claustrophobically local. In The League 's sweaty hands, line-dancing suddenly looks like synchronised mass hysteria, excess consumption of cheese is the fastest route to a night-time vision of hell, and halo-haired choirboys are not merely the tragic victims of those who, like Herr Lipp, enjoy paedophiliac tendencies, but might collude in the exploitation even as they harbour their own dark, satanic secrets. Admittedly, I had consumed a lot of Stilton prior to watching The League, but I can't entirely blame the cheese for the bad night's sleep that followed: as a child Bernice, the troubled vicar, had lost her mother to a murderous Santa, the circus ringmaster Papa Lazarou - a Black and White Minstrel to send, as Herr Lipp would have it, 'goosesteps up your spine' - who turned up in the final frames to capture Bernice from inside the sanctuary of her own church just as we were in grave danger of something that might have approached a happy ending. I fear for the sleeping patterns of small children who, furtively, might have treated themselves to The League. Several prescriptive nightly doses of 'Walking in the Air' may well be required. In an elegiac The Last Fast Show Ever (an embarrassment of riches: 120 minutes worth, spread over three successive nights) Swiss Toni finally resorted to counselling to overcome his analogy addiction. For Toni, anything from fishing to crashing a car is 'like making love to a beautiful woman', but as the Fast Show team fleshed out many of their best-loved characters, we learnt that Toni may not, in fact, ever have made love to a beautiful woman. Which was, oddly, sort of sad. Revelations came thick, if not very fast: the horribly familiar Competitive Dad (well, almost every home I know has one) was revealed to be merely the product of a difficult relationship with his own Competitive Dad; meanwhile, the two Kenneths from Suits You were given a bit of murky motivation for their idiosyncratic salesmanship (homophobic or gay? You decide). After a swift grimace, Ted finally agreed that Ralph might fill the hole left by the death of Mrs Ted (emotionally, if not necessarily physically), while a 'fed up, shagged out' Ron Manager decided to take his flailing punditry to ITV on the reasonable grounds that 'I've not got it in me any more'. Finally, shortly after being brought 'a bucketful of ankles' while clearly vay vay drunk, Rowley Birkin QC actually died, apparently at the age of 82. It was both the end of an era and a cue for more Stilton. I watched The Sleeper mostly to see why Michelle Collins was in it, but got sucked into the story of the Moons, set against a background slurry of seasonal dysfunction, ouija boards and murderous paranoia, not to mention cowshit. Michelle proved she can do hoity-toity (at least until forced by the plot to get in touch with her inner Cindy Beale) but George Cole was wasted in a pointless role that appeared to exist simply to feed lines to Anna Massey's Miss Marple-ish spinster, hell-bent on investigating the whereabouts of her friend Kath, who had gone mysteriously awol at Christmas from the old people's home where they both lived. Unsure of whether to play it spooky or silly, plotwise The Sleeper got caught in a bit of a dramatic quagmire - can a farmyard really be sold as sinister, unless it is in the locality of Royston Vaysey? - but the acting, particularly from the older cast members, was suitably grand guignol. Which, come to think of it, would make a fine name for a new and challenging brand of cheese. The week's most unlikely-sounding treat was, however, Donovan Quick, in which Colin Firth played the eponymous and mysterious southern stranger with a fondness for Cervantes who turns up north of the border to rent a room from the, yes, wholly dysfunctional Pannick family. Indeed, there is unlikely to be a more affecting drama set against the backdrop of rail and bus privatisation. Harassed, alcoholic Lucy was in a bad relationship with arrogant, violent, unemployed Clive, while her younger brother, Sandy, had a learning disability and an unsuitable crush on a lovely Pakistani undergraduate; Lucy's unemployed son, Jim, meanwhile, spent all day on the sofa fighting with Lucy's semi-senile gran (the wonderful Liz Smith, in a slip) for control of the remote. So far, so seasonal. But when the evil Windmill company cut out the train stop nearest to Sandy's day centre, Donovan set up his own bus route, Quick and Pannick, and employed Sandy as conductor. 'Donovan's made me a company director!' said Sandy, proudly. 'Shouldn't you finish the rocket you were making out of a squeezy bottle first?' said Lucy, with some justification. It was lovely stuff - emotionally dark, as befits any contemporary drama with aspirations to Say Something, but leavened by touches of Ealing Comedy, sharp performances and a deft script. The ending was bitter-sweet, too, but Colin Firth didn't get his kit off. Still, you can't have everything - especially at Christmas. Unless you're Damien Hirst who, if Channel 4's Life and Death and Damien Hirst was anything to go by, appears to have it all and more besides. I was expecting snarling Britart-brattiness, but Hirst is an apparently doting husband and father who enjoys nothing more than drizzling balsamic vinegar over something he's just rustled up in his gleaming moderne-rustic country kitchen for 20 of his closest friends, so this sweetly revealing documentary looked like a cross between Jamie Oliver's ads for Sainsbury's and the final frames of It's a Wonderful Life. If, that is, instead of an Etch-A-Sketch, Jimmy Stewart had bought his kids a gigantic 'build your own human body' kit; 16,000 pills displayed in a glass cabinet or a vast tank filled with Koi carp and dead computers. In among schedules packed with angrily disenfranchised secular schizophrenics, all loathing the season's enforced unselfishness but, none the less, passively-aggressively submitting to a seething collective sense of duty, at least, thanks to the Hirsts, we got to watch one happy family this Christmas.",

      "body": "<p>Kung-fu, drugs and rock 'n' roll are a heady mixture. They provide the basic ingredients to the new year's opening batch of superior films. January will be a good month for movie-going, with the opening of the three films that topped the autumn class of Oscar hopefuls in the States. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Traffic and Almost Famous are compelling choices from three of the most entertaining and thoughtful filmmakers currently working in Hollywood: Ang Lee, Steven Soderbergh and Cameron Crowe. With a Hollywood strike looming, prestige movies could theoretically soon be few and far between. </p> <p>Lee's Chinese-language martial arts epic Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was not filmed in Hollywood, but its stunning marriage of action and drama, myth and romance make it wonderfully accessible. Traffic, directed by the resurgent wunderkind Soderbergh and starring Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas, is an ambitious and complex film that looks at the drugs trade from every available angle, admirably steering clear of moral judgments and earning comparison with Z and The Battle of Algiers. Crowe's semi-autobiographical Almost Famous is a bitter-sweet coming-of-age film set in the early Seventies about a 15-year-old rock journalist (memorably played by the wide-eyed Patrick Fugit) who joins an up and coming band for their eventful north American tour. </p> <p>Two other films that succeeded in the States and are due for imminent release are Cast Away (12 January), with Tom Hanks as a modern-day Robinson Crusoe, and What Women Want (2 February), a high-concept fantasy about a lecherous ad man who can read women's thoughts, in which Mel Gibson makes an engaging romantic comedy debut. </p> <p>The coming year also promises to throw up answers to a number of fascinating conundrums. If the reports are to believed, Leonardo DiCaprio spent as much time partying and canoodling with supermodel Giselle as he did on the set of Martin Scorsese's period gangster epic Gangs of New York. Following the relative disappointments of The Beach and Bringing out the Dead, both careers could do with a boost. In contrast, hot from the success of Gladiator, Ridley Scott should be bulletproof, but by making Hannibal, the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, he is back in the firing line. The film, which opens in February, is arguably the most eagerly anticipated sequel since The Godfather Part II. Like the second Godfather movie, the cast has seen some changes: Anthony Hopkins is back but Jodie Foster makes way for another cerebral performer - Julianne Moore. </p> <p>The adaptation of Thomas Harris's bestseller is one of a handful of big books heading for the big screen in 2001. There is the daring and box-office friendly casting of Texan Ren\u00e9e Zellweger as the eponymous Sloane Ranger in Bridget Jones's Diary (summer), counting the calories as well as the cost of getting involved with unsuitable Hoorays. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant provide the beefcake. Nicolas Cage, currently showing his softer side in Family Man, gives it another outing in Captain Corelli's Mandolin (scheduled for May), the Second World War romance directed by John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) and co-starring Penelope Cruz. This could be big year for Cruz, who also stars alongside cowboy Matt Damon in the western All The Pretty Horses, adapted from Cormac McCarthy's bestseller and directed by Billy Bob Thornton. Towards the end of the year, she'll appear with Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, the remake of the mind-bending Spanish thriller Open Your Eyes. </p> <p>But the year's most interesting excursion into the Wild West is likely to be prolific British director Michael Winterbottom's The Claim (2 February), a reworking of The Mayor of Casterbridge transposed to the Californian gold rush, which has great advance word. </p> <p>Closer to home, a number of new filmmakers are set to emerge in the coming months. Apart from the jubilation that greeted Billy Elliot, last year's homegrown screen fillers were a generally unin spiring crop. Thankfully, next year looks promising. First, Jonathan Glazer's colourful gangster movie Sexy Beast, released next month, will bring zest to a worryingly moribund genre; Jamie Thraves's loose and languid portrait of twentysomething slackerdom, The Lowdown (26 Jan), is both rewarding and frustrating. But The Last Resort (16 March) is probably the best of the Brit bunch.

      "bodyText": "Kung-fu, drugs and rock 'n' roll are a heady mixture. They provide the basic ingredients to the new year's opening batch of superior films. January will be a good month for movie-going, with the opening of the three films that topped the autumn class of Oscar hopefuls in the States. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Traffic and Almost Famous are compelling choices from three of the most entertaining and thoughtful filmmakers currently working in Hollywood: Ang Lee, Steven Soderbergh and Cameron Crowe. With a Hollywood strike looming, prestige movies could theoretically soon be few and far between. Lee's Chinese-language martial arts epic Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was not filmed in Hollywood, but its stunning marriage of action and drama, myth and romance make it wonderfully accessible. Traffic, directed by the resurgent wunderkind Soderbergh and starring Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas, is an ambitious and complex film that looks at the drugs trade from every available angle, admirably steering clear of moral judgments and earning comparison with Z and The Battle of Algiers. Crowe's semi-autobiographical Almost Famous is a bitter-sweet coming-of-age film set in the early Seventies about a 15-year-old rock journalist (memorably played by the wide-eyed Patrick Fugit) who joins an up and coming band for their eventful north American tour. Two other films that succeeded in the States and are due for imminent release are Cast Away (12 January), with Tom Hanks as a modern-day Robinson Crusoe, and What Women Want (2 February), a high-concept fantasy about a lecherous ad man who can read women's thoughts, in which Mel Gibson makes an engaging romantic comedy debut. The coming year also promises to throw up answers to a number of fascinating conundrums. If the reports are to believed, Leonardo DiCaprio spent as much time partying and canoodling with supermodel Giselle as he did on the set of Martin Scorsese's period gangster epic Gangs of New York. Following the relative disappointments of The Beach and Bringing out the Dead, both careers could do with a boost. In contrast, hot from the success of Gladiator, Ridley Scott should be bulletproof, but by making Hannibal, the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, he is back in the firing line. The film, which opens in February, is arguably the most eagerly anticipated sequel since The Godfather Part II. Like the second Godfather movie, the cast has seen some changes: Anthony Hopkins is back but Jodie Foster makes way for another cerebral performer - Julianne Moore. The adaptation of Thomas Harris's bestseller is one of a handful of big books heading for the big screen in 2001. There is the daring and box-office friendly casting of Texan Ren\u00e9e Zellweger as the eponymous Sloane Ranger in Bridget Jones's Diary (summer), counting the calories as well as the cost of getting involved with unsuitable Hoorays. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant provide the beefcake. Nicolas Cage, currently showing his softer side in Family Man, gives it another outing in Captain Corelli's Mandolin (scheduled for May), the Second World War romance directed by John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) and co-starring Penelope Cruz. This could be big year for Cruz, who also stars alongside cowboy Matt Damon in the western All The Pretty Horses, adapted from Cormac McCarthy's bestseller and directed by Billy Bob Thornton. Towards the end of the year, she'll appear with Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, the remake of the mind-bending Spanish thriller Open Your Eyes. But the year's most interesting excursion into the Wild West is likely to be prolific British director Michael Winterbottom's The Claim (2 February), a reworking of The Mayor of Casterbridge transposed to the Californian gold rush, which has great advance word. Closer to home, a number of new filmmakers are set to emerge in the coming months. Apart from the jubilation that greeted Billy Elliot, last year's homegrown screen fillers were a generally unin spiring crop. Thankfully, next year looks promising. First, Jonathan Glazer's colourful gangster movie Sexy Beast, released next month, will bring zest to a worryingly moribund genre; Jamie Thraves's loose and languid portrait of twentysomething slackerdom, The Lowdown (26 Jan), is both rewarding and frustrating. But The Last Resort (16 March) is probably the best of the Brit bunch. Paul Pawlikowski's artful tale of a Russian asylum seeker and her unlikely romance won the Best New British Feature award at the Edinburgh Film Festival and deserves to be a success. There are also interesting movies from a couple of established British directors. Ken Loach changes his locale to Los Angeles but raises familiar social issues in the strike drama Bread and Roses (27 April). In similar vein, writer Jimmy McGovern and director Stephen Frears collaborate in Liam (23 February), a Depression-era drama about a family riven by fascism. Another festival favourite due for release on 9 February is the Swedish film Faithless, Liv Ullmann's examination of the fallout from a middle-aged affair, written and apparently inspired by Ingmar Bergman. Finally, 'The Dancer in the Dark award' for Scandinavian eccentricity should go to director Ray Andersson for Songs from the Second Floor (16 February), a quasi-musical about modern disaffection and individual angst.

      "body": "<p>Britain's top spies will be given the right to publish their memoirs under sweeping plans being drawn up to replace the current tough official secrets laws, The Observer has learnt.</p> <p>A series of high-profile court cases and the impending publication of the memoirs of former MI5 chief Stella Rimington have forced Ministers and senior civil servants to draw up plans for legislation to replace the Official Secrets Act if Labour wins the next election.</p> <p>The existing Act was drafted before the collapse of the Soviet Union and was fiercely criticised by the Labour Party in opposition when it was introduced in 1989.</p> <p>Ministers now believe that the more draconian elements of the Act have become irrelevant in the post-Cold War era. The reforms, which would affect military and intelligence staff, would mean that only those accused of the most serious breaches of national security would face prosecution. As it stands, there is not even a definition of 'national security' in British law.</p> <p>Ministers are determined to bring British official secrecy legislation closer to the American system, where former intelligence officers can publish memoirs with the approval of an independent committee. At present, members of the British intelligence services are pledged to secrecy for life. It is likely that reforms would also give more teeth to the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee, which oversees the work of MI5 and MI6.</p> <p>Senior officials at the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence are already working on a definition of national security based on advice from the Defence Advisory Committee, which produces guidelines for journalists and editors on official secrecy matters.</p> <p>Minutes from the December meeting of the committee show that this process is well under way in relation to the new Human Rights and Freedom of Information legislation, where government officials have been instructed to use only the strictest definition of a breach of national security - 'when there is a grave threat to the State'.</p> <p>The intelligence services and senior Whitehall officials are braced for reform, but will wait for the outcome of the trial of former MI5 officer David Shayler in April before acting. Lawyers for Shayler will argue that the Official Secrets Act breaches his right to freedom of expression under new human rights legislation. In particular, the Act does not let Shayler claim he was acting in the public interest when he made allegations about incompetence and illegal activity in the intelligence services. If he wins, the already shaky legislation will be left in tatters.</p> <p>The driving force behind the reforms is the Attorney-General, Lord Williams of Mostyn, who is known to be furious about a series of embarrassing official secrets cases brought against journalists and their sources.</p> <p>In November, Lord Williams was forced to intervene to have the case against Lieutenant-Colonel Nigel Wylde dropped due to a lack of evidence. Wylde was accused of passing information to journalist Tony Geraghty about intelligence activity in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>A similar case involving the Northern Ireland editor of the Sunday Times, Liam Clarke, and undercover agent 'Martin Ingram' was also dropped. This year The Observer and the Guardian fought off attempts by the police to obtain material relating to the Shayler case.</p> <p>There is also likely to be pressure from Lord Chancellor Derry Irvine, who said: 'Newspapers could be prosecuted for disclosing an Irangate in this country.'</p> <p>Deborah Clark, director of public affairs at the civil rights organisation Liberty, said: 'Successive governments have used an extensive framework of secrecy to suppress information and prosecute whistle-blowers on the ground of national security.

      "bodyText": "Britain's top spies will be given the right to publish their memoirs under sweeping plans being drawn up to replace the current tough official secrets laws, The Observer has learnt. A series of high-profile court cases and the impending publication of the memoirs of former MI5 chief Stella Rimington have forced Ministers and senior civil servants to draw up plans for legislation to replace the Official Secrets Act if Labour wins the next election. The existing Act was drafted before the collapse of the Soviet Union and was fiercely criticised by the Labour Party in opposition when it was introduced in 1989. Ministers now believe that the more draconian elements of the Act have become irrelevant in the post-Cold War era. The reforms, which would affect military and intelligence staff, would mean that only those accused of the most serious breaches of national security would face prosecution. As it stands, there is not even a definition of 'national security' in British law. Ministers are determined to bring British official secrecy legislation closer to the American system, where former intelligence officers can publish memoirs with the approval of an independent committee. At present, members of the British intelligence services are pledged to secrecy for life. It is likely that reforms would also give more teeth to the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee, which oversees the work of MI5 and MI6. Senior officials at the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence are already working on a definition of national security based on advice from the Defence Advisory Committee, which produces guidelines for journalists and editors on official secrecy matters. Minutes from the December meeting of the committee show that this process is well under way in relation to the new Human Rights and Freedom of Information legislation, where government officials have been instructed to use only the strictest definition of a breach of national security - 'when there is a grave threat to the State'. The intelligence services and senior Whitehall officials are braced for reform, but will wait for the outcome of the trial of former MI5 officer David Shayler in April before acting. Lawyers for Shayler will argue that the Official Secrets Act breaches his right to freedom of expression under new human rights legislation. In particular, the Act does not let Shayler claim he was acting in the public interest when he made allegations about incompetence and illegal activity in the intelligence services. If he wins, the already shaky legislation will be left in tatters. The driving force behind the reforms is the Attorney-General, Lord Williams of Mostyn, who is known to be furious about a series of embarrassing official secrets cases brought against journalists and their sources. In November, Lord Williams was forced to intervene to have the case against Lieutenant-Colonel Nigel Wylde dropped due to a lack of evidence. Wylde was accused of passing information to journalist Tony Geraghty about intelligence activity in Northern Ireland. A similar case involving the Northern Ireland editor of the Sunday Times, Liam Clarke, and undercover agent 'Martin Ingram' was also dropped. This year The Observer and the Guardian fought off attempts by the police to obtain material relating to the Shayler case. There is also likely to be pressure from Lord Chancellor Derry Irvine, who said: 'Newspapers could be prosecuted for disclosing an Irangate in this country.' Deborah Clark, director of public affairs at the civil rights organisation Liberty, said: 'Successive governments have used an extensive framework of secrecy to suppress information and prosecute whistle-blowers on the ground of national security. Reform of the Official Secrets Act is long overdue. This Government opposed the OSA while in opposition. Half-hearted measures will not do, it must make amends by narrowly defining 'national security' and allowing access to information which doesn't pose a risk to it.' Home Office Minister Mike O'Brien indicated that the Government was preparing to look again at the Official Secrets Act in February 2000 during the committee stage of the Freedom of Information Bill. Though he rejected attempts by Liberal Democrat MP David Heath to reform the Act by introduc-ing a new clause into the Freedom of Information legislation, he admitted that he was not opposed to reform.",

He met explorer Robert Peary in 1887 when serving in a supplies shop in Washington DC. Peary first employed Henson as his servant to help him chart the jungles of Nicaragua.

The critics of Peary and Henson had claimed that the two could not have travelled 30 miles a day as they claimed during their final five days on the way to the Pole. Suffering from frostbite, Peary was pulled on a sled. Earlier this year, two Canadians attempted a similar high-speed journey to the North Pole to prove the feat was possible.

'Of course, it was terrible what happened,' said Belfast-based Mark Blackburne. 'But it's worth remembering that Titanic was a triumph of engineering and architecture, which means an awful lot to people around the world, especially in Belfast where it was built. Titanic II will be a fitting memorial to those that designed, constructed, worked and sailed on the Titanic.' Blackburne and his South African partner, Sarel Gous, aim to reproduce the splendour of the luxury liner. Going one step beyond James Cameron's recreation for his blockbuster movie, Titanic, RMS Titanic Shipping Holdings Ltd plans to build Titanic II in Belfast, where the first ship was constructed. Titanic II's interior has been designed to match the opulence of its celebrated predecessor. The ship will feature a permanent museum displaying original artefacts from the vessel and the grand staircase will be modelled exactly on Titanic's. The entrepreneurs' plan hinges on a flotation on the Stock Exchange in March, when investors will be asked to buy shares in the name of the ship that sank in 1912. If Blackburne, the chairman of the Ulster Titanic Society, and Gous raise \u00a310 million from the share option, then several corporate banks will lend the company up to half of the estimated \u00a3360m needed to recreate Titanic. Titanic II will be larger and heavier than its predecessor. According to Blackburne, Titanic II will be 1,200ft long and weigh 96,000 tonnes. The first Titanic was 882ft and weighed 46,000 tonnes. Unlike the original vessel, the poor and huddled masses - typified by Leonardo DiCaprio in the film - would be unable to afford to travel on Titanic II. Prices for a week on board will range from $15,000 for the most luxurious cabins to the cheapest, a mere snip at $1,500. Blackburne denies that the project is pie-in-the-sky, insisting that it makes sound business sense. 'We're getting around 80 calls per week, mainly from rich Americans who want to book tickets on Titanic II even though it isn't even built yet. Thousands have called us via the Titanic societies on the internet, inquiring about when they will be able to sail on it. 'The company has spent more than \u00a310,000 on marketing and research and we think this is a very viable business proposition. Titanic's name alone is worth its weight in gold. 'Titanic II will hold 1,500 passengers, and judging by the number of inquiries we've got since we started this project three years ago we could fill the ship several times over.' Blackburne's alliance with Gous began after he presented an earlier proposal to Titanic's builders, Harland and Wolff, for a yacht with a Titanic theme inside. 'When I went to Harland and Wolff with my idea for a theme yacht in homage to Titanic, a kind of floating museum if you like, the company told me Sarel had been speaking to them about a more challenging project, to replicate the original Titanic. Harland and Wolff were consultants for my project and Sarel's, so it was natural we came together,' he said.

'March to April will be a critical period for Titanic II. Once we get the initial capital we aim to offer the project to Harland and Wolff in Belfast - that's the first option given the historical connection to the first Titanic.' Gous added that he hoped the British Government would also provide backing, particularly as Titanic II could save thousands of jobs under threat at the ailing shipyard in east Belfast. The two men said investors would be able to make money even before a single bolt was riveted into Titanic II's hull.

      "bodyText": "Seventy-five homeless people were forced to sleep rough on the streets of London last night, with the risk of freezing to death, because they did not meet Government criteria for a place in a shelter, the charity Crisis said. In an interview yesterday on BBC Radio Four's Today programme, Shaks Gosh, the chief executive of Crisis, said her charity had been forced to send the homeless back out on the streets when its winter short-stay shelters shut yesterday morning because there were no beds available in government-assisted permanent shelters. Louise Casey, head of the Government's Rough Sleepers' Unit, dismissed the claims as 'scaremongering', adding: 'There is absolutely no reason at all for anyone in London, or anywhere else, to die out on the streets.' For the last few months rough sleepers have only been granted access to a shelter if they have a Government directory number, distributed by state-backed charity workers. To get a number, a rough sleeper has to have been on the streets continuously for several months. Casey said that since Friday afternoon shelters had been authorised to take in homeless people regardless of whether they have a number. 'I really don't know why Shaks is saying this,' said Casey, adding it was 'just not the case' that charity workers had spent Friday night looking for shelter places for those faced with the prospect of spending last night on the streets. 'There were 74 vacancies for anyone in London yesterday,' she said. However, Shelterline, a free advice line that helps homeless people find beds, told The Observer it had experienced serious problems finding beds for single homeless men, and was not aware of the relaxing of criteria. Gosh added: 'There is a lack of transparency over how the rules for entering shelters are made. The people on the street are confused by it. If our advisers can't work it out, then what chance do the homeless have?' The attack by Crisis marks an unprecedented breaking of ranks among aid groups for the homeless.

      "bodyText": "The most haunted house in history is to be unmasked as Britain's biggest hoax. A new book written by one of the hoaxers will outrage believers and delight those who seek to disprove the existence of psychic phenomena. In We Faked the Ghosts of Borley Rectory, Louis Mayerling - for whom the house was a second home until its destruction by fire in 1938 - reveals for the first time how the 'hauntings' were created by the rectory's various inhabitants. He describes how they watched in amazement as the world fell for the elaborate hoax. An investigation carried out by the BBC the year before the fire, when Mayerling was 26, noted more than 2,000 incidents of paranormal activity and concluded that the hauntings were true. The Most Haunted House in England, a book by Harry Price, the most eminent psychical investigator of the time, who lived in the house for a year, cemented the rectory's position as the best documented case of haunting in the annals of psychical research. 'Harry's book became a sort of bible and foundation of knowledge to the thousands who, in that age of psychic phenomena, were keen to believe,' said Mayerling. 'Before long, Borley Rectory stories were practically a daily occurrence in the London newspapers: at the height of it all, we were visited by dozens of coaches packed with ghost-hunters each day. People were coming from as far away as America. 'I would love to say that there was a grain of truth in it all, but I felt that the book had to be written to reveal the farcical truth about the house - as personally experienced.' George Bernard Shaw, T.E. Lawrence, Sir Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, and Bernard Spilsbury, the Home Office criminal forensic scientist, were firm believers in the hauntings and attended s\u00e9ances at Borley. Even now, belief in the hauntings has remained so powerful that the case is still held up by believers as incontrovertible proof of the supernatural. Mayerling arrived in the house, on the Essex-Suffolk border, in 1918 to find the eccentric Rev Harry Bull and his family of 14 children taking active delight in perpetuating local stories of a spectral nun, a family ghost and paranormal activity in the area. 'The house was the embodiment of eccentricities of many kinds,' Mayerling remembered. He reveals in the book how a 'magic piano' that the Bulls claimed was played by spirit hands was in fact activated by the six-year-old Mayerling plucking the piano strings with a poker from the safety of a nearby gap in the wall. The infamous examples of poltergeist activity were perpetrated by various servants and children who were, Mayerling claims, encouraged by the Bulls to exploit the house's many hidden doors and passages. 'The example of paranormal activity that was given most publicity was the ringing of the servants' bells,' said Mayerling. 'That was simply activated by prodding the servants' bells through the barred windows over the well in the kitchen passage.' Britain's fascination with Borley peaked in the Thirties, when the Rev Lionel Foyster took over the parish with his wife Marianne. Foyster found it hard to survive on his church stipend of \u00a36 a week, and he and his wife decided that boosting the ghostly reputation of Borley was the best way to make ends meet. Mayerling, who had returned to live in the house with the Foysters, tells how the couple installed a new water heater which emitted heavy knocking sounds and proclaimed themselves horrified by the noises, and pitted the skirting boards with phosphorus powder which catches fire when exposed to the air. The couple encouraged Mayerling, still just a teenager, to walk the gardens at dusk in a black cape and turned-up collar - giving birth to the myth of a headless monk who took to writing cryptic messages on the walls of the house. 'Probably to save costs at Borley, sea-sand had been used in the walls in place of the regulation material. This caused a permanent dampness which swallowed up anything written on them in a matter of hours,' Mayerling said. 'Nevertheless, many scholars recognised the wall-writings as being genuine poltergeist activity and they were illustrated in the press across the world, adding a great stimulus to psychical research and Spiritualism.' Mayerling admits there was one incident he is unable to explain and which could prove there is still more to the Borley stories than meets the eye. In Easter 1935, Shaw, Norman, Spilsbury, Mayerling and Marianne Foyster attended a s\u00e9ance at Borley. 'We chose an ill-lit and underground cellar at about midnight and sat in silence,' he remembered. 'Someone gave a nervous cough and was about to speak when an extraordinary thing happened: the kitchen bells seemed to clang together in one single clash.' Apart from those sitting at the table, the house was empty, and both Foyster and Mayerling knew from experience that it was impossible to make the bells ring at the same time. 'Norman jumped up and then there was a lightning strike of silver-blue light which appeared to implode from all walls and the ceiling of the cellars and then there was a dead silence,' he said. 'Shaw had been in the process of pushing a box of matches diagonally across the table and Norman was half off his chair in a turning position, but every member of the s\u00e9ance was struck with an instant paralysis which lasted about five seconds.' Afterwards, Mayerling was blinded - he eventually recovered sight in one eye - and Norman and Shaw refused to stay the night in the house. 'I can't explain that occurrence and, to be honest, it still makes me feel rather shaken,' he said. 'The rest of the hauntings were, without exception, the most successful hoax of the age, but that still sets my spine tingling.'",

The research team say they have picked funny stories to test their system because they reveal personal preferences more clearly than anything else. Your opinion of a book or CD is very often too tricky to grade.",

In the first salvo of what promises to be a bitter battle, posters will appear in London after the new year saying that Parliament should concentrate on education, health and crime rather than wasting valuable time pushing through an anti-hunting Bill. 'Do our politicians think that foxes are more important than people?' the advert asks. 'Time for Parliament to get real.' The high-risk advert uses black and white images of what have been described as 'depressing contemporary images'. A child being abused by an adult is followed by a pensioner cowering behind a door, a syringe full of drugs and a homeless person on the streets. The shock tactics were immediately condemned by animal welfare groups, which back a ban on hunting. 'These are the arguments of desperation,' said Mark Glover of Respect for Animals.

But Sam Butler, chairman of the Alliance's Campaign for Hunting, was unapologetic, saying it was now up to MPs to show where their priorities lay. 'Get on with the real job of dealing with serious social problems or continue with this obsession of seeking social revenge on law-abiding people,' he said. 'It does not matter which party they represent - MPs must get real or get out.' The Alliance is concerned that a majority of MPs is going to vote for a ban when the issue comes before the Commons next month. MPs will be given a free vote on three options - an outright ban, retention of the status quo or a 'middle way' that will allow hunting but with tougher restrictions and regulations. On the second reading of the Bill only a handful of Labour MPs voted against the move towards legislation, increasing concern among the pro-hunt lobby that hunting will soon be outlawed. But the Alliance received a boost when the Home Secre tary, Jack Straw, said he would not vote for an outright ban but would push for greater regulation. The Alliance will hold a rally in London in March which it hopes will attract 300,000 protesters. 'It seems now that even the Home Secretary realises there is no case to ban hunting, confirming the findings of the Government's own inquiry into hunting earlier this year,' Butler said. The Prime Minister has said that he is in favour of a total ban on hunting. \u0095 Tony Blair has claimed that Labour is now the party of economic competence, seizing the mantle held by the Tories for decades.

However, campaigners from organisations such as Prisoners Abroad and Fair Trials Abroad, or more often just friends and family, are working to highlight the issues raised by individual cases where people have been left languishing in foreign jails after being convicted on shaky evidence in courts where proceedings fall far short of accepted international standards of justice. It is not uncommon for trials to be held without the accused having access to legal advice or even an interpreter to allow them to make sense of what is going on. The Foreign Office takes the official line that it cannot interfere in the judicial systems of other nations but often will make discreet, behind-the-scenes appeals in high-profile cases. The following prisoners claim innocence and all are being held in conditions which breach international standards on human rights: David Chell , 57, a father-of-two from Stoke-on-Trent (right) faces the death sentence in Malaysia after being arrested in 1998 at Penang Airport.

      "body": "<p>An Essex Tory MP, a 'miracle-working' bishop and the Man In The White Suit are lining up to play a part in a compelling fight in the next general election.</p> <p>The battle for Ongar will turn on the close support Tory MP Eric Pickles has received from Bishop Michael Reid and the members of his Pentecostal church, which some describe as a 'disturbing religious sect'.</p> <p>Independent Martin Bell is to stand against Pickles for Brentwood and Ongar - the sixth safest Tory seat in the country - and may well pick up votes from those who are worried about the influence of Bishop Reid's hot-gospelling church in the constituency. Ex-members of the Peniel Pentecostal Church and others believe Pickles has 'an appalling conflict of interest' because the Brentwood and Ongar Conservatives have received thousands of pounds from church members.</p> <p>Reid - a former policeman turned insurance salesman turned evangelist - and his companies have donated at least \u00a32,500 to Pickles's fighting fund and the Conservative Party, while his church members have boosted Tory funds by around \u00a35,000.</p> <p>Pickles has defended members of the church 'as wonderfully normal people'. Others disagree.</p> <p>Former church member Caroline Green was a constituent of Pickles at the time she left the sect. She is one of those who will be writing to the Westminster standards ombudsman. She told The Observer: 'The bishop is a deeply troubled man who says terrible things about people who have opposed him. He has been excommunicated from another church, runs companies controlling millions of pounds and is very intimidating. How can you ask your MP to help you, if he supports the bishop?'</p> <p>Reid refers to himself and other evangelists as the 'anointed of God'. He was excommunicated for 'raillery' - a biblical term for slander - from Liverpool's Devonshire Road Christian Fellowship in 1969 and his 'flesh was committed to Satan'.</p> <p>The billboard next to Sainsbury's car park in Brentwood proclaims 'Miracles, Healing, Faith: Come and See' and shows Reid holding a small boy with one hand and a microphone in the other. The miracle mentioned in the billboard is not detailed.</p> <p>Miracles cited by the church have included the sensational recovery of a boy from leukaemia. The church explains the case of Sam Mildenberger as follows: 'The miracle was that he was cured of a rare form of leukaemia when he was 18 months old having been given an hour to live, Bishop Reid having been asked by his parents - who are not and never have been members of the Peniel church - to pray for him at Great Ormond Street Hospital. He died some eight years later from complications following a viral infection.'</p> <p>The church did not highlight the fact of a bone-marrow transplant in the boy's recovery.</p> <p>Mildenberger's death certificate shows he died from haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis - the rare form of leukaemia he had allegedly been miraculously cured of.

A Benin witchdoctor is supposed to have made it rain on one of Idahosa's ceremonies. Idahosa promised that the troublemaker would die. According to Reid, recorded on tape, 'The archbishop said by nine o'clock he'll be dead: \"I'll kill him\".

'I could hear chanting through the open door,' the US official said. 'Both were stripped naked.

He told The Observer: 'He was excommunicated for raillery', for slandering people. It was horrendous and destructive. He lived with us for a time. He would swing from one mood to another, at one moment contrite, the next a roaring lion.'</p> <p>A second doubter is the Rev Ian Wilson, best man at Reid's wedding in October 1971. Wilson, a Christian evangelist now living in Canada, told The Observer: 'He's the original spinmeister, a master salesman. He can be charming and then switch and be a frightening adversary who suppresses opposition with the most violent language. He caricatures people, vilifying them and impugning their character. I think Reid is a little Mussolini.'</p> <p>Mother-of-three Caroline Green, who fled the church three years ago, is a third sceptic. She said: 'It is hard to think of a less \"wonderfully normal\" person. Michael Reid has a toweringly strong personality, which he uses to dominate church members. Families end up being torn apart.

      "bodyText": "An Essex Tory MP, a 'miracle-working' bishop and the Man In The White Suit are lining up to play a part in a compelling fight in the next general election. The battle for Ongar will turn on the close support Tory MP Eric Pickles has received from Bishop Michael Reid and the members of his Pentecostal church, which some describe as a 'disturbing religious sect'. Independent Martin Bell is to stand against Pickles for Brentwood and Ongar - the sixth safest Tory seat in the country - and may well pick up votes from those who are worried about the influence of Bishop Reid's hot-gospelling church in the constituency. Ex-members of the Peniel Pentecostal Church and others believe Pickles has 'an appalling conflict of interest' because the Brentwood and Ongar Conservatives have received thousands of pounds from church members. Reid - a former policeman turned insurance salesman turned evangelist - and his companies have donated at least \u00a32,500 to Pickles's fighting fund and the Conservative Party, while his church members have boosted Tory funds by around \u00a35,000. Pickles has defended members of the church 'as wonderfully normal people'. Others disagree. Former church member Caroline Green was a constituent of Pickles at the time she left the sect. She is one of those who will be writing to the Westminster standards ombudsman. She told The Observer: 'The bishop is a deeply troubled man who says terrible things about people who have opposed him. He has been excommunicated from another church, runs companies controlling millions of pounds and is very intimidating. How can you ask your MP to help you, if he supports the bishop?' Reid refers to himself and other evangelists as the 'anointed of God'. He was excommunicated for 'raillery' - a biblical term for slander - from Liverpool's Devonshire Road Christian Fellowship in 1969 and his 'flesh was committed to Satan'. The billboard next to Sainsbury's car park in Brentwood proclaims 'Miracles, Healing, Faith: Come and See' and shows Reid holding a small boy with one hand and a microphone in the other. The miracle mentioned in the billboard is not detailed. Miracles cited by the church have included the sensational recovery of a boy from leukaemia. The church explains the case of Sam Mildenberger as follows: 'The miracle was that he was cured of a rare form of leukaemia when he was 18 months old having been given an hour to live, Bishop Reid having been asked by his parents - who are not and never have been members of the Peniel church - to pray for him at Great Ormond Street Hospital. He died some eight years later from complications following a viral infection.' The church did not highlight the fact of a bone-marrow transplant in the boy's recovery. Mildenberger's death certificate shows he died from haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis - the rare form of leukaemia he had allegedly been miraculously cured of. Dr Peter May, a GP and member of the General Synod of the Church of England, said: 'Viral illness is not mentioned in the death certificate. Cause of death is attributed to the rare form of leukaemia he was suffering. It led directly to his death. I have not found any evidence to support the claims of instantaneous cure of incurable diseases.' A spokesman for Great Ormond Street said they did not want to comment on any aspect of the alleged miracle. Reid now fronts a multi-million pound videos-to-insurance empire that includes one company, McCartney and Dowie Investment Management plc, which controls funds of \u00a341 million but paid only \u00a31,715 in tax in 1999. Reid's spokesman says the company is liable for tax only on its taxable profits. Members of his church are invited to tithe 10 per cent of their gross income and to take out insurance policies through the bishop's companies. Now the Bible school of which Reid is president is to be sued for assaulting children. Reid has been an enthusiastic supporter of corporal punishment or 'paddling' in the past. He has said: 'Children are little demons. They have foolishness in their hearts. You have a stick and they have a rear end. I believe in smacking them - a sharp smack on the rear end. But make sure it's a real shock.' The court proceedings, due to be issued in the new year, will turn on allegations of assault on two children, then aged seven and nine, who claim they suffered beatings by Peniel members. Their mother told The Observer yesterday: 'I am bringing this case not just for my children, but also for the other youngsters still inside this disturbing religious sect.' Reid, the church and the school deny any wrong-doing. The church says the bishop has never spanked a child personally, nor does he encourage churchgoers to use corporal punishment. At first glance, services at the Peniel headquarters, in Pilgrim's Hatch, Brentwood, are impressive. Hundreds of well-dressed, polite churchgoers make their devotions. The choir sways and sings in smiling harmony. But the main event is the sermon by Reid. At the service The Observer went to the bishop was sweetness and light.

According to Reid, recorded on tape, 'The archbishop said by nine o'clock he'll be dead: \"I'll kill him\". At a quarter past eight he dropped dead.' The church describes these allegations as bizarre and denies that Reid made such comments. Pickles took part in a photocall with Reid, Idahosa and a third controversial evangelist, Bishop Earl Pearly Paulk of Atlanta, Georgia, some years ago. Idahosa once claimed he raised eight people from the dead. The Advertising Standards Authority asked to see death certificates to prove they had been dead before Idahosa stepped in. No death certificates were provided, and the claim was dropped.

Bell said yesterday: 'I am not, nor have I ever been, a member of the Nazi party.' Donnelly said: 'A lot of people are writing off Bell as dead in the water, but the late Archbishop Idahosa isn't the only one who can bring back people from the dead.'",

      "body": "<p>Gun crime in Britain is soaring to record levels: executions, woundings and related incidents in the past year are set to be the highest ever, an investigation by The Observer has revealed.</p> <p>Preliminary figures show there have been more than 15,000 armed offences during 2000, up by almost 10 per cent over last year. The number of armed operations by police is also at a record level.</p> <p>In October, police in Nottingham began carrying handguns in hip holsters while patrolling two notorious estates. The routine arming of officers came in response to a spate of 14 shootings by criminals.</p> <p>'There is nothing exceptional,' Sean Price, Nottinghamshire's assistant chief constable, said. 'We are only doing what the police have always done - deploying the level of force appropriate to the threat.'</p> <p>Manchester, notorious for its levels of gun crime in the early Nineties, is also seeing a dramatic rise in such offences. In a three-week period in September alone, seven people were shot, including a 16-year-old murdered while riding his bike through a park.</p> <p>Although the use of firearms is a countrywide problem, it is most acute in the capital. In the past eight weeks there have been more than 35 reports of guns being fired illegally in London. The result: five deaths and 12 serious woundings.</p> <p>At the beginning of this month, there were four separate shooting incidents in 24 hours. The most recent killing took place on Christmas Day when 29-year-old Steven Grant was shot in the head outside an East End nightclub.</p> <p>Guns were once carried only to commit the most serious offences, but police now say they are increasingly used by small-time crooks such as burglars and low-level drug dealers. In London during November there were 21 cases of armed burglary and 71 muggings in which victims were threatened with guns. In the same month the capital saw arms used in 16 cases of grievous bodily harm and 77 other assaults. The figures also show that increasing numbers of petty criminals are carrying CS gas, supposedly to defend themselves.</p> <p>The true figures could be even higher, because victims of many of the most violent gun crimes are reluctant to involve the authorities. Two weeks ago, police received calls from two separate hospital casualty departments in north London about young men with gunshot wounds. It was soon established that both were shot during the same incident in Canning Town earlier, but had fled the scene to seek treatment alone to try to lessen the risk of capture.</p> <p>The use of guns outside the big towns and cities is rising too. Earlier this month shoppers were horrified to see two armed robbers shoot a security guard during a raid on a Securicor van in Hastings, East Sussex. The guard was wounded in the face and mouth.</p> <p>On the same day as the Hastings shooting, archaeologists found human remains on a site near Bolam, Co Durham. The victim turned out to be 22-year-old career criminal Mark Corley who disappeared from his Lincolnshire home earlier this year. He had died from a gunshot wound.</p> <p>A week earlier a man was shot dead in the tiny village of Woodleigh, in south Devon. It was the first firearms incident in the area for more than three years.</p> <p>Gun crime is contributing to a higher number of murders in key areas, even though the national rate of killings this year has fallen. The rate in Scotland has jumped by 20 per cent.</p> <p>Between 1997 and 1999 there were 429 murders in London, the highest two-year figure for more than 10 years. Reports of shots being fired or cars found riddled with bullets are increasingly common. Initiatives aimed at reducing the number of shootings have been set up in crime 'hotspots', including Hackney, Westminster, Lewisham and Brent.</p> <p>Nationally, one murder in 20 is now carried out with a firearm. The number of illegally held guns is estimated at three million, a third more than at the time of the 1996 Dunblane massacre. As handguns can no longer be bought or sold legally, the police believe the vast majority of those coming on to the market have been smuggled from abroad. A small proportion of the machine guns involved are 'reactivated' versions of weapons which have supposedly been rendered harmless.</p> <p>Gun murders are often linked to drugs. Although there have been police successes - particularly through Operation Trident, the initiative against drugs-related violence - such killings have a lower than average clear-up rate.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:tony.thompson@observer.co.uk\">tony.thompson@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Preliminary figures show there have been more than 15,000 armed offences during 2000, up by almost 10 per cent over last year. The number of armed operations by police is also at a record level. In October, police in Nottingham began carrying handguns in hip holsters while patrolling two notorious estates. The routine arming of officers came in response to a spate of 14 shootings by criminals. 'There is nothing exceptional,' Sean Price, Nottinghamshire's assistant chief constable, said. 'We are only doing what the police have always done - deploying the level of force appropriate to the threat.' Manchester, notorious for its levels of gun crime in the early Nineties, is also seeing a dramatic rise in such offences. In a three-week period in September alone, seven people were shot, including a 16-year-old murdered while riding his bike through a park. Although the use of firearms is a countrywide problem, it is most acute in the capital. In the past eight weeks there have been more than 35 reports of guns being fired illegally in London. The result: five deaths and 12 serious woundings. At the beginning of this month, there were four separate shooting incidents in 24 hours. The most recent killing took place on Christmas Day when 29-year-old Steven Grant was shot in the head outside an East End nightclub. Guns were once carried only to commit the most serious offences, but police now say they are increasingly used by small-time crooks such as burglars and low-level drug dealers. In London during November there were 21 cases of armed burglary and 71 muggings in which victims were threatened with guns. In the same month the capital saw arms used in 16 cases of grievous bodily harm and 77 other assaults. The figures also show that increasing numbers of petty criminals are carrying CS gas, supposedly to defend themselves. The true figures could be even higher, because victims of many of the most violent gun crimes are reluctant to involve the authorities. Two weeks ago, police received calls from two separate hospital casualty departments in north London about young men with gunshot wounds. It was soon established that both were shot during the same incident in Canning Town earlier, but had fled the scene to seek treatment alone to try to lessen the risk of capture. The use of guns outside the big towns and cities is rising too. Earlier this month shoppers were horrified to see two armed robbers shoot a security guard during a raid on a Securicor van in Hastings, East Sussex. The guard was wounded in the face and mouth. On the same day as the Hastings shooting, archaeologists found human remains on a site near Bolam, Co Durham. The victim turned out to be 22-year-old career criminal Mark Corley who disappeared from his Lincolnshire home earlier this year. He had died from a gunshot wound. A week earlier a man was shot dead in the tiny village of Woodleigh, in south Devon. It was the first firearms incident in the area for more than three years. Gun crime is contributing to a higher number of murders in key areas, even though the national rate of killings this year has fallen. The rate in Scotland has jumped by 20 per cent. Between 1997 and 1999 there were 429 murders in London, the highest two-year figure for more than 10 years. Reports of shots being fired or cars found riddled with bullets are increasingly common. Initiatives aimed at reducing the number of shootings have been set up in crime 'hotspots', including Hackney, Westminster, Lewisham and Brent. Nationally, one murder in 20 is now carried out with a firearm. The number of illegally held guns is estimated at three million, a third more than at the time of the 1996 Dunblane massacre. As handguns can no longer be bought or sold legally, the police believe the vast majority of those coming on to the market have been smuggled from abroad. A small proportion of the machine guns involved are 'reactivated' versions of weapons which have supposedly been rendered harmless. Gun murders are often linked to drugs. Although there have been police successes - particularly through Operation Trident, the initiative against drugs-related violence - such killings have a lower than average clear-up rate. tony.thompson@observer.co.uk",

A World Health Organisation league table this year placed the quality of Russia's health system at 130th out of 191 nations, far behind equally cash-strapped former Soviet states such as Kazakhstan (64th) and Belarus (72nd).

There are many hundreds of thousands of people like Harris among Britain's two million gym members. Annette Burgess, of the Northern Fitness and Education gym training network, says that while many gyms are good at keeping clients interested and motivated, staff at others - 'the majority, unfortunately' - rarely talk to members about their exercises, machines or fitness programmes. 'Quite often I go to gyms where the instructors are fiddling behind a desk or talking among themselves rather than giving members the advice and encouragement that can make the difference between them coming regularly or rarely,' says Burgess. Those who do lose interest quickly face an uphill struggle if they want to get their money back, especially from the big high street gym chains. Burgess advises everyone thinking about joining a gym to read the small print beforehand, be 'quite forceful' about getting a refund if they quickly stop going and to investigate the smaller private gyms and those run by local councils, where clients can 'pay as they go'. The Consumers' Association will this week publish an investigation into an industry which, despite concern that too many gyms do too little for their members, has doubled in size since 1994 and is set to keep on expanding - just like many of their clients' waistlines. denis.campbell@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>A retired bus driver's confession that he murdered seven mentally handicapped young women in northern Burgundy 20 years ago has unveiled a series of sex crimes and raised the possibility of the active involvement of the French social services.</p> <p>Emile Louis, 66, who drove young people in social services' care between their foster homes and schools during the late Seventies, said he had sex with the women, to which they freely consented. He confessed he had felt 'uncontrollable urges' to murder his victims, aged between 16 and 29.</p> <p>Louis told police he buried all seven bodies on the banks of the River Serein in Rouvray, near Auxerre. So far only one female skeleton has been found and it has yet to be identified.</p> <p>Louis cannot be convicted for the killings because under French law a suspect cannot be charged with murder more than 10 years after the crimes. Families of the victims have called for the time period of 10 years to start from the date when the bodies are found. Louis is being held for kidnapping, for which there is no statute of limitations. But, if the bodies are found and identified, Louis could be freed, since he cannot be charged with their murder.</p> <p>The case of the disparues has shocked France and left many questions unanswered. How could seven young women, several of whom had no living natural parents, simply disappear without the affair causing a national scandal at the time?</p> <p>Why did police investigators fail to spot the links between the disappearances, when several women lived with foster families in the same small village and four went to the same school in Auxerre? Why did they and the social services think each girl was a runaway? How could Louis, who has served jail terms for sexual offences, not have been charged with their murders?</p> <p>But Louis's case may just be the tip of the iceberg in a region coming under intense scrutiny for its police and judicial incompetence as well as for the dubious management of its homes for handicapped children.</p> <p>In another case, a 19-year-old girl called Huguette was found wandering the streets of Auxerre in January 1984. She told police she had been chained up for nearly three months in a cellar under a house in a nearby village. She claimed to have been tortured and raped, and told police that another girl was still there. Police officers found Michaela, 22, in the cellar, naked and suspended from a ladder by her wrists.</p> <p>The owners of the house, Claude and Monique Dunand, had placed small ads in local papers and at employment agencies to recruit girls to look after 'an ageing, sick aunt'.

      "bodyText": "A retired bus driver's confession that he murdered seven mentally handicapped young women in northern Burgundy 20 years ago has unveiled a series of sex crimes and raised the possibility of the active involvement of the French social services. Emile Louis, 66, who drove young people in social services' care between their foster homes and schools during the late Seventies, said he had sex with the women, to which they freely consented. He confessed he had felt 'uncontrollable urges' to murder his victims, aged between 16 and 29. Louis told police he buried all seven bodies on the banks of the River Serein in Rouvray, near Auxerre. So far only one female skeleton has been found and it has yet to be identified. Louis cannot be convicted for the killings because under French law a suspect cannot be charged with murder more than 10 years after the crimes. Families of the victims have called for the time period of 10 years to start from the date when the bodies are found. Louis is being held for kidnapping, for which there is no statute of limitations. But, if the bodies are found and identified, Louis could be freed, since he cannot be charged with their murder. The case of the disparues has shocked France and left many questions unanswered. How could seven young women, several of whom had no living natural parents, simply disappear without the affair causing a national scandal at the time? Why did police investigators fail to spot the links between the disappearances, when several women lived with foster families in the same small village and four went to the same school in Auxerre? Why did they and the social services think each girl was a runaway? How could Louis, who has served jail terms for sexual offences, not have been charged with their murders? But Louis's case may just be the tip of the iceberg in a region coming under intense scrutiny for its police and judicial incompetence as well as for the dubious management of its homes for handicapped children. In another case, a 19-year-old girl called Huguette was found wandering the streets of Auxerre in January 1984. She told police she had been chained up for nearly three months in a cellar under a house in a nearby village. She claimed to have been tortured and raped, and told police that another girl was still there. Police officers found Michaela, 22, in the cellar, naked and suspended from a ladder by her wrists. The owners of the house, Claude and Monique Dunand, had placed small ads in local papers and at employment agencies to recruit girls to look after 'an ageing, sick aunt'. From the applicants, Claude Dunand always chose handicapped girls in the care of the local social services. Over 15 years, he locked girls in the cellar of the house, fed them dog food and then invited guests round to torture and kill his victims. 'He had a slate,' said his lawyer, Jean-Yves Linard, 'on which he would write in chalk the day's menu, how much to burn their breasts and so on.' Dunand was jailed for life in 1991 for rape, kidnapping, sexual assault and torture, and his wife jailed for two years. But no bodies have been found, nor have any of Dunand's clients been traced. 'We always had the impression that there was another party, and that there were bodies that hadn't been found,' said Linard. 'It was absolutely impossible, when one saw the state of the two young girls who escaped at the edge of death, to imagine that there were not others. But where they are is an absolute mystery.' In a third case in Auxerre, the general secretary of an association for handicapped adults and children (APJH), Pierre Charrier, was jailed for six years for rape in 1992. During his trial it emerged that for more than a year he had raped a 23-year-old mentally handicapped woman in the back of his car each week after choir practice while a boy stood guard. Charrier's wife, Nicole, still runs an APJH home near Auxerre. Charrier and Emile Louis, who is now one of France's most notorious serial killers, were friends during the Seventies and Eighties.

But Djukanovic says Montenegro cannot remain a 'hostage' to Kosovo.</p> <p>The most serious impediment to negotiating a common future, within a new federation or outside, is the imbalance between the two republics. Serbia has a population of eight million, while Montenegro's is 650,000. Negotiating an equal status for both is going to be difficult and, as far as Serbia's new leaders may be concerned, ultimately not worth the bother.</p> <p>The most recent polls show that just over half of Montenegro's citizens are in favour of independence, but analysts expect this to rise to at least 60 per cent during the referendum campaign.</p> <p>\u0095 Tim Judah is the author of 'The Serbs: History, Myth and the Destruction of Yugoslavia'</p>",

Yugoslavia currently consists of Serbia (including Kosovo) and Montenegro. It was remodelled in 1992 by Slobodan Milosevic, the former Serbian and Yugoslav leader, after the collapse of the old six-republic Yugoslavia. But since 1997 Montenegro has been independent in all but name. After crisis talks in the Montenegrin capital of Podgorica last week, two parties in the governing coalition endorsed an independence plan on Thursday night, while a third, minor coalition party opposed to independence walked out of the government. The independence 'platform' must be endorsed by parliament, but if the government cannot muster enough votes a general election will be called. Montenegrin government sources believe that, with the votes of hardline pro-independence deputies from the Liberal Party, the 'platform' will be approved and the need for new elections avoided. Until the fall of Milosevic last October, many Montenegrins and foreign analysts feared that moves towards independence would be met by a Belgrade-inspired coup in Podgorica, or even a civil war. Those fears have now evaporated. Last week the Montenegrin President, Milo Djukanovic, went to Belgrade for the first time since 1998. He demanded, and received, the sacking of top Yugoslav military officials in the republic, plus the disbandment of the much-feared pro-Serbian 7th Battalion. This will not be enough, however, to dampen the Montenegrin government's demand for independence. In an interview, Djukanovic told The Observer that he saw Montenegro 'with renewed statehood and internationally recognised'. In the next two weeks Serbia will constitute its new government, which must then sit down with the Montenegrins to negotiate. Djukanovic is offering Serbia a deal - he wants international recognition for both republics, which would then form a 'union' or 'alliance'. This would pool resources for defence, foreign policy and operate a common market. Zoran Djindjic, soon to be confirmed as Serbia's new Prime Minister, agrees that constitutional changes need to be made, but disagrees that the end result should be two new, independent states. For one thing, he says, if Montenegro becomes independent, then Serbia would most probably lose its claim to restore its sovereignty to Kosovo. But Djukanovic says Montenegro cannot remain a 'hostage' to Kosovo. The most serious impediment to negotiating a common future, within a new federation or outside, is the imbalance between the two republics. Serbia has a population of eight million, while Montenegro's is 650,000. Negotiating an equal status for both is going to be difficult and, as far as Serbia's new leaders may be concerned, ultimately not worth the bother. The most recent polls show that just over half of Montenegro's citizens are in favour of independence, but analysts expect this to rise to at least 60 per cent during the referendum campaign. \u0095 Tim Judah is the author of 'The Serbs: History, Myth and the Destruction of Yugoslavia'",

      "bodyText": "KwaZulu Natal is a land sacred to Zulus and Afrikaners alike. But it is being destroyed by a culture of corruption, with one of its top policemen accused of being its leading gangster. Piet Meyer, the suspended head of the province's organised crime unit, has been charged with running a protection syndicate involved in drugs and vice, and having a lifestyle more suited to that of a Colombian kingpin than of the notoriously low-paid South African police. Meyer denies the charges, but will face trial in March - as long as the prosecution witnesses are still around. Lawyers have already complained of intimidation, but they were too late to save police officer Eric Tussie. A star witness against Meyer, he was shot dead outside a Durban nightclub. Meyer's case is the tip of the iceberg in KwaZulu Natal, a province formed after the 1994 all-race elections by merging the old Zulu homelands with the National Party stronghold of Natal. Racked by corruption and dissent, the province's police force has become a byword for corruption, fuelling South Africa's crime wave rather than fighting it. Several senior officers from the Durban North station were charged with gross misconduct this year after they allowed drug-dealers awaiting trial to bring telephones, televisions, drinks and weightlifting equipment into the cells. Conditions in the station were described as being like those of a luxury hotel - all-night orgies, attended by police and criminals, were common. One suspect in a fraud case was allowed to escape by walking out of the front door. Another Durban police station, at Chatsworth, is even more notorious. Policemen stationed there masterminded South Africa's biggest armed robbery that netted more than \u00a33 million. More than half the station's officers have been investigated for criminal activities, a quarter of its guns are unaccounted for and evidence in murder cases was being sold for \u00a3100. The situation got so bad that one local community group labelled the station as 'the major source of crime in Chatsworth - if not Durban'. The problem with the police is only a symptom of a wider disease of corruption in the province, famed for its battlefields as first Afrikaner settlers and then the British fought with the Zulus. 'The problems with the police have got a lot of attention, but the real root cause of it is a culture of corruption that is deeper here than elsewhere in South Africa,' said Professor Tom Lodge, a political scientist at the University of the Witwatersrand. The problem stems from the bloody conflicts that raged across the province during apartheid. The white-run state used its policemen as a political tool to crush black activists, running dirty tricks campaigns and murdering opposition leaders. Fighting crime was low on the list of priorities and transforming into an effective police force has been difficult for 'old school' officers. But Zulu nationalism has also played a role, during an appalling turf war between the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the African National Congress that cost about 10,000 lives in the decade up to 1994. The violence bred a culture of warlordism and gangsterism that is still widespread in the villages and teeming townships that surround most large towns. Some efforts have been made to clean up the province. At Chatsworth, scores of officers were transferred from the station in a successful bid to break up the crime rings operating there.

After so much bloodshed there is an uneasy peace in the province. 'To some extent corruption is the price you pay for stability. The ANC has adopted a \"don't rock the boat\" strategy there,' Lodge said.",

      "body": "<p>So that was that. Another Christmas. I did what most of us do and observed the Christmas rituals, from last-minute present buying to the Christmas Day turkey. I sang carols and tried to relate to the spirituality of the Christmas narrative. But each year it gets harder - the material excess of Christmas is dwarfing its spiritual content.</p> <p>This year more than any other, I wondered whether Christmas as it exists will survive the twenty-first century. Maybe Christmas Day 2100 will be just like Christmas Day 2000, but I doubt it. There is an emerging crisis of faith which makes it harder and harder for the story of Jesus's birth to bear the load of these 10 days of holiday and celebration.</p> <p>There is little to be gained by deploring this state of affairs as but more evidence of our irreligious and immoral society; even if there were a simple linkage between religion and morality, it would not matter because you can't force faith upon disbelievers and sceptics. Nor, I think, does the argument that religion is crucial to underpinning morality really stand up. We are perfectly capable of creating the moral contracts that sustain a just society without believing in, say, damnation.</p> <p>Equality before the law; a free press; the presumption of innocence until proof of guilt; the need to provide a floor under the living conditions of the poor; the need to talk to our children, as Mary Warnock argued powerfully in these pages last week, to give them moral sensibilities - all are instincts that spring from our basic humanity and do not need to be underpinned by a belief in God. Secularity of itself is not immoral; it is perfectly consistent with a wide range of moral approaches and outcomes.</p> <p>In any case, our state of growing disbelief cannot be turned around by rational appeals to have faith because this would be good for morality. At the moment, most of us inhabit a religious halfway house, hardly full-blown believers but reluctant to abandon Christian teachings and moral fables and whole heartedly to embrace the universe of agnosticism and atheism.</p> <p>We recognise that Christianity's moral precepts are valuable in themselves even if we hesitate to embrace notions of Heaven, Hell and the afterlife. But while we find it hard positively to believe in God, we equally find it difficult to go the whole hog and dismiss the entire exercise as a charade. And even if we want to, the Anglican Church's own limitless tolerance and kindness make it hard to declare independence from religion. Who would want to raise a blow against a body of such good people?</p> <p>But this is hardly a stable, steady-state condition. Our children are even less willing to occupy this halfway house than we are; their drift to agnosticism is obvious to all. Institutions, like relationships, need momentum; they must have vitality or they wither and die. For those who have dedicated themselves to a life of faith, working in the established church, the current situation is hardly satisfactory. There is no point for them in working in a lifeless mausoleum, effectively as no more than custodians of a relic that we value culturally but will not and cannot offer the faith to reanimate. Unless they can spread faith to others, they are not discharging their obligation to their God, their vocation and themselves.</p> <p>I am sure that the movement inside the Church of England to break the ties with the state will grow; disestablishment offers it the chance to become a campaigning missionary and a real agent, as it will see itself, of rechristianising Britain. The status quo offers it a gentle decline, overwhelmed by secularism and scepticism which it will not be as free to contest as it needs to be if it remains custodian of the official religion.

      "bodyText": "So that was that. Another Christmas. I did what most of us do and observed the Christmas rituals, from last-minute present buying to the Christmas Day turkey. I sang carols and tried to relate to the spirituality of the Christmas narrative. But each year it gets harder - the material excess of Christmas is dwarfing its spiritual content. This year more than any other, I wondered whether Christmas as it exists will survive the twenty-first century. Maybe Christmas Day 2100 will be just like Christmas Day 2000, but I doubt it. There is an emerging crisis of faith which makes it harder and harder for the story of Jesus's birth to bear the load of these 10 days of holiday and celebration. There is little to be gained by deploring this state of affairs as but more evidence of our irreligious and immoral society; even if there were a simple linkage between religion and morality, it would not matter because you can't force faith upon disbelievers and sceptics. Nor, I think, does the argument that religion is crucial to underpinning morality really stand up. We are perfectly capable of creating the moral contracts that sustain a just society without believing in, say, damnation. Equality before the law; a free press; the presumption of innocence until proof of guilt; the need to provide a floor under the living conditions of the poor; the need to talk to our children, as Mary Warnock argued powerfully in these pages last week, to give them moral sensibilities - all are instincts that spring from our basic humanity and do not need to be underpinned by a belief in God. Secularity of itself is not immoral; it is perfectly consistent with a wide range of moral approaches and outcomes. In any case, our state of growing disbelief cannot be turned around by rational appeals to have faith because this would be good for morality. At the moment, most of us inhabit a religious halfway house, hardly full-blown believers but reluctant to abandon Christian teachings and moral fables and whole heartedly to embrace the universe of agnosticism and atheism. We recognise that Christianity's moral precepts are valuable in themselves even if we hesitate to embrace notions of Heaven, Hell and the afterlife. But while we find it hard positively to believe in God, we equally find it difficult to go the whole hog and dismiss the entire exercise as a charade. And even if we want to, the Anglican Church's own limitless tolerance and kindness make it hard to declare independence from religion. Who would want to raise a blow against a body of such good people? But this is hardly a stable, steady-state condition. Our children are even less willing to occupy this halfway house than we are; their drift to agnosticism is obvious to all. Institutions, like relationships, need momentum; they must have vitality or they wither and die. For those who have dedicated themselves to a life of faith, working in the established church, the current situation is hardly satisfactory. There is no point for them in working in a lifeless mausoleum, effectively as no more than custodians of a relic that we value culturally but will not and cannot offer the faith to reanimate. Unless they can spread faith to others, they are not discharging their obligation to their God, their vocation and themselves. I am sure that the movement inside the Church of England to break the ties with the state will grow; disestablishment offers it the chance to become a campaigning missionary and a real agent, as it will see itself, of rechristianising Britain. The status quo offers it a gentle decline, overwhelmed by secularism and scepticism which it will not be as free to contest as it needs to be if it remains custodian of the official religion. That condition forces it into too many compromises. Thus it was no accident that on Christmas Eve the Archbishop of Canterbury opened up the question of disestablishment, acknowledging there was a 'real argument' to be had, at the same time as the Church of England prepared to join the other faith communities in the 'Faith Works' campaign in the run-up to the next election. The Church of England knows it must associate itself vigorously with other religions insisting on the importance of faith to stay alive as an institution; if that means opposing or criticising the Government, so be it. And if this in turn leads to disestablishment - better that than a slow death. This is where politics in general, and New Labour's temporisations in particular, enter the frame. The Government will want this issue, like drugs or republicanism, simply to go away. The Tories will criticise any move towards disestablishment as a weakening of a crucial part of our cultural and constitutional identity and they will argue that an avowedly Christian society should not reduce its religion to the same moral worth as other religions in a multi-cultural, multi-faith society. And because New Labour will not want to be seen as soft on British identity or the moral worth of Christianity, on past performance it will retreat to the Conservative position of trying to preserve the status quo, while sustaining order by a mixture of repressive social legislation, assistance to the working poor to improve themselves and moral hectoring. Tactically, this is a perfectly tenable position. If the Church of England itself takes the lead, then New Labour can always climb down gracefully in response to pressure from below, without its own conservatism being compromised. But if this is how the debate plays out, as seems all too likely, it will be both an abdication of political leadership and another example of how a crucial tradition in democratic life - that of the liberal and reformist centre-Left - now has no presence in British political debate. New Labour's positioning as an essentially liberal conservative party, forcing the Right to the extreme margins and the liberal Left into a conservative straitjacket, may be clever short-term politics but in the medium term it robs the country of one of its most important assets, the capacity to debate and talk to itself. This is the greater moral threat than the advance of secularism or the decline of faith. The march of science and rationalism that undermines the capacity to believe in God and the afterlife cannot be undone.

      "body": "<p>Passing through the Damascus Gate into Jerusalem's Old City you enter the Arab Quarter, a place of narrow, shady lanes, tiny shops and cramped coffee houses where elderly men sit smoking hookahs. It is, by any reckoning, a quintessentially Palestinian space. Save, that is, for a house a few hundred metres from the gate built in an arch that spans the street. From it hangs a giant Israeli flag. It is the residence in the Old City of Ariel Sharon: right-wing Likud leader; Israeli war hero; zionist hawk, and declared enemy of both the Oslo peace process and the putative Palestinian state.</p> <p>Sharon's House, as it is is known, is a bit of a misnomer. He keeps it to make a point: that even in the heart of Arab Jerusalem, Jews still stake a claim. But then Sharon has always been keen on provocations. His house in the the Old City is one. His visit in September to Islam's third holiest shrine, the nearby compound of Haram al-Sharif - the trigger for three months of bloodshed - was another.</p> <p>The question now is whether he is prosecuting the greatest provocation in his long career: running for Israel's highest political office on 6 February for no other reason than finally to torpedo the Oslo peace process. For Sharon has made it clear that he considers the emerging US-brokered peace deal that would create a definitive Palestinian state, to be dangerous and illegitimate. He says he would not feel bound to honour it if he is elected.</p> <p>It is more than a moot point. On Friday an opinion poll in the weekly Maariv put Sharon ahead of his rival in the prime ministerial elections, the incumbent Labour leader Ehud Barak, by a margin of almost two to one. A second poll in the daily Yediot Aharanot put Sharon 13 points ahead, but the reasons for his sudden popularity are not hard to fathom.</p> <p>Sharon's support has been galvanized by reports of concessions on offer to the Palestinian side by Prime Minister Barak in the present round of negotiations including de facto sovereignty over Haram al Sharif, revered by Jews as the site of the Biblical Second Temple; the surrender of large areas of Occupied Arab East Jerusalem, and the abandonment of all but a handful of the settlements in the Occupied Territories.</p> <p>By the same measure, support for Barak has been devastated. For supporters of the peace process there is a sense of deja vu. Like his Likud rival Binjamin Netanyahu in the 1996 election when he defeated Shimon Peres - Sharon is also riding high on the public outrage that has followed a wave of recent terrorist attacks, including last week's bus bomb in Tel Aviv.</p> <p>Suddenly it seems that Sharon's boldest and most dangerous gamble may be about to hit pay dirt. After being sidelined from the highest offices of army and state for four decades, the bloodshed of the Al Aqsa intifada has brought the prize he has pursued for a lifetime almost within his grasp. The three months since his visit to Haram al-Sharif have been momentous ones for Sharon, a burly man of 72, still fighting friends and foes alike at an age when most would be contemplating retirement rather than planning to lead a country which his election would inevitably tip into faster escalating crisis.</p> <p>While Sharon has denied that his visit to Haram al-Sharif was intended to trigger the violence of the intifada that followed, his timing could not have been better, tapping into a widespread anti-peace sentiment among Israeli settlers and others on Israel's Right that escalated following the break-up of the Camp David talks. Conveniently it also catapulted him into the headlines on the very day that graft charges against his main rival for the leadership of Likud, Netanyahu, were dropped.</p> <p>Strong-willed, brilliant and ambitious, the name of Ariel Sharon peppers Israel's short, half-century of history like gunshot. From the questionable but brilliant Gaza and Kinneret raids which he led against Egyptian and Syrian positions in the 1950s, through Suez (where he was criticised for leading his paratroopers into an ambush by disobeying orders), to the massacre of civilians at the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps in Lebanon, an atrocity in which he was implicated, the figure of 'bulldozer Ariel' has loomed large.</p> <p>Politically too he has attached himself to the most incendiary of causes. He encouraged the land grab of the settlement builders, called for the liquidation of the first Palestinian 'intifada' of 1987-1993, and suggested the effective imprisonment of the Palestinian population within walled pockets. All the while he has thumbed his nose at American-led interventions to cement a permanent peace process. So it was, perhaps, inevitable that at the moment of the Middle East Peace Process's greatest crisis, it should have been Sharon who provided the casus belli.</p> <p>Born in 1928 into a family of eastern European refugees named Scheinerman in Kfar Malal, one of the first agricultural settlements in Palestine in the Sharon valley not far from Tel Aviv, his first taste of trouble came with membership of Gadna, a paramilitary youth battalion, prior to joining Hagganah, the underground Jewish Defence Force defending settlers against Arab attacks.</p> <p>It was this early experience of Jewish communities under threat that coloured his whole outlook. After independence in 1948 he led commando units that specialised in behind-the-lines raids forcing Palestinians to flee their homes, encouraging - critics say - as many terrorist attacks as he prevented.</p> <p>This explains why Palestinians, Arabs and left-wing Israelis hate him, and why so many Israelis of the Right adore him. To them Sharon is the epitome of the tough Jew, represented in the image of the 13-year-old Sharon being given a dagger by his father to protect his family. Sharon recalls: 'The knife was symbolic, to protect ourselves from our enemies. It was a lesson I have never forgotten.'</p> <p>But his policy of striking first and hardest - summed up in his motto 'always escalate' - has also been responsible for his worst disasters. His belief in pre-emptive defence led to the disastrous invasion of South Lebanon in 1982 - Israel's first war of choice. His adherence to a strategy of pre-emptive action has not been confined to the battlefield. He sued Time magazine for libel, ostensibly to clear his name in the Sabra-Shatilla affair. Cynics, however, believe the real purpose of the attack was to relaunch his political career.</p> <p>His approach to the Occupied Territories and his encouragement of Jewish settlement is similarly coloured. 'Grab more hills,' he has insisted. 'Whatever is seized will be ours. Whatever isn't seized will end up in their hands.'</p> <p>It is a policy that he assiduously enacted as Housing Minister from 1990-1992 when he presided over the biggest construction drive in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since Israel captured the lands in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. But for all of Sharon's frightening and erratic brilliance as a short-term strategist, his personal tragedy is of forever being the 'nearly-man', who promised everything but always snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.</p> <p>His flair for improvisation as a soldier - most famously in leading the counter-attack against the Egyptians in the 1973 Yom Kippur war - won him as many enemies as admirers, blocking his route to the most senior positions in Israel's armed forces. In his political career, too, he has been similarly thwarted.</p> <p>The commission of inquiry into the massacres at Sabra and Shatilla when he was Minister for Defence, while clearing him of direct responsibility, held him responsible for not halting the bloodshed. Since then he has struggled to rebuild his political career launched in 1973 when he was instrumental in the founding of the Likud party.</p> <p>But even within Likud, Sharon's style has created obstacles for his advancement, not least in his rivalries within the party with the likes of Netanyahu and Yitzak Shamir. This time, however, Ariel is playing for keeps. Old age may not have softened the 'bulldozer', but he has shown in recent months that he has learned to play a rather longer and more cunning game keeping Barak guessing over whether he would join an emergency government of national unity while undermining his position.</p> <p>He is also not above some cynical PR. Last week he sent Yasser Arafat - a man whom he said he would never shake hands with - a card to mark the Muslim feast of Eid al Fitr in which he expressed his hope that the two peoples could live in 'peace together'. Perhaps, it is not as cynical as it appears. This is the man, after all, who surprised observers in 1997 by declaring that like the hawkish Menachem Begin before him who made peace with the Egyptians, he was the only person could deliver peace. 'You just haven't known it,' Sharon declared. 'I'm the only person who can successfully negotiate a peace agreement with the Palestinians.'</p> <p>He may believe it.

      "bodyText": "Passing through the Damascus Gate into Jerusalem's Old City you enter the Arab Quarter, a place of narrow, shady lanes, tiny shops and cramped coffee houses where elderly men sit smoking hookahs. It is, by any reckoning, a quintessentially Palestinian space. Save, that is, for a house a few hundred metres from the gate built in an arch that spans the street. From it hangs a giant Israeli flag. It is the residence in the Old City of Ariel Sharon: right-wing Likud leader; Israeli war hero; zionist hawk, and declared enemy of both the Oslo peace process and the putative Palestinian state. Sharon's House, as it is is known, is a bit of a misnomer. He keeps it to make a point: that even in the heart of Arab Jerusalem, Jews still stake a claim. But then Sharon has always been keen on provocations. His house in the the Old City is one. His visit in September to Islam's third holiest shrine, the nearby compound of Haram al-Sharif - the trigger for three months of bloodshed - was another. The question now is whether he is prosecuting the greatest provocation in his long career: running for Israel's highest political office on 6 February for no other reason than finally to torpedo the Oslo peace process. For Sharon has made it clear that he considers the emerging US-brokered peace deal that would create a definitive Palestinian state, to be dangerous and illegitimate. He says he would not feel bound to honour it if he is elected. It is more than a moot point. On Friday an opinion poll in the weekly Maariv put Sharon ahead of his rival in the prime ministerial elections, the incumbent Labour leader Ehud Barak, by a margin of almost two to one. A second poll in the daily Yediot Aharanot put Sharon 13 points ahead, but the reasons for his sudden popularity are not hard to fathom. Sharon's support has been galvanized by reports of concessions on offer to the Palestinian side by Prime Minister Barak in the present round of negotiations including de facto sovereignty over Haram al Sharif, revered by Jews as the site of the Biblical Second Temple; the surrender of large areas of Occupied Arab East Jerusalem, and the abandonment of all but a handful of the settlements in the Occupied Territories. By the same measure, support for Barak has been devastated. For supporters of the peace process there is a sense of deja vu. Like his Likud rival Binjamin Netanyahu in the 1996 election when he defeated Shimon Peres - Sharon is also riding high on the public outrage that has followed a wave of recent terrorist attacks, including last week's bus bomb in Tel Aviv. Suddenly it seems that Sharon's boldest and most dangerous gamble may be about to hit pay dirt. After being sidelined from the highest offices of army and state for four decades, the bloodshed of the Al Aqsa intifada has brought the prize he has pursued for a lifetime almost within his grasp. The three months since his visit to Haram al-Sharif have been momentous ones for Sharon, a burly man of 72, still fighting friends and foes alike at an age when most would be contemplating retirement rather than planning to lead a country which his election would inevitably tip into faster escalating crisis. While Sharon has denied that his visit to Haram al-Sharif was intended to trigger the violence of the intifada that followed, his timing could not have been better, tapping into a widespread anti-peace sentiment among Israeli settlers and others on Israel's Right that escalated following the break-up of the Camp David talks. Conveniently it also catapulted him into the headlines on the very day that graft charges against his main rival for the leadership of Likud, Netanyahu, were dropped. Strong-willed, brilliant and ambitious, the name of Ariel Sharon peppers Israel's short, half-century of history like gunshot. From the questionable but brilliant Gaza and Kinneret raids which he led against Egyptian and Syrian positions in the 1950s, through Suez (where he was criticised for leading his paratroopers into an ambush by disobeying orders), to the massacre of civilians at the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps in Lebanon, an atrocity in which he was implicated, the figure of 'bulldozer Ariel' has loomed large.

All the while he has thumbed his nose at American-led interventions to cement a permanent peace process. So it was, perhaps, inevitable that at the moment of the Middle East Peace Process's greatest crisis, it should have been Sharon who provided the casus belli. Born in 1928 into a family of eastern European refugees named Scheinerman in Kfar Malal, one of the first agricultural settlements in Palestine in the Sharon valley not far from Tel Aviv, his first taste of trouble came with membership of Gadna, a paramilitary youth battalion, prior to joining Hagganah, the underground Jewish Defence Force defending settlers against Arab attacks. It was this early experience of Jewish communities under threat that coloured his whole outlook. After independence in 1948 he led commando units that specialised in behind-the-lines raids forcing Palestinians to flee their homes, encouraging - critics say - as many terrorist attacks as he prevented. This explains why Palestinians, Arabs and left-wing Israelis hate him, and why so many Israelis of the Right adore him.

      "body": "<p><strong>JULY</strong> </p> <p>We dreamed of someone to watch over us. After 50 years of pressure, it was announced that the Government would pay compensation to the few remaining survivors of Japanese prisoner-of-war camps; each man would get in the region of \u00a310,000. Channel 4's compulsive piece of guinea piggery, Big Brother, selected 10 people from 40,000 applicants to exist for two months in an enclosed compound under the constant gaze of 25 television cameras. The incentives to survival were \u00a370,000 and the twenty-first-century equivalent of 15 minutes of fame: ubiquitous tabloid and television exposure for months on end; glossy magazines competing for pictures of your kitchen units. The group shared varying degrees of paranoia and charmlessness, prompting a new version of the prisoner's dilemma: the problem lay not in deciding who to vote out, but rather who on earth could possibly stay in. </p> <p>The inspectors of IRA arsenals, the former ANC leader Cyril Ramaphosa, and Martti Ahtisaari, former president of Finland, agreed with the IRA on a system of dual keys to the arms dumps, the latest in an unending series of 'major breakthroughs' in the peace process. It was claimed that the weapons would be put beyond use, but no one quite knew how or when. </p> <p>There was a sense of Groundhog Day at Drumcree, where the Orange Order march was blocked for the third year running. The RUC used water cannon to disperse protesters, who included the freed Ulster Freedom Fighters' leader, Johnny 'Mad Dog' Adair, forcing them 200 yards back up a hill towards the Church of Ascension. </p> <p>Eight-year-old Sarah Payne went missing in West Sussex, and her body was subsequently discovered in a field off the A29, which overnight became a vast shrine of flowers and teddy bears. News of the World editor, 31-year-old Rebekah Wade, anxious to make her mark with Rupert Murdoch, pledged herself to naming and shaming 110,000 paedophiles in Britain and encouraged her readers to 'scout out the beasts'. Within hours of the publication of the first 50 names, Ian Armstrong's house in Manchester was surrounded by a lynch mob of 300 people hurling bricks and abuse. Armstrong had been mistakenly identified as the sex offender Peter Smith, who, like him, wore a neck brace. He later appeared at a press conference supporting the campaign. </p> <p>Euan Blair, the 16-year-old son of the Prime Minister, was found drunk and disorderly, vomiting in Leicester Square after finishing his GCSEs at the London Oratory School. Addressing the Faith in the Future conference of black evangelical Christians the following day, his father quoted Henry Wadsworth Longfellow: 'For thine own purpose thou hast sent strife and discouragement.' Richard Williams, who had coached his daughters Venus and Serena out of a Los Angeles ghetto to victory at Wimbledon, danced on the roof of the commentary box on Centre Court, and held up a series of hand-made signs, including 'We love you, Duke and Duchess'. Tiger Woods, whose father predicted he would have more impact on the world than Gandhi, easily won the British Open at St Andrews. </p> <p>A week after it was reported that cracks had been found in the wings of 11 Concordes, one of Air France's fleet bound for New York's John F. Kennedy airport crashed near Charles de Gaulle airport, killing all 109 passengers as well as four people on the ground. Euro-dreams of supersonic travel seemed to to be part of the scattered wreckage. Later, a metal strip was found on the runway, believed to have fallen from a distinctly subsonic Continental DC-10; the piece of metal was suspected of puncturing one of the Concorde's high-pressure tyres, causing the accident. John Aspinall, the zookeeper and casino owner died, black-boxed with him, perhaps, the true story of the disappearance of Lord Lucan. </p> <p><strong>AUGUST</strong> </p> <p>The seven ages were being redefined. British scientists were granted the right to clone human embryos for the purposes of research. William Hague, keen to lose his 'Tory foetus' image, made extravagant claims about the extent to which he had been pickled in a former life; he was, he said, a 14 pints a night man. The Queen Mother turned 100, a credit to the preservative powers of malt whisky and champagne, and received a telegram from her daughter. Madonna revealed the limits to her love affair with Cool Britannia when she returned home to the States to have her baby, Rocco, believing British hospitals to be 'old and Victorian'. </p> <p>Chancellor Gordon Brown resisted the temptation of turning his wedding to PR girl Sarah Macaulay into a publicity stunt: Hello! and Alastair Campbell were not invited. The only nuptial budgetary leak suggested that the pair were toasted with \u00a311.99 socialist champagne from Sainsbury's. Anthea Turner and Grant Bovey, the diminutive darlings of daytime TV, seemed less concerned with the dignity of their union; a wedding photo of them eating his-and-hers Cadbury's Snowflake bars, given away as a promotion at their wedding, was released to the Sun by OK! Turner, whose all-too-candid autobiography, Fools Rush In, was being readied for publication, was said to be distraught at this 'betrayal of trust', and anyway, she pointed out: 'Grant doesn't even like chocolate. He's far too vain ...' </p> <p>No one, it seemed, could keep a confidence. David Shayler, who publicly detailed bungled MI5 operations, returned to Britain facing a six-year sentence for breaking the Official Secrets Act. Dame Stella Rimington, his former spy chief, announced that she, too, would be writing her memoirs. Nasty Nick Bateman became public enemy number one, when his Machiavellian approach to Big Brother was rumbled: 'You've made me look a c- in front of everyone,' he claimed to his nemesis, the Scouser Craig, the reality of reality TV striking him as if for the first time. </p> <p>There were voyeuristic variants of the show-topping ratings elsewhere in the world. In Holland, 11 people shared an 18-foot bed on the top deck of a bus. The show attracted 6,000 would-be fare dodgers prepared to submit themselves to 24-hour live coverage of a not very magical mystery tour. The Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, pride of the Baltic fleet, sank with all hands after a missile exploded in a torpedo tube. There was brief hope that those trapped inside might be rescued, but a British team, with the latest mini-sub technology, was called in too late by Vladimir Putin to attempt to save the doomed crew. </p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer launched a rare TV advertising campaign to appeal to the 'fuller-figured woman', many more of whom they hoped would be squeezing themselves into their fitting-rooms. The ads showed a naked, size-16 woman clambering to the top of a hill in order to tell the world: 'I'm normal'. Simon Russell Beale's inspired and rotund Hamlet came to the National Theatre and re-examined our stereotypes of tortured leading men: 'Tubby or not tubby, fat is the question,' suggested one headline. The Polar icecap thawed, melted and resolved itself into a dew for the first time in 50 million years </p> <p><strong>SEPTEMBER</strong></p> <p>We seemed a nation in gridlock. Brynle Williams, a sheep farmer from Wales, and a raggedy army of farmers and road hauliers brought Britain to a standstill in a demonstration of word-of-mouth solidarity against fuel duties. Lorries blocked motorways; there were lightning raids on refineries and depots, and the just-in-time supply policies of supermarkets and retailers were exposed.</p> <p>The tortured relationship at the heart of government between Chancellor and Prime Minister, revealed in a book by The Observer's Andrew Rawnsley, came under its strongest pressure yet: 'It's like a marriage, a tempestuous marriage,' noted one insider. 'The rows can be terrible... but you come between them at your peril.' The British Physiological Society discovered that grown men cry more readily than women. </p> <p>Conjoined twins Jodie and Mary were ordered to be separated by the appeal court against the wishes of their parents. 'Do we murder Mary to save Jodie?' asked Lord Justice Ward, setting in motion a national moral tug-of-war over the fate of the two girls. A magazine devoted to the possibilities of life after divorce was launched called New Era. Noel Gallagher split from his wife Meg Mathews, suggesting that he would rather stay in with daughter Anais in their Buckinghamshire home than go partying. Paula Yates, the former wife of Bob Geldof, was found dead in bed by her four-year-old daughter, Tiger Lily, after a heroin overdose. Her funeral service began with 'These boots were made for walking'. </p> <p>The Olympic spirit proved more stimulating than nandrolene in Sydney which, for a month, became a city of natural wonders: Ian 'Thorpedo' Thorpe's flipper-sized feet; Cathy Freeman's gap-toothed smile; the Brazilian women's beach volleyball team. Uniquely, the performance of Britain's athletes outweighed expectations: Denise Lewis heroically limped to victory, Jonathan Edwards finally hit the ground running and Audley Harrison, a heavyweight with a sociology degree, boxed clever. Steve Redgrave's pulling power was rewarded with a special commemorative pin from outgoing IOC president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, who had proved his commitment to the cause by returning to the games after attending his wife's funeral. No one wished they were in Manchester.</p> <p>Salman Rushdie announced to the world his intention to remove to New York because of the tyrannical 'bitchiness' he had encountered on this side of the Atlantic. Harold Pinter turned 70; fellow playwright Alan Bennett suggested that the occasion be marked with a minute's silence.</p> <p><strong>OCTOBER</strong></p> <p>Past crimes returned to haunt us. Reggie Kray bequeathed a posthumous pop song, accepting full responsibility for the murder of Jack 'the Hat' McVitie, and declaring love for his wife.The 16 volumes of official memos and undercover deals detailed in the Phillips Report on BSE revealed the extent of the former Conservative government's wilful misinformation and culpability in the beef crisis. The human strain of the disease vCJD claimed its eighty-second victim in Britain, Zoe Jeffries, 14, who, her crying mother explained, had been fond of burgers as a toddler. As BSE fears grew in France and Germany, some estimates suggested that the eventual death toll could be up to 130,000 people.</p> <p>At Hatfield, almost a year to the day after the Paddington disaster, four passengers died after a derailment caused by a piece of broken track that was due to have been replaced six months previously. Railtrack chief executive Gerald Corbett offered his resignation, and was initially refused; eventually, Corbett agreed to a \u00a3400,000 pay-off: \u00a320,000 for each mile of fatally neglected track.</p> <p>Hollywood discovered picket lines: Billy Elliot, a fable about a boy ballet dancer set against the 1984 miner's strike was a surprise box-office hit. Elizabeth Hurley, the unblemished face of Est\u00e9e Lauder, was labelled a scab by protesters from the Screen Actors' Guild at the premiere of her film, Bedazzled. Hurley marched past striking actors in Spandex trousers; later, as Variety magazine observed, she issued 'more mea culpas than a penitent at Lourdes'.</p> <p>England football manager Kevin Keegan talked himself out of a job he felt he had been pressured into accepting in the first place. After a defeat by Germany, and apparently plagued by a sense of tactical inadequacy, 'Mighty Mouse' explained that he felt 'a little bit short at this level'.</p> <p>At the much-hyped Apocalypse show at the Royal Academy, the enfants terrible of Britart, Jake and Dinos Chapman, unveiled a new vision of hell: thousands of mutant Airfix Nazis locked in frenzied civil war. Slobodan Milosevic, tinpot architect of ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, was voted from power in Serbia in an election he believed he couldn't lose. After sponsoring a decade of civil terror in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, Milosevic reluctantly relinquished control saying he wanted to spend more time with his family. Marko, his son, a racketeer and owner of the Belgrade theme park, Bambiland, promptly fled for Moscow, trailing corruption charges.</p> <p>Tolerance was hard to come by. Shadow Home Secretary Ann Widdecombe launched a wicked witch attack on soft drugs at the Conservative party conference, and found herself in danger of prosecuting seven dope-smoking colleagues. Concerned about teenage pregnancy rates, the Governnent unveiled an advertising campaign instructing young people to keep a grip on themselves: 'Sex: Are you thinking about it enough?' billboards inquired. In his first act as London Mayor, Ken Livingstone decided he would be taking no shit from Trafalgar Square's pigeons, and insisted that tourists cease feeding them.</p> <p>The Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded Gao Xingjian, a Chinese exile living on the nineteenth floor of a Paris towerblock. As a younger man, during the Cultural Revolution, he had been forced to burn 'kilos and kilos' of his own writing. The prize was like 'something that falls on you out of the blue sky,' he said. 'Like a miracle.'</p> <p><strong>NOVEMBER</strong></p> <p>A celebration of the work of England's greatest apocalyptic visionary, William Blake, opened at Tate Britain. The waters rose over our green and pleasant land, swamped by days and nights of rain. Geysers erupted on Salisbury Plain, impromptu ferry services sprang up in villages around York, and thousands were evacuated from sandbagged homes. The floods seemed further incontrovertible proof of global warming, and were accompanied by predictions from the Met Office that temperatures would increase by six degrees in this century, causing water levels to rise by seven metres, inundating every major coastal city in the world. </p> <p>At a conference on climate change in the Hague, Britain's chief negotiator, John Prescott, stormed out after failing to broker a deal on acceptable targets for carbon dioxide emissions between America's intransigent polluters and European environmentalists. Outside the conference, protesters declared that sparring delegates had 'sunk the world'.</p> <p>The new Jerusalem looked a distant prospect. On the West Bank, fighting had been intensifying for a month following the publication of graphic pictures of a 12-year-old Palestinian boy killed in the crossfire between Israeli troops and Arab protesters; one observer suggested that the conflict was 'like a PlayStation game: they have helmets and bulletproof vests but we Arabs have nothing'. Palestinians subsequently gained revenge in an attack on a police station in Ramallah where two Israeli soldiers were lynched, their attackers displaying bloody hands to the mob. Bill Clinton, anxious to seal the end of his presidency with a foreign policy coup intervened, unsuccessfully, for peace.</p> <p>The United States failed in its attempts to decide on a successor to Clinton. The race to the White House between Al Gore and George W. Bush rested on Florida's ballot, which was too close to call, and slowed to a crawl as American courts disagreed on the constitutional process of recounts. Russian President Vladimir Putin, straight-faced, wondered if he could offer Americans assistance in resolving its democratic difficulties.</p> <p>There were songs of innocence and experience. Elton John, in court suing his former manager for mishandling his financial affairs, admitted having once spent \u00a340m in a period of months, including \u00a3300,000 on cut flowers for his home. Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas blew a reported \u00a31.3m on their wedding celebrations at Donald Trump's Plaza Hotel in New York, including \u00a310,000 on a cake. Guests were invited to give cash rather than gifts; a seven-figure deal for exclusive rights to their nuptial photographs, signed with OK! magazine, was undermined by rival Hello! which published unofficial pictures; the happy couple sought an injunction.</p> <p>Proprietor of OK!, soft-porn baron Richard Desmond purchased Express Newspapers from the Labour peer Lord Hollick. Desmond had made his money from magazines such as Nude Readers Wives and Asian Babes. On arrival at the Express, Desmond reportedly 'enjoyed a celebratory drink' with editor Rosie Boycott, founder of Spare Rib.</p> <p>Chris Woodhead, controversial Chief Inspector of Schools, resigned his position in order to take up more lucrative educational work as a consultant to the Daily Telegraph and to Bell Pottinger, Margaret Thatcher's favourite PR firm. The Weakest Link, a quiz show loosely based on the notion that there is 'no such thing as society' moved to prime time on the BBC. Its host, Anne Robinson, employed the authentic rhetoric of the Ofsted inspectorate: 'You are the weakest link. Goodbye.' Judith Keppel, a distant cousin of Camilla Parker Bowles, was the first jackpot winner on ITV's Who Wants to be a Millionaire?; she had invested \u00a31,000 in phone calls to earn a place on the show.</p> <p><strong>DECEMBER</strong></p> <p>Satisfactory endings were in short supply. George W. Bush was granted the American presidency in the Supreme Court, which ruled that all votes in Florida should not, necessarily, count. Al Gore, who had won the popular vote, and who, as later unofficial recounts seemed to prove, also won in Florida, accepted his curious fate as the President Who Never Was. Bush, smiling his father's thin smile, surrounded himself with his old man's jowly cronies, and wondered what to do next. </p> <p>Richard Branson lost the chance to run the People's Lottery - and more priceless personal branding as a beneficient billionaire - and retired to his private island to contemplate might-have-beens. Tony Blair suggested that perhaps, in hindsight, the Dome had not been quite the 'runaway success' he'd predicted, though he did not ever actually set foot in the 'Blame Zone'. The highlight of the Millennium Experience was generally agreed have been the failed heist in November, in which a team of theme-park jewel thieves launched an attempt to steal a Diamond as Big as the Faith Zone, foiled by police thinly disguised as cleaners and eager tourists. </p> <p>Damilola Taylor, a 10-year-old Nigerian boy, ended his life bleeding to death in a stairwell in Peckham. All-seeing, impassive CCTV cameras caught him on his way to a library, eyes bright, just before he was stabbed to death. William Hague, denying he was playing a race card, chose the moment of the initial arrest of a gang of black youths in connection with the murder, to launch an odd attack on the MacPherson Report into the Stephen Lawrence case. Police, he suggested, lived in mortal fear these days of being branded racist by Polly Toynbee. </p> <p>Neil Hamilton, now apparently a junkie for public humiliation, saw his libel appeal against Mohamed al Fayed collapse and faced bankruptcy. Bilal Mohammed, from Birmingham, who, at 18, claimed he had seen the Prophet in a dream, launched a suicide bomb attack on an Indian barracks in Srinigar, killing himself and eight others.</p> <p>And a few fairytales came true. England won at cricket; Prince William was cleaning lavatories in Chile; Gordon Brown agreed to wipe out the debt owed to Britain by the world's 41 poorest countries; two men in a boat were plucked from the waves near Rhum; Harry Potter was on the cover of Radio Times; and despite the efforts of one photographer who lay overnight in the undergrowth at Skibo Castle to escape detection by thermal imaging devices, and another who hid for 60 hours in the organ-casing at Dornoch Cathedral with two bin bags to collect bodily waste, Madonna and Guy Ritchie proved, just about, that private lives still existed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "JULY We dreamed of someone to watch over us. After 50 years of pressure, it was announced that the Government would pay compensation to the few remaining survivors of Japanese prisoner-of-war camps; each man would get in the region of \u00a310,000. Channel 4's compulsive piece of guinea piggery, Big Brother, selected 10 people from 40,000 applicants to exist for two months in an enclosed compound under the constant gaze of 25 television cameras. The incentives to survival were \u00a370,000 and the twenty-first-century equivalent of 15 minutes of fame: ubiquitous tabloid and television exposure for months on end; glossy magazines competing for pictures of your kitchen units. The group shared varying degrees of paranoia and charmlessness, prompting a new version of the prisoner's dilemma: the problem lay not in deciding who to vote out, but rather who on earth could possibly stay in. The inspectors of IRA arsenals, the former ANC leader Cyril Ramaphosa, and Martti Ahtisaari, former president of Finland, agreed with the IRA on a system of dual keys to the arms dumps, the latest in an unending series of 'major breakthroughs' in the peace process. It was claimed that the weapons would be put beyond use, but no one quite knew how or when. There was a sense of Groundhog Day at Drumcree, where the Orange Order march was blocked for the third year running. The RUC used water cannon to disperse protesters, who included the freed Ulster Freedom Fighters' leader, Johnny 'Mad Dog' Adair, forcing them 200 yards back up a hill towards the Church of Ascension. Eight-year-old Sarah Payne went missing in West Sussex, and her body was subsequently discovered in a field off the A29, which overnight became a vast shrine of flowers and teddy bears. News of the World editor, 31-year-old Rebekah Wade, anxious to make her mark with Rupert Murdoch, pledged herself to naming and shaming 110,000 paedophiles in Britain and encouraged her readers to 'scout out the beasts'. Within hours of the publication of the first 50 names, Ian Armstrong's house in Manchester was surrounded by a lynch mob of 300 people hurling bricks and abuse. Armstrong had been mistakenly identified as the sex offender Peter Smith, who, like him, wore a neck brace. He later appeared at a press conference supporting the campaign. Euan Blair, the 16-year-old son of the Prime Minister, was found drunk and disorderly, vomiting in Leicester Square after finishing his GCSEs at the London Oratory School. Addressing the Faith in the Future conference of black evangelical Christians the following day, his father quoted Henry Wadsworth Longfellow: 'For thine own purpose thou hast sent strife and discouragement.' Richard Williams, who had coached his daughters Venus and Serena out of a Los Angeles ghetto to victory at Wimbledon, danced on the roof of the commentary box on Centre Court, and held up a series of hand-made signs, including 'We love you, Duke and Duchess'. Tiger Woods, whose father predicted he would have more impact on the world than Gandhi, easily won the British Open at St Andrews. A week after it was reported that cracks had been found in the wings of 11 Concordes, one of Air France's fleet bound for New York's John F. Kennedy airport crashed near Charles de Gaulle airport, killing all 109 passengers as well as four people on the ground. Euro-dreams of supersonic travel seemed to to be part of the scattered wreckage. Later, a metal strip was found on the runway, believed to have fallen from a distinctly subsonic Continental DC-10; the piece of metal was suspected of puncturing one of the Concorde's high-pressure tyres, causing the accident. John Aspinall, the zookeeper and casino owner died, black-boxed with him, perhaps, the true story of the disappearance of Lord Lucan. AUGUST The seven ages were being redefined. British scientists were granted the right to clone human embryos for the purposes of research. William Hague, keen to lose his 'Tory foetus' image, made extravagant claims about the extent to which he had been pickled in a former life; he was, he said, a 14 pints a night man. The Queen Mother turned 100, a credit to the preservative powers of malt whisky and champagne, and received a telegram from her daughter. Madonna revealed the limits to her love affair with Cool Britannia when she returned home to the States to have her baby, Rocco, believing British hospitals to be 'old and Victorian'. Chancellor Gordon Brown resisted the temptation of turning his wedding to PR girl Sarah Macaulay into a publicity stunt: Hello! and Alastair Campbell were not invited. The only nuptial budgetary leak suggested that the pair were toasted with \u00a311.99 socialist champagne from Sainsbury's. Anthea Turner and Grant Bovey, the diminutive darlings of daytime TV, seemed less concerned with the dignity of their union; a wedding photo of them eating his-and-hers Cadbury's Snowflake bars, given away as a promotion at their wedding, was released to the Sun by OK! Turner, whose all-too-candid autobiography, Fools Rush In, was being readied for publication, was said to be distraught at this 'betrayal of trust', and anyway, she pointed out: 'Grant doesn't even like chocolate. He's far too vain ...' No one, it seemed, could keep a confidence. David Shayler, who publicly detailed bungled MI5 operations, returned to Britain facing a six-year sentence for breaking the Official Secrets Act. Dame Stella Rimington, his former spy chief, announced that she, too, would be writing her memoirs. Nasty Nick Bateman became public enemy number one, when his Machiavellian approach to Big Brother was rumbled: 'You've made me look a c- in front of everyone,' he claimed to his nemesis, the Scouser Craig, the reality of reality TV striking him as if for the first time. There were voyeuristic variants of the show-topping ratings elsewhere in the world. In Holland, 11 people shared an 18-foot bed on the top deck of a bus. The show attracted 6,000 would-be fare dodgers prepared to submit themselves to 24-hour live coverage of a not very magical mystery tour. The Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, pride of the Baltic fleet, sank with all hands after a missile exploded in a torpedo tube. There was brief hope that those trapped inside might be rescued, but a British team, with the latest mini-sub technology, was called in too late by Vladimir Putin to attempt to save the doomed crew. Marks &amp; Spencer launched a rare TV advertising campaign to appeal to the 'fuller-figured woman', many more of whom they hoped would be squeezing themselves into their fitting-rooms. The ads showed a naked, size-16 woman clambering to the top of a hill in order to tell the world: 'I'm normal'. Simon Russell Beale's inspired and rotund Hamlet came to the National Theatre and re-examined our stereotypes of tortured leading men: 'Tubby or not tubby, fat is the question,' suggested one headline. The Polar icecap thawed, melted and resolved itself into a dew for the first time in 50 million years SEPTEMBER We seemed a nation in gridlock. Brynle Williams, a sheep farmer from Wales, and a raggedy army of farmers and road hauliers brought Britain to a standstill in a demonstration of word-of-mouth solidarity against fuel duties. Lorries blocked motorways; there were lightning raids on refineries and depots, and the just-in-time supply policies of supermarkets and retailers were exposed. The tortured relationship at the heart of government between Chancellor and Prime Minister, revealed in a book by The Observer's Andrew Rawnsley, came under its strongest pressure yet: 'It's like a marriage, a tempestuous marriage,' noted one insider. 'The rows can be terrible... but you come between them at your peril.' The British Physiological Society discovered that grown men cry more readily than women. Conjoined twins Jodie and Mary were ordered to be separated by the appeal court against the wishes of their parents. 'Do we murder Mary to save Jodie?' asked Lord Justice Ward, setting in motion a national moral tug-of-war over the fate of the two girls. A magazine devoted to the possibilities of life after divorce was launched called New Era. Noel Gallagher split from his wife Meg Mathews, suggesting that he would rather stay in with daughter Anais in their Buckinghamshire home than go partying. Paula Yates, the former wife of Bob Geldof, was found dead in bed by her four-year-old daughter, Tiger Lily, after a heroin overdose. Her funeral service began with 'These boots were made for walking'. The Olympic spirit proved more stimulating than nandrolene in Sydney which, for a month, became a city of natural wonders: Ian 'Thorpedo' Thorpe's flipper-sized feet; Cathy Freeman's gap-toothed smile; the Brazilian women's beach volleyball team. Uniquely, the performance of Britain's athletes outweighed expectations: Denise Lewis heroically limped to victory, Jonathan Edwards finally hit the ground running and Audley Harrison, a heavyweight with a sociology degree, boxed clever. Steve Redgrave's pulling power was rewarded with a special commemorative pin from outgoing IOC president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, who had proved his commitment to the cause by returning to the games after attending his wife's funeral. No one wished they were in Manchester. Salman Rushdie announced to the world his intention to remove to New York because of the tyrannical 'bitchiness' he had encountered on this side of the Atlantic. Harold Pinter turned 70; fellow playwright Alan Bennett suggested that the occasion be marked with a minute's silence. OCTOBER Past crimes returned to haunt us. Reggie Kray bequeathed a posthumous pop song, accepting full responsibility for the murder of Jack 'the Hat' McVitie, and declaring love for his wife.The 16 volumes of official memos and undercover deals detailed in the Phillips Report on BSE revealed the extent of the former Conservative government's wilful misinformation and culpability in the beef crisis. The human strain of the disease vCJD claimed its eighty-second victim in Britain, Zoe Jeffries, 14, who, her crying mother explained, had been fond of burgers as a toddler. As BSE fears grew in France and Germany, some estimates suggested that the eventual death toll could be up to 130,000 people. At Hatfield, almost a year to the day after the Paddington disaster, four passengers died after a derailment caused by a piece of broken track that was due to have been replaced six months previously. Railtrack chief executive Gerald Corbett offered his resignation, and was initially refused; eventually, Corbett agreed to a \u00a3400,000 pay-off: \u00a320,000 for each mile of fatally neglected track. Hollywood discovered picket lines: Billy Elliot, a fable about a boy ballet dancer set against the 1984 miner's strike was a surprise box-office hit. Elizabeth Hurley, the unblemished face of Est\u00e9e Lauder, was labelled a scab by protesters from the Screen Actors' Guild at the premiere of her film, Bedazzled. Hurley marched past striking actors in Spandex trousers; later, as Variety magazine observed, she issued 'more mea culpas than a penitent at Lourdes'. England football manager Kevin Keegan talked himself out of a job he felt he had been pressured into accepting in the first place. After a defeat by Germany, and apparently plagued by a sense of tactical inadequacy, 'Mighty Mouse' explained that he felt 'a little bit short at this level'. At the much-hyped Apocalypse show at the Royal Academy, the enfants terrible of Britart, Jake and Dinos Chapman, unveiled a new vision of hell: thousands of mutant Airfix Nazis locked in frenzied civil war. Slobodan Milosevic, tinpot architect of ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, was voted from power in Serbia in an election he believed he couldn't lose. After sponsoring a decade of civil terror in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, Milosevic reluctantly relinquished control saying he wanted to spend more time with his family. Marko, his son, a racketeer and owner of the Belgrade theme park, Bambiland, promptly fled for Moscow, trailing corruption charges. Tolerance was hard to come by. Shadow Home Secretary Ann Widdecombe launched a wicked witch attack on soft drugs at the Conservative party conference, and found herself in danger of prosecuting seven dope-smoking colleagues. Concerned about teenage pregnancy rates, the Governnent unveiled an advertising campaign instructing young people to keep a grip on themselves: 'Sex: Are you thinking about it enough?' billboards inquired. In his first act as London Mayor, Ken Livingstone decided he would be taking no shit from Trafalgar Square's pigeons, and insisted that tourists cease feeding them. The Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded Gao Xingjian, a Chinese exile living on the nineteenth floor of a Paris towerblock. As a younger man, during the Cultural Revolution, he had been forced to burn 'kilos and kilos' of his own writing. The prize was like 'something that falls on you out of the blue sky,' he said. 'Like a miracle.' NOVEMBER A celebration of the work of England's greatest apocalyptic visionary, William Blake, opened at Tate Britain. The waters rose over our green and pleasant land, swamped by days and nights of rain. Geysers erupted on Salisbury Plain, impromptu ferry services sprang up in villages around York, and thousands were evacuated from sandbagged homes. The floods seemed further incontrovertible proof of global warming, and were accompanied by predictions from the Met Office that temperatures would increase by six degrees in this century, causing water levels to rise by seven metres, inundating every major coastal city in the world. At a conference on climate change in the Hague, Britain's chief negotiator, John Prescott, stormed out after failing to broker a deal on acceptable targets for carbon dioxide emissions between America's intransigent polluters and European environmentalists. Outside the conference, protesters declared that sparring delegates had 'sunk the world'. The new Jerusalem looked a distant prospect. On the West Bank, fighting had been intensifying for a month following the publication of graphic pictures of a 12-year-old Palestinian boy killed in the crossfire between Israeli troops and Arab protesters; one observer suggested that the conflict was 'like a PlayStation game: they have helmets and bulletproof vests but we Arabs have nothing'. Palestinians subsequently gained revenge in an attack on a police station in Ramallah where two Israeli soldiers were lynched, their attackers displaying bloody hands to the mob. Bill Clinton, anxious to seal the end of his presidency with a foreign policy coup intervened, unsuccessfully, for peace. The United States failed in its attempts to decide on a successor to Clinton. The race to the White House between Al Gore and George W. Bush rested on Florida's ballot, which was too close to call, and slowed to a crawl as American courts disagreed on the constitutional process of recounts. Russian President Vladimir Putin, straight-faced, wondered if he could offer Americans assistance in resolving its democratic difficulties. There were songs of innocence and experience. Elton John, in court suing his former manager for mishandling his financial affairs, admitted having once spent \u00a340m in a period of months, including \u00a3300,000 on cut flowers for his home. Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas blew a reported \u00a31.3m on their wedding celebrations at Donald Trump's Plaza Hotel in New York, including \u00a310,000 on a cake. Guests were invited to give cash rather than gifts; a seven-figure deal for exclusive rights to their nuptial photographs, signed with OK! magazine, was undermined by rival Hello! which published unofficial pictures; the happy couple sought an injunction. Proprietor of OK!, soft-porn baron Richard Desmond purchased Express Newspapers from the Labour peer Lord Hollick. Desmond had made his money from magazines such as Nude Readers Wives and Asian Babes. On arrival at the Express, Desmond reportedly 'enjoyed a celebratory drink' with editor Rosie Boycott, founder of Spare Rib. Chris Woodhead, controversial Chief Inspector of Schools, resigned his position in order to take up more lucrative educational work as a consultant to the Daily Telegraph and to Bell Pottinger, Margaret Thatcher's favourite PR firm. The Weakest Link, a quiz show loosely based on the notion that there is 'no such thing as society' moved to prime time on the BBC. Its host, Anne Robinson, employed the authentic rhetoric of the Ofsted inspectorate: 'You are the weakest link. Goodbye.' Judith Keppel, a distant cousin of Camilla Parker Bowles, was the first jackpot winner on ITV's Who Wants to be a Millionaire?; she had invested \u00a31,000 in phone calls to earn a place on the show.

Richard Branson lost the chance to run the People's Lottery - and more priceless personal branding as a beneficient billionaire - and retired to his private island to contemplate might-have-beens. Tony Blair suggested that perhaps, in hindsight, the Dome had not been quite the 'runaway success' he'd predicted, though he did not ever actually set foot in the 'Blame Zone'. The highlight of the Millennium Experience was generally agreed have been the failed heist in November, in which a team of theme-park jewel thieves launched an attempt to steal a Diamond as Big as the Faith Zone, foiled by police thinly disguised as cleaners and eager tourists.

Is there a single one of this liberal \u00e9lite prepared to be a socialist example?' </p> <p>Perhaps not. Yet what he is describing is not so much socialism as Christianity. I try, probably unsuccess fully, to ascribe to those ideals but it is years since I was a member of the Labour Party. Today, I settle for being a Liberal Democrat, and trying to be a Christian. <br> <b> Alfred Baker</b><br> Tunbridge Wells, Kent </p> <p><b> Rotten Rowe </b></p> <p> It was sad, on Christmas Eve of all days, to read the report of Tory backbencher Andrew Rowe undermining the position of minority groups under the pretence of defending Christian organisations in their appeals for central government funds (News, last week). </p> <p>I stood against Andrew in 1997 as Labour Party candidate for Faversham and Mid Kent, and I know that he is both intelligent enough and astute enough to understand the significance of his remarks. Back then, he was also sufficiently principled to appear embarrassed by some of his party's policies and he always looked a bit ill at ease in the company of many of the activists of his newly formed constituency association. <br> <b> Alan Stewart </b><br> Macclesfield, Cheshire </p> <p><b> A cheap shot </b> </p> <p> I am appalled by the destructive editorial cynicism evident in your layout (Letters, last week) in which a serious and well-argued plea from Paul Foot, Edward Said, Noam Chomsky, Harold Pinter, Tony Benn and others to stop the slaughter by Israeli soldiers and settlers of Palestinian protesters is negated by being used as a frame for an image of a masked Palestinian brandishing a pistol. </p> <p>The letter calls upon people to recognise the politics of that process and to protest it, but its presentation inverts its message, not only by portraying victims as aggressors but also by transforming pragmatic politics into a struggle of world religions. <br> <b> Glenn Bowman</b><br> University of Kent, Canterbury </p> <p><b> Apple sauce </b></p> <p> While I do not deny the Committee on Standards and Privileges may have 'fudged' the Reid/Maxton judgment (News, last week), I would like to draw peoples' attention to the fact that it was not an accusation of being found with one's fingers in the till; it was the accusation of putting the money in the till. Compared to the US system, Reid and Maxton were allegedly caught 'scrumping apples'. </p> <p>Perhaps it is more pertinent to ask 'What do we mean by democracy?' and 'How do we promote it?' Alternatively, how to vote out the major political winner in this country and probably in most liberal democratic states - Apathy! <br> <b> Gordon G. Davidson </b><br> Ellon, Aberdeenshire</p>",

Simon Icke Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire Up and at 'em My reaction to the headline 'Women to fight on front line' (News, last week) was that this is very old news - they have been on the front line for many a year. Tim Harrap Bridport, Dorset Christian soldier Bob Holman wrote (Letters, last week): 'Socialism is about promoting equality by having just a modest income, by being close to the materially needy, and conceding power to the socially deprived. Is there a single one of this liberal \u00e9lite prepared to be a socialist example?' Perhaps not. Yet what he is describing is not so much socialism as Christianity. I try, probably unsuccess fully, to ascribe to those ideals but it is years since I was a member of the Labour Party. Today, I settle for being a Liberal Democrat, and trying to be a Christian. Alfred Baker Tunbridge Wells, Kent Rotten Rowe It was sad, on Christmas Eve of all days, to read the report of Tory backbencher Andrew Rowe undermining the position of minority groups under the pretence of defending Christian organisations in their appeals for central government funds (News, last week). I stood against Andrew in 1997 as Labour Party candidate for Faversham and Mid Kent, and I know that he is both intelligent enough and astute enough to understand the significance of his remarks. Back then, he was also sufficiently principled to appear embarrassed by some of his party's policies and he always looked a bit ill at ease in the company of many of the activists of his newly formed constituency association. Alan Stewart Macclesfield, Cheshire A cheap shot I am appalled by the destructive editorial cynicism evident in your layout (Letters, last week) in which a serious and well-argued plea from Paul Foot, Edward Said, Noam Chomsky, Harold Pinter, Tony Benn and others to stop the slaughter by Israeli soldiers and settlers of Palestinian protesters is negated by being used as a frame for an image of a masked Palestinian brandishing a pistol. The letter calls upon people to recognise the politics of that process and to protest it, but its presentation inverts its message, not only by portraying victims as aggressors but also by transforming pragmatic politics into a struggle of world religions. Glenn Bowman University of Kent, Canterbury Apple sauce While I do not deny the Committee on Standards and Privileges may have 'fudged' the Reid/Maxton judgment (News, last week), I would like to draw peoples' attention to the fact that it was not an accusation of being found with one's fingers in the till; it was the accusation of putting the money in the till. Compared to the US system, Reid and Maxton were allegedly caught 'scrumping apples'. Perhaps it is more pertinent to ask 'What do we mean by democracy?' and 'How do we promote it?' Alternatively, how to vote out the major political winner in this country and probably in most liberal democratic states - Apathy! Gordon G. Davidson Ellon, Aberdeenshire",

      "body": "<p>The British entered the first year of the new century with our flattering self-image facing a challenge. It was a touch difficult to believe in native tolerance, decency and an innate sense of fair play when asylum-seekers were being libelled by the far-Right press and persecuted by the Government. Tony Blair ordered them to live way below the poverty line on \u00a310 a week in cash and \u00a326 in asylo-vouchers while they waited years for his vastly incompetent Home Office to deal with their claims. To add insult to penury, he allowed supermarkets to pocket the change when refugees exchanged vouchers for food.</p> <p>To William Hague, these were the wet tactics of the liberal \u00e9lite. He wanted all refugees to be locked in internment camps. In a neat example of the under-examined phenomenon of right-wing political correctness, Hague insisted on calling the camps 'reception centres', as if prisons for people who have committed no crime (and are often the victims of the world's worst criminals) were hotels and the warders were receptionists cooing 'enjoy' and 'have a nice day'.</p> <p>Never mind. Tony Blair announced a new holiday which will allow everyone to feel jolly good about dear old Blighty. On 27 January, we can have a nice Holocaust Memorial Day. The BBC and Home Office will invite us to reflect on the beastliness of the Germans of a mere 60 years ago and pity the plight of refugees from Nazism.</p> <p>The Foreign Office has insisted, and the independent BBC has accepted, that there should be no tactless mention of Turkey's genocide of the Armenians in the First World War, the mass slaughter that inspired Hitler.</p> <p>When Turkey is not pushing Kurds into seeking what sanctuary is on offer in Fortress Europe, it gets very ticklish on the Armenian question. It threatened to expel US troops from its territory if the American Congress described the carnage as 'genocide' and has put an Armenian priest on trial for speaking out. (A life sentence could follow if he is convicted.) One of the stated aims of Holocaust Memorial Day is to rebut denial of genocide, but the good intention is strictly circumscribed. When Nazis and other crackpots on the fringe deny, they must be fought ferociously.

      "bodyText": "The British entered the first year of the new century with our flattering self-image facing a challenge. It was a touch difficult to believe in native tolerance, decency and an innate sense of fair play when asylum-seekers were being libelled by the far-Right press and persecuted by the Government. Tony Blair ordered them to live way below the poverty line on \u00a310 a week in cash and \u00a326 in asylo-vouchers while they waited years for his vastly incompetent Home Office to deal with their claims. To add insult to penury, he allowed supermarkets to pocket the change when refugees exchanged vouchers for food. To William Hague, these were the wet tactics of the liberal \u00e9lite. He wanted all refugees to be locked in internment camps. In a neat example of the under-examined phenomenon of right-wing political correctness, Hague insisted on calling the camps 'reception centres', as if prisons for people who have committed no crime (and are often the victims of the world's worst criminals) were hotels and the warders were receptionists cooing 'enjoy' and 'have a nice day'. Never mind. Tony Blair announced a new holiday which will allow everyone to feel jolly good about dear old Blighty. On 27 January, we can have a nice Holocaust Memorial Day. The BBC and Home Office will invite us to reflect on the beastliness of the Germans of a mere 60 years ago and pity the plight of refugees from Nazism. The Foreign Office has insisted, and the independent BBC has accepted, that there should be no tactless mention of Turkey's genocide of the Armenians in the First World War, the mass slaughter that inspired Hitler. When Turkey is not pushing Kurds into seeking what sanctuary is on offer in Fortress Europe, it gets very ticklish on the Armenian question. It threatened to expel US troops from its territory if the American Congress described the carnage as 'genocide' and has put an Armenian priest on trial for speaking out. (A life sentence could follow if he is convicted.) One of the stated aims of Holocaust Memorial Day is to rebut denial of genocide, but the good intention is strictly circumscribed. When Nazis and other crackpots on the fringe deny, they must be fought ferociously. When a fellow Nato power with large export markets does the same, respectful reticence is in order. Speaking of dictatorships, the Government's Stalinist reputation was enhanced in February when a study by the Liberal Democrats found that the Blair administration produces more targets than an Soviet apparatchik with a gun at his head. Five thousand have been set since May 1997 as noble and banal aspirations were sent whirling around Whitehall.

It is to be hoped that Massive Attack and Radiohead will cap 10 years of innovation with their new releases, giving a fillip to all those who believe that pop still matters. </p> <p>Massive Attack, arguably the most influential and critic-friendly band of the past decade, will resurface after a three-year hiatus - minus founder member Mushroom - with a new album late in 2001. Their first release, Blue Lines, was a classic and they haven't made a dud yet. Surely it's too late to start now? </p> <p>Radiohead are not on such firm ground. They return with a new album largely culled from the same sessions that produced this year's Kid A. Amnesiac (March/April) promises to be a less esoteric listen, although vocalist Thom Yorke believes the new release is 'really fat and dark'. </p> <p>Manic Street Preachers will want to retain their credibility with their sixth album, provisionally titled Know Your Enemy (March). Connoisseurs will be pleased to note contributions from DJ David Holmes and My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields. The Manics have also pulled off a promotional coup, becoming the first Western band to perform in Cuba. On 17 February, 5,000 fans will pack the Karl Marx Theatre in Havana for a first listen to the new songs. </p> <p>After a year of personal upheavals and a poorly received album, Oasis will attempt to break America yet again, this time supporting the Black Crowes on tour. Meanwhile, Noel Gallagher plans to release a solo album later in the year. Comeback of the year is a tie between two AWOL dance acts: New Order and Stereo MCs. After a much-publicised rift, the pioneering Mancunian quartet have re-formed and are busy working on their first album since 1993's Republic. Remember the Stereo MCs? They're finally about to release Deep Down and Dirty, their follow-up to 1992's hugely popular Connected. </p> <p>It will be interesting to compare the old guard with the likes of the Chemical Brothers, Basement Jaxx, Air and Daft Punk who are also working on new material. While UK Garage should continue to rule clubland. Bj\u00f6rk fans, too, can look forward to a new album. </p> <p>The past year has been characterised by hits from artists of whom little or nothing was known 12 months ago. So Craig David, Badly Drawn Boy and Coldplay flourished as Oasis and Radiohead trod water. In 2001, the biggest names in pop can strike back. </p> <p>The industry is buzzing with rumours about the new Michael Jackson album, partly produced by Rodney Jerkins (Destiny's Child, Whitney Houston) and reportedly featuring Slash and R Kelly. Jackson has been such a peripheral figure of late that it's easy to forget he's the same age as Madonna. But can he match her flair for reinvention? Don't expect a makeover for the Boss, though. Bruce Springsteen is said to be going in the opposite direction, teaming up with the E Street Band again. Does that mean he's going to drag Steve Van Zandt from his current acting gig on The Sopranos? Someone should inform Tony. </p> <p>Guns N' Roses are also making their first album in six years, but with a depleted line-up and fanbase, they're unlikely to be essential listening. More worthy of attention is the burgeoning breed of hard rock or nu metal American acts that include Amen, Slipnot and At the Drive-In. </p> <p>Their music can seem secondary to the occult rituals, self-mutilation and vomiting over fellow band members, but they have caught the Zeitgeist in the States, feeding into the kind of nihilism that seemingly inspires Eminem. Judging by the reaction to nu metal bands at festivals at Leeds and Reading in 2000, they also have a potentially massive following here. </p> <p>Black American music is in a healthy state, with new releases from Lauryn Hill and Macy Gray to cheer. Hip-hop should continue in the same rootsy vein as of late with a headline release from Method Man, and expect to hear more from recent chart debutant Nelly and experienced campaigners Outkast. </p> <p>So hip-hop will continue to equal street cred.

They have cut down on the samples and upped the musicianship from their first release, 1998's Northern Sulphuric Soul. And they're British which counts for something because, aside from Soul II Soul (the jury is still out on Craig David), successful soul music has usually been imported. </p> <p>Of course, Rae &amp; Christian have brought in Womack, but the results are stunning, especially on the first single, 'Get A Life' - a stirring, jazz-tinged call to arms that is sophisticated, passionate music at its best.</p>",

Admittedly, I hadn't yet learnt my lines, but I reckoned I could pull it off with the help of idiot boards, just like Brando in Apocalypse Now. Hopefully, I too might be shot in flattering gloomvision. Back home, I pondered my motivation. I hadn't dared ask why I had been chosen to play the microscopically small, but frankly pivotal role of Martina Chatwin, though I had a big hunch: 'Martina' is a broadsheet hackette who writes a first-person confessional column, and given that I hadn't done that sort thing for, ooh, years, the Sunday Times 's Liz Jones must already have turned it down. Then there was the undeniably worrying fact that Martina was, in the words of David Baddiel's character (an angsty thirtysomething called David Baddiel): 'a cow'. </p> <p>I think it takes balls to say to someone, 'Would you like to play a complete cow whose character is, in fact, not terribly loosely based on you...', and so I should have the guts to prove that - ha!ha!ha! - I could laugh at myself, or at least the me they humorously perceived me to be, while also bringing something extra to Martina: a level of humanity and grace that was, admittedly, not altogether evident in the script. And all of this in roughly 90 seconds of airtime. Who wouldn't leap at that sort of challenge, given that there are so few good parts for journalists in their mid-thirties? Hey, Martina might be a cow, but she was a well-written cow. </p> <p>At Teddington Studios, I had a dressing-room with my name on the door and a horrible costume on a hanger. This came as no surprise because if Martina was going to be 'a cow' hidden inside the Versace-clad body of a love goddess, then they would have given the part to Liz Hurley. Indeed it is, I think, fair to say that I eventually emerged from hair and make-up looking like Olive from On The Buses. I enjoyed the whole experience very much but there was no escaping the fact that, even as my heart said, 'You are Uma Thurman', the TV monitor said, 'You are in panto in Wolverhampton playing the Ugly Sister's slightly uglier banjo-strumming cousin'. </p> <p>So, after several fraught months on a rigorous high-collagen/low-carb diet, last week I again summoned the courage to speak to Peter Bradshaw - Baddiel's Syndrome 's co-writer, co-star (and memorably, in episode six, Martina Chatwin's boyfriend), not to mention the Guardian 's film critic, who once sensibly turned down a part in a production of Cyrano de Bergerac directed by some bloke called Sam Mendes but has finally got himself a proper acting break. </p> <p>After some polite obfuscation in response to my inquiry about the genesis of Martina's character ('well, obviously, it was based on your book and column...'), Bradshaw admitted that:'If we get recommissioned, you may have to clear your schedule.'

Just like Las Vegas's other major landmarks, from the Versace outlet in Caesar's Palace to the Hard Rock, the Guggenheim is part of a worldwide franchise chain. </p> <p>And in a calculated game of double-bluff, its architecture is just as themed as the Las Vegas mirror-glass Great Pyramid hotel of the Luxor, and the prefabricated Palladianism of the Venetian resort. But Koolhaas's theme is the ultimately exotic post- industrial recycled warehouse that has become the style of choice for the contemporary gallery rather than anything with older historical roots. </p> <p>Since Las Vegas has never had any industry beyond the thousands of workers who daily tend its slot machines, Koolhaas is building something that looks like an old warehouse, completed with travelling crane, from scratch. It has the same relationship to the real thing as Las Vegas's own half-size version of the Empire State has to the original. Its first, suitably Las Vegas-friendly show, devoted to the motorcycle, is being designed by Frank Gehry. </p> <p>In Britain, the big millennium-funded projects in London are mostly out of the way now, but we will still be seeing the completion of some major new investments in cultural plant in the next year. Tate Britain is hoping that unveiling a new range of galleries in the summer, designed by John Miller and deftly inserted into one of its courtyards, will help to restore visitor numbers badly hit by the opening of Tate Modern. </p> <p>The most impressive British project of 2001 looks like being the Baltic in Gateshead, a conversion of a grain silo into 300,000 square feet of space devoted to the contemporary arts on six levels designed by Dominic Williams of Ellis Williams. </p> <p>In cultural terms, the biggest architectural events in 2001 are likely not to be new buildings but two blockbuster exhibitions devoted to Mies van der Rohe that will run side by side at the Museum of Modern Art, and the Whitney Museum in New York ( 21 June-11 September). Re-establishing a reputation 32 years after the death of the brooding Ger man-American apostle of architectural restraint will do as much as any new building to realign the direction of contemporary design. </p> <p>Enough time has gone by for Mies to emerge from the period when he was under attack from all sides. In the eyes of the postmodernists, less was not more as Mies had it, but a bore. With the benefit of fresh eyes, it's clear that he succeeded in defining architecture in a way that was basically optimistic. </p> <p>At a time when the nihilism represented by Koolhaas is in the ascendant, it is a valuable reminder of what architecture can be. </p> <p><strong>My Highlight of the Coming Year</strong></p> <p>Due to open in the autumn, the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art began life as the Baltic Flour Mills, built in Gateshead in 1950 on the bank of the Tyne. It looked vaguely art deco, a bit like a slimmed-down version of Battersea power station, shorn of its chimney at each corner. </p> <p>Its working life as a mill came to an end in 1981 and, as part of its plans to regenerate the waterfront, Gateshead Council began to look at the feasibility of reusing it as a cultural building rather than demolishing what had become a familiar local landmark. </p> <p>The architect Dominic Williams won the competition for the conversion in 1994, and established his practice, Ellis Williams Architects, on the strength of it. </p> <p>Unlike Tate Modern, whose architects took a determinedly restrained approach to remodelling Bankside, Williams's design makes it quite clear that the mills have a new use now. While the brick skin survives, the old grain silos have been hollowed out and floored to create six internal levels. And a giant, wing-shaped door, four floors high, brings natural light into the centre of the building. The exterior is decked with lifts, and a roof-top restaurant juts out towards the neighbouring new millennium bridge. The \u00a346m project will provide 100 000 sq ft in total, including galleries and working studios. It combines urban renewal with a bold and creative approach to the arts. </p> <p>The Baltic has been running an exhibition programme since its director, Sune Nordgren, was appointed in 1997 - most impressively with an installation by the sculptor Anish Kapoor.

      "body": "<p>The year 2001 is the one of the Great Exhibition - or the grandiose title, for certain. Just consider what we're promised: Zero to Infinity, Desire Unbound, The Soul of Paris, The Genius of Rome. Berlin, Washington, Amsterdam and Tokyo will all be despatching their art like greeting cards from across the globe. No more need for the city break, then: we might as well stop at home. </p> <p>Tate Modern has not one but nine cities in a single, extravagantly ambitious exhibition. Century City (1 February) is a whistle-stop tour from Paris to Lagos, Moscow and Bombay, each metropolis a 'creative flashpoint' at some stage of the twentieth century. The empty Turbine Hall will echo with the sounds of Schoenberg and the bossa nova. The galleries will be filled with Fauvism, Suprematism, Pop, Op and Neo-Geo. Expect miles of film and video - plus queues from here to Timbuctoo. </p> <p>The Whitechapel celebrates its own century (10 March) with proud highlights from the past - Malevich, Mondrian, Pollock, Rothko and Kiefer. The National Gallery travels back to the nineteenth century, borrowing 80 masterpieces from its Berlin counterpart (7 March). This should be a stunning survey: from German Romanticism to the early modernism of Manet, Monet and C\u00e9zanne. </p> <p>You could, indeed, get the story of art - minus a few chapters - without leaving Britain this year. Tate Britain has medieval sculpture from June. The Royal Academy is showing Pisanello in September, Botticelli in March. It's also borrowing masterworks by Caravaggio, Carracci, Rubens et al for The Genius of Rome 1592-1623 (20 January) - go and swoon. </p> <p>Rembrandt is back yet again, or at least his portly women, in a show that opens at the National Gallery in Scotland on 8 June and travels to London in September. Vermeer and the Delft School is at the National Gallery (6 June). For anyone with a sweet tooth, there is also Murillo: Scenes of Childhood at the Dulwich Picture Gallery (14 February). </p> <p>I could go on through this exhaustive almanac, mentioning James Gillray at Tate Britain (6 June), Ingres to Matisse (RA, 30 June) or the Hokusai show at the British Museum from 11 May. But you will be wondering about those innovative, novel or even just contemporary exhibitions - something to make you gasp and stretch your eyes. </p> <p>In the absence of a British Art Show, a Liverpool Biennial or another Apocalypse , there isn't much to report at this stage. The Serpentine (30 January) has invited Hans Haacke, German conceptualist and self-appointed art martyr, to meddle with the objects in the V&amp;A for his own purposes - generally political, always mischievous. There is contemporary art from America (Barbican, October), Brazil (MoMA, July) and Japan (Hayward, October). But so far, nobody is trying to shoehorn three dozen artists together on the grounds that they all make jokes or lists or wilfully poor paintings. </p> <p>Solo shows seem to be this year's contemporary format: specifically younger women and older men. Rachel Whiteread is at the Serpentine in June and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in September. Tates Liverpool and Britain have Lisa Milroy and Tacita Dean in January and February, respectively. Christine Borland, Emma Kay and Abigail Lane are all having one-woman shows. Mark Wallinger, after some deliberation, will be representing Britain at the Venice Biennale. </p> <p>Two of the biggest shows this year are so long-awaited they almost feel like come-backs - Malcolm Morley at the Hayward (15 June) and Frank Auerbach at the Royal Academy (14 September). It's good to see these great British painters, now in their seventies, getting their belated due at full stretch. But the show I am most looking forward to centres on one of the longest careers in the history of art: Goya: Drawing From His Private Albums (22 February) at the Hayward Gallery. </p> <p><strong>My Highlight of the Coming Year</strong></p> <p>Lost drawings, dark drawings, drawings from the final nights of his life: the exhibition of Goya's private albums at the Hayward Gallery in February will surely be one of the most powerful shows anywhere in Britain this year. In 1793, Goya contracted an illness that left him permanently stone deaf. For the next 35 years, until his death in Bordeaux at 82, he drew incessantly on sheets of paper stitched by his own hand into journal-sized volumes. </p> <p>Like journals in that they reveal so much of what Goya was thinking and feeling, these books were unstitched, sold by the page and dispersed across the world after his death. Some drawings have disappeared, others are only now being found. An amazing little figure, tumbling down a cliff, clothes billowing, arms flailing, was recently discovered in Marseilles.

      "bodyText": "The year 2001 is the one of the Great Exhibition - or the grandiose title, for certain. Just consider what we're promised: Zero to Infinity, Desire Unbound, The Soul of Paris, The Genius of Rome. Berlin, Washington, Amsterdam and Tokyo will all be despatching their art like greeting cards from across the globe. No more need for the city break, then: we might as well stop at home. Tate Modern has not one but nine cities in a single, extravagantly ambitious exhibition. Century City (1 February) is a whistle-stop tour from Paris to Lagos, Moscow and Bombay, each metropolis a 'creative flashpoint' at some stage of the twentieth century. The empty Turbine Hall will echo with the sounds of Schoenberg and the bossa nova. The galleries will be filled with Fauvism, Suprematism, Pop, Op and Neo-Geo. Expect miles of film and video - plus queues from here to Timbuctoo. The Whitechapel celebrates its own century (10 March) with proud highlights from the past - Malevich, Mondrian, Pollock, Rothko and Kiefer. The National Gallery travels back to the nineteenth century, borrowing 80 masterpieces from its Berlin counterpart (7 March). This should be a stunning survey: from German Romanticism to the early modernism of Manet, Monet and C\u00e9zanne. You could, indeed, get the story of art - minus a few chapters - without leaving Britain this year. Tate Britain has medieval sculpture from June. The Royal Academy is showing Pisanello in September, Botticelli in March. It's also borrowing masterworks by Caravaggio, Carracci, Rubens et al for The Genius of Rome 1592-1623 (20 January) - go and swoon. Rembrandt is back yet again, or at least his portly women, in a show that opens at the National Gallery in Scotland on 8 June and travels to London in September. Vermeer and the Delft School is at the National Gallery (6 June). For anyone with a sweet tooth, there is also Murillo: Scenes of Childhood at the Dulwich Picture Gallery (14 February). I could go on through this exhaustive almanac, mentioning James Gillray at Tate Britain (6 June), Ingres to Matisse (RA, 30 June) or the Hokusai show at the British Museum from 11 May. But you will be wondering about those innovative, novel or even just contemporary exhibitions - something to make you gasp and stretch your eyes. In the absence of a British Art Show, a Liverpool Biennial or another Apocalypse , there isn't much to report at this stage. The Serpentine (30 January) has invited Hans Haacke, German conceptualist and self-appointed art martyr, to meddle with the objects in the V&amp;A for his own purposes - generally political, always mischievous. There is contemporary art from America (Barbican, October), Brazil (MoMA, July) and Japan (Hayward, October). But so far, nobody is trying to shoehorn three dozen artists together on the grounds that they all make jokes or lists or wilfully poor paintings. Solo shows seem to be this year's contemporary format: specifically younger women and older men. Rachel Whiteread is at the Serpentine in June and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in September. Tates Liverpool and Britain have Lisa Milroy and Tacita Dean in January and February, respectively. Christine Borland, Emma Kay and Abigail Lane are all having one-woman shows. Mark Wallinger, after some deliberation, will be representing Britain at the Venice Biennale. Two of the biggest shows this year are so long-awaited they almost feel like come-backs - Malcolm Morley at the Hayward (15 June) and Frank Auerbach at the Royal Academy (14 September). It's good to see these great British painters, now in their seventies, getting their belated due at full stretch. But the show I am most looking forward to centres on one of the longest careers in the history of art: Goya: Drawing From His Private Albums (22 February) at the Hayward Gallery. My Highlight of the Coming Year Lost drawings, dark drawings, drawings from the final nights of his life: the exhibition of Goya's private albums at the Hayward Gallery in February will surely be one of the most powerful shows anywhere in Britain this year. In 1793, Goya contracted an illness that left him permanently stone deaf. For the next 35 years, until his death in Bordeaux at 82, he drew incessantly on sheets of paper stitched by his own hand into journal-sized volumes. Like journals in that they reveal so much of what Goya was thinking and feeling, these books were unstitched, sold by the page and dispersed across the world after his death. Some drawings have disappeared, others are only now being found. An amazing little figure, tumbling down a cliff, clothes billowing, arms flailing, was recently discovered in Marseilles. It was identified by Juliet Wilson-Bareau, curator of this exhibition. 'In so many of these drawings you see people totter or collapse. For Goya, this is the human condition: we're born, we climb the ladder of life and then we tumble down the other side. He makes the predicament seem humorous and absurd, but this latest drawing is also a terrifying image.' A witch with a rope - for strangling or skipping? Inquisitors jostling in Klansmen hoods - ridiculous or incredibly menacing? One hundred drawings, many with captions, yet Goya never tells you what to think. 'These are the creative springs to all his other work,' says Wilson-Bareau. 'Witness them close up - so vivid, urgent, jumping from the page - and you can almost see his hand being pushed by his imagination. They're very complex: sharp touches and glints of black ink against luminous paper in the late works, light versus dark being so completely his subject. What's so moving is to see the dirty sheet edges. These were really well-thumbed little volumes. These drawings are the fundamental language of his art.'

'Just tell me, John, what the hell is the point of it all?' said the email from the editor, although it probably had somewhat more potency before I coyly changed the word to 'hell'.</p> <p>Bizarrely, people hint at much the same question all the time, although few of them put it quite so starkly or are prepared to pay me to try and answer it. This is hardly a boast: were you in my position, they might do the same to you. They think I know something nobody else knows, that I've found the secret answer to a question which, through fear or embarrassment they can't quite bring themselves to ask.</p> <p>My position is this: I have an apparently terminal disease which doesn't allow me to make any realistic plans for more than a couple of months ahead, a voice which stopped when my cancerous tongue was removed, a diet entirely dependent on the food blender, and a fair to middling amount of pain on most days. To add insult to cancerous injury, I neither feel the need of nor can I discover any comfort in religious faith and I take refuge, legally or otherwise, in no more than the occasional dose of mind-nudging drugs.</p> <p>And yet most of the time, and within the usual limits, I seem to be happy, even - given my willingness to accept commissions like this one - smugly so. What, they want to know, is the trick?</p> <p>Well, yes, there's the nice house and the reasonable income from a cushy job that lets me show off in public the loving wife and family, the circle of supportive friends who indulge me in my various whims. To that extent, I suppose I have it all, or as much of it as it's possible to have under the circumstances. But those circumstances do make a difference: I might have it better than most tongueless terminal cases, but I know of no scale against which one can compare friends, family and possessions with the prospect of a long and healthy life. Would I swap a child or a friend or the family house for a new working tongue and a clear scan? Don't even ask, and not least because I'll never have to make the choice.</p> <p>But it's a fair assumption on the part of my inquisitors: with so little time left for living, what is there to live for?</p> <p>The easy answer is Philip Larkin's about none of us ever being able to get out of bed in the morning if we had any real sense of our own mortality, and it seems to be an answer borne out by the mortality statistics. Depressed and fraught as we're all meant to be with our fast and unlivable modern lives, last year only 5,000 or so of us were so desperately unable to cope with it all that we killed ourselves, which ranks the act of suicide alongside one or two of the less common cancers as a cause of death. Even if we don't know what there is to live for, we all want to carry on living. Well of course we do - it's what we're programmed for. A species which could take life or leave it alone wouldn't get anywhere like this far in the lottery of evolution; I imagine that death is as much of an unwanted shock to the day-old and senile mayfly as it is to the average Briton who has reached the age at which death is to be expected.</p> <p>Indeed, before all this happened to me I used sometimes to wonder what it must feel like to be 78 or 82 or 90 and wake up every morning knowing not that today might be your last, but that whatever happened the chances were against life continuing for much longer. How, I wondered, could the Saga company sell holidays to all those elderly types in their elastic-waisted trousers and their treble-E fitting sandals? What were the customers expecting to bring back from their gentle cruise in the Med? Memories? But surely they have enough memories. What can you do with memories when you have only months or a few years to play with them? How can you relax on that cruise when every morning you wake up surprised still to be here and anxious that tomorrow you might not?</p> <p>Except that here I am, a nominal 47 but in the position of an energetic and slightly breathless 90-year-old with most, but not all, of his faculties, knowing that the chances are against my seeing more than one more birthday and yet I wake up as keen as ever I was to improve the shining hour. I am as happy as I seem to be, yes, but that's because this side of sociopathy or advanced religious zealotry we can only take so much happiness before we are saturated with it. We have a limited capacity for happiness, but an almost infinitely unlimited capacity for, well, not unhappiness exactly, but non-happiness.</p> <p>Which, I imagine, is why much of the time we are as fulfilled by the various forms of personal non-happiness - anger, disappointment, envy, hatred, frustration, fear, alienation - as we are by contentment. This article, for instance, is a rarity in the British press, with its chirpy positivism and its imminent injunction to look on the bright side. Apart from tales of individual bravery, endeavour or luck, most newspaper stories are designed to enrage, upset, frighten and otherwise encourage all those negative emotions of jealousy and territoriality which we seem to relish, which is why papers published by the types who ask 'Why can't there be more good news in the papers?' invariably fail.</p> <p>But the truth is that in the developed world, for most of us, most of the time, life is as good as it ever could be and infinitely better than it was for any generation preceding ours. As a teenager, I was, like millions of others, taken with the utopianism of William Morris's News From Nowhere and the description of a society where equality and social justice prevailed and as a result fear, anger, jealousy and the rest of it fell away. It wasn't just that everyone in that impossible world had plenty to eat, a roof over their head and fulfilling work, but that they never woke up feeling grumpy, never envied anyone else their greater happiness, never suffered, in short, from the iniquities not of economic distribution but those of serotonin levels and pain thresholds.</p> <p>Yes, I know it's easy for me in the soft South to say it, and I know that there is real poverty and deprivation in the country, that the income gap is widening and the distribution of the country's wealth is getting less equitable by the day. And yes, I know too that it's no comfort to the freezing pensioner or the confined single mother at the end of her tether to know that three or four generations ago their lives would have been regarded by the freezing and confined masses as normal or even comparatively desirable. But the fact remains that for the first time in the history of our species, the vast majority of us in the West have more than enough to eat, somewhere relatively warm to live, the ability to move ourselves around the country and even the world as the fancy takes us, a sufficiency of resources with which we can entertain and distract ourselves.</p> <p>I understand why when the Roundtree Trust reports on poverty in Britain it annoys Daily Mail readers (or, more usually, writers) by including a TV and video recorder in the list of essentials without which normal life isn't considered possible, but I can't bring myself to believe that the reason for most of the unhappiness in the country has to do with economic imbalance as much as it does with some innate need for a couple of portions of discontent as part of our psyche's emotional diet.</p> <p>But even if you can't agree with that as a description of the country as a whole, let's look at it as a description of you and me, that part of society which reads lengthy essays in broadsheet Sunday newspapers and which, by that definition, has enough superfluous income to afford the paper and enough superfluous time to read it.</p> <p>The other week, I wrote in this paper about alternative medicine. Briefly put, I was, and am, against it because I think it doesn't work on real organic illness. I don't want to rehearse that argument again here, but what I didn't point out in the piece is that the boom in alternative medicine has little to do with the failure of orthodox remedies to cure serious disease - the vast majority of people with heart conditions or cancer or what have you still, quite rightly, submit to the orthodoxy - but with the alternativists' claims to be able to deal with illnesses which orthodox doctors can't diagnose, let alone treat.</p> <p>They are, if you like, the luxury illnesses, the illnesses which can be afforded by a society with too little to worry about. In my pre-cancerous, hypochondriacal days, I was forever presenting my GP with vague symp toms of even vaguer illnesses, being sent off for blood tests, investigations to see whether my fluttering heartbeat was a sign of something more organically entrenched than a mere fondness for too many cigarettes, late nights and dodgy social situations. They are the illnesses which result from overexpectation, from the belief that we can feel happy, comfortable, positive, motivated all the time. But to feel that good that often you have to be pretty stupid in that way that stupidity so often manifests itself, as a lack of imagination.</p> <p>But because most of us aren't stupid and do have enough imagination to posit a world beyond our immediate and personal space and time we create worries which previous generations wouldn't have had time for. It's no coincidence, for instance, that animal rights as anything but the most intellectual of concepts has arrived as a popular movement only with postwar prosperity. Only the rich, with their Gore-Tex and Polar Fleeces can afford to be sniffy about animal skins; in polar societies where you skin a seal or die of hypothermia the options for animal liberationists are more limited.</p> <p>Or we worry about televised violence but rarely stop to consider that ours is one of a handful of recent generations which only sees that sort of violence on television. I, for instance, have never seen a dead body in, as it were, the flesh, but I doubt if my four-times great grandfather escaping the pogroms of Russia could have said that, or even somebody brought up in a big city during the war. My children have seen only the most cartoon-like violence and are none the less shocked by it; a London child 200 years ago would have lived in a town surrounded by death, disease, prostitution, violence and poverty on a level we can only imagine.</p> <p>It's the same with politics generally. Until relatively recently, mass political movements were still about basic rights of food, shelter, education and self-sufficiency. The reason fewer people vote these days, or turn up to political meetings, is that for the vast majority of us those rights have been fulfilled. The nearest thing we had to a political rally this year had nothing to do with the rights of man or human suffering or any of the subjects which my forebears - or even my younger self - would have recognised as the sort of thing which brought a country to its knees; no, it was about the price of petrol, and although at one level it was about the conditions that lorry drivers and farmers operate under, for the most part it was about how much it costs us to drive in our own cars into work every day.</p> <p>The nonsense of the campaign as a chapter in the movement for human rights became most apparent when the lorry drivers hijacked the spectre of the Jarrow March to push their essentially petit-bourgeois message. But then, that's the nature of modern politics and the only time you'll see the old political icons these days are in adverts for mobile phones or foreign holidays where phrases like 'Join the revolution!' and 'Cry freedom!' are bandied about for a generation which knows nothing of their provenance. Just as we have luxury illnesses to replace the real ones, so we now have luxury politics.</p> <p>All of which seems to have distracted me from the chirpiness I promised and, more importantly, the answer to the editor's question.</p> <p>And the answer is this:</p> <p>This is what it's all about. It's about reading a paper on a Sunday morning while you're thinking about whether you can be arsed to go to the neighbours' New Year's Eve party tonight. It's about getting angry with me for having different opinions from yours or not expressing the ones you have as well as you would have expressed them. It's about the breakfast you've just had and the dinner you're going to have. It's about the random acts of kindness which still, magically, preponderate over acts of incivility or nastiness. It's about rereading Great Expectations and about who's going to win the 3.30 at Haydock Park. It's about being able to watch old episodes of Frasier on satellite TV whenever we want, having the choice of three dozen breakfast cereals and seven brands of virgin olive oil at Sainsbury's. It's about loving and being loved, about doing the right thing, about one day being missed when we're gone.</p> <p>And that's all it's about. It isn't about heaven and hell or the love of Christ or Allah or Yahveh because even if those things do exist, they don't have to exist for us to get on with it.</p> <p>It is, above all I suppose, about passing time. And the only thing I know that you don't is that time passes at the same rate and in much the same way whether you're going to live to 48 or 148. Why am I happy? Because I'm alive. And the simple answer to the question 'What the hell is the point of it all' is this is the point of it all. You aren't happy? Yes you are: this, here, now, is what happiness is. Enjoy it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Like most journalists I'm loath to let light in on the magic that is the editorial process, but this was the first commission I've had in 20-odd years in the game which read quite so much like an extract from a suicide note. 'Just tell me, John, what the hell is the point of it all?' said the email from the editor, although it probably had somewhat more potency before I coyly changed the word to 'hell'. Bizarrely, people hint at much the same question all the time, although few of them put it quite so starkly or are prepared to pay me to try and answer it. This is hardly a boast: were you in my position, they might do the same to you. They think I know something nobody else knows, that I've found the secret answer to a question which, through fear or embarrassment they can't quite bring themselves to ask. My position is this: I have an apparently terminal disease which doesn't allow me to make any realistic plans for more than a couple of months ahead, a voice which stopped when my cancerous tongue was removed, a diet entirely dependent on the food blender, and a fair to middling amount of pain on most days. To add insult to cancerous injury, I neither feel the need of nor can I discover any comfort in religious faith and I take refuge, legally or otherwise, in no more than the occasional dose of mind-nudging drugs. And yet most of the time, and within the usual limits, I seem to be happy, even - given my willingness to accept commissions like this one - smugly so. What, they want to know, is the trick? Well, yes, there's the nice house and the reasonable income from a cushy job that lets me show off in public the loving wife and family, the circle of supportive friends who indulge me in my various whims. To that extent, I suppose I have it all, or as much of it as it's possible to have under the circumstances. But those circumstances do make a difference: I might have it better than most tongueless terminal cases, but I know of no scale against which one can compare friends, family and possessions with the prospect of a long and healthy life. Would I swap a child or a friend or the family house for a new working tongue and a clear scan? Don't even ask, and not least because I'll never have to make the choice. But it's a fair assumption on the part of my inquisitors: with so little time left for living, what is there to live for?

      "body": "<p><strong>Susan Greenfield:</strong> My mother is very bright, but she was born into the sort of background where people didn't have access to education. Her father was a painter and builder during the war when there wasn't very much work. I was just very fortunate that she encouraged me all the time. She was never pushy, but her dictum was that you must always do what you want to do in life. </p> <p> My mother encouraged me to be a bit of a pioneer and gave me the ability to debunk things. She won a county scholarship to a girls' school in London which was a very big deal. She found it very snooty and ran away. I was sent to the same school because she said, 'It's a really intellectual snooty school, it'll just suit you.' </p> <p> A lot of my work is geared towards popularising science and a very happy spin-off of that is that my mother can understand a lot of the scientific work I do. She had been a chorus girl so she met a broad range of people. London working-class women of the 40s and 50s weren't known for their liberal attitudes, but the fact that she married my father, who's Jewish, speaks volumes for her open-minded nature. </p> <p> On rainy days we used to love looking at her photographs. Her time on the stage seemed like a fairy-tale world, all those fabulous costumes. She is still very glamorous. I've never seen her without make-up on or in casual clothes. It's something I've inherited, which is probably why I don't look like a typical scientist. </p> <p> I was given a lot more freedom than many of my middle-class friends. My mother made a great fuss of everything I did. When I was young she let me paint my bedroom in a lurid orange colour with black stick men marching across the wall. </p> <p> If anything good happens, she is the first person I tell. When I got my CBE, my first thought was, 'God, I can't wait to tell her she's coming to Buckingham Palace, she's going to love that.' She was crying down the phone when I told her and she cried when I received the Queen at the Royal Institution. </p> <p><strong>Doris Greenfield:</strong> It was obvious that Susan was clever when she went to school at the age of three and was already able to read.</p> <p> We've always been very close and accepting of each other for what we are. She's academic and I was a chorus girl, but she hasn't tried to turn me into a scientist and I didn't try to put her on the stage. </p> <p> I used to do her homework with her because I really loved maths. It's funny thinking back, but I should have known she'd end up working in science. I remember when she was learning how to work out how to convert from Fahrenheit to Centigrade. I made a table with all the calculations on for her bedroom wall to help her learn it. I've done a lot of groundwork with her since she was tiny, but, of course, she outgrew me. </p> <p> Susan's pet subject is the brain and she's researching something that might one day cure Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. She wrote one of her scientific books for the layman and dedicated it to Reg, her dad, and me because she knew that we would be able to understand this particular book. So that's got pride of place on the bookshelf. </p> <p> We really knew how to have fun together. I knew how to make clothes from my time on the stage, so we would go to the market or to Oxfam and buy material for me to make up her designs. I like to see people looking glamorous and she's always been like that since she was a child. I gave her her first lipstick when she was 13. </p> <p> Susan's made us feel like teenagers in our old age, giving us something to get up for in the morning. She takes me anywhere she can. We went to lunch at the Getty's house, but the most exciting day was when she got her CBE. When Prince Charles pinned the medal on her, I really wanted to clap and shout but I didn't dare. </p> <p> I never thought I'd see Susan go so far. I knew she was clever, and when she went to Oxford I said, 'You're going to end up being a don', but I never thought she'd end up with a professorship of pharmacology, a directorship and a CBE. I understand her not having children because she always has to give her best to what she's doing.</p>",

I was given a lot more freedom than many of my middle-class friends. My mother made a great fuss of everything I did. When I was young she let me paint my bedroom in a lurid orange colour with black stick men marching across the wall. If anything good happens, she is the first person I tell. When I got my CBE, my first thought was, 'God, I can't wait to tell her she's coming to Buckingham Palace, she's going to love that.' She was crying down the phone when I told her and she cried when I received the Queen at the Royal Institution. Doris Greenfield: It was obvious that Susan was clever when she went to school at the age of three and was already able to read. We've always been very close and accepting of each other for what we are. She's academic and I was a chorus girl, but she hasn't tried to turn me into a scientist and I didn't try to put her on the stage. I used to do her homework with her because I really loved maths. It's funny thinking back, but I should have known she'd end up working in science. I remember when she was learning how to work out how to convert from Fahrenheit to Centigrade. I made a table with all the calculations on for her bedroom wall to help her learn it. I've done a lot of groundwork with her since she was tiny, but, of course, she outgrew me. Susan's pet subject is the brain and she's researching something that might one day cure Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. She wrote one of her scientific books for the layman and dedicated it to Reg, her dad, and me because she knew that we would be able to understand this particular book. So that's got pride of place on the bookshelf. We really knew how to have fun together. I knew how to make clothes from my time on the stage, so we would go to the market or to Oxfam and buy material for me to make up her designs. I like to see people looking glamorous and she's always been like that since she was a child. I gave her her first lipstick when she was 13. Susan's made us feel like teenagers in our old age, giving us something to get up for in the morning. She takes me anywhere she can. We went to lunch at the Getty's house, but the most exciting day was when she got her CBE. When Prince Charles pinned the medal on her, I really wanted to clap and shout but I didn't dare. I never thought I'd see Susan go so far. I knew she was clever, and when she went to Oxford I said, 'You're going to end up being a don', but I never thought she'd end up with a professorship of pharmacology, a directorship and a CBE. I understand her not having children because she always has to give her best to what she's doing.",

For six years, since becoming editor of the Matlock Mercury , Hale has campaigned for the release of Stephen Downing, who, 27 years ago, was found guilty of murdering Wendy Sewell. Now that Downing looks set to be released on bail pending appeal in January, Hale is being applauded (the day after I spoke to him he was named Journalist of the Year by What the Papers Say). But the years of campaigning have been lonely and dangerous. He has been threatened, intimidated and derided: the police have been hostile; there have even been two attempts to kill him. </p> <p>Did he never feel like giving up, I ask? 'Oh well no. And I only had six years of carrying the torch. Stephen has held on for 27.' </p> <p>In 1973, Wendy Sewell, aged 32, was murdered in a graveyard in Bakewell, where Downing worked as the gardener. He was 17, but had the mental age of 11. He found Sewell as she lay dying, ran to get the police, even pointed out the pickaxe lying next to her. He was then taken to the police station and subjected to nine hours of interrogation, without a solicitor or a care worker. 'They kept on at him,' says Hale. 'He claims they shook him to keep him awake, they pulled his hair. Downstairs, they were taking bets as to who would get a confession out of him. Eight times, his parents tried to get to see him. The police told Stephen he wasn't to worry - Sewell was in a coma, and when she came round she could tell them who really did it. They told him to sign the confession and then he could go home. So the lad signed.' </p> <p>Wendy Sewell died, and Downing immediately retracted his confession; since then has steadfastly insisted on his innocence. He should have been released from prison 10 years ago, but because he was categorised IDOM (In Denial of Murder), was kept behind bars. He has just spent his twenty-eighth Christmas in prison, because the CPS botched the paperwork and refused him bail. </p> <p>Hale was first approached by Downing's parents, the other unsung heroes of the case. He started investigating and immediately 'knew there was something amiss'. He unearthed a very different story from the official one. Downing's confession was full of holes. There was no forensic evidence to link him to the murder. Witnesses had come forward to say they had seen another man fleeing from the graveyard, bloodstained, 'like a bat out of hell'. </p> <p>When Hale finally published his first story about the case, a slew of fresh witnesses came forward. 'The community knew he was innocent,' says Hale. 'There is in Bakewell a sense of collective guilt.' But they were also scared of helping Hale: many of them told him to come and see them, but to park his car in the next road or come after dark. Sewell had had many boyfriends, many of them married men, prominent in the area. People believe they know who the murderer is. Hale believes he knows. </p> <p>But if members of the community wanted to help Hale, others wanted to stop him. The paper 'wasn't exactly helpful', he says mildly. 'I think they wanted to move me on. And the national press probably thought I was barmy.' Prison officers were hostile: they swore at him, strip-searched him, tried to prevent his access to Downing. His mail was intercepted. A tap was put on his phone. He was once followed by a car and, when he checked its registration through a police contact, found that it belonged to either MI5 or CID. </p> <p>It becomes more dramatic. Hale was nearly run down by an unmarked car which came roaring at him on a dark night, headlights off. Months later, he was called out on a fake story and found himself in a country lane. A lorry came up behind him and bumped several times into the back of the car, trying to knock him off the road. As he rounded a bend, a second lorry was blocking his way.

      "body": "<p>Tonight, if not sooner, we raise a glass to our tomorrows, but what does the future hold for the drinker? According to the brave new world of Aldous Huxley, we are supposed to be stoned on an ancient Indian plant juice called soma. We came close a few years ago when the American brewer Miller test-marketed a beer containing guarana, an extract of the cocoa plant. Among its several effects, guarana is supposed to sober up the drinker. Perhaps for that reason, this potion did not sell.</p> <p>Bass, which used to be a brewing company, is planning to test-market a 'premium lager' (ie, 'it gets you drunk'), with guarana and caffeine. There is already a guarana 'energy drink' called Indigo.</p> <p>Drinks with flavour are a problem for the marketing man. One solution is to give all drinks a sugary-sweet fruitiness, as in alco-pops. The ultimate is to eliminate all flavours. This view might be said to colour marketeers' view of the future. Except that colour is often eliminated, too.</p> <p>Much exploratory work on the beers of the future has been done by the Miller Brewing Company. Its record of aberrant innovation goes back to Miller Lite. 'Like drinking wet air' was the verdict of one critic. To make this kind of beer, use as little barley malt as possible and ferment as far as feasible. Some brewers of 'light' beers help things along with industrial enzymes, or simply add water. Then came Miller Genuine Draft, sterile-filtered to remove any sign of life, and much of the flavour. Finally, there was Miller Clear Beer, filtered also to remove all colour. This one failed in test market.</p> <p>Remember 'dry' beer? And 'ice' beer? Such 'techno' beers tend to sweep all before them for three or four years, then fade. Whatever happened to the 'dry ice' beer predicted by cynics?</p> <p>The newest 'techno beer' in test market, again from Bass, is called Arc. It is served through a chiller at sub-zero celsius, at high pressure, which stops it freezing solid, though there are tiny ice crystals in the glass. Why so cold? Because cold beer tastes of nothing. My most chilling prediction for 2001: beer on a stick.</p> <p>Now is surely the time for someone to reveal the flavours of Romulan Ale, favoured by the bad guys in Star Trek . The good people drink 'Rigelian' brandy. As always, the grain is demonised and the grape elevated. Thank goodness for down-to-earth Scotty, and his occasional whisky.</p> <p>Even in 2001, this is the proper drink for New Year's Eve, and the continuing rise of malts is another good omen. After 'wood finishes' (in Port pipes or Madeira drums, for example) and 'cask strength' malts (alcohol by volume in 60s or 50s, rather than the usual 40s), the newest trend is vintage-dated bottling. I'm tempted to wonder whether the 2001 vintage of Glenmorangie will be plutonium-finished.</p> <p>What we flavour freaks want is yet more. We are looking forward to a Longrow whisky made entirely with the distillery's own pungently peated malt, but that is not due until 2002. As Longrow whisky is also distinctly briney, I wonder whether it might be used in the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, as featured in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy . The recipe for that drink includes 'one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus; Fallian marsh gas; and Arcturan Mega-gin'. In the book, the cocktail is favoured by the supreme egotist Zaphod Beeblebrox, who has two heads. After tonight's celebrations, we may all wake up tomorrow feeling similarly endowed.</p> <p>In honour of Thunderbirds ' return to terrestrial TV, Match Bar's Dick Bradsell has created an International Rescue cocktail. It's a bloody mary variant made with tomato juice, tequila, lime, orange and, dangerously, 'a dash of whatever gave you the hangover.' Or you could try:</p> <p><b> The Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster</b></p> <p>A less extreme version, culled from cyberspace: fill a Collins glass with ice. Add 2oz vodka and 1oz triple sec. Fill the glass almost to the top with pineapple juice. Add oz grenadine for colour, and top off the glass with 7-Up. Stir the drink until it turns orangey-pink.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tonight, if not sooner, we raise a glass to our tomorrows, but what does the future hold for the drinker? According to the brave new world of Aldous Huxley, we are supposed to be stoned on an ancient Indian plant juice called soma. We came close a few years ago when the American brewer Miller test-marketed a beer containing guarana, an extract of the cocoa plant. Among its several effects, guarana is supposed to sober up the drinker. Perhaps for that reason, this potion did not sell. Bass, which used to be a brewing company, is planning to test-market a 'premium lager' (ie, 'it gets you drunk'), with guarana and caffeine. There is already a guarana 'energy drink' called Indigo. Drinks with flavour are a problem for the marketing man. One solution is to give all drinks a sugary-sweet fruitiness, as in alco-pops. The ultimate is to eliminate all flavours. This view might be said to colour marketeers' view of the future. Except that colour is often eliminated, too. Much exploratory work on the beers of the future has been done by the Miller Brewing Company. Its record of aberrant innovation goes back to Miller Lite. 'Like drinking wet air' was the verdict of one critic. To make this kind of beer, use as little barley malt as possible and ferment as far as feasible. Some brewers of 'light' beers help things along with industrial enzymes, or simply add water. Then came Miller Genuine Draft, sterile-filtered to remove any sign of life, and much of the flavour. Finally, there was Miller Clear Beer, filtered also to remove all colour. This one failed in test market. Remember 'dry' beer? And 'ice' beer? Such 'techno' beers tend to sweep all before them for three or four years, then fade. Whatever happened to the 'dry ice' beer predicted by cynics? The newest 'techno beer' in test market, again from Bass, is called Arc. It is served through a chiller at sub-zero celsius, at high pressure, which stops it freezing solid, though there are tiny ice crystals in the glass. Why so cold? Because cold beer tastes of nothing. My most chilling prediction for 2001: beer on a stick. Now is surely the time for someone to reveal the flavours of Romulan Ale, favoured by the bad guys in Star Trek . The good people drink 'Rigelian' brandy. As always, the grain is demonised and the grape elevated. Thank goodness for down-to-earth Scotty, and his occasional whisky. Even in 2001, this is the proper drink for New Year's Eve, and the continuing rise of malts is another good omen. After 'wood finishes' (in Port pipes or Madeira drums, for example) and 'cask strength' malts (alcohol by volume in 60s or 50s, rather than the usual 40s), the newest trend is vintage-dated bottling. I'm tempted to wonder whether the 2001 vintage of Glenmorangie will be plutonium-finished. What we flavour freaks want is yet more. We are looking forward to a Longrow whisky made entirely with the distillery's own pungently peated malt, but that is not due until 2002. As Longrow whisky is also distinctly briney, I wonder whether it might be used in the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, as featured in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy . The recipe for that drink includes 'one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus; Fallian marsh gas; and Arcturan Mega-gin'. In the book, the cocktail is favoured by the supreme egotist Zaphod Beeblebrox, who has two heads. After tonight's celebrations, we may all wake up tomorrow feeling similarly endowed. In honour of Thunderbirds ' return to terrestrial TV, Match Bar's Dick Bradsell has created an International Rescue cocktail. It's a bloody mary variant made with tomato juice, tequila, lime, orange and, dangerously, 'a dash of whatever gave you the hangover.' Or you could try: The Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster A less extreme version, culled from cyberspace: fill a Collins glass with ice. Add 2oz vodka and 1oz triple sec. Fill the glass almost to the top with pineapple juice. Add oz grenadine for colour, and top off the glass with 7-Up. Stir the drink until it turns orangey-pink.",

      "body": "<p>George W. Bush faces a baptism of fire over his Latin America policy that will threaten the first days of his presidency next month. Responsibility will lie heavily on the shoulders of Condoleezza Rice, formerly his tutor in foreign affairs and now his National Security Adviser, as the political bombardment opens up on the White House from Colombia, Venezuela and Cuba.</p> <p>Next month a huge, much-criticised US military operation, Plan Colombia, will begin what is seen as the impossible task of stopping the production of marijuana, cocaine and heroin in the wildest country in the Western Hemisphere.</p> <p>Five hundred US troops are already in Colombia supporting an army which itself deals in drugs. This army's human rights record is as bad as any in the Balkans, Central or West Africa or Chile, and its collaboration with civilian death squads against left-wing guerrillas is routine and goes unpunished. On 21 December alone, 26 Colombian military and police personnel, including four colonels, were accused of collaboration in the massacre of civilians.</p> <p>Fighting between the army and guerrillas has forced up to 2 million Colombians from their homes in an exodus comparable to the calamities seen in Rwanda in the 1990s. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) were probably behind the murders on Friday of Diego Turbay, the Liberal Party chairman of the peace commission of the lower house, his mother and three bodyguards. They killed his brother three years ago.</p> <p>Former US Secretary of State George Shultz and the conservative economist Milton Friedman are among many now saying that the war on drugs, so dear to Bush, is causing more harm worldwide than drug abuse itself. Meanwhile, President Jorge Batlle of Uruguay is the first Latin American head of state to come out in favour of the legalisation of drugs. William Ratliff, from the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford, the university Rice herself used to run, argued last week that Plan Colombia was heading for crisis.</p> <p>Colin Powell, Bush's Secretary of State, Ratliff concluded, 'must have noticed the large and war-oriented US aid package to Colombia flies in the face of his own famed doctrine: clarity of objective, use of massive force, certainty of victory and exit strategy, and public support'.</p> <p>When the body bags start coming back from Colombia, and the cost of increased aid and of replaced equipment is understood, there will be popular protest in the US, he forecast. He might have added that Colombian violence started in 1948, decades before Colombia became a drugs exporter. But the arming of ill-disciplined and bloodthirsty soldiery continues in Colombia as it did in the 1980s in Central America.</p> <p>Just before Christmas the US government signed two contracts for 30 Black Hawk helicopters, of the type the guerrillas have already succeeded in shooting down, which should all be delivered next year. As if they sensed future casualties, the manufacturers said each helicopter could carry 'up to 11 fully outfitted troops or four stretchers'.</p> <p>For its part, Farc in its New Year's message threatens to 'defeat the evil war plans of the governments of the United States and Colombia'.</p> <p>Meanwhile in neighbouring Venezuela, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, himself a former paratroop colonel who enjoys great popular support, is perfecting the none too difficult art of infuriating Washington.</p> <p>He has refused US warplanes permission to fly over Venezuelan territory from their new bases in the Dutch Antilles. He is bitterly critical of Plan Colombia, as is Mireya Moscoso, the President of Panama, who has denied the Pentagon leave to reoccupy the former Canal Zone bases it gave up a year ago.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez has flown to visit President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad and Muammar Gadaffi in Tripoli. He has expressed his great admiration for President Fidel Castro on a visit to Havana and is supplying Cuba with the cheap oil it desperately needs.</p> <p>Most seriously for Bush, Venezuela, as the principal founder of Opec, has this month been able to nominate Ali Rodr\u00edguez, Ch\u00e1vez's former Oil Minister, as secretary-general of Opec in Vienna.

      "bodyText": "George W. Bush faces a baptism of fire over his Latin America policy that will threaten the first days of his presidency next month. Responsibility will lie heavily on the shoulders of Condoleezza Rice, formerly his tutor in foreign affairs and now his National Security Adviser, as the political bombardment opens up on the White House from Colombia, Venezuela and Cuba. Next month a huge, much-criticised US military operation, Plan Colombia, will begin what is seen as the impossible task of stopping the production of marijuana, cocaine and heroin in the wildest country in the Western Hemisphere. Five hundred US troops are already in Colombia supporting an army which itself deals in drugs. This army's human rights record is as bad as any in the Balkans, Central or West Africa or Chile, and its collaboration with civilian death squads against left-wing guerrillas is routine and goes unpunished. On 21 December alone, 26 Colombian military and police personnel, including four colonels, were accused of collaboration in the massacre of civilians. Fighting between the army and guerrillas has forced up to 2 million Colombians from their homes in an exodus comparable to the calamities seen in Rwanda in the 1990s. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) were probably behind the murders on Friday of Diego Turbay, the Liberal Party chairman of the peace commission of the lower house, his mother and three bodyguards. They killed his brother three years ago. Former US Secretary of State George Shultz and the conservative economist Milton Friedman are among many now saying that the war on drugs, so dear to Bush, is causing more harm worldwide than drug abuse itself. Meanwhile, President Jorge Batlle of Uruguay is the first Latin American head of state to come out in favour of the legalisation of drugs. William Ratliff, from the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford, the university Rice herself used to run, argued last week that Plan Colombia was heading for crisis. Colin Powell, Bush's Secretary of State, Ratliff concluded, 'must have noticed the large and war-oriented US aid package to Colombia flies in the face of his own famed doctrine: clarity of objective, use of massive force, certainty of victory and exit strategy, and public support'. When the body bags start coming back from Colombia, and the cost of increased aid and of replaced equipment is understood, there will be popular protest in the US, he forecast. He might have added that Colombian violence started in 1948, decades before Colombia became a drugs exporter. But the arming of ill-disciplined and bloodthirsty soldiery continues in Colombia as it did in the 1980s in Central America. Just before Christmas the US government signed two contracts for 30 Black Hawk helicopters, of the type the guerrillas have already succeeded in shooting down, which should all be delivered next year. As if they sensed future casualties, the manufacturers said each helicopter could carry 'up to 11 fully outfitted troops or four stretchers'. For its part, Farc in its New Year's message threatens to 'defeat the evil war plans of the governments of the United States and Colombia'. Meanwhile in neighbouring Venezuela, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, himself a former paratroop colonel who enjoys great popular support, is perfecting the none too difficult art of infuriating Washington. He has refused US warplanes permission to fly over Venezuelan territory from their new bases in the Dutch Antilles. He is bitterly critical of Plan Colombia, as is Mireya Moscoso, the President of Panama, who has denied the Pentagon leave to reoccupy the former Canal Zone bases it gave up a year ago. Ch\u00e1vez has flown to visit President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad and Muammar Gadaffi in Tripoli. He has expressed his great admiration for President Fidel Castro on a visit to Havana and is supplying Cuba with the cheap oil it desperately needs. Most seriously for Bush, Venezuela, as the principal founder of Opec, has this month been able to nominate Ali Rodr\u00edguez, Ch\u00e1vez's former Oil Minister, as secretary-general of Opec in Vienna. Venezuela, the main supplier of the fuel oil which keeps New York and other US cities warm in the winter, is not expected to do any favours for Bush, who faces the prospect of a serious slowdown in the US economy, by trying to keep the world oil price down. In addition, Jos\u00e9 Vicente Rangel, Ch\u00e1vez's Foreign Minister, has publicly challenged Washington to explain why $4 billion worth of marijuana is being grown in the US itself. Rumours are circulating that hawks in Washington are seeking allies within the Venezuelan mili tary for a coup d'\u00e9tat against Ch\u00e1vez. Were that to happen, the image of the 'Ugly American' would resurface worldwide. In comparison with the potential for yet more disaster in Colombia and Venezuela, Cuba is the least of the President-elect's worries. Yet it does present him with some ticklish problems. The Cuban exiles in Florida who did so much to win Bush the presidency have put the humiliation they suffered in the Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez crisis this year behind them. Newly confident, the exiles, and perhaps his brother Jeb Bush, Florida state governor, will be seeking some recompense from the new President, perhaps in the form of harsher measures against Castro. But if these are introduced it will upset the World Trade Organisation, the European Union, and many US businessmen. The businessmen are seeking to sign more, not fewer, deals with the largest island in the Caribbean where, despite shortages, tourism is expanding rapidly and where, in the absence of Uncle Sam for the past 40 years, the Canadians and Europeans are well entrenched. As a Russian specialist, Rice may not have the experience needed in Latin America but one of her skills may prove useful: she is an excellent ice-skater. She and Bush will need all her dexterity on the hard, slippery, unforgiving surface of US relations with the Latin Americans in 2001.",

Her Citroen Xsara rolled forward and trapped her under the wheels. Pensioner Ronald Webster of Blakenhall, West Midlands, died after suffering a heart attack while clearing snow from his drive. And in Cornwall a 14-year-old boy was seriously injured after being hit by a car while sledging on a snow-covered disused airfield at Davidstow.</p> <p>Fracture clinics around the country have reported an increase in cases.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of New Year travellers flying with the budget airline easyJet were facing chaos this weekend as staff struggled to clear a backlog that built up following heavy snow falls on Thursday. The shambles came as forecasters said Britain's freeze is set to continue wreaking havoc with more snow, followed by floods once the thaw sets in. Police were called to Luton and Liverpool airports in the early hours of yesterday to restore calm after more than 200 people were left stranded when the airline cancelled flights late on Friday. Around 100 staged a sit-in at an easyJet sales desk in Luton airport. The airline is based at Luton, which was closed following the heavy snow for most of Thursday, and accounts for 60 per cent of the airport's flights. One person was arrested at Liverpool, which was closed for most of yesterday because of ice, then freezing fog. Passengers flying from Belfast to Liverpool arrived yesterday after being stranded for two days. Would-be travellers complained of lack of information and food. One man, told by the low-cost airline to go home, replied: 'I live in Spain.' The company blamed a sub-contractor's failure to de-ice planes for the delays and said it had chartered extra flights. It promised compensation, but warned of further delays.'It is likely that many of the crews will be over their flying time limits by then, so there could be more problem,' a spokeswoman said. Weather forecasters said that heavy snow showers would pepper northern parts of the country today, with the chance of snow further south 'It is going to be horrible,' said a PA Weather Centre spokeswoman. She said it was difficult to tell when the band of weather would hit the country. 'By the time people go out, it will have started raining and it will be windy. It will be quite miserable.' She warned that the rain could turn to ice, making roads treacherous. The big freeze has already taken a toll. A 48-year-old woman who stopped on the A460 near Rugeley in Staffordshire to clear her windscreen was killed after a collision with a Vauxhall Astra driven by a 51-year-old man from Heath Hayes, Cannock. Her Citroen Xsara rolled forward and trapped her under the wheels. Pensioner Ronald Webster of Blakenhall, West Midlands, died after suffering a heart attack while clearing snow from his drive. And in Cornwall a 14-year-old boy was seriously injured after being hit by a car while sledging on a snow-covered disused airfield at Davidstow. Fracture clinics around the country have reported an increase in cases. In Lincolnshire, six people were hurt when an Alfa Romeo Spider sports car skidded on ice, ploughed into shoppers then smashed into a department store. New Year sales were badly hit, with shops reporting a drop of 50 per cent in turnover. With hundreds of road crashes being reported, police across the country warned motorists not to make non-essential journeys. The AA advised drivers to take blankets in case they got stuck in the snow. It was the AA's busiest day of the year with 3,000 call-outs an hour. The RAC also had record numbers of callers. Dozens of football matches were called off, including Premiership clashes between Aston Villa and Leicester City, Everton and Leeds United in England, and games between Celtic and Motherwell, Aberdeen and St Mirren and Kilmarnock and Rangers in Scotland. In Belfast, Rolf Harris and Jools Holland are preparing to perform outdoors in Arctic conditions at a New Year concert in the grounds of Belfast City Hall. The Met Office was predicting minus 10C in the province on New Year's Eve. Nationally, forecasters warned of sleet, snow and freezing rain on New Year's Eve. Snow is expected on higher ground in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and northern England with freezing rain in the Midlands and East Anglia. South-east England is expected to escape the worst, with any snowfall turning to rain later on New Year's night as temperatures rise. But the thaw threatens severe flooding as snow melts in some areas. Despite the current cold spell, this year will go down as one of the warmest and wettest in England since records began. It was the tenth warmest year in central England since temperature records began in 1659, with six of those 10 warm years occuring since 1989.",

      "bodyText": "The Ulster Volunteer Force was being blamed last night for the attempted murder of an associate of the late Billy Wright. Several shots were fired at the man - named locally as Ron Buchanan, a loyalist supporter in his mid-thirties from Portadown - who was sitting in a van on the Moy Road outside Portadown yesterday afternoon. He was hit several times, but according to the RUC his injuries are 'not life-threatening'. Reports suggested he was sitting in the van with Gary Fulton, a cousin of Mark Swinger Fulton, one of the founders of the Loyalist Volunteer Force. Three days ago Buchanan attended a memorial service for Wright at his graveside in Portadown's Seagoe Cemetery. Wright was shot dead inside the Maze prison on 27 December 1997 by INLA prisoners who had managed to smuggle a gun into what was meant to be a top-security jail. Local loyalist sources claim the UVF's Mid-Ulster Brigade carried out yesterday's shooting. Despite a truce on Belfast's Shankill Road between warring factions of the UDA and UVF, there has been no settlement of the year-long feud involving the UVF and the LVF. The attack comes nearly a year after the death of Richard Jameson, the UVF's Mid-Ulster Brigadier, who was shot dead by LVF gunmen outside his home. This latest shooting is bound to spark an escalation of the UVF-LVF feud, which has its origins in the expulsion of Wright - known as 'King Rat' - from the UVF during the disturbances at Drumcree in July 1996. Although they have established a working truce with the UDA following a vicious feud this summer, which claimed seven lives in west and north Belfast, the UVF leadership insists it will carry on its war against the much smaller LVF. Officially, the UDA has accepted the UVF's demands that the LVF cannot be included in the negotiations which ended the loyalist feud in greater Belfast. However, the attendance of large numbers of UDA members at the Wright memorial service last week indicates that many UDA activists still maintain close ties with the LVF. If they were to rush to its aid, this would create the danger of the UDA-UVF feud breaking out again.",

Lucasta Miller traces the evolution of the 'public personae' of Charlotte and Emily Bront\u00eb - from their implausible noms de plume, through vilifications and eulogies to their current 'images' as radical and mystic, respectively. Sister Anne is, by Miller's own admission, ignored because she never 'took on the mythic stature of her sisters in her own right'. Dipsomaniac Branwell is, brutally, but probably justly, discussed only when he 'impinged on Charlotte and Emily'. </p> <p>Miller's main concern is the process by which the 'truth' of a writer - the words she or he writes - gets drowned out by the chatterings of journals, little magazines, critical introductions and, more blaringly still, by the bowdlerisations of pop-lit - the tourist industry, Hollywood biopics, pop songs. Miller supplies a cultural materialist-ish unpicking of the heritage trade - that profitable network of writers' houses, coffee shops, souvenir shops selling Virginia Woolf fridge magnets and Bront\u00eb sisters jam. </p> <p>This trade thrives on snapshot caricatures and miniaturisations; its reserve currency is the bucolic idyll, the dying afternoon of the English summer - Shakespeare's quiet memorial in Stratford church, the expanses of lovely garden at Monk's House, Woolf's country residence. </p> <p>Miller supplies a deft and immaculately detailed tracing of the many 'constructions' of Charlotte Bront\u00eb, from her initial disguise as the elusive and haughty Currer Bell, to her tentative unveiling (and immediate censure as 'unfemininely' candid about Jane Eyre's passions and predilections), to the self-abnegating daughter of Mrs Gaskell's biography, The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb. </p> <p>She argues persuasively that Mrs Gaskell was responsible for the 'popular perception' of Charlotte as an angelic neurotic, trapped in the most remote moors with a capricious, violent father, disturbed from her writing by the clanging of church bells and the hammering of rain on her little, rustic window. </p> <p>Miller neatly documents the nineteenth-century boom in Charlotte worship - the first devotees at Haworth and the frantic requests for relics. Demand for snippets of her handwriting grew so persistent that the Bront\u00ebs' maligned father, Patrick, was forced to cut Charlotte's letters into tiny pieces, sending them out to fans as gnomic one-liners. </p> <p>Misinformers are trounced - Harriet Martineau and Mrs Gaskell for (Bront\u00eb's own complaint) deciding 'that I shall be a sort of invalid'; G. H. Lewes and Thackeray for deriving 'schoolboy amusement from the supposed naughtiness of her novels'; twentieth-century psycho-biographers such as Lucile Dooley for tediously diagnosing Charlotte as a neurotic with a father complex. </p> <p>Emily Bront\u00eb was, Miller suggests, obscure for longer than Charlotte. Wuthering Heights was generally dismissed as the freakish, unholy product of a terminally ill child. But she was secretly devoured by schoolgirl rebels of the 1890s and, later, by turn-of-the-century philosopher-novelists such as May Sinclair. Miller cites Sinclair as the originator of the 'Emily as mystic' myth - the pagan seer, skipping the moors in the company of her wild, bucking imagination, 'not a talented craftswoman but a being of rare spiritual gifts'. </p> <p>The novelist E. F. Benson, writing in 1932, 'hero-worshipped Emily in the religious language of mysticism'. Emily the mystic rebel became Emily the lesbian, a new 'image' first propounded in the 1930s by Virginia Moore and taken up again by Camille Paglia in Sexual Personae. Bront\u00eb's poems were ingeniously read for 'subtextual' Sapphic love. But, Miller suggests, all attempts fail; Emily Bront\u00eb is left 'the Sphinx of English literature', indifferent to posterity, writing for motives unknown. </p> <p>Miller tends to move seamlessly from the academic to the pop-biographical, from the souvenir shop to the literary life. Brief phrases in Radio Times are cited as sources of equal interest as the careful musings of Sinclair. </p> <p>This skitters over the question of whether different sources are variously trustworthy, whether some media are more likely to yield reliable information than others. It also leaves unresolved the question of whether all comment on writers is mythopoetic, or whether some particularly talented biographers and writers can occasionally stray towards the 'truth' about a writer. </p> <p>Certainly, Miller's antipathy to biography is palpable - she mistrusts its sliding into fiction, its phoney cries of disinterestedness. Biographers are, she suggests, never quite the altruistic detectives of authorial personality they claim to be. The question remaining is what you put in the place of personality analysis and myth-creation. The deconstructing critique towards which Miller strays should, taken to its logical conclusion, decide that any image of a writer is a despoiled hash of personal fixation or cultural archetype. But this is to leave us with nothing at all. So Miller suggests that we must cling to the works themselves as the final truth - the expression of the inner self, as opposed to the compromised external persona. </p> <p>The trouble with this argument is that it relies on readers communing properly, meaning innocently, with the works. If we can turn to the Bront\u00ebs and read them as they hoped to be read, draw their imaginative vision out pure and unsullied, then none of the image-making matters. Either we are always more incredulous than tourist boards would have us - knowing in our postmodernish fashion that nothing is quite as the forces of hard sell make it seem - or we are distracted by the bleats of the heritage racket, in which case our engagement with the works is already tainted. </p> <p>What comfort is there for the writer in all of this? Writers, from Miller's account, can hardly hope to control their images - the Bront\u00ebs, despite their initial reticence and despite Charlotte's intervention in the literary reputation of Emily, failed to exert an abiding force over the powers of caricature and moneymaking. Miller so thoroughly enforces the argument for the interference of reviewers, academics and film directors in the reading process that her final point, that the works will always out, is not as consoling as it should be. </p> <p>In the cultural world Miller has supplied, biopic will traduce, however secretive and controlling writers try to be, and readers of Wuthering Heights will struggle at every line against recollections of Kate Bush screeching in a flimsy white robe or Laurence Olivier marching through the gorse.</p>",

Miller so thoroughly enforces the argument for the interference of reviewers, academics and film directors in the reading process that her final point, that the works will always out, is not as consoling as it should be. In the cultural world Miller has supplied, biopic will traduce, however secretive and controlling writers try to be, and readers of Wuthering Heights will struggle at every line against recollections of Kate Bush screeching in a flimsy white robe or Laurence Olivier marching through the gorse.",

      "body": "<p>As the world recovered from its millennium party, it became clear that computer systems had resisted the Y2K computer bug. On New Year's Day 2000 we awoke to bank accounts intact and investment portfolios unscathed. </p> <p> The first heroes of the year, therefore, were the information technology experts, who prepared so thoroughly for the turn of the millennium. Questions were raised about money spent on Y2K-proofing - but, on balance, it was probably money well spent. </p> <p> Building societies continued to demonstrate the benefits of mutuality, particularly for borrowers. This was confirmed in a survey published just before Christmas by rate-tracking service Moneyfacts. Building societies occupy seven of the top 10 places in a league table of the cheapest lenders for a \u00a350,000 variable-rate loan over 12 months. In most cases these rates apply to longer-standing borrowers - recognition by the societies of loyalty. </p> <p>But building societies don't have a monopoly on good value: Moneyfacts points out that Standard Life and Direct Line charge the same relatively low rates to all borrowers, regardless of how long they have been on the lender's books. Both lenders feature in the top 10, so deserve end-of-year prizes. </p> <p>Skipton building society deserves a mention for handing out to members the \u00a350 million profit it made on the sale of share dealing subsidiary Dealwise in the form of special bonuses worth up to \u00a31,000. </p> <p>Banks and other financial companies do not launch new products for the glory of it. But truly innovative products can do their customers a favour - and the past 12 months have brought some innovation. The Halifax's new subsidiary, Intelligent Finance, launched an account that recognises a nonsense in the way many people handle their finances. If you are paying more to borrow on a credit card, or even a mortgage, than you are receiving on savings, it does not make sense to have savings. But many people like to have a bit put aside for emergencies, and IF deals with the contradiction by 'crediting' savings against borrowing, thus reducing interest costs. This is not the first or only product to promote 'connectivity', but IF's high profile has helped to spread the word. </p> <p>Certain charities stand out for their campaigning on financial issues. The Consumers' Association has championed several causes, the most recent being that of policyholders with insurer Axa, whom CA believes have been shortchanged in the insurer's plan for dividing up surplus or 'orphan' assets. </p> <p>Age Concern and Help the Aged have both campaigned on pensioners' behalf over the pitiful basic state pension. This work has helped convince the Government that pensioners are a force in the electorate worth listening to. </p> <p> The dedicated individuals who set up and run credit unions deserve recognition. These savings and loans 'clubs' which offer low-cost loans are gathering strength: figures published before Christmas by the Registry of Friendly Societies show a 16 per cent increase in members by the end of 1999. </p> <p>The internet continued to bring mainly benefits for users. While several sites folded, the internet remained a source of competitive deals in mortgages, savings and insurance. It continues to put pressure on traditional financial organisations. Online stockbroking services introduced large numbers of people to share trading for the first time this year. </p> <p>The new enthusiasm for share trading boosted longer-established brokers too. One, The Share Centre, run by \"people's capitalist\" Gavin Oldham, earns a merit award for giving free shares to customers who helped to put the business on the map. The Share Centre followed up this move by being among the first companies to launch one of the Government's new employee share ownership schemes; free shares were given to workers. </p> <p>Don Cruickshank, the former telecommunications regulator who now heads the Stock Exchange, is a prizewinner in 2000 for taking on the banks in his temporary role as leader of a special inquiry into the banking industry. He concluded that customers were being overcharged by about \u00a35 billion a year. The Cruickshank report led to the announcement before Christmas by the Government of a new watchdog to clamp down on credit card and other money transmission charges levied on retailers by banks. </p> <p>Cruickshank also waded into the row over cash machine charges, helping to push the banks into submission; most will scrap the charges from the new year. Cruickshank said it should be easier to move accounts from one bank to another, and this ensured that the banks speeded up plans to introduce an electronic direct debit switching service. A pilot scheme is now getting under way, and all banks should be participating by this time next year. In addition, banks are obliged under a revamped code of banking practice - coming into effect tomorrow (1 January) - to cooperate in helping customers move. </p> <p>Other changes in the code - such as a requirement to give at least eight weeks - notice of a branch closure, and to warn on-screen of any charges on cash machine withdrawals - are responses to other controversies that engulfed banks during 2000 and put their industry collectively near the bottom of class. </p> <p>Even newcomers to the business, notably internet banks such as Egg, First-E, Smile and Cahoot have failed to live up to all expectations because of technical difficulties and, in some cases, security problems. But they all get a big E for effort. They offer better value than the traditional banks. </p> <p>Many banks and building societies deserve an 'F'-for-failure mark for trapping customers in Tessa savings accounts offering lower rates than the successor scheme, the Isa. The Banking Ombudsman issued instructions to ensure savers were protected but some banks, even big names such as Abbey National, seemed peeved at the ruling. </p> <p>Motorists have been hit by increases in premiums averaging more than 20 per cent for comprehensive cover, for which the industry is blaming a host of difficulties other than any perpetrated by itself. </p> <p>But the life insurance industry is where there has been the most misbehaviour this year. Equitable Life has closed to new business in a crisis that was apparently unforeseen by its management or the regulators. The Equitable disaster, which has shocked the insurance industry, continues to unfold. Axa deserves no prizes for the complexity of the scheme it dreamt up to distribute surplus, or 'orphan' assets. The Court may have sanctioned it, despite a challenge from the Consumers' Association, but few policyholders can have understood what they were being offered. </p> <p>Of much wider concern has been the realisation that up to 4 million people may face shortfalls on their endowment mortgages. The insurance industry was forced by its regulator to face up to the potential problem by reviewing all policies and writing to homeowners to update them. But the regulator and the industry continue to brush aside allegations of widespread mis-selling. </p> <p>Anecdotal evidence suggests that many borrowers were given far too optimistic a view about how their endowments would perform. One insurer earns marks for effort this year, however. Standard Life pulled up its socks after fighting off an attempt by policyholders to force it to demutualise. Most notable of its pro-mutual initiatives, perhaps, is its promise to make good any shortfalls on endowment policies provided investments grow by 6 per cent a year. Given that the insurer did not start sending out letters warning its borrowers about shortfalls until after the demutualisation vote had taken place, this may seem the least it could do. But this is a worthwhile guarantee for worried homeowners. Similar gestures from other insurers would be welcome. </p> <p>Some new credit card operators, such as Egg and Capital One, earn some points for their effort in developing innovative and competitive deals. But the deals are also becoming increasingly complicated, with pitfalls for the unwary. Anecdotal evidence from debt counsellors also suggests that card companies are being far too liberal in handing out cards and upping credit limits. The Government has set up a task force to investigate. </p> <p>Some retailers, including Comet, get an 'F' for failure for the so-called interest free credit they offer. If borrowers miss their final payments by just a few days, they may be charged up to nearly 30 per cent for all the months they thought were interest-free. There is nothing unlawful about the deals, but the Office of Fair Trading has expressed its concern. </p> <p> The Government deserves an end-of-year report of its own. Its efforts in 'helping' us with our finances have had mixed results. Generally its intentions have been good, but its solutions were often overly complicated. The pensioners' credit for example, announced in Gordon Brown's pre-Budget report, aims to ensure that people who have saved small amounts for retirement do not lose means-tested benefits. But the scheme is unlikely to be understood by many, if any, of those it aims to help. </p> <p>The idea that the DSS could run a scheme of complex credits seemed laughable at a time when its computer systems were already delivering miscalculated state pensions to tens of thousands of people every year. </p> <p>The Government did drag its feet in putting right a scandal over widows' pensions from the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme. This problem had its roots in the previous Tory administration, but the Labour government tried a penny-pinching approach to sorting it out, before giving in last month and announcing that people who reach retirement age by 6 October 2002 will keep their full spouse's Serps entitlement. For others, the new system will be phased in over 10 years. </p> <p>Government action to bring down the price of cars was also criticised for its narrow approach, but the car industry seems to have taken note of consumer anger over high UK prices, and there has been steep discounting.</p>",
