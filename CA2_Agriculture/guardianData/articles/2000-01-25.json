Yet, as he showed once again in Bloemfontein on Sunday, when he took four wickets and the individual award, this is still a match winner, a man capable not only of raising his game but of galvanising those around him with a mischievous medley of skidding pace, reverse swing, off-cutters and sheer personality. </p> <p>After the Test series Gough had raged and raged against the dying of the light. He said then: \"I charged in every time. People said I'd lost my sparkle and bounce. But I bowled the same this winter as I did last winter. I haven't had the breaks.\" </p> <p>This reeked of self-delusion. This winter he has not looked match-fit, and some wise observers even questioned his usually impeccable attitude. </p> <p>Yesterday, though, there was a little realism in his voice as he came to terms with the fact that he is no longer England's champion fast bowler. </p> <p>\"I've got a good record in Test cricket, with 139 wickets, and in one-day internationals with 112. Not many people have done that and I deserve some respect. But if someone asks me who is the best fast bowler in the country, I'd say Andy Caddick.\" He had not said that when he arrived back from Australia last year. </p> <p>Gough feels that one-day cricket represents his best chance of getting back to the bowler he was before his four-month lay-off last summer because of a calf injury. </p> <p>\"People say you need to bowl overs to be at your best, but for me the best way is to play a lot of one-day cricket. </p> <p>\"You need to bowl under pressure at the start, to bowl back of a length and straight, to come back and mix it up at the end and come back again and bowl yorkers. </p> <p>\"Anyone can bowl bouncers. But in one-day cricket you need discipline and line and length. You need to use your brain and vary it. </p> <p>\"Against South Africa on Sunday I went back to my old, shorter run for the first time in 18 months. It was my idea. Everyone was telling me I should use the longer one. Suddenly everything went smooth. I felt good rhythm. </p> <p>\"I also used a lot of slower balls. So did Caddy, who doesn't normally bowl them, and Craig White. The thing about a slower ball is that you have to change it to keep one move ahead, otherwise they will pick it. I've got an off-cutter and a leg-break. I've also got a new one, which I will be trying in the nets but I'm not too confident of using it in a match. </p> <p>\"I love one-day cricket. It will always be my preference over Test matches. We were a decent one-day side but we've drifted in the past couple of years. We play a lot of it at home but seem behind at international level.\" </p> <p>Gough is one of only four men here who played in England's last World Cup match, against India in Birmingham in June. \"I feel it's a compliment that people think I might be around in 2003 to play in the next World Cup,\" he said.

      "body": "<p>The players' lounge at White Hart Lane is the place you would least expect to find a shopping list being drawn up for Tottenham's chairman Sir Alan Sugar. Fill the place with supporters, though, and the club's need for a new striker is bound to get an airing. </p> <p>It was the Tottenham fans' turn to talk to a deputation of senior Premier League officials, including for good measure the chief executive Richard Scudamore, who inspected for the first time the work his organisation is doing to gauge the opinions of its customers across the land. </p> <p>The gathering's central theme was the treatment of families at Premier League clubs and the 26 invitees - 12 parents and 14 children - were more inclined to discuss concessions, facilities, atmosphere and the effect of television than whether Sugar should open his chequebook for a Rivaldo or Ronaldo. The fans saved that for later in the day after Sheffield Wednesday had beaten Spurs. </p> <p>It is the sixth season that groups of supporters have met Premier League bigwigs, discussions which are rarely open to the media, and Scudamore views them as a vital part of the league's agenda. </p> <p>\"They are excellent,\" he said on Saturday. \"They start slowly, everybody wonders why they are here and then after another five minutes they are raging away and are difficult to stop. </p> <p>\"It has to be right to hold these forums. We hear the voices of fans all the time but I think it's absolutely right that the league and the clubs should want to sit down with them in the right environment and get them to open up and really hear their concerns. </p> <p>These focus groups run alongside the fan survey carried out by John Williams of the Sir Norman Chester Centre for Football Research. Come season's end the views gathered will be collated into a report. An impossible task? Paul Johns, who set up the panels, says not. </p> <p>\"We write a report which outlines the views about which there was a consensus, and then other ideas which we believe worth considering. Just because an idea has only been suggested by one fan does not mean it is not worth listening to.\" </p> <p>In the past few years, as a result of views expressed at the meetings - there is one per club per season - all Premier League clubs are now obliged to offer concessions to away fans, poster campaigns on the use of abusive language have been launched and away fans are guaranteed a specific allocation of seats at every ground. </p> <p>Should some of Saturday's debates influence policy, allocated singing areas will become commonplace, children will be encouraged through reduced prices and by meetings with players, and information during a game will be more available. </p> <p>\"Not everything goes into the 'do-able' pile\", Scudamore said, \"but the consumer liaison side is something which has to be vigorously supported and when we get the chairmen together we have to spend time making sure that they do take notice of these kind of issues. </p> <p>\"It makes good business sense. When you look at the 20 chairmen of the clubs, they are all successful businessmen and at some point in their careers they have been making customers happy day in, day-out. It's not that much different when it comes to football.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The players' lounge at White Hart Lane is the place you would least expect to find a shopping list being drawn up for Tottenham's chairman Sir Alan Sugar. Fill the place with supporters, though, and the club's need for a new striker is bound to get an airing. It was the Tottenham fans' turn to talk to a deputation of senior Premier League officials, including for good measure the chief executive Richard Scudamore, who inspected for the first time the work his organisation is doing to gauge the opinions of its customers across the land. The gathering's central theme was the treatment of families at Premier League clubs and the 26 invitees - 12 parents and 14 children - were more inclined to discuss concessions, facilities, atmosphere and the effect of television than whether Sugar should open his chequebook for a Rivaldo or Ronaldo. The fans saved that for later in the day after Sheffield Wednesday had beaten Spurs. It is the sixth season that groups of supporters have met Premier League bigwigs, discussions which are rarely open to the media, and Scudamore views them as a vital part of the league's agenda. \"They are excellent,\" he said on Saturday. \"They start slowly, everybody wonders why they are here and then after another five minutes they are raging away and are difficult to stop. \"It has to be right to hold these forums. We hear the voices of fans all the time but I think it's absolutely right that the league and the clubs should want to sit down with them in the right environment and get them to open up and really hear their concerns. These focus groups run alongside the fan survey carried out by John Williams of the Sir Norman Chester Centre for Football Research. Come season's end the views gathered will be collated into a report. An impossible task? Paul Johns, who set up the panels, says not. \"We write a report which outlines the views about which there was a consensus, and then other ideas which we believe worth considering. Just because an idea has only been suggested by one fan does not mean it is not worth listening to.\" In the past few years, as a result of views expressed at the meetings - there is one per club per season - all Premier League clubs are now obliged to offer concessions to away fans, poster campaigns on the use of abusive language have been launched and away fans are guaranteed a specific allocation of seats at every ground. Should some of Saturday's debates influence policy, allocated singing areas will become commonplace, children will be encouraged through reduced prices and by meetings with players, and information during a game will be more available. \"Not everything goes into the 'do-able' pile\", Scudamore said, \"but the consumer liaison side is something which has to be vigorously supported and when we get the chairmen together we have to spend time making sure that they do take notice of these kind of issues. \"It makes good business sense. When you look at the 20 chairmen of the clubs, they are all successful businessmen and at some point in their careers they have been making customers happy day in, day-out. It's not that much different when it comes to football.\"",

Aunt Petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger sticking out. Harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom, but he met Uncle Vernon's angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it out. </p> <p> \"Aah,\" said Aunt Marge, smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy glass back down. \"Excellent nosh, Petunia. It's normally just a fry-up for me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after. . . .\" She burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach. \"Pardon me. But I do like to see a healthy-sized boy,\" she went on, winking at Dudley. \"You'll be a proper-sized man, Dudders, like your father. Yes, I'll have a spot more brandy, Vernon. . . .\" </p> <p> \"Now, this one here -\" </p> <p> She jerked her head at Harry, who felt his stomach clench. The Handbook, he thought quickly. </p> <p> \"This one's got a mean, runty look about him. You get that with dogs. I had Colonel Fubster drown one last year. Ratty little thing it was. Weak. Underbred.\" </p> <p> Harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book: A Charm to Cure Reluctant Reversers. </p> <p> \"It all comes down to blood, as I was saying the other day. Bad blood will out. Now, I'm saying nothing against your family, Petunia\" - she patted Aunt Petunia's bony hand with her shovel-like one - \"but your sister was a bad egg. They turn up in the best families. Then she ran off with a wastrel and here's the result right in front of us.\" </p> <p> Harry was staring at his plate, a funny ringing in his ears. Grasp your broom firmly by the tail, he thought. But he couldn't remember what came next. Aunt Marge's voice seemed to be boring into him like one of Uncle Vernon's drills. </p> <p>\"This Potter,\" said Aunt Marge loudly, seizing the brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth, \"you never told me what he did?\" </p> <p> Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking extremely tense. Dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents. </p> <p> \"He - didn't work,\" said Uncle Vernon, with half a glance at Harry. \"Unemployed.\" </p> <p> \"As I expected!\" said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve. \"A no-account, good-for-nothing, lazy scrounger who -\" </p> <p> \"He was not,\" said Harry suddenly. The table went very quiet. Harry was shaking all over. He had never felt so angry in his life. </p> <p>\"MORE BRANDY!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very white. He emptied the bottle into Aunt Marge's glass. \"You, boy,\" he snarled at Harry. \"Go to bed, go on -\" </p> <p> \"No, Vernon,\" hiccuped Aunt Marge, holding up a hand, her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on Harry's. \"Go on, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, are you? They go and get themselves killed in a car crash (drunk, I expect) -\" </p> <p> \"They didn't die in a car crash!\" said Harry, who found himself on his feet. </p> <p> \"They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to be a burden on their decent, hardworking relatives!\" screamed Aunt Marge, swelling with fury. \"You are an insolent, ungrateful little -\" </p> <p> But Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a moment, it looked as though words had failed her. She seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger - but the swelling didn't stop. Her great red face started to expand, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech - next second, several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls - she was inflating like a monstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband, each of her fingers blowing up like a salami - </p> <p> \"MARGE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia together as Aunt Marge's whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling. She was entirely round, now, like a vast lifebuoy with piggy eyes, and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air, making apoplectic popping noises. Ripper came skidding into the room, barking madly. </p> <p> \"NOOOOOOO!\" </p> <p> \u0095 Extracted from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban by JK Rowling, \u00a9 JK Rowling, published by Bloomsbury</p>",

Harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom, but he met Uncle Vernon's angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it out. \"Aah,\" said Aunt Marge, smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy glass back down. \"Excellent nosh, Petunia. It's normally just a fry-up for me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after. . . .\" She burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach. \"Pardon me. But I do like to see a healthy-sized boy,\" she went on, winking at Dudley. \"You'll be a proper-sized man, Dudders, like your father. Yes, I'll have a spot more brandy, Vernon. . . .\" \"Now, this one here -\" She jerked her head at Harry, who felt his stomach clench. The Handbook, he thought quickly. \"This one's got a mean, runty look about him. You get that with dogs. I had Colonel Fubster drown one last year. Ratty little thing it was. Weak. Underbred.\" Harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book: A Charm to Cure Reluctant Reversers. \"It all comes down to blood, as I was saying the other day. Bad blood will out. Now, I'm saying nothing against your family, Petunia\" - she patted Aunt Petunia's bony hand with her shovel-like one - \"but your sister was a bad egg. They turn up in the best families. Then she ran off with a wastrel and here's the result right in front of us.\" Harry was staring at his plate, a funny ringing in his ears. Grasp your broom firmly by the tail, he thought. But he couldn't remember what came next. Aunt Marge's voice seemed to be boring into him like one of Uncle Vernon's drills. \"This Potter,\" said Aunt Marge loudly, seizing the brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth, \"you never told me what he did?\" Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking extremely tense. Dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents. \"He - didn't work,\" said Uncle Vernon, with half a glance at Harry. \"Unemployed.\" \"As I expected!\" said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve. \"A no-account, good-for-nothing, lazy scrounger who -\" \"He was not,\" said Harry suddenly. The table went very quiet. Harry was shaking all over. He had never felt so angry in his life. \"MORE BRANDY!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very white. He emptied the bottle into Aunt Marge's glass. \"You, boy,\" he snarled at Harry. \"Go to bed, go on -\" \"No, Vernon,\" hiccuped Aunt Marge, holding up a hand, her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on Harry's. \"Go on, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, are you? They go and get themselves killed in a car crash (drunk, I expect) -\" \"They didn't die in a car crash!\" said Harry, who found himself on his feet. \"They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to be a burden on their decent, hardworking relatives!\" screamed Aunt Marge, swelling with fury. \"You are an insolent, ungrateful little -\" But Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a moment, it looked as though words had failed her. She seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger - but the swelling didn't stop. Her great red face started to expand, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech - next second, several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls - she was inflating like a monstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband, each of her fingers blowing up like a salami - \"MARGE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia together as Aunt Marge's whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling. She was entirely round, now, like a vast lifebuoy with piggy eyes, and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air, making apoplectic popping noises. Ripper came skidding into the room, barking madly. \"NOOOOOOO!\" \u0095 Extracted from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban by JK Rowling, \u00a9 JK Rowling, published by Bloomsbury",

The passions she evoked were returning, if not to \"plague the inventor\", then to trouble and perhaps inspire her in her turn.</p> <p>All over the hall people were staring at her. She could hardly mistake their glances; Paris audiences had long ceased to show her that kind of attention - not since the great days of 1827 and 1828 had she been the object of such excitement. Though her knowledge of French was as yet sketchy she knew enough to grasp the gist of the literary programme she held in her hand, even without the thinly veiled allusions of Maurice Schlesinger, and the English Journalist Schutter, to the emotional origins of the work. If there was still any doubt who its heroine was, none was possible when in the sequel to the symphony she heard Bocage, the actor who took the role of the composer-hero, speak of his longing for \"Juliet, the Ophelia that my heart cries out for\". From that moment \"she felt the room reel about her; she heard no more, but sat in a dream, and at the end went home like a sleepwalker, hardly aware of what was happening\". The words are Berlioz's, not Harriet's, but there is no reason to think them exaggerated. As Peter Raby remarks, it is not everyone who is wooed by a full orchestra.</p> <p>For Berlioz it brought five years of disdain and indifference to an abrupt end. His life was revolutionised. Even the revenge against F\u00e9tis, target of Bocage's fiercest tirade, was forgotten. Within hours Miss Smithson had sent him her congratulations on his success. Next day he was granted permission to be introduced to her and they met. From now on he called every evening the English company was not performing. When he could not see her he wrote, in French, and she answered in English. Less than a week after the concert, \"like Othello\" he was telling her the story of his life since the day he had first set eyes on her, and she was weeping. \"You can imagine with what intoxication I saw her tears flow.\" On 18 December, scarcely able to believe it, he heard her say, \"Eh bien, Berlioz ... je vous aime\": his feelings were answered at last. It did not matter that hers were not of the same intensity as his, but rather - he told his sister Nancy - \"feelings which combine love, friendship and gratitude\". The agonising hopelessness was over and past. She loved him.</p> <p>Yet it was not till nine and a half months later, after a series of delays only partly external in origin, that they were married. Looking back on it many years later, Berlioz recalled it as a time of continual, almost unbearable agitation in his life; he was alternately \"elated with wild hopes and racked with fearful apprehensions\". The course of true love never ran less smooth.</p> <p>During those fraught, protracted months they did not become lovers, though gossip assumed they were. Whatever he may have desired, to her it would have been unthinkable. Her reserve often drove him to distraction - even his most restrained caresses alarmed her - yet at the same time he admired it and marvelled to find such innocence in a woman whose whole life had been lived in the theatre. It was bitterly ironic, he told his father, that Dr Berlioz should consent to his engagement to Camille Moke, a thoroughly promiscuous woman (as he had since discovered), but should oppose his marrying Harriet Smithson, whose behaviour had always been irreproachable.</p> <p>The family's opposition was the first obstacle. Berlioz did not break the news to his father until the beginning of February, nearly eight weeks after he had begun courting Harriet; but Nancy's reply to an earlier letter in which he opened his heart to her (as in the old days) gave a taste of what the reaction would be. She dismissed it as a passing fancy, adding a warning - like Germont p\u00e9re in La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias - that such an alliance would jeopardize Ad\u00e9Ie's chance of making a good marriage.</p> <p>As actress, Protestant and penniless woman, Miss Smithson was trebly obnoxious. F\u00e9lix Marmion, who was in Paris (Berlioz watched him parade down the boulevard at the head of his regiment on 23 January), characteristically fastened on this last objection. It was not even a speculation on his nephew's part, he wrote to Nancy: \"the actress is ruined\". Colonel Marmion pinned his hopes on certain \"information\" about Miss Smithson, which according to Alphonse Robert had reached Hector and was causing him to think again.

Berlioz's C\u00f4tols friend Edouard Rocher hints darkly to him about \"fears\" - presumably as to Harriet's virtue - which the inquiries of \"well-informed persons\" have confirmed.) In the second week of February Marmion took himself to the minor theatre in the Rue Chantereine where the English company had been playing for the past month, and sent a report to Nancy next day.</p> <blockquote> \"I was very curious to analyse the potent charms which have wrought such havoc.

And I needed a symbol to show that I wasn't who people kept insisting I was.</p> <p>I didn't know when I first saw Veronica that she was my ticket out of there.

I could actually feel the money on me like the touch of some strange, fragrant oil. I felt like I could get exactly what I wanted, what money demanded. Because money isn't paper and metal and plastic and bank statements. It's a feeling, like everything else.</p> <p>The buzzer buzzed and I let her into the flat, which was small and grubby and badly overpriced. This was not something only I could see; I knew she would see it too. David Blunkett would be able to see it, on a dark night. That's the point. She's not meant to buy this one - this is part of the psychological softening up that one has to undergo, as a punter. It's about lowering expectations. So that when we finally show anything half or even quarter decent, it'll look like the bargain of a lifetime. On such matters as the psychology of need and diminishment of self, we could advise Mossad.</p> <p>She was class, I could see that from the moment she walked in the room. Manolo Blahnik shoes, a little black and white Bardot dress which I would guess was Agn\u00e9s B, short-cut Peter Pan hair, shocking red. Five five, slightly shorter than me, not bad-looking but more Zoe Ball than Eva Herzigova. A kind of stretched face, as if the bones were trying to get out, with soft cottony skin. I liked her nose particularly, kind of fleshy, as if God had thrown a lump of dough at the centre of her face instead of designing one just for a bit of a giggle, or perhaps because he was bored. A fat nose then, but cute. The eyes were slightly mismatched - one larger than the other - but they had those lazy, heavy eyelids that always hinted at a powerful libido. Very slim too, with long, terrific legs. Flat-chested, but I'm very liberated about such matters. Looked her age, but not older than. She was certainly in her late twenties, possibly early thirties.</p> <p>Posh, but not too much so - maybe two rungs above me, but not three. Three is too many to jump. I'm realistic about these things. I'm an estate agent - you learn to be realistic. You learn the value of things, you learn about people with an inflated idea of themselves. They come in the office every day, flakes we call them, or mincers, asking to look at places they can't afford, salivating over fixtures and fittings that cost more than their entire credit rating, drooling at the prospect of something somewhere in the future that will make them feel like they're in a television ad or a copy of Vogue Decor. It's not realistic. There's a ceiling.</p> <p>Now Veronica was right there, at the ceiling. Touchable if you balanced on tiptoe. She spoke well, but not cut-glass or anything. You definitely can't jump too far in terms of class. You get young and old together, black and white, ugly and handsome, rich and poor. But it's still practically unheard of, in England, for the classes to cross the great divide - at least in my experience. Me and Veronica were definitely pushing the limits, but it was just about on the cards.</p> <p>So. She was attractive, not beautiful. On the turn, a bit of a retread, probably just broken up a long-term relationship and getting very slightly worried about her prospects. I checked her watch: Raymond Weil, mid-range, too new to be inherited.</p> <p>From the flat she was looking at, I could infer that she was well heeled, but not stinking rich. I guessed she was educated from the book she was carrying with her when she came in - something by Virginia Woolf. I could also tell from the fact that it was dog-eared in three places in the first ten pages that she was reading it out of a sense of duty rather than enjoyment, which was fine with me. That meant she was a woman who understood that appearances matter.</p> <p>I did the obvious - asked whether it was for her and her boyfriend (no, they'd just split up), whether she'd be living alone (yes, but no archness in the reply, no flirt). She told me her name was Vronky, which I thought I had misheard, until she explained it was short for Veronica, Veronica Tree.</p> <p>'We're distantly related to the Beerbohm Trees, don't you know?' she murmured, saying the last three words mock-posh, ultra-posh, as if it was a joke, but underneath I could tell she was proud of it. And although I didn't have the faintest idea who the Bare Bumtrees were, I was impressed.</p> <p>She hummed and hawed her way round the flat. and I could tell she wasn't keen, which established a ground-floor intelligence. But then, Vinnie Jones with a head injury ...</p> <p>I told her what she already knew, that she didn't want this flat, that we get a lot better than this for the same price, that the freeholder was an old villain and that she shouldn't touch it with a bargepole. Again, part of the softening-up process. Get them to trust you. Get them to like you. If they're a woman, get them into bed if possible, but only after you've closed the deal. I'm a closer, me. I always close. </p> <p>\u0095 Extracted from White City Blue by Tim Lott, \u00a9 Tim Lott 1999, published by Penguin Books</p>",

Five five, slightly shorter than me, not bad-looking but more Zoe Ball than Eva Herzigova. A kind of stretched face, as if the bones were trying to get out, with soft cottony skin. I liked her nose particularly, kind of fleshy, as if God had thrown a lump of dough at the centre of her face instead of designing one just for a bit of a giggle, or perhaps because he was bored. A fat nose then, but cute. The eyes were slightly mismatched - one larger than the other - but they had those lazy, heavy eyelids that always hinted at a powerful libido. Very slim too, with long, terrific legs. Flat-chested, but I'm very liberated about such matters. Looked her age, but not older than. She was certainly in her late twenties, possibly early thirties. Posh, but not too much so - maybe two rungs above me, but not three. Three is too many to jump. I'm realistic about these things. I'm an estate agent - you learn to be realistic. You learn the value of things, you learn about people with an inflated idea of themselves. They come in the office every day, flakes we call them, or mincers, asking to look at places they can't afford, salivating over fixtures and fittings that cost more than their entire credit rating, drooling at the prospect of something somewhere in the future that will make them feel like they're in a television ad or a copy of Vogue Decor. It's not realistic. There's a ceiling. Now Veronica was right there, at the ceiling. Touchable if you balanced on tiptoe. She spoke well, but not cut-glass or anything. You definitely can't jump too far in terms of class. You get young and old together, black and white, ugly and handsome, rich and poor. But it's still practically unheard of, in England, for the classes to cross the great divide - at least in my experience. Me and Veronica were definitely pushing the limits, but it was just about on the cards. So. She was attractive, not beautiful. On the turn, a bit of a retread, probably just broken up a long-term relationship and getting very slightly worried about her prospects. I checked her watch: Raymond Weil, mid-range, too new to be inherited. From the flat she was looking at, I could infer that she was well heeled, but not stinking rich. I guessed she was educated from the book she was carrying with her when she came in - something by Virginia Woolf. I could also tell from the fact that it was dog-eared in three places in the first ten pages that she was reading it out of a sense of duty rather than enjoyment, which was fine with me. That meant she was a woman who understood that appearances matter. I did the obvious - asked whether it was for her and her boyfriend (no, they'd just split up), whether she'd be living alone (yes, but no archness in the reply, no flirt). She told me her name was Vronky, which I thought I had misheard, until she explained it was short for Veronica, Veronica Tree. 'We're distantly related to the Beerbohm Trees, don't you know?' she murmured, saying the last three words mock-posh, ultra-posh, as if it was a joke, but underneath I could tell she was proud of it. And although I didn't have the faintest idea who the Bare Bumtrees were, I was impressed. She hummed and hawed her way round the flat. and I could tell she wasn't keen, which established a ground-floor intelligence. But then, Vinnie Jones with a head injury ... I told her what she already knew, that she didn't want this flat, that we get a lot better than this for the same price, that the freeholder was an old villain and that she shouldn't touch it with a bargepole. Again, part of the softening-up process. Get them to trust you. Get them to like you. If they're a woman, get them into bed if possible, but only after you've closed the deal. I'm a closer, me. I always close. \u0095 Extracted from White City Blue by Tim Lott, \u00a9 Tim Lott 1999, published by Penguin Books",

He begins to curse himself, to berate his own ambition for bringing him here to Denmark, for taking him so far from the places and people he had loved. He is at the end of his journey and yet he feels lost. Within this arrival some terrifying departure lies concealed. And suddenly, with peculiar speed, the lamp moves and everything in the room seems to rearrange itself. Peter Claire sees his shadow on the wall become elongated, stretching upwards for a few seconds towards the ceiling before being swallowed by the darkness, with no trace of it remaining.</p> <p>Then the end of a corridor is reached and the gentleman stops before a door.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Universities are close to achieving the big prize: retaining public confidence in the quality of university teaching while removing the huge bureaucratic burden under which we labour. </p> <p>Nothing has recently caused more resentment in the university world than the enormous bureaucracy arising from the proliferation of quality assessments. They are about to reach a climax with both the research assessment exercise in 2001 and the introduction of a new system of assessing teaching quality. </p> <p>I'm not sure the wider world has any idea of the volume of work and preparation involved. Under the current system for teaching quality for example, a single subject appraisal in an individual university often generates around 150 box files of documents and requires several months' preparation. Multiply this 30 or 40 times for a typical university and the call for a \"lighter touch\" by universities is clearly understandable and, indeed, essential. </p> <p>A new streamlined and informative system of assessing academic teaching standards in higher education is recognised by both the Quality Assessment Agency and the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals as essential, and is agreed. Once up and running, we must ensure the new process will provide prospective students and parents with useful, valuable information about teaching quality in particular subjects, and assure us all that public funds are being well spent. </p> <p>In such matters the devil is in the detail. At the heart of the new proposals is a simple pass/fail overall judgment. Essentially, all degree schemes will be given either a green or a red light approved or not approved. </p> <p>But the chief issue under discussion over recent months has been the ostensibly arcane matter of the reporting format. Why is this so important? It is crucial because, by a kind of perverse law, the more finely detailed are the reporting formats, the more burdensome is the bureaucracy. The ever-finer judgments must stand up to possible external judicial review. </p> <p>Universities argued long and hard for a simplified system of reporting outcomes that would instead guide prospective students and their parents toward the narrative comment about particular subjects in particular universities. That would be the really useful substance of any report. This aim has largely been achieved. </p> <p>Each assessment will cover three elements (teaching and learning, student progression, and use of resources) rather than the present six. These reports will be summarised as \"commendable\", \"approved but action recommended\" or \"failing\" (where urgent action is required and a re-visit will follow after a year). </p> <p>Based on knowledge gained from the current system, I don't doubt that the vast majority of provision will fall into the commendable category.

      "bodyText": "Universities are close to achieving the big prize: retaining public confidence in the quality of university teaching while removing the huge bureaucratic burden under which we labour. Nothing has recently caused more resentment in the university world than the enormous bureaucracy arising from the proliferation of quality assessments. They are about to reach a climax with both the research assessment exercise in 2001 and the introduction of a new system of assessing teaching quality. I'm not sure the wider world has any idea of the volume of work and preparation involved. Under the current system for teaching quality for example, a single subject appraisal in an individual university often generates around 150 box files of documents and requires several months' preparation. Multiply this 30 or 40 times for a typical university and the call for a \"lighter touch\" by universities is clearly understandable and, indeed, essential. A new streamlined and informative system of assessing academic teaching standards in higher education is recognised by both the Quality Assessment Agency and the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals as essential, and is agreed. Once up and running, we must ensure the new process will provide prospective students and parents with useful, valuable information about teaching quality in particular subjects, and assure us all that public funds are being well spent. In such matters the devil is in the detail. At the heart of the new proposals is a simple pass/fail overall judgment. Essentially, all degree schemes will be given either a green or a red light approved or not approved. But the chief issue under discussion over recent months has been the ostensibly arcane matter of the reporting format. Why is this so important? It is crucial because, by a kind of perverse law, the more finely detailed are the reporting formats, the more burdensome is the bureaucracy. The ever-finer judgments must stand up to possible external judicial review. Universities argued long and hard for a simplified system of reporting outcomes that would instead guide prospective students and their parents toward the narrative comment about particular subjects in particular universities. That would be the really useful substance of any report. This aim has largely been achieved. Each assessment will cover three elements (teaching and learning, student progression, and use of resources) rather than the present six. These reports will be summarised as \"commendable\", \"approved but action recommended\" or \"failing\" (where urgent action is required and a re-visit will follow after a year). Based on knowledge gained from the current system, I don't doubt that the vast majority of provision will fall into the commendable category. That will lead students to look at the underlying diversity of course offerings rather than relying on a spurious numerical summary. The narrative assessments will also include special reference to any \"exemplary\" aspects where we could learn from each other. This will not constitute a separate category but will be specifically referred to in the report so that the sector as a whole will be able to identify best practice - and learn from it. For example, a particular department might have a superb record for placing students in valuable work experience arenas; another might make brilliant use of computer-aided learning techniques. I am confident this system will be sufficiently simplified to allow us to move on to the so-called \"lighter touch\". Our best brains in universities should be devoted to teaching and research, not endless rounds of paper-chasing and meetings explaining their processes. \u0095 Professor Howard Newby is president of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals.",

This argues strongly for the introduction of languages in primary schools. In the interests of equality of educational provision for all children, it cannot be ignored that languages are taught in the primary phase in virtually every independent school. George Varnava, Chair of Professional Committee, and Professor Ray Page, Chief Executive Officer, The College of Teachers, Theydon Bois, Epping, Essex. Brought to book I read John Davitt's article Recycled Learning with great interest - until I reached the closing remarks on management. The \"special individual\" he's looking for, this \"part network manager, part learning specialist and part information architect,\" already exists. The word he is groping for is \"librarian\". I manage a school Learning Resources Centre. Using the Alice library system, I can catalogue not only the books and other resources in the centre, but also web pages and even word-processed files. A student or teacher can make an inquiry on any computer in the school. The system will show which relevant resources are on loan, which are on the LRC shelves (with a floor plan and flashing spot to show where!), which are web pages - with a single button to go straight into them - and which are Word files, also opened from the catalogue. The key is careful key-wording, and a grasp of the basic cataloguing, classification and indexing principles acquired during library and information-science training. There's no need to reinvent the wheel. Wendy Raybould, LRC Manager, Weston Favell Upper School, Northampton. Feeding the fat cats Eddie McIntyre (New year wishes, Guardian Further, January 11) claims that \"The vast majority of governing bodies value their staff and the excellent work they do, but adequate [salary] increases have not been paid simply because governing bodies cannot afford them.\" This shifting of the blame for low staff salaries onto the government is disingenuous. Many colleges and universities easily unearth the sums necessitated by huge, but undeserved, management pay increases, and this at a time of ruthless cuts in teaching staff, notwithstanding the recent vast increase in student numbers. To give but one example, Leeds Metropolitan University accepted onto its Graphic Design BA last September approximately 30% more students than the previous year's intake, at the same time axing virtually its entire quota of related part-time staff. McIntyre advocates that college employees be allowed to purchase company shares. If he's so keen on sharing out the profits, I suggest that he and his fellow \"fat cat\" managers take a substantial salary cut, distributing the surplus to their underpaid, but no doubt overworked, employees.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If you were a hospital patient awaiting diagnosis, would you rather have exploratory surgery or a scan? With a new framework launched this term, Ofsted has already decided which schools go under the knife with a full inspection and which will be offered the \"keyhole\" techniques of a short inspection. Schools in line for short inspections are over the moon at what promises to be a relatively painless process - the long-awaited \"light touch\".</p> <p>Last term, pilot short inspections were held up and down the country. Dunraven - a Lambeth secondary with a mixed multi-ethnic intake and a high proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals - volunteered as a guinea pig. Standards had been rising continuously and the headteacher, Richard Townsend, was moderately confident. He says: \"The availability of reliable, up-to-date evidence meant we were likely to get a clean bill of health. Getting a short inspection is a tremendous boost to a school like ours.\" </p> <p>With only a draft handbook and some advice from HMI to guide them, the team of four registered inspectors and a lay inspector were breaking new ground. There is a lot less paperwork needed for a short inspection. Teachers need no longer produce plans of work or heads of department conjure up policy documents.</p> <p>The issues for the inspection were thrashed out in a meeting between the head and the lead inspector, Peter McGregor. Like all Ofsted inspectors, McGregor came armed with robust data - the PICSI or pre-inspection context and school indicator. Benchmarking the school's intake, SATs results and other data, like ethnicity and eligibility for free school meals, the PICSI gives the inspectors a general feel for the issues. But a visit is essential to put theories to the test. </p> <p>Establishing a relationship of trust was vital. McGregor explains: \"The meeting helped to shape our perceptions of the school's strengths and weaknesses. When we went in there were no surprises.\" Townsend agrees. \"This is a new relationship with Ofsted. I felt as though we were being treated in a grown-up way.\" </p> <p>Self-evaluation is an important feature of the new inspection system. At Dunraven, the headteacher and senior management routinely monitor and observe lessons carried out in the classroom. Having made in-service training and supporting teachers a priority, Townsend knew that Ofsted's verdict could be unforgiving if any lessons were found to be less than satisfactory. </p> <p>The team was in and out in a matter of three days and the eventual report was an endorsement of the school's progress in raising standards. The most positive point was that 36% of pupils were getting five GCSE grades A-C and 80% were getting grades A-G - almost double the figure of five years ago. McGregor says: \"The only way to improve standards is through teaching, and the only way to improve teaching is through the quality of management and leadership.\" </p> <p>As Ofsted takes the wraps off its new framework for all inspections, schools that have been identified as improving will be offered short inspections, while those where the progress is not so clear cut - even though they might have high standards - will get a full inspection. The two-tier system promises greater consistency and a better use of valuable resources. </p> <p>What can schools expect? </p> <p>Where a team of a dozen inspectors would have taken a week to cover a large secondary school on a full inspection, a short one can be carried out by a team of four individuals in two to three days. As these inspections are much more focused, so the inspectors' judgments have to be precise. The new system reflects Ofsted's confidence in the performance data it has built up since it started inspecting schools in 1996 and reflects a robust quality assurance regime: short inspections are carried out by Ofsted's most experienced and senior inspectors. </p> <p>A short inspection is supposed to take the pressure off staff. Many teachers at Dunraven never saw an inspector and those that did were given a verbal feedback after the lesson. But Ofsted insists short does not mean superficial. Ofsted team member Denise Lynn of Capital Inspections can spot the essentials of good teaching. \"We looked at the pace of a lesson, how it was managed, and the planning that had gone into it. It's fairly obvious when children are involved in the work they are doing.\" </p> <p> On a short inspection, first impressions are important. McGregor says: \"When we were walking down the corridors, if we passed any children the head would introduce us - he knew all their names. During lunch break, pupils would come up to us and ask politely 'What do you think of our school, then?' That says a lot about the headteacher. He's not someone who stays out of sight in his office.\" </p> <p>The head reflects. \"The parents are behind us and the pupils think it's cool to learn. The boys are performing as well as the girls and everyone's aspirations are high.\" </p> <p>What is the reason for Dunraven's rising standards? </p> <p>Townsend says: \"I have gone for a balanced intake, taking equal proportions of pupils from all ability bands. By keeping the school truly comprehensive, all pupils have a chance to perform to the best of their ability and everyone has a stake in the school's success.\" </p> <p>As ever, no system will ever be perfect. The pilot inspections drew negative comments as well as praise. Gillian James, head of Archbishop Temple Church of England school in Preston, missed the detailed feedback on teacher performance. \"It doesn't give you a very searching look at your departments and we got no teaching profiles. For some of our newer department heads this would have been helpful.\" On the positive side, James welcomed the endorsement. \"A short inspection is quite a pat on the back. It's a health check.\" </p> <p>Barbara Hilton, the registered inspector from CEA, the contractor that carried out the Archbishop Temple inspection, believes the short inspections put more emphasis on the role of the lead inspector. \"It's very positive to set the agenda for the inspection within a consultation framework. The focus is 'what can be improved and why? What is positive and why?' But you've got to be flexible; we adjusted our plans to take account of what we saw.\" </p> <p>But equally the announcement of a full inspection will set alarm bells ringing. McGregor says: \"I can see a stigma being attached to a full inspection. It makes parents believe a school is not first rank. It's a clearer message than the league tables. It's the difference between premier league and first division.\" </p> <p>Ofsted's criteria for a short inspection are clear; schools have to be maintaining a high standard or have a trend in attainment which is above the national average. Says McGregor, \"you've got to be improving rapidly.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you were a hospital patient awaiting diagnosis, would you rather have exploratory surgery or a scan? With a new framework launched this term, Ofsted has already decided which schools go under the knife with a full inspection and which will be offered the \"keyhole\" techniques of a short inspection. Schools in line for short inspections are over the moon at what promises to be a relatively painless process - the long-awaited \"light touch\". Last term, pilot short inspections were held up and down the country. Dunraven - a Lambeth secondary with a mixed multi-ethnic intake and a high proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals - volunteered as a guinea pig. Standards had been rising continuously and the headteacher, Richard Townsend, was moderately confident. He says: \"The availability of reliable, up-to-date evidence meant we were likely to get a clean bill of health. Getting a short inspection is a tremendous boost to a school like ours.\" With only a draft handbook and some advice from HMI to guide them, the team of four registered inspectors and a lay inspector were breaking new ground. There is a lot less paperwork needed for a short inspection. Teachers need no longer produce plans of work or heads of department conjure up policy documents. The issues for the inspection were thrashed out in a meeting between the head and the lead inspector, Peter McGregor. Like all Ofsted inspectors, McGregor came armed with robust data - the PICSI or pre-inspection context and school indicator. Benchmarking the school's intake, SATs results and other data, like ethnicity and eligibility for free school meals, the PICSI gives the inspectors a general feel for the issues. But a visit is essential to put theories to the test. Establishing a relationship of trust was vital. McGregor explains: \"The meeting helped to shape our perceptions of the school's strengths and weaknesses. When we went in there were no surprises.\" Townsend agrees. \"This is a new relationship with Ofsted. I felt as though we were being treated in a grown-up way.\" Self-evaluation is an important feature of the new inspection system. At Dunraven, the headteacher and senior management routinely monitor and observe lessons carried out in the classroom. Having made in-service training and supporting teachers a priority, Townsend knew that Ofsted's verdict could be unforgiving if any lessons were found to be less than satisfactory. The team was in and out in a matter of three days and the eventual report was an endorsement of the school's progress in raising standards. The most positive point was that 36% of pupils were getting five GCSE grades A-C and 80% were getting grades A-G - almost double the figure of five years ago. McGregor says: \"The only way to improve standards is through teaching, and the only way to improve teaching is through the quality of management and leadership.\" As Ofsted takes the wraps off its new framework for all inspections, schools that have been identified as improving will be offered short inspections, while those where the progress is not so clear cut - even though they might have high standards - will get a full inspection. The two-tier system promises greater consistency and a better use of valuable resources. What can schools expect? Where a team of a dozen inspectors would have taken a week to cover a large secondary school on a full inspection, a short one can be carried out by a team of four individuals in two to three days. As these inspections are much more focused, so the inspectors' judgments have to be precise. The new system reflects Ofsted's confidence in the performance data it has built up since it started inspecting schools in 1996 and reflects a robust quality assurance regime: short inspections are carried out by Ofsted's most experienced and senior inspectors. A short inspection is supposed to take the pressure off staff. Many teachers at Dunraven never saw an inspector and those that did were given a verbal feedback after the lesson. But Ofsted insists short does not mean superficial. Ofsted team member Denise Lynn of Capital Inspections can spot the essentials of good teaching. \"We looked at the pace of a lesson, how it was managed, and the planning that had gone into it. It's fairly obvious when children are involved in the work they are doing.\" On a short inspection, first impressions are important. McGregor says: \"When we were walking down the corridors, if we passed any children the head would introduce us - he knew all their names. During lunch break, pupils would come up to us and ask politely 'What do you think of our school, then?' That says a lot about the headteacher. He's not someone who stays out of sight in his office.\" The head reflects. \"The parents are behind us and the pupils think it's cool to learn. The boys are performing as well as the girls and everyone's aspirations are high.\" What is the reason for Dunraven's rising standards? Townsend says: \"I have gone for a balanced intake, taking equal proportions of pupils from all ability bands. By keeping the school truly comprehensive, all pupils have a chance to perform to the best of their ability and everyone has a stake in the school's success.\" As ever, no system will ever be perfect. The pilot inspections drew negative comments as well as praise. Gillian James, head of Archbishop Temple Church of England school in Preston, missed the detailed feedback on teacher performance. \"It doesn't give you a very searching look at your departments and we got no teaching profiles. For some of our newer department heads this would have been helpful.\" On the positive side, James welcomed the endorsement. \"A short inspection is quite a pat on the back. It's a health check.\" Barbara Hilton, the registered inspector from CEA, the contractor that carried out the Archbishop Temple inspection, believes the short inspections put more emphasis on the role of the lead inspector. \"It's very positive to set the agenda for the inspection within a consultation framework. The focus is 'what can be improved and why? What is positive and why?' But you've got to be flexible; we adjusted our plans to take account of what we saw.\" But equally the announcement of a full inspection will set alarm bells ringing. McGregor says: \"I can see a stigma being attached to a full inspection. It makes parents believe a school is not first rank. It's a clearer message than the league tables. It's the difference between premier league and first division.\" Ofsted's criteria for a short inspection are clear; schools have to be maintaining a high standard or have a trend in attainment which is above the national average. Says McGregor, \"you've got to be improving rapidly.\"",

He sees them as an important check to ensure that college principals are properly supervised, and cannot run amok with public money, or bully staff and students, in the way that some have done in recent years. He's clearly relying on their sharp eyes and ears, and lack of cynicism, to help keep the sector clean. </p> <p>\"There is a difference\" he tells them \"between public and private money and how it can be spent.\" There are very few things that should be kept secret from them, he says, and they should question any secrecy closely.

      "body": "<p>Like every other teacher, I too, picked my jaw up off the floor on reading the news this month that I was to get a 50% government subsidy on a brand new computer system. My first thought was to grab an application form and order a machine within the week, in case (like the Blunkett laptops-for-teachers scheme) the benefactors removed this golden carrot. However, it pays to heed advice before entering a crowded marketplace. </p> <p>If you haven't considered buying a PC or laptop for home use before, perhaps now is the time. You may never get an \"offer you can't refuse\" like this again. As an information communication and technology coordinator (ICT), I have been inundated with requests for advice and help by fellow teachers in choosing the \"right\" machine from the list of 19 accredited suppliers. So first ask your ICT coordinator or computing inspector. Ask a friend in industry who may be using the systems from one of the accredited suppliers. </p> <p>After short-listing companies with a good track record for quality products, contact each one for literature on their particular deal. You will be surprised how much they differ, even though all comply with the specifications laid down in the application booklet. </p> <p>So what will you need? </p> <p>\u0095 Try to get the fastest processor you can, 500mhz if possible. </p> <p>\u0095 128Mb of RAM (memory) will provide you with plenty of room as your needs grow. But if this pushes the price up too much, ensure that your chosen machine can be upgraded from 64Mb later. </p> <p>\u0095 A large hard disc drive is also essential. Treat the specified 6 Gb as a minimum. The bigger the better. </p> <p>\u0095 Monitors deteriorate from the time you first switch them on. A flat screen monitor does not and is better all round (no radiation, low power, clear and bright). If you can negotiate one of these in the deal, all well and good. Remember, too, that a 15-inch flat screen is equal in viewing area to a 17-inch CRT (standard) monitor. If the flat screen has a video input as well - you will have a stunning video display. </p> <p>\u0095 Don't buy a computer with on-board video memory or on-board sound or a so-called \"soft\" modem. A 4mb graphics card with 3D capability, a high specification sound card (like a SoundBlaster) and a 56K integral modem are all desirable. </p> <p>\u0095 A DVD drive may be a better bet in the long term than a fast CD-Rom.

      "bodyText": "Like every other teacher, I too, picked my jaw up off the floor on reading the news this month that I was to get a 50% government subsidy on a brand new computer system. My first thought was to grab an application form and order a machine within the week, in case (like the Blunkett laptops-for-teachers scheme) the benefactors removed this golden carrot. However, it pays to heed advice before entering a crowded marketplace. If you haven't considered buying a PC or laptop for home use before, perhaps now is the time. You may never get an \"offer you can't refuse\" like this again. As an information communication and technology coordinator (ICT), I have been inundated with requests for advice and help by fellow teachers in choosing the \"right\" machine from the list of 19 accredited suppliers. So first ask your ICT coordinator or computing inspector. Ask a friend in industry who may be using the systems from one of the accredited suppliers. After short-listing companies with a good track record for quality products, contact each one for literature on their particular deal. You will be surprised how much they differ, even though all comply with the specifications laid down in the application booklet. So what will you need? \u0095 Try to get the fastest processor you can, 500mhz if possible. \u0095 128Mb of RAM (memory) will provide you with plenty of room as your needs grow. But if this pushes the price up too much, ensure that your chosen machine can be upgraded from 64Mb later. \u0095 A large hard disc drive is also essential. Treat the specified 6 Gb as a minimum. The bigger the better. \u0095 Monitors deteriorate from the time you first switch them on. A flat screen monitor does not and is better all round (no radiation, low power, clear and bright). If you can negotiate one of these in the deal, all well and good. Remember, too, that a 15-inch flat screen is equal in viewing area to a 17-inch CRT (standard) monitor. If the flat screen has a video input as well - you will have a stunning video display. \u0095 Don't buy a computer with on-board video memory or on-board sound or a so-called \"soft\" modem. A 4mb graphics card with 3D capability, a high specification sound card (like a SoundBlaster) and a 56K integral modem are all desirable. \u0095 A DVD drive may be a better bet in the long term than a fast CD-Rom. But do ensure the DVD (6-speed or greater) will play all the latest CD-Roms without hiccupping. Similarly, if it has MPEG capabilities you will be able to use and store digital video for multimedia presentations. Software MPEG is not good enough. \u0095 The keyboard and mouse are personal preferences. If possible, check the keyboard - some are very \"spongy\" while others are overly \"clacky\"! A mouse with a central roller is helpful when scrolling in windows and web pages. \u0095 External speakers can be placed in strategic positions to improve sound reproduction if you have the room. Mains-powered speakers are a must. If you have a good idea about the specification of system you need, don't be limited by the specification laid down in the booklet. Thanks to the generosity of the scheme, I can specify a very capable machine with a lot more beef than I could afford previously. Negotiate with the suppliers to get the system you want.

      "body": "<p>Things we know. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. We're born, we grow up, we grow old, we die. Now try telling this to one of the 1,000 children under 15 diagnosed with cancer each year in the UK.</p> <p>Few of us cope well with death. We see young people starving in Africa, we see children dying in war zones and we feel gutted. But we also feel distanced. We mediate our feelings through television and we rationalise how it couldn't happen here, especially not to those we love.</p> <p>Yet bad things do happen here. Children do get life-threatening illnesses and so, more frequently, do their parents. Much as we may want to preserve an idealised version of a natural order, we can't. There is no guaranteed immunity on offer. So, many children have to face the big questions of mortality much sooner than anyone would want. Which leaves parents and teachers to work out how best to handle them. </p> <p>Jennie Fishwick, 13, lives in Whickham, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Just over two years ago she was diagnosed with a tumour in her shoulder blade. This was her second experience of cancer. When she was three, she had a tumour on her kidney, but doctors are still not sure whether the second tumour is linked to the first. She had an operation to remove her shoulder blade, followed by six months of chemotherapy. Her treatment ended in July 1998, and she has been free of cancer since. </p> <p>\"Many of my friends cried when I told them I had cancer again,\" says Jennie. \"They were all very supportive and treated me as if I was normal. But I didn't feel normal. I still feel different today. I get out of breath easily, my stamina's not back, I pick up infections easily and I don't have full use of my arm. My friends think it's great I can't do PE, but I miss it and there are some clothes I can't wear any more. Sometimes I get so frustrated when I see nasty people on the TV that I shout, 'It should have been you, not me'.\" </p> <p>Midway through her treatment, Jennie moved from her primary school in Whickham to a secondary school in Blaydon. The teachers maintained consistent levels of support, giving her extra help and attention when needed, but some of her new school mates teased and bullied her. \"I used to wear a hat to hide the fact that my hair was growing back after chemo,\" she continues. \"One of the boys pulled it off and several others started saying I was a boy, not a girl.\" </p> <p>Jennie's illness has had a knock-on effect throughout the family. Her parents say their lives have been shattered and her 11-year-old sister, Nicola, has had to grow up fast. \"I was devastated,\" she says. \"I didn't know she wouldn't die, I just hoped she wouldn't. I spent some nights in the hospital but I often felt happiest at school. I knew my parents didn't have as much time for me, but I knew Jennie needed the attention.\" </p> <p>Sarah Hoburn, 15, has found things a little easier. A year ago she was diagnosed with colon cancer. She has since had an operation and chemotherapy and is now back at school. \"My hair didn't even fall out during chemo and my energy levels are now back to normal,\" she says breezily. \"Even when I was told I had cancer, my first thought was I was going to get better.\" </p> <p>Such positivity is by no means the norm. Many children have no real concept of what cancer is. If they've heard of it at all, they generally assume it's fatal but have no idea of how it develops and whether it's contagious. Typically, it also inspires fear and uncertainty, both in the patient and in friends and family, and the combination can cause havoc in the classroom. </p> <p>It is with this in mind that Macmillan Cancer Relief has produced new educational teaching resources to be used in primary and secondary schools. Macmillan is ideally placed to do this, as it is often the Macmillan counsellor who liaises with children, parents and teachers on the best way of breaking the news to classmates. </p> <p>\"I try to keep things as normal as possible,\" says Patricia Williams, a Macmillan counsellor. \"Children facing survival issues - either their own, a parent's or a friend's - often feel anxious, clingy or depressed. In some cases their behaviour may also be affected. However, there is no point in overloading children with information as that can make them feel worse. It is often best to start by finding out what they know and what they don't and what they are curious to know. This allows you to work at their pace. If children can't articulate their feelings in words, they can often do so through drawing. However, you can't generalise as each situation is different.\" </p> <p>Macmillan's watchword is inclusion, and a measure of the impact they have made can be judged by the experience of Miles Meacock, who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's disease while at Seaford College 10 years ago. \"I only discovered I had cancer while I was on my third session of chemo,\" he says. \"I was probably rather naive, but neither the doctor, the surgeon nor my parents told me and I didn't have a clue. I just thought I had some kind of nasty bump. I was terribly angry when I discovered, as I felt I had been lied to. When I eventually got back to school, everyone was kind, but they made it clear that they didn't want to talk about it, either. It made me feel I had a disease to be ashamed of, and it was years before I could talk about it properly.\" </p> <p>Becky Mepsted, a primary teacher at Honeywell School in south-west London, who has a boy in her year 3 class away from school with leukaemia, tries to pre-empt such problems wherever possible. \"It is the child's illness, so you have to work with the child and the parents,\" she says, \"but I always try to build on what they know and prepare them for the future. Sometimes we can do this better than parents, especially those who are not confident. Above all, I believe in honesty. When children ask me about the scar on my neck, I tell them I had an operation for a tumour. I say, 'I'm a 28-year-old healthy woman who has had cancer and you don't always die'.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Yellow Yale Shame on Yale College, Wrexham for caving in to those big bullies at Bill Clinton's alma mater. The contention by Yale, the American Ivy League university, that the Welsh college could be passing itself off as a satellite outstation is complete horsey do-dos. To quote a judge's ruling in a famous passing off case, \"a blind moron in a hurry\" wouldn't mistake this fine Welsh institution for that Mickey Mouse outfit over the pond. Chairwoman Congrats to Ethel Truin, 82, who has notched up 40 years as a keep-fit lecturer at West Suffolk College. These days her Increase Your Mobility class for the 80- and 90-plus is mostly done from a chair. Piping hot Welcome, first Scottish School of Asian Cuisine, which was launched yesterday amid massive splendour in Edinburgh. Growing skill shortages in Asian catering, the fastest growing food sector north of the Tweed, prompted Fife College, Kirkcaldy and the Scottish Asian Restaurants Association to set up this venture. And yes, there was a piper, and a haggis pakora, to mark the eve of Burn's night.",

      "body": "<p>A few months after moving to the Cambridgeshire village of Histon, accountant Ian Strachan went to a meeting at his children's junior school. He arrived as one of a handful of parents who wanted to find out more about being a governor. By the time he left that evening, he was chair of the finance committee. </p> <p>In the 20 years since parents officially gained the right to sit on school governing bodies, they have become indispensable to schools. As the paperwork and responsibilities have increased, many of the retired aldermen and political young bloods have dropped out. Their replacements, not only as elected parent governors but also as co-opted experts or nominated by local authorities and churches, are more and more likely to be parents. They, after all, have a vested interest in getting the work done. </p> <p>So why do parents become school governors? What do they expect to achieve over one or two four-year terms of office? Do their expectations stay the same? Is it ever possible to fulfil them? Many parents become governors because, like Ian Strachan, they get asked to take on the job. They say yes partly because they feel unable to say no, and partly because they want to help. </p> <p>Few parent governors stand for election on a manifesto of radical change, according to consultant and writer Joan Sallis, who trains governors all over the country. \"They want to play a part in their own school, and they feel they have something to offer,\" she says. </p> <p>They also want to get to know the school from the inside - an opportunity that appeals particularly to parents of older children, according to Margaret Charlesworth, a social survey interviewer now in her eighth year as parent governor at Thurston Community College, a 14-18 upper school in Suffolk: \"You see what's going on and you meet the staff. You do have to restrain yourself in meetings from saying 'Ah, but my daughter's teacher does so and so'. But you don't get an insight into an upper school otherwise, because your children don't want you around\". </p> <p>The self-restraint habit is one that many parent governors feel obliged to adopt. Gordon Gillespie, a college lecturer and new governor at Thurston, stood for election because he wanted to be a voice for low achievers in a highly successful academic school. The amount of work needed to make his voice heard came as a shock, he says: </p> <p>\"They have these enormous agendas to get through, with perhaps 17 items, and the governors' meeting will last for two or three hours. The presentations from the school are very professional, but it tends to be more telling us what they intend to do than a decision-making process. I expect it to take a year before I have any effect, and I am a fairly outspoken person.\" </p> <p>In fact, the bulk of governors' work does not take place in the once or twice-termly governing body meetings anyway, but in sub-committees. Most schools now have these at least for finance, curriculum, personnel and premises. Then there will be ad hoc committees for recruiting staff or hearing disciplinary appeals or appeals from families refused entry to the school. Most schools also organise regular governors' visits to classrooms, usually focusing on a particular subject or aspect of work, for governors now have a formal responsibility to monitor standards. During an Ofsted visit, the inspectors will grill them as well. </p> <p>Exercising that responsibility can be difficult, says Lisa Challens, who recently finished her four-year term as a governor at Rushmore Junior School in Hackney. The then-chair of governors asked her if she would be co-opted onto Rushmore governors, at a time when the school was struggling - the government has since recognised it as one of the fastest-improving schools in the country - because she is a qualified accountant, but also because she has a disabled son. </p> <p>\"It was wanting to help parents with children with special needs that persuaded me to do it,\" she says. \"I felt that people complain all the time about schools, so why not get in there and do something?\" As part of the job, she went into school twice a week to talk to the bursar and the special needs co-ordinator. She also observed teachers and reading recovery assistants at work. </p> <p>It was a sobering experience: \"I knew those teachers could have felt terribly threatened by me, and I needed them to feel supported. I was also aware that I couldn't go in and niggle about things. When I reported back to the head, I tended to criticise by omission, to leave out someone I didn't feel I could praise. </p> <p>\"I felt I could influence things by my views and my personality, but I would have had to be very, very persistent where there was a need to bring about big changes. Whereas when a new head came in, she said 'we must deal with this' and did, almost straightaway.\" </p> <p>Headteachers can be wary of parent governors, says Joan Sallis, particularly those who bring up other parents' complaints under Any Other Business: \"Heads say that parents' views are too short-term, that parents find it difficult to take a strategic view. Sometimes that's because they don't know what to do with comments that are thrown at them in the supermarket. Sometimes it's because they are too interested in their own child's group or class. </p> <p>\"I usually say that parents may be like that in their first year, but give them responsibility for a working party on special needs, for example, and they become tremendously aware of the mix of advantages and disadvantages in a school.\" </p> <p>She sees that change as a growth in understanding. Others might see it as a taming of parent governors, a gradual erosion of their outsiders' viewpoint and consumer role. Parents who do come in as consumer champions can find they have a battle on their hands: Ellen Jones (not her real name) became a governor at her daughter's primary school, where two staff were on long-term sick leave and there was a critical Ofsted looming, because she felt \"they needed more governors who were in touch with people in the playground\". </p> <p>At her first meeting, the scale of the task became clear: \"I suppose it confirmed all my worst fears. The headteacher did all the work and the governors just turned up to meetings. I found myself pushing, saying 'you need to do this, you need to do that, you need a plan, you're not meeting your responsibilities', and it was very difficult indeed to achieve change.\" </p> <p>It was a frustrating and miserable experience; after two years she resigned. But even in the most open schools, the representative role of parent governors is difficult. Like MPs, once elected they are expected to bring forward all their constituents' points of view, but vote according to their own conscience. Some parent governors are told firmly by the head that they must not solicit parental opinions, says Joan Sallis. Others are encouraged to set up suggestion boxes or run surgeries. </p> <p> These can be more trouble than they are worth: \"The biggest debate we had was about whether there should be a uniform or not,\" recalls Lisa Challens. \"I didn't care and the head didn't care, but I ended up with a collection of vehement letters on both sides.\" </p> <p>Rushmore's new chair of governors, parent and health service worker Yvonne Servante, wants to find new mechanisms to open up the system, to draw parents into the work of governors without actually taking on the whole job: \"Governors need such a broad range of expertise. One minute you might be talking about education policy, the next about catering contracts. I want us to link into wider networks: for example, we have had parents who were complaining about lunchtimes on a lunchtime working party and we have found a parent to advise us on underachieving African-Caribbean boys.\" </p> <p>Yet she, too, sees inevitable barriers between the parent who is not a governor and the parent who is. Once governors have taken a decision, all of them must stand by it - even if they opposed it all the way. Sometimes, because of employee, pupil or commercial confidentiality, they cannot even give the reasons why it was made. </p> <p>So it is true that the parent governor knows more than the ordinary parent. But ironically, knowing more can mean acting less. \"Because I'm a parent governor I try to make an extra effort to be undemanding and supportive of my child's teachers,\" says Yvonne Servante. \"I do balance what I think about what my child gets by what I know about the school overall\". </p> <p>The point was frequently repeated. Parent governors, far from feeling empowered or active in their child's education, actually feel inhibited from intervening on their behalf. \"There were times when I wanted to go into school as a parent,\" says Margaret Charlesworth, \"and I didn't.\" That does not mean governors feel powerless. All those interviewed felt they made a difference through their opportunities to question, monitor, steer, dissuade and inspire. </p> <p>But it is gradual, strategic work away from the classroom, and the inhibitors, as Ian Strachan soon discovered, are strong. \"You have significant responsibility, but your power is very constrained. You can't build an extension or recruit another teacher to get class sizes down because you can't afford it. You don't have powers over what is taught because it's dictated by the national curriculum and SATs. You want to be strategic and look ahead, but often all you have is an annual 'where can we cut costs?' It's difficult to make a difference. You carry on because the only alternative is to give up, and that would be more detrimental to the children.\"</p> <p><strong>On the PTA, you can do cakes or the accounts</strong></p> <p>It sounds unglamorous, and often - while you sweep up the polystyrene dots that some post-modernist packed into the lucky dip - it is. But supporting your school's Parent Teacher Association can have more impact on your child's education than you might think. </p> <p>If you help a teacher in the classroom, you might exchange a few words at the start of the lesson. But if, after school, you discuss how you can help her book week, or you dry dishes together during a dance, you not only get to know each other but you become colleagues and equals. </p> <p>If you become a school governor, you are hemmed in by governments, inspectors, committee timetables, the state of the toilets. But on the PTA you can set your own goals. You can build a new library. You can run a community arts weekend. You can go ahead and paint the toilets. </p> <p>Good PTAs build strong communities. They produce newsletters and directories of family phone numbers. They run autumn teas to draw in newcomers. They underpin alliances between the head and parents, between teachers and parents, between parents and other parents. When they work well, these relationships are hardly noticed. Without them, schools can fall apart. Everyone plays to their strengths on a PTA. You have an MBA and 20 years' marketing experience? Write those begging letters now. </p> <p>On top of all this, the money that you raise will buy books and equipment that your child needs now, not when the school budget can afford them. Of course the PTA risks being the headteacher's patsy: just staying silent and signing the cheques. But most heads want to confide in parents who they see as supportive: they will swap ideas which, in the general run of assemblies or parents' meetings, they normally have no time to discuss. </p> <p>So when survey after survey shows teacher morale at rock bottom, is there any harm in a bit of unequivocal support? You don't swear never to criticise when you sign up for an hour on the tombola. What you do is to say: \"I want to help. I am doing this for you and for my child. I am also doing it because even two hours on the tombola is easier than facing 33 nine-year-olds on a Friday afternoon.\"</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was heralded by ministers as the greatest public-private partnership of its kind. In July 1998, the government and the Wellcome Trust unveiled a joint \u00a3600m fund for scientific facilities in universities. After years of underfunding, university laboratories were finally set for a life-saving boost. Almost as an afterthought, the world's largest medical charity announced it was committing \u00a3110m to a joint government project to build an X-ray synchrotron machine.</p> <p>The unprecedented partnership was a biomedical scientist's dream: a charity prepared to channel hundreds of millions of pounds into biomedical research; and a government persuaded that scientific discoveries will underpin tomorrow's successful high-flying businesses. </p> <p>Who would think, then, that after 18 months the marriage would be on the rocks? Last week, trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers told MPs the question where to site the new synchrotron, called Diamond, was still unresolved. </p> <p>New studies to determine if the Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire or the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory outside Oxford should house Diamond had remained inconclusive. Byers stressed that with up to \u00a3300m committed to the project, he would \"be conscious of wider government objectives in relation to employment in the regions and economic regeneration\" when making the long delayed final decision this week. </p> <p>It was these wider social and political factors which last year persuaded Byers that Diamond should be housed in the north-west rather than Oxford. But the House of Commons' science and technology committee also heard last month from Dr Mike Dexter, director of the Wellcome Trust, that unless the latest reviews provided substantial scientific evidence against Oxford, the charity's favoured site, the trust would be forced to withdraw from the partnership altogether. Last week Byers conceded that without Wellcome, the government could not fund existing synchrotron plans. </p> <p>The row over Diamond has raised uncomfortable questions over the government's commitment to science, and public-private partnerships in general. Some fear it might jeopardise the future support of scientists, and the UK's economic future as a whole. A north-south rift has emerged among academic leaders, with vice-chancellors from universities in the north-west, such as Manchester and Liverpool, lobbying government officials behind the scenes, complaining about the concentration of research funds in general in the south-east. </p> <p>According to a submission to MPs from Wellcome, as early as April 1999 civil servants from the Office of Science and Technology were convinced that joint siting with another major research facility, and the cluster of scientific expertise in the Oxford region, made the Rutherford Lab the best location for the synchrotron. By June 1999, the siting of Diamond at Rutherford had become a government \"non-negotiable\" in the project talks. And by September 1999 the project's newly acquired French government partners backed the Oxford plans. </p> <p>Then in early October Wellcome received a bombshell: Byers wrote to say he \"was minded\" to site Diamond at Daresbury. Correspondence between Byers and Dexter since has become increasingly strained, with Dexter insisting on Rutherford and Byers sticking with Daresbury. </p> <p>On at least two counts Byers last week directly contradicted the trust's evidence. He claimed no earlier government decision had been made and this was a \"misunderstanding\" by the trust. The minister also said French officials had not \"expressed openly any preference for one side or the other\". Civil servants have privately said they had no inkling of the controversy to arise over Diamond. But past lab closures have shown powerful forces can be unleashed from a group of close-knit scientists, whose future is suddenly threatened. </p> <p>Every scientific plus point for Oxford has been rebutted by the Daresbury trade union campaign. The mire of claims and counter-claims is more usually encountered during in-depth legal disputes. Diamond decisions being carried out almost exclusively behind Whitehall's closed doors have not helped. </p> <p>Dexter, who comes from the north-west, has stressed that Wellcome's preference for Oxford has been based strictly on its scientific mission to improve human health. In truth, the split is about two different visions from two men in very different circumstances. Dexter envisages Diamond as another step in the development of the south-east as a world centre for biomedical research, which will in years to come yield new powerful medicines and benefits for the country as a whole. Byers sees a need to safeguard the scientific community, as well as jobs and businesses, (and some cynics would say Labour seats) in the north-west. </p> <p>Byers said last week that other joint Wellcome schemes would be unaffected by the Diamond debate. Yet the trust is known to be more reluctant to commit further money to the fund for university scientific facilities. At the very least, Wellcome is likely to demand decision-making procedures are clarified before it signs up for future collaborations. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Byers reassured MPs that the lab that loses out will receive other science funds. One senior government offical recently met heads of the north-west universities to discuss a new computing centre for the region. A signal that Rutherford will get the go-ahead?

      "bodyText": "It was heralded by ministers as the greatest public-private partnership of its kind. In July 1998, the government and the Wellcome Trust unveiled a joint \u00a3600m fund for scientific facilities in universities. After years of underfunding, university laboratories were finally set for a life-saving boost. Almost as an afterthought, the world's largest medical charity announced it was committing \u00a3110m to a joint government project to build an X-ray synchrotron machine. The unprecedented partnership was a biomedical scientist's dream: a charity prepared to channel hundreds of millions of pounds into biomedical research; and a government persuaded that scientific discoveries will underpin tomorrow's successful high-flying businesses. Who would think, then, that after 18 months the marriage would be on the rocks? Last week, trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers told MPs the question where to site the new synchrotron, called Diamond, was still unresolved. New studies to determine if the Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire or the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory outside Oxford should house Diamond had remained inconclusive. Byers stressed that with up to \u00a3300m committed to the project, he would \"be conscious of wider government objectives in relation to employment in the regions and economic regeneration\" when making the long delayed final decision this week. It was these wider social and political factors which last year persuaded Byers that Diamond should be housed in the north-west rather than Oxford. But the House of Commons' science and technology committee also heard last month from Dr Mike Dexter, director of the Wellcome Trust, that unless the latest reviews provided substantial scientific evidence against Oxford, the charity's favoured site, the trust would be forced to withdraw from the partnership altogether. Last week Byers conceded that without Wellcome, the government could not fund existing synchrotron plans. The row over Diamond has raised uncomfortable questions over the government's commitment to science, and public-private partnerships in general. Some fear it might jeopardise the future support of scientists, and the UK's economic future as a whole. A north-south rift has emerged among academic leaders, with vice-chancellors from universities in the north-west, such as Manchester and Liverpool, lobbying government officials behind the scenes, complaining about the concentration of research funds in general in the south-east. According to a submission to MPs from Wellcome, as early as April 1999 civil servants from the Office of Science and Technology were convinced that joint siting with another major research facility, and the cluster of scientific expertise in the Oxford region, made the Rutherford Lab the best location for the synchrotron. By June 1999, the siting of Diamond at Rutherford had become a government \"non-negotiable\" in the project talks. And by September 1999 the project's newly acquired French government partners backed the Oxford plans. Then in early October Wellcome received a bombshell: Byers wrote to say he \"was minded\" to site Diamond at Daresbury. Correspondence between Byers and Dexter since has become increasingly strained, with Dexter insisting on Rutherford and Byers sticking with Daresbury. On at least two counts Byers last week directly contradicted the trust's evidence. He claimed no earlier government decision had been made and this was a \"misunderstanding\" by the trust. The minister also said French officials had not \"expressed openly any preference for one side or the other\". Civil servants have privately said they had no inkling of the controversy to arise over Diamond. But past lab closures have shown powerful forces can be unleashed from a group of close-knit scientists, whose future is suddenly threatened. Every scientific plus point for Oxford has been rebutted by the Daresbury trade union campaign. The mire of claims and counter-claims is more usually encountered during in-depth legal disputes. Diamond decisions being carried out almost exclusively behind Whitehall's closed doors have not helped. Dexter, who comes from the north-west, has stressed that Wellcome's preference for Oxford has been based strictly on its scientific mission to improve human health. In truth, the split is about two different visions from two men in very different circumstances. Dexter envisages Diamond as another step in the development of the south-east as a world centre for biomedical research, which will in years to come yield new powerful medicines and benefits for the country as a whole. Byers sees a need to safeguard the scientific community, as well as jobs and businesses, (and some cynics would say Labour seats) in the north-west. Byers said last week that other joint Wellcome schemes would be unaffected by the Diamond debate. Yet the trust is known to be more reluctant to commit further money to the fund for university scientific facilities. At the very least, Wellcome is likely to demand decision-making procedures are clarified before it signs up for future collaborations. Meanwhile, Byers reassured MPs that the lab that loses out will receive other science funds. One senior government offical recently met heads of the north-west universities to discuss a new computing centre for the region. A signal that Rutherford will get the go-ahead? The university community waits with baited breath. Why Welcome is pivotal to UK research The government would probably not be able to take part in any debates about the future of UK biomedical science, if it was not for the Wellcome Trust. Without the billions of pounds channelled into UK universities and research institutes by the world's richest charity, the country would not be competing with the likes of the US to push back the frontiers of genetic science and develop the new drugs and medical treatments of the future. Government funding for research in the UK has fallen well behind levels in other Western nations. The Wellcome Trust was created in 1936 from share capital assets of the Wellcome drug company as an independent funder of non-commercial research following the final wish of the US philanthropist company, Sir Henry Wellcome. But it was not until the late 1990s, after the Trust sold most of its Wellcome shares and the Glaxo and Wellcome drug companies had merged, that the charity was catapulted into the big money league. With assets of some \u00a313bn, Wellcome has spent \u00a3600m during the latest financial year. The recent merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham could be further good news for biomedical researchers: the trust owns 4.7% of GW shares, although this is the only link between the two organisations. Its meteoric rise to power has meant that relations between Wellcome and the government have always been strained. Early disagreements concerned the trust's support of research project grants in universities, which did not include overheads for general support facilities. It has also used its position to pressurise the government into improving researchers' pay; eg increasing its own PhD grants and postdoctoral salaries. Unlike the government, the trust can wipe the slate clean annually and decide where next to allocate its funds. One area it does not support, though, is cancer research.

      "bodyText": "Suspected killers cleared by the courts should be forced to stand trial again where DNA genetic fingerprinting unearths \"compelling\" new evidence, the director of public prosecutions recommended today. David Calvert-Smith QC said the law on double jeopardy - where no defendant can be tried twice for the same crime - should be relaxed in exceptional cases for serious crimes like murder. In evidence to the Commons home affairs select committee, Mr Calvert-Smith backed the law commission's proposal in the report into the death of Stephen Lawrence to change the current law. The head of the prosecution service in England and Wales told the committee: \"Firstly, victims deserve better treatment than they are getting. \"Secondly, it is a scandal that people can go about boasting about crimes they have committed without fear of redress.\" He suggested the rule change be retrospective, allowing fresh trials for crimes dating back dozens of years, even though he predicted it would only affect a \"handful\" of cases. He said one key reason for a relaxation was the \"dramatic\" advance in forensic science, including the development of genetic fingerprinting, which is increasingly used to devastating effect in trials. Other important innovations included \"corneal mapping\" - where photographs can record and identify the unique pattern of people's eyes - and the enhancement of closed circuit TV images. Fresh proceedings could also be sparked by religious conversion, when a religious convert confessed to past sins or when previously untraceable witnesses had been located, said Mr Calvert-Smith. He told the committee: \"I would hope that a number of defendants would realise that with new DNA evidence the game is up and plead guilty at a new trial.\" But the QC warned that the state should not be allowed to bring unlimited fresh proceedings, or to renew old cases to make up for police incompetence. A line had to be drawn somewhere in the prosecution's ability to bring fresh proceedings - or the law would become \"oppressive\". In a blow to victims of bungled police inquiries, Mr Calvert-Smith went on: \"No judge would ever allow the prosecution to have a second bite at the cherry to make up for police incompetence at the first trial. \"No prosecutor under my control would ever consider that that was an appropriate way of carrying on.\" Kent's chief constable David Phillips - also appearing before the committee - estimated that several cases where defendants had been acquitted could be revisited with a change in the law. He told the MPs: \"There are one or two cases involving child homicide where there is DNA evidence where someone has been acquitted.\" Backing the proposed change, Mr Phillips - chairman of the crime committee of the association of chief police officers - added: \"I am always suspicious of lofty principles that we are encouraged to believe should stand alone.

Yesterday he chose to concentrate on the management track record rather than on his deal- making skills that had some investors hoping for a takeover bid by retail entrepreneur Phillip Green or supermarket group Tesco. Mr Vandevelde said that he was not intimidated by the task of trying to woo big shareholders back into the M&amp;S fan club, claiming acquaintance with many as they had held shares in Promod\u00e8s.",

Which just about covers the money they have spent on Stanley.</p> <p>Stanley was unavailable for comment today (presumably he was in his room putting together a sitcom about a talented man locked in his room) but The Deadliest Doug Of Them All wasn't. \"It means very simply that \u00a326m is being invested - \u00a311m of it in three weeks' time - subject to our shareholders agreeing,\" said the Villa chairman of the deal, \"and I'm sure they will.\"</p> <p>After putting his silent movie villain top hat and twirly moustache kit away, Deadly explained the nature of Villa's relationship with those lovely wire people. NTL, through Premium TV, will have exclusive rights to run any Villa TV channel that might spring up in the future. And any broadcast website. As well as acting as the club's agent in any sponsorship or advertising deals. But, as Deadly pointed out, \"they will not have a director on the board and the existing board will decide the policy of the club, rest assured.\"</p> <p>Suitably reassured, Deadly now plans to spend his cash. Firstly, he will expand the capacity at Villa Park, \"from 39,000 seats to 51,000 seats\" (which, for a club that has an average attendance of under 29,000, must be regarded as a brilliant idea). Then Doug's going to build a Villa hotel, an idea which hasn't exactly caught alight in charming Chelsea.

Isn't synergy great?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>HE'S ALWAYS WRIGHT</strong></p> <p>Hmm. Just as we thought. Ian Wright has been reported to the Scottish Football Association for \"violent conduct towards the fourth official\" after his shove on Willie Young at the end of Celtic's match at Kilmarnock last weekend. The case will be referred to the SFA's kinky Disciplinary Committee, who may see Wright's actions as \"an exceptional case of player misconduct\" and administer a sound thrashing with a leather-bound rule book.</p> <p>Luckily for Ian, he has a column in the Scottish Sun, so it's a perfect opportunity to put over his side of the story. Remember, Ian - a wise man would be charming and contrite, thus avoiding punishment and possible flagellation. \"I did it, but have no regrets and my conscience is completely clear.\" Oh dear. \"I am not bothered about what punishment I may or may not be given.

This official was happy to keep shoving me but did not like it back.\"</p> <p>OK, you've said your bit, which is fair enough.

Hirst, 32, has hung up his boots on medical advice, having never recovered from tripping over a stone in 1998. Hirst was once the future of English football but persistent injury stopped him from ever reaching the heights. The Fiver would like to pay its tributes to the former Barnsley, Sheffield Wednesday and Southampton man by printing five hastily cobbled together facts below.</p> <p>David Hirst Memorial Fact 1: David Hirst is the sole cause for Manchester United's supremacy in the Nineties. When Alex Ferguson was looking for cover for the injured Dion Dublin in 1992, he approached Wednesday about signing Hirst but was rebuffed by 'manager' Trevor Francis. Fergie went off to Leeds instead and bought someone called Eric Cantona.</p> <p>DHMF 2: Hirst won three caps for England. His last came in a 2-0 victory against France in 1992. Despite the win, Hirst was never picked again. Funnily enough, neither was Geoff Thomas.</p> <p>DHMF 3: He scored in the 1993 FA Cup final in a 1-1 draw with Arsenal. Which means he is not really responsible for the most boring Wembley final since records began.</p> <p>DHMF 4: At \u00a32m, Hirst is still Southampton's record buy.</p> <p>DHMF 5: Which could explain something about Southampton.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Chelsea want to buy PSV striker Luc Nilis. They hope the deal will tempt his strike partner Ruud van Nistelrooy to join the club.</p> <p>Aston Villa want to sign Emile Heskey. They face competition from Liverpool, who are also chasing Barcelona's unsettled midfielder Jari Litmanen.</p> <p>Celtic are interested in Wimbledon and Scotland keeper Neil Sullivan, according to Teamtalk.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Bill Kenwright was today installed as the new owner of Everton. The one time Coronation Street actor has formally tabled his \u00a320m offer to buy the 68% controlling interest in Everton held by former chairman Peter Johnson. Johnson is locked into an 'irrevocable undertaking' to sell to Kenwright.</p> <p>Kanu has agreed a new four-year contract with Arsenal. He will sign the deal - thought to be around \u00a328,000 a week - when he returns from African Nations Cup duty with Nigeria.</p> <p>Newcastle's Silvio Maric has joined former club Croatia Zagreb on loan for the rest of the season.</p> <p>Aston Villa's England U-21 striker Darius Vassell has an ankle injury and will be out of action for at least a month.</p> <p>Kilmarnock hope to clinch the permanent signing of on-loan striker Andy Smith from Dunfermline by the weekend.</p> <p>Cambridge fans will protest against their city council before their club's FA Cup fifth-round tie at home to Bolton on Saturday. They claim Cambridge City Council are unreasonably blocking the redevelopment of the Abbey Stadium.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO</strong></p> <p>ITV: Football Extra (3.25am)</p> <p>You'll be sorry when you wake up late and half the day is wasted, you know.</p> <p>Channel 4: Football Italia (1.25am)</p> <p>Peter Brackley delivers thinly-veiled insults to the ex-footballer summarising alongside him, usually criticising their girth / lack of pace / lack of hair.</p> <p>Sky Sports 1: Inside Scottish Football (7pm, 11.30pm)</p> <p>Featuring Ian Wright, aka Wrighty, aka McWrighty, aka Wrighty MBE.</p> <p>You're On Sky Sports!

Hirst was once the future of English football but persistent injury stopped him from ever reaching the heights. The Fiver would like to pay its tributes to the former Barnsley, Sheffield Wednesday and Southampton man by printing five hastily cobbled together facts below. David Hirst Memorial Fact 1: David Hirst is the sole cause for Manchester United's supremacy in the Nineties. When Alex Ferguson was looking for cover for the injured Dion Dublin in 1992, he approached Wednesday about signing Hirst but was rebuffed by 'manager' Trevor Francis. Fergie went off to Leeds instead and bought someone called Eric Cantona. DHMF 2: Hirst won three caps for England. His last came in a 2-0 victory against France in 1992. Despite the win, Hirst was never picked again. Funnily enough, neither was Geoff Thomas. DHMF 3: He scored in the 1993 FA Cup final in a 1-1 draw with Arsenal. Which means he is not really responsible for the most boring Wembley final since records began. DHMF 4: At \u00a32m, Hirst is still Southampton's record buy. DHMF 5: Which could explain something about Southampton. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Chelsea want to buy PSV striker Luc Nilis. They hope the deal will tempt his strike partner Ruud van Nistelrooy to join the club. Aston Villa want to sign Emile Heskey. They face competition from Liverpool, who are also chasing Barcelona's unsettled midfielder Jari Litmanen. Celtic are interested in Wimbledon and Scotland keeper Neil Sullivan, according to Teamtalk. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Bill Kenwright was today installed as the new owner of Everton. The one time Coronation Street actor has formally tabled his \u00a320m offer to buy the 68% controlling interest in Everton held by former chairman Peter Johnson. Johnson is locked into an 'irrevocable undertaking' to sell to Kenwright. Kanu has agreed a new four-year contract with Arsenal. He will sign the deal - thought to be around \u00a328,000 a week - when he returns from African Nations Cup duty with Nigeria. Newcastle's Silvio Maric has joined former club Croatia Zagreb on loan for the rest of the season. Aston Villa's England U-21 striker Darius Vassell has an ankle injury and will be out of action for at least a month. Kilmarnock hope to clinch the permanent signing of on-loan striker Andy Smith from Dunfermline by the weekend. Cambridge fans will protest against their city council before their club's FA Cup fifth-round tie at home to Bolton on Saturday. They claim Cambridge City Council are unreasonably blocking the redevelopment of the Abbey Stadium. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: Football Extra (3.25am) You'll be sorry when you wake up late and half the day is wasted, you know.

Equipped with video machines and screens so he can watch other matches, the luxury coach will function as a travelling production office with \"all home comforts\", according to ITV. </p> <p>Brian Barwick, ITV's head of sport, said: \"Unlike the World Cup in France, Holland and Belgium present a slightly different challenge because by the time you've got to the airport you could be halfway to the next venue, so we decided to do it by road.\" </p> <p>Lynam's route has been mapped out by executives in a test run, and he will be making a practice tour by coach next month. \"This was the practical solution which gives the opportunity for Des to do every game live. We think he is such an important part in our Euro 2000 jigsaw that it's worth pulling out the stops to make sure he's there,\" Mr Barwick added. </p> <p>Lynam's worth to ITV will be tested by head to head opposition with BBC1, led by former colleagues Gary Lineker and Alan Hansen described as \"the nation's favourite team for football,\" by the BBC. BBC1 and ITV have joint television rights to the tournament and will split live coverage of the competition. They will broadcast the first round match between England and Germany on June 17 simultaneously, because of the historical rivalry of the fixture.

      "bodyText": "ITV unveiled its plans for Euro 2000 coverage yesterday with a novel solution to the question of how to ensure the ubiquity of Des Lynam. Lynam, ITV's face of football since defecting from the BBC last year, will travel around Holland and Belgium in a specially converted coach, nicknamed the Des-mobile. The bus has been developed to counter the problem of moving the anchorman to and from 10 live games at seven venues in 12 days. Equipped with video machines and screens so he can watch other matches, the luxury coach will function as a travelling production office with \"all home comforts\", according to ITV. Brian Barwick, ITV's head of sport, said: \"Unlike the World Cup in France, Holland and Belgium present a slightly different challenge because by the time you've got to the airport you could be halfway to the next venue, so we decided to do it by road.\" Lynam's route has been mapped out by executives in a test run, and he will be making a practice tour by coach next month. \"This was the practical solution which gives the opportunity for Des to do every game live. We think he is such an important part in our Euro 2000 jigsaw that it's worth pulling out the stops to make sure he's there,\" Mr Barwick added. Lynam's worth to ITV will be tested by head to head opposition with BBC1, led by former colleagues Gary Lineker and Alan Hansen described as \"the nation's favourite team for football,\" by the BBC. BBC1 and ITV have joint television rights to the tournament and will split live coverage of the competition. They will broadcast the first round match between England and Germany on June 17 simultaneously, because of the historical rivalry of the fixture. Should England reach the quarter final, that match will be shown by both channels. A BBC spokesman said the decision to show England v Germany on both channels at the same time was taken to avoid one station losing out.",

      "body": "<p>There comes a point with bad backs when your muscles go into excruciating spasm, the painkillers don't work, and you find yourself unable to move. Two years ago I was falling into this state more and more often. I had got used to waking up in pain, to the fact that bending down to put my knickers on in the morning would reduce me to tears and that the rest of the day would be spent hobbling around in thoroughly bad-tempered discomfort. But this chronic pain was increasingly being overtaken by days spent lying on the floor in agony. </p> <p>My general practitioner referred me for osteopathy, which helped the first time but not much thereafter. A locum prescribed tranquillisers for the acute episodes, to relax the muscles and get them out of spasm. This guaranteed two days in bed in a woozy sort of bliss, but I would come to with the pain and bad temper intact. Both doctors had been vague about a diagnosis of the problem. </p> <p>In desperation I tried a private appointment with a leading orthopaedic consultant. He was unaccountably abroad when I needed him, so I was seen by his brisk assistant, who took 15 minutes to tell me I had a terrible injury, should on no account lift my new-born baby for the next six months, should exercise in the sphinx position (don't ask), should write a cheque for \u00a375, should wear a corset, should for this write a further and separate cheque for \u00a335, and should book another \u00a375 appointment in a week's time. </p> <p>I still had no idea what the problem was, but the corset was a bit of a hit - the clubbers in the office admired the bright blue neoprene, though they weren't convinced it fitted with the rest of my south London housewife image. </p> <p>By now I had become a back bore, but there were plenty of other back bores around to swap details with, three within whispering distance in the office and any number of other mothers in the playground. The tedious thing about back pain is that nearly half the population suffers from it at some time: 40% of adults, or more than 16m people had back pain in 1998, according to new research published by the charity Back Care. </p> <p>The charity thinks as many as 180m working days a year may be lost because of back pain. Sitting for hours at computer screens and lifting small children (particularly in the first year after childbirth, when hormonal changes soften your ligaments) are classic triggers of back problems. I was doing both. (Much later I discovered that I had permanently damaged my sacro-iliac joint in the lower part of the spine.) </p> <p>I put up with the pain for nearly two years until a fellow back bore, who had worked her way through everything from physiotherapy to acupuncture without effect, recommended Pilates, and in particular a Pilates teacher called Lesley Ackland, who specialised in injuries. Now I am still a back bore, but one of the messianic kind, for I have found a cure. It has changed my life and I feel I have to constantly share this information. </p> <p>Joseph Pilates originally developed his system of remedial exercise in the 1920s, using pulleys and springs attached to hospital beds, to help injured troops in the first world war. He introduced it to New York, where it was taken up by the great choreographer George Balanchine to help his ballet dancers. It is now the fashionable exercise of Hollywood stars, and has become flavour of the month. The queue for Ackland's Body Maintenance studio has featured on Vogue's list of most desirable waiting lists. All of which sounds rather intimidating and would normally have been enough to put me off, but I was desperate. </p> <p> It is true that in a typical session you might be sharing equipment with a few exquisite and wounded ballerinas, half the cast of London's latest hit musical, or a fashion designer's muse, but you are just as likely to be sharing it with someone crippled by RSI, or doubled up with scoliosis, or with a lump like me, who hasn't exercised regularly since school. </p> <p>In the studio, where about eight people will be following an individual programme at any one time, there is an atmosphere of calm concentration, punctuated by raucous badinage and the latest gossip. </p> <p>By the time I had got to Lesley Ackland, I was a fairly typical wreck. I was frightened to move and I was compensating for the pain in my lower back by gripping other muscles. My shoulders were so tense they could have done service as earrings. My posture was terrible but I didn't have any stomach muscles to hold myself better and my pelvis was out of balance. And because I had lost all spontaneity of movement, I was putting even more pressure on my joints. I needed to develop the muscles to support my back to break the vicious circle. </p> <p>Like the best teachers, Ackland has a certain indefinable charisma and years of experience. She likes wrecks because they present her with an intellectual challenge. The first thing she did was give me confidence and show me I could move more than I thought without hurting. She taught me to breathe properly and then she devised a programme of simple exercises to stretch the muscles I had been over-tensing and to stengthen my abdominals, which act like a corset for the back and organs. I was able to ditch the neoprene support. </p> <p>The effect was almost immediate. I felt myself uncurling. After a few sessions I could feel what was wrong with my posture and at least begin to correct it. I quickly developed enough strength in other muscles to do the things I wanted without putting pressure on my back. Although it would build up between visits, at the end of an hour's exercise, the pain would miraculously have disappeared. </p> <p>On the whole, the exercises are very simple, and while they require concentration only a few need specialist equipment. Most I can do at home in between visits, and this week Lesley publishes a book for those who can't find a teacher near them. </p> <p>The exercises have seen me through my third pregnancy without significant problems and helped me get back into shape quickly. The damaged joint still aches on and off, but the grinding chronic pain is under control. I have never been able to stick at any exercise regime before, but now I go every week and would no more consider not doing my stretches than not brushing my teeth. If I take a holiday of more than two weeks, the pain returns and pain is a very effective goad. </p> <p>Like all treatments there are side effects, but with Pilates they happen to be rather nice ones: a flatter stomach, no more wobbly bottom and thighs, a transformed pelvic floor, and better sex. As life sentences go, it could be worse. </p> <p>\u0095 For a list of Pilates studios around the country, send an SAE to The Pilates Foundation, 80 Camden Road, London E17 7NF.

      "body": "<p>Just over a year ago, a teacher in Tennessee noticed what she described as \"a gasoline smell\" in her high-school classroom. Soon afterwards she felt ill. She had a headache and nausea, she couldn't breathe properly and felt dizzy. Several pupils developed similar symptoms. </p> <p>The classroom was evacuated and somebody set off the fire alarm to clear the school. Pupils and staff poured out of the building and watched as firefighters, police and emergency medical teams arrived from three counties, and the teacher and some of her pupils were taken away in an ambulance. </p> <p> All classes were cancelled. That day, 80 pupils, 19 staff and one relative who had come to pick up a child ended up in casualty; 38 of them were kept in hospital overnight. The school, Warren County High, in McMinnville, was only four years old. Built on farmland, it was virtually taken apart by the fire department, the local gas company and state officials of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. </p> <p>They found nothing. Hundreds of hours were spent on tests which came back negative. An aerial survey was conducted, local caves were explored, air, water and waste were examined, core samples were drilled from the ground around the school. Result? Nothing. </p> <p>But 186 people in all - there was a second outbreak and the school was closed again five days later - reported symptoms that most believed had been caused by some toxic environmental substance in the school. They all reported an unusual smell, although it was reported in 31 different places in the building. Those who said they smelled it had headaches, dizziness, nausea, drowsiness, tightness in the chest and difficulty breathing. Yet the tests carried out on them in hospital also found nothing. </p> <p> What was going on? Was this some stealthy toxic substance that leaked in, overcame pupils and staff and disappeared again? Scientists who have investigated the Warren County episode, writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, have now bitten the bullet and said what none of those affected will want to hear - that this was an outbreak of mass psychogenic illness. </p> <p>It doesn't mean that those who were rushed to hospital did not feel ill. They had real symptoms. But the underlying cause was not a toxic invisible gas, but the fear of one. They were made ill - genuinely ill - by anxiety. </p> <p>\"It is a social phenomenon, often occurring among otherwise healthy people, who suddenly believe they have been made ill by some external factor,\" write Timothy Jones and colleagues from the Epidemic Intelligence Service . Women and girls are more often affected than men and boys, they say (69% at Warren County). This outbreak had all the ingredients - an environmental scare, fire alarms, anxiety, a huge response from the emergency services which was witnessed by people who then became ill, and intense media speculation about what was going on. </p> <p>Despite all the reassurances and all the negative scientific reports, people from the school were still reporting persistent headaches more than a month after the outbreak. \"Some people believed that the investigation had simply failed to find the real cause of the illness. Paradoxically, in such circumstances, the observation of vigorous investigative activities may reinforce the suspicion that a genuine problem is being covered up,\" say the authors. </p> <p>This sort of phenomenon has been happening for as long as people have been afraid of events outside their control. \"People always believe they are oppressed. It is a question of who the oppressor is,\" said Simon Wessely, professor of epidemiological and liaison psychiatry at Guy's, King's &amp; St Thomas's School of Medicine in London. \"They seize on explanations that are credible and make sense within their world view: 300 years ago, people believed in possession by demons.\" </p> <p> These days, he writes in an editorial in the journal, those demons have been replaced by the evil spirits we most fear and do not understand today - \"our contemporary concern about invisible viruses, chemicals and toxins\". That we should be afraid is not surprising; the names of Seveso, Bhopal and Chernobyl are enough reason. But to that justifiable concern must be added a suspicion of authority, tainted with tales of cover-up. </p> <p>The Coca-Cola scare in Belgium last year was finally marked down as another of these episodes - this time christened mass sociogenic rather than psychogenic illness - in a bid to remove the \"in the mind\" tag which victims so much resent. They hate even more the older description of \"mass hysteria\" which was used of the Coca-Cola furore by Belgian doctors in the Lancet. </p> <p>That outbreak affected around 100 people, who complained of stomach cramps, nausea, headaches and palpitations. Millions of cans and bottles were withdrawn from sale. The whole thing cost is thought to have cost Coca-Cola some $900m. But it's not something they particularly want to talk about. They would prefer that people thought it was a minor factory problem which has been put right. The alternative is to say their customers were imagining things. They think they know which is the worse publicity. </p> <p>Are these outbreaks on the increase? Wessely doubts whether media reporting and the internet have caused an upsurge. \"I have a file going back 150 years. I'm tempted to say the internet hasn't increased them.

      "bodyText": "Just over a year ago, a teacher in Tennessee noticed what she described as \"a gasoline smell\" in her high-school classroom. Soon afterwards she felt ill. She had a headache and nausea, she couldn't breathe properly and felt dizzy. Several pupils developed similar symptoms. The classroom was evacuated and somebody set off the fire alarm to clear the school. Pupils and staff poured out of the building and watched as firefighters, police and emergency medical teams arrived from three counties, and the teacher and some of her pupils were taken away in an ambulance. All classes were cancelled. That day, 80 pupils, 19 staff and one relative who had come to pick up a child ended up in casualty; 38 of them were kept in hospital overnight. The school, Warren County High, in McMinnville, was only four years old. Built on farmland, it was virtually taken apart by the fire department, the local gas company and state officials of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. They found nothing. Hundreds of hours were spent on tests which came back negative. An aerial survey was conducted, local caves were explored, air, water and waste were examined, core samples were drilled from the ground around the school. Result? Nothing. But 186 people in all - there was a second outbreak and the school was closed again five days later - reported symptoms that most believed had been caused by some toxic environmental substance in the school. They all reported an unusual smell, although it was reported in 31 different places in the building. Those who said they smelled it had headaches, dizziness, nausea, drowsiness, tightness in the chest and difficulty breathing. Yet the tests carried out on them in hospital also found nothing. What was going on? Was this some stealthy toxic substance that leaked in, overcame pupils and staff and disappeared again? Scientists who have investigated the Warren County episode, writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, have now bitten the bullet and said what none of those affected will want to hear - that this was an outbreak of mass psychogenic illness. It doesn't mean that those who were rushed to hospital did not feel ill. They had real symptoms. But the underlying cause was not a toxic invisible gas, but the fear of one. They were made ill - genuinely ill - by anxiety. \"It is a social phenomenon, often occurring among otherwise healthy people, who suddenly believe they have been made ill by some external factor,\" write Timothy Jones and colleagues from the Epidemic Intelligence Service . Women and girls are more often affected than men and boys, they say (69% at Warren County). This outbreak had all the ingredients - an environmental scare, fire alarms, anxiety, a huge response from the emergency services which was witnessed by people who then became ill, and intense media speculation about what was going on. Despite all the reassurances and all the negative scientific reports, people from the school were still reporting persistent headaches more than a month after the outbreak. \"Some people believed that the investigation had simply failed to find the real cause of the illness. Paradoxically, in such circumstances, the observation of vigorous investigative activities may reinforce the suspicion that a genuine problem is being covered up,\" say the authors. This sort of phenomenon has been happening for as long as people have been afraid of events outside their control. \"People always believe they are oppressed. It is a question of who the oppressor is,\" said Simon Wessely, professor of epidemiological and liaison psychiatry at Guy's, King's &amp; St Thomas's School of Medicine in London. \"They seize on explanations that are credible and make sense within their world view: 300 years ago, people believed in possession by demons.\" These days, he writes in an editorial in the journal, those demons have been replaced by the evil spirits we most fear and do not understand today - \"our contemporary concern about invisible viruses, chemicals and toxins\". That we should be afraid is not surprising; the names of Seveso, Bhopal and Chernobyl are enough reason. But to that justifiable concern must be added a suspicion of authority, tainted with tales of cover-up. The Coca-Cola scare in Belgium last year was finally marked down as another of these episodes - this time christened mass sociogenic rather than psychogenic illness - in a bid to remove the \"in the mind\" tag which victims so much resent. They hate even more the older description of \"mass hysteria\" which was used of the Coca-Cola furore by Belgian doctors in the Lancet. That outbreak affected around 100 people, who complained of stomach cramps, nausea, headaches and palpitations. Millions of cans and bottles were withdrawn from sale. The whole thing cost is thought to have cost Coca-Cola some $900m. But it's not something they particularly want to talk about. They would prefer that people thought it was a minor factory problem which has been put right. The alternative is to say their customers were imagining things. They think they know which is the worse publicity. Are these outbreaks on the increase? Wessely doubts whether media reporting and the internet have caused an upsurge. \"I have a file going back 150 years. I'm tempted to say the internet hasn't increased them. At any time in human history there has been a new technology that has been a threat: it was believed that if the railways went too fast people would asphyxiate because they wouldn't be able to breathe.\" But it is possible that increasing fears of bioterrorism may precipitate more of them, particularly in the US. \"America has an obsession with chemical and biological terrorism,\" says Wessely, \"because the cold war is over and they don't have a proper enemy any more. There is a Hollywood agenda and it has developed its own legs. \"It is now a major public health concern and they are spending billions of dollars.\" Yet, he says, major chemical or biological attacks can only be carried out by armies, not individuals. \"The nutters aren't clever enough and the clever ones can't do it.\" He believes the psychological reaction to the fear could do more damage in social and economic terms than any possible chemical or biological attack is likely to. \"In the Tokyo subway attack seven people died.

So how do you deal with a mass psychogenic/sociogenic illness? That's a hard one. Too big a response, as at Warren Grange, and the anxiety levels and numbers falling ill increase.

      "body": "<p>Seven years a starlet, never a star? Hollywood's spin on \"Three times a bridesmaid, never a bride\" usually holds true. But Ashley Judd is proving the exception. For years she has been famous for her partners (Michael Bolton, Matthew McConaughey, Lyle Lovett, reputedly Robert De Niro), her parentage (the country-and-western Judds) and, yes, even her potential. Everything, in fact, except her movies. </p> <p>Hollywood-watchers have been forecasting that this would change ever since her debut in Ruby in Paradise, in 1993. Now, at last, it's happened. Double Jeopardy, an apparently unremarkable thriller, has taken $114m in the US alone. Judd's price was around $1m a movie after Kiss the Girls three years ago. Now it has soared to $4m or $5m. </p> <p>Judd almost never got her big break. Jodie Foster pipped her to the part in Double Jeopardy, but dropped out when she got pregnant. Paramount's preference for Foster was \"disappointing,\" Judd says, \"but it's not a casting choice you can argue with. It's not like being passed over for some talentless nitwit who hasn't won the studio two Oscars.\" </p> <p>In Double Jeopardy Judd plays a wife who is framed for her husband's murder and out for revenge against the pair who have wronged her. \"The film goes way beyond the traditional roles and behaviour of women in movies,\" she says stoutly. \"The part has a lot of spunk.\" </p> <p>One's a victim, the other a killer, but there is a certain similarity to the abused psychopath she plays in the yet-to-be-released Eye of the Beholder, opposite Ewan McGregor (\"a very sweet kid.\") Judd seems to have found her place, and it's wherever the poor ghosts of film noir hang out today. In practical terms that means she often winds up in violent or plot-heavy films (she was a woman living on the edge in Normal Life, and played bank robber Val Kilmer's girlfriend in Heat. She was cast in Natural Born Killers but wound up on the cutting room floor). </p> <p>There is a knowingness in her face, along with a Southern sweetness. In the flesh - tiny, with chestnut hair - she comes over as intensely focused. Double Jeopardy's director Bruce Beresford says she \"latches on to things\". Hers is the scary kind of low-key confidence you get among the religious of Hollywood. She is a committed Christian. \"All my life,\" she once said, \"I believed that things work to good for all those who are good and who love God.\" </p> <p>Stephan Elliott, who directed The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, had a Streep or Sarandon in mind for the role in Eye of the Beholder but says Judd \"basically stalked me. She hounded the hell out me for months. She would not give up.\" Talking to her, you sense that intensity. And anger, maybe. </p> <p> Judd disclaims much interest in the Hollywood star system. \"I don't know because I won't live there.\" She was an outsider long enough to see the game. \"I observe. I can usually understand the castings. The pecking order is standardised.\" </p> <p>Now the parts are coming thick and fast. With a couple of so far unseen pictures in the can, she has been signed up to make The Notebook for Jim Sheridan, a love story described as The English Patient meets Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe. There's talk of an adaptation of dating novel Animal Husbandry, and her name has been linked with everything from Charlie's Angels to the Basic Instinct sequel. </p> <p>Judd, aged 31, knows there's a danger that \"the more successful you become, the more focused you become on the single most elusive echelon of success.\" But she's already reached the place to which she aspired when starting out. She's holding that fact in mind. \"I know my interests are very much the same as they were back then - I like the same books and the same music - but what has changed is, I'm much more standoffish than I used to be. My love for any art is the same, but my disenchantment with the things contingent around it knows no bounds. </p> <p>\"If you get too involved with a sense of your own stardom, then you're really looking for personal disaster...\" She has, of course, the advantage of having seen fame \"first-hand and early\". She was 14 when the hardship of her early years changed to privilege. The combination has visibly made her what she is today. From a single mother dragging her two daughters around the South in search of work and living on welfare cheques, Naomi Judd and her elder daughter Wynonna became a country-and-western success story. Ashley Judd sang with the band occasionally, but her sights were always set on drama. And she maintains that in film, she still had to make her own way. </p> <p>\"When I went to Hollywood country music was not that big a deal on the West Coast. The way my background helped me was much more personal - I saw that money can't buy you happiness and that nothing is more important than a good night's sleep. I didn't go to Hollywood with a bunch of empty pipe dreams.\" </p> <p>Since her LA home burned down in the Malibu fires in 1996, Judd has been based on a 1,000-acre farm in Tennessee, within a mile of Wynonna and Naomi. She spends some time in Scotland with her current partner, racing driver Dario Franchitti. But basically, he's moved to Tennessee. There's a niece and a nephew there, a cat called Buttercup and a dog called Buttermilk. There may have been friction around Naomi Judd's autobiography, Love Can Build a Bridge, but if so, fences have been mended. \"Sister says she's going to write her own version of Mom's autobiography [sic] someday, and it's going to be called The Truth,\" Judd told American Elle - but tolerantly. </p> <p>Her new position is something \"for other people to deal with,\" she says. I just have to mind my personal life and my private interests and things that nourish me. I have a life. I've been lucky to have, a long time ago, a set of priorities that are more profound and long-lasting than having a movie that opens huge: personal fulfilment, a sense of peace and all of that.\" </p> <p>Double Jeopardy is on general release from Friday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Seven years a starlet, never a star? Hollywood's spin on \"Three times a bridesmaid, never a bride\" usually holds true. But Ashley Judd is proving the exception. For years she has been famous for her partners (Michael Bolton, Matthew McConaughey, Lyle Lovett, reputedly Robert De Niro), her parentage (the country-and-western Judds) and, yes, even her potential. Everything, in fact, except her movies. Hollywood-watchers have been forecasting that this would change ever since her debut in Ruby in Paradise, in 1993. Now, at last, it's happened. Double Jeopardy, an apparently unremarkable thriller, has taken $114m in the US alone. Judd's price was around $1m a movie after Kiss the Girls three years ago. Now it has soared to $4m or $5m. Judd almost never got her big break. Jodie Foster pipped her to the part in Double Jeopardy, but dropped out when she got pregnant. Paramount's preference for Foster was \"disappointing,\" Judd says, \"but it's not a casting choice you can argue with. It's not like being passed over for some talentless nitwit who hasn't won the studio two Oscars.\" In Double Jeopardy Judd plays a wife who is framed for her husband's murder and out for revenge against the pair who have wronged her. \"The film goes way beyond the traditional roles and behaviour of women in movies,\" she says stoutly. \"The part has a lot of spunk.\" One's a victim, the other a killer, but there is a certain similarity to the abused psychopath she plays in the yet-to-be-released Eye of the Beholder, opposite Ewan McGregor (\"a very sweet kid.\") Judd seems to have found her place, and it's wherever the poor ghosts of film noir hang out today. In practical terms that means she often winds up in violent or plot-heavy films (she was a woman living on the edge in Normal Life, and played bank robber Val Kilmer's girlfriend in Heat. She was cast in Natural Born Killers but wound up on the cutting room floor). There is a knowingness in her face, along with a Southern sweetness. In the flesh - tiny, with chestnut hair - she comes over as intensely focused. Double Jeopardy's director Bruce Beresford says she \"latches on to things\". Hers is the scary kind of low-key confidence you get among the religious of Hollywood. She is a committed Christian. \"All my life,\" she once said, \"I believed that things work to good for all those who are good and who love God.\" Stephan Elliott, who directed The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, had a Streep or Sarandon in mind for the role in Eye of the Beholder but says Judd \"basically stalked me. She hounded the hell out me for months. She would not give up.\" Talking to her, you sense that intensity. And anger, maybe. Judd disclaims much interest in the Hollywood star system. \"I don't know because I won't live there.\" She was an outsider long enough to see the game. \"I observe. I can usually understand the castings. The pecking order is standardised.\" Now the parts are coming thick and fast. With a couple of so far unseen pictures in the can, she has been signed up to make The Notebook for Jim Sheridan, a love story described as The English Patient meets Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe. There's talk of an adaptation of dating novel Animal Husbandry, and her name has been linked with everything from Charlie's Angels to the Basic Instinct sequel. Judd, aged 31, knows there's a danger that \"the more successful you become, the more focused you become on the single most elusive echelon of success.\" But she's already reached the place to which she aspired when starting out. She's holding that fact in mind. \"I know my interests are very much the same as they were back then - I like the same books and the same music - but what has changed is, I'm much more standoffish than I used to be. My love for any art is the same, but my disenchantment with the things contingent around it knows no bounds. \"If you get too involved with a sense of your own stardom, then you're really looking for personal disaster...\" She has, of course, the advantage of having seen fame \"first-hand and early\". She was 14 when the hardship of her early years changed to privilege. The combination has visibly made her what she is today. From a single mother dragging her two daughters around the South in search of work and living on welfare cheques, Naomi Judd and her elder daughter Wynonna became a country-and-western success story. Ashley Judd sang with the band occasionally, but her sights were always set on drama. And she maintains that in film, she still had to make her own way. \"When I went to Hollywood country music was not that big a deal on the West Coast. The way my background helped me was much more personal - I saw that money can't buy you happiness and that nothing is more important than a good night's sleep. I didn't go to Hollywood with a bunch of empty pipe dreams.\" Since her LA home burned down in the Malibu fires in 1996, Judd has been based on a 1,000-acre farm in Tennessee, within a mile of Wynonna and Naomi. She spends some time in Scotland with her current partner, racing driver Dario Franchitti. But basically, he's moved to Tennessee. There's a niece and a nephew there, a cat called Buttercup and a dog called Buttermilk. There may have been friction around Naomi Judd's autobiography, Love Can Build a Bridge, but if so, fences have been mended. \"Sister says she's going to write her own version of Mom's autobiography [sic] someday, and it's going to be called The Truth,\" Judd told American Elle - but tolerantly. Her new position is something \"for other people to deal with,\" she says. I just have to mind my personal life and my private interests and things that nourish me. I have a life. I've been lucky to have, a long time ago, a set of priorities that are more profound and long-lasting than having a movie that opens huge: personal fulfilment, a sense of peace and all of that.\" Double Jeopardy is on general release from Friday.",

      "bodyText": "Austria's far-right Freedom party announced last night that it would begin coalition talks with the conservatives, giving the party's leader, J\u00f6rg Haider, possibly the biggest break of his political career. Earlier Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, the foreign minister and head of the conservative People's party - the junior partner in the former administration - said a stable government could not be formed without the Freedom party. His comment, carried in today's Austrian newspapers, was a response to the collapse of talks last Friday aimed at renewing the traditional coalition between his party and the leading Social Democrats. After a three-hour meeting last night, the Freedom party leadership said talks with the People's party should last between a week and 10 days, and that failure would pave the way for fresh elections to resolve the political deadlock since inconclusive elections nearly four months ago. Asked whether he would seek the chancellorship, Mr Haider said his party favoured him for the post but he was inclined to stay on as governor of Carinthia province. The gridlock has paved the way for Mr Haider to enter government, despite international concern about his politics, particularly his pro-Nazi remarks. He has been candid about his desire to become chancellor. In his newspaper commentary, Mr Sch\u00fcssel said: \"A stable government is... still possible, either by a coalition between the Social Democrats and the Freedom party or a coalition between the People's party and the Freedom party.\" His party's general secretary, Maria Rauch-Kallat, told today's Die Presse newspaper that she expected talks with the FPO to begin today, \"in order that new elections and an unstable situation can be avoided\". President Thomas Klestil, the kingmaker, is still desperate to keep Mr Haider out of government, fearing the harm he could do to Austria's international image and economy. He still backs attempts by the acting chancellor, Viktor Klima, to form a minority government of his Social Democrats with likely support from the Greens. Mr Klima has so far ruled out a coalition with the Freedom party. Both the conservatives and the Freedom party have opposed such an administration. But after four hours of talks with Mr Klestil on Friday, Mr Haider revealed that he sought to form a government. In parliamentary elections on October 3 the Social Democrats won 65 of the 183 seats - finishing first but without enough support to form a majority government. Mr Haider's party, whose platform opposed immigration and rapid European Union expansion, finished second, just ahead of the conservatives in votes. Both hold 52 seats; the Greens have 14. The conservatives had ruled out a coalition with Mr Haider, but newspapers had reported secret backroom discussions with the far-right party - denied by both parties. Analysts said Mr Sch\u00fcssel would have much to gain by joining forces with Mr Haider. His party was under the thumb of the Social Democrats in their 13-year coalition. President Klestil has come under widespread attack for seeming to disregard the will of the electorate by insisting on a return to the traditional alliance for stability's sake. \"He is ignoring the fact that so many people chose the Free dom party and, however much he tries to suppress that fact, it is not going to go away,\" a constitutional expert said.

      "body": "<p><strong><a name=\"\" a>Finding a job</a></strong> </p> <p>'The English language is hugely valued here,' says Lynn Jenkins, a director of one of the English Language Institute Schools in Seville, of English teaching in Spain. 'The TEFL market is booming and the opportunities for career progression are improving.' </p> <p>Teachers have a huge variety of schools to choose from in Spain. There are the big players at the cutting edge of language instruction such as International House centres. New arrivals include the mushrooming numbers of Wall Street and OpenIng schools offering individuated multimedia programmes of study. At the other end of the scale are the small academies providing extra-curricular lessons to local school children - sometimes run on tiny budgets by people with a very paternalistic view of their responsibilities as employers. </p> <p>The best times to apply for posts vary from city to city. On the whole, directors of study will be looking to plug gaps from June onwards but they probably will not have a clear idea of student numbers until September and it is then they will start the major teacher recruitment drive. Madrid schools want to hear from teachers in early September and the advice is to follow up your CV with a telephone call to see that it has been received safely. According to Nick Eperon, a TEFL teacher in Seville, it has become much harder to find jobs at schools in the city: 'to get a good post you will need several year's experience and qualifications.' At the Language Institute Schools in Seville they sift through the CVs in May and June. Many of their candidates are already teaching in Spain and take a long weekend break to travel down to Andalusia for interview. </p> <p>If you are looking for vacancies, the best places to look are the key TEFL magazines and the internet. Most of the big school chains in Spain have their own web pages. If you are already in town, there are local versions of the Yellow Pages to help your research. </p> <p>It is entirely possible to train as a language teacher in Spain itself. 'For some it is a cheaper option to study for the Certificate [in teaching English as a foreign language] at the International House here in Madrid,' says course tutor Paul Murphy. 'And if you do the course in September, there is the chance you will find yourself work immediately on qualifying.' </p> <p>'One of the biggest adjustments an English teacher new to Spain has to make is to the shape of the working day,' explains Lynne Jenkins. 'Spaniards fit their language lessons in around their day-time work or schooling and so this can mean early starts and late ends if teachers are unlucky.' This point is echoed by Paul Murphy in Madrid. 'People need to check their hours carefully and spot if there is an awkward gap in the middle of the day splitting their timetable. It is not unheard of for people to start at 8am and finish at 10pm. There is a law in Spain that employers cannot ask people to work times that deny them twelve clear hours off in every 24.' </p> <p>One of the biggest markets for English lessons is among young adults between 18 and 30, but most schools cater for a wide diversity of age groups. Most language schools receive an influx of school children after 4.30pm once their main school day is done. According to Paul Murphy it is important for teachers to be flexible. 'You cannot guarantee that your students are going to be grown up and as many of the children you do see have been drummed into attending language lessons by their parents there are inevitably some discipline problems to contend with. Many are there under duress and after a long day in school.'

      "bodyText": "Finding a job 'The English language is hugely valued here,' says Lynn Jenkins, a director of one of the English Language Institute Schools in Seville, of English teaching in Spain. 'The TEFL market is booming and the opportunities for career progression are improving.' Teachers have a huge variety of schools to choose from in Spain. There are the big players at the cutting edge of language instruction such as International House centres. New arrivals include the mushrooming numbers of Wall Street and OpenIng schools offering individuated multimedia programmes of study. At the other end of the scale are the small academies providing extra-curricular lessons to local school children - sometimes run on tiny budgets by people with a very paternalistic view of their responsibilities as employers. The best times to apply for posts vary from city to city. On the whole, directors of study will be looking to plug gaps from June onwards but they probably will not have a clear idea of student numbers until September and it is then they will start the major teacher recruitment drive. Madrid schools want to hear from teachers in early September and the advice is to follow up your CV with a telephone call to see that it has been received safely. According to Nick Eperon, a TEFL teacher in Seville, it has become much harder to find jobs at schools in the city: 'to get a good post you will need several year's experience and qualifications.' At the Language Institute Schools in Seville they sift through the CVs in May and June. Many of their candidates are already teaching in Spain and take a long weekend break to travel down to Andalusia for interview. If you are looking for vacancies, the best places to look are the key TEFL magazines and the internet. Most of the big school chains in Spain have their own web pages. If you are already in town, there are local versions of the Yellow Pages to help your research. It is entirely possible to train as a language teacher in Spain itself. 'For some it is a cheaper option to study for the Certificate [in teaching English as a foreign language] at the International House here in Madrid,' says course tutor Paul Murphy. 'And if you do the course in September, there is the chance you will find yourself work immediately on qualifying.' 'One of the biggest adjustments an English teacher new to Spain has to make is to the shape of the working day,' explains Lynne Jenkins. 'Spaniards fit their language lessons in around their day-time work or schooling and so this can mean early starts and late ends if teachers are unlucky.' This point is echoed by Paul Murphy in Madrid. 'People need to check their hours carefully and spot if there is an awkward gap in the middle of the day splitting their timetable. It is not unheard of for people to start at 8am and finish at 10pm. There is a law in Spain that employers cannot ask people to work times that deny them twelve clear hours off in every 24.' One of the biggest markets for English lessons is among young adults between 18 and 30, but most schools cater for a wide diversity of age groups. Most language schools receive an influx of school children after 4.30pm once their main school day is done. According to Paul Murphy it is important for teachers to be flexible. 'You cannot guarantee that your students are going to be grown up and as many of the children you do see have been drummed into attending language lessons by their parents there are inevitably some discipline problems to contend with. Many are there under duress and after a long day in school.' A good rule of thumb is to expect twelve people in adult classes and 10 in children's lessons. Another variation on the theme occurs when parents' associations approach language institutes and arrange for a teacher to travel out to give lessons to pupils at their local school. Similar arrangements occur between language centres and prominent businesses. 'Travelling time is an important issue when you are evaluating your contract,' warns Paul Murphy.

      "body": "<p>John Lasseter walked into his suite in a London hotel this week with two superstars tucked under his arm. Or at least, toy versions of two superstars, Woody and Buzz Lightyear. They rocketed to fame five years ago in Toy Story, the first full-length computer-animated feature, and now they're going to infinity and beyond in Toy Story 2, cheered on by a genial, soft-spoken geek in a Hawaiian-style Woody-themed shirt. </p> <p>Lasseter, who directed both movies, doesn't need to be told that Toy Story 2 is one of the few sequels that's better than the original. In the US it grossed \u00a335m in its first three days. In box office terms, that put Toy Story 2 in fourth place on the all-time list. </p> <p>The film is a virtually perfect merchandising vehicle. Mr Potato Head, Slinky Dog, Barrel of Monkeys, Etch-A-Sketch, Barbie and other favourites don't just appear in scenes thanks to back-room product placement deals: they're integral to the story. The Toy Story 2 computer game has already been launched, and the spin-offs will ultimately generate far more money than the cinema screenings. Three successes in a row - A Bug's Life was the other - have established Lasseter as the Walt Disney of the computer age. Indeed, it was in the Walt Disney feature animation division that he learned his trade for five years after he graduated from university until, in 1984, fascinated by computer graphics, he left to join Pixar Animation Studios. But, as Lasseter is the first to admit, the computers are a means to an end. </p> <p>\"To me the story and the characters are the most important things,\" he says. \"They dictate technical development, everything. The goal is to let the audience get swept away, and not really think about the technology.\" Disney would certainly have agreed with that. But the computer animation is still important. \"I fell in love with the imagery you could achieve,\" Lasseter says. \"Truly 3-D images that have shadows and reflections and textures.\" </p> <p>Where Lasseter differs from the special-effects people is that he's not trying to fool you into thinking something is real when it's not. Rex, Lasseter's neurotic toy dinosaur, for instance, wouldn't cut it in Jurassic Park. \"We'll always stay in the caricature world,\" he says. \"If you make sure that the audience knows the world you're creating doesn't exist, then you can use this photorealistic technology and make it seem as believable as possible. The magic is that the audience can sit there and say: 'I know this doesn't exist, but boy, it sure looks real!'\" </p> <p>Making it look real requires huge amounts of computer power and a lot of attention to detail. \"Toy Story 2 exists in a bigger world than Toy Story, and that's due to increases in computer power. The street scenes, the airport, the baggage area: those are things we could not have done five years ago,\" Lasseter says. \"In hand-drawn animation, when a character goes into a new environment, it's just a new painting that's created. With us, as long as the characters stay in the same environment, it's like a live action set built within the computer. But in Toy Story 2 the toys get out on the road and go from place to place, and each time they go to a new place we have to build a whole new set.\" </p> <p>The extra computer power allows more imperfections to be introduced to the \"sets\". According to Lasseter, \"inherently the computer likes to make things perfect: perfectly clean, perfect edges, flat. It's very geometric - which is why people have said in the past that computer graphics look cold. So we put a tremendous amount of effort into making things have nicks, and there are bumps and nicks and marks all over the place.\" </p> <p>If you love computer graphics you'll have a lot of fun looking out for the litter and dust, the way an earlier generation watched the shadows move in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. And there's more fun to be had spotting references to Star Wars, Forrest Gump and other blockbusters. \"We love movies,\" Lasseter says. \"We put those references in for the pure fun of it. If people get them, great, and if they don't, well, it doesn't ruin the story.\" </p> <p>The stage must be set for Toy Story 3 - an exciting prospect, since, unlike traditional film directors, Lasseter can look forward to having ever better tools to work with.</p> <p> Toy Story 2 is on general release from February 4.</p>",

The choice is between working in a school where you can get block hours but these tend to be kids' classes or going for business clients which leads to a more disjointed timetable.

      "bodyText": "'There are training sessions every Friday, and teachers who have travelled to hear language teaching gurus such as Mario Rinvolucri or Jane Ravel give one of their road show talks will offer inset classes to bring everyone up to speed... Seville has taken off since the 'Expo' was held here in 1992 - quite apart from all the infrastructure built at the time including the airport, it really opened landladies' minds about the quality of the accommodation they offered. Places are far better furnished now. At first it seemed very quiet but with the spring, Seville moves outside and the Holy Week celebrations and the Feria Fair in April are spectacular. If you come here it is obligatory to enrol at dance school and learn how to perform sevillanas.' Lynn Jenkins came to Spain 14 years ago and is currently the director of the English Language Institute in the Macarena district of Seville. 'Barcelona is a great city - everything you could want in a small space. Getting to know Catalans may take longer but relationships seem to be more durable... You have to be flexible. At some point in the week you may be giving a one-to-one class to a senior executive in a plush office and then later you will be with a gaggle of school children... The choice is between working in a school where you can get block hours but these tend to be kids' classes or going for business clients which leads to a more disjointed timetable.

They were warned by the judge, Mr Justice Forbes, not to make contact with each other overnight to discuss the case, nor to talk about it to anyone else.</p> <p>The press benches and the public gallery were packed at the beginning of the day as the jury filed out of their seats at 10.37am carrying black court files and their own pads of notes.</p> <p>Some left behind the red cushions that had given them some comfort while sitting for extended periods on the hard wooden benches.</p> <p>Dr Shipman, sat in the brass-railed dock in the panelled courtroom between two prison officers, with his wife Primrose and son Richard in the gallery behind him. Nearby sat relatives of some of Shipman's alleged victims. Senior detectives who had led the inquiry were also in court.</p> <p>The crown alleges that Dr Shipman, 54, whose practice is in Hyde, Greater Manchester, killed 15 of his female patients between 1995 and 1998 by injecting them with lethal doses of diamorphine.</p> <p>During the trial the court heard that traces of morphine were found in nine bodies that were exhumed.

      "bodyText": "The jury trying Harold Shipman, the family doctor accused of murdering 15 of his patients, will resume their deliberations today as they try to reach verdicts after hearing evidence for 10 weeks. At the end of the 52nd day of the trial at Preston crown court yesterday, the seven men and five women were sent home after meeting in their room for five and a half hours. They were warned by the judge, Mr Justice Forbes, not to make contact with each other overnight to discuss the case, nor to talk about it to anyone else. The press benches and the public gallery were packed at the beginning of the day as the jury filed out of their seats at 10.37am carrying black court files and their own pads of notes. Some left behind the red cushions that had given them some comfort while sitting for extended periods on the hard wooden benches. Dr Shipman, sat in the brass-railed dock in the panelled courtroom between two prison officers, with his wife Primrose and son Richard in the gallery behind him. Nearby sat relatives of some of Shipman's alleged victims. Senior detectives who had led the inquiry were also in court. The crown alleges that Dr Shipman, 54, whose practice is in Hyde, Greater Manchester, killed 15 of his female patients between 1995 and 1998 by injecting them with lethal doses of diamorphine. During the trial the court heard that traces of morphine were found in nine bodies that were exhumed. The prosecution claims six other women, whose bodies were cremated, were murdered the same way. It said Dr Shipman killed them because he enjoyed having the power of life and death over them. The prosecution also says that Dr Shipman forged the will of Kathleen Grundy, an 81-year-old former mayoress of Hyde, in order to benefit from her \u00a3386,000 estate. He denies all the charges. Wearing a light brown suit and striped tie, Dr Shipman watched as the judge completed his summing-up, which had lasted almost 50 hours spread over two weeks. Mr Justice Forbes reminded the jury members that the burden of proof had rested on the prosecution for the entire duration of the trial and that they had to be sure of Shipman's guilt. \"Nothing else will do,\" he said. Dr Shipman did not have to prove anything. He also reminded them to judge the case only on the evidence. \"You must not speculate or be drawn into speculation,\" he told them. \"You must put out of your mind anything that you may have heard, read or seen outside the court.\" The judge asked for unanimous verdicts and added: \"These counts do not stand or fall together. You must deliver a separate verdict in respect of each count on this indictment.\" The press and public remained in the court lobby until 4.17pm when the clerk summoned the jury back so that members could be sent home.",

In 1997, the generals decided their government's name, the state law and order restoration council - Slorc - sounded too harsh, so they renamed it the state peace and development council.</p> <p>Other alterations include formally renaming the country Myanmar. Rangoon has become Yangon.</p> <p>Few countries choose to trade with Burma and tough sanctions remain in force against it. But despite the lack of funds, the generals spend more than a third of the national budget on the military while more than 25% of the population is fighting for survival below the poverty line.</p> <p>Burma's most lucrative export is heroin.

On her return to Britain she described how she had been subjected to pyschological abuse.

He was inspired by Aung San Suu Kyi to work non-violently for democracy in Burma.

She was put under house arrest but continued to campaign from her gilded cage. The following year, in 1991, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize but democracy remains an elusive dream. Pro-democracy campaigners are still regularly imprisoned on the flimsiest of pretexts and free elections are unlikely to be held for decades. The only changes have been cosmetic. In 1997, the generals decided their government's name, the state law and order restoration council - Slorc - sounded too harsh, so they renamed it the state peace and development council. Other alterations include formally renaming the country Myanmar. Rangoon has become Yangon. Few countries choose to trade with Burma and tough sanctions remain in force against it. But despite the lack of funds, the generals spend more than a third of the national budget on the military while more than 25% of the population is fighting for survival below the poverty line. Burma's most lucrative export is heroin. Last week the generals took foreign journalists to a site where acres of opium poppies were being destroyed and 50,000 people resettled. But, as with the name changes, few people believe it will result in any substantial improvements. The country's intolerance of interference in its affairs is reflected by the seven years' hard labour imposed on a British protester, Rachel Goldwyn, 28, for singing a pro-democracy song in the street. She was freed after serving two months. On her return to Britain she described how she had been subjected to pyschological abuse. A fellow human rights protester, Ko Aung, had been kept in a 20ft-deep pit for six days with a rotting human corpse. Another Briton, James Mawdsley, 26, is serving a 17-year sentence in Kengtung prison for distributing anti-government literature. Mr Mawdsley had been arrested on two previous occasions in Burma but was released after promising never to return. He has said he was tortured during his second arrest, when he was released after 99 days in solitary confinement. He was inspired by Aung San Suu Kyi to work non-violently for democracy in Burma. After he was sentenced in September, he decided not to appeal.

The third-in-command is even younger than the twins, a boy who earned the title Black Tongue after suffering a deforming tropical illness. All three boys are heavy smokers, but otherwise they lead a highly regulated life. Alcohol, swearing, pork and eggs are among the items the young fundamental Christians have banned. There are also thought to be strict rules about liaisons with the opposite sex. The boys were not believed to have been among the guerrillas at the hospital yesterday. But observers of the God's Army detected their stamp on rebel demands. Yesterday's drama began at 7.30am when a group of adult God's Army soldiers arrived at the hospital after a 40-mile journey on a hijacked bus from the Burmese border. About 200 staff and 700 patients and visitors were taken hostage. \"We want to tell the world how the Karen and Burmese refugees live during the fighting,\" one of the guerrillas, named Nui, said. \"Do not be worried. We will not hurt any hostages.\" About 450 people were freed in batches - mostly the elderly, women and children - or managed to escape from eight outlying buildings during the course of the day and night. The Thais made some concessions during the afternoon. Lt Gen Taweep, the regional army chief, said that shelling of God's Army positions would stop, and that unarmed refugees could enter Thailand for medical treatment. However he stressed that no Thai doctors would be sent into Burma, and no one carrying weapons could enter Thailand. Mr Harmer said that the situation on the border must be desperate for the God's Army insurgents to have resorted to seizing the hospital. \"If they've been driven to this they must have taken a real pounding. They could well be on the brink of oblivion,\" he said. \"They're probably existing on very little.\" Useful links The Karens Karen.org Karen National Union The Burmese government view Burmese foreign ministry Myanmar.com Myanmar-information.net International sites Free Burma.org CIA World Factbook: Burma Amnesty International reports on Burma Thailand Royal Thai police CIA World Factbook: Thailand Royal Thai army",

Willoughby began with 4-42 as EP, replying to Boland's 193, disintegrated to 87 all out. Boland then folded to 104 for 7 before a late rally lifted them to 232, setting EP an unlikely 339 for victory. That they even got close was thanks to 118 from David Callaghan, but it was Willoughby who stole the headlines with 5-87.</p> <p><strong>Boland</strong> 193 and 232 (Justin Kemp 4-30) <strong>Eastern Province</strong> 87 and 328<br> <strong>Boland won by 10 runs </strong></p> <p>Vasbert Drakes was in the wickets again as Border wallopped Western Province by an innings at East London.

Venter put on 144 for the first wicket with Boeta Dippenaar (56) and then added a further 93* with Johannes van der Wath (59*) as FS romped home by nine wickets with 14 balls to spare.

First Astle made 122 in the win over Wellington in Christchurch, putting on 153 for the 2nd wicket with Stephen Fleming (60). Then he hit 109 to see off Otago at Invercargill. Canterbury completed a third win when Fleming hit 90 to overhaul Northern Districts, after Astle had taken 4-52. </p> <p>Mathew Sinclair, who will forever be remembered as the man who hit a double-century on Test debut, had to settle for 110 as Central Districts squeezed out Otago in the bottom-of-the-table clash at Oamaru.

Michael made 111 and Neal 54 in a second-wicket stand of 114 as ND ran up 280 for 7, but Richard Petrie smashed 78* from just 54 balls, including five fours and five sixes, to win it for Wellington with one ball to spare. Petrie added 16* for the tenth wicket with Robert Kennedy, who didn't face a ball.

CD ran up 305 for 6, but Otago then opened with a stand of 120 for the first wicket before falling away. CD were then put in their place by 145 from Auckland's Vincent in a 75-run defeat at Napier, and were humbled again when Wellington dismissed them for 114, with Richard Petrie taking 4-26. The Parlane brothers, Michael and Neal, shared their second century partnership of the competition, but couldn't prevent Northern Districts going down to Wellington by one wicket in Whangarei. Michael made 111 and Neal 54 in a second-wicket stand of 114 as ND ran up 280 for 7, but Richard Petrie smashed 78* from just 54 balls, including five fours and five sixes, to win it for Wellington with one ball to spare. Petrie added 16* for the tenth wicket with Robert Kennedy, who didn't face a ball. Earlier, Matthew Bell made 70.

The decision came as Germany's Christian Democrat Union (CDU) revealed that the total amount of untraceable funds on its books had reached almost DM29m (\u00a39m). The sum is higher than the party had previously acknowledged. But the alleged secret contribution from France was not included in the accounts disclosed yesterday, so the total may go much higher. Pledging to cleanse the party's financial arrangements, the CDU's leader, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, said the way it had gathered its revenue under his predecessor, Mr Kohl, was a \"violation not only of the party funding laws, but of German democracy\". But the scandal is now about more even than that. The alleged French contribution raises the question of whether Europe's recent, rapid integration - largely a product of the Kohl-Mitterrand alliance - was bought on the sly. The alleged French donation was reported to have been generated from commission on the sale of Leuna, an east German oil refinery, to the French oil consortium Elf Aquitaine. A spokesman for the prosecutors' office in Paris said that an investigation into Elf's dealings had not so far found a link with illegal funding for the German CDU. But in Berlin, the head of a parliamentary inquiry into the funding scandal said it would be looking at the possibility of a French connection. \"We shall expand the focus of the inquiry,\" said Volker Neumann, a Social Democrat MP. \"We don't have any evidence for now, but we must investigate this. It seems to me unthinkable that one European state would use public money to try to influence an election in a neighbouring state - but in this world one can never be sure\".

      "bodyText": "The personal and political drama surrounding the six-year-old Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez escalated to a new level of intensity yesterday as his two grandmothers unexpectedly travelled to visit the boy in Miami and local Republican politicians announced moves to make him a US citizen. The grandmothers' visit to the US to press for the refugee boy's return to his father in Cuba had been confined to New York and Washington and there had been no indication that the two women would enter the lions' den of the Cuban exile community in Florida to meet Elian. Yesterday, Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana decided to fly from New York to Miami for an encounter with their grandson in the early evening. Though details of the meeting were still being worked out as the two women left New York, it appeared that the encounter would take place with the blessing of both sides in the tug-of-love battle and that the grandmothers would then return to Cuba, probably today. There were no indications that Elian would accompany them back to Havana. Florida's Republican senator, Connie Mack, announced in Washington yesterday that he will try this week to intro duce legislation in the US Congress to grant full citizenship to Elian, who was found clinging to a rubber tyre in December after a boat crammed with Cuban refugees, including his mother and stepfather, sank off the Florida coast. The case has evolved into a full-blown political confrontation between Cuba, where 150,000 people rallied on Saturday calling for Elian to be returned to his father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and the US, where the power and wealth of the Cuban community around Miami has galvanised opponents of the Castro regime to try to keep the boy in the US at all costs. The grandmothers arrived in the US last week as guests of the American National Council of Churches, which has played a leading role in trying to secure Elian Gonzalez's return to Cuba. After meetings in New York on Friday, the women went to Washington on Saturday to tell the US attorney general, Janet Reno - who is a Miami Democratic Party politician - that \"they are suffering\" over the stand-off over the boy's future. The women gave Ms Reno a letter expressing the wish that Elian \"be returned to the normality of life with his father, brother, family, schoolfriends, his toys, dog and parrot\". Ms Reno, who has supported a US Immigration and Naturalisation Service(INS) ruling that Elian should be returned to his father, said that the two women \"made a compassionate and heartfelt plea\", but she told them that the matter was with the US federal courts.

He said talks had been going to prepare for the encounter. Sen Mack announced yesterday that he would be introducing citizenship legislation in the senate this week, and that a similar move would start soon in the House of Representatives. The campaign to keep Elian Gonzalez in the US has been embraced by many Republicans and some Democrats, and has become a touchstone issue in Florida politics. Governor Jeb Bush is the brother of Republican presidential front-runner George W Bush and the state faces an important presidential primary election on February 14. George W Bush said in an interview in Iowa at the weekend that granting Elian citizenship \"would be a wonderful gesture\". He added that the boy's father should come to the US to \"get a taste of freedom\". Mr Mack's move was immediately condemned by Ms Rodriguez, who asked congress members not to give the boy US citizenship and to let him return to Cuba. \"It will be more painful if he gets the citizenship.

      "body": "<p>Lots of nasty things were said about Eric Nicoli last spring when he popped up as the boss of what was then routinely referred to as \"embattled music group\" <a href=\"http://www.emi.com/\">EMI</a>. </p> <p>This business needed a heavy hitter, not someone from a company like <a href=\"http://www.unitedbiscuits.co.uk/\">United Biscuits</a>, which had underperformed the market by 80% since he became chief executive. At least he would know all about bid speculation, ran the joke at the time. </p> <p>Sure enough, EMI quickly entered talks with <a href=\"http://www.seagram.com/\">Seagram</a>, but the deal apparently fell down because the EMI board was just too embarrassed to sell the company at less than than 700p a share, at which its was demerged from the Thorn group in 1997. </p> <p>Shareholders were not given a chance to vote on that matter; instead they are now being asked to approve such a convoluted carving up of the business that only a cocktail of Warburg Dillon Read, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Wasserstein Perella could have come up with it. </p> <p>EMI's core music business is being combined with Time Warner's in not one but two 50:50 ventures, together called Warner EMI Music. This is said to be for tax reasons, with the joint ventures having identical boards. </p> <p>\"Old\" EMI remains as a British-listed company, comprising the stake in the joint ventures and its holdings in HMV Media, Viva and Channel 5, while direc tors' blushes over the historical 700p share price target are addressed with a 100p cash-back promise to shareholders. </p> <p>Accompanying this, Time Warner gets an incentive to maximise EMI's share price performance in the form of the right to buy 8% of the British firm if it can keep the stock above 900p, post-100p cash back, for any two weeks in the next three and a half years. Meanwhile, on this side of the Atlantic, EMI's directors have simply promised not to engage in any new business outside Warner EMI Music this side of 2004. </p> <p>Confused? Well, joint-deputy chairman Sir Peter Walters and the other non-executives on the remuneration committee - Sir Dominic Cadbury, Harald Einsmann, Hugh Jenkins and Kathleen O'Donovan - had no problems at all. They have waved the deal through as a straightforward \"change of control\", so everyone at the top of the firm gets to see the shares and options sitting awarded as long-term incentives turned into short-term readies. Mr Nicoli has clearly got his head screwed on, but sadly it is not pointing in the direction of his regular shareholders. </p> <p><strong> Force required </strong><br> </p> <p> Peter Kindersley may soon need to consult one of his own dictionaries to discover when lots of \"one-off\" disasters should more accurately be described as a litany of disaster. </p> <p>The latest warning from his children's book publishing group seems to be one of the worst yet, and has already claimed the scalp of chief executive James Middlehurst. Dorling Kindersley is expecting to lose \u00a325m after having grossly overestimated the number of Star Wars books it was likely to sell in the peak pre-Christmas period. It shifted only 3m out of 13m printed, a result many lay people could have predicted as most cinema-goers have long since moved on to new pastures. </p> <p>Even if this fits Mr Kindersley's definition of \"one-off\", the other horrors lurking in the trading statement do not. The firm, now reliant on generous treatment from its bankers, is badly misjudging its stock control - it has \u00a344m of unsold goods in warehouses - and has taken too long to come to grips with the need to establish a more reliable distribution arrangement in the UK. The group cannot afford, as happened last September, to fail to get its books on to the shelves of an important retailer like WH Smith. </p> <p>Dorling Kindersley should be sitting pretty - it is developing a good multimedia offering, has an amazingly strong brand, a credibly strong presence in the American market and is smack-bang in the middle of one of the most promising media sectors - education. </p> <p>But that franchise is persistently un dermined by management ineptitude. In its record since joining the stock market in 1992, there has been one constant, Peter Kindersley, who leapt straight back into the driving seat yesterday. </p> <p>His strong identification with the company - he founded it and still speaks for nearly a third of the shares - should be an advantage. </p> <p>But it is hard to escape the conclusion that he is part of the problem. He had to be prised out of the role of chairman and chief executive and remains executive chairman. Regardeless of whether the board complies with the rules of corporate governance, it is lacking in heavyweight independents to act as a counterweight to Mr Kindersley. </p> <p>The chances of attracting a new chief executive of calibre can only be aided by a promise to strengthen the board. Either that, or Mr Kindesley's advisers should find a buyer for the firm, before the \u00a31 bookshops are overwhelmed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Lots of nasty things were said about Eric Nicoli last spring when he popped up as the boss of what was then routinely referred to as \"embattled music group\" EMI. This business needed a heavy hitter, not someone from a company like United Biscuits, which had underperformed the market by 80% since he became chief executive. At least he would know all about bid speculation, ran the joke at the time. Sure enough, EMI quickly entered talks with Seagram, but the deal apparently fell down because the EMI board was just too embarrassed to sell the company at less than than 700p a share, at which its was demerged from the Thorn group in 1997. Shareholders were not given a chance to vote on that matter; instead they are now being asked to approve such a convoluted carving up of the business that only a cocktail of Warburg Dillon Read, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Wasserstein Perella could have come up with it. EMI's core music business is being combined with Time Warner's in not one but two 50:50 ventures, together called Warner EMI Music. This is said to be for tax reasons, with the joint ventures having identical boards. \"Old\" EMI remains as a British-listed company, comprising the stake in the joint ventures and its holdings in HMV Media, Viva and Channel 5, while direc tors' blushes over the historical 700p share price target are addressed with a 100p cash-back promise to shareholders. Accompanying this, Time Warner gets an incentive to maximise EMI's share price performance in the form of the right to buy 8% of the British firm if it can keep the stock above 900p, post-100p cash back, for any two weeks in the next three and a half years. Meanwhile, on this side of the Atlantic, EMI's directors have simply promised not to engage in any new business outside Warner EMI Music this side of 2004. Confused? Well, joint-deputy chairman Sir Peter Walters and the other non-executives on the remuneration committee - Sir Dominic Cadbury, Harald Einsmann, Hugh Jenkins and Kathleen O'Donovan - had no problems at all. They have waved the deal through as a straightforward \"change of control\", so everyone at the top of the firm gets to see the shares and options sitting awarded as long-term incentives turned into short-term readies. Mr Nicoli has clearly got his head screwed on, but sadly it is not pointing in the direction of his regular shareholders. Force required Peter Kindersley may soon need to consult one of his own dictionaries to discover when lots of \"one-off\" disasters should more accurately be described as a litany of disaster. The latest warning from his children's book publishing group seems to be one of the worst yet, and has already claimed the scalp of chief executive James Middlehurst. Dorling Kindersley is expecting to lose \u00a325m after having grossly overestimated the number of Star Wars books it was likely to sell in the peak pre-Christmas period. It shifted only 3m out of 13m printed, a result many lay people could have predicted as most cinema-goers have long since moved on to new pastures. Even if this fits Mr Kindersley's definition of \"one-off\", the other horrors lurking in the trading statement do not. The firm, now reliant on generous treatment from its bankers, is badly misjudging its stock control - it has \u00a344m of unsold goods in warehouses - and has taken too long to come to grips with the need to establish a more reliable distribution arrangement in the UK. The group cannot afford, as happened last September, to fail to get its books on to the shelves of an important retailer like WH Smith. Dorling Kindersley should be sitting pretty - it is developing a good multimedia offering, has an amazingly strong brand, a credibly strong presence in the American market and is smack-bang in the middle of one of the most promising media sectors - education. But that franchise is persistently un dermined by management ineptitude. In its record since joining the stock market in 1992, there has been one constant, Peter Kindersley, who leapt straight back into the driving seat yesterday. His strong identification with the company - he founded it and still speaks for nearly a third of the shares - should be an advantage. But it is hard to escape the conclusion that he is part of the problem. He had to be prised out of the role of chairman and chief executive and remains executive chairman. Regardeless of whether the board complies with the rules of corporate governance, it is lacking in heavyweight independents to act as a counterweight to Mr Kindersley. The chances of attracting a new chief executive of calibre can only be aided by a promise to strengthen the board. Either that, or Mr Kindesley's advisers should find a buyer for the firm, before the \u00a31 bookshops are overwhelmed.",

      "body": "<p>There were three reasons why I was reluctant to engage in bashing the National Health Service during the flu epidemic. First, after last year's experiences under the surgeon's knife and six long months in hospital, I owe my life to the NHS. Secondly, I read Lord Winston's interview in the New Statesman, and found what he had to say pompous and reactionary, both on the NHS and on the \"hereditaries\" thrown out of the House of Lords, whom he nostalgically supports. Then, gathering up courage, I fought my way through last week's Commons debate on the health service. The Tories could hardly contain their delight at what they felt was a crisis for the NHS. Too gutless to attack the principle of the NHS head on, as their party did when the NHS was formed, they all put forward \"reforms\" which would weaken or destroy it. </p> <p>A blustering speech came from the former defence secretary, Michael Portillo, who seems to have lost none of his old SAS form. He concentrated on the way the NHS is funded - by general taxation. This was, he boomed, \"a historical accident not replicated by any other country in the world\". Sensible European countries, he revealed, finance their healthcare mainly by other means - by national or private insurance, for instance. Why could not Britain do the same? The same point in different ways was made by Dr Liam Fox, the Tory's health spokesman, and Sir Norman Fowler who spoke exactly as if he is a director of a private health insurance company. (Well, he is in a way. He's a director of Numark, which he described as an industrial provident society with more than 1,300 community pharmacies.) </p> <p>Financing the NHS out of general taxation is not a historical accident. It was the result of a well thought out decision by the Labour government's secretary of state of the time, Aneurin Bevan. The proof is in Bevan's book, In Place of Fear, which was published in 1952, a year after Bevan and other ministers resigned over the imposition of the first prescription charges. Bevan writes that he carefully studied the various proposals for financing the health service. \"Should the health service be on an insurance basis? I decided against this. It had always seemed to me that a personal contributory basis was peculiarly inappropriate to a national health service.\" He then listed the \"endless anomalies\" which would result from any insurance system - \"limited benefits for limited contributions\", for instance, and humiliating, vexatious means-testing of patients who can't afford the premiums. \"The really objectionable feature,\" he concluded, \"is the creation of a two-standard health service, one below and one above the salt. It is merely the old British poor law system over again. The essence of a satisfactory health service is that the rich and the poor are treated alike, that poverty is not a disability and wealth is not advantaged.\" </p> <p>That the British health service, unlike any other in Europe, is paid for out of general taxation is not a historical accident but a socialist idea translated into action. No wonder Portillo &amp; Co hate it so much, and refuse to draw the real lesson from the flu crisis: that the health service is in a mess not because of where its money comes from, but because that money is not enough. </p> <p>I hope that the prime minister and his health secretary hold out for Aneurin Bevan's simple socialist idea against the latest assault on it by the Tories and the health insurance industry. This hope, however, is not encouraged by the enthusiasm with which ministers have endorsed PFI (private finance initiative) schemes for building new hospitals. These schemes have the same flaws and will lead to the same poor law catastrophes that Bevan predicted for an insurance-dominated health service. </p> <p>Nor does there seem to be any limit to the government's craze for privatisation. Last week the name was announced of the head of the new transport super-quango, or task force.

      "bodyText": "There were three reasons why I was reluctant to engage in bashing the National Health Service during the flu epidemic. First, after last year's experiences under the surgeon's knife and six long months in hospital, I owe my life to the NHS. Secondly, I read Lord Winston's interview in the New Statesman, and found what he had to say pompous and reactionary, both on the NHS and on the \"hereditaries\" thrown out of the House of Lords, whom he nostalgically supports. Then, gathering up courage, I fought my way through last week's Commons debate on the health service. The Tories could hardly contain their delight at what they felt was a crisis for the NHS. Too gutless to attack the principle of the NHS head on, as their party did when the NHS was formed, they all put forward \"reforms\" which would weaken or destroy it. A blustering speech came from the former defence secretary, Michael Portillo, who seems to have lost none of his old SAS form. He concentrated on the way the NHS is funded - by general taxation. This was, he boomed, \"a historical accident not replicated by any other country in the world\". Sensible European countries, he revealed, finance their healthcare mainly by other means - by national or private insurance, for instance. Why could not Britain do the same? The same point in different ways was made by Dr Liam Fox, the Tory's health spokesman, and Sir Norman Fowler who spoke exactly as if he is a director of a private health insurance company. (Well, he is in a way. He's a director of Numark, which he described as an industrial provident society with more than 1,300 community pharmacies.) Financing the NHS out of general taxation is not a historical accident. It was the result of a well thought out decision by the Labour government's secretary of state of the time, Aneurin Bevan. The proof is in Bevan's book, In Place of Fear, which was published in 1952, a year after Bevan and other ministers resigned over the imposition of the first prescription charges. Bevan writes that he carefully studied the various proposals for financing the health service. \"Should the health service be on an insurance basis? I decided against this. It had always seemed to me that a personal contributory basis was peculiarly inappropriate to a national health service.\" He then listed the \"endless anomalies\" which would result from any insurance system - \"limited benefits for limited contributions\", for instance, and humiliating, vexatious means-testing of patients who can't afford the premiums. \"The really objectionable feature,\" he concluded, \"is the creation of a two-standard health service, one below and one above the salt. It is merely the old British poor law system over again. The essence of a satisfactory health service is that the rich and the poor are treated alike, that poverty is not a disability and wealth is not advantaged.\" That the British health service, unlike any other in Europe, is paid for out of general taxation is not a historical accident but a socialist idea translated into action. No wonder Portillo &amp; Co hate it so much, and refuse to draw the real lesson from the flu crisis: that the health service is in a mess not because of where its money comes from, but because that money is not enough. I hope that the prime minister and his health secretary hold out for Aneurin Bevan's simple socialist idea against the latest assault on it by the Tories and the health insurance industry. This hope, however, is not encouraged by the enthusiasm with which ministers have endorsed PFI (private finance initiative) schemes for building new hospitals. These schemes have the same flaws and will lead to the same poor law catastrophes that Bevan predicted for an insurance-dominated health service. Nor does there seem to be any limit to the government's craze for privatisation. Last week the name was announced of the head of the new transport super-quango, or task force. He is old Etonian Willy Rickett, described as \"one of the chief architects of electricity privatisation in the late 80s\". As such, no doubt he will be remembered by the opponents of electricity privatisation at the time. Labour's frontbench spokesman on energy, for instance, told the Commons on December 12 1988: \"We are proud that we took this industry [electricity] into public ownership.\" He railed against the \"stupidity, indeed the impossibility, of an energy policy determined by the interests of the private sector\".

Michael yesterday unveiled a white paper with his plan for Wales. The aims include reducing teenage pregnancies so that there are no more than elsewhere in the UK, and increasing non-car journeys to work from a fifth to a quarter. All by 2010. This is just soooooo exciting, I can hardly tell you. But there are some far more general implications.

There remains great goodwill towards Mr Blair. However, when the opportunity comes to teach him a lesson without giving aid and comfort to William Hague, voters take it. The lesson is that devolution means giving away power: if that means letting in Rhodri or Ken, tough luck. Yet the prime minister can't grasp it at all. His infernal bossiness may yet destroy him.</p> <p>\u0095 Matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk</p>",

Last week he gave a lecture at Cardiff University (Western Mail headline: \"We can't go on like this\") in which he advocated a full-scale coalition at the assembly, an option described by one hysterical Labour MP as \"the road to fascism\". A Davies comeback is still improbable, though as he nudges closer to the nationalists, not impossible. The only other visible rival to Michael is Rhodri Morgan, whose stock has fallen in the year since Tony Blair sabotaged his moral victory in the battle to lead Welsh Labour. Being despised by Downing Street is probably a necessary qualification to be a credible leader in Wales, but not a sufficient one. Apart from that there are only people no one has heard of; the option of a Plaid Cymru-Lib Dem coalition, also without a majority; and (most likely of all) a fix, with some semi-bogus cash injection from Gordon Brown that enables Michael to limp on. At the moment life is carrying on as ever. Michael yesterday unveiled a white paper with his plan for Wales. The aims include reducing teenage pregnancies so that there are no more than elsewhere in the UK, and increasing non-car journeys to work from a fifth to a quarter. All by 2010. This is just soooooo exciting, I can hardly tell you. But there are some far more general implications. Next week there is a Westminster byelection in Ceredigion (as in \"I'm cold, I must find my ceredigion\"). Plaid is expected to romp it. Indeed, if things go on the way they are, Labour could lose heaps of seats to them in the next election. We see the same pattern all over Britain. No one, but no one, wants the Tories back. There remains great goodwill towards Mr Blair. However, when the opportunity comes to teach him a lesson without giving aid and comfort to William Hague, voters take it. The lesson is that devolution means giving away power: if that means letting in Rhodri or Ken, tough luck. Yet the prime minister can't grasp it at all. His infernal bossiness may yet destroy him. \u0095 Matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk",

Hardly anyone seems to think that Mr Dyke is, by all previous standards expected of the BBC, damaged goods. </p> <p>In enjoying this privilege, he is an exemplar of a wider cultural shift, alarming in a new way. He is better seen not as an entryist with New Labour allegiances, but as proof that allegiance no longer matters. To matter, allegiance needs to be contested. Somehow, when there is no contest, it no longer seems shocking. Mr Dyke plainly is New Labour: \u00a350,000 is a pledge that can't be talked away, and it certainly wasn't withdrawn when it should have become unbearably embarrassing. But he is exonerated because New Labour is the only game in town, the thing to be, the orthodoxy. So much so that there's no other choice to be made, and therefore nothing wrong with this one. </p> <p>The only proof of Mr Dyke's unsuitability for the BBC might have been giving money to the Tories. This would have backed not only the wrong side but the losing side, thus displaying him as a man of shaky judgment. As it was, he judged right. He supported the winning side, and reckoned that, in the interval, a gesture which would in other times have rendered him ineligible to uphold the perceived values of the BBC had been drained of controversy. For New Labour is the norm. As such it has acquired banality. Detachment and objectivity - in a word, outsiderdom - are not imperilled by it. Allegiance, therefore, requires no apology. It does not matter. Mr Dyke arrives in his job charged with a conflict of interest deriving from his Granada shares but not a breath of a conflict from being a Labour donor. </p> <p>This is a development for which ironic is too weak a word. Hideously paradoxical would be better. The spirit of detachment, jealously guarded in both perception and reality, survived the decades in which allegiance really did matter. During the half-century in which right and left were at each other's throats, the BBC rigorously upheld detachment and was universally respected for doing so. Now that left and right are barely arguing, the tradition that exalted objectivity and resisted every signal of allegiance is treated with indifference verging on contempt. </p> <p>The BBC is not suffering alone. In the same post-war half-century, the civil service was also a haven of detachment. That is what the politicians wanted, valued and preserved. They sometimes got impatient, and there were stories of Harold Wilson or Dick Crossman becoming exasperated with this or that mandarin. But when the central office of information put its name to a release, the facts in it tended to be true. A spirit of disinterested professionalism held the ring between parties that stood for opposite views of the world. </p> <p>Now, when these views are much less easy to distinguish, the civil service tradition has been savagely eroded. The more the zeitgeist expresses consensus, the more partisan these former temples of detachment are expected to become and the less reliable are the rules that once protected their reputation. In place of the COI as a purveyor of facts, we have spin doctors as explainers-away of facts. In place of official truth-tellers, we have party propagandists on the state payroll. In place of a budget statement, once the holiest temple of statistical veracity, we have, even here, bent figures and selective disclosure. </p> <p>This deterioration began with the most ideological of modern prime ministers. It was in the Thatcher era that the left/right divide reached greatest intensity, and the detachment of both BBC and Whitehall came under most severe challenge. But the trend has been much amplified by the supreme leader of post-ideological politics. The era when left has been subsumed into right turns out to be the era when allegiance is most heavily expected, and the disciplines against inappropriate allegiance are withering way.

He is indeed professional. Everyone says he cares about the programmes. He'll offer some escape from the structuralist aridities of Lord Birt. He might even resist appointment to the House of Lords, the final burial ground of any non-establishment instincts Birt might conceivably lay claim to. </p> <p>All the same, the context that allowed the Labour benefactor to rise unresisted, into a job he would once have got nowhere near, is deplorable. The voiding of allegiance may seem seductive. The emergence of a world in which doctrine has become redundant makes for political continuity, which might be expected to bring a certain stability with it. But it seems to have led, in the British case, to an allegiance to Blairism which pretends to be innocuous: to be somehow above commitment, and above the normal rules that try to guarantee public life is neither corrupt nor totalitarian: yet which is, in fact, as parti pris as every other political affiliation. </p> <p>The rules, on the whole, have worked in the past.

His ready acceptance is said to speak for an age that has got things in perspective, no longer fusses about minutiae, gives the job to the right man and accepts that his own allegiance to Blair is as disposable as Blair's to any ideology. Actually it proclaims an era that is forgetting the dangers of one-party government, one-party allegiance, and a one-party state apparatus, all achieved under the illusion that the whole world, bar a few neanderthal conservatives, can be classified as one of us.

      "body": "<p>Why are we still asking whether mothers should work? And why are programme-makers selectively quoting research studies in order to try to prove the totally discredited notion that for mothers to go out to work is bad for their children? </p> <p>Last night's Panorama on BBC television could have shown the real story of the past 10 years. This is that as mothers pour in ever increasing numbers into the workplace, there has been no long-term damage. Children have not disintegrated; women, against massive odds, have managed what seemed not so long ago to be impossible and are (on the whole) more positive about work than their partners are. So why then does programme-maker Sarah Powell find it necessary to pick through the accumulating evidence of this success story looking for evidence of negative effects and telling us, once again, that if we work our lives will be miserable and our children will be damaged? </p> <p>In her last programme, also for Panorama which went out in 1997, Powell \"discovered\" that children with full-time working parents performed less well at school. The research on which that programme was based was a tiny case study of working-class families in a particularly educationally and financially impoverished area of London. Powell illustrated \"the evidence\" with footage of middle-class families with the clear implication that the findings can be generalised. Margaret O'Brien, of the University of North London, did the original research, and is remarkably polite about the way in which her research was used, pointing out that the juxtaposition of words and pictures: \"created different meanings for the audience\". </p> <p>Too right it did. Any working mother not equipped with the research background would have been led to believe that her job was directly, and negatively, affecting her children's life chances. Another prominent academic in the field, approached by the same production team, told me: \"I will not have anything to do with that woman.\" </p> <p>So what is the evidence of educational failure that last night's programme headlines? Well, according to Heather Joshi, researcher at the Institute of Education on which much of this week's programme was based, there is no effect from the mother's employment on future job prospects; there is no effect on teenage pregnancy. Yes, there is a slight effect on the level of qualifications of older children, but that effect is cancelled out by the overwhelming issue of class and the mother's educational attainment. What this actually means in practice is, as Joshi says: \"It's a trade off. You either have more material resources or a mother at home. The effect on the children will be the same.\" In other words, it is only if you can coerce your partner into earning enough to offset your share of the family income that your presence by the hearth will actually have a positive effect on your infant's future. </p> <p>More important to my mind is a factor which the programme-makers chose to ignore. The very same research they have been trumpeting so loudly also found that children whose mothers went out to work when they were under the age of five are \"less anxious and significantly better adjusted\" than their peers and, where the \"qualifications\" effect is highly sensitive to class and educational background, this effect is not. </p> <p>How do we explain this? Could it be that the anxious and maladjusted children of the overbearing stay-at-home mothers are so keen to succeed that they go on clocking up qualifications to bolster their flagging self-esteem - leaving their better adjusted peers to pick up the jobs? Now that would be a new angle. Perhaps Sarah Powell should go for it? I rather doubt that she will. </p> <p>Last night's programme, far from adding to a debate on the future of work and families, has dragged it back years. That sonorous voice introducing it with the words: \"Many mothers are finding it harder and harder to balance work with children.\" Dong! \"Research shows that young children may lose out if both parents work.\" Dong! Cue miserable, exhausted women with slightly bemused and pissed-off partners who seemed to think it unfair that they should be expected to bear their share of the stress of early parenthood. But then parenthood is by nature stressful. Why do we expect it to be otherwise? It is the central job of humanity to care for its young so why do we expect it to be a recreational activity, somewhat akin to gardening? The problem is not that parenthood is hard work but that the rest of society believes that individual mothers (not fathers, let alone employers or government) should bear the entire responsibility. </p> <p>A new thought? Not really. I wrote this on the same subject in 1983: \"It was having a baby which... brought home to me with real force the hopelessly unbalanced nature of a society which is organised solely for the needs of people without responsibility for children.\" Plus \u00e7a change. </p> <p>In Powell's programme, \"society\" was represented by Ruth Lea, of the Institute of Directors, who intoned that if a woman wanted a man's job, she should be prepared to work like a man. Who says so? Why isn't it equally acceptable to say that if a man wants to be a parent he should parent like a woman? Or that those who have not contributed to the upbringing of children should be barred from reaping the rewards of their labour in years to come? Life would indeed be tough if we all gave up having children. </p> <p>The overwhelming story which Panorama barely touched on is the degree to which the workplace revolution of the past 10 years has taken place in spite of, rather than because of, legislative change which has been at best grudging and at worst positively obstructive. When the last government introduced a maternity leave of just 14 weeks, forcing many women to return to work or lose their jobs, many campaigners thought that the law had actually been designed to fail. They were expecting a huge drop-out rate from mothers who returned to work too early. Now the first research studies are beginning to show that drop out. </p> <p>According to Susan Harkness, the social scientist who contributed to last night's programme, those mothers least likely to drop out had high job satisfaction and partners who helped out with childcare. Those most likely to drop out were the mothers who went back earliest and for the longest hours. Interesting stuff except that this programme chooses to show the results as a by-product of motherhood rather than the effect of lousy legislation and lack of support. </p> <p>It is surely the inhumanity of current employment law and the reluctance of even this family-loving government, to address the real, practical needs of working parents, that is the real issue here - not the ability of a mother to hold down a job. And if there is a scandal to uncover it is the passivity of those campaigning organisations which, instead of putting pressure on the government for change, seem to have collectively rolled over and allowed Tony to tickle their tummies with new year honours and promises of large grants. We still have lousy maternity leave, our parental leave is unpaid, we have the most expensive childcare in Europe and we are still plagued with programme-makers who tell us to feel guilty. We have no reason for guilt, only for anger. </p> <p>\u0095 Angela Phillips is an author, lecturer and parent</p>",

In her last programme, also for Panorama which went out in 1997, Powell \"discovered\" that children with full-time working parents performed less well at school. The research on which that programme was based was a tiny case study of working-class families in a particularly educationally and financially impoverished area of London. Powell illustrated \"the evidence\" with footage of middle-class families with the clear implication that the findings can be generalised. Margaret O'Brien, of the University of North London, did the original research, and is remarkably polite about the way in which her research was used, pointing out that the juxtaposition of words and pictures: \"created different meanings for the audience\". Too right it did. Any working mother not equipped with the research background would have been led to believe that her job was directly, and negatively, affecting her children's life chances. Another prominent academic in the field, approached by the same production team, told me: \"I will not have anything to do with that woman.\" So what is the evidence of educational failure that last night's programme headlines? Well, according to Heather Joshi, researcher at the Institute of Education on which much of this week's programme was based, there is no effect from the mother's employment on future job prospects; there is no effect on teenage pregnancy. Yes, there is a slight effect on the level of qualifications of older children, but that effect is cancelled out by the overwhelming issue of class and the mother's educational attainment. What this actually means in practice is, as Joshi says: \"It's a trade off. You either have more material resources or a mother at home. The effect on the children will be the same.\" In other words, it is only if you can coerce your partner into earning enough to offset your share of the family income that your presence by the hearth will actually have a positive effect on your infant's future. More important to my mind is a factor which the programme-makers chose to ignore. The very same research they have been trumpeting so loudly also found that children whose mothers went out to work when they were under the age of five are \"less anxious and significantly better adjusted\" than their peers and, where the \"qualifications\" effect is highly sensitive to class and educational background, this effect is not. How do we explain this? Could it be that the anxious and maladjusted children of the overbearing stay-at-home mothers are so keen to succeed that they go on clocking up qualifications to bolster their flagging self-esteem - leaving their better adjusted peers to pick up the jobs? Now that would be a new angle. Perhaps Sarah Powell should go for it? I rather doubt that she will. Last night's programme, far from adding to a debate on the future of work and families, has dragged it back years. That sonorous voice introducing it with the words: \"Many mothers are finding it harder and harder to balance work with children.\" Dong! \"Research shows that young children may lose out if both parents work.\" Dong! Cue miserable, exhausted women with slightly bemused and pissed-off partners who seemed to think it unfair that they should be expected to bear their share of the stress of early parenthood. But then parenthood is by nature stressful. Why do we expect it to be otherwise? It is the central job of humanity to care for its young so why do we expect it to be a recreational activity, somewhat akin to gardening? The problem is not that parenthood is hard work but that the rest of society believes that individual mothers (not fathers, let alone employers or government) should bear the entire responsibility. A new thought? Not really. I wrote this on the same subject in 1983: \"It was having a baby which... brought home to me with real force the hopelessly unbalanced nature of a society which is organised solely for the needs of people without responsibility for children.\" Plus \u00e7a change. In Powell's programme, \"society\" was represented by Ruth Lea, of the Institute of Directors, who intoned that if a woman wanted a man's job, she should be prepared to work like a man. Who says so? Why isn't it equally acceptable to say that if a man wants to be a parent he should parent like a woman? Or that those who have not contributed to the upbringing of children should be barred from reaping the rewards of their labour in years to come? Life would indeed be tough if we all gave up having children. The overwhelming story which Panorama barely touched on is the degree to which the workplace revolution of the past 10 years has taken place in spite of, rather than because of, legislative change which has been at best grudging and at worst positively obstructive. When the last government introduced a maternity leave of just 14 weeks, forcing many women to return to work or lose their jobs, many campaigners thought that the law had actually been designed to fail. They were expecting a huge drop-out rate from mothers who returned to work too early. Now the first research studies are beginning to show that drop out. According to Susan Harkness, the social scientist who contributed to last night's programme, those mothers least likely to drop out had high job satisfaction and partners who helped out with childcare. Those most likely to drop out were the mothers who went back earliest and for the longest hours. Interesting stuff except that this programme chooses to show the results as a by-product of motherhood rather than the effect of lousy legislation and lack of support. It is surely the inhumanity of current employment law and the reluctance of even this family-loving government, to address the real, practical needs of working parents, that is the real issue here - not the ability of a mother to hold down a job. And if there is a scandal to uncover it is the passivity of those campaigning organisations which, instead of putting pressure on the government for change, seem to have collectively rolled over and allowed Tony to tickle their tummies with new year honours and promises of large grants. We still have lousy maternity leave, our parental leave is unpaid, we have the most expensive childcare in Europe and we are still plagued with programme-makers who tell us to feel guilty. We have no reason for guilt, only for anger. \u0095 Angela Phillips is an author, lecturer and parent",

      "body": "<p>Until recently, one could have been forgiven for thinking that the only women who mattered in the race for London mayor have been, variously, fragrant wives, adoring mistresses and disgraced call girls. But yesterday a woman candidate finally made the big time, in headline terms at least, when Ken Livingstone offered Glenda Jackson a key role in any future administration, including chair of the new police authority and the role of roving ambassador for the capital.</p> <p>Livingstone may have spoken of Jackson in sentimental terms, honouring \"the widespread affection and respect\" she commands from Londoners, her \"honesty and forthrightness\". But Livingstone is an acute political tactician. His offer is no last-minute attempt to play the feminist card, but belated acknowledgment of a surprisingly successful political campaign which has finally transformed the actress-turned-MP into a serious political player.</p> <p>This new potency and her deepening public popularity was very much in evidence on the Jackson campaign trail last week. Visiting a gallery at the Sternberg Centre in north London featuring new paintings on the Holocaust, one can see how the public, as opposed to fellow MPs and the lobby, see her. A small slim woman, neat rather than glamorous in a red coat and well-styled reddish hair, Jackson brings out both deference and protectiveness from the men and women present. I understand why her personal political heroine is Mary Robinson, ex-president of Ireland; Jackson has the same mix of seriousness and charm. When she tells a story about herself as a child, witnessing the \"absolute frozen shock\" of the adults who had just watched the first footage from Belsen, there is complete silence. And a little later she makes them laugh, with a story about her Oscar statuettes ending up in a cardboard box.</p> <p>No one calls her Glenda - but she is not Ms Jackson either. She is a hybrid figure: Glenda Jackson, national cultural monument, politician of principle and a frail, formidable woman of sixtysomething whom you want to wrap your arms around, ask advice of, then give her a little of your own. Perhaps it is something to do with her recent revelations that she was beaten up in not one but two previous relationships. But Jackson now has only one thing on her mind: winning the Labour nomination to be London's first elected mayor.</p> <p>She won't win; the maths doesn't add up. But she has scored consistently higher ratings than the official frontrunner, Frank Dobson, in the opinion polls. She has resisted both the pressure and indifference of new Labour headquarters, and she was righteously incandescent at suggestions made in a Panorama programme that Dobson was given privileged access to London membership lists. Her new semi-detached status from the leadership has freed her to criticise the government on issues such as the Pinochet affair, which has only increased her popularity.</p> <p>In short, Jackson has turned her one obvious disadvantage as a candidate - her remove from the titanic ideological struggle currently being waged at the heart of Labour - into a positive feature of her campaign. Jackson has been doing that old-fashioned thing: getting out and about. One London Labour MP, a Dobson supporter, invited all three candidates to talk to his local party. \"Glenda Jackson was the outstanding candidate. She was engaged, thoughtful and answered people's questions in surprising ways.\"</p> <p>She is certainly in skilful form at one of the final campaign debates with Trevor Phillips, Dobson's urbane deputy. Her set speech is brisk and seamless, but in the discussion she comes alive. It is standard new Labour stuff - defence of the public/private partnership plans for the tube, contemptuous rejection of any arguments for greater redistribution - but she brings to it an intellectual precision and a fury that most reminds me of Blair when he is riled. How much does she want to be London's mayor? \"Oh, I want it,\" she laughs. \"I really, really, really want the job.\" And, no, she won't consider any offers from other candidates until she knows she hasn't got it.</p> <p>She first thought of standing when, as a junior minister in Prescott's department, she and Nick Raynsford (another mayoral hopeful whose candidacy lasted a matter of weeks) piloted the original bill through the House. \"I've always resented the idea that all new and important jobs are the preserve of men.\"</p> <p>Jackson is a Labour loyalist - even now she speaks of Margaret Thatcher with biting contempt - but she talks of the mayoralty in almost apolitical terms. \"All the truly successful mayors, whatever their political base, have to speak for and on behalf of that city.\" Her personal manifesto is a thoughtful 15-page document full of special teams and squads to fight everything from crime, drugs and skills shortages to London's multiple transport failures.</p> <p>She is better on people than policy. \"London is a city which has been good to me. All the main experiences of my life have happened here. I've been poor in London. I've been well off in London. It's a great city with great problems.\" When she visited Barcelona, she loved the fact that \"everyone knew the mayor as we walked through the streets\". It's easy to imagine: Glenda in the streets and squares of Bromley, Harrow, Brixton and Hackney, drinking in all the complaints, all the suggestions, all the stories. And, as Livingstone recognises, she has a cultural cachet which would fit her exactly for the role of \"roving ambassador\". A bit of make-up, her favourite Jean Muir suit, that stroppy, sexy voice. Fellow Europeans would adore her.</p> <p>Yet one wonders why it has taken her so long to make her own distinctive political mark. When first elected to parliament in 1992, there was an explicit pressure on the Oscar-winning actress to become our own version of Melina Mercouri or Jane Fonda, a gravelly-voiced temptress turned passionate political campaigner. Instead Jackson appeared a dutiful, slightly droney moderniser and then a competent but unexciting minister at Prescott's department of transport. Throughout the 90s the media has insistently dissected its disappointment in the ex-actress. Why is she so much more interesting when she stops talking politics? Why does she leave her pale, brutally beautiful face so often unpainted? But beneath the rote complaints lay a deeper truth. Something was missing in Jackson's political personality. It was not merely charm, as some MPs and lobby correspondents have claimed, the fact that \"she simply walks around parliament clutching a pad of A4 papers to her chest\", according to one political journalist. She was clearly sincere, undoubtedly hardworking, but a spark was missing.</p> <p>Perhaps it was her total loyalty to the leadership, which inevitably dulls a true political voice, or a lack of confidence that no one had the imagination to see in a film star. Maybe it was that old British affliction: class. Jackson started her working life stacking shelves in Boots. It might take a few years to get used to the staggering arrogance of some Westminster men (and not a few women).</p> <p>But fighting for London and for herself has liberated new political gifts in her. There is certainly no brusqueness when she is meeting the people. She is modest, amusing and engaged. At the Sternberg Centre, somebody tentatively asks her about the difference between acting and politics. Quick as a flash, she answers: \"Both are about stripping things away. In their different ways, each are about trying to get to the truth.\"</p> <p>\"You will come back, won't you,\" someone calls out as she leaves. \"I certainly will,\" she says with that Jackson grimace, a parody of determination. Both question and answer are surely metaphors for Jackson's future, which looks surprisingly bright. Even if she loses this time there will be another campaign for mayor in four years' time. And she will still be a tough, talented woman with a lot more experience and with yet more protective layers stripped away: a more truthful politician.</p>",

Livingstone may have spoken of Jackson in sentimental terms, honouring \"the widespread affection and respect\" she commands from Londoners, her \"honesty and forthrightness\". But Livingstone is an acute political tactician. His offer is no last-minute attempt to play the feminist card, but belated acknowledgment of a surprisingly successful political campaign which has finally transformed the actress-turned-MP into a serious political player. This new potency and her deepening public popularity was very much in evidence on the Jackson campaign trail last week. Visiting a gallery at the Sternberg Centre in north London featuring new paintings on the Holocaust, one can see how the public, as opposed to fellow MPs and the lobby, see her. A small slim woman, neat rather than glamorous in a red coat and well-styled reddish hair, Jackson brings out both deference and protectiveness from the men and women present. I understand why her personal political heroine is Mary Robinson, ex-president of Ireland; Jackson has the same mix of seriousness and charm. When she tells a story about herself as a child, witnessing the \"absolute frozen shock\" of the adults who had just watched the first footage from Belsen, there is complete silence. And a little later she makes them laugh, with a story about her Oscar statuettes ending up in a cardboard box. No one calls her Glenda - but she is not Ms Jackson either. She is a hybrid figure: Glenda Jackson, national cultural monument, politician of principle and a frail, formidable woman of sixtysomething whom you want to wrap your arms around, ask advice of, then give her a little of your own. Perhaps it is something to do with her recent revelations that she was beaten up in not one but two previous relationships. But Jackson now has only one thing on her mind: winning the Labour nomination to be London's first elected mayor. She won't win; the maths doesn't add up. But she has scored consistently higher ratings than the official frontrunner, Frank Dobson, in the opinion polls. She has resisted both the pressure and indifference of new Labour headquarters, and she was righteously incandescent at suggestions made in a Panorama programme that Dobson was given privileged access to London membership lists. Her new semi-detached status from the leadership has freed her to criticise the government on issues such as the Pinochet affair, which has only increased her popularity. In short, Jackson has turned her one obvious disadvantage as a candidate - her remove from the titanic ideological struggle currently being waged at the heart of Labour - into a positive feature of her campaign. Jackson has been doing that old-fashioned thing: getting out and about. One London Labour MP, a Dobson supporter, invited all three candidates to talk to his local party. \"Glenda Jackson was the outstanding candidate. She was engaged, thoughtful and answered people's questions in surprising ways.\" She is certainly in skilful form at one of the final campaign debates with Trevor Phillips, Dobson's urbane deputy. Her set speech is brisk and seamless, but in the discussion she comes alive. It is standard new Labour stuff - defence of the public/private partnership plans for the tube, contemptuous rejection of any arguments for greater redistribution - but she brings to it an intellectual precision and a fury that most reminds me of Blair when he is riled. How much does she want to be London's mayor? \"Oh, I want it,\" she laughs. \"I really, really, really want the job.\" And, no, she won't consider any offers from other candidates until she knows she hasn't got it. She first thought of standing when, as a junior minister in Prescott's department, she and Nick Raynsford (another mayoral hopeful whose candidacy lasted a matter of weeks) piloted the original bill through the House. \"I've always resented the idea that all new and important jobs are the preserve of men.\" Jackson is a Labour loyalist - even now she speaks of Margaret Thatcher with biting contempt - but she talks of the mayoralty in almost apolitical terms. \"All the truly successful mayors, whatever their political base, have to speak for and on behalf of that city.\" Her personal manifesto is a thoughtful 15-page document full of special teams and squads to fight everything from crime, drugs and skills shortages to London's multiple transport failures. She is better on people than policy. \"London is a city which has been good to me. All the main experiences of my life have happened here. I've been poor in London. I've been well off in London. It's a great city with great problems.\" When she visited Barcelona, she loved the fact that \"everyone knew the mayor as we walked through the streets\". It's easy to imagine: Glenda in the streets and squares of Bromley, Harrow, Brixton and Hackney, drinking in all the complaints, all the suggestions, all the stories. And, as Livingstone recognises, she has a cultural cachet which would fit her exactly for the role of \"roving ambassador\". A bit of make-up, her favourite Jean Muir suit, that stroppy, sexy voice. Fellow Europeans would adore her. Yet one wonders why it has taken her so long to make her own distinctive political mark. When first elected to parliament in 1992, there was an explicit pressure on the Oscar-winning actress to become our own version of Melina Mercouri or Jane Fonda, a gravelly-voiced temptress turned passionate political campaigner. Instead Jackson appeared a dutiful, slightly droney moderniser and then a competent but unexciting minister at Prescott's department of transport. Throughout the 90s the media has insistently dissected its disappointment in the ex-actress. Why is she so much more interesting when she stops talking politics? Why does she leave her pale, brutally beautiful face so often unpainted? But beneath the rote complaints lay a deeper truth. Something was missing in Jackson's political personality. It was not merely charm, as some MPs and lobby correspondents have claimed, the fact that \"she simply walks around parliament clutching a pad of A4 papers to her chest\", according to one political journalist. She was clearly sincere, undoubtedly hardworking, but a spark was missing. Perhaps it was her total loyalty to the leadership, which inevitably dulls a true political voice, or a lack of confidence that no one had the imagination to see in a film star. Maybe it was that old British affliction: class. Jackson started her working life stacking shelves in Boots. It might take a few years to get used to the staggering arrogance of some Westminster men (and not a few women). But fighting for London and for herself has liberated new political gifts in her. There is certainly no brusqueness when she is meeting the people. She is modest, amusing and engaged. At the Sternberg Centre, somebody tentatively asks her about the difference between acting and politics. Quick as a flash, she answers: \"Both are about stripping things away. In their different ways, each are about trying to get to the truth.\" \"You will come back, won't you,\" someone calls out as she leaves. \"I certainly will,\" she says with that Jackson grimace, a parody of determination. Both question and answer are surely metaphors for Jackson's future, which looks surprisingly bright. Even if she loses this time there will be another campaign for mayor in four years' time. And she will still be a tough, talented woman with a lot more experience and with yet more protective layers stripped away: a more truthful politician.",

      "bodyText": "Detectives hunting a serial rapist who has struck at least 11 times over the past nine years yesterday linked the knifepoint attacks for the first time. Following a review of unsolved cases police in Avon and Somerset said it had intensified its investigation, called Operation Eagle, and warned there was a strong possibility of another assault. Two of the women attacked will speak about their ordeal tonight on the BBC programme Crimewatch UK, and Detective Superintendent Bill Davies, who is leading the inquiry, will appeal for other victims who have not reported incidents to come forward. As far as the police can tell, the rapist first struck on May 21 1991, when a 36-year-old woman was abducted at knifepoint as she tried to park her car in Coronation Avenue, Bath. She was forced to drive to a quiet lane where she was attacked. Five months later an 18-year-old was grabbed by a man as she walked up Bathwick Hill in Bath. She was marched to a field where she was subjected to a serious sexual assault. There was a three-year gap before the next attack, and then a further two years of apparent inactivity. Three women were attacked in 1996 and three more in 1997. The last assault was on Tuesday January 26 1999. On that occasion a man attempted to abduct a 39-year-old woman in Forrester Lane, Bathwick, Bath, but was scared off when she screamed for help. As he ran away he dropped a faded grey baseball cap with a green \"Batman Forever\" logo embossed on the front. Within 10 minutes he had abducted another woman in a nearby road. He forced her to drive to the village of Monkton Combe just off the A36 where he assaulted her. Only one of the attacks happened outside Bath - a 19-year-old woman was abducted from Kingswood, Bristol, and raped in September 1996. Police suspect there have been other attacks, particularly in the long periods when the rapist seems to have been inactive, and want to hear from women who may not have reported their experiences before. \"Another possibility to explain the long gaps is that this is a man who comes to the area infrequently, possibly for work reasons,\" said Inspector Keith Jones, a spokesman for Avon and Somerset police. \"We need to talk to anyone who might be able to explain why he has operated in this way.\" Mr Jones said there were similarities in the descriptions provided by victims, and detectives are hoping that recent scientific breakthroughs will make a DNA profile possible.

Hundreds of pupils at Cwmcarn high school near Newport, south Wales, have been kept off school since last week. Under national guidelines mass vaccinations do not normally take place unless two or more cases of the same strain of meningitis are reported within a certain period. Following the death of Ashley Burnett, 14, from the C strain of the illness early last week, close family and contacts were offered jabs. But Cwmcarn parents have been insisting that all children at the 680 pupil school be vaccinated. Pupils aged 15 to 17 were vaccinated last autumn as part of the nationwide immunisation programme aimed at protecting high risk groups. More than a third of the school was absent again yesterday as Gwent health authority and national assembly health officials held a crisis meeting. The decision to extend the vaccination programme to younger pupils came as it emerged that a seven-month- old baby had been admitted to hospital with meningococcal septicaemia in what could be a related case. Although it has not yet been established what strain of meningitis the baby is suffering from, it is understood that a friend of Ashley recently babysat for the family. Don Touhig, MP for Islwyn, said the health authority's decision was a victory for common sense. \"Parents will be pleased we have got a positive reponse,\" he said last night before a public meeting at Cwmcarn rugby club to explain the outcome of negotiations. The vaccination programme is to begin on Thursday, the day after Ashley's funeral. Cwmcarn's headteacher, Bill Beales, said 450 of the school's pupils failed to turn up for lessons on Friday and almost 300 were still absent yesterday. He said a public meeting called by the health authority last week following Ashley's death had failed to allay fears and had led to some parents fighting their corner more vehemently. \"The tragic loss of any child is bound to trigger off highly charged emotional feelings,\" he said. \"Things have calmed down a bit now, but there is a strong and vocal parental group that won't be satisfied unless they have their children vaccinated\". Gwent health authority insisted that the proposed immunisation against meningitis C was not an emergency vaccination but a rescheduling of a programme under which 11- to 14-year-olds were due to be vaccinated in the spring. Eddie Coyle, the authority's director of public health, said that as Ashley's death was an isolated case there was no requirement for emergency public health measures within the school. But he said the authority had agreed to consider the feasibility of bringing forward the vaccination programme in the light of the \"considerable anxiety\" of parents. He said the fact that the children were due to be vaccinated in due course and that it had proved feasible to reschedule the programme were important factors in the decision.",

      "body": "<p>A survey by a dance and club culture magazine has given an insight into the degree of drug-taking and dealing among young people.</p> <p>Seven out of 10 who responded to a questionnaire in Mixmag magazine said they had sold ecstasy, risking a jail sentence of up to four years, and six out of 10 admitted having driven a car after taking it.</p> <p>Eight out of 10 respondents said they regularly took combinations of drugs - ecstasy, amphetamine, cocaine, LSD, amyl nitrate and cannabis; such cocktails carry both mental and physical risks.</p> <p>Adam Winstock, of the national addiction centre at King's College, London, who compiled and analysed the survey, said he had been surprised by how many young people were using ecstasy regularly over a long period.</p> <p>\"Ecstasy is not a fad drug. People have been taking it for five, six or seven years - something you might consider chronic use.\"</p> <p>The survey found that ecstasy was the most common drug among clubbers - taken by 86% of the 1,100 who took part, compared with 73% for cannabis, 46% for cocaine, and 39% for amphetamine.</p> <p>On average males had taken ecstasy 180 times and females 120, with more than half taking at least five pills a night.</p> <p>Four out of 10 young women said they had used amphetamines to control their weight.</p> <p>The survey found women started ecstasy at age 19 on average, compared with 20 for men. A tablet cost between \u00a32 and \u00a325, with an average of \u00a36.89.

      "bodyText": "A survey by a dance and club culture magazine has given an insight into the degree of drug-taking and dealing among young people. Seven out of 10 who responded to a questionnaire in Mixmag magazine said they had sold ecstasy, risking a jail sentence of up to four years, and six out of 10 admitted having driven a car after taking it. Eight out of 10 respondents said they regularly took combinations of drugs - ecstasy, amphetamine, cocaine, LSD, amyl nitrate and cannabis; such cocktails carry both mental and physical risks. Adam Winstock, of the national addiction centre at King's College, London, who compiled and analysed the survey, said he had been surprised by how many young people were using ecstasy regularly over a long period. \"Ecstasy is not a fad drug. People have been taking it for five, six or seven years - something you might consider chronic use.\" The survey found that ecstasy was the most common drug among clubbers - taken by 86% of the 1,100 who took part, compared with 73% for cannabis, 46% for cocaine, and 39% for amphetamine. On average males had taken ecstasy 180 times and females 120, with more than half taking at least five pills a night. Four out of 10 young women said they had used amphetamines to control their weight. The survey found women started ecstasy at age 19 on average, compared with 20 for men. A tablet cost between \u00a32 and \u00a325, with an average of \u00a36.89. One clubber from the south coast said he had taken an ecstasy tablet every day for four years, and had used up to 30 in one weekend. Dr Winstock said 5% of the clubbers who responded were \"heavy chronic binge users\" taking 15 ecstasy pills in one night. Nearly 80% of clubbers combined ecstasy with amphetamines, 55% with cocaine, 49% with amyl nitrate, 29% with LSD; others had used ketamine, Prozac, crack cocaine, and Viagra to create a new high while on ecstasy. More than 17% said they had used benzodiazepines such as Valium to come down from an ecstasy high. \"Valium on the black market is a drug you normally associate with opiate use, so the fact that it has moved into the club scene is worrying,\" said Dr Winstock. Mixmag's editor Tom Whitwell said: \"The really extreme use was quite shocking. And a lot of people are still taking a surprising number of risks, such as driving on drugs and mixing them. \"But the survey also showed that people are taking on board the safety messages, like drinking lots of water and taking vitamin C.\"",

      "bodyText": "Pasteurised milk infected with dangerous bacteria is responsible for a \"public health disaster\", a leading medical specialist warned last night. John Hermon-Taylor, head of the surgical department at St George's medical school in Tooting, south London, claimed that a bacterium believed to cause Crohn's disease, the inflammatory bowel disorder, was not killed by pasteurisation. The bacterium, mycobac terium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (or MAP), was thought to be destroyed by pasteurisation, but Professor Hermon-Taylor claimed that his 20 years of research had proved that Crohn's disease in humans was linked with Johne's disease in cattle and passed on in pasteurised milk. He called on the government to take urgent action to prevent the spread of the disease through unsafe milk. In pasteurisation milk and other foods are heated to destroy disease-causing micro-organisms and protect against putrefaction. A ministry of agriculture spokesman said: \"The government is carrying out its own research, and the advice from the department of health is that, on the basis of what is currently known, there is no need for anyone to change their dietary habits.\" A National Dairy Council spokeswoman said: \"The dairy industry has already taken voluntary steps to increase the pasteurisation time, purely as a precautionary measure. This is only one of a series of hypotheses, and what is needed is further research.\" Crohn's disease, which afflicts about 80,000 people in the UK, is a severe inflammation of the small intestine and the colon, sometimes requiring surgery. Symptoms include chronic diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weight loss, extreme tiredness and psychological problems, and it can produce ulcers and tumours in the bowel. Government scientists researching a possible link between milk and Crohn's disease are due to report this year. However, at present medical specialists assess the risk of infection from drinking a glass of pasteurised milk at one in 5m. Prof Hermon-Taylor, who is funded by the charity Action Research, said: \"The problems caused by MAP in the milk supply constitute a public health disaster of tragic proportions, for which a range of remedial measures are urgently needed, and for which the government must take responsibility. \"I am certain that MAP causes a substantial proportion of Crohn's disease.\" Addressing the Royal Society of Medicine last night, he called for an immediate ban on the sale of unpasteurised milk and greater stringency in the pasteurisation process, including doubling sterilising time from 15 to 30 seconds. He wanted the disease to be made notifiable, requiring doctors to report cases to the department of health, and for wide-ranging testing for MAP in dairy herds and the water supply. \"I'm not scaremongering, but this disease ruins people's lives,\" he said. \"We need as a matter of urgency to carry out research to determine whether MAP is being conveyed from animals to the human population in water supplies.\" Crohn's disease is not fatal. It is estimated there are between 4,000 and 8,000 new cases a year, costing as much as \u00a3240m a year in health care. It has become five times more common in people aged under 26 in the past 20 years, and Anne Luther, director general of Action Research, described the problem in the UK as far greater than either the BSE-linked Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or Aids. Calls for a ban on unpasteurised milk - the raw cow's milk known as \"green top\" favoured by 100,000 consumers, including the Queen - were rejected by the government last January. \u0095 Research by Japanese scientists published today suggests that fears of a link between Crohn's disease and the measles vaccine were unfounded.",

      "body": "<p>The Church of England's ruling body, the general synod, will today receive a report which is likely to pave the way for the church to allow divorcees with ex-partners still alive to remarry with a full church wedding.</p> <p>The proposals before the synod are based on the recommendations of a working party report, Marriage in Church after Divorce. The implications of the legislation could have far reaching effects.</p> <p>While the report does not refer directly to the Prince of Wales, it is believed his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles did influence some decisons. If the legislation were implemented it is possible that the future monarch would be able to remarry in a full church ceremony, even though Mrs Parker Bowles's former husband, Andrew, is still alive.</p> <p>The report, by a working party headed by the Bishop of Winchester, will not propose that the church allow remarriage on demand, but that, given certain circumstances, it should be allowed.</p> <p>The Bishop of Winchester, writing in today's Times, said the changes were imminent and that the report recommended allowing parish priests the discretion to agree to perform marriage services for divorcees whose former partners were still living.</p> <p>The recommendations are seen as an attempt to regulate the church's policy to remarriage as many anglican priests already remarry divorcees with living former partners.</p> <p>In the foreword to the report, the bishop, Michael Scott-Joynt, makes it clear the church's preferred view is that marriage should be a lifelong institution. He said: \"We recognise the sincerely held views of those who take an indissolubist line, but propose nothing that alters the church's traditionalist teaching that marriage should always be undertaken as a life-long commitment, nor do we propose any alteration to the existing statutory protection of clerical consciences on this matter.</p> <p>\"We do nevertheless recommend, unanimously, a straightforward procedure whereby clergy may, by way of exception, solemnise further marriages of divorced persons, with a former partner still living, where circumstances meet the appropriate pastoral criteria, in such a way that this is no longer inconsistent with the declared mind of the church.\"</p> <p>Under the proposals, guidelines for remarriage would be drawn up to ensure a consistent policy on the issue nationwide.

      "bodyText": "The Church of England's ruling body, the general synod, will today receive a report which is likely to pave the way for the church to allow divorcees with ex-partners still alive to remarry with a full church wedding. The proposals before the synod are based on the recommendations of a working party report, Marriage in Church after Divorce. The implications of the legislation could have far reaching effects. While the report does not refer directly to the Prince of Wales, it is believed his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles did influence some decisons. If the legislation were implemented it is possible that the future monarch would be able to remarry in a full church ceremony, even though Mrs Parker Bowles's former husband, Andrew, is still alive. The report, by a working party headed by the Bishop of Winchester, will not propose that the church allow remarriage on demand, but that, given certain circumstances, it should be allowed. The Bishop of Winchester, writing in today's Times, said the changes were imminent and that the report recommended allowing parish priests the discretion to agree to perform marriage services for divorcees whose former partners were still living. The recommendations are seen as an attempt to regulate the church's policy to remarriage as many anglican priests already remarry divorcees with living former partners. In the foreword to the report, the bishop, Michael Scott-Joynt, makes it clear the church's preferred view is that marriage should be a lifelong institution. He said: \"We recognise the sincerely held views of those who take an indissolubist line, but propose nothing that alters the church's traditionalist teaching that marriage should always be undertaken as a life-long commitment, nor do we propose any alteration to the existing statutory protection of clerical consciences on this matter. \"We do nevertheless recommend, unanimously, a straightforward procedure whereby clergy may, by way of exception, solemnise further marriages of divorced persons, with a former partner still living, where circumstances meet the appropriate pastoral criteria, in such a way that this is no longer inconsistent with the declared mind of the church.\" Under the proposals, guidelines for remarriage would be drawn up to ensure a consistent policy on the issue nationwide. The couple seeking to be remarried would discuss with the clergy reasons for the previous breakdown, how the remarriage would affect children from the previous marriage and whether the new relationship had ended the old. Parish priests would also consider how many times either partner had been married, and would refer each case to the diocesan bishop before agreeing to permit the marriage to take place in church. The final decision would rest with the parish priest, although priests would not be forced to carry out marriages if they believed it to be wrong. The report recommends that the option of a service of prayer and dedication after a civil marriage service should remain at the discretion of the priest. Diocesan synods will consider the recommendations, reporting back to the House of Bishops by March 2001, with a view to discussions in the general synod by the end of that year.",

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday mounted a rearguard action to prevent a \"silent majority\" backlash over gay sex education sweeping south from Scotland into middle England as ministers moved towards repealing the Thatcherite legislation at the root of the controversy. English bishops and the Conservative opposition weighed in behind the Catholic hierarchy in Scotland to oppose repeal of section 28, which forbids councils from promoting homosexuality. But Tony Blair appealed for a \"rational and sensible\" debate on the issue and Downing Street insisted that the controversial 1988 clause had never applied directly to schools in England and Wales, although officials admitted that many teachers believe it does. Labour is desperate to head off another public kicking on a populist controversy which could find the cabinet on the unpopular side. Most of the cabinet is solidly behind repeal but the government is treading a tightrope and anxious not to pick new enemies. Local government ministers Lord Whitty and Beverley Hughes were sent on a round of television and radio interviews to promise \"family-values-oriented guidance\" to schools and local authorities. Repeal of section 28 would free teachers and council workers from the fear of \"stepping over the line\" of the current law, Ms Hughes suggested. \"The guidance in relation to sex education in particular will stress the importance of the context of family values and what children need to grow up, but it will also enable teachers to deal with the real issues that gay and lesbian pupils bring into school and want schools and teachers to help them with,\" she said. With the issue bitterly dividing Scotland, the local government bill which would repeal the clause moves to the Lords today. It is likely to face defeat by a cross-party coalition within the next week. Ministers are saying that the 1988 legislation - then a subject of impassioned debate over sex education books such as Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin - was hopelessly badly drafted. Its existence deters teachers from providing either protection or pastoral care to vulnerable gay teenagers, pro-reformers argue. \"The practical implications of this is that a lot of teachers don't understand what they can teach,\" one said last night. One third of teachers still believe they are bound by the section not to do anything to promote homosexuality, Downing Street conceded last night. \"We have seen outbreaks of homophobic bullying, we have gay and lesbian pupils and indeed adults feeling that they had got no response from the authorities for addressing their problems,\" Lord Whitty said on BBC Radio 4's The World at One. \"What we are talking about here is discrimination against a significant minority of our citizens, many of whom find themselves in quite serious emotional difficulty.\" The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"To read some of the papers in Scotland, you would think being gay was being put on the national curriculum, that people are being taught to be gay. It's not like that. \"He (Mr Blair) is a parent as well as a prime minister and simply doesn't accept that repeal would do what the opponents say.\" The danger of a socially conservative backlash against the government's Queen's speech commitment spreading to England became evident yesterday when the Catholic bishop of Liverpool, the Rt Rev James Jones, joined Cardinal Thomas Winning, the Catholic primate in Scotland, in publicly opposing repeal of section 28. More cautiously, George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, also called for safeguards in schools and warned against putting \"homosexual relations on an equal footing with marriage.\" Unwilling to pick a fight, Downing Street says everyone is entitled to their view, but insists that \"a tolerant UK in which everyone feels comfortable with themselves\" is best served by removal of section 28 which prevents \"intentional\" promotion of homosexuality. The Lords have already rejected sexual equality at 16 this session, claiming that expulsion of the hereditary peers gives it new legitimacy to thwart the elected Commons. John Redwood, the Tory Commons spokesman, last night warned against repeal. But he admitted the law might need to be amended even though, as it stands, it does not provide \"any legal impediments to teachers tackling bullying\".",

Both of these shows are unlike anything shown during prime time, which is great if you've got insomnia, but not if you have to get up in the morning.",

Cathy has never been to any of her four-year-old son's open days, and puts him into an \"after-school club\" every evening until she can pick him up. The little boy recently announced that he hates his mother. Both women appeared exhausted and unwell; Cathy doesn't eat or sleep properly, and Penny feels she's on the verge of a nervous breakdown. </p> <p> These women are obviously on the horns of a painful dilemma. Penny is the main breadwinner and, anyway, enjoys the stimulation of going out to work. Cathy is loath to watch a successful pre-motherhood career go down the plughole. It was at this point that certain obvious options could have been addressed: both women were married, but it was never suggested that their husbands might give up work and look after the children. Both were double-income households, but there was little discussion of giving up one salary and living a humbler, more frugal lifestyle while the children needed day care. There was much talk of \"having it all\", but nobody ever seemed to consider that having children might mean making sacrifices.</p> <p> Instead they laboured under a daily burden of guilt, sending unwell children to school because there was nobody at home to look after them, hoping that the misery of childhood would be forgotten in later years. To make matters even worse, some research was trotted out to suggest that academic achievement in later life is directly related to the mother's employment during the pre-school years. Anecdotal information suggested that legislation to protect working mothers will actually put employers off the whole idea of hiring women of prime child-bearing age. </p> <p>With the evidence stacking up so horrendously, it's hardly surprising that Cathy gave up her job and went freelance. Ultimately, Panorama raised more questions than it was prepared to answer. The conclusion was that working motherhood isn't working at all - it would be hard to think otherwise after such a parade of domestic misery. But anyone who suggested that parenthood and career don't necessarily mix - that the problem lies not with unsympathetic employers but with parents trying to lead two lives - was demonised as an enemy of women's rights. </p> <p> Far, far away from these vexing issues, in a sunlit kitchen in East Anglia, Delia Smith got to grips with meat. A definite religious vibe permeates Delia's How To Cook - Part Two (BBC2), from the hymn-like opening music to the lovely close-ups of flowers that punctuate the chopping and frying. No worries about work or childcare here: no worries, even, about the unpromising slop that will turn into a delicious steak and kidney pie. \"You'll have to trust me\", said Delia, and we do, we do. </p> <p> The scheduling of Delia's How To Cook at 8.30pm is a stroke of genius: after most people have eaten, but before their stomachs have shut down for the night. As mini boeuf-en-croutes were cut open to reveal pink, glistening interiors, the food-loving nation staggered towards the television with little inarticulate cries of hunger. (Vegetarians, one can only hope, were still washing up.) Last night's episode ended with yet more delicious glimpses of food that we can only learn how to cook if we buy the book, although Delia is too discreet to state the fact baldly. </p> <p>She was not too discreet, however, to make a blatant bid for a longer slot. \"Until we get longer cookery programmes,\" she said, with a rare steely glint in her eye, \"that's all we've got time for.\" Would anyone dare refuse her?

In conventional political terms, that is. But ultimately Jones is not a politician, conventional or unconventional. He is an evangelical Christian priest who believes firmly in the rightness of the New Testament, and sooner or later all the passion for social justice comes back to that.</p> <p>That's why the bishop popped up in the Daily Telegraph yesterday, throwing in his lot with the campaign in Scotland to keep Clause 28, the Tory-introduced measure which, by forbidding local authorities to \"promote\" homosexuality, has prevented schoolteachers from even raising the topic in the classroom. In his article, the bishop defended Cardinal Thomas Winning, the spiritual leader of Scotland's Roman Catholics, who last week called homosexuals \"perverted\" and at the weekend - though Jones may not have been aware of this - said \"an active and militant homosexual lobby\" at work across Europe was comparable to Nazi bombers during the second world war.</p> <p>Cardinal Winning has led the pro-Clause 28 campaign north of the border. Of the Catholic cleric's earlier anti-repeal efforts, Jones wrote: \"Cardinal Winning's intervention makes an appeal over the heads of the gatekeepers of political correctness direct to the silent constituency.\" He went on: \"Much is made of the equal rights of gay people to express their sexuality and fulfil the desire of their heart and body. But the Christian moral tradition has never taken the view that just because we have certain desires we ought to give them expression.\"</p> <p>The media-savvy bishop was avoiding the media yesterday, pleading a packed schedule. How ever, he agreed to talk to the Guardian. \"I don't think education can be free of values and moral priorities,\" he said. \"The next question is: are gay and straight relations morally equivalent? It seems to me, there's a social and moral priority to a family based on marriage. That's establishing a priority over the gay relationship.</p> <p>\"A civilised society must respect those of different viewpoints. I readily admit that there is homophobia and that homosexuals have been oppressed in our society, but not everybody who says there is a moral and social priority to family life is necessarily homophobic.\"</p> <p>In his article, the bishop called for schoolchildren to be introduced to gay and heterosexual people who had chosen celibacy. He said he respected homosexual people, but made clear that in his view the Bible and \"natural theology\" were authoritatively against it, said that gay sex was more threatening to health than straight sex, pointed out that if everyone was gay there wouldn't be any children, and even delved into anatomical detail. \"Physiologically,\" he observed, \"the genitalia are manifestly designed for the opposite, and not the same, gender.\"</p> <p>One of the ironies of Bishop Jones's position is that, as a religious education teacher himself before Clause 28 was introduced, he was able to - and did - discuss homosexuality in the classroom without fear of prosecution. He told the Guardian yesterday that Clause 28 didn't prevent this, but the advice of education authority lawyers to teachers tempted to test the vaguely worded clause by mentioning the H-word has consistently been: don't risk it.</p> <p>Bishop Jones sounded genuinely upset that anyone could interpret his position as hostile to homosexuals. His responses were seeded with the irreproachable vocabulary of tolerance: \"respect different viewpoints\", \"both sides of the argument\", \"taking the debate beyond sloganising and name-calling\".</p> <p>Yet what is a gay man or lesbian to make of this paragraph from his article, which seems to suggest homosexuality is bad because it provokes people who don't like it? \"The consequences of homosexual acts provide a field day for prejudice,\" he writes. \"Do they lead to stable relationships? Is there something about male homosexuality that renders it inimical to faithful relationships? While some gays point to committed partnerships, others see the pressure to keep to one partner as an oppression by the heterosexual community.\"</p> <p>Asked about this, the bishop said: \"As I read gay literature, these are the questions that are being asked.\" Many in the church see the bishop as saying openly what the current Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey - another evangelical and a fan of Bishop Jones - only thinks, although Dr Carey also ventured a shot across the bows of the government's intention to abolish Clause 28 this week.</p> <p>Yet the bishop may believe he can somehow align himself with scourges of liberal sexuality such as Cardinal Winning and not be seen as anti-gay.

There are several theories about it and I would not rush into judgment.\"</p> <p>Bishop Jones's stance came as little surprise to those within the church struggling to keep liberal voices heard. \"I think we must simply face the fact that a substantial proportion of the church, not just church leaders but what I would call grassroots Christians, have inherited centuries of theology and alleged Biblical teaching which says that the practice of homosexuality is a sin,\" said Paul Oestreicher, canon resident at Coventry Cathedral.</p> <p>Another liberal said the bishop had at least shown some integrity in jeopardising his chances of advancement by speaking out. \"Full marks to him for speaking his mind,\" he said. \"It's just a shame now we know what's in it.\"</p>",

One MP is undeclared but is believed to be voting for Dobson On this basis, the share of vote as a percentage of the electoral college is: Dobson 27.927% Livingstone 4.504% Jackson 0.9% Unions plus MPs Dobson estimated 37.484% Livingstone estimated 28.543% Jackson estimated 1.287% Dobson needs a further 12.517% of the electoral college from the members section Livingstone needs a further 21.458% of the electoral college from the members section Party members Labour says about 49,000 Labour party members will be eligible to vote (those who joined on or before September 24, 1999 and have paid up at the time the ballot papers go out). Ballot papers go out tomorrow and have to be returned by February 16. There is likely to be at least a three-day delay to allow votes to be counted, and to give time for representations to be made. Unity Balloting Services is conducting the ballot. The result is likely to be announced on February 21 According to Guardian calculations: Dobson needs 37.371% of members' votes to win the electoral college outright Livingstone needs 64.374% of members' votes to win the electoral college outright If either MP fails to win that number of votes, transfers from Glenda Jackson will decide the election",

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone appears to have a remarkable victory within his grasp in the race to become Labour's candidate for mayor of London, according to a detailed analysis by the Guardian. On the eve of ballot papers being posted to party members, calculations suggest that the leftwing MP for Brent East could win the party's nomination outright with 64.3% of the votes of activists. This is very close to the 66% suggested by Mr Livingstone's own surveys and within a whisker of previous polling indications. According to the survey of votes being cast by the electoral college, his main challenger, Frank Dobson, needs around 37.3% to win outright on first-choice votes. The electoral college is divided up into thirds: one third for the members; one third for MPs and representatives; and one share for unions and affiliated organisations. The third candidate, Glenda Jackson, has become increasingly hostile to Millbank and Downing Street through the selection process. \"There is no doubt that Ken will win, but we think he will win on the first ballot,\" her spokesman said, predicting that Mr Dobson would come third in the constituency section. If neither Mr Livingstone nor Mr Dobson achieves an overall majority, the second preference votes given to Ms Jackson will decide the election. A poll at the weekend suggested that Mr Livingstone had the support of 63% of Labour party members, with Mr Dobson on 25% and Ms Jackson 12%. That scenario would also appear to tilt the election Mr Livingstone's way. Certainly Ms Jackson's camp think so. \"Our analysis is that between two-thirds and three-quarters of her second preferences will go to Ken,\" a spokesman for Ms Jackson said last night - a view shared by the Livingstone camp. Ms Jackson will decide who to name as her second choice after a ballot in her Hampstead constituency. \"Glenda has become a catalyst for party loyalists who have become disillusioned with the way that the selection is being conducted and the excesses of some of the elements in New Labour,\" said her spokesman. But the temptation to cast Ms Jackson in the role of \"kingmaker\" was resisted by sceptics last night. Her decision on her second preference vote may have a small bearing on her supporters, but will not be the only factor playing on their minds. Many will not be prepared to vote for Mr Liv ingstone as their second choice, and others will not put down a second choice at all. Her only other supporter in the MPs' section of the electoral college, Stephen Pound, said he would vote for Mr Dobson as his second choice. He said he would even rethink his vote for Ms Jackson if she accepted an offer, made at the weekend, to become Mr Livingstone's deputy. \"I genuinely think he would be a disaster for London,\" he said.

He triumphed in one of the biggest shocks of the 1948 London Olympiad, where the pundits had expected him to merely help his team-mate, Lennart Strand, to victory. Because of the second world war, the revival of the Olympic games was conspicuous for a shortage of top-class middle-distance runners, with both Great Britain and the United States completely stripped of their quality competitors in the field. Only the Swedes, who had remained neutral during the war, had progressed. At the London games, they were expected to sweep all three medals, thanks to Strand, Eriksson and Gosta Bergkvist.

      "body": "<p>The painter Norman Blamey, who has died aged 85, was a consummate draughtsman specialising in contemplative domestic subjects and episodes from the liturgy of the Anglo-Catholic church. His paintings have only recently been given due recognition, for both his subject and his style were unusual, but he brought to his work an intensity that expresses not only the spirituality of high Anglicans but of all who value ritual.</p> <p>The setting of Blamey's religious pieces was usually Old St Pancras church, London, where he worshipped all his life, and his pictures sometimes show him as an assistant in the ritual.</p> <p>In his work, the sense of the spiritual was translated into a crystalline geometry, worked out with a fascination for mathematics worthy of the early renaissance masters. Space is telescoped, manipulated to form tightly-knit compositions in which the human figure creates powerful patterns. The depictions of ritual make telling use of this device, with lines of repeated cassocks and copes building up magnificent counterpoint, while dull tertiary colours, with greys and whites, supply a rich, subdued harmony.</p> <p>Blamey was born in St Pancras, the only son of a manufacturing chemist and his wife. His first studies in art were at the Regent Street polytechnic, and he went on to teach there himself. He first showed at the Royal Academy in 1938, and continued to do so for 50 years. His war was spent with the army in Egypt, Palestine and the Lebanon, where, in hospital, he made a series of fine drawings of his fellow patients.</p> <p>After the war, Blamey returned to the Regent Street poly, and, in the 1950s, began to produce the sequence of paintings of ritual that forms the backbone of his output. In 1956, he was commissioned to decorate the apse of St Luke's church, Leagrave, Luton; the result, the imposing Christ In His Glory, reflects Byzantine stylisation.</p> <p>In it, Blamey adopted pronounced distortions of the figure in this decade, devices which he was later to regard as unsatisfactory, mere lip-service to modernism. They are often, nevertheless, powerfully effective, and betray the great impression made on him by Stanley Spencer's work, notably at Burghclere chapel, and by van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece, which he first saw as a 19-year-old in 1933.</p> <p>Another mural, for the Lutheran church of St Andrew, Ruislip Manor, was executed in 1964. Blamey's career saw the steady elimination of mannerisms, until, by the 1970s, he was painting with a realistic directness strengthened by his unfailing dedication to pictorial geometry. This is embodied in the paint itself, applied with a palette knife, often guided by the straight edge of masking tape. (He is said to have used the same palette knife for some 40 years.)</p> <p>These technical comments apply as much to Blamey's domestic subjects as to his ecclesiastical ones. Enclosed spaces are defined and amplified by mirrors, reflections rendered ambiguous by the presence of the miscellanea of an artist's collecting - fossils, flints, small sculptures, postcards. His models are usually Margaret, his wife, whom he married in 1948, and his son, Stephen.</p> <p>Blamey was a very private man, and his pictures reflect that. When he painted himself, it was usually to make a pictorial statement about the artist's viewpoint, rather than to record a personality in which he took interest. But he painted fine portraits, too, the work of an incisive and humane mind.</p> <p>He continued to teach at Chelsea School of Art, where he was senior lecturer from 1963-79, and, after his election as a royal academician in 1975, as visiting lecturer at the RA schools. Blamey believed passionately in the traditional disciplines of the draughtsman, but was too retiring to pronounce on them, and taught by example, making drawings himself to show how he thought things should be done.</p> <p>His gentle reserve and modesty were commensurate with the concentrated power of his painting. He did not expect success; indeed when he was invited to a celebratory lunch on his 80th birthday at the Tate Gallery, which had acquired several of his works, he remarked: \"I had to keep pinching myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming.\" A one-man show was organised by Lynda Checketts for the Norwich Gallery in 1992; it travelled to the Victoria Art Gallery, Bath, and the Fine Art Society, London. He was awarded the OBE in 1998.</p> <p>Blamey's wife died in 1989. He is survived by his son.</p> <p>Norman Charles Blamey, artist, born December 16 1914; died January 17 2000</p>",

The depictions of ritual make telling use of this device, with lines of repeated cassocks and copes building up magnificent counterpoint, while dull tertiary colours, with greys and whites, supply a rich, subdued harmony. Blamey was born in St Pancras, the only son of a manufacturing chemist and his wife. His first studies in art were at the Regent Street polytechnic, and he went on to teach there himself. He first showed at the Royal Academy in 1938, and continued to do so for 50 years. His war was spent with the army in Egypt, Palestine and the Lebanon, where, in hospital, he made a series of fine drawings of his fellow patients. After the war, Blamey returned to the Regent Street poly, and, in the 1950s, began to produce the sequence of paintings of ritual that forms the backbone of his output. In 1956, he was commissioned to decorate the apse of St Luke's church, Leagrave, Luton; the result, the imposing Christ In His Glory, reflects Byzantine stylisation. In it, Blamey adopted pronounced distortions of the figure in this decade, devices which he was later to regard as unsatisfactory, mere lip-service to modernism. They are often, nevertheless, powerfully effective, and betray the great impression made on him by Stanley Spencer's work, notably at Burghclere chapel, and by van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece, which he first saw as a 19-year-old in 1933. Another mural, for the Lutheran church of St Andrew, Ruislip Manor, was executed in 1964. Blamey's career saw the steady elimination of mannerisms, until, by the 1970s, he was painting with a realistic directness strengthened by his unfailing dedication to pictorial geometry. This is embodied in the paint itself, applied with a palette knife, often guided by the straight edge of masking tape. (He is said to have used the same palette knife for some 40 years.) These technical comments apply as much to Blamey's domestic subjects as to his ecclesiastical ones. Enclosed spaces are defined and amplified by mirrors, reflections rendered ambiguous by the presence of the miscellanea of an artist's collecting - fossils, flints, small sculptures, postcards. His models are usually Margaret, his wife, whom he married in 1948, and his son, Stephen. Blamey was a very private man, and his pictures reflect that. When he painted himself, it was usually to make a pictorial statement about the artist's viewpoint, rather than to record a personality in which he took interest. But he painted fine portraits, too, the work of an incisive and humane mind. He continued to teach at Chelsea School of Art, where he was senior lecturer from 1963-79, and, after his election as a royal academician in 1975, as visiting lecturer at the RA schools. Blamey believed passionately in the traditional disciplines of the draughtsman, but was too retiring to pronounce on them, and taught by example, making drawings himself to show how he thought things should be done. His gentle reserve and modesty were commensurate with the concentrated power of his painting. He did not expect success; indeed when he was invited to a celebratory lunch on his 80th birthday at the Tate Gallery, which had acquired several of his works, he remarked: \"I had to keep pinching myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming.\" A one-man show was organised by Lynda Checketts for the Norwich Gallery in 1992; it travelled to the Victoria Art Gallery, Bath, and the Fine Art Society, London. He was awarded the OBE in 1998. Blamey's wife died in 1989. He is survived by his son. Norman Charles Blamey, artist, born December 16 1914; died January 17 2000",

Extraordinary examples of non-Hindus being described as foreigners, attempts to defend the caste system and even a laudatory account of Hitler are being pointed to as examples of an attempt by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the dominant partner of the ruling coalition, to influence attitudes by stealth. For example, an examination question in the state of Uttar Pradesh asked: \"If it takes four Savaks [Hindu religious workers] to demolish one mosque, how many does it take to demolish 20?\" Teesta Setalvad, a prominent campaigner against the changes, said: \"Prejudice is being bred among children.

The [education] minister has made his intentions amply clear.\" She fears not only that deliberate distortions are being written into textbooks by pro-BJP academics, but that at a time of heightened tensions with Pakistan, the country's schools are fuelling intolerance. Although the central government does not have control of the curriculum, India's state governments do, and changes in textbooks are arising in all states, but especially those with a BJP majority. Murli Manohar Joshi, India's human resources development minister with responsibility for education, has called for textbooks to be overhauled and \"enthused with national spirit\", and has attacked \"myopic western mind-sets\" in the Indian education system. In Rajasthan, a recently issued text on conversation points and essay writing techniques depicts a pupil discussing India's nuclear weapons tests with his teacher. It reads: \"Student: 'Master, what has India achieved by doing the nuclear tests? Was it a right step?' Teacher: 'Undoubtedly it was correct, India has achieved a huge success.' \"Student: 'What success? Economic sanctions have been slapped on.' Teacher: 'Economic sanctions do not matter.

Meanwhile, his defence team says it will produce witnesses who can account for Anwar's whereabouts on the night six years ago when he allegedly sodomised his former family driver. For Dr Mahathir's United Malays National Organisation (Umno), the trial reconvenes amid growing discontent within Umno's ranks and elsewhere. Its party faithful, who were demoralised by the results of November's general elections despite the Barisan Nasional coalition's retention of a two-thirds parliamentary majority, saw a depletion of their Malay powerbase, particularly in the north, their traditional heartland. There is also growing concern within the ruling coalition about the potential for renewed street protests to coincide with the resumption of the trial today. Despite the prime minister's calls to stop complaining, Umno members are increasingly voicing their displeasure with \"Malaysian politics as usual\". A particular bone of contention is the Umno supreme council's decision to reject calls for the party's top two positions to be elected from within the party in May. \"I believe Umno has to make changes which are tailored along the aspirations of the people, especially the Malays, who spoke through the ballot box,\" the former finance minister, Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, told the pro-government New Straits Times on Friday. But the high price of public dissent continues to censor Dr Mahatir's critics; publishing an editorial questioning the Umno council's decision appears to have cost the New Straits Times editor, Kadir Jasin, his job last week. Mr Kadir stepped down on January 18 under pressure from senior politicians who were angry that he had the audacity to question the council's decision. His demise surprised even his critics. \"We all know that the mainstream media is at the beck and call of the authority of the day,\" Mr Lim said from Kuala Lumpur. \"But [Mr Kadir] had to step down not because he was disloyal, not because he did not try to serve the [Barisan Nasional] - even to the extent of dishing out false truths - but because he was not seen as a totally compliant creature.\" The mainstream media and Mr Kadir appear to be in a no-win situation; reviled by the Malay on the street for being an unbending government mouthpiece, while criticised by the ruling coalition for inadequately portraying its campaign message in November. After another two months in isolation at a high-security prison outside Kuala Lumpur where he was only allowed a family visit every three weeks, Anwar is reported to be in good spirits. \"He is a fighter,\" said Sankara Nair, a member of his defence team.

      "body": "<p>An American-Israeli submarine mission is preparing to dredge an Austrian lake said to have been the dumping ground for Nazi gold and Third Reich archives, including information relating to secret Swiss bank accounts.</p> <p>Lake Toplitz in Upper Austria has been the subject of rumours for more than half a century, fuelled mainly by witness accounts that senior Nazis deposited their booty in its 100 metre depths in the final days of the war.</p> <p>The lake was part of the so-called Alpine fortress in the Salzkammergut region, which was designated the last Nazi stronghold. Hitler picked the area and is believed to have ordered the Third Reich's treasures to be transported there.</p> <p>Millions of pounds have been pumped into recovery projects over the years, with varying degrees of success. In the 1960s several Austrian government diving missions uncovered hundreds of thousands of pound notes with which the Nazis planned to flood the money markets to destabilise Britain's economy.</p> <p>Now an Israeli journalist whose family was murdered by the Nazis has persuaded the company that located the Titanic to bring its expertise to bear. Yaron Svoray says he will not be satisfied that there is nothing there until every inch of the lake has been scoured.</p> <p>\"I lost my family in a concentration camp,\" he said. \"I am hopeful that files and records which pertain to them might be recovered.\"</p> <p>Next month computer-controlled mini submarines and divers from the Maryland-based company, Oceaneering, will begin a 10-week search. The initial stage will involve compiling the first complete picture of the lake, using video cameras and sonar equipment. If anything is spotted, a salvage operation will begin.</p> <p>\"We will either be discovering history or establishing that this is a legend,\" said Ridgely Albaugh, one of the project leaders from Oceaneering, which was also involved in recovering the remains of the exploded Challenger space shutle from the Atlantic in 1986.</p> <p>The team was reluctant to reveal details, but their interest is believed to focus on Nazi secret service files which could lead to the identification of Swiss and other foreign bank accounts where German capital was transferred towards the end of the war.</p> <p>It is unclear why the project is being carried out in the middle of winter. The lake is covered by a 30cm thick ice sheet.</p> <p>\"We hope that as well as possible treasures, documents will finally come to light, particularly name lists or registers, which indicate where the Third Reich chiefs hid their money,\" said the Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal, who is supporting the mission.</p> <p>But some experts remain sceptical.

      "bodyText": "An American-Israeli submarine mission is preparing to dredge an Austrian lake said to have been the dumping ground for Nazi gold and Third Reich archives, including information relating to secret Swiss bank accounts. Lake Toplitz in Upper Austria has been the subject of rumours for more than half a century, fuelled mainly by witness accounts that senior Nazis deposited their booty in its 100 metre depths in the final days of the war. The lake was part of the so-called Alpine fortress in the Salzkammergut region, which was designated the last Nazi stronghold. Hitler picked the area and is believed to have ordered the Third Reich's treasures to be transported there. Millions of pounds have been pumped into recovery projects over the years, with varying degrees of success. In the 1960s several Austrian government diving missions uncovered hundreds of thousands of pound notes with which the Nazis planned to flood the money markets to destabilise Britain's economy. Now an Israeli journalist whose family was murdered by the Nazis has persuaded the company that located the Titanic to bring its expertise to bear. Yaron Svoray says he will not be satisfied that there is nothing there until every inch of the lake has been scoured. \"I lost my family in a concentration camp,\" he said. \"I am hopeful that files and records which pertain to them might be recovered.\" Next month computer-controlled mini submarines and divers from the Maryland-based company, Oceaneering, will begin a 10-week search. The initial stage will involve compiling the first complete picture of the lake, using video cameras and sonar equipment. If anything is spotted, a salvage operation will begin. \"We will either be discovering history or establishing that this is a legend,\" said Ridgely Albaugh, one of the project leaders from Oceaneering, which was also involved in recovering the remains of the exploded Challenger space shutle from the Atlantic in 1986. The team was reluctant to reveal details, but their interest is believed to focus on Nazi secret service files which could lead to the identification of Swiss and other foreign bank accounts where German capital was transferred towards the end of the war. It is unclear why the project is being carried out in the middle of winter. The lake is covered by a 30cm thick ice sheet. \"We hope that as well as possible treasures, documents will finally come to light, particularly name lists or registers, which indicate where the Third Reich chiefs hid their money,\" said the Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal, who is supporting the mission. But some experts remain sceptical. Markus Koeberl, an historian and author of the book Toplitzsee, said: \"I think anything the lake was hiding has already been discovered.\" Mr Koeberl said the mystification around the lake stemmed from the fact that it was closed to the public from 1943. The Nazis then used it to test underwater weaponry. But Patrick Loftus, who was a prisoner of war and slave labourer at Lake Toplitz, said: \"I saw with my own eyes how the Nazis drove to the edge of the lake and threw boxes of treasure into the water.\" In 1963 a former Nazi officer, Maximilian Gruber, told police he had seen officers throwing gold medals and diamonds into the lake under orders from the Nazi foreign minister, Joachim Ribbentrop. He later retracted the statement, saying: \"I lied because I hoped that if anything was found during a search they would give me a reward.\" He was later convicted of fraud.",

(This idea was supplied by a Ms Sarah Macaulay.) 79 Hire groups of Morris dancers to prance around it, claiming that it is an ancient fertility symbol. 80 Strangle any Morris dancers who show up with the laces of their own ridiculous jangling footwear. 81 Set a match to it and claim it is the Millennium \"Dome of Fire\". 82 What do you mean, you didn't see anything happen? 83 Paint it a tortoiseshell hue, write FREDA in white paint, and wait for Peter Purves to turn up. 84 Tickle it with a feather and claim you can hear it giggling. 85 Use it as a venue for the comeback concert by the Mike Sammes Singers. 86 Paint \"time capsule\" on it, cover it with earth, and enjoy the excitement on Blue Peter on January 1 3000. 87 There is no 87. 88 Stand it on its side and customise with pedals and saddle, to enable buskers to do an impressive unicycling act. 89 Turn it upside down, wet the rim with your finger and make it \"sing\" like a glass. 90 Turn it upside down, tow it to Sicily and it use as an ashtray for Mount Etna. 91 Paint a dartboard grid on top and fire Jocky Wilson at it with a dart strapped to his forehead. 92 Turn it into a giant Marks &amp; Spencer (it couldn't be less successful than it is at the moment). 93 Increase its value by thrashing it with birch twigs for an antique \"distressed\" finish. 94 Install leg irons and use as secure holding centre for parents who transgress the new anti-smacking regulations. 95 Turn it into the cabinet enforcer's office - don't worry about the lack of car parking facilities. 96 Supply this one yourself - have you ever tried to do 101 jokes?! 97 Put a man and a woman inside, lock the doors, wait 2m years and, hey presto, humanity. 98 Cover it with ppier mach\u00e9, let it harden, poke a hole in the ppier mach\u00e9 with a pin, deflate the dome and say: \"Wow, a ppier mach\u00e9 dome.\" 99 Use it as a prototype for the new Ulti-bra. 101 Use it as an exciting publicly funded venue for a celebration of the millennium, with a Body Zone, Faith Zone, Talk Zone . . . sorry, that's a stupid idea.",

      "body": "<p>As many as 2,000 people are expected to attend rallies throughout the US today to try to protect an ice-cream company. Their slogan is \"multi-flavours not multi-nationals\". </p> <p>The coalition to save Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade formed last month, when the company announced that it had received several takeover approaches from multinational competitors. The anger felt in Vermont, the homeland of the firm's founders, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, and the beneficiary of many of their socially responsible projects, soon spread across the US. </p> <p>Campaigners expect thousands to congregate at its shops in nine US cities at midday today. Wavy Gravy and Patch Adams, idols of the Woodstock generation, will attend two rallies. More than 8,000 people have clicked on <a href=\"http://www.savethecownow.com\">savethecownow.com</a>, one of several campaign websites, and organisers hope the protest will spread to shops in Canada, Europe and Japan. </p> <p>Many groups opposed to the power of big business are united in the fight to keep Ben &amp; Jerry's independent. The organisers suggest it is a continuation of last November's battle in Seattle, when anti-trade demonstrators disrupted the meeting of the World Trade Organisation. </p> <p>Judy Wicks, owner of the White Dog Cafe in Philadelphia, does not even sell Ben &amp; Jerry's. But she has become a campaign organiser through her involvement with the National Organisation of Progressive Businesses. \"We can't just remain silent about what's going on at Ben &amp; Jerry's,\" she said. \"They have been leaders in the community and many people have felt influenced by them.\" A takeover by a large corporation would be \"another nail in the coffin for locally-based businesses\". </p> <p>At the heart of the campaign is the fear that huge, faceless multinationals have too much power. \"There are a lot of concerned people including some of the folk who were involved with Seattle,\" Ms Wicks said. </p> <p>The fight is not just an ideological one, however. Many campaigners feel that they have much to lose if anticipated bids from corporate food giants Unilever, Diageo or Dreyer's materialise. </p> <p>Common Ground, a charity that provides shelter for the homeless in New York, is one of several groups supported by Ben &amp; Jerry's. The ice-cream firm waives its franchise fee for the charity, which operates a \"scoop shop\" near Times Square that provides training and work experience for formerly homeless people. Toby Sherman at Common Ground said: \"A takeover would be particularly challenging for us.

      "bodyText": "As many as 2,000 people are expected to attend rallies throughout the US today to try to protect an ice-cream company. Their slogan is \"multi-flavours not multi-nationals\". The coalition to save Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade formed last month, when the company announced that it had received several takeover approaches from multinational competitors. The anger felt in Vermont, the homeland of the firm's founders, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, and the beneficiary of many of their socially responsible projects, soon spread across the US. Campaigners expect thousands to congregate at its shops in nine US cities at midday today. Wavy Gravy and Patch Adams, idols of the Woodstock generation, will attend two rallies. More than 8,000 people have clicked on savethecownow.com, one of several campaign websites, and organisers hope the protest will spread to shops in Canada, Europe and Japan. Many groups opposed to the power of big business are united in the fight to keep Ben &amp; Jerry's independent. The organisers suggest it is a continuation of last November's battle in Seattle, when anti-trade demonstrators disrupted the meeting of the World Trade Organisation. Judy Wicks, owner of the White Dog Cafe in Philadelphia, does not even sell Ben &amp; Jerry's. But she has become a campaign organiser through her involvement with the National Organisation of Progressive Businesses. \"We can't just remain silent about what's going on at Ben &amp; Jerry's,\" she said. \"They have been leaders in the community and many people have felt influenced by them.\" A takeover by a large corporation would be \"another nail in the coffin for locally-based businesses\". At the heart of the campaign is the fear that huge, faceless multinationals have too much power. \"There are a lot of concerned people including some of the folk who were involved with Seattle,\" Ms Wicks said. The fight is not just an ideological one, however. Many campaigners feel that they have much to lose if anticipated bids from corporate food giants Unilever, Diageo or Dreyer's materialise. Common Ground, a charity that provides shelter for the homeless in New York, is one of several groups supported by Ben &amp; Jerry's. The ice-cream firm waives its franchise fee for the charity, which operates a \"scoop shop\" near Times Square that provides training and work experience for formerly homeless people. Toby Sherman at Common Ground said: \"A takeover would be particularly challenging for us. We can't be certain that the level of support we receive would stay intact.\" As well as donating almost 8% of group pre-tax profits to charities each year, Ben &amp; Jerry's also espouses popular environmental causes. It uses locally-produced, hormone-free milk to create its ice-cream.

      "bodyText": "Investigations at collapsed trading group Versailles are focusing on the secretive \"client services department\" that kept confidential details of clients amid concerns that several customers either did not exist or had ceased to trade, sources said yesterday. The department's separate sets of accounts make it very difficult to trace back from the published figures to work out which deals generated Versailles's explosive profits growth during the 1990s. The group's profits grew from nothing to more than \u00a316m annually in less than a decade. It has become clear that the company's client services department - which had its own computer and operated quite separately from the Versailles accounts department - has become pivotal to the inquiry. The serious fraud office and receivers PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) are investigating Versailles. Records from the client services department may be critical in establishing the group's relationship with the private offshore interests that funded Versailles during its early days and are thought to have supported it during more recent difficulties. This funding group is thought to be registered in the British Virgin Islands, and the SFO is believed to be planning to request information from the authorities in the Caribbean tax haven. Group members are not registered as shareholders and there are suggestions that the money they circulated through Versailles may have been disguised as fees from clients. The accounts of the client services department should help to show whether these suggestions are true or false. Meanwhile, the London office of Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, yesterday denied ever having employed anyone named \"A. Mills,\" the self-styled company analyst who early last year wrote to national newspapers urging them to write in glowing terms of Carl Cushnie, founder of Versailles, describing him as a \"truly self-made man\". At least one newspaper did quote the \"analyst\", but Goldman said it had never followed the shares of Versailles, which - even in its heyday last year - was too small to attract the bank's attention. The true identity, and motivation, of \"A Mills\" remains a mystery. Versailles's accounts first came under scrutiny last year, when the department of trade and industry was investigating the collapse of a Versailles client. It was unhappy with aspects of Versailles's book-keeping and prompted the company to order an independent audit. An audit took place and was unable to give the books a clean bill of health. Versailles asked on December 8 for its shares to be suspended, and PwC began an inquiry on behalf of the group's banks.

The increase failed, however, to erase a decline of almost 20% since the talks were first reported last week.</p> <p>Durk Jager, P&amp;G's chairman and chief executive, blamed a series of news reports for his decision to call off talks which started three weeks ago.</p> <p>\"We have concluded that leaks and resulting speculation on a possible transaction have created an environment in which we cannot continue meaningful discussions,\" he said.</p> <p>In a statement that revealed frustration over his failure to convince shareholders of the value of what could have been one of the world's biggest takeovers, Mr Jager said: \"We believed Warner-Lambert, American Home Products and P&amp;G could have been a blockbuster combination of technology, marketing and scale capabilities. It would have created substantial shareholder value with minimal up-front dilution.\"</p> <p>A company spokesman ad mitted that the shareholder reaction to two takeovers, valued together at about $140bn, had been \"a factor\" in the decision to call off talks.</p> <p>The move leaves Warner-Lambert and AHP in awkward positions in an increasingly tortuous bid battle.</p> <p>Warner-Lambert had been in merger discussions with AHP before Pfizer, a rival drugs group, launched a $78bn hostile bid. Pfizer was rebuffed by Warner-Lambert and AHP, which sought out P&amp;G as a friendly saviour.

      "bodyText": "Procter &amp; Gamble yesterday bowed to shareholders who demanded an end to takeover talks with two rival drugs companies that might have created a rival to the new giant GlaxoSmithkline. Shares in P&amp;G rose sharply on the announcement that it had terminated discussions with Warner-Lambert and American Home Products. The increase failed, however, to erase a decline of almost 20% since the talks were first reported last week. Durk Jager, P&amp;G's chairman and chief executive, blamed a series of news reports for his decision to call off talks which started three weeks ago. \"We have concluded that leaks and resulting speculation on a possible transaction have created an environment in which we cannot continue meaningful discussions,\" he said. In a statement that revealed frustration over his failure to convince shareholders of the value of what could have been one of the world's biggest takeovers, Mr Jager said: \"We believed Warner-Lambert, American Home Products and P&amp;G could have been a blockbuster combination of technology, marketing and scale capabilities. It would have created substantial shareholder value with minimal up-front dilution.\" A company spokesman ad mitted that the shareholder reaction to two takeovers, valued together at about $140bn, had been \"a factor\" in the decision to call off talks. The move leaves Warner-Lambert and AHP in awkward positions in an increasingly tortuous bid battle. Warner-Lambert had been in merger discussions with AHP before Pfizer, a rival drugs group, launched a $78bn hostile bid. Pfizer was rebuffed by Warner-Lambert and AHP, which sought out P&amp;G as a friendly saviour. Warner-Lambert said yesterday that it was continuing to explore its options. Analysts also expressed some wariness about P&amp;G, where Mr Jager, appointed last year, has taken an unusually aggressive position at a company previously seen as averse to large corporate deals. The group's board was understood to have agreed to continue talks with the drugs companies only last Friday, in spite of the unsupportive reaction from shareholders. A company spokesman said that the group would continue to look at \"strategic acquisitions as a key part of our growth strategy\". He refused to comment on reports that it had approached Gillette, the underperforming razor company. P&amp;G, which sells 300 brands of household goods in 140 countries, is keen to extend its large marketing and distribution network into more products.",

A picture pops into my mind: a stencilled human silhouette contorted against a yellow background, a black lightning zigzag delivering a fatal punch. The kind of enamelled sign they fix to the local electricity substation. \"Don't go too close. Danger of death\", it says. </p> <p>Listen more attentively and the noise separates into harmonics, a 50 kilohertz hymn to the mighty electron, whirring at 50,000 cycles a second. It could almost be by Gyorgy Ligeti. Listen hard enough and any noise has music in it. At home, I harmonise with the Hoover. Is this what composers do? The sound here is a carefully modulated mix, derived from the electromagnetic fields generated by a small television, a cooker, a bar heater and a radio, all ranged along the back wall of a cordonned-off, semi-darkened space. The TV picture is a red fizz and the radio is tuned into a gulf between stations. This is an installation by Swedish artist Carl Michael von Hausswolff, in the exhibition Audible Light, at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford. Audible Light is about sound, light and sculpture, and includes artists from Britain, Scandinavia, Belgium and Germany. </p> <p>\"Hmmnn\" goes Hausswolff's work, and I go \"Hmm\", not knowing what to make of it. The title doesn't help me: Domestic Audiction Suggesting a Constant Flux of Semi-Individuals to be Detected - a sort of boffin's plodding variant on an old Damien Hirst title. The work generates the sort of sound the Aphex Twin might twiddle with on a hardcore ambient recording. Is this future disco? This morning I played all 70 tracks on the CD Trace, a compilation of two-minute sound works, a belatedly released part of last year's Liverpool Biennial. It included a man talking to himself near a spore of bear shit in the Canadian woods, and the sound of Yoko Ono doing something in her bathroom. There was lots of dweebling, and the odd gem. The 71st work on the CD I created myself, using the fast forward button. </p> <p>An alarm went off as I walked through the next gallery at Moma, competing with the bells already ringing in my head. The source of the clamour, a red industrial alarm, is sealed off behind glass in a tall, shiny aluminium cabinet, a sort of sentry box standing in the middle of the room. A sensor detects you as you move in close and a bell sounds. </p> <p>The point of this work, surely, is to outwit the alarm. I tried going round the cabinet in a low crouch, like Groucho Marx. I tried sidling to one side, but it caught me out. I almost tried crawling, but this was an interaction too far. Bruce Gilbert and Edward Graham Lewis, authors of Alarm (did it really take two people to think this up?), are members of the experimental punk group Wire. Alarm is terribly slight, an ambient interruption on your way through the gallery. I wanted it to be louder, scarier, more forceful and jarring. I wanted the earth to move for me. </p> <p>For that, I had to stand in Carsten Nicolai's installation. Pressure waves bent my ears; sound rumbled through my feet and my stomach. Nicolai has inset eight loudspeakers flush with a false grey floor and through them comes a low, juddering oscillation. It is a room filled with thunderous heavy breathing. Two spherical flagons half filled with water sit on the floor, doing their own reciprocal vibration. I guess they are body surrogates. You start to oscillate along with everything else in the room. I reeled out, shudder-ing. Oddly, the work made me want to pee, but I don't think that was the point. </p> <p>The most accomplished work here is Danish artist Ann Lislegaard's In Another Room. A blank white wall cuts across a darkened space, at an angle. There are speakers inset in each corner of the wall and a powerful halogen lamp blasts a bright smear of light on the middle of it. The light flares on and off, sometimes brighter, sometimes dimmer, faster and slower, in tandem with the sound of someone moving around in an apartment - footsteps on a wooden floor, furniture scraping, an office chair being wheeled from room to room. A female voice describes the action. </p> <p>The narrator tells us that the man in the room is looking out of his window. He goes through papers on his desk. He listens to his answering machine. He trundles his chair about, he sits and reads. We are told that the light is falling, day turning into night. The voice of the one who watches him sometimes overlays itself, incomprehensibly. The white of the wall where we watch is the same white as the walls in the room we cannot see. I hear the man in the room and I know that it is growing dark outside and that, as he looks through his window, he sees trees and a dog. </p> <p>I see real light flaring painfully on the wall in front of me, burning on to my retina. I have to turn away after a while, and I see in my mind's eye the room he inhabits. I imagine his furniture and his solitary maunderings. This is, of course, a bit like listening to a radio play, with sound effects, but the work also does something to the physical space of the gallery, turning it into a space for the imaginary. </p> <p>Finnish artists Tommi Gr\u00f6nlund have wired up the biggest space at Moma, with eight interconnected, wall-mounted parabolic reflectors. They look like satellite dishes. Cables snake into the centre of the room, plugged into two reel-to-reel tape recorders, each with a turning loop of tape. The effect is to turn the space into a whispering gallery. You hear yourself and others in the space relayed back, with a slight but perceptible delay. Stand near one of the reflectors and you hear the mutterings of people on the far side of the space, and their echoing, out-of-synch footfalls. </p> <p>One annoying character insisted on playing the various ring options on his mobile phone into one of the reflectors while I was there, reminding me of Gerard Hoffnung's anarchic advice to tourists - to try the famous echo in the British Museum reading room. Walking around in the space, you come across pockets of reflected sound and dead spots. The gallery feels enlarged and the reflectors look kind of pretty. </p> <p>I gather that Ann Veronica Janssens's installation Cyberlight is rather beautiful, too, but someone at the show's opening on Saturday night tampered with it, and it wasn't working on my visit. Janssens filled the Belgian pavilion at last year's Venice Biennale with a thick fog of dry ice, which created a minor stir. This new work is essentially a light installation, the only sound being the whirr of its \"cyberlight\" projector - included as aural accompaniment to the still images on Moma's PC-friendly Audible Light CD-Rom. It whirrs, helpfully. </p> <p>\u0095 Audible Light is at the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford (01865 722733), till March 19.</p>",

      "body": "<p>London has some of the worst public art in the world. Eduardo Paolozzi's robot heads, a mouldy Oscar Wilde emerging from his crypt... Recently that has started to change. A few adventurous initiatives have led to all kinds of ambitious contemporary artworks appearing in London's streets and squares. Surely the strangest of these is the sign that Adam Chodzko has planted in a shopping centre car park off the Finchley Road, with its double in the Arizona desert. </p> <p>Public art sounds like it ought to be useful. Adam Chodzko, an artist who works like an anthropologist tapping into collective cultural fantasies in projects such as a reunion for extras in Ken Russell's The Devils and, most famously, The God Lookalike Contest, has translated that ambition into the most down-to-earth and quintessentially urban conversation: the ritual giving of street directions. Giving directions is a transaction that can take place between absolute strangers or intimate friends, and the A-Z is the one text that unites our hugely disparate capital. So there's something cosy and recognisable about the big blue sign topped by a wind chime that stands in the car park of the O2 shopping centre. It offers detailed directions; the only thing is they're about how to find your way around Arizona. </p> <p>\"From Flagstaff, Arizona, take route 89 east, then route 510 east, then 505 north-east for 7 miles until you reach a left turn soon after passing Maroon Crater,\" advises the sign off Finchley Road. \"Half a mile beyond a small well, take a track that leads past little Roden spring_\" If you were to fly to Flagstaff and follow the signs, you would eventually find, near a rough cinder track at a point overlooking the Roden Crater and the pink rocks of the Painted Desert, another sign. </p> <p>There's a photograph in the shopping centre's lobby of the sharp, scorched desert grass and empty sky of Arizona. There, in the middle of nowhere, is a sign giving detailed London street directions. \"Heading north out of London along the west side of Regent's Park is the Finchley Road (A41). Follow it through St John's Wood and half a mile beyond to Swiss Cottage...\" </p> <p>If your head is reeling, imagine trying to explain this to the management of O2 who have allowed it to be installed until August as part of North London Link, a community art initiative by Camden Arts Centre. The humour of Chodzko's sign grows when you enter the building. This is a full-on American mall transplanted to north London, a place that claims to transport the shopper to another reality. O2 has fibreglass rocky outcrops all over the place, brown encrustations you can sit on to eat a lunchtime sandwich, a vast central mountain whose parched heights you can reach by escalator and, between the mountains, live fish. Giant tropical fish tanks bubble and shimmer and rare species flutter by. Reflected in the water, the mall is green and wobbly. </p> <p>When Adam Chodzko was invited to make a public artwork here, you can see he might have blanched: you can't really compete with O2 - it has a surrealism all its own. So his sign is an interpretation of what is already here. The mall is US culture transplanted to London and so, in a very different way, is Chodzko's sign. Because he is not giving Londoners directions to nowhere. Its twin stands within eyeshot of the Roden Crater, an extinct volcano where, for more than 25 years, the American light and space artist James Turrell has been creating a vast and beautiful installation. In the late 60s, artists such as Turrell and Robert Smithson, creator of the legendary Spiral Jetty in Salt Lake, Utah, set out to create art which couldn't be contained in the urban commercial art world, but had to be searched for - with difficulty. That's what Chodzko is doing with his sign. </p> <p>If you went out to the desert, you would find something strange and wonderful: an American artwork situated inside a volcano, something unique. And if you followed the sign from Arizona to London? \"Keep Holy Trinity Church and the Laser Eye Clinic to your right,\" says the sign in the desert, \"and Finchley Road Underground Station to your left. Then take a left turn, following the graceful curvature of the prodigious concrete and glass O2 building...\" </p> <p> E ach text ends with the revelation that, when you reach your destination in Arizona or north London \"here, in this place, is a sign which describes the location of this sign you have just finished reading\". Chodzko hypothesises a fold in space, a wormhole in the universe. When you stand in the car park and read his sign you can imagine for a moment that two remote places have become one, that the thin slice of air cut by the placard really is a gate to transport you instantly to Arizona. The wind chime heightens that feeling; it jangles to a distant movement. Like a story by Borges, the narrative of street directions takes us into another dimension. London in the middle of the desert, the desert in the middle of London. </p> <p>The magic works both ways. Better Scenery, the title of the artwork, is what is written at the top of each text. We may dream of Arizona, but if you were used to the desert, it might be magical to come across a signpost to distant places called St John's Wood and Swiss Cottage. In fact, in Chodzko's directions, London appears as a pastoral fantasy of woods, cottages, Regent's Park. Chodzko has explored the fantasy of pastoral before: in 1995 he placed an advert in a sex contacts magazine which consisted of a drawing of a woodland with the invitation \"Please will you join me here?\". Better Scenery is what art has offered ever since the ancient Romans had rustic idylls painted on their walls, and pastoral retreat is one of the great fantasies of painting from Titian to Watteau. Chodzko's public artwork offers a modern pastoral hidden under the surface of everyday life, a mysterious fantasy world located somewhere between the Roden Crater and Finchley Road tube station.</p> <p>\u0095 Adam Chodzko, Better Scenery, car park and lower lobby, O2, 255 Finchley Road, London NW3 (information: 0171-431 8767) till August 27.</p>",

We may dream of Arizona, but if you were used to the desert, it might be magical to come across a signpost to distant places called St John's Wood and Swiss Cottage. In fact, in Chodzko's directions, London appears as a pastoral fantasy of woods, cottages, Regent's Park. Chodzko has explored the fantasy of pastoral before: in 1995 he placed an advert in a sex contacts magazine which consisted of a drawing of a woodland with the invitation \"Please will you join me here?\". Better Scenery is what art has offered ever since the ancient Romans had rustic idylls painted on their walls, and pastoral retreat is one of the great fantasies of painting from Titian to Watteau. Chodzko's public artwork offers a modern pastoral hidden under the surface of everyday life, a mysterious fantasy world located somewhere between the Roden Crater and Finchley Road tube station. \u0095 Adam Chodzko, Better Scenery, car park and lower lobby, O2, 255 Finchley Road, London NW3 (information: 0171-431 8767) till August 27.",

Schering-Plough was set to develop and commercialise marimastat and a second product BB-3644.</p> <p>The failure backs up scepticism expressed by its former head of clinical research, Dr Andrew Millar, who was fired after talking to company shareholders about his concerns.</p> <p>Dr Millar was worried that British Biotech's share price was flying high on the back of unreasonable expectations about the company's key drugs zacutex - a treatment for pancreatitis - and marimastat. He claimed that marimastat had only a 40% chance of success and his scepticism now appears well-founded.</p> <p>But City analysts said despite the setback they had not given up all hope on marimastat and hoped that further trials could be more successful. One said he remained optimistic about the company: \"It (marimastat) was always a bit of a wild card option. Today's news is bad news but it has not really changed the fundamentals.\" But the share price fall showed overall City confidence in British Biotech was seriously dented.</p>",

British Biotech has been struggling to re-establish itself as a serious industry player since a series of scandals 18 months ago led to the exit of its founder Keith McCullagh and the collapse of shares which once traded at \u00a33. But the vital 'phase 3' trials failed to show that marimastat helped in cases of advanced pancreatic cancer and new chief executive Elliot Goldstein admitted: \"The negative results from this trial are disappointing.\" The poor results on Study 193 are the first to be unveiled since British Biotech entered into collaberation with Schering-Plough Corp to develop a matrix of metalloproteinase inhibitors for cancer. The collaberation is set to continue and patients treated with marimastat at less advanced stages of cancer did respond better. Schering-Plough was set to develop and commercialise marimastat and a second product BB-3644. The failure backs up scepticism expressed by its former head of clinical research, Dr Andrew Millar, who was fired after talking to company shareholders about his concerns. Dr Millar was worried that British Biotech's share price was flying high on the back of unreasonable expectations about the company's key drugs zacutex - a treatment for pancreatitis - and marimastat. He claimed that marimastat had only a 40% chance of success and his scepticism now appears well-founded. But City analysts said despite the setback they had not given up all hope on marimastat and hoped that further trials could be more successful. One said he remained optimistic about the company: \"It (marimastat) was always a bit of a wild card option. Today's news is bad news but it has not really changed the fundamentals.\" But the share price fall showed overall City confidence in British Biotech was seriously dented.",

But industry watchers are convinced that the British company will refuse to back down, especially as previous offers to divest assets were dismissed as insufficient. Fadel Gheit, analyst with New York broker Fahnestock &amp; Co, said: \"This has become a political issue caught up with the presidential elections. \"The FTC wants to be seen to be getting tough but there are no economic or factual reasons for turning down the deal.\" The analyst believes BP Amoco's chairman, Sir John Browne, is ready to play hard ball in the courts and long-term investors remain confident that he will win, leading to little movement in the company's share price. BP Amoco closed up 10p at 574p helped by developments yesterday in Russia. These delivered good news for the company's $1bn investment there, which was all but safeguarded when creditors agreed to support a rescue plan for a bankrupt local oil group, Sidanko, in which BP Amoco holds a 10% stake. The British company, one of Russia's largest foreign investors, had threatened to pull out of the country over the way the collapse of Sidanko in May last year had been treated by the courts. The case was seen a test for future investment in Russia by western companies. Howard Chase, a BP Amoco spokesman, said the restruc turing - the first of its kind for a leading Russian industrial company - was an encouraging sign for the country's oil sector although it must still be endorsed by a Moscow court on Friday. \"We are hopeful that the court will approve the deal.

The news emerged despite denials by HKT's chief executive, Linus Cheung, last week that the firm may soon be split from its British parent. A C&amp;W spokesman, meanwhile, insisted that the potential merger would leave the British company vulnerable to predators such as Bell South and SBC Ameritech of the United States, or Deutsche Telekom in Europe. He said a merger of HKT and SingTel was part of C&amp;W's transformation into a global provider of internet services. \"In terms of our strategic view it would free up resources to focus on data and IT businesses,\" he said. Steve Trowbridge, analyst at Teather &amp; Greenwood, said the transfer of HKT into a joint holding company could allow C&amp;W to realise the value of its investment in the Hong Kong business which has not been reflected in the share price. HKT accounts for almost 60% of C&amp;W's operating profit. However, HKT reported a surprise loss of about $356m (\u00a3215.7m) in the six months to September 30. \"It's Graham Wallace's strategy to unlock value, as the company has always traded at a discount to the the sum of its parts,\" Mr Trowbridge said. In a series of rapid-fire deals C&amp;W's chief executive Graham Wallace has sold a string of non-core assets - most notably the sale of the One2One mobile telephone business for \u00a38.4bn to Deutsche Telekom last year. Last week the group an nounced that in pursuit of its new strategy it is spending almost \u00a3500m snapping up 11 internet business service providers in Europe. The new Asian telecoms group created from HKT and SingTel would have a combined market capitalisation of \u00a337bn, revenues of \u00a34.5bn and net cash of \u00a33.5bn, according to analysts. The City expects full terms to be agreed by the end of March, although as yet the structure remains uncertain. It would require government and regulatory approval. The Chinese government also owns 7% of HKT, but it is understood that it has been kept informed of the discussions and is likely to be supportive of the deal. If C&amp;W took an entire equity stake in the combined group it would end up with a 27% holding - with observers noting that this would be considered to be a much more liquid investment than the existing structure of the group. The likelihood, however, is that shareholders in both companies will be offered a combination of cash and shares. A merged group would be listed in the stock exchanges in Hong Kong, Singapore, New York and possibly also London. Last week Singapore announced that it would speed up the opening up of its telecoms sector to boost its ambitions to be a regional hub for that market.

Europe's share of technology deals globally more than doubled from 16.5% in 1998 to an unprecedented 38% during 1999. The value of European technology deals added up to more than all the other years of the decade put together.

In total there were a record 2,271 deals across the information technology, communications and media industries last year, up from 1,782 in 1998. Victor Basta, the head of European operations at Broadview, the investment bank which published the research yesterday, said that part of last year's record-breaking increase reflected the fact that Europe felt a need to catch up with the United States, where technology deals have led the takeover boom for longer. The deals are also driven by the strategic demands of the internet as large European ca ble and telecommunications groups fight to provide access to the web. Among last year's ground-breaking deals were Vodafone's hostile bid for Mannesmann of Germany and Telecom Italia-Olivetti takeover. Mr Basta believes that if the first hostile bid for a German group by a non-domestic company is successful it could result in a wave of copycat deals across Europe. \"We will see the barriers coming down if this deal is successful,\" he said. Few bankers are predicting a slowing in the number of mergers and acquisitions this year - especially after America Online started the year off with the world's largest takeover attempt by bidding for Time Warner. Mr Basta forecast a \"European version of the AOL-Time Warner deal between a European media group and a European online business\" over the coming year. Technology deals around the world more than doubled last year, from $474bn to $1,200bn in 1999 as consolidation in the cable, telecoms and media industries increased. Many of the deals have been predicated by groups vying to provide broadband access, which offers faster data transmission across all networks, including the internet.

The whole thing was much more intense than usual. Alsop, taking it slowly, emphasises brooding orchestral colours that you don't normally notice. Van Keulen, subordinating flamboyance to drama and employing a velvety-rich, sensual tone throughout, really lets the music live, breathe and sing. </p> <p>Alsop also showed her prowess in works by Brahms and Tchaikovsky, with varying impact. Tchaikovsky's Hamlet is a peculiar piece which has less to do with Shakespeare than with the composer's own tendency to depression. It shirks the play's Oedipal implications, jettisoning Claudius, Gertrude and Polonius altogether and focusing on Hamlet's tormented psyche, interwoven with portraits of his spectral papa, Ophelia and, oddly, Fortinbras. Alsop pitches it a fraction too high, opening in an atmosphere of such near-hysteria that she comes dangerously close, in places, to going over the top. On the other hand, there are fabulously unnerving insights. The way she stresses the grotesque twisting of Ophelia's theme as her image distorts in Hamlet's mind was particularly telling. </p> <p>No qualms about Alsop's Brahms, though. She got the balance of elements in his First Symphony absolutely right, instilling a remarkable cogency and homogeneity of mood into a work which can sometimes seem an episodic collection of movements rather than an integrated whole.

But he takes the argument a stage further by suggesting that the greatest penalty is to end up permanently hitched to your secret partner. The real winner may be the person who, rather like Feydeau himself, ends up fancy-free. But what gives his farce a touch of genius is its surreal inventiveness. In other Feydeau plays we have a man who mislays his false palate and another who stammers violently during thunderstorms.
