We deduce that Richard, a doctor, and his wife, Corinne, have moved to the country to start a new life.

Corinne's suspicions, like ours, are instantly aroused: Richard's old drug-habit, his failure to visit a dying patient, the needles in the girl's handbag all become vital pieces of evidence in a tale fraught with deception. </p> <p>In the past Crimp's plays have attacked urban consumerism. Here he widens his vision to suggest that country life is now filled with transplanted bourgeois desperation. Richard's unseen doctor partner constantly quotes The Georgics; what we get from Crimp is a Pinterish philippic about corrosive deceit and delusion. It works because Crimp artfully withholds information to generate suspense and subtly plays with verbal leitmotifs: the word \"track\", for instance, constantly recurs, implying both a rural byway and the marks left by a mainlining addict. </p> <p>The Pinter parallel is reinforced by the use of language as a mask. When Corinne meets Rebecca, the unexpected guest, their encounter is fraught with a semantic nit-picking that conceals mutual hostility: as Rebecca shrewdly remarks, \"The more you talk, the less you say.\" And the last scene between husband and wife is an elaborate verbal dance in which a truth suddenly spoken comes like a blow in the face. </p> <p>Katie Mitchell's production has the fevered intensity she normally reserves for the classics. Juliet Stevenson's excellent Corinne displays the edginess of someone tiptoeing over eggshells, while Owen Teale as the doctor has the nervous bonhomie of the practised liar and Indira Varma as Rebecca radiates a tetchy sensuality.

He also held out some hope of compensation for investors who feel they lost out on April 5, the last day of the tax year when the exchange opened almost eight hours late as a result of a technical breakdown. Under fire for issuing a statement stressing the \"aim\" of the merger with the Deutsche B\u00f6rse was to create trading in euros, Mr Cruickshank was forced to admit that \"syntax\" had caused some confusion. The exchange countered concerns that small investors and major pension funds would be forced to buy UK shares in euros but admitted that shares could be quoted in both sterling and euros. During an often ill-tempered exchange with the MPs, Martin Wheatley, the director of business development, insisted that even if the main listing of a UK firm were no longer in sterling, the exchange would ensure prices in sterling were still available for private investors, newspapers and the calculation of indices. Mr Cruickshank insisted that any suggestions that the stock exchange had an agenda to encourage the introduction of the euro was an \"extraordinarily selective interpretation\" of the exchange's attitude. It would be left to the companies which listed their shares on the market and the investors who bought their shares to decide in which currency they would be traded. In an attempt to lessen MP's anxieties, the exchange said that less than 1% of UK shares had been traded in euros. After the \"disruption and inconvenience\" of the shutdown on April 5, the exchange admitted yesterday that it had taken steps to improve reliability for the future after a report approved by the financial services authority.",

But Major's love and knowledge of the game are deep and genuine, as those of us who witnessed his speech at the Bedser twins' 80th birthday bash will testify. </p> <p>Beside Lord Home, however, Major was a duffer at cricket. In 1924, as Lord Dunglass, Home made his debut for Middlesex and in 1963 he became the first prime minister with a first-class record. He played 10 matches, scoring 147 runs at 16.33 and taking 12 wickets at 30. He also toured South Africa with an MCC side in 1926-27. </p> <p>Lord Home of the Hirsel, however, was possibly not the finest cricketer to hole up at No10.

He was 73 when, as captain of Lords and Commons, he saved the match against MCC by batting for an hour. </p> <p>Here too is the 5ft 6in George Osbaldeston, known as the Squire of England, steeplechaser, shot (98 pheasants from 100 shots), pugilist, fisherman and cricketer. Osbaldeston represented East Retford for the Liberals from 1812-18 before he gave up Parliament for cricket and became one of the fastest underarm bowlers and most powerful hitters of his day. </p> <p>A keen gambler, he once took a wager that he could cover 200 miles in 10 hours. Using a fresh horse every four miles he did so with 78 minutes to spare. </p> <p>Short of temper as well as inches, he was involved in a duel at Wormwood Scrubs in which he and his adversary both missed their targets. </p> <p>One of the most famous politicians in whites was the third Baron Tennyson, Lionel, grandson of the Poet Laureate. Wounded twice while serving with the Rifle Brigade in the first world war, he went on to captain Hampshire and England with some panache. </p> <p>Once, while captaining Hampshire, the umpires objected to him shouting to his batsmen at the crease. So he sent instructions by telegram, with the post office messenger boy carrying the envelope out to the wicket. </p> <p> Lord Tennyson retained the Hampshire wicketkeeper Walter Livsey as his supernumerary in the winter. One dark evening Livsey arrived at the wicket where Tennyson wanted stumps pulled for the day. \"What do you think about the light?\" he boomed. Livsey replied: \"I can hear you, milord, but I can't see you.\" </p> <p>Then there was Aidan Crawley, fighter pilot, escaped PoW and documentary film-maker, who played for Oxford, Kent and the Free Foresters. He played for different teams in Parliament too, representing both Labour and the Conservatives. </p> <p>There is clearly a message in all this. If Tony Blair really intends to win back the hearts of the nation he should hire spinners in place of spin doctors and batsmen in place of whips.</p>",

He was 73 when, as captain of Lords and Commons, he saved the match against MCC by batting for an hour. Here too is the 5ft 6in George Osbaldeston, known as the Squire of England, steeplechaser, shot (98 pheasants from 100 shots), pugilist, fisherman and cricketer. Osbaldeston represented East Retford for the Liberals from 1812-18 before he gave up Parliament for cricket and became one of the fastest underarm bowlers and most powerful hitters of his day. A keen gambler, he once took a wager that he could cover 200 miles in 10 hours. Using a fresh horse every four miles he did so with 78 minutes to spare. Short of temper as well as inches, he was involved in a duel at Wormwood Scrubs in which he and his adversary both missed their targets. One of the most famous politicians in whites was the third Baron Tennyson, Lionel, grandson of the Poet Laureate. Wounded twice while serving with the Rifle Brigade in the first world war, he went on to captain Hampshire and England with some panache. Once, while captaining Hampshire, the umpires objected to him shouting to his batsmen at the crease. So he sent instructions by telegram, with the post office messenger boy carrying the envelope out to the wicket. Lord Tennyson retained the Hampshire wicketkeeper Walter Livsey as his supernumerary in the winter. One dark evening Livsey arrived at the wicket where Tennyson wanted stumps pulled for the day. \"What do you think about the light?\" he boomed. Livsey replied: \"I can hear you, milord, but I can't see you.\" Then there was Aidan Crawley, fighter pilot, escaped PoW and documentary film-maker, who played for Oxford, Kent and the Free Foresters. He played for different teams in Parliament too, representing both Labour and the Conservatives. There is clearly a message in all this. If Tony Blair really intends to win back the hearts of the nation he should hire spinners in place of spin doctors and batsmen in place of whips.",

He has already turned down one opportunity in London for serious tuition. Now, he whispers, there is possible scope for a new future for that tenor voice of his. Could that mean the end of his test cricket, something which would be a minor disaster for his emerging country? He responds enigmatically: \"In an ideal world I'd love the two careers to be concurrent.\" </p> <p>There is nothing ideal about the lurching economy back home or the farm invasions that dominate the headlines and nag at the consciences of Zimbabwe's players. The team manager Dan Stannard, a former police officer, says: \"Our policy is to do our best to concentrate on the cricket and leave others to handle the politics.\" </p> <p>Olonga, wise and sensitive beyond his 23 years, says: \"We've all got a personal interest in what is happening in Zimbabwe. I think daily of my parents, family, girlfriend, everyone ... The guys must be worried. But it should not distract us from the way we perform. We are professionals, after all.\" </p> <p>As the first black Zimbabwean to play for his country, Olonga is conscious of his responsibilities as a role model. He will stand up to speak at a church meeting as fluently as he does when someone engages him in the arts. </p> <p>That Test debut, against Pakistan five years ago, was a demoralising experience. He was no-balled for throwing, some feared into oblivion. But with the help of Dennis Lillee he reinvented his action. At times he remained wayward, driving his captains to distraction about when to risk him, but he could also produce the occasional ball of exquisite length and unplayable intent. He was, and still is, the speed merchant who could turn a game on its head - as he did with his six for 19 against England in Cape Town in January. </p> <p>In a team of limited resources and modest budgets for the players, Olonga is typically accessible. There are few obvious egos; too many of the party are currently bereft of confidence in any case. Dave Houghton, their paternal coach, has temporarily left for the more affluent territories of satellite television. The dressing room is regrouping, with Andy Pycroft the new coach. </p> <p>\"There are some new ideas,\" says Olonga. \"We've got a new boss and you can sense signs of excitement. We're a happy dressing room.\" </p> <p>Stannard, who is strong on diplomacy, describes his squad as \"racially well integrated\". The introduction of talented black players is in no way cosmetic. Pommie Mbangwa is there on merit, another amiable young man whose lack of sheer pace is compensated for by his attractive action and the precision you would expect of an older test campaigner. </p> <p>The diminutive Tatenda Taibu kept wicket against Hampshire at Southampton as if it were a form match at home. He turned 17 on Sunday and is still at school. Seldom can a player at this level have appeared so boyish in appearance. The matronly regulars on the boundary at Northlands Road must have wanted to mother him. In truth he proved, with a performance of quiet, flawless efficiency, that he could look after himself. </p> <p>Zimbabwe are an engaging rather than intimidating team. Their bowling is mostly medium-paced, or just over, though Mbangwa and Neil Johnson appear none the worse for that. The team chase eagerly in the field, as if striving to enhance their uncertain status. They don't smile a lot but are personable and want to be taken more seriously. </p> <p>The strike bowler Heath Streak, with 120 wickets from 29 tests, is vital to their prospects in the first test at Lord's starting tomorrow. He has struggled of late with a knee injury but, as a farmer, that is far from his only worry these days. </p> <p>\"When he was unfit it meant a more senior bowling role for me,\" says Olonga. \"I've bowled a lot in the last three months and I think it's probably taken its toll. If anything I've slowed down a little, trying to be more accurate, searching for control as well as pace. Once or twice I've surprised myself by swinging the ball both ways.\" </p> <p>And this from an exultant match-winner who, after his sensational three wickets in five balls to beat India by three runs in the World Cup at Grace Road last year, told this reporter: \"I've never been length-and-line, you know. They tell me speed is my forte. If I land the ball in the right place then there's a chance of something happening.\" </p> <p>Olonga's singing range stretches from opera to R&amp;B and soul. \"I like it all and don't know yet which style I'll adopt.\" That is another facet of his versatility.

      "bodyText": "The Premiership's popularity remains on the up, with figures published yesterday showing an increase in attendances for the eighth season in a row. The average crowd was 30,703 and the total number of fans was 11.7m, an increase of 0.4%. The most significant gains were made by Bradford and Watford, whose promotion from the First Division led to rises in gates of 26% and 56% respectively. Aston Villa were the main exception to the upsurge, with crowds at Villa Park falling by 14%, but Manchester United's average of 58,017 at Old Trafford meant they totalled more than one million fans for Premiership games. United's Roy Keane and Gary Kelly of Leeds have been ruled out of the Republic of Ireland's summer matches against Scotland, Mexico, the United States and South Africa with hamstring injuries. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has been put up for sale by Atletico Madrid. The striker, who left Leeds for \u00a312m last summer, scored 24 goals despite Atletico's relegation and has been linked with a move back to the Premiership. Real Betis, who also dropped out of La Liga, are looking to sell the Brazilian Denilson, who cost them \u00a322m, a world-record fee in 1997.",

Then we have to imagine what it would be like to live in a world of people who have no wish to help each other or to feel better. If we don't do this, the history of medicine, and of its country cousin psychiatry, not to mention the history of religion, will hardly seem different from a history of quacks and con-artists ingeniously exploiting the hopelessly vulnerable.

Only when we acknowledge the very real drawbacks of living in a world in which everyone's unhappiness renders everyone else clueless, can we review our contemporary options and their histories with some sense of relief.

Our misgivings about the available treatments for our contemporary miseries too easily turns into a cover-story for an intolerance of, or impatience with, suffering itself. Scepticism about treatments becomes suspicion about patients (if the treatment is fraudulent, and it works, then the condition it was nominally treating must be fraudulent too: so everyone's a fool). The contesting of cures, if it does nothing else, keeps the idea of cure alive; but it tends to make people in the so-called helping professions excessively judgmental of each other (i.e. rivalrous).

Part of the fascination (so to speak) of mesmerism and hypnosis - and of the history that is so well told in Svengali's Web - is that, as potential cures for a wide range of miseries, they were so quickly seen to be at once remarkable breakthroughs, and disreputable, if not criminal activities. It was not clear whether (like the psychoanalysis that was born of this tradition) they were solutions, or problems in themselves, or both. Indeed for some people, the fact that these forms of treatment helped the patient was itself the patient's most serious and revealing symptom; and what it revealed was the patient's pathological naivety. People were not being cured through hypnosis, the critics said, they were suffering from being hypnotisable: what they really needed to be cured of was their susceptibility to certain cures. These new treatments, in other words, had ironically disclosed what some feared might be the most terrible, perhaps the most constitutively human problem of all: that people could have considerable influence over each other. That bodies affected each other in daunting and undreamt of ways; that eyes and voices and hands - among other body-parts - were essentially rhetorical organs.</p> <p>Both as a theatrical spectacle and as a medical treatment, hypnotism made it clear that bodies were persuasive, and that the appetite for persuasion and for being persuaded was exorbitant. It may seem odd, in retrospect, that this should have seemed so shocking. Christianity, after all, was an extravagant acknowledgment of the power of the body; and sexuality, through its various historical formations and deformations, has always been spoken of as a fascination (sex, too, has a reputation for being the problem and the solution). But what the hypnotist exposed, perhaps most devastatingly in such a progressive age as the 19th century, was just how lowbrow people really were. It wasn't truth or goodness they were after: they wanted to be moved. And it wasn't exactly the other person's logic, or their argument, or the information they provided or even their education that was convincing, so much as the look in their eye or their smile. As many commentators - then as now - were quick to point out, this makes politics more volatile than some want it to be, and science much less influential than some think it should be.</p> <p>The hypnotist and his subject were like a tableau, or a model, of something fundamental and disturbing about human nature. If we are sensual but not that sensible - if we only feel and are barely rational - then hypnotism is not much more than another word for human relations. The question was no longer, could hypnotism be disproved (and therefore discredited), but what was the alternative? What did people do together that wasn't hypnotism, or horribly akin to it? If politics, religion and sexual relations couldn't easily exempt themselves from such a dismaying comparison, why should medicine be able to? Hypnotism was like a terrible cartoon - a secular revelation - of the power people could have over each other, of the enthralled longing to be free from choice. Seeing the amazing things bodies could do to each other - witnessing just how manipulable people's limbs and memories were - made hypnotism as a phenomenon endlessly fascinating, if not actually hypnotic. Since the turn of the last century it has been assumed, or hoped, that a combination of science and history might break its spell. In its sober speculation, and its wealth of often fascinating research, Svengali's Web is in this honourable, but somehow forlorn tradition of lucid and intelligible enquiry into unfathomable craziness.</p> <p>It is the contention of Pick's book that Du Maurier's once extremely famous novel, Trilby, with its evil, hypnotising Jew, Svengali, was a sensation waiting to happen; and that we have to go back to the beginnings of mesmerism in the 18th century, and forward to the advent of psychoanalysis at the turn of the last century, to understand why. The ground, as Pick shows in impressive detail, had been cleared - or rather, given the many theatrical adaptations of Trilby, the stage had been set - for this particular bestseller. Wittingly or unwittingly, Du Maurier had tuned into the spirit of the age, and turned up the volume. Trilby, as Pick says, \"is generally thought to have been the bestselling novel of the last century\"; and this alone makes it, for better and for worse, what used to be called a \"symptomatic text\": a way into the multiple overlapping histories of race and gender and science and pseudo-science in the 19th century. Svengali's Web, in other words, is topical by academic standards; and is, in its turn, something of a symptomatic text itself.</p> <p>What Pick uses cultural history to do is integral to his subject. And one of the things he uses it for is to promote a not unfamiliar progress myth - it was more or less Freud's own myth and so became, more or less, the official line - in which the follies of mesmerism and hypnosis are displaced by the stronger rationality of psychoanalysis. When Freud abrogates hypnosis as a therapeutic technique, psychoanalysis is born, and the 19th century begins to see sense where previously there had only been the hocus-pocus of suggestion. In Freud's writing, Pick intimates, meaning is finally derived from all the bewildering psychopathology of everyday life. \"Freud,\" he writes, \"was soon to conceptualise much of the psychic terrain and unspeakable desires to which other writers of the period seemed to be vaguely alluding\u00c4 Such a vocabulary remained out of reach for Du Maurier.\" But because Pick insists that Trilby is a very poor novel, and that psychoanalysis was (and is) a great clarification, because he is curiously snobbish about 'popular culture', and needlessly defensive of psychoanalysis, nuances are lost in what is otherwise a very engaging book.</p> <p>\"Psychoanalysis,\" Pick writes, \"is painted by its critics as a historical monolith, entirely unreconstructed since its inception, as though Freud was Svengali and the entire movement his helpless Trilby.\" But this is to take a monolithic view of the critics. Proving that Freud was not Svengali is less promising than wondering why (and whether) this needs to be disproved. And the best critics of psychoanalysis are rather more interesting than Pick suggests, pointing out, as some of them do, that there are many ways of hypnotising people - saying very little and sitting out of sight is one - and that Freud's so-called movement has been rather more of a cult than his followers have been prepared to admit. The interesting question is what is it about psychoanalysis that stops it being a form of hypnosis? Pick uses Trilby to answer this question, or at least to go some way towards doing so, making the whole issue into a kind of contest between the vulgar and the more refined, between the entertainers and the better educated. \"All of Du Maurier's novels,\" Pick writes, \"to say nothing of the spoofs and speculations which followed, epitomised a maudlin and melodramatic style of the day that many grander critics and philosophers despised. Yet in the figure of the exploitative, beguiling conductor and his touching victim, Du Maurier had hit on a curiously resonant symbol.\" Svengali's Web is about how such a thing could have happened.</p> <p>Trilby, first published in 1894, is the story of Trilby O'Ferrall, whom we first meet as an artist's model, and friend of three bohemian British artists living and working in Paris. She has her own terrible history as the orphaned daughter of alcoholic parents. In flight from horrible memories she is - it soon becomes obvious - in desperate need of something; she has, the narrator tells us, \"a singularly impressionable nature, as was shown by her quick and ready susceptibility to Svengali's hypnotic influence\". Svengali, the archetypal alien enchanter of Pick's title, eases her pain, as well as facilitating a seemingly astonishing talent. In Henry James's well chosen words, Trilby is \"mesmerised and made to sing by a little foreign Jew who has mesmeric power, infinite feeling, and no organ (save as an accompanist) of his own\". It is a story about exploitation, possession and artistry, and very self-consciously of its time. It is a strange and artful book; and Du Maurier seems to me more archly attentive to what he is up to than Pick gives him credit for. When, for example, the narrator describes the talk of these young bohemian artists as not \"redolent of the very highest culture (which, by the way, can mar as well as make)\", Du Maurier is clearly drawing attention to the relationship between marring and making, and how this might figure in the art of his own book. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Du Maurier was a friend of James's and discussed the plot of Trilby with him, the novel is riddled with questions about high and low art. Pick's \"aim\", he says, \"has been to set out the available intellectual, cultural and political ingredients\" from which Du Maurier \"concocted so idiosyncratic and influential a recipe\". And although he achieves this, it is almost at the cost of any kind of close reading of the novel itself. In fact, one of the curious things about Svengali's Web is that Pick seems determined to persuade us that Trilby is not worth reading - except, that is, for the cultural history that a sufficiently informed reader can unpack from it.</p> <p>What makes Trilby such a bad book in Pick's eyes is its \"mawkishness as well as the insistent 'anti-high culture tone'\" - quite apart from the fact that \"Du Maurier was no Proust.\" For 'anti-high culture tone', I think we should read 'questions about high culture', and 'questions about what it might be to be anti-high culture'; if Trilby is alert to anything it is alert to what is done in the name of art and culture. And if we are still in any doubt about the novel's real worth, Pick assures us that \"Du Maurier certainly has some eminent detractors. The highly distinguished literary critic, Professor Frank Kermode, for example, finds precious little to admire in Du Maurier's writing.\" Perhaps Pick wants to protect us (and himself) from the blandishments of the book. One can't be fastidious enough with this novel. \"If the laboured pathos of the story now causes us to flinch,\" Pick writes - again underestimating Du Maurier's shrewd sense of genre \u0086 \"it should be remembered that many of Du Maurier's contemporaries were as deeply absorbed and affected by the novel's themes as they were keen to buy Trilby accessories.\" Using so-called popular culture as a pretext for highbrow commentary has its dangers, of course, the most obvious of which being that it makes the people who enjoy popular culture seem somehow deficient. By dividing the world into the informed and the uninformed - and especially when doing so with historical hindsight - cultural historians easily make themselves sound merely ahead of the game. Even though, as Pick himself points out, Svengali is finally exposed as a fraud, \"the enigma remained: how was one to explain Svengali and company's massive cultural appeal?\" Does that mean that fraudulence only exists in so far as it can be exposed? \"The tale had something extraordinary about it,\" Pick continues, \"a passion had been unleashed in excess of any evident logic, and for reasons that had little to do with literary merit.\" The idea of literary merit, like the idea of fraudulence, depends on surenesses of judgment that the author of Trilby, among others - and Freud was among those others - knew to be under pressure. At the height of his success with Trilby, Svengali showed just how precarious personal judgment is. Hypnotism makes a mockery of good taste. Which is another thing it might share with psychoanalysis.</p> <p>How can so many people - even 'intelligent' people - think bad things are good? the old fashioned intellectual cries. Or even worse, not care whether they are good or bad, but just want them? Pick seems keener to fight a rearguard action for literary merit than to want to rethink it. And this is strange because Svengali's Web is everywhere interested in, and interesting about, the threats to social cohesion posed by alien enchanters of various kinds, and about the implications of this for ideas about the making of a political or aesthetic consensus. If, as he says, \"the alien hypnotist also became a kind of conduit for a much wider contemporary unease concerning the nature of irrational social influences and psychological transmissions,\" then any kind of social rule, or standard, any attempt to set limits or draw boundaries, is under threat. And there could be no more vivid evidence of these irrational influences and transmissions than cultural fads and crazes and fashions, like Trilby itself. Then as now, the anguish aroused by hypnotism was that it revealed all too starkly the ways in which people could be enthused and impressed and persuaded - and even deranged and virtually (or literally) kidnapped - in spite of themselves. Our conscious choices, it suggested, may be as nothing compared with our unconscious (unknown beforehand) powers of discrimination. The problem for the newly emerging 19th-century democrat was that to disdain popularity was to disdain people. If culture wasn't popular, why should it be called culture? And yet the art of capturing the public imagination, as Pick makes abundantly clear, could seem like a very dark art indeed. It is not, of course, obvious why it would have been better - or indeed what the consequences might have been - if the passions unleashed by Trilby had been due to its literary merit rather than its supposed demerit. When Pick writes that \"those tempted to become involved in seances and to succumb to trances were in very good company indeed. Numerous writers, artists and scientists had plunged in at the deep end, not only as patients but as would-be practitioners,\" it is not evident who is being reassured about what. Did the presence of these writers and artists and scientists in some way legitimate these practices, or just show that these distinguished people were as seducible, as impressionable, as everyone else? After all, the thing about hypnotism and its paranormal spin-offs - indeed part of their fascination - was that they played havoc with apparently established hierarchies of class, gender and profession. Everyone, it seemed, was suggestible. Man, as he was then called, was the animal who wanted to seduce and be seduced.</p> <p>Science - in the form of psychology, anthropology, biology - was mobilised, as Pick shows, by mesmerism and hypnosis to explain what we now call seduction. But with the background fear - that has turned out to be largely justified - that explaining seduction might not make a difference to its prevalence or its power; that it may in fact just be another form that seduction can take (people could be usefully said to have been hypnotised by science, and so none the wiser). It's just possible that hypnotism is the best description we have so far come up with for what goes on between people, whether we are talking about parents and children, doctors and patients, or nations and their leaders. This, Pick implies, is what made Trilby take: not that Svengali was a fraud (the existence - and exposure - of fraudulence is itself taken to be proof that somewhere there is a genuine, trustworthy, reliable person), but that such essential distinctions may no longer hold, or that we are no longer interested in making them. The alien enchanter may be longed for as much as he is feared. And it is in writing about the Jew as alien enchanter - with Svengali as the modern prototype - that Pick's book is at its best.</p> <p>There were - and Pick quotes them well - many Victorian writers, of varying professions, who were keen to argue that \"the 'virtues and vices' of\u00c4 the Jews included special powers of psychic manipulation\"; and that they were \"especially prone to the sort of volatile emotional and hypnotic states in which deadly impulses are acted upon\". A Jew like Svengali, \"well-featured but sinister\", as Du Maurier describes him, a brilliant musician and a versatile linguist, at once redeeming and ruining a vulnerable gentile girl, couldn't avoid being a dramatic contribution to a topical debate. In both the popular press and the specialist medical journals, what Pick calls 'the figurative bond between mesmerism and the Jews' became increasingly prominent throughout the 19th century. In such widely read magazines as Punch, \"later Victorian Jews were often represented as 'Svengalian' - ingratiating, seductive, dangerously alluring\u00c4 not only as repulsive, but also as psychologically penetrating.\" What Pick demonstrates above all is the astonishing confusion that Jews evoked in the English. \"In the wider culture,\" he writes, \"they were often said to confound the gentile, to produce an intolerable bafflement.\" The bafflement, it seems, was largely about themselves. \"The repeated perception of the Jews as effective healers but also as potentially lethal magicians\" vied with what Pick calls \"the fear of the Jew's capacity to transform weakness into strength\". Whether they were regarded as \"highly equivocal figures, the bearers of poisons and remedies\", or whether the English couldn't tolerate their own deep-seated (if not actually enthroned) ambivalence, all Pick's documentation suggests that the Jews in England in the 19th century created a conflict in their hosts but not, fortunately, the dire intolerance found later and elsewhere. If Disraeli and Fagin and Svengali shared a certain caricature in England, as Pick suggests, it was chaotically uncertain of its own values.</p> <p>It has been the project of most anti-semites, and some of their critics, to make the Jews into a special case: chosen again either as uniquely fascinating or exceptionally depraved; unusually talented or uniquely scurrilous. What Pick manages to do in Svengali's Web is to place a great deal of primary source material on mostly British 19th century anti-semitism alongside a lucid overview of the more convincing theoretical attempts to make sense of what is, by any standards, bizarre and equivocal material. \"Loaded\", in Pick's words, \"with particularly paradoxical meanings\", the Jew seems in modern times to have been trailed by three legends about himself: that he wanders because he does - or doesn't - have a homeland; that he didn't accept Jesus, who went on to be the idol of the West, as a redeemer; and that compared with his contemporaries in the Bible, he has lasted a very long time (you don't meet many Hittites in European cities). In other words, it is the adaptiveness, the judgment, and the endurance of the Jews that has made them fascinating and suspect. Using Slavoj Zizek's work to ground his own conclusions, Pick suggests, along psychoanalytic lines, that \"Jews serve as a kind of 'lightning conductor' for unwanted parts of the self and for uncontainable social forces. But they also present a category problem\u00c4 they do not have a clear place and their homelessness itself is their defining feature. Jews become the emblem of the unrealisable nature of the idealised, unified human group, of the unachievable idyll of a fully harmonious social order.\" From this point of view, it seems that the Jews remind people of what Zizek calls, rather grandly, \"the structural impossibility of 'society'\".</p> <p>In the projection theory of anti-semitism that Pick endorses, the Jews are at once a repository and a mirror, a disturbing cartoon of what Victorian and Fin de Si*cle England feared about itself. 'The internal negativity of society itself,' Pick writes, 'is channelled into the Jew.' The implication is that the projectors are catastrophically unclear about their own values - is it good or bad to have a homeland, to be interested in money, to seek power and influence and sexual satisfaction - and want to foreclose on their own questions and conflicts by producing a scapegoat as an answer. But the drawback of all projection theories - apart from their claim that the unacceptable in ourselves is both representable and potentially knowable - is that they can underestimate the role or agency of the recipients of the projection. It may be glib to say that the Jew and the anti-semite are complicit, but there is no doubt that they are doing something to each other. In other words, if we want to avoid falling into the language of victims and victimisers, it may be more productive to acknowledge, as many psychoanalysts do now, that projection is often a relationship of considerable subtlety. From this point of view, people can be usefully described as being in some sense chosen to be projected into, and as more available to be the recipients of certain projections, by virtue of their own histories and temperaments. People, and groups of people, call up different things in each other - as hypnosis itself disclosed, the range of what is evoked can be bewildering - and this changes over time. Svengali's Web suggests that the image of the Jew as ambivalent subject and object has been unusually durable.</p> <p>The hypnotist removes inhibition, and releases talent, but in doing this he enslaves a person to his will - an extreme description of what every parent, teacher, doctor and political leader does (and knows he does). Svengali's Web inevitably leads us to wonder whether hypnosis makes a mockery of our ideas of freedom, or whether seducing and being seduced is actually all we are free to do. </p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">LRB</a>.

Then we have to imagine what it would be like to live in a world of people who have no wish to help each other or to feel better. If we don't do this, the history of medicine, and of its country cousin psychiatry, not to mention the history of religion, will hardly seem different from a history of quacks and con-artists ingeniously exploiting the hopelessly vulnerable. The question has always been: what, if anything, can be done?

It is fortunate that pain has made us so inventive. As unhappiness shows no sign of disappearing - and its staying power makes us look more like fashion victims than truth-seekers in our quest for therapies - we would do better to think of our solutions as inevitably provisional and uncertain, instead of sneering at them. Our misgivings about the available treatments for our contemporary miseries too easily turns into a cover-story for an intolerance of, or impatience with, suffering itself. Scepticism about treatments becomes suspicion about patients (if the treatment is fraudulent, and it works, then the condition it was nominally treating must be fraudulent too: so everyone's a fool).

The intricate complicity between symptoms and cures - and between what people are considered to be suffering from and what they claim to be suffering from - has made the history of medicine, in its broadest sense, of so much recent interest. Part of the fascination (so to speak) of mesmerism and hypnosis - and of the history that is so well told in Svengali's Web - is that, as potential cures for a wide range of miseries, they were so quickly seen to be at once remarkable breakthroughs, and disreputable, if not criminal activities.

If politics, religion and sexual relations couldn't easily exempt themselves from such a dismaying comparison, why should medicine be able to? Hypnotism was like a terrible cartoon - a secular revelation - of the power people could have over each other, of the enthralled longing to be free from choice. Seeing the amazing things bodies could do to each other - witnessing just how manipulable people's limbs and memories were - made hypnotism as a phenomenon endlessly fascinating, if not actually hypnotic. Since the turn of the last century it has been assumed, or hoped, that a combination of science and history might break its spell. In its sober speculation, and its wealth of often fascinating research, Svengali's Web is in this honourable, but somehow forlorn tradition of lucid and intelligible enquiry into unfathomable craziness. It is the contention of Pick's book that Du Maurier's once extremely famous novel, Trilby, with its evil, hypnotising Jew, Svengali, was a sensation waiting to happen; and that we have to go back to the beginnings of mesmerism in the 18th century, and forward to the advent of psychoanalysis at the turn of the last century, to understand why. The ground, as Pick shows in impressive detail, had been cleared - or rather, given the many theatrical adaptations of Trilby, the stage had been set - for this particular bestseller. Wittingly or unwittingly, Du Maurier had tuned into the spirit of the age, and turned up the volume. Trilby, as Pick says, \"is generally thought to have been the bestselling novel of the last century\"; and this alone makes it, for better and for worse, what used to be called a \"symptomatic text\": a way into the multiple overlapping histories of race and gender and science and pseudo-science in the 19th century.

And one of the things he uses it for is to promote a not unfamiliar progress myth - it was more or less Freud's own myth and so became, more or less, the official line - in which the follies of mesmerism and hypnosis are displaced by the stronger rationality of psychoanalysis. When Freud abrogates hypnosis as a therapeutic technique, psychoanalysis is born, and the 19th century begins to see sense where previously there had only been the hocus-pocus of suggestion.

Yet in the figure of the exploitative, beguiling conductor and his touching victim, Du Maurier had hit on a curiously resonant symbol.\" Svengali's Web is about how such a thing could have happened. Trilby, first published in 1894, is the story of Trilby O'Ferrall, whom we first meet as an artist's model, and friend of three bohemian British artists living and working in Paris. She has her own terrible history as the orphaned daughter of alcoholic parents. In flight from horrible memories she is - it soon becomes obvious - in desperate need of something; she has, the narrator tells us, \"a singularly impressionable nature, as was shown by her quick and ready susceptibility to Svengali's hypnotic influence\". Svengali, the archetypal alien enchanter of Pick's title, eases her pain, as well as facilitating a seemingly astonishing talent.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Du Maurier was a friend of James's and discussed the plot of Trilby with him, the novel is riddled with questions about high and low art. Pick's \"aim\", he says, \"has been to set out the available intellectual, cultural and political ingredients\" from which Du Maurier \"concocted so idiosyncratic and influential a recipe\". And although he achieves this, it is almost at the cost of any kind of close reading of the novel itself. In fact, one of the curious things about Svengali's Web is that Pick seems determined to persuade us that Trilby is not worth reading - except, that is, for the cultural history that a sufficiently informed reader can unpack from it. What makes Trilby such a bad book in Pick's eyes is its \"mawkishness as well as the insistent 'anti-high culture tone'\" - quite apart from the fact that \"Du Maurier was no Proust.\" For 'anti-high culture tone', I think we should read 'questions about high culture', and 'questions about what it might be to be anti-high culture'; if Trilby is alert to anything it is alert to what is done in the name of art and culture. And if we are still in any doubt about the novel's real worth, Pick assures us that \"Du Maurier certainly has some eminent detractors. The highly distinguished literary critic, Professor Frank Kermode, for example, finds precious little to admire in Du Maurier's writing.\" Perhaps Pick wants to protect us (and himself) from the blandishments of the book. One can't be fastidious enough with this novel. \"If the laboured pathos of the story now causes us to flinch,\" Pick writes - again underestimating Du Maurier's shrewd sense of genre \u0086 \"it should be remembered that many of Du Maurier's contemporaries were as deeply absorbed and affected by the novel's themes as they were keen to buy Trilby accessories.\" Using so-called popular culture as a pretext for highbrow commentary has its dangers, of course, the most obvious of which being that it makes the people who enjoy popular culture seem somehow deficient. By dividing the world into the informed and the uninformed - and especially when doing so with historical hindsight - cultural historians easily make themselves sound merely ahead of the game. Even though, as Pick himself points out, Svengali is finally exposed as a fraud, \"the enigma remained: how was one to explain Svengali and company's massive cultural appeal?\" Does that mean that fraudulence only exists in so far as it can be exposed? \"The tale had something extraordinary about it,\" Pick continues, \"a passion had been unleashed in excess of any evident logic, and for reasons that had little to do with literary merit.\" The idea of literary merit, like the idea of fraudulence, depends on surenesses of judgment that the author of Trilby, among others - and Freud was among those others - knew to be under pressure. At the height of his success with Trilby, Svengali showed just how precarious personal judgment is. Hypnotism makes a mockery of good taste. Which is another thing it might share with psychoanalysis. How can so many people - even 'intelligent' people - think bad things are good? the old fashioned intellectual cries. Or even worse, not care whether they are good or bad, but just want them? Pick seems keener to fight a rearguard action for literary merit than to want to rethink it. And this is strange because Svengali's Web is everywhere interested in, and interesting about, the threats to social cohesion posed by alien enchanters of various kinds, and about the implications of this for ideas about the making of a political or aesthetic consensus. If, as he says, \"the alien hypnotist also became a kind of conduit for a much wider contemporary unease concerning the nature of irrational social influences and psychological transmissions,\" then any kind of social rule, or standard, any attempt to set limits or draw boundaries, is under threat. And there could be no more vivid evidence of these irrational influences and transmissions than cultural fads and crazes and fashions, like Trilby itself. Then as now, the anguish aroused by hypnotism was that it revealed all too starkly the ways in which people could be enthused and impressed and persuaded - and even deranged and virtually (or literally) kidnapped - in spite of themselves. Our conscious choices, it suggested, may be as nothing compared with our unconscious (unknown beforehand) powers of discrimination. The problem for the newly emerging 19th-century democrat was that to disdain popularity was to disdain people. If culture wasn't popular, why should it be called culture? And yet the art of capturing the public imagination, as Pick makes abundantly clear, could seem like a very dark art indeed. It is not, of course, obvious why it would have been better - or indeed what the consequences might have been - if the passions unleashed by Trilby had been due to its literary merit rather than its supposed demerit. When Pick writes that \"those tempted to become involved in seances and to succumb to trances were in very good company indeed. Numerous writers, artists and scientists had plunged in at the deep end, not only as patients but as would-be practitioners,\" it is not evident who is being reassured about what. Did the presence of these writers and artists and scientists in some way legitimate these practices, or just show that these distinguished people were as seducible, as impressionable, as everyone else? After all, the thing about hypnotism and its paranormal spin-offs - indeed part of their fascination - was that they played havoc with apparently established hierarchies of class, gender and profession. Everyone, it seemed, was suggestible. Man, as he was then called, was the animal who wanted to seduce and be seduced. Science - in the form of psychology, anthropology, biology - was mobilised, as Pick shows, by mesmerism and hypnosis to explain what we now call seduction. But with the background fear - that has turned out to be largely justified - that explaining seduction might not make a difference to its prevalence or its power; that it may in fact just be another form that seduction can take (people could be usefully said to have been hypnotised by science, and so none the wiser). It's just possible that hypnotism is the best description we have so far come up with for what goes on between people, whether we are talking about parents and children, doctors and patients, or nations and their leaders. This, Pick implies, is what made Trilby take: not that Svengali was a fraud (the existence - and exposure - of fraudulence is itself taken to be proof that somewhere there is a genuine, trustworthy, reliable person), but that such essential distinctions may no longer hold, or that we are no longer interested in making them. The alien enchanter may be longed for as much as he is feared. And it is in writing about the Jew as alien enchanter - with Svengali as the modern prototype - that Pick's book is at its best. There were - and Pick quotes them well - many Victorian writers, of varying professions, who were keen to argue that \"the 'virtues and vices' of\u00c4 the Jews included special powers of psychic manipulation\"; and that they were \"especially prone to the sort of volatile emotional and hypnotic states in which deadly impulses are acted upon\". A Jew like Svengali, \"well-featured but sinister\", as Du Maurier describes him, a brilliant musician and a versatile linguist, at once redeeming and ruining a vulnerable gentile girl, couldn't avoid being a dramatic contribution to a topical debate. In both the popular press and the specialist medical journals, what Pick calls 'the figurative bond between mesmerism and the Jews' became increasingly prominent throughout the 19th century. In such widely read magazines as Punch, \"later Victorian Jews were often represented as 'Svengalian' - ingratiating, seductive, dangerously alluring\u00c4 not only as repulsive, but also as psychologically penetrating.\" What Pick demonstrates above all is the astonishing confusion that Jews evoked in the English. \"In the wider culture,\" he writes, \"they were often said to confound the gentile, to produce an intolerable bafflement.\" The bafflement, it seems, was largely about themselves. \"The repeated perception of the Jews as effective healers but also as potentially lethal magicians\" vied with what Pick calls \"the fear of the Jew's capacity to transform weakness into strength\". Whether they were regarded as \"highly equivocal figures, the bearers of poisons and remedies\", or whether the English couldn't tolerate their own deep-seated (if not actually enthroned) ambivalence, all Pick's documentation suggests that the Jews in England in the 19th century created a conflict in their hosts but not, fortunately, the dire intolerance found later and elsewhere. If Disraeli and Fagin and Svengali shared a certain caricature in England, as Pick suggests, it was chaotically uncertain of its own values. It has been the project of most anti-semites, and some of their critics, to make the Jews into a special case: chosen again either as uniquely fascinating or exceptionally depraved; unusually talented or uniquely scurrilous. What Pick manages to do in Svengali's Web is to place a great deal of primary source material on mostly British 19th century anti-semitism alongside a lucid overview of the more convincing theoretical attempts to make sense of what is, by any standards, bizarre and equivocal material. \"Loaded\", in Pick's words, \"with particularly paradoxical meanings\", the Jew seems in modern times to have been trailed by three legends about himself: that he wanders because he does - or doesn't - have a homeland; that he didn't accept Jesus, who went on to be the idol of the West, as a redeemer; and that compared with his contemporaries in the Bible, he has lasted a very long time (you don't meet many Hittites in European cities). In other words, it is the adaptiveness, the judgment, and the endurance of the Jews that has made them fascinating and suspect. Using Slavoj Zizek's work to ground his own conclusions, Pick suggests, along psychoanalytic lines, that \"Jews serve as a kind of 'lightning conductor' for unwanted parts of the self and for uncontainable social forces. But they also present a category problem\u00c4 they do not have a clear place and their homelessness itself is their defining feature. Jews become the emblem of the unrealisable nature of the idealised, unified human group, of the unachievable idyll of a fully harmonious social order.\" From this point of view, it seems that the Jews remind people of what Zizek calls, rather grandly, \"the structural impossibility of 'society'\". In the projection theory of anti-semitism that Pick endorses, the Jews are at once a repository and a mirror, a disturbing cartoon of what Victorian and Fin de Si*cle England feared about itself. 'The internal negativity of society itself,' Pick writes, 'is channelled into the Jew.' The implication is that the projectors are catastrophically unclear about their own values - is it good or bad to have a homeland, to be interested in money, to seek power and influence and sexual satisfaction - and want to foreclose on their own questions and conflicts by producing a scapegoat as an answer. But the drawback of all projection theories - apart from their claim that the unacceptable in ourselves is both representable and potentially knowable - is that they can underestimate the role or agency of the recipients of the projection. It may be glib to say that the Jew and the anti-semite are complicit, but there is no doubt that they are doing something to each other. In other words, if we want to avoid falling into the language of victims and victimisers, it may be more productive to acknowledge, as many psychoanalysts do now, that projection is often a relationship of considerable subtlety. From this point of view, people can be usefully described as being in some sense chosen to be projected into, and as more available to be the recipients of certain projections, by virtue of their own histories and temperaments. People, and groups of people, call up different things in each other - as hypnosis itself disclosed, the range of what is evoked can be bewildering - and this changes over time. Svengali's Web suggests that the image of the Jew as ambivalent subject and object has been unusually durable. The hypnotist removes inhibition, and releases talent, but in doing this he enslaves a person to his will - an extreme description of what every parent, teacher, doctor and political leader does (and knows he does). Svengali's Web inevitably leads us to wonder whether hypnosis makes a mockery of our ideas of freedom, or whether seducing and being seduced is actually all we are free to do. \u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

Urgent lessons need to be learnt before the first ball kicks off in Euro 2000.\" Approximately 2,000 officers - 20 percent of Denmark's total police force - have been called up for tonight's match, and 1.7 miles of fencing has been erected to keep British and Turkish supporters apart.",

Mr Blair also praised the arrest of the rebel leader in Sierra Leone, Foday Sankoh, saying: \"We can be very proud of our armed forces and what they have done in Sierra Leone.\" He went on to describe Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front as \"this so-called rebel army - that in truth is a criminal gang that has visited the most appalling atrocities on innocent civilians\". William Hague entered the fray early on, asking the prime minister to answer criticism on subjects ranging from police funding to the cost of government 'red tape'. On the subject of benefit fraud, Mr Hague suggested that the prime minister ought to know all about it \"since, after all his broken promises, fraud is his specialist subject\". Changing topics with each question, the Tory leader taunted Mr Blair, saying: \"The truth is that he's in office and that's a killer fact\". The prime minister responded confidently with a string of accusations about the record of the Conservatives when last in office. \"I gave killer facts,\" he concluded, pointing to William Hague. \"The electorate will give killer judgment.\" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy raised the issue of the government's apparently uncertain stance on the single currency. Questioning comments made by Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson - which apparently put him at odds with the chancellor on the subject - and then asking the prime minister \"when he anticipates [the government] meeting its economic criteria\" for entry, he led Mr Blair to declare that \"the position we have is really three positions\". Amid laughter from even his own front bench, the prime minister recovered to claim that \"the best thing is to keep our options open\" - a position identical, he said, to that of the Liberal Democrats.",

Emma Brockes  on what happens to parenting when work is allowed to take over</p>",
      "byline": "Emma Brockes",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is dinnertime in the home of one of Silicon Valley's high powered families and the table is set for five: mom, dad, two kids and a place for one of the family's laptops. Tonight, it is mom's turn to work at the table and she smartly answers emails and builds spreadsheets while her husband reheats the roast chicken he bought on the way home. When they are settled around the table, the kids reel off what after-school activities they're doing tomorrow, and their parents dutifully enter them into their Palm Pilots as if they were meetings with high-level clients. After dinner, the parents kiss them goodnight and promise to page them confirmation by mid-afternoon. Then they return to their screens for a few more hours before bedtime. </p> <p>The work/life debate, the paternity leave debate, all the negotiations that absorb industrial bodies in Britain today, are, to the families of California's Silicon Valley, like relics from a gentler age that never took hold. Silicon Valley is the company town of the new economy's biggest businesses, Apple, Cisco Systems and Adobe, where people work 12 hours a day and fit \"family business\" into the gaps between other commitments. As such, it is a useful forecast of what life might be like if we do not reclaim some semblance of a domain outside work; of how we are staring a social revolution in the face. </p> <p>The most serious impact of the Silicon Valley work model, is on parenting. The dinner table scenario is imagined from research being undertaken by academics at San Jose University. Jan English-Lueck and her team are conducting a two-year study into the lives of 13 middle-class families in the Valley, shadowing them as they go to school, to work or to ballet class, in order to show how technology is changing the way in which families operate. (\"Operate\" is not a loosely-used term. The discipline with which these test families organise themselves can be as rigorously programmed as a computer operating system.) </p> <p>One of the causes of this new, highly accelerated pace of parenting, is communications technology. \"Work is much more mobile than it used to be,\" says English-Lueck. \"You have a laptop that you can take anywhere, including bed. People have told us that they'll come home in the evening and sit there side by side with their laptops, accessing their email and talking about it with each other. That's what constitutes their couple time.\" They are never switched off. </p> <p>Quality time with their children has been effected by the demands of technology. English-Lueck recalls the case of an alienated teenage boy who was tempted back into the family when his mother asked him to explain how a new piece of software worked. \"Families in Silicon Valley can use technology to bind them together, or to separate them,\" says James Freeman, an anthropologist on the San Jose research team. </p> <p>It is the element of separation that forms the most arresting part of the research, raising as it does the spectre of an environment where children are treated as personnel, where family commitments are scheduled using the principles of management and where it is not unusual for responsible parents to lose track of their kids for a couple of hours, allowing them to slip off the radar because the screen is just too damn crowded. \"A child who is five minutes late from hockey practice will throw the parent's whole afternoon schedule off,\" says Freeman. These families do not operate on a routine, but on a series of last-minute arrangements, re-negotiated as other priorities come up. </p> <p>There is no room for error in this strictly timetabled world of parenting. Lueck-English recalls an example of how technology is integrated with a tight logistical schedule. \"The parent was a little bit late picking up the son from school for a singing lesson. Because she had come directly from work, she did not know whether the lesson had been cancelled or not. So she called her other son, had him check the voicemail at home and call her back on the cell phone, all before she got to the intersection where she had to make the turn off for the teacher's house. And that's the way in which people work out the logistics of their day at a very fast, mobile pace.\" </p> <p>A principal barometer of this speed-parenting, is the crossover of language between work and home environments, between managing employees and managing children. \"People are using the language of management and technology in the home,\" says English-Lueck. \"There are a lot of technological metaphors. People talk about their 'downtime'; they ask themselves, 'how many cycles do I have to burn?' I once heard somebody say, 'I don't have the bandwidth to take on girl scouts.' When you mix bandwith with girl scouts, clearly there's something going on.\" </p> <p>Most revealingly, perhaps, is the way in which the word \"family\" is slowly turning from a noun, into a verb. Parents in Silicon Valley have been overheard talking about the need for \"doing family,\" as if it were less of a static unit than one of many activities to be fitted around other obligations. When a parent talks about spending \"quality time\" with his child, it is not a vague reference to hanging out with him or her on the weekend. It is used as a direct oppositional to \"quantity time,\" with the belief that, like everything else in Silicon Valley, if you concentrate hard enough you can achieve just as much in a condensed period as across a longer stretch of time. </p> <p>If this is the case, then parenting is something you do in short, sharp bursts, dosing your children up with parental lessons, so that they have something to work on in your absence. The distinction between work and home blurs to the extent that they can't be viewed as separate domains. The only way to survive as a parent, is to organise your kids as you would your clients, negotiating a contract with your partner over who takes responsibility for which bits of childcare, in extreme cases, \"pitching\" for more relaxed duties. </p> <p>What this means in practical terms is a sort of Palm Pilot parenting. \"My interviewees now talk of using their upgraded Palm Pilots to fully integrate home/work divisions of labour,\" says English-Lueck. \"They beam their schedules to each other. Message machines and pagers allow plans to be created, shifted and coordinated in the space of a single afternoon. In such a world, family may partially dissolve as a distinct cultural domain and become yet another site of work, while workplace relationships become assimilated into the rubric of family.\" </p> <p> To be a well-cared-for child in one of these families is to return home from school not to the physical presence of a mother or father, but to a text message expressing the hope that they had a good day or some other virtual manifestation of an absent parent. Being in electronic contact with a child is what good parenting is about. </p> <p>If this all sounds like a mild form of child abuse, the San Jose researchers have raised what they believe to be the positive aspects of the new order. Whereas parents used to keep discussions about work entirely out of the home, children are now invited to take part in them.

      "bodyText": "It is dinnertime in the home of one of Silicon Valley's high powered families and the table is set for five: mom, dad, two kids and a place for one of the family's laptops. Tonight, it is mom's turn to work at the table and she smartly answers emails and builds spreadsheets while her husband reheats the roast chicken he bought on the way home. When they are settled around the table, the kids reel off what after-school activities they're doing tomorrow, and their parents dutifully enter them into their Palm Pilots as if they were meetings with high-level clients. After dinner, the parents kiss them goodnight and promise to page them confirmation by mid-afternoon. Then they return to their screens for a few more hours before bedtime. The work/life debate, the paternity leave debate, all the negotiations that absorb industrial bodies in Britain today, are, to the families of California's Silicon Valley, like relics from a gentler age that never took hold. Silicon Valley is the company town of the new economy's biggest businesses, Apple, Cisco Systems and Adobe, where people work 12 hours a day and fit \"family business\" into the gaps between other commitments. As such, it is a useful forecast of what life might be like if we do not reclaim some semblance of a domain outside work; of how we are staring a social revolution in the face. The most serious impact of the Silicon Valley work model, is on parenting. The dinner table scenario is imagined from research being undertaken by academics at San Jose University. Jan English-Lueck and her team are conducting a two-year study into the lives of 13 middle-class families in the Valley, shadowing them as they go to school, to work or to ballet class, in order to show how technology is changing the way in which families operate. (\"Operate\" is not a loosely-used term. The discipline with which these test families organise themselves can be as rigorously programmed as a computer operating system.) One of the causes of this new, highly accelerated pace of parenting, is communications technology. \"Work is much more mobile than it used to be,\" says English-Lueck. \"You have a laptop that you can take anywhere, including bed. People have told us that they'll come home in the evening and sit there side by side with their laptops, accessing their email and talking about it with each other. That's what constitutes their couple time.\" They are never switched off. Quality time with their children has been effected by the demands of technology. English-Lueck recalls the case of an alienated teenage boy who was tempted back into the family when his mother asked him to explain how a new piece of software worked. \"Families in Silicon Valley can use technology to bind them together, or to separate them,\" says James Freeman, an anthropologist on the San Jose research team. It is the element of separation that forms the most arresting part of the research, raising as it does the spectre of an environment where children are treated as personnel, where family commitments are scheduled using the principles of management and where it is not unusual for responsible parents to lose track of their kids for a couple of hours, allowing them to slip off the radar because the screen is just too damn crowded. \"A child who is five minutes late from hockey practice will throw the parent's whole afternoon schedule off,\" says Freeman. These families do not operate on a routine, but on a series of last-minute arrangements, re-negotiated as other priorities come up. There is no room for error in this strictly timetabled world of parenting. Lueck-English recalls an example of how technology is integrated with a tight logistical schedule. \"The parent was a little bit late picking up the son from school for a singing lesson. Because she had come directly from work, she did not know whether the lesson had been cancelled or not. So she called her other son, had him check the voicemail at home and call her back on the cell phone, all before she got to the intersection where she had to make the turn off for the teacher's house. And that's the way in which people work out the logistics of their day at a very fast, mobile pace.\" A principal barometer of this speed-parenting, is the crossover of language between work and home environments, between managing employees and managing children. \"People are using the language of management and technology in the home,\" says English-Lueck. \"There are a lot of technological metaphors. People talk about their 'downtime'; they ask themselves, 'how many cycles do I have to burn?' I once heard somebody say, 'I don't have the bandwidth to take on girl scouts.' When you mix bandwith with girl scouts, clearly there's something going on.\" Most revealingly, perhaps, is the way in which the word \"family\" is slowly turning from a noun, into a verb. Parents in Silicon Valley have been overheard talking about the need for \"doing family,\" as if it were less of a static unit than one of many activities to be fitted around other obligations. When a parent talks about spending \"quality time\" with his child, it is not a vague reference to hanging out with him or her on the weekend. It is used as a direct oppositional to \"quantity time,\" with the belief that, like everything else in Silicon Valley, if you concentrate hard enough you can achieve just as much in a condensed period as across a longer stretch of time. If this is the case, then parenting is something you do in short, sharp bursts, dosing your children up with parental lessons, so that they have something to work on in your absence. The distinction between work and home blurs to the extent that they can't be viewed as separate domains. The only way to survive as a parent, is to organise your kids as you would your clients, negotiating a contract with your partner over who takes responsibility for which bits of childcare, in extreme cases, \"pitching\" for more relaxed duties. What this means in practical terms is a sort of Palm Pilot parenting. \"My interviewees now talk of using their upgraded Palm Pilots to fully integrate home/work divisions of labour,\" says English-Lueck. \"They beam their schedules to each other. Message machines and pagers allow plans to be created, shifted and coordinated in the space of a single afternoon. In such a world, family may partially dissolve as a distinct cultural domain and become yet another site of work, while workplace relationships become assimilated into the rubric of family.\" To be a well-cared-for child in one of these families is to return home from school not to the physical presence of a mother or father, but to a text message expressing the hope that they had a good day or some other virtual manifestation of an absent parent. Being in electronic contact with a child is what good parenting is about. If this all sounds like a mild form of child abuse, the San Jose researchers have raised what they believe to be the positive aspects of the new order. Whereas parents used to keep discussions about work entirely out of the home, children are now invited to take part in them. Work is not a cold, distant environment, hostile to family life, but one that is interweaved into the very fabric of familial relations. Children, particularly those highly atuned to new technologies, can act as informal \"consultants\" to their parents. Parents meanwhile, will combine caring for their kids with flagrant networking. \"Family gatherings and social occasions, can be occasions for work-related discussions,\" says Lueck-English. In this context, family is not a constant, a bedrock on which all else rests. It is something that one connects and disconnects with, that appears in the diary as a series of singular events. \"We asked people what made them a family. Repeatedly the answer was 'we do things together.' To these interviewees, the family is not a natural unit that simply exists, but one defined by action.\"",

      "body": "<p>You'd think a Mediterranean beach full of topless sunbathers would have been an uncontroversial place to breastfeed a baby. But no: hardly had I got young Miranda clamped to my boob when a chap I'd been chatting to in the bar the day before sauntered over. \"When,\" he asked, \"do you intend to wean her?\" A plain enough question, but the meaning was clear. He didn't approve. </p> <p>I jokily responded with something about how I'd always fed my babies until they were teenagers, but inside my heart sank. Miranda was just one, and I was suddenly remembering how it felt to breastfeed a toddler, and then a child who was more than a toddler. I'd done it twice before, with my older daughters, and now I was embarking once again on what I knew would be a lonely and increasingly isolated path. Because, while it might be generally acknowledged that breastfeeding is best, our society's very clear view is that it isn't best for long. Breastfeed a toddler, as I do, and you soon become aware of the disapproving looks and furrowed brows. </p> <p>Why so? After all, breastfeeding isn't just for babies. The problem is that our culture, which mistrusts and misunderstands the fundamentals of even early breastfeeding, has failed to get to grips with the fact that it remains a perfectly viable way of supplementing the food - and comfort - of a child of two, three, or even older. Yes, breastfeeding rates may have gone up; and yes, middle-class women may be more likely to start off breastfeeding today than ever: but the first thing many new mothers want to talk about is giving up. For some, it will be in a few weeks, for others, in a few months. But for hardly any will it be in a few years. </p> <p>I don't know why I didn't put a time limit on breastfeeding, but somehow I never did. It took me more than two months to get to grips with feeding my first baby, Rosie. I remember one night when she was four or five months old and I was having problems with sore nipples my mother-in-law, who bottlefed her children, remarked that I should buy in the formula, because I'd surely be giving up feeding her myself soon anyway. And I was shocked, because as far as I was concerned I'd hardly started. </p> <p>In fact I fed Rosie right through my second pregnancy: and after Elinor was born, when Rosie was two, I fed my baby on one side and my toddler on the other most afternoons for over a year, during which we all had a much-needed kip. It was blissful: I look back on those times as among the most contented of my life. </p> <p>Somewhere around the age of three-and-a-half, Rosie had her last breastfeed. I don't recall exactly how it finished, and I certainly don't remember a lump-in-the-throatish final feed: I think she simply decided she was moving on, and I felt neither regrets nor liberation, just that we were entering a new phase. Elinor, who was only 18 months or so, continued to feed until she, too, was at nursery school: and then, like her big sister, she decided to stop. </p> <p>Then Miranda arrived. With the older two I'd been less confident about following my instincts on introducing solids, but with Miranda I was surer of my ground. She had nothing except breastmilk until she was around seven months old, and my milk was certainly her staple food for the entire first year. After all, mothers did manage to raise their children before baby food manufacturers realised what a wheeze it was to sell them four ounces of pureed carrot (\"with no additives\") for 60p. It's always seemed logical to me that babies are designed to live on milk until they can feed themselves, which happens anywhere between six and 18 months - which makes you won der why breastfeeding a child of 12 or 13 months seems so controversial. </p> <p>Even now, at 19 months, Miranda has days when she breastfeeds a lot. She finds it comforting, and I feel I'm her port in a storm if she's a bit under the weather. She certainly seems healthy on it. </p> <p>Like my older daughters, her first word was \"booby\", and I know I'll get plenty of disapproving looks as she calls out for it in company in the months and years ahead. </p> <p>Feeding well beyond babyhood means I've been a breastfeeding mother for seven out of the last eight years. \"God - what's it done to your tits?\" gasp my friends, and I have to admit that, though the books will tell you it's pregnancy not breastfeeding that changes your breast shape, I know mine are a) considerably smaller and b) considerably droopier than they were when I started out. </p> <p>Sex is the other thing friends ask about: doesn't a breastfeeding toddler come between you and your partner, they ask. And while I couldn't honestly claim that breastfeeding is good for your sex life (although one study has surprisingly claimed it is, and that women who breastfeed resume sex more quickly after the birth and have more of it), I do wonder whether it's realistic for any of us to talk about \"getting back to normal\" again. It's not so much breastfeeding as having a baby in the first place that changes your sex life. </p> <p>Breastfeeding long-term has been easy for me because I work from home, but it can be done even if you work in an office. You don't have to feed your child through the day if you're to feed her at all: some women breastfeed only in the evenings through the week, and then up their feeds to daytimes at weekends. When Elinor was two I left her with my husband and took Rosie away for two days, expecting that Elinor probably wouldn't bother again. I returned to be told she'd been fine, but to my surprise that evening she climbed blithely onto my knee muttering \"booby\", and we took up where we'd left off. </p> <p>Many have tried to caution me against long-term breastfeeding: you'll get tired, they say (although I don't), and you'll be feeding them for ever. That's nonsense, of course: even if, like me, you go on feeding for years, in no time at all you'll be looking back from the vantage-point of primary school, as I now do with my older daughters, and it will all be behind you. Breastfeeding, by definition, is never going to be more than a brief spell in the early life of a child: all I'm saying is, it doesn't have to be quite as brief as many mothers make it.</p>",

Elinor, who was only 18 months or so, continued to feed until she, too, was at nursery school: and then, like her big sister, she decided to stop. Then Miranda arrived. With the older two I'd been less confident about following my instincts on introducing solids, but with Miranda I was surer of my ground. She had nothing except breastmilk until she was around seven months old, and my milk was certainly her staple food for the entire first year. After all, mothers did manage to raise their children before baby food manufacturers realised what a wheeze it was to sell them four ounces of pureed carrot (\"with no additives\") for 60p. It's always seemed logical to me that babies are designed to live on milk until they can feed themselves, which happens anywhere between six and 18 months - which makes you won der why breastfeeding a child of 12 or 13 months seems so controversial. Even now, at 19 months, Miranda has days when she breastfeeds a lot. She finds it comforting, and I feel I'm her port in a storm if she's a bit under the weather. She certainly seems healthy on it. Like my older daughters, her first word was \"booby\", and I know I'll get plenty of disapproving looks as she calls out for it in company in the months and years ahead. Feeding well beyond babyhood means I've been a breastfeeding mother for seven out of the last eight years. \"God - what's it done to your tits?\" gasp my friends, and I have to admit that, though the books will tell you it's pregnancy not breastfeeding that changes your breast shape, I know mine are a) considerably smaller and b) considerably droopier than they were when I started out. Sex is the other thing friends ask about: doesn't a breastfeeding toddler come between you and your partner, they ask. And while I couldn't honestly claim that breastfeeding is good for your sex life (although one study has surprisingly claimed it is, and that women who breastfeed resume sex more quickly after the birth and have more of it), I do wonder whether it's realistic for any of us to talk about \"getting back to normal\" again. It's not so much breastfeeding as having a baby in the first place that changes your sex life. Breastfeeding long-term has been easy for me because I work from home, but it can be done even if you work in an office. You don't have to feed your child through the day if you're to feed her at all: some women breastfeed only in the evenings through the week, and then up their feeds to daytimes at weekends. When Elinor was two I left her with my husband and took Rosie away for two days, expecting that Elinor probably wouldn't bother again. I returned to be told she'd been fine, but to my surprise that evening she climbed blithely onto my knee muttering \"booby\", and we took up where we'd left off. Many have tried to caution me against long-term breastfeeding: you'll get tired, they say (although I don't), and you'll be feeding them for ever. That's nonsense, of course: even if, like me, you go on feeding for years, in no time at all you'll be looking back from the vantage-point of primary school, as I now do with my older daughters, and it will all be behind you. Breastfeeding, by definition, is never going to be more than a brief spell in the early life of a child: all I'm saying is, it doesn't have to be quite as brief as many mothers make it.",

But you can get emails which will start, 'I feel like shit, I want to die', or in two paragraphs will contain the full horror of their situation, both of which can be quite tough to respond to.\" The Samaritans' policy is to allow the caller or emailer always to be in control of the exchange, which means that the group will not usually keep sending emails without a response. \"Very occasionally we might email someone once, just to ask how they're getting on,\" Leibovici says. \"There have been a few times when I have done this, only to get the email bounced back to me as the account has been closed. Inevitably, you think the worst, but there's no way of knowing what has happened.\" Despite its difficulties, Leibovici is an ardent advocate of the Samaritans' use of email. \"We didn't start this to be fashionable,\" he insists. \"I feel strongly that we should be available to befriend people in any way they feel most comfortable.\" \u0095 Volunteer recruitment line: 0990 627282",

Put alongside our large body of evidence of older people's own experiences, they draw a line under the government's insistence that treatment is provided on clinical need alone. Instead, more than three quarters of Britain's 35,000 GPs confirm that age-based rationing does occur. And while nearly all GPs support the principle of priority on the basis of clinical need and no other factor including age, 42% say this is not happening. </p> <p>The survey provides confirmation of the existence of upper age limits on treatments, from heart bypass operations to the most effective treatment for cancer. Age Concern recently highlighted the case of 65-year-old Leonard Wilson, whose own experience uncovered an apparent policy to refuse heart transplants to anyone over 60. This new survey finds that 63% of GPs are also aware of an upper age limit on heart transplants. </p> <p>GPs go on to express alarm at the quality of care in hospitals with 43% saying they would have concerns about a frail elderly relative going into their local hospital. One GP commented: \"In hospital, you have to be able to feed yourself as the nurses don't do it. If you are frail, you've had it.\" Another points out: \"In our area, we are fortunate to have a good geriatric service, but the attitudes of hospital staff can be a problem. GPs have to apologise for the admission of elderly patients.\" </p> <p>This new insight into the NHS comes as part of Age Concern's campaign to tackle the ageism which is inherent at all levels of the service. Over the past year, we have received detailed accounts from over 2,000 older people and their relatives. Many have spoken out with great courage, having suffered appallingly at the hands of the medical profession. Their stories, and the emerging trends in their evidence, were presented in November in a report entitled \"Turning your back on us: Older people and the NHS\". </p> <p>Many of these older people ask why they are \"fobbed off\" by their GPs - often receiving treatment only with the help of an advocate, usually a family member. This new survey begins to provide some answers. It finds that 16% of GPs decide not to make a referral because they suspect that, on account of their age, the older patient won't get treated anyway. One in 10 fail to refer because they know of age barriers. But worryingly, 8% (equivalent to 2,800 GPs) said they thought their patients had already had \"a good innings\". </p> <p>Throughout, Age Concern has been left in no doubt as to older people's loyalty to the NHS. Those who speak out against unfair treatment do it because they feel so \"let down\" by a service they have supported throughout their lives. They are the first to praise good practice, but they also know when they are being denied treatment and the best quality of care. </p> <p> This point has never been so well highlighted as in the case of 67-year-old Jill Baker, who last month spoke of her horror at finding a \"do not resuscitate\" (DNR) instruction on her medical notes. Within two days, Age Concern received 100 new cases of resuscitation decisions being made without the involvement of older patients or their relatives. </p> <p>In a BMJ editorial, Professor Shah Ebrahim asks if there is evidence that DNR orders made with out consent are a barometer for unethical, inadequate care.

William Payne is experienced and well respected in his field, yet his arrival on May 8 went almost unremarked - which is strange because he is the fourth head in four years to lead this institution. If this institution were a school, particularly a failing school, then another change in leadership would be momentous. But this is Feltham, Britain's largest young offender institution. It contains around 800 of our most vulnerable and volatile boys and young men. The three previous governors didn't resign, they were promoted to senior management positions within the prison service. Feltham, in Middlesex, is an institution characterised by change. It has a particularly high turnover of staff and managers and a vast catchment area. Half its population is held on remand in a state of uncertainty. Many young men at Feltham will have experienced a disrupted home and school life, poor parental supervision and poverty. They are significantly more likely than other young people to have mental health problems and to have been neglected or abused. It is an institution which, arguably more than most, needs a stable centre and exceptional management.

But as well as being up front with staff, Taylor also told delegates to employ the tactics of a sleuth - advice which may be useful in his new role at the charity watchdog. \"Act as a mystery shopper, visit the website to see if it is up to date, telephone in with an inquiry, or try to make a donation,\" he advised. \"It can be quite appalling how donors are treated.\" </p> <p>Less surreptitious ways of detecting trouble, he continued, are going on a walkabout around the office and watching the body language of staff who attend the board meeting. Although Taylor admitted no treasurer could do their day job and carry out all his recommendations, he believes even following a little of his advice could help avoid disaster. One of the most important pieces of advice to treasurers was not to let other colleagues on the trustee board opt out of financial responsibility. All trustees are jointly liable for a charity's financial health. </p> <p>As well as being doctor and sleuth, treasurers were also advised to act like helicopter pilots at the conference. Nigel Scott, finance director of Children's Aid Direct, advised delegates to hover above the day-to- day operations but also to look ahead. \"Treasurers are probably going to be there longer than staff, so they should take responsibility for looking three to 10 years ahead.\" </p> <p>How far in advance a charity can budget accurately will depend on the certainty of income. At Children's Aid Direct, plans are reviewed every six months. Scott says: \"It is not a heinous crime to deviate from the budget, but there needs to be an explanation.\" </p> <p>Despite all the advice about avoiding risk, Pesh Framjee, head of the charity unit at accountants Arthur Andersen and Binder Hamlyn, advised treasurers not to be risk averse. \"Charities need to take risks to be innovative,\" he said, but advised treasurers to make sure they are given all the information they need before deciding to take a risk. Once the decision has been made, they should insist on being given information to allow monitoring and evaluation.

That is a good thing in so far as it has been a matter of choice, but recently we have seen people forced out of work in their fifties. The difficulty of returning to work, for reasons of health, benefit traps and age discrimination, have kept them out of the labour market. The proportion of men working after the age of 50 has been falling since the 1980s. Of men aged 55-64, less than half are now in the workforce. </p> <p>Women have been working longer for several decades but their participation, too, has dipped recently for those in their late fifties. </p> <p>These trends matter not just for the lifestyle, health and self-respect of those concerned but for society's capacity to support a decent life for its older citizens. Whether we finance pensions and health care out of individual savings or taxation, no one will enjoy a great standard of living in old age if we try to fund 80 years of life on incomes earned in only 30 of those years. </p> <p>This accelerated trend to early retirement is also found in most European countries - indeed, at a higher rate than in the UK. But not so, since the mid-1980s, in the US. </p> <p>From 1880 through to 1980, the US experienced the same steady fall in labour market participation by older men. Then, in the mid-1980s, American men stopped retiring earlier. US participation rates then rose through the 1990s for men and more sharply for women. </p> <p>In 1960, the US average retirement age in 1980 was lower than the UK. Now it is a year longer and rising. In the 1990s, the percentage of men in their sixties in the labour force rose by about 0.3% a year and women by about 0.5%. This adds up to a very significant change over the decade. </p> <p>It is something of a puzzle, but the most obvious explanation is that the American economy has been doing so well that older workers are in big demand. In fact, though, the trend turned long before the present boom. Economists can only explain a part of the change in these cyclical terms. Restructuring and down-sizing have been as prevalent in the US as in the UK. </p> <p>One difference seems to be that Americans who leave their main job are much more likely to take up new work. Roughly half of all men and women who leave their main job get another \"bridging\" job. They can take a reduced pension at 62 and work. In the UK, many took incap-acity benefit and never returned to work. </p> <p>Family incomes in the US stagnated from the 1970s through to the early 1990s. This followed a prolonged post-war rise in incomes. People may have just felt less prosperous. But the trend to longer working lives has gone on after prosperity returned. </p> <p>There is also a flexible service-based labour market in the US ready to take on older workers. But the UK labour market is also reasonably flexible and service based. </p> <p>Another possible explanation is the reduced generosity in US public and private pensions that took place in the early 1980s. However, we outdid anything the Americans managed at that point. Our state pensions are smaller and were reduced faster than on the US side of the Atlantic. So that will not do as an explanation either. </p> <p>Losing health care coverage by your employer before Medicare can be claimed is a major problem for older Americans. But, then, it always has been. </p> <p>One is forced to conclude that a number of policy changes the Americans made did actually work. The US government made a series of changes to combat age discrimination and remove perverse incentives built into their social security system that encouraged early retirement. These policy changes took place in the 1980s just before the trend changed. </p> <p>In 1986, Congress passed the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which prohibited employers from dismissing workers on the basis of age. No contract could specify an end point based on age.

This probably changed people's perception of when it is \"normal\" to retire. Survey evidence suggests these dates are symbolically important. </p> <p>Congress also removed the perverse incentive for older people to take their pension as soon as possible. If you waited you lost substantial sums in potential lifetime pension. </p> <p>The formula changes give Americans a broad age band over which they can retire, receiving reduced pensions if they retire early and much enhanced ones if they retire later.

That is a good thing in so far as it has been a matter of choice, but recently we have seen people forced out of work in their fifties. The difficulty of returning to work, for reasons of health, benefit traps and age discrimination, have kept them out of the labour market. The proportion of men working after the age of 50 has been falling since the 1980s. Of men aged 55-64, less than half are now in the workforce. Women have been working longer for several decades but their participation, too, has dipped recently for those in their late fifties.

      "body": "<p>Recently, I was visiting Bhatinda in Punjab because of an epidemic of farmers' suicides. Punjab used to be the most prosperous region in India, but today every farmer is in debt and despair. Vast stretches of land have become waterlogged desert. As an old farmer pointed out, even the trees have stopped bearing fruit because heavy use of pesticides has killed the pollinators - the bees and butterflies. </p> <p>Punjab is not alone in experiencing this ecological and social disaster. Last year, I was in Warangal, Andhra Pradesh, where farmers have also been committing suicide. Farmers who traditionally grew pulses and millets and paddy have been lured by seed companies to buy hybrid cotton seeds - referred to by the seed merchants as \"white gold\" - which were supposed to make them millionaires. Instead they became paupers. </p> <p>Their native seeds have been displaced with new hybrids which cannot be saved and need to be purchased every year at high cost. Hybrids are also vulnerable to pest attacks, and spending on pesticides in Warangal has shot up 2,000% since 1997. Now farmers are consuming the same pesticides as a way of killing themselves so that they can escape permanently from unpayable debt. </p> <p>Experiences such as these tell me that we are so wrong to be smug about the new global economy. It is time to stop and think about the impact of globalisation on the lives of ordinary people. This is vital to achieve sustainability. </p> <p>What we are doing in the name of globalisation to the poor is brutal and unforgivable as we witness the unfolding disasters, especially in food and agriculture. </p> <p>Who feeds the world? It is women and small farmers working with biodiversity who are the primary food providers in the third world. And, contrary to the dominant assumption, their biodiversity-based small farms are more productive than industrial monocultures. </p> <p>When measured in terms of nutrition per acre, and from the perspective of biodiversity, the \"high yields\" of industrial agriculture or industrial fisheries do not imply more production of food and nutrition. Planting multiple crops in a mixture will have low yields of individual crops, but will have high total output of food. Research done by the Food and Agriculture Administration has shown that small biodiverse farms can produce thousands of times more food than large, industrial monocultures. And diversity, in addition to giving more food, is the best strategy for preventing drought and desertification. </p> <p>What the world needs to feed a growing population sustainably is biodiversity intensification, not the chemical intensification or the intensification of genetic engineering. Yet we are repeatedly told that, without genetic engineering and globalisation of agriculture, the world will starve. </p> <p>This deliberate blindness to diversity, the blindness to nature's production, production by women, production by third world farmers, allows destruction and appropriation to be projected as creation. </p> <p>Women who produce for their families and communities are treated as \"non-productive\" and \"economically\" inactive. The devaluation of women's work, and of work done in sustainable economies, is the natural outcome of a system constructed by capitalist patriarchy. This is how globalisation destroys local economies - and destruction itself is counted as growth. </p> <p>Because many women in rural and indigenous communities work co-operatively with nature's processes, their work is often contradictory to the dominant market-driven \"development\" and trade policies. And because work that satisfies needs and ensures sustenance is devalued in general, there is less nurturing of life and life support systems. </p> <p>Everywhere, food production is becoming a negative economy, with farmers spending more to buy costly inputs for industrial production than the price they receive for their produce. The consequence is rising debts and epidemics of suicides both in poor and rich countries. </p> <p>Capital-intensive, corporate controlled agriculture is being spread into regions where peasants are poor but, until now, have been self-sufficient in food. The globalisation of non-sustainable industrial agriculture is evaporating the incomes of third world farmers through a combination of devaluation of currencies, increase in costs of production and a collapse in commodity prices. </p> <p>While farmers earn less, consumers pay more. In India, food prices doubled between 1999 and 2000, and the consumption of food grains in rural areas has dropped by 12%. Increased economic growth through global commerce is based on pseudo surpluses. More food is being traded while the poor are consuming less. When growth increases poverty, when real production becomes a negative economy and speculators are defined as \"wealth creators\", something has gone seriously wrong. </p> <p>Global consultants fail to see the 99% food processing done by women at household level, or by the small cottage industry, because it is not controlled by global agribusiness. In India, 99% of agro-processing has been intentionally kept at the small level. Now, under the pressure of globalisation, things are changing. </p> <p>In August 1998, small-scale local processing of edible oil was devastated in India through a \"packaging order\" which required all oil to be packaged in plastic or aluminium. This shut down tiny \"ghanis\", or cold pressed mills. It destroyed the market for our diverse oilseeds - mustard, linseed, sesame, groundnut, coconut. </p> <p>The takeover of the edible oil industry has affected 10m livelihoods. The takeover of flour, or \"atta\", by packaged branded flour will cost 100m livelihoods. These millions are being pushed into new poverty, while the forced use of packaging will increase the environmental burden with millions of tonnes of waste. </p> <p>A global monoculture is being forced on people by defining everything that is fresh, local and handmade as a health hazard. Human hands are being defined as the worst contaminants, and work for human hands is being outlawed, to be replaced by machines and chemicals bought from global corporations. These are not recipes for feeding the world, but stealing livelihoods from the poor to create markets for the powerful. </p> <p>The US Center for Disease Prevention in Atlanta has calculated that nearly 81m cases of food-borne illnesses occur in the US every year. Most of these infections are caused by factory farmed meat, but now the giant US meat industry wants to dump contaminated meat produced through violent and cruel methods on Indian consumers. The waste of the rich is being dumped on the poor. </p> <p>Moreover, the wealth of the poor is being violently appropriated through new and clever means like patents on biodiversity and indigenous knowledge. Basmati, neem, pepper, bitter gourd, turmeric . . . every aspect of the innovation embodied in our indigenous food and medicinal systems is now being pirated and patented. The knowledge of the poor is being converted into the property of global corporations, creating a situation where the poor will have to pay for the seeds and medicines they have evolved. Sharing and exchange - the basis of our humanity and of our ecological survival - has been redefined as a crime. </p> <p>In 1992, when Indian farmers destroyed Cargill's seed plant in Bellary, Karnataka, to protest against seed failure, the Cargill chief executive stated: \"We bring Indian farmers smart technologies which prevent bees from usurping the pollen\". When I was participating in the UN biosafety negotiations, Monsanto circulated literature to defend its herbicide resistant Roundup Ready crops on grounds that they prevent \"weeds from stealing the sunshine\". But what Monsanto calls weeds are the green fields that provide Vitamin A rice and prevent blindness in children and anaemia in women. </p> <p>When giant corporations view small peasants and bees as thieves, and through trade rules and new technologies seek the right to exterminate them, humanity has reached a dangerous threshold. Sustainability, sharing and survival is being economically outlawed in the name of market competitiveness. </p> <p>In giving food to other beings and species we maintain conditions for our own food security. In feeding earthworms, we feed ourselves; in feeding cows, we feed the soil; and in providing food for the soil, we provide food for humans. </p> <p>The sustainability challenge for the new millennium is whether global economic man can move out of the world view based on fear and scarcity, monocultures and monopolies, appropriation and dispossession and shift to a view based on abundance and sharing, diversity and decentralisation, and respect and dignity for all beings. </p> <p>Economic globalisation has become a war against nature and the poor. But the rules of globalisation are not god-given. They can be changed. They must be changed. We can survive as a species only if we live by the rules of the biosphere. As Gandhi had reminded us: \"The earth has enough for everyone's needs, but not for some people's greed.\"</p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited extract of Vandana Shiva's Reith lecture last week.

This shut down tiny \"ghanis\", or cold pressed mills. It destroyed the market for our diverse oilseeds - mustard, linseed, sesame, groundnut, coconut. The takeover of the edible oil industry has affected 10m livelihoods. The takeover of flour, or \"atta\", by packaged branded flour will cost 100m livelihoods. These millions are being pushed into new poverty, while the forced use of packaging will increase the environmental burden with millions of tonnes of waste. A global monoculture is being forced on people by defining everything that is fresh, local and handmade as a health hazard. Human hands are being defined as the worst contaminants, and work for human hands is being outlawed, to be replaced by machines and chemicals bought from global corporations. These are not recipes for feeding the world, but stealing livelihoods from the poor to create markets for the powerful. The US Center for Disease Prevention in Atlanta has calculated that nearly 81m cases of food-borne illnesses occur in the US every year. Most of these infections are caused by factory farmed meat, but now the giant US meat industry wants to dump contaminated meat produced through violent and cruel methods on Indian consumers. The waste of the rich is being dumped on the poor. Moreover, the wealth of the poor is being violently appropriated through new and clever means like patents on biodiversity and indigenous knowledge. Basmati, neem, pepper, bitter gourd, turmeric . . . every aspect of the innovation embodied in our indigenous food and medicinal systems is now being pirated and patented. The knowledge of the poor is being converted into the property of global corporations, creating a situation where the poor will have to pay for the seeds and medicines they have evolved. Sharing and exchange - the basis of our humanity and of our ecological survival - has been redefined as a crime. In 1992, when Indian farmers destroyed Cargill's seed plant in Bellary, Karnataka, to protest against seed failure, the Cargill chief executive stated: \"We bring Indian farmers smart technologies which prevent bees from usurping the pollen\". When I was participating in the UN biosafety negotiations, Monsanto circulated literature to defend its herbicide resistant Roundup Ready crops on grounds that they prevent \"weeds from stealing the sunshine\". But what Monsanto calls weeds are the green fields that provide Vitamin A rice and prevent blindness in children and anaemia in women. When giant corporations view small peasants and bees as thieves, and through trade rules and new technologies seek the right to exterminate them, humanity has reached a dangerous threshold. Sustainability, sharing and survival is being economically outlawed in the name of market competitiveness. In giving food to other beings and species we maintain conditions for our own food security. In feeding earthworms, we feed ourselves; in feeding cows, we feed the soil; and in providing food for the soil, we provide food for humans. The sustainability challenge for the new millennium is whether global economic man can move out of the world view based on fear and scarcity, monocultures and monopolies, appropriation and dispossession and shift to a view based on abundance and sharing, diversity and decentralisation, and respect and dignity for all beings. Economic globalisation has become a war against nature and the poor. But the rules of globalisation are not god-given. They can be changed. They must be changed. We can survive as a species only if we live by the rules of the biosphere. As Gandhi had reminded us: \"The earth has enough for everyone's needs, but not for some people's greed.\" \u0095 This is an edited extract of Vandana Shiva's Reith lecture last week. This year's final lecture, by Prince Charles, is on Radio 4 at 8pm tonight.",

No shop, no school, no pub, no church. There is a sloping playing-field and a village hall (first world war barrack hut donated by the then owner of North Dean house) and 18 other listed buildings. Almost twice as many cars as houses. There are a few families with local forebears, but many more have moved in during middle age and stayed on. Good holidays abroad are enjoyed by the comfortably retired. Neighbourhood Watch, and five buses a day. </p> <p>How should we in North Dean celebrate the millennium? At the village hall committee (first Monday in the month at 8pm) we decided last year on a Domesday photographic survey (now almost complete), an embroidery of the village's comely features (still stitching) and, more recently, an engraved boulder (message to posterity not yet decided) - all to be unveiled at a midsummer party with procession, barbecue and fancy dress. </p> <p>A few of us felt, however, that as well, we could celebrate the millennium by doing something for a developing country - perhaps small, like us, but less well off. We decided to ask, in principle, whether each household would contribute \"whatever you would normally spend on an evening out\" to such a scheme. After delivering a flyer to each house, between us we knocked on every door and got a most positive response. </p> <p>One resident, we found, had particular knowledge and contacts. David had spent many recent years in Uganda in the mission field. At an open meeting he spoke of the fine medical work of a particular group of Ugandan nuns, and all present agreed that this would be our chosen cause. They needed, Sister Ernestine's letter said, a building for their work with HIV and Aids patients. They had had 1,029 new cases in the previous year - from new-born up. </p> <p>So, another flyer to every home, a small, but profitable, dance and we started collecting for the \"North Dean Third World Project\". Many households donated \u00a320, \u00a330 or \u00a350. No less valued was the pensioner's fiver - \"I don't go out at all now, but I'd like to be involved.\" Some, of course, gave elsewhere, some could not afford it, a few needed to \"ask my husband\", one looked sadly at me and wordlessly shook his head. But the great majority (perhaps 85%) contributed generously; \u00a3100 came from a musical evening, and our bank balance slowly climbed beyond \u00a33,500. </p> <p>David was prepared to go out and see to the building, and through another North Deaner, who works for BA, a free flight (thank you BA!) was arranged, which freed up a little more for the project. How much did we need to build what the nuns wanted? Probably \u00a310,000, but a useful, extendable \"stage one\" would cost \u00a36,000. </p> <p>As the date of David's departure approached, another flyer asked if anyone in the village would lend another couple of thousand till September (when we shall have a much bigger dance) - and, wonderfully, we had four offers. </p> <p>So, early in February, David flew out with the \u00a36,310. A ward, 80ft by 30 ft, is up, roofed and the plastering nearly complete. Another North Dean family with medical connections in Uganda recently visited Lowero, saw the work in progress, and may be able to channel help and medicine to the nuns . . . so Lowero may get more than just the North Dean ward. </p> <p>It may only be a small, incomplete, project from one village, but we've been lucky and we've enjoyed it. And we are (just a little) proud that we have got somewhere. Perhaps, too, another small community might like the idea and . . . if that is taken as a challenge, another developing community would benefit. We would be happy to be outclassed.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The Chinese internet revolution is causing a dilemma for the Communist party, which is torn between trying to spearhead online developments and trying to slow them down.</p> <p>This week the latest stern statements on Taiwan can be seen on the People's Liberation Army's own website. Beijing has also launched a 24-hour news site called One Thousand Dragons which promises to carry one thousand items a day.</p> <p>With the number of internet users already close to 10m, e-commerce is beginning to boom and websites are exploring everything from online mahjong to fashion advice and gossip on film stars.</p> <p>The independent sites are more cautious about news coverage. Last week the head of a new government-sponsored Internet Information Management Bureau said that new rules will limit sites to using material from the official press.</p> <p>\"News is a really sensitive area,\" says one executive from an independent site. \"We ask ourselves all the time how we can develop without being shut down. It's like playing a game with no rules. They just come back later to say you can't do it.\"</p> <p>The internet explosion is the latest phase in a computer revolution which is little more than five years old. Zhongguancun, in north Beijing, is known as China's Silicon Valley. It has engulfed Haidian, a village of brick and mud houses where street sellers still cry out their wares.</p> <p>Until the 1980s most of the surrounding land was farmed by peasants. Now Zhongguancun has launched phase two of an expansion plan. Where students from nearby Beijing University used to cycle along paths between the fields, billboards now advertise new internet sites.</p> <p>Some experts warn that the high growth rate of software companies cannot be maintained but there is still a huge potential demand among China's emerging urban middle class. The number of internet users is expected to double to 20m within the next two to three years.</p> <p>At lunchtime in Haidian, the Beijing Silicon Valley Computer Plaza is coping with the rush. Outside the five-storey building, touts offer cut-price software while personal computers are loaded onto handcarts and pedicabs.</p> <p><b> Increasing demand</b><br></p> <p>\"Two years ago, people didn't know what the internet was,\" says Yu Hongyan, the general manager of the Zhaodaola website. Taxi-drivers would say: 'Internet, is that a new hotel near the airport?'\"</p> <p>Zhaodaola - the name means \"I've found it!\" - is backed by a US company owned by the rightwing evangelist Pat Robertson. It calls itself a \"lifestyle portal\" and is now about to launch an e-commerce business.</p> <p>\"A person has to spend much time looking for something, whether it be a job, a friend, a house or a lover,\" says Ms Yu, who appeared on a recent front cover of the Beijing magazine China Today to illustrate how women's lives have been transformed. \"People in China are aiming for a better life. We are entitled to the quality you get in the US and Japan. We are targeting the 20 to 35-year-olds and trying to attract more women. That's why we have a special channel called 'Real Women?' as well as another one called 'Macho Men'.\"</p> <p>Across Beijing from Zhaodaola's headquarters is the media monitoring company SinoFile, which scans up to 500 newspapers for mainly commercial clients. It is about to go online. \"Bill Gates is the number one hero,\" says its chief operations officer, Yang Zhi. \"Everyone is becoming web aware: it's like a new drug.\"</p> <p>Ms Yang's career reflects the rapid shifts in values since the Cultural Revolution, when she was sent to the countryside while her parents - both famous translators of Chinese literature - were imprisoned in Beijing.

      "bodyText": "The Chinese internet revolution is causing a dilemma for the Communist party, which is torn between trying to spearhead online developments and trying to slow them down. This week the latest stern statements on Taiwan can be seen on the People's Liberation Army's own website. Beijing has also launched a 24-hour news site called One Thousand Dragons which promises to carry one thousand items a day. With the number of internet users already close to 10m, e-commerce is beginning to boom and websites are exploring everything from online mahjong to fashion advice and gossip on film stars. The independent sites are more cautious about news coverage. Last week the head of a new government-sponsored Internet Information Management Bureau said that new rules will limit sites to using material from the official press. \"News is a really sensitive area,\" says one executive from an independent site. \"We ask ourselves all the time how we can develop without being shut down. It's like playing a game with no rules. They just come back later to say you can't do it.\" The internet explosion is the latest phase in a computer revolution which is little more than five years old. Zhongguancun, in north Beijing, is known as China's Silicon Valley. It has engulfed Haidian, a village of brick and mud houses where street sellers still cry out their wares. Until the 1980s most of the surrounding land was farmed by peasants. Now Zhongguancun has launched phase two of an expansion plan. Where students from nearby Beijing University used to cycle along paths between the fields, billboards now advertise new internet sites. Some experts warn that the high growth rate of software companies cannot be maintained but there is still a huge potential demand among China's emerging urban middle class. The number of internet users is expected to double to 20m within the next two to three years. At lunchtime in Haidian, the Beijing Silicon Valley Computer Plaza is coping with the rush. Outside the five-storey building, touts offer cut-price software while personal computers are loaded onto handcarts and pedicabs. Increasing demand \"Two years ago, people didn't know what the internet was,\" says Yu Hongyan, the general manager of the Zhaodaola website. Taxi-drivers would say: 'Internet, is that a new hotel near the airport?'\" Zhaodaola - the name means \"I've found it!\" - is backed by a US company owned by the rightwing evangelist Pat Robertson. It calls itself a \"lifestyle portal\" and is now about to launch an e-commerce business. \"A person has to spend much time looking for something, whether it be a job, a friend, a house or a lover,\" says Ms Yu, who appeared on a recent front cover of the Beijing magazine China Today to illustrate how women's lives have been transformed. \"People in China are aiming for a better life. We are entitled to the quality you get in the US and Japan. We are targeting the 20 to 35-year-olds and trying to attract more women. That's why we have a special channel called 'Real Women?' as well as another one called 'Macho Men'.\" Across Beijing from Zhaodaola's headquarters is the media monitoring company SinoFile, which scans up to 500 newspapers for mainly commercial clients. It is about to go online. \"Bill Gates is the number one hero,\" says its chief operations officer, Yang Zhi. \"Everyone is becoming web aware: it's like a new drug.\" Ms Yang's career reflects the rapid shifts in values since the Cultural Revolution, when she was sent to the countryside while her parents - both famous translators of Chinese literature - were imprisoned in Beijing. In the 1980s she studied in the US, returning with a PhD to help set up an institute for the study of ancient civilisations but left academia to found SinoFile in 1992 with her Canadian husband, David Jacobson. While the new internet revolution gathers pace, the Chinese leadership is divided on whether to tighten or loosen controls. In January new rules published by the state secrecy bureau imposed tough security checks banning the discussion or transfer of all \"secret information\" - a term which is very loosely defined. In the same month, regulations came into force requiring foreign firms to register the type of encryption software which they used, in theory making it possible for the government to monitor all internet transactions. But secrecy checks are now being ignored and encryption requirements have been eased to conform to World Trade Organisation regulations. After months of conflicting signals, Beijing has finally allowed the first China-based web site to go public overseas. Sina.com, China's most popular site, is now listed on the Nasdaq exchange. Other companies complain that the authorities left it too late for them to cash in on the worldwide hi-tech shares explosion. Even if the current bubble bursts, the internet tide seems unstoppable. Provincial Communist party bosses now list web development as a top priority - though they often have little idea what it means. \"The party has stayed in power because it is a 'vanguard force',\" President Jiang Zemin told this year's National People's Congress. \"To continue to be so, senior cadres must equip themselves better by learning internet technology.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The last time Foday Sankoh, the leader of Sierra Leone's Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels, was arrested and charged with treason, he ended up as vice president of the country, in charge of its valuable diamond fields. He is unlikely to be so fortunate on this occasion.</p> <p>Sankoh was paraded naked through the streets of Freetown today after being captured, reportedly by pro-government soldiers backed by the British intervention force. His re-emergence, 10 days after he disappeared from his heavily guarded Freetown home put an end to speculation that he had been killed, had died of a heart attack, or had fled up-country to join his RUF fighters.</p> <p>But mystery continued to surround Sankoh's whereabouts during the intervening period. His disappearance closely followed the arrival of British special forces in Sierra Leone and the assertion of overall British direction of the UN and government anti-insurgency effort. Activity near his home by personnel attached to the US embassy in Freetown was also reported around the time he vanished. No explanation has yet emerged about the fate of his numerous bodyguards.</p> <p>The question now is what to do with Sankoh. People who crowded on to the streets of Freetown to celebrate his capture seemed to be in no doubt. \"The masses must decide,\" one resident was quoted as saying. \"He made the people of this country suffer for nine years...He is not fit to exist.\" Another onlooker said: \"We should kill that man today\".</p> <p>The Sierra Leone government to which Sankoh officially belongs may also be tempted to dispose of him as quickly as possible. Sankoh jointly led a coup which deposed President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah in 1998. After West African countries, led by Nigeria, intervened to restore Mr Kabbah, he was arrested, charged with treason and sentenced to death. But under the terms of a peace agreement with the RUF worked out in Togo last July, Sankoh received an amnesty and was invited to join the government. Mr Kabbah and his supporters have no reason to trust him to keep his word a second time and will want to be rid of him.</p> <p>The British government and its force commanders on the ground may advise a more circumspect approach when it comes to deciding the fate of the RUF leader. The evolving British strategy, as expressed by force commander Brigadier David Richards, seems to be a big push, fronted by the Sierra Leone army and backed by British and UN troops, to seize control of as much rebel-held territory as possible and so force a weakened and defeated RUF to agree to their terms.</p> <p>While this effort is in progress, the British may well want to keep Sankoh under wraps, pending a future war crimes trial. It may be suggested to him that if he were to collaborate now, this could be taken into consideration later.</p> <p>The UN special envoy, Oluyemi Adeniji, may take a different view. Mr Adeniji, backed by Liberia's president Charles Taylor (a long-time associate and backer of Sankoh) has been pressing for a ceasefire and return to the Togo peace process (which others believe is effectively defunct). Like it or not, it is argued, Sankoh appears to represent key factions in the civil war. As before, the agreement of these factions is needed if a lasting peace is to be secured.</p> <p>The UN is also mindful of the fate of the 347 UN personnel who are still being held hostage by RUF forces. Mr Taylor, who has an interest in retaining proxy control of the diamond fields, has warned that the hostages could suffer if the government counter-offensive is pursued. To make matters even more complicated, it remains unclear whether Sankoh actually controls the hostage-takers and whether, now that he has been captured, they will take any further notice of him. One possibility is that Sankoh and other captured rebels could be swapped for the UN hostages.</p> <p>In terms of international law, it is clear that Sankoh should be forced to answer for his many crimes, the depravity of which has shocked the world. But no international tribunal, such as those set up for Rwanda and the Balkans, currently exists for Sierra Leone. And the new, permanent International Criminal Court has yet to be launched, two years after its founding treaty was signed.</p> <p>The conflicting objectives, meanwhile, of the various powers-that-be in Freetown seem certain to complicate any decision about Sankoh's fate.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The last time Foday Sankoh, the leader of Sierra Leone's Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels, was arrested and charged with treason, he ended up as vice president of the country, in charge of its valuable diamond fields. He is unlikely to be so fortunate on this occasion. Sankoh was paraded naked through the streets of Freetown today after being captured, reportedly by pro-government soldiers backed by the British intervention force. His re-emergence, 10 days after he disappeared from his heavily guarded Freetown home put an end to speculation that he had been killed, had died of a heart attack, or had fled up-country to join his RUF fighters. But mystery continued to surround Sankoh's whereabouts during the intervening period. His disappearance closely followed the arrival of British special forces in Sierra Leone and the assertion of overall British direction of the UN and government anti-insurgency effort. Activity near his home by personnel attached to the US embassy in Freetown was also reported around the time he vanished. No explanation has yet emerged about the fate of his numerous bodyguards. The question now is what to do with Sankoh. People who crowded on to the streets of Freetown to celebrate his capture seemed to be in no doubt. \"The masses must decide,\" one resident was quoted as saying. \"He made the people of this country suffer for nine years...He is not fit to exist.\" Another onlooker said: \"We should kill that man today\". The Sierra Leone government to which Sankoh officially belongs may also be tempted to dispose of him as quickly as possible. Sankoh jointly led a coup which deposed President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah in 1998. After West African countries, led by Nigeria, intervened to restore Mr Kabbah, he was arrested, charged with treason and sentenced to death. But under the terms of a peace agreement with the RUF worked out in Togo last July, Sankoh received an amnesty and was invited to join the government. Mr Kabbah and his supporters have no reason to trust him to keep his word a second time and will want to be rid of him. The British government and its force commanders on the ground may advise a more circumspect approach when it comes to deciding the fate of the RUF leader. The evolving British strategy, as expressed by force commander Brigadier David Richards, seems to be a big push, fronted by the Sierra Leone army and backed by British and UN troops, to seize control of as much rebel-held territory as possible and so force a weakened and defeated RUF to agree to their terms. While this effort is in progress, the British may well want to keep Sankoh under wraps, pending a future war crimes trial. It may be suggested to him that if he were to collaborate now, this could be taken into consideration later. The UN special envoy, Oluyemi Adeniji, may take a different view. Mr Adeniji, backed by Liberia's president Charles Taylor (a long-time associate and backer of Sankoh) has been pressing for a ceasefire and return to the Togo peace process (which others believe is effectively defunct). Like it or not, it is argued, Sankoh appears to represent key factions in the civil war. As before, the agreement of these factions is needed if a lasting peace is to be secured. The UN is also mindful of the fate of the 347 UN personnel who are still being held hostage by RUF forces. Mr Taylor, who has an interest in retaining proxy control of the diamond fields, has warned that the hostages could suffer if the government counter-offensive is pursued. To make matters even more complicated, it remains unclear whether Sankoh actually controls the hostage-takers and whether, now that he has been captured, they will take any further notice of him. One possibility is that Sankoh and other captured rebels could be swapped for the UN hostages. In terms of international law, it is clear that Sankoh should be forced to answer for his many crimes, the depravity of which has shocked the world. But no international tribunal, such as those set up for Rwanda and the Balkans, currently exists for Sierra Leone. And the new, permanent International Criminal Court has yet to be launched, two years after its founding treaty was signed. The conflicting objectives, meanwhile, of the various powers-that-be in Freetown seem certain to complicate any decision about Sankoh's fate.",

It's a film of extreme violence, among both humans and dogs. The first third is set in the sordid, blood-steeped dog-fighting rings of low-life Mexico City, where slavering, snapping hounds hurl themselves at each other in ear-ripping combat. Even though the shots of the dog-fights are mercifully brief and ungloating, they are enough to unsettle you even if you're no dog lover (and after a week trying not to step on the micro-chihuahuas on the Croisette, festival-goers tend not to be). </p> <p>The dogs form a parallel to human life on the streets of Mexico City, where people all too easily revert to teeth-baring rage.

And finally, a dog-loving terrorist turned tramp and hitman prepares for his latest mission. </p> <p>Even at two hours, 33 minutes, there's barely a moment wasted. Inarritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga Jordan are dazzlingly adept storytellers; they've managed to shoehorn three genres coherently into one film. </p> <p>The first story is hard, low-life realism, shot in lurid colours and edited as a frenetic blur. The model's section is a cruel moral tale of the unexpected, with the tension cranked up mercilessly throughout; it is photographed as a picture of a smooth, upmarket world in which the real troubles go on beneath the surface (under the floorboards, in fact). The third story is pitched as a suspenseful psychological thriller. </p> <p>The whole is composed according to the Pulp Fiction principle of interlocking lives, all the while looping back and forth in time. Just occasionally you feel the contrivance, but there's never any sense that this is a film wrapped up in its own tentacles or just fiddling around with fancy plot diagrams, like Run Lola Run. It never loses the feel of the everyday. In the dogfights especially, Gonzalez Inarritu could almost be making an edgy, rap-rhythmed documentary, photographed by Rodrigo Prieto so that you can feel the grease, the grime and the panic. </p> <p>The dog fights mean that the film-makers are in for a hairy time trying to get the film shown in Britain, where the British Board of Film Classification comes down hard on any hint of cruelty to animals. One film that was unreleasable here for that very reason was Claire Denis's film about cockfighting, S'En Fout La Mort, which can be seen at the NFT next month. The fact that Denis's was a sombre art film with a semi-documentary edge could have been regarded as a mitigating factor. It would be harder to argue that case for Amores Perros, which, despite its authentic-looking realism, also has a high-thrills factor. The movie-makers claim that no dogs were hurt during filming, although it's hard to imagine quite how they managed that.

Government soldiers armed with rocket launchers and automatic rifles chased away the crowd and maintained a heavy presence in front of the defence compound. \"The masses must decide what to do with him,\" said SK Shyly, an engineer who drove to the compound. \"But I say he is not fit to exist. He made the people of this country suffer for nine years.\" RUF rebels acquired notoriety through their practice of hacking limbs off civilians, abducting boys and girls as sex slaves in a campaign of terror. Mr Sankoh was brought into the government and his troops were given a blanket amnesty in a desperate bid to end the 10-year-civil war. But that peace accord unravelled in recent weeks as rebels refused to disarm and seized hundreds of UN peacekeepers. It has become clear that the rebels are in no mood to give up diamond-producing areas under their control. Mr Sankoh's capture may have little bearing on events as his writ may not run over the commanders in the diamond areas in what is an anarchic situation. Late yesterday, 93 of the former captives were flown from the Liberian capital, Monrovia, to the Freetown airport at nearby Lungi on board a UN aircraft. Oluyemi Adeniji, the UN special representative to Sierra Leone, welcomed them back, saying their contribution to the peacekeeping mission would continue and that the mission would succeed. Seventy-nine were Zambians and 14 were Kenyans. While one came off the plane on crutches and at least two were bandaged, none appeared to be seriously injured. The remainder of the freed hostages are in the remote Liberian border town of Foya, but were expect to be flown to Monrovia, the Liberian capital, today. Their release was brokered by Charles Taylor, the Liberian president, who has close ties to the rebels. He is trying to win the release of the remaining 350 UN captives, most of whom are believed to be Zambian. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, President Clinton's special envoy to Africa, was planning to visit the region this week. But yesterday Sierra Leone's state-run radio announced he was not welcome because of recent statements he made expressing sympathy for the rebels. In Geneva, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees on Tuesday said 600 refugees from western Sierra Leone have fled to neighboring Guinea over the past three days, and aid workers are gearing up to accommodate as many as 25,000 people.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>Why are police complaints procedures in the news?</b> <br> Jack Straw has decided that the existing system of handling serious complaints against police officers is not up to scratch. He is to announce new proposals in a speech this morning to the Police Federation conference in Brighton, shortly before the publication of a consultation paper on the subject. <p><b>How does the complaints system work at the moment?</b><br> Members of the public can complain if they think a police officer has behaved incorrectly or unfairly. They can make a complaint about the conduct of a police officer towards them or can complain on someone else's behalf with their written authorisation. Recently the level of proof required in an investigation has changed from the criminal standard of \"beyond reasonable doubt\" to the lower standard of the \"balance of probabilities\", in line with normal employment practice. Allegations of assault, neglect of duty, breaches of the police and criminal evidence codes of practice and incivility are the most common complaints. Allegations of corrupt practice are, in contrast, relatively low.</p> <p><b>Why are there calls for change?</b><br> Under the present system, reformed in the wake of the1981 Brixton riots, police forces respond to complaints by setting up an internal investigation, under the supervision of the independent Police Complaints Authority. But only in very serious cases are officers drafted in from other forces to assist. Critics say that this approach lacks rigour and want a more transparent system to be introduced. They argue that there is a risk that officers won't really push to find out the truth when they are investigating their own colleagues. </p> <p><b>Why's this issue on the agenda now?</b><br> Last year's MacPherson inquiry into the way police officers handled the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence called for a review of the existing system of handling complaints. In response, Mr Straw appointed consultants KPMG to consider changes. They have backed reform and in today's speech the home secretary will aim to take the process forward, to take into account the many people who no longer trust the present system. </p> <p><b>What changes will be made?</b><br> Independent civilian investigators will be introduced to examine issues such as deaths in custody, shootings and allegations of corruption. This could pave the way for investigators from the customs, inland revenue, serious fraud office and the legal profession to take charge of inquiries, although police could retain responsibility for some investigations. The aim is to produce a system which everyone accepts as impartial.</p> <p><b>What do the police think about this?</b><br> Most police officers think that the existing system has merits. They claim that police officers are already subject to tight regulation and argue internal investigations provide the best way for forces to learn from their mistakes. Nonetheless, senior police figures say they will back the changes. They accept that reform is the only way for the police to win back public trust and also welcome the possibility that the new system will relieve hard-pressed police budgets of the cost of funding investigations.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Home Office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pca.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Police Complaints Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.police.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Police services of the UK</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.apa.police.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Association of Police Authorities</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/macpherson/\">Macpherson report - one year on: special report</a></p>",

How does the complaints system work at the moment? Members of the public can complain if they think a police officer has behaved incorrectly or unfairly. They can make a complaint about the conduct of a police officer towards them or can complain on someone else's behalf with their written authorisation. Recently the level of proof required in an investigation has changed from the criminal standard of \"beyond reasonable doubt\" to the lower standard of the \"balance of probabilities\", in line with normal employment practice. Allegations of assault, neglect of duty, breaches of the police and criminal evidence codes of practice and incivility are the most common complaints. Allegations of corrupt practice are, in contrast, relatively low. Why are there calls for change? Under the present system, reformed in the wake of the1981 Brixton riots, police forces respond to complaints by setting up an internal investigation, under the supervision of the independent Police Complaints Authority. But only in very serious cases are officers drafted in from other forces to assist. Critics say that this approach lacks rigour and want a more transparent system to be introduced. They argue that there is a risk that officers won't really push to find out the truth when they are investigating their own colleagues. Why's this issue on the agenda now? Last year's MacPherson inquiry into the way police officers handled the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence called for a review of the existing system of handling complaints. In response, Mr Straw appointed consultants KPMG to consider changes. They have backed reform and in today's speech the home secretary will aim to take the process forward, to take into account the many people who no longer trust the present system. What changes will be made? Independent civilian investigators will be introduced to examine issues such as deaths in custody, shootings and allegations of corruption. This could pave the way for investigators from the customs, inland revenue, serious fraud office and the legal profession to take charge of inquiries, although police could retain responsibility for some investigations. The aim is to produce a system which everyone accepts as impartial. What do the police think about this? Most police officers think that the existing system has merits. They claim that police officers are already subject to tight regulation and argue internal investigations provide the best way for forces to learn from their mistakes. Nonetheless, senior police figures say they will back the changes. They accept that reform is the only way for the police to win back public trust and also welcome the possibility that the new system will relieve hard-pressed police budgets of the cost of funding investigations.

      "body": "<p>Warner Village is to become the first big cinema chain in Britain to cater for the Bollywood market by dedicating screens in a Birmingham multiplex that opens in July. </p> <p> Ralf Ludemann of Warner Village said yesterday that six out of 30 screens would show exclusively Indian-made films. His company was able to do this only because of a clampdown on pirated videos of Bollywood films, he said. \"Until bodies like the Federation Against Copyright Theft toughened up on piracy recently, it was not feasible for multiplexes to compete with smuggled videos. </p> <p> \"Without the videos, there are fewer avenues to see these films, so people will come to the Warner Village.\" </p> <p> Bollywood is the popular term for the film industry based in the city of Bombay which makes 600 films a year, worth \u00a3750m worldwide. The UK is Bollywood's biggest export market, but audiences of the three-hour musicals have been restricted to videos, satellite TV or independent cine mas. There is one eight-screen Asian cinema in Birmingham's centre that seats 1,000, and another cinema in nearby Smethwick. But multiplex chains only occasionally hold screenings in places such as Wolverhampton, Leicester or Bolton. </p> <p> Warner Village said the Birmingham screens would be marketed specifically among the Asian community. In inner city Birmingham 70% of the population is black or Asian, and in the city as a whole there are more black and Asian under-18s than there are white under-18s. </p> <p> Mr Ludemann said: \"It's hard to tell if white audiences will come to the films on the back of mainstream hits like East is East. </p> <p> \"Bollywood films are subtitled and very long, with at least six dance intervals. But, if there is a demand, we will increase the number of Bollywood screens.\" </p> <p> Inderjit Dehal is director of the Birmingham Race Action Project,which campaigns for institutional change in the city. He said the multiplex was important for Asians. \"Birmingham will be Britain's first black city, but its infrastructure has stagnated, and blacks and Asians are sidelined from many leisure activities. This type of commercial initiative should set an example for a better ethnic balance in other areas like health and education.\" </p> <p> Raj Kaushal, editor of Snoop, an Asian monthly specialising in Bollywood, said the screens were good news if there was a sustainable market. \"Last year at least three Bollywood films entered the UK top 10. </p> <p> \"I'm all for Bollywood entering the mainstream, but it is tedious when fickle commercial ventures jump on the 'Asian cool' bandwagon. \"Next week the new thing could be 'Japanese cool'.\"</p>",

Ralf Ludemann of Warner Village said yesterday that six out of 30 screens would show exclusively Indian-made films. His company was able to do this only because of a clampdown on pirated videos of Bollywood films, he said. \"Until bodies like the Federation Against Copyright Theft toughened up on piracy recently, it was not feasible for multiplexes to compete with smuggled videos. \"Without the videos, there are fewer avenues to see these films, so people will come to the Warner Village.\" Bollywood is the popular term for the film industry based in the city of Bombay which makes 600 films a year, worth \u00a3750m worldwide. The UK is Bollywood's biggest export market, but audiences of the three-hour musicals have been restricted to videos, satellite TV or independent cine mas. There is one eight-screen Asian cinema in Birmingham's centre that seats 1,000, and another cinema in nearby Smethwick. But multiplex chains only occasionally hold screenings in places such as Wolverhampton, Leicester or Bolton. Warner Village said the Birmingham screens would be marketed specifically among the Asian community. In inner city Birmingham 70% of the population is black or Asian, and in the city as a whole there are more black and Asian under-18s than there are white under-18s. Mr Ludemann said: \"It's hard to tell if white audiences will come to the films on the back of mainstream hits like East is East. \"Bollywood films are subtitled and very long, with at least six dance intervals. But, if there is a demand, we will increase the number of Bollywood screens.\" Inderjit Dehal is director of the Birmingham Race Action Project,which campaigns for institutional change in the city. He said the multiplex was important for Asians. \"Birmingham will be Britain's first black city, but its infrastructure has stagnated, and blacks and Asians are sidelined from many leisure activities. This type of commercial initiative should set an example for a better ethnic balance in other areas like health and education.\" Raj Kaushal, editor of Snoop, an Asian monthly specialising in Bollywood, said the screens were good news if there was a sustainable market. \"Last year at least three Bollywood films entered the UK top 10. \"I'm all for Bollywood entering the mainstream, but it is tedious when fickle commercial ventures jump on the 'Asian cool' bandwagon. \"Next week the new thing could be 'Japanese cool'.\"",

      "bodyText": "At the moment, anyone can call themselves a social worker, whatever their training or expertise. But soon the job title could become a protected term used only by staff who have completed a degree in professional social work. The proposal, part of a push to raise standards, is contained in a document outlining benchmark academic targets designed to shape the future of socia work degree courses. The quality assurance agency for higher education (QAA), proposer of the benchmarks due to be implemented later this year, says the setting up of a general social care council (GSCC) and statutory regulation of some social care staff may lead to \"the terms social work and/or social worker becoming protected titles\". There are currently only 60,000 qualified social work posts out of a social care workforce of more than a million.

      "bodyText": "MI5 was plunged into disarray last night after the disclosure that its former head, Dame Stella Rimington, has written her memoirs about her experience in charge of the security service. The disclosure could not have come at a worst time for MI5. It is embroiled in a series of legal battles against the media, including the Guardian and Observer newspapers, to prevent publication of its activities. David Shayler, the renegade MI5 officer now living in Paris, is certain to seize on the disclosure to press his demands that he should be allowed to return to Britain to reveal his allegations of malpractice against the agency. The government is also trying to clamp down on revelations about the activities of army intelligence units in Northern Ireland during Dame Stella's time in the security service. The Home Office said last night that the former MI5 chief had submitted a text of her memoirs \"according to the rules\" earlier this year. A spokeswoman said both Dame Stella and the government were concerned that nothing should be published that would damage national security. The Home Office denied reports in the Sun newspaper that a court injunction was being drawn up preventing her from publishing the book. The Home Office was unable to comment on reports that government lawyers were scrambling to stop the disclosure of any secrets with a high court injunction, amid reports that Dame Stella could make as much as \u00a31m from her memoirs. \"The government's overriding concern is that nothing should appear that is damaging to national security,\" the spokeswoman said. \"I understand that Dame Stella shares that view and that is why she submitted the text in accordance with the rules and it is being considered. \"Obviously if there is material in the text which is damaging, the government will be talking to her and telling her that.\" Later the Home Office said: \"There are no plans for a high court injunction. It would be inappropriate to talk about legal action when discussions are ongoing under the normal procedures.\" Dame Stella told reporters: \"Yes, I am writing a book. I have written a draft which I have submitted to the relevant government authorities. \"It is a personal memoir. It is not my intention to disclose any information of a sensitive nature.\" The last time a former MI5 chief published his memoirs was in the 1950s when Percy Sillitoe wrote Cloak Without Dagger. In the 80s the Thatcher government spent millions of pounds in a vain attempt to prevent a former MI5 officer, Peter Wright, from publishing his memoirs, Spycatcher. Dame Stella and MI5 will be open to the charge of hypocrisy if it allows her memoirs to be published when the security service is trying to suppress information about its workings. The spymaster ran MI5 during the height of the terrorist threat from the IRA. She was the first woman to be appointed head of MI5 and was also the first to be photographed and officially named. In retirement she earns an estimated \u00a360,000 a year from her directorships of Marks and Spencer and British Gas. She also draws a sizeable government pension based on the \u00a390,000-a-year salary she earned at MI5. News of her proposed book follows a stream of similar publications by men holding sensitive positions. The Gulf war commander, General Sir Peter de la Billi\u00e8re, published a book relating to SAS operations during the 1991 Gulf war. SAS sergeant Andy McNab also caused controversy when he wrote his best selling book Bravo Two Zero about the exploits of his patrol behind enemy lines during the same conflict.",

The BBC contests the claims, and said yesterday it was considering the tribunal's ruling on disclosure of personnel files: it has the right of appeal.",

      "bodyText": "The Israeli leader Ehud Barak, after agreeing to the transfer of the village of Abu Dis to Palestinian control, has abruptly reversed the decision, insisting that the handover must wait until peace is restored in the West Bank and Gaza. The US envoy, Dennis Ross, met the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, yesterday to discuss a peace process which has yielded almost no material gains and which is now the principal source of the frustration which is fuelling the clashes. In Ramallah, Israeli soldiers trained machine guns over geraniums in the window boxes of the City Inn hotel yesterday; uninvited guests staring down hundreds of rioters who had ignored calls from the Palestinian leadership to end the violent protests. Three Palestinians were killed and at least 320 injured, and 15 Israeli soldiers were wounded on Monday, which saw the worst explosion of violence in nearly four years. Israeli forces resorted to live ammunition in pitched battles with Palestinian protesters - and with the police, who were under instructions to stand aside while people vented their anger. At an Israeli enclave in Palestinian-run Bethlehem, police formed a cordon to force back the stone throwers. \"Down with the olive branch, long live the rifle,\" protesters chanted as they withdrew. Yesterday, however, Mr Ross warned that the peace talks have no hope of advancing unless peace is restored. \"Both sides are working hard to calm the environment, and that is the key to restoring calm,\" Mr Ross said. \"It is also a key to being able to move this peace process forward.\" Israeli officials are fond of accusing Mr Arafat of manipulating street protests as a means of putting pressure on the negotiations. But as yesterday's protests underscored, popular anger can not be switched on - or off - at will. Although Palestinian leaders were more anxious to rein in demonstrators after Monday's venting of rage, the protesters at Ramallah yesterday were in no mind to heed them. \"We don't follow orders from anyone,\" said Ali Abu Khader, 19, who was catching his breath between rounds of stone throwing. \"Mr Arafat wants to protect people but he doesn't understand that this is a popular revolution. \"When my brother is killed or in prison how can I obey orders?\" Outside the City Inn hotel, scene of the worst clashes on Monday, hundreds of Palestinian police were called out yesterday to do just that.

From time to time, the Palestinian police would step in, ambling down the hill to the stone-throwing youths and leading them away by the elbows. Marwan Barghouti, a Fatah leader and a member of the Palestine legislative council, admitted the police had little stomach for keeping order - especially when several of their number had been shot and wounded by Israeli soldiers on Monday. He also justified Monday's exchange of fire with soldiers, saying the Palestinian police were providing \"moral support\" for the demonstrators in their battle with Israeli security troops. Other Palestinians say the forces propelling the protesters to violence are more complicated. They argue that much of the anger vented on Monday and yesterday was against Mr Arafat's corrupt and incompetent authority, which has disappointed Palestinian aspirations, both in the peace process, and in domestic governance. \"These people believe they should start a new intifada,\" said Kanaan al-Jamal, who works for the Palestinian negotiations department. \"People now realise they must be a part of the peace process, and that if they throw stones it might strengthen the negotiations.\"",

The fine, the largest handed out by the authority, was imposed after Mr Evans twice supported Mr Livingstone - who later won the position as an independent candidate - on air weeks before the election. He pledged \u00a3200,000 to the Livingstone campaign, although he did not hand over any money. Richard Hooper, chairman of the authority, which licenses and regulates commercial radio, said Virgin was guilty of a \"critical failure\". It is the fifth time that Virgin has been fined by the authority since it began broadcasting in 1993. Mr Evans did not comment yesterday, but Virgin said it accepted the decision. It pointed out, however, that the rules on political broadcasting had been altered only recently, and said the mistake had been due to a misunderstanding. In its ruling yesterday the authority said that Mr Evans had breached the rules governing broadcasters' impartiality during his breakfast show on March 21. Mr Evans first aired his support for Mr Livingstone \"at length\" after the 8am news and again an hour later, the authority said. Mr Hooper said: \"This broadcast was a flagrant breach of the long-standing rules surrounding political impartiality, made worse by the fact that the broadcast took place in the run-up to that most sensitive of political events, an election.\" The authority said that the fine would have been greater had Virgin not immediately apologised after the event. Virgin confirmed yesterday that Mr Evans had not yet met his cash pledge to Mr Livingstone's campaign. A meeting has been arranged for next Tuesday with Mr Livingstone's staff to discuss how Mr Evans might be able to support the mayor in future.",

      "body": "<p>A heavily-pregnant Cherie Booth yesterday proved herself a thorn in the government's side as she led an impassioned legal defence of the need to balance parenthood with working life. </p> <p>In her last high court appearance before the birth of her fourth child, due next week, the prime minister's barrister wife declared on behalf of the TUC that government policy on parental leave was unlawful. </p> <p>Ms Booth, who recently hinted strongly that she wanted her husband to take paternity leave when their baby arrived, spoke forcefully of \"allowing parents to strike a balance between work and family rights\" in a row over a new entitlement to parental leave. </p> <p>The regulations, which last year brought an EU directive into British law, allow up to 13 weeks' unpaid leave to mothers and fathers of children under five. </p> <p>But, under pressure from employers' organisations, the government restricted this right to parents of children born after December 15 last year. </p> <p>The TUC, bringing its case against the trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers, claimed the privilege should also have been made available to all existing parents who had children under five on that date. </p> <p>The legal battle highlights continuing tensions within Mr Blair's administration between the urge to keep business sweet and promoting family-friendly working.

      "bodyText": "A heavily-pregnant Cherie Booth yesterday proved herself a thorn in the government's side as she led an impassioned legal defence of the need to balance parenthood with working life. In her last high court appearance before the birth of her fourth child, due next week, the prime minister's barrister wife declared on behalf of the TUC that government policy on parental leave was unlawful. Ms Booth, who recently hinted strongly that she wanted her husband to take paternity leave when their baby arrived, spoke forcefully of \"allowing parents to strike a balance between work and family rights\" in a row over a new entitlement to parental leave. The regulations, which last year brought an EU directive into British law, allow up to 13 weeks' unpaid leave to mothers and fathers of children under five. But, under pressure from employers' organisations, the government restricted this right to parents of children born after December 15 last year. The TUC, bringing its case against the trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers, claimed the privilege should also have been made available to all existing parents who had children under five on that date. The legal battle highlights continuing tensions within Mr Blair's administration between the urge to keep business sweet and promoting family-friendly working. The government has also come under strong pressure, not least from its own female backbenchers, to provide some form of payment for parental leave amid warnings that few parents - particularly fathers - will otherwise take up the new right. Ms Booth, appearing with a team of three women barristers \"catering for any eventuality\", said the government's restriction had the effect of cutting off 2.7m parents from claiming the extra time with their children that was theirs by right. She said it created a \"two-tier system of parental leave; those parents fortunate in having children born after December 15 and other parents with similar age children [born] before that\". Tony Blair chose this week to reveal that, while he would scale back his official workload, he would not be taking paternity leave for the birth of the couple's fourth child. Instead, he is expected to hop up and down stairs between home and office, cutting his working hours but by no means handing over his duties completely. Yesterday Ms Booth told the court that it was impossible to put a price on the loss to parents who miss out on time with their children. \"What they are losing is the right to family life,\" she said. \"That is very difficult to quantify in monetary terms.\" Similarly unquantifiable were \"the benefits to employers of a family-friendly policy: a more contented workforce, a more committed workforce\". Ms Booth told Lord Bingham, the lord chief justice, and Mr Justice Morison - who are not expected to pass judgment for a week - that to include the parents of children under five born before December 15 would cost employers about \u00a350m on top of the projected \u00a342.18m over five years. These figures were \"small beer\" compared with the \u00a32.5bn cost of the minimum wage regulations, said Ms Booth. The cost to employees of taking unpaid leave would be \u00a3109m in lost income, much greater than the cost to employers. The government's claim that the burden on employers was already excessive was an exaggeration, she said. Jonathan Crow, counsel for the trade and industry secretary, said the EU directive referred to the right of workers to parental leave \"on the grounds of the birth or adoption of a child\". Therefore the entitlement to leave was triggered by the specific event of birth or adoption, not by merely having responsibility for a child, he said. The TUC is likely to appeal if it loses the case, and DTI sources indicated the government might do the same if defeated. TUC campaigners fear a worst-case scenario which would see the decision passed to the European court of justice, effectively \"kicking the whole thing into the long grass\", according to one source.",

      "bodyText": "New medical evidence has debunked the myth among recreational drug users that small amounts of ecstasy and cocaine are safe after two studies published today found that even moderate doses of the drugs have serious and long-lasting mental or physical side effects. German researchers discovered that ecstasy could reduce intelligence, while an American study suggested that taking a small amount of cocaine could cause blood clots and might explain the high rate of heart attacks among users. Researchers at Aachen University found that regular users of ecstasy performed far worse in mental tasks than those who had never taken the drug. They concluded that the effects may be \"cumulative and irreversible\". They tested the alertness, attention span, memory and general intelligence of 84 people - a third of whom were regular users of ecstasy and cannabis, a third regular users of cannabis and a third who did not take any drugs. The researchers found that ecstasy users got significantly worse scores in complex memory tests, although their alertness was not affected. The results, published in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, suggested that ecstasy could lead to a \"cognitive decline\" in otherwise healthy young people, particularly if combined with cannabis, by having toxic effects on brain cells, particularly those involved in the serotonin neurotransmitter system, which might be irreversible. Researchers at the Pittsburgh University medical centre who monitored the heart rates and blood chemicals of 14 young people for two hours after the subjects were given a small dose of cocaine found that the drug slightly increased heart rate and blood pressure, with a more significant increase in the chemicals aiding the formation of clots. William Wagner, who led the research published in the journal Heart, said: \"The risk of thrombosis, similar to the risk of sudden cardiac death, is real and may affect even the first time user of small quantities of the drug.\"",

Richard Moore, the clinical director of the transplant centre at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, predicted \"enormous\" demand for the procedure.

After undergoing the transplants on average 11 months ago, Mr Shapiro said they showed \"complete control\" of a chemical marker which signals damage from high blood sugar. \"There has been clear and dramatic improvement in quality of life for the patients and no evidence of rejection,\" said the surgeon. The only problem he foresaw was meeting the expected demand from diabetics for the transplant, which is a simple procedure involving injection of the cells into the vein and does not need to be done by a surgeon.

He acknowledged that getting a sufficient supply of islets was a problem, but said he thought it could be overcome in about five years by cloning techniques. Until now, surgeons have unsuccessfully focused on trying to transplant the entire pancreas into a diabetes patient.

      "bodyText": "Jack Straw, the home secretary, threatened a shake-up of Britain's obscenity laws after a landmark high court ruling yesterday that the film censors were wrong to ban the sale of double X explicit hardcore porn videos in licensed adult sex shops in Britain. Mr Justice Hooper dismissed the test case brought by Andreas Whittam Smith's British Board of Film Classification, saying that the risk of the seven videos involved being seen by and causing harm to children was, on the present evidence, insignificant. The BBFC last night refused to comment in detail on its defeat but when it started the case last September, Mr Whittam Smith said that failure would have \"fundamental implications\" for all its decisions on classifying videos and films, including those involving unacceptable levels of violence. The judgment reinforces the legal view that adults should not be prevented from access to explicit material just because it might be harmful to children if it fell into their hands. As TV \"decency\" campaigners claimed that the decision would \"open the floodgates to hardcore pornography\", Mr Straw said he would, if necessary, bring in new legislation to sort out the current \"shambles\" of the obscenity laws. \"The home secretary believes that the situation is un satisfactory and it will be considered carefully whether additional steps can be taken to protect children from exposure to this sexually explicit material. Any such changes may require legislation,\" a Home Office statement said. Mr Straw made clear his anger at the decision and said that he had personally intervened to replace the BBFC acting president, Lord Birkett, with Mr Whittam Smith to stop the licensing of such \"stronger\" videos to be sold in adult sex shops. The target of his anger is the 1984 Video Recordings Act, introduced as a private member's bill to curb the alleged excesses of \"video nasties\". The case centres on a decision by the independent Video Appeals Committee to overturn the BBFC's refusal to give a special R18 certificate to seven \"hardcore\" videos produced by Sheptonhurst Ltd and Prime Time (Shifnal) for restricted sale in Britain's 80 licensed sex shops. The committee, which is chaired by John Wood, a former deputy director of public prosecutions, includes the novelist Fay Weldon. The film censors said the seven videos - called Horny Catbabe, Nympho Nurse Nancy, TV Sex, Office Tart, Carnival International Version (trailer), Wet Nurses 2 Continental Version and Miss Nude International Continental Version - should not be licensed unless \"all shots of penetration by penis, hand or dildo as well as shots of a penis being masturbated or taken into a woman's mouth\" were removed. Lord Lester of Herne Hill, for the BBFC, told the high court that if the videos were allowed to be sold all hardcore material would have to be licensed unless it was criminally obscene or could be shown to cause \"devastating harm to more than a minority of children and young people\". But Mr Justice Hooper said the assessment by the Video Appeals Committee that the risk to children was insignificant was a reasonable conclusion. Greg Hurlstone, a director of Prime Time, said he was delighted but insisted his US-made videos were double X rather than triple X productions, as they featured consensual penetrative sex without close-ups and no ejaculation or illegal practices. Last night Clive Sullivan, a consultant to Sheptonhurst, insisted that the decision would not unleash a flood of European triple X hardcore films: \"There are still limits which will be applied,\" he said. But John Beyer of the National Viewers and Listeners' Association called for new legislation to clamp down on porn. \"This will open the floodgates to hardcore pornography,\" he said.",

The overseas business is to be called International Power while the UK business is to be renamed Npower. </p> <p>The group's pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 fell from \u00a3571m to \u00a3514m, largely reflecting the sale of the Drax power station. However the underlying results, which included a near doubling of international profits to \u00a3191m, pleased the market, leaving the shares 45p higher at 340p. </p> <p>National Power's chairman, Sir John Collins, said targets set 12 months ago after \"a very eventful period\" in the company's history had largely been achieved. </p> <p>\"The nature of the UK business has been transformed during the course of the year,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Most significantly, exposure in generation has been greatly reduced. The group, which issued dividend warnings in November and April, ended the year paying 15p a share, against 28.6p the previous year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "National Power yesterday cleared the way for the planned demerger of its British and international operations by announcing exceptional charges totalling \u00a31.37bn. The value of interests in Pakistan, Australia, Spain and Thailand have been written down by \u00a3246m to bring them in line with market conditions. It has written down the value of a long-term electricity contract by \u00a3200m after the fall in electricity prices and also reduced the book value of older generation assets. The rest of the exceptional charge was made up by previously announced provisions in connection with over-priced long-term gas supply contracts and a \u00a3334m one-off payment to secure changes in other gas supply contracts. However, the exceptional charge was offset by a \u00a31.3bn gain from the sale of the group's Drax, Eggborough and Killingholme power stations. National Power announced in November last year that it planned to relist its British and international operations as separate companies under new top management teams. The overseas business is to be called International Power while the UK business is to be renamed Npower. The group's pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 fell from \u00a3571m to \u00a3514m, largely reflecting the sale of the Drax power station. However the underlying results, which included a near doubling of international profits to \u00a3191m, pleased the market, leaving the shares 45p higher at 340p. National Power's chairman, Sir John Collins, said targets set 12 months ago after \"a very eventful period\" in the company's history had largely been achieved. \"The nature of the UK business has been transformed during the course of the year,\" he said. \"Most significantly, exposure in generation has been greatly reduced. The group, which issued dividend warnings in November and April, ended the year paying 15p a share, against 28.6p the previous year.",

But it is unclear whether this had been agreed or was an attempt kick into action those governments providing the bulk of the UN peacekeepers - India, Jordan, and Bangladesh - who have so far firmly resisted any change in their mandate. The increase in the number of troops under him certainly gives him the opportunity to make a serious impact. He is in charge of 700 paratroopers deployed in and around Lungi airport and Freetown, and 40 SAS soldiers engaged in surveillance and intelligence missions deep in the Sierra Leone countryside.

As such he is one of the new breed of senior British officers engaged in what the government calls \"defence diplomacy\" - backing up diplomatic activity and military advice with an effective deterrent force. By all accounts, he has succeeded in his key mission in Sierra Leone - to restore the confidence of the Kabbah government and the multinational UN force.

Shares in the Oxford-based company - priced at \u00a310 on flotation - climbed nearly 10% to a record high of \u00a339.12 after it announced a 22% rise in first quarter revenues to \u00a32.5m and an 80% increase in product shipment. However, net losses widened to \u00a35.6m, with further heavy investment in product development, staff and manufacturing centres expected. The latest share price increase values Bookham at \u00a34.6bn and places it in pole position to move into the FTSE 100 when the next quarterly changes are determined on June 7. Based on Monday's closing price, Bookham would take the place of either Baltimore Technologies, Thus or Kingston Communications, which have suffered from the sell-off of technology shares since entering the index in March. Bookham chief executive Andrew Rickman, above, speaking publicly about the group's financial prospects for the first time, predicted future trading would be \"strong\" with several new product launches boosting second-half figures. He also reiterated his aim to build an \"optical Intel\". Bookham has a dual Nasdaq listing and the rules of the US Securities and Exchange Commission have forbidden Mr Rickman from commenting publicly on the flotation. He and his wife own al most 25% of the company, a stake that is valued at about \u00a31.1bn. The startling performance of Bookham shares has been driven by investor demand for a technology that uses light to transmit data, catering to the needs of high-speed internet and telecoms networks. It uses what it claims is a \"unique\" manufacturing technique to build fibre-optic cables.",

The consideration is to be in cash, minus an adjustment for net working capital of around \u00a34m, and is likely to be effected in June. The estate comprises 183 pubs, which were put up for sale in February. In the financial year to September 1999, the business had sales of \u00a364.4m with an operating profit of \u00a314.6m.</p> <p><strong>The dot.com prince</strong><br> Saudi Arabian prince Alwaleed bin Talal said yesterday that he had invested $1bn in 15 US companies, including six internet firms and two telecoms companies. The prince's Kingdom Holding Company put $50m each in Amazon.com, eBay, Internet Capital, Priceline.com, InfoSpace Inc and Doubleclick, as well as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, McDonald's, Walt Disney, Ford, Gillette and Procter &amp; Gamble. </p> <p>The new investments raised the value of the prince's technology, media and telecommunications portfolio to $7.8bn. </p> <p><strong>Rolls wins \u00a380m US order</strong><br>British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce has won a $120m (\u00a380m) order for its Trent engines. The engines were ordered by US-based International Lease Financial Corporation, a subsidiary of American International Group, and will power three Airbus Industrie A340-600 aircraft. Deliveries are scheduled to begin in June 2002. </p> <p>ILFC is the largest of several companies which supply aircraft to airlines on lease. The order brings the total number of firm and optional orders for Trent-powered A350-500 and 600 aircraft to 129 globally, and the total value of Rolls-Royce orders announced this year to nearly $5.5bn. <strong>$1bn more for BCCI creditors.</strong></p> <p>Creditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) were repaid another $1bn (\u00a3625m) yesterday, taking total compensation since the bank's collapse in July 1991 to about 60p in the pound. </p> <p>Liquidators Deloitte and Touche said 70,000 creditors - including those who deposited funds with BCCI - may receive 75% of what they were owed, although the final settlement will depend on various legal actions, including a \u00a31bn-plus case against the Bank of England. </p> <p><strong>Specie substitute</strong></p> <p> Charles Darwin, the Victorian originator of the doctrine of the survival of the fittest, is to feature on new \u00a310 notes, the Bank of England announces today. Darwin's portrait will replace that of his contemporary, Charles Dickens, on the notes, which will be similar to the new \u00a320 notes in incorporating extra security devices to combat counterfeiting.</p>",

The consideration is to be in cash, minus an adjustment for net working capital of around \u00a34m, and is likely to be effected in June. The estate comprises 183 pubs, which were put up for sale in February. In the financial year to September 1999, the business had sales of \u00a364.4m with an operating profit of \u00a314.6m. The dot.com prince Saudi Arabian prince Alwaleed bin Talal said yesterday that he had invested $1bn in 15 US companies, including six internet firms and two telecoms companies. The prince's Kingdom Holding Company put $50m each in Amazon.com, eBay, Internet Capital, Priceline.com, InfoSpace Inc and Doubleclick, as well as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, McDonald's, Walt Disney, Ford, Gillette and Procter &amp; Gamble. The new investments raised the value of the prince's technology, media and telecommunications portfolio to $7.8bn. Rolls wins \u00a380m US order British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce has won a $120m (\u00a380m) order for its Trent engines. The engines were ordered by US-based International Lease Financial Corporation, a subsidiary of American International Group, and will power three Airbus Industrie A340-600 aircraft. Deliveries are scheduled to begin in June 2002. ILFC is the largest of several companies which supply aircraft to airlines on lease. The order brings the total number of firm and optional orders for Trent-powered A350-500 and 600 aircraft to 129 globally, and the total value of Rolls-Royce orders announced this year to nearly $5.5bn. $1bn more for BCCI creditors. Creditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) were repaid another $1bn (\u00a3625m) yesterday, taking total compensation since the bank's collapse in July 1991 to about 60p in the pound. Liquidators Deloitte and Touche said 70,000 creditors - including those who deposited funds with BCCI - may receive 75% of what they were owed, although the final settlement will depend on various legal actions, including a \u00a31bn-plus case against the Bank of England. Specie substitute Charles Darwin, the Victorian originator of the doctrine of the survival of the fittest, is to feature on new \u00a310 notes, the Bank of England announces today. Darwin's portrait will replace that of his contemporary, Charles Dickens, on the notes, which will be similar to the new \u00a320 notes in incorporating extra security devices to combat counterfeiting.",

      "body": "<p>It is easy to see why Salman Rushdie, Martin Amis and a host of other writers have fallen in love with New York. Like a femme fatale, it is irresistably compelling. With every generation comes a new wave of hopefuls: small-town escapees, European refugees, disaffected Londoners. Once here, few are not entranced. Suddenly the rest of the world seems like an unbearable backwater. After a year of living here while researching my next book, I still look around me with a sense of wonderment. I think I understand what a citizen from ancient Athens must have felt when seeing the might of Rome for the first time.</p> <p>The New Yorker writer, EB White, once compared the city to a poem, \"whose magic is comprehensible to millions of permanent residents - but whose full meaning will always remain elusive\". But the magic is by no means pure. The energy that New York exudes is as much the light of extinguished souls as it is the spark of individual enterprise. And while the full meaning of the city may prove elusive, all New Yorkers are painfully aware that it remains an intractable mass of contradictions. It is not just the extremes of wealth and poverty living side by side. It is as though every condition is locked in a struggle with its opposite, fixing New York in a state of permanent tension. Tolerance vies with racism, social mobility with elitism, sophistication with insecurity, efficiency with corruption, philanthropy with excess. Neither will yield to the other which is one reason New York defies definition.</p> <p>It might sound strange to describe New Yorkers as insecure when they delight so much in the cult of success. The display of wealth here, especially new wealth, is indeed wonderfully frank, from the super-long limousines which clog up the roads, to the voluptuous fur coats that adorn both men and women. LA has the Oscars once a year, but it's Oscar night every night in New York. Even something relatively unimportant like a black tie gala at the New York Metropolitan Opera House means couture ball gowns and real jewellery.</p> <p>I went to one for the American Ballet Theatre last week and saw two society hostesses almost have a heart attack because the designer had made them the same dresses. The \"pink dress affair\" buzzed through the audience like a 19th century scandal. In New York, appearance is a form of currency, or at the very least a calling card. One must look wealthy in order to be recognised as a person of worth.</p> <p>In a sense the whole city is an an audience and, from time to time, someone will stand up and announce, \"Last year I made $1,000,000, but this year I'm going to make $10,000,000,\" while every body applauds, each drawing hope and inspiration from the example. New York magazine, the weekly bible for Manhattanites, features a hilarious real estate section whose sole purpose is to spotlight very rich people buying very expensive homes.</p> <p>However, the cult of success is inextricably linked to its malevolent doppelganger, the cult of celebrity. The two combined have had an insidious affect on social mores such as courtesy, fairness and inclusion. To be a celebrity here is to enjoy the most craven and undisguised fawning. Unlike the British press, American newspapers handle literary figures with kid gloves, as if they were national treasures. In general, these manifestations of mass sycophancy are so crude that it almost makes the British envy of success seem attractive. Life is vastly different for the celebrity. Restaurants will always find a table, most services become free or ridiculously cheap, there is no such thing as a wait, invitations to anything and everything pour in. No one is ever rude or says no to a celebrity. A successful hairdresser told me recently that he barely breaks even because he dare not charge his more famous clients. Interestingly, celebrity is relative and highly local in New York. A famous person from another country counts for nothing unless he or she also succeeds here. I once saw Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary, try in vain to catch his waiter's eye while film stars Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger nearby were mobbed with attention.</p> <p>Just a couple of blocks away from my apartment, there is a restaurant called Moomba. I am told the food is so-so, and from the outside the decor looks distinctly ordinary. Its chief attraction is the VIP room where celebrities can dine in their own little corner, safely tucked away from the gawping hoi-polloi. A bouncer stands outside in front of a velvet rope, presumably to deter pushy nobodies.</p> <p>I can't understand why anyone except a masochist with a desire to be humiliated would frequent such a place. I suppose a certain celebrity might go to have his or her ego boosted but in a normal world we would feel sorry for such people and hardly admire them. In New York one man's fame stems from another's mortification.</p> <p>The consequence of this adoration of the celebrities is that to be ordinary is to be treated at times as though less than human. My fianc\u00e9 once joined a group of friends in a live audience in front of David Letterman. Not only were they herded about like cattle, they were talked to as if they were cattle. Such contempt simply for being ordinary.</p> <p>It is said that LA welcomes unknowns because today's unknown is tomorrow's discovery. New York, on the other hand, regards them as pests who won't go away. Both perceptions are probably exaggerated. However, I remember when I first arrived in New York, having an interview with a senior editor at a literary magazine which ended in farce. It was a boiling hot day and I arrived for a lunch appointment dishevelled and unnerved by the intense humidity. The editor looked up at me from his desk, smiled distantly, and said that he was too busy for lunch and it would have to be rescheduled. He then carried on writing and, humbly, I left.</p> <p>Yet New Yorkers not only revel in the status quo, they participate in their own humiliation. The clubs, naturally, have rules; some will accept Jews, blacks, and self-described homosexuals, some will not. But many of the co-ops, which constitute the majority of affordable and attractive New York housing, are also segregated. A co-op is a residential building owned by all the lessees; it is run by an elected board who have the right to determine who can buy an apartment. It is so routine for buyers to be rejected by boards that no one complains. Snobbery reigns supreme. I did not believe the stories about covert racism or social black-balling until I saw it for myself. For brief time, my fianc\u00e9 and I toyed with the idea of buying a place, so I contacted Stephen, the broker we had used for our rented flat. We wanted to live downtown, I told Stephen, in a pre-war building.</p> <p>He was disarmingly honest about the co-op process, and even went so far as to list which buildings accept Jews and non-whites, and which do not. \"But you won't have a problem getting past the board,\" he said, \"because you are Wasps.\" I am in fact Jewish. We decided to rent after that.</p> <p>As far as I know, such naked exclusionary tactics do not exist in London, my other home town. Nor is there the same frenzy of consumption and self-congratulation. It may be that the worst is yet to come, and London is merely catching up to New York's excesses. But then it is not ruled by the City to the same extent that the stock exchange powers New York. \"Believe me,\" said an editor at New York magazine, when I told him that everybody wants to move to New York. \"If the Nasdaq or the Dow Jones dropped 500 points, Salman Rushdie and Martin Amis would move elsewhere.\"</p> <p>Such impermanence is the great irony and, of all New York's contradictions, perhaps the biggest. What seems to be creative energy is often just feverish activity inside a ballooning bubble. New York is like a Potemkin Village, its inhabitants mere imports for the day. VS Pritchett despised the deracination of New Yorkers. \"There is no place where newness is so continuously pursued,\" he wrote. \"The past is a shame. It must be wrong. New York lives in the present because it is real estate. It has been more for sale than any other city I can think of.\"</p> <p>However, the real threat to New York's predominance is not the instability of its wealth, but the momentum of its own success. The city is in danger of becoming the Monaco of America. The more New York attracts the famous and the established, and celebrates the successful at the expense of the striving, the more it poisons its own creative pool. If the pendulum continues to swing in favour of the have-it-alls, the extraordinary tension which sustains this city will collapse.</p> <p><b>. . . and the Americans who love London</b></p> <p><b> Warren Hoge, London bureau chief, New York Times</b></p> <p>\"London appeals to New Yorkers with a certain interest in creative life, in cities. For me, the attraction is built around theatre: I used to come each fall to see whatever the new David Hare play was. As for the underground - well, I grew up on the New York subway system, and this is Valhalla compared to that. When people ask if I miss New York, I say: I'm a real New Yorker, but the one place I don't miss New York is London.\"</p> <p><b> Harriet Gugenheim, Film company executive</b></p> <p>\"I can't see myself leaving now. I enjoy visiting America, but it's very small-minded. I like the access to the rest of the world you have in Europe - and the feeling that you don't have to worry about being mugged. The one thing that makes me want to leave London? Property prices.\"</p> <p><b> Rafael Lago, President, American Intercontinental University</b></p> <p>\"They say the British can be unwelcoming, but it's all to do with attitude: if you're determined to find people unfriendly, they will be unfriendly. There's also a feeling of safety in London that is unlike any other city I've visited. Eventually I guess I'll have to go back but if right now I were to receive a call telling me I had to return, I'd be very disappointed. I've fallen in love with this city.\"</p> <p><b> Jennifer Waddell, Graphic designer</b></p> <p>\"I'm attracted to the ease of living in London. Transport is convenient - it makes the pub more enjoyable when you don't have to drive home afterwards. It seems generally safer here as well. Some people find Londoners unfriendly; I like that they generally keep to themselves. But then again, it's expensive and dirty.\"</p>",

I once saw Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary, try in vain to catch his waiter's eye while film stars Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger nearby were mobbed with attention. Just a couple of blocks away from my apartment, there is a restaurant called Moomba. I am told the food is so-so, and from the outside the decor looks distinctly ordinary. Its chief attraction is the VIP room where celebrities can dine in their own little corner, safely tucked away from the gawping hoi-polloi. A bouncer stands outside in front of a velvet rope, presumably to deter pushy nobodies. I can't understand why anyone except a masochist with a desire to be humiliated would frequent such a place. I suppose a certain celebrity might go to have his or her ego boosted but in a normal world we would feel sorry for such people and hardly admire them. In New York one man's fame stems from another's mortification. The consequence of this adoration of the celebrities is that to be ordinary is to be treated at times as though less than human. My fianc\u00e9 once joined a group of friends in a live audience in front of David Letterman. Not only were they herded about like cattle, they were talked to as if they were cattle. Such contempt simply for being ordinary. It is said that LA welcomes unknowns because today's unknown is tomorrow's discovery. New York, on the other hand, regards them as pests who won't go away. Both perceptions are probably exaggerated. However, I remember when I first arrived in New York, having an interview with a senior editor at a literary magazine which ended in farce. It was a boiling hot day and I arrived for a lunch appointment dishevelled and unnerved by the intense humidity. The editor looked up at me from his desk, smiled distantly, and said that he was too busy for lunch and it would have to be rescheduled. He then carried on writing and, humbly, I left. Yet New Yorkers not only revel in the status quo, they participate in their own humiliation. The clubs, naturally, have rules; some will accept Jews, blacks, and self-described homosexuals, some will not. But many of the co-ops, which constitute the majority of affordable and attractive New York housing, are also segregated. A co-op is a residential building owned by all the lessees; it is run by an elected board who have the right to determine who can buy an apartment. It is so routine for buyers to be rejected by boards that no one complains. Snobbery reigns supreme. I did not believe the stories about covert racism or social black-balling until I saw it for myself. For brief time, my fianc\u00e9 and I toyed with the idea of buying a place, so I contacted Stephen, the broker we had used for our rented flat. We wanted to live downtown, I told Stephen, in a pre-war building. He was disarmingly honest about the co-op process, and even went so far as to list which buildings accept Jews and non-whites, and which do not. \"But you won't have a problem getting past the board,\" he said, \"because you are Wasps.\" I am in fact Jewish. We decided to rent after that. As far as I know, such naked exclusionary tactics do not exist in London, my other home town. Nor is there the same frenzy of consumption and self-congratulation. It may be that the worst is yet to come, and London is merely catching up to New York's excesses. But then it is not ruled by the City to the same extent that the stock exchange powers New York. \"Believe me,\" said an editor at New York magazine, when I told him that everybody wants to move to New York. \"If the Nasdaq or the Dow Jones dropped 500 points, Salman Rushdie and Martin Amis would move elsewhere.\" Such impermanence is the great irony and, of all New York's contradictions, perhaps the biggest. What seems to be creative energy is often just feverish activity inside a ballooning bubble. New York is like a Potemkin Village, its inhabitants mere imports for the day. VS Pritchett despised the deracination of New Yorkers. \"There is no place where newness is so continuously pursued,\" he wrote. \"The past is a shame. It must be wrong. New York lives in the present because it is real estate. It has been more for sale than any other city I can think of.\" However, the real threat to New York's predominance is not the instability of its wealth, but the momentum of its own success. The city is in danger of becoming the Monaco of America. The more New York attracts the famous and the established, and celebrates the successful at the expense of the striving, the more it poisons its own creative pool. If the pendulum continues to swing in favour of the have-it-alls, the extraordinary tension which sustains this city will collapse. . . . and the Americans who love London Warren Hoge, London bureau chief, New York Times \"London appeals to New Yorkers with a certain interest in creative life, in cities. For me, the attraction is built around theatre: I used to come each fall to see whatever the new David Hare play was. As for the underground - well, I grew up on the New York subway system, and this is Valhalla compared to that. When people ask if I miss New York, I say: I'm a real New Yorker, but the one place I don't miss New York is London.\" Harriet Gugenheim, Film company executive \"I can't see myself leaving now. I enjoy visiting America, but it's very small-minded. I like the access to the rest of the world you have in Europe - and the feeling that you don't have to worry about being mugged. The one thing that makes me want to leave London? Property prices.\" Rafael Lago, President, American Intercontinental University \"They say the British can be unwelcoming, but it's all to do with attitude: if you're determined to find people unfriendly, they will be unfriendly. There's also a feeling of safety in London that is unlike any other city I've visited. Eventually I guess I'll have to go back but if right now I were to receive a call telling me I had to return, I'd be very disappointed. I've fallen in love with this city.\" Jennifer Waddell, Graphic designer \"I'm attracted to the ease of living in London. Transport is convenient - it makes the pub more enjoyable when you don't have to drive home afterwards. It seems generally safer here as well. Some people find Londoners unfriendly; I like that they generally keep to themselves. But then again, it's expensive and dirty.\"",

The ruling means a potential multi-billion pound bill for the government, which is the principal employer involved. The workers, backed by private and public sector unions, won a ruling in 1994 that excluding part timers, who are mainly women, from pension schemes constituted sex discrimination and a breach of European law on equal pay. Employers, most of whom denied part timers access to occupational schemes, were forced to let them join, but it was unclear how far back those denied access could claim backdated contributions from employers. Unions fought up to the House of Lords and in the European court to establish 1976 as the date, rather than the two years' backdating allowed under UK equal pay law. They lost in the industrial tribunal, employment appeal tribunal and court of appeal, but the House of Lords sent the question to Luxembourg for a ruling. Yesterday, the court ruled in 22 test cases, representing 60,000 applicants, that they can date pension scheme membership back to 1976, or when they started working part time if later. Britain at present has 6m part-time employees. Employers hardest hit by the ruling include banks, the NHS and local education authorities, which all employ large numbers of part-time workers. Workers whose employers run contributory pension schemes will have to put in the contributions they would have paid had they belonged to the scheme. But those working in some sectors, such as banking, where schemes are non-contributory, will get a large windfall without a contribution. The National Union of Teachers said a typical teacher with 25 years' service who worked part time for 12 years of that time, retiring on a salary of \u00a324,000, would get \u00a31,800 a year additional pension and an extra \u00a35,400 lump sum. The NUT's general secretary, Doug McAvoy, said: \"The government could have saved a fortune by accepting its responsibilities rather than fighting against women's rights. We have been arguing the case for our members since 1994. At last [part-time] teachers will be able to press their claims.\" Many people who would have benefited have died while awaiting resolution of this case, and surviving spouses are extremely unlikely to receive a penny. The case will now go back to the House of Lords for a decision on how to take the claims forward. The lords will also have to decide whether workers who filed claims more than six months after leaving their job will be able to claim. Aside from the 60,000, there are hundreds of thousands of others who could benefit. Unions will be pressing the banks and public sector employers to extend the backdating of pension benefits, irrespective of whether a claim was lodged within six months of leaving employment, to all part-time workers since 1976 as a matter of equity. The European court ruled that a six-month time limit would not necessarily breach European law. But the judges said it would be lawful only if a similar time limit applied to such claims under English law.",

      "bodyText": "The cabinet last night unleashed a personal attack on William Hague for deliberately fostering public \"cynicism\" about politics just as this month's Guardian/ICM opinion poll confirmed that voters still see the Conservative leader as an electoral liability to his party. Although the gap between Labour and the Tories slipped to 7% last month - the narrowest lead since the election - and Tony Blair's rating has slumped in the past year from +34 points to +1, the prime minister is still a long way ahead of the Conservative leader. This month's ICM survey shows that only 35% of voters believe Mr Hague is doing a good job, while 46% are dissatisfied, giving him a net rating of -11 points compared with -10 points he recorded in a similar poll in January. This shows that despite high profile speeches on asylum and law and order Mr Hague has made little progress personally in the affections of the electorate in the past five months. Labour is determined to capitalise on these doubts. Downing Street last night gave official blessing to a hard-hitting speech today by Margaret Beckett, leader of the Commons. She will directly accuse Mr Hague of cynicism in seeking to persuade voters that none of the improvments in their lives reflect any credit on governments. \"Everyone says William Hague is opportunistic and has poor short-term judgment, but he does more harm to the country than to the Conservative party. I have come to the conclusion that what he does is not accidental, but is cynical,\" Mrs Beckett said last night. This week's Guardian/ ICM poll confirms ICM's recent private polling for the Tories themselves that the Conservatives are making some modest progress in the eyes of the electorate. When voters were asked when they thought the Conservatives would be returned to power the proportion saying they will get back in at the next election has doubled from the 10% recorded in the immediate aftermath of the 1997 Labour landslide to 20% now. There has been little change among the 41% of voters believe the Tories will get back in at the general election after next, but those who believe it will take at least three general elections before they return to power has more than halved from 31% in 1997 to 14% now. This shift in the perception of the Conservatives' chances of re-election give some perspective to Labour's falling poll lead. Although a lead of only seven points sounds vulnerable it is clear that the overwhelming majority of voters firmly believe that Labour will win the next general election. The issue on which Mr Hague plans his biggest election campaign gamble, the single European currency, still shows all the signs of running in his favour. The ICM monthly tracking question, asking how people would vote if a referendum were held tomorrow on whether Britain should join the euro, shows 60% would be against (down 3); 27% would vote to join (unchanged) and 14% said they did not know (up 3). The slight rise in the don't knows suggests that the impact of a high pound on the British car industry has at the least raised doubts in some voters' minds about the cost of staying out of the euro. \u0095 ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,003 adults aged over 18 by telephone on May 13-15.

      "body": "<p>If you went to university between the mid-80s and early 90s, you may sometimes wonder what undergraduates ever talked about before children's television was invented. From my experience, a whole generation of stand-up comedians and student union drunks would have been silent if they hadn't had cartoons and puppetry for the under-10s to fuel their reminiscing.</p> <p>And now this very generation is being encouraged to revisit the programmes that helped it through Freshers' Week. Children's videos are being sold to adults. One company, Kult Kidz, has even adopted a knowing slogan for the stickers on its video boxes: \"Relive Your Wasted Youth\". </p> <p>\"Kult Kidz is all about children's programming firmly aimed at adults\", says Andrew Wishart, the product manager. Their first release was Bod in 1998. \"Initially we thought that parents were buying it for their kids\", says Wishart. \"But from the number we sell through places like Virgin and HMV we can tell that actually they're self-purchases.

      "bodyText": "If you went to university between the mid-80s and early 90s, you may sometimes wonder what undergraduates ever talked about before children's television was invented. From my experience, a whole generation of stand-up comedians and student union drunks would have been silent if they hadn't had cartoons and puppetry for the under-10s to fuel their reminiscing. And now this very generation is being encouraged to revisit the programmes that helped it through Freshers' Week. Children's videos are being sold to adults. One company, Kult Kidz, has even adopted a knowing slogan for the stickers on its video boxes: \"Relive Your Wasted Youth\". \"Kult Kidz is all about children's programming firmly aimed at adults\", says Andrew Wishart, the product manager. Their first release was Bod in 1998. \"Initially we thought that parents were buying it for their kids\", says Wishart. \"But from the number we sell through places like Virgin and HMV we can tell that actually they're self-purchases. We sell them for \u00a34.99, so people will go in to get the latest Farscape video and then pick up Hector's House as an impulse buy.\" The company's packaging is becoming more adult-orientated accordingly.

      "body": "<p>Warner Village is to become the first big cinema chain in Britain to cater for the Bollywood market by dedicating screens in a Birmingham multiplex that opens in July. </p> <p>Ralf Ludemann of Warner Village said yesterday that six out of 30 screens would show exclusively Indian-made films. His company was able to do this only because of a clampdown on pirated videos of Bollywood films, he said. \"Until bodies like the Federation Against Copyright Theft toughened up on piracy recently, it was not feasible for multiplexes to compete with smuggled videos. </p> <p>\"Without the videos, there are fewer avenues to see these films, so people will come to the Warner Village.\" </p> <p>Bollywood is the popular term for the film industry based in the city of Bombay which makes 600 films a year, worth \u00a3750m worldwide. The UK is Bollywood's biggest export market, but audiences of the three-hour musicals have been restricted to videos, satellite TV or independent cinemas. There is one eight-screen Asian cinema in Birmingham's centre that seats 1,000, and another cinema in nearby Smethwick. But multiplex chains only occasionally hold screenings in places such as Wolverhampton, Leicester or Bolton. </p> <p>Warner Village said the Birmingham screens would be marketed specifically among the Asian community.

      "bodyText": "Warner Village is to become the first big cinema chain in Britain to cater for the Bollywood market by dedicating screens in a Birmingham multiplex that opens in July. Ralf Ludemann of Warner Village said yesterday that six out of 30 screens would show exclusively Indian-made films. His company was able to do this only because of a clampdown on pirated videos of Bollywood films, he said. \"Until bodies like the Federation Against Copyright Theft toughened up on piracy recently, it was not feasible for multiplexes to compete with smuggled videos. \"Without the videos, there are fewer avenues to see these films, so people will come to the Warner Village.\" Bollywood is the popular term for the film industry based in the city of Bombay which makes 600 films a year, worth \u00a3750m worldwide. The UK is Bollywood's biggest export market, but audiences of the three-hour musicals have been restricted to videos, satellite TV or independent cinemas. There is one eight-screen Asian cinema in Birmingham's centre that seats 1,000, and another cinema in nearby Smethwick. But multiplex chains only occasionally hold screenings in places such as Wolverhampton, Leicester or Bolton. Warner Village said the Birmingham screens would be marketed specifically among the Asian community. In inner city Birmingham 70% of the population is black or Asian, and in the city as a whole there are more black and Asian under-18s than there are white under-18s. Mr Ludemann said: \"It's hard to tell if white audiences will come to the films on the back of mainstream hits like East is East. \"Bollywood films are subtitled and very long, with at least six dance intervals. But, if there is a demand, we will increase the number of Bollywood screens.\" Inderjit Dehal is director of the Birmingham Race Action Project,which campaigns for institutional change in the city.

We should have said 28.8 kilobits per second (Kb/s). \u0095 It was incorrect to say (101 tips for travellers, Travel, May 6) that \"Virgin's Upper Class gives out lovely proper-sized Jo Malone smellies.\" Jo Malone does not supply products to Virgin Airlines; they are available at Jo Malone stores, 150 Sloane Street, London SW1X 9BX; and, 24 Royal Exchange, London EC3V 3LP. Jo Malone also runs a Send a Scent service 020-7720 0202. \u0095 Our report, Millennium wheel in a spin over poet's lost line, page 7, yesterday, was, rather embarrassingly, missing its last line. It should have finished as follows [with the missing bit in square brackets]: \"However, Prof Karlin added that Wordsworth 'couldn't spell for toffee' and his punc[tuation was extraordinarily bad.\"] It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.

After the blistering career-best brilliance of his 1987 disc Sentimental Hygiene, Zevon spent the 90s subsiding gradually into a quicksand of popular indifference. It didn't matter that 1991's Mr Bad Example was beyond the wildest dreams of the average singer-songwriter, nor that 1995's Mutineer, though not a masterpiece, deserved far better promotion than it got. Logic led Zevon to the conclusion that he was, to all intents and purposes, retired. </p> <p>He concocted his latest batch of songs without a recording contract, and feeling no particular urge to find one. He made up his own demo tapes to play in his car. \"Jackson Browne and I were having dinner and driving around Santa Monica and I was playing him the new songs, and he asked me what I was going to do. When I told him I had no idea, he suggested calling Danny Goldberg - he's known not to be allergic to artists over 30 or 40 or 50.\" </p> <p>Goldberg, something of a rockbiz legend in his own right and Nirvana's former manager, heard Zevon's tapes and promptly offered him a deal with his new record label, Artemis. It seemed churlish to refuse. Somewhat to his bemusement, the 53-year-old songwriter found that his career had spluttered into life again. </p> <p>Life'll Kill Ya is a fine addition to the Zevon canon, all the better for its stripped down and frequently acoustic arrangements. In the past, Zevon has occasionally been guilty of LA sludge-rock bluster, but these songs flash back to the rough simplicity of his original inspiration, Bob Dylan. Despite the morbid tone of the title tune, or I Was In The House When The House Burned Down, and the terror of medical crises that palpitates through My Shit's Fucked Up or Don't Let Us Get Sick, Zevon's black, ironic delivery manages to suggest that there are still a few more twists left in these tales. His unexpected cover of Steve Winwood's Back In The High Life Again suggests both the painful transience of fame and Zevon's indifference to it. </p> <p>But doesn't he get angry that people don't buy his records? \"Uhhh, not really,\" he answers. \"I wish they'd buy a few more - it would help in many ways. Doesn't seem to be much I can do about it. But I love it when the cult kind of artists say, 'Well, I could change to sell records.' This from, like, a 58-year-old man. 'Yeah, I know how to make a commercial record, but I won't.' \" Zevon roars with malicious laughter. \"Like they ever knew how in the first place. Or if anybody knows how.\" </p> <p>It's disorientating to recall the rocket-assisted ascent of Zevon's career in the mid-70s, when he became the toast of the West Coast with his albums Warren Zevon and Excitable Boy. The cream of the Los Angeles session-man elite queued up to work with him, and Linda Ronstadt covered his songs Poor Poor Pitiful Me and Hasten Down the Wind. Zevon was signed to David Geffen's Asylum label, the centre of California soft rock, and even had a hit single with the deranged Werewolves of London. </p> <p>Geffen founded Asylum as a tasteful boutique label and once boasted that he never wanted to sign more artists than could fit into the sauna in his home. \"I was never in David Geffen's sauna,\" says Zevon firmly. \"Geffen wasn't particularly hands-on with my career. He was gracious enough. You'd play him a new song and he'd encourage you, but I'm not a great intermingler. It's not an accident that I'm a solo performer at the age of 53. I'm a deeply anti-social person. So the fact that I've had a few sustaining friendships over the fullness of time is the anomaly, not the rule. And remember, I was also dead drunk for 27 years, so although I had a sauna, I wasn't in as many saunas as some.\" </p> <p>Yet he was rubbing shoulders with some of the biggest acts of the era. A more calculating artist would undoubtedly have hustled his way into multi-platinum heaven alongside them. </p> <p>\"I remember Glenn Frey from the Eagles calling me, and he said, 'You got a shitload of those songs like Hasten Down the Wind?'

Even manky drunk, he had a certain odd decorum about him, and a curious vulnerability that reminded me of Bert Lahr, the lion in The Wizard of Oz. </p> <p>There are lots of stories about McGuinness. The drink, the tears, the awkward passes, the jokes, and the turn of phrase that can stop traffic. He isn't fearful of failure. He went out on a limb with his 1989 play Lizzie and Mary, based on the illiterate Irish sisters Engels kept as lovers. With Mutabilitie - which transplanted a gay Shakespeare to Ireland to spar with the imperialist Edmund Spenser - he watched a play \"12 years in the brooding\" die from over-ambition. These were mad risks for a writer accustomed to praise for Baglady, the hostage drama Someone Who'll Watch Over Me and a host of masterly translations, including A Doll's House, which won him a Tony award when it appeared on Broadway starring Janet McTeer. </p> <p>McGuinness is 50 this year and, having done battle with the \"great, scarifying European classics\", is ready to strike out again into the unknown on his own. \"Working on Ibsen, Chekhov and Strindberg teaches you how to write. Ibsen was a fecking Viking. You have to be fearless, to juggle with alligators, and to do that you have to master your skill so you can go places where you haven't a clue where you'll end up.\" </p> <p>The fraught relations between Ireland and England are often in his work. McGuinness decommissioned minds with Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, the most dazzling piece about men preparing to die you are ever likely to see. His sexuality is also central to his work, though you won't often hear that in Ireland. In Carthaginians, he gave Ireland her first openly gay hero in Dido Martin, while Innocence, his Caravaggio play, dared to slander a Catholic church then busy covering up the child abusers in its ranks. </p> <p>It can't have been easy growing up in Buncrana, a small seaside town in beautiful but backward Donegal hard by the border with Derry. \"Let's just say I kept my head down,' McGuinness says. \"All I thought about was doing well enough for that grant to university.\" There was no other way out: his father was a breadman and his mother worked in the shirt factories. TV, rock music and Dusty Springfield kept him sane. </p> <p>He went to school in an old cinema, a far-flung outpost of the same church school that produced two Nobel prize winners in Seamus Heaney and John Hume, and where Brian Friel and Seamus Deane were also \"taught lessons in fear,\" as McGuinness puts it. The priests, however, have been coy about claiming him. \"It is not a role that I would want. They don't really talk about me, and I don't talk about them, and I admire them for their reticence.\" There's venom in his words. \"We'll say nothing.\" What Frank won't say is that the local clergy got their revenge for his \"filthy\" Caravaggio by slighting him at his mother's funeral. </p> <p>We'll say nothing about his wardrobe either. There are tramps in Dublin who make it a point of pride to be better turned out than Frank McGuinness. Today, though, he is wearing a shockingly stylish coat: it must be the influence of Kate Moss, whom he met through his friend and \"guiding star\" Marianne Faithfull. </p> <p>We are on a windswept Buncrana beach, where his new play, Dolly West's Kitchen, is set. It is raining, and he is striding into the gale, sucking a cigarette to death and expounding on why he wanted to put \"everything but bestiality\" into the script. Which is a surprise, because Dolly West's Kitchen is a lyrical homecoming piece, not dissimilar to the kind done so well by Brian Friel, who lives down the road, and whose fictional Ballybeg (\"small town\" in Irish) hovers in the hills above Buncrana. Gentle Ireland, Friel's early take on homosexuality, was the first play McGuinness saw and it was obviously an influence. Not that Friel went in much for Irish mammies bringing beautiful transvestite American GIs home for tea to meet their sons. </p> <p>Nor has Friel ever created a character like Rima, the earthy matriarch who sets her world to rights in the strangest of ways before she dies. When she goes, you feel bereaved. \"I meant that to happen,\" says McGuinness. \"I wanted the audience to feel they had been cast into oblivion. Because you are. I may as well admit it, Rima is my mother. Let me tell you, she took no prisoners.\" McGuinness lost both his parents within a short space of time a few years ago. \"It was a devastating experience. Every first night I would ring and she would calm me by telling me that it was only a play. They were proud of what I did but they were afraid of it as well. They came to the first few plays but after that they thought I could manage on my own. She had a much more realistic view of writing than I ever had. In a way they would have liked it if I had been more like Daniel O'Donnell [a camp country and Irish star who has a strange effect on Irishwomen of a certain age]. In another way, they would have killed me if I was.\" </p> <p>Dolly West's Kitchen is about acceptance and a paean to a mother who practised it. Like McGuinness's wonderful first play, Factory Girls, it is also a love letter to his home town. When I ask him why Buncrana doesn't seem keen to claim him, he goes very quiet. I ask him again a few minutes later. \"It's not that kind of town,\" he says, angry with me for goading. And then I remember what he had said the previous night about writing every play he had ever written in a Buncrana accent. \"I slept every night of my life till I was 18 in Buncrana. When I left, it was like going into exile. I couldn't go through that again.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Dolly West's Kitchen opens at the Old Vic, London SE1 (020-7369 1722), tonight.</p>",

It is raining, and he is striding into the gale, sucking a cigarette to death and expounding on why he wanted to put \"everything but bestiality\" into the script. Which is a surprise, because Dolly West's Kitchen is a lyrical homecoming piece, not dissimilar to the kind done so well by Brian Friel, who lives down the road, and whose fictional Ballybeg (\"small town\" in Irish) hovers in the hills above Buncrana. Gentle Ireland, Friel's early take on homosexuality, was the first play McGuinness saw and it was obviously an influence. Not that Friel went in much for Irish mammies bringing beautiful transvestite American GIs home for tea to meet their sons. Nor has Friel ever created a character like Rima, the earthy matriarch who sets her world to rights in the strangest of ways before she dies. When she goes, you feel bereaved. \"I meant that to happen,\" says McGuinness. \"I wanted the audience to feel they had been cast into oblivion. Because you are. I may as well admit it, Rima is my mother. Let me tell you, she took no prisoners.\" McGuinness lost both his parents within a short space of time a few years ago. \"It was a devastating experience. Every first night I would ring and she would calm me by telling me that it was only a play. They were proud of what I did but they were afraid of it as well. They came to the first few plays but after that they thought I could manage on my own. She had a much more realistic view of writing than I ever had. In a way they would have liked it if I had been more like Daniel O'Donnell [a camp country and Irish star who has a strange effect on Irishwomen of a certain age]. In another way, they would have killed me if I was.\" Dolly West's Kitchen is about acceptance and a paean to a mother who practised it. Like McGuinness's wonderful first play, Factory Girls, it is also a love letter to his home town. When I ask him why Buncrana doesn't seem keen to claim him, he goes very quiet. I ask him again a few minutes later. \"It's not that kind of town,\" he says, angry with me for goading. And then I remember what he had said the previous night about writing every play he had ever written in a Buncrana accent. \"I slept every night of my life till I was 18 in Buncrana. When I left, it was like going into exile. I couldn't go through that again.\" \u0095 Dolly West's Kitchen opens at the Old Vic, London SE1 (020-7369 1722), tonight.",

He points out that \"Nepal is still an 85% rural community, whereas our indigenous rural culture has largely been destroyed. And in the Himalayas, people have a completely different relationship to the mountains: there are no roads, only paths - you walk everywhere, and life expectancy is short. There is poverty and lack of education, but they do have a living faith in Buddhism, whereas in the west, we practise periscope religion - it only pops up when someone gets married or dies.\" </p> <p>NVA could be accused of a periscopic flirtation with Buddhism. There is a strong suggestion that you should walk The Path alone - as though this is some path to self-knowledge - and it is hard not to smile indulgently at the little details that slip out: there will be \"exquisite mantras\", sacred cairns, \"helping hands\" and singing bowls in concert. But going into the hills at night, with lighting designed to sculpt the already imposing landscape, should knock any cynicism out of visitors. \"There is a spiritual quest underpinning my involvement,\" says Farquhar, \"but you're not press-ganged into a particular response. On the mountain in the dark, you're in a heightened state - your senses come alive. This is profoundly experiential work, propelling yourself up and down hills at night.\" And then, after all the propelling, keeping it a secret.</p> <p>The Path will take place in a glen in Perthshire from Friday to 4 June (except Mondays). <br>Further details: 0141-204 3346 or <a href=\"http://www.nva.org.uk.\">www.nva.org.uk.</a> <br>Tickets can be booked on 0115-912 9246/01786 461081.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Matt Wells's excellent piece about Piers Morgan's share-buying (It's been a terrible week for newspapers, Media, May 15) goes only part of the way, since it fails to take on board the potential of a DTI investigation. In the same edition, Roy Greenslade tells how a corrosive press stitched up Alastair Campbell and Philip Gould. In your columns the previous week, Jeremy Paxman revealed the sick reporters who make up stories, and this week too we have had the unsatisfactory Press Complaints Commission \"adjudication\" on the Sunday Times and the buying of Jonathan Aitken's allegedly important-to-the-nation memoirs. Editors of major newspapers may well despair at the fraught times they have when complaints are lodged against them, but the answer to their difficulties is to get it right in the first place and fire staff who consistently fail to report the truth. The much vaunted \"political\" nous of Lord Wakeham is, in my view, counter-productive, especially as I spent some years sitting on the PCC and witnessed its inability to grapple with the heart of the problem - the fact that it has no serious sanctions as a watchdog other than the proverbial slap on the wrist. No wonder our television compatriots complain when they face huge fines for getting it wrong. No wonder nobody wants to change anything and maintain the present cosy code of conduct system.

Stephen Potter St Leonards on sea, E Sussex \u0095 As the infantile impulse has long been a source of inspiration in modern art, it seems highly appropriate that those who still have these skills should visit art galleries to see the work of the adults for whom they act as guru. Christopher Bamford London \u0095 As the mother of a two-year-old son, I am ashamed to say that I still have the same interests and need for social interaction as I had when childless. I know that, for some people, it is a crime but I enjoy eating out, checking out the new galleries and mingling with people from all walks of life, childless or otherwise. I usually don't have any option but to take my son along with me when I go to these forbidden places, as there are precious few neighbours or family members around to take him off my hands while I pretend not to be a parent for a few hours. I've considered the alternatives, but I've found it rather limiting sitting at home, day in, day out, locked in a mothers' ghetto and enjoying endless conversations about nappy brands and potty training. My abiding memory of childhood, back in the good old days when children were still seen and not heard, is the feeling that there was an exciting adult world enjoyed by my parents from which my brother and I were completely excluded.

Worldwide, it is attracting new millions. Some 70 new cruise ships are on order, costing \u00a314bn. And still to come is the American sea monster on which - so it is projected - entire families will live, work and take their leisure for months on end.</p> <p>A type of holiday once reserved for the old, rich and tired is attracting both many more and much more diverse customers. Cruising is increasingly popular among Britons. Holiday sailors are getting younger. Perhaps the growth is a reflection of growing affluence. Most cruisers, so to speak, come from London and the south-east. Of the English regions East Anglia takes fewest cruises: perhaps the sight of boating on the Broads has put them off life on the ocean waves.</p> <p>Cruising these days is a more active pursuit. The Caribbean remains a favoured destination where, one imagines, shipboard tourists loll by the pool, occasionally stirring to play deck quoits and buy the odd trinket from traders in bumboats. But there has been a notable increase in trips up and down the rivers Nile, Rhine and Danube, the pleasures of which lie mostly on shore in museums, vineyards and concert halls.</p> <p>It is the Med, though, which attracts most Brits to the poop deck.

      "bodyText": "The difference between a transitive and intransitive is all. If you were to cruise Tangier - or Naples or Piraeus for that matter - flesh would probably be your object. If, however, you were to go cruising to one of those Mediterranean ports, flesh (fried or lightly grilled) might be part of the package but the object would more likely be deep draughts of ozone with occasional trips ashore, wining and dining at the captain's table and body shaking in the several on-board discos. Cruising - to judge from figures out yesterday - has become highly popular. Worldwide, it is attracting new millions. Some 70 new cruise ships are on order, costing \u00a314bn. And still to come is the American sea monster on which - so it is projected - entire families will live, work and take their leisure for months on end. A type of holiday once reserved for the old, rich and tired is attracting both many more and much more diverse customers. Cruising is increasingly popular among Britons. Holiday sailors are getting younger. Perhaps the growth is a reflection of growing affluence. Most cruisers, so to speak, come from London and the south-east. Of the English regions East Anglia takes fewest cruises: perhaps the sight of boating on the Broads has put them off life on the ocean waves. Cruising these days is a more active pursuit. The Caribbean remains a favoured destination where, one imagines, shipboard tourists loll by the pool, occasionally stirring to play deck quoits and buy the odd trinket from traders in bumboats. But there has been a notable increase in trips up and down the rivers Nile, Rhine and Danube, the pleasures of which lie mostly on shore in museums, vineyards and concert halls. It is the Med, though, which attracts most Brits to the poop deck. Either they are moved by some collective memory of Horatio or assured by the fact you cannot sail far across that inland sea without losing sight of land.",

He had an outstanding career both in command and on the staff, but was never more at home than when among soldiers in the field. He was an example of what can be achieved with a combination of leadership, intellect, personality, charm and dedication.</p> <p>He was born in Alberta, Canada, and educated at Yorebridge school, Yorkshire. He joined the Indian army in 1946 and, in 1947, transferred to the British army, went to Sandhurst and was commissioned into the Royal Artillery in October 1948.</p> <p>He served in several gunner regiments, but his heart lay with the 1st Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery, with whom he served on and off for 21 years. He saw service in the UK, Aden and the British Army of the Rhine and, in 1964, took command of the Chestnut troop, the senior battery.</p> <p>In 1969, to his immense pride, Farndale assumed command of the regiment and, during this period, took it to Northern Ireland, the first gunner regiment to serve there in an infantry role. Later, he became the first honorary colonel of the regiment. His infectious enthusiasm, his encouragement to those who needed a helping hand, his sense of humour and his oratory skills made him a legend within the regiment in his lifetime.</p> <p>Farndale would, I feel sure, see himself first and foremost as a commander. He was at ease with soldiers and they, in turn, followed him without hesitation. Nevertheless, he was an equally brilliant staff officer. After passing out from the Camberley staff college in 1959, he served for two years in HQRA 17th Gurkha Division, where he saw active service during the final phases of the Malayan campaign, followed by a spell in military operations at the Ministry of Defence. He became an instructor at Camberley in 1966.</p> <p>After two years on the defence policy staff, he returned to Germany to command 7th Armoured Brigade at Soltau. This was followed by two years as director, public relations, at the MoD, and a further two years as director of military operations. He then commanded the 2nd Armoured Division in Germany for three years.</p> <p>Farndale's grasp of the complexities of the all-arms battle, allied to his inspirational leadership qualities, led to his being appointed to command the 1st (British) Corps. Life was always exciting for those serving with him during this period, as he was a constant source of innovative ideas that kept all concerned on their toes. His success led to promotion to commander, Northern Army Group, and commander-in-chief, British Army of the Rhine.</p> <p>As a Nato general, Farndale earned the respect and loyalty of the national corps under his command from Germany, Holland and Belgium, as well as the 1st British Corps. This was fully tested on Exercise Certain Strike in 1987, the largest exercise of its type in Europe since the second world war. Here, Farndale took under his command a fifth corps, 3 (US) Corps, and established a rapport with its commanding general that lasted the rest of his life.</p> <p>In 1980, he was appointed colonel commandant, Army Air Corps, continuing a line of distinguished senior officers who had filled the post. This was a new area, and, some might have felt, an added burden to his already full and demanding military life.</p> <p>But it was typical of Farndale that, without hesitation, he committed himself completely to his new role. He took a personal interest in every aspect of this small but rapidly developing corps, unstinting with his time and applying his huge capacity for work in an entirely selfless fashion. There is no doubt that the Army Air Corps flourished under his hand.</p> <p>He retired in January 1988 after 42 years' service, and became a director and senior defence adviser to Short Brothers plc, and defence adviser to Deloitte Touche. He kept his links with the army, and particularly the Royal Regiment of Artillery, when he assumed the appointment of master gunner, St James's Park, on November 5 1988. During this period, he was also colonel commandant, Royal Horse Artillery, colonel commandant, Royal Artillery, honorary regimental colonel, 1st Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery, and honorary colonel, 3rd Battalion, the Yorkshire Volunteers.</p> <p>Farndale was also a man of letters and a military historian of note. He wrote four books covering the history of the Royal Artillery, an undertaking he was still engaged in at the time of his death. He was chairman of the English Heritage Battlefields Panel and, from 1989-1993, chairman of the Royal United Services Institute for Defence Studies.</p> <p>In his last years, Farndale threw his energies into safeguarding the heritage of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, particularly as president, and subsequently chairman and chief executive, of its regimental museum project at Woolwich. He was an inveterate and persuasive fund- raiser, to such an extent that some were said to be suffering from donor fatigue. Thanks to his drive, vision and determination to overcome manifold obstacles, the museum will open to the public next year.</p> <p>Martin Farndale was an exceptional man, who lived an exceptional life. He was generous of spirit, an inspiring leader, a true comrade in arms and a firm friend. The world is poorer for his passing but his achievements will be remembered for many a year to come.</p> <p>He was appointed CB in 1980 and KCB in 1983. He married Anne Buckingham in 1955; she survives him, with their son Richard. It was a source of great pride to Farndale that Richard too served in 1st Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery, his old regiment, to which he remained intensely loyal.</p> <p>\u0095 Martin Baker Farndale, soldier, born January 6 1929; died May 10 2000</p>",

In 1969, to his immense pride, Farndale assumed command of the regiment and, during this period, took it to Northern Ireland, the first gunner regiment to serve there in an infantry role. Later, he became the first honorary colonel of the regiment. His infectious enthusiasm, his encouragement to those who needed a helping hand, his sense of humour and his oratory skills made him a legend within the regiment in his lifetime. Farndale would, I feel sure, see himself first and foremost as a commander. He was at ease with soldiers and they, in turn, followed him without hesitation. Nevertheless, he was an equally brilliant staff officer. After passing out from the Camberley staff college in 1959, he served for two years in HQRA 17th Gurkha Division, where he saw active service during the final phases of the Malayan campaign, followed by a spell in military operations at the Ministry of Defence. He became an instructor at Camberley in 1966. After two years on the defence policy staff, he returned to Germany to command 7th Armoured Brigade at Soltau. This was followed by two years as director, public relations, at the MoD, and a further two years as director of military operations. He then commanded the 2nd Armoured Division in Germany for three years. Farndale's grasp of the complexities of the all-arms battle, allied to his inspirational leadership qualities, led to his being appointed to command the 1st (British) Corps. Life was always exciting for those serving with him during this period, as he was a constant source of innovative ideas that kept all concerned on their toes. His success led to promotion to commander, Northern Army Group, and commander-in-chief, British Army of the Rhine. As a Nato general, Farndale earned the respect and loyalty of the national corps under his command from Germany, Holland and Belgium, as well as the 1st British Corps. This was fully tested on Exercise Certain Strike in 1987, the largest exercise of its type in Europe since the second world war. Here, Farndale took under his command a fifth corps, 3 (US) Corps, and established a rapport with its commanding general that lasted the rest of his life. In 1980, he was appointed colonel commandant, Army Air Corps, continuing a line of distinguished senior officers who had filled the post. This was a new area, and, some might have felt, an added burden to his already full and demanding military life. But it was typical of Farndale that, without hesitation, he committed himself completely to his new role. He took a personal interest in every aspect of this small but rapidly developing corps, unstinting with his time and applying his huge capacity for work in an entirely selfless fashion. There is no doubt that the Army Air Corps flourished under his hand. He retired in January 1988 after 42 years' service, and became a director and senior defence adviser to Short Brothers plc, and defence adviser to Deloitte Touche. He kept his links with the army, and particularly the Royal Regiment of Artillery, when he assumed the appointment of master gunner, St James's Park, on November 5 1988. During this period, he was also colonel commandant, Royal Horse Artillery, colonel commandant, Royal Artillery, honorary regimental colonel, 1st Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery, and honorary colonel, 3rd Battalion, the Yorkshire Volunteers. Farndale was also a man of letters and a military historian of note. He wrote four books covering the history of the Royal Artillery, an undertaking he was still engaged in at the time of his death. He was chairman of the English Heritage Battlefields Panel and, from 1989-1993, chairman of the Royal United Services Institute for Defence Studies. In his last years, Farndale threw his energies into safeguarding the heritage of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, particularly as president, and subsequently chairman and chief executive, of its regimental museum project at Woolwich. He was an inveterate and persuasive fund- raiser, to such an extent that some were said to be suffering from donor fatigue. Thanks to his drive, vision and determination to overcome manifold obstacles, the museum will open to the public next year. Martin Farndale was an exceptional man, who lived an exceptional life. He was generous of spirit, an inspiring leader, a true comrade in arms and a firm friend. The world is poorer for his passing but his achievements will be remembered for many a year to come. He was appointed CB in 1980 and KCB in 1983. He married Anne Buckingham in 1955; she survives him, with their son Richard. It was a source of great pride to Farndale that Richard too served in 1st Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery, his old regiment, to which he remained intensely loyal. \u0095 Martin Baker Farndale, soldier, born January 6 1929; died May 10 2000",

What indeed is the point of existing off camera?</p> <p>You are Will Carling.

Now, two years on, you want more access to your son. You start legal proceedings that end up in the High Court this week. But that's not enough. You need to send a message. So you allow yourself to be photographed playing with your child and then give an interview to go with the pictures which appear in the Sun. \"Now Carling fights for his son\" was the headline that dominated the front page along with the photograph of the little tot attempting to kick a rugby ball. How could the horrid judge resist giving him what he wanted?</p> <p>I don't want to be pious about this. It's not as if I haven't on occasion used my own life, and indeed my own children, as material for articles. In fact, I suspect I could probably concoct an autobiography the length of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire out of my yellowing cuttings from this paper's Parents page, various magazines and my column in the New Statesman. But even so, there are right ways and wrong ways of doing things. Do gentlemen permit themselves to be photographed with their two-year-old son as a weapon in a custody dispute?</p> <p>As is usually the case with weapons, the main damage here was done to the man wielding it. You have to admire the Sun's lack of gratitude for its exclusive story. The sub-heading on the front page read: \"Love rat takes ex Ali to court.\" Inside, Will Carling gave an interview in which he defended himself, saying it was all right for him to walk out on Ali Cockayne and their child because he had had no intention of marrying her: \"I was not in love with her. And selfish as it may sound, I couldn't go through the charade of pretending I was.\" As a rebranding exercise - Old Will the cad relaunched as Cuddly Will, the doting dad - this was not a complete success. Is this the man who gives lectures to businessmen? The Sun's own follow-up story described Carling as \"the love rat - who famously left tearful Ali holding the baby two years ago\".</p> <p>Carling could say he was only using little Henry as politicians have always used their children. Remember John Gummer feeding a hamburger to his daughter Cordelia to prove that British beef was safe. Has anything been seen of her since? Is she all right?</p> <p>But Will Carling is like Greta Garbo compared with Les Dennis, the host of the game show Family Fortunes. Guardian readers may have missed the very public collapse of his marriage to actress and ex-Blind Date contestant, Amanda Holden. She was photographed having a tryst with (but of course) Men Behaving Badly star Neil Morrissey. Bad. Then he was photographed falling over in a tequila bar, shouting: \"Neil's a bastard. How can Amanda do that with him?\" Very bad. But then, when she moved out of the house this week, instead of hiding under the covers with the curtains drawn, as any sane person would do, he carried her bag out to the car in front of all the photographers, tried to smile and engage her in conversation before finally being refused a kiss as she shut the car door and drove away. Are these people mad?</p> <p>There are only two explanations for all of this. One is that Will Carling, Les Dennis and other celebrities are producing a post-modern comedy show for Channel 4 as some surreal revenge on the media. The other is that there is a category of people for whom the idea of \"off camera\" and the concept of embarrassment no longer exist. And no doubt before the decade is over Charles and Camilla will be touring regional venues performing the transcript of the Squidgygate tape.</p> <p><b>Auntie and the royal curse</b></p> <p>I know where I stand on the supposed controversy about the BBC's refusal to provide live coverage of the Queen Mother's 100th birthday tribute. I still have the \"Stuff the Jubilee\" badge I wore in 1977. Admittedly, the regime at my school was oppressive enough that I had to wear it behind the lapel of my blazer, but at least I knew it was there.</p> <p>As for the BBC, it may be a case of three times bitten, finally getting shy. Maybe the corporation felt that the massive live coverage given to the weddings of Anne, Charles and Andrew had been a sort of curse. Then there was the experience of the death of Diana. All channels were cleared to reflect the national feeling of mourning; there was nothing on TV but men wearing black ties talking to each other about how sad they felt. Then in the middle of the afternoon the nation perked up and started ringing in to ask if it was really necessary for the EastEnders repeat to be cancelled.</p> <p>At this point, the BBC began to reconsider its plan for the death of the Queen Mother, which had been designed years before, apparently on some Soviet model that involved about a week of nothing but solemn music and Dimblebys dressed in black and speaking in low voices. It has now been scaled down, probably to a 30-second tribute from Carol Vorderman after the Isthmian League football results.</p> <p>In any case, the most impressive tribute to the Queen Mother has already been paid. The pageant may be the second-rate show you'd expect for something that had to be paid for by flogging corporate boxes - but it has been scheduled to take place six weeks after her birthday. What greater compliment could you give a 99-year-old?</p> <p><b>The truth about spuds</b></p> <p>For a moment I was shocked by the finding of a survey carried out this week by the British Potato Council which showed that half of children aged between six and nine believe that potatoes grow on trees. But only for a moment. First, I cheered up immediately simply having learned that something called the British Potato Council exists. Second, I've long been accustomed to discovering that every interesting fact I know is actually wrong - that far from having 200 words for snow, the Inuit have only three. And third, it was only when I moved to the country a year ago that I discovered that Brussels sprouts don't grow like little cabbages on the ground. Instead they perch on stupid sticks, looking for all the world as if they've been stuck on for an April Fool. My own six-year-old is already glumly taking her Sats at a time when she can barely hold a crayon. Am I now meant to sit her down and tell her where potatoes come from?</p>",

The sub-heading on the front page read: \"Love rat takes ex Ali to court.\" Inside, Will Carling gave an interview in which he defended himself, saying it was all right for him to walk out on Ali Cockayne and their child because he had had no intention of marrying her: \"I was not in love with her. And selfish as it may sound, I couldn't go through the charade of pretending I was.\" As a rebranding exercise - Old Will the cad relaunched as Cuddly Will, the doting dad - this was not a complete success. Is this the man who gives lectures to businessmen? The Sun's own follow-up story described Carling as \"the love rat - who famously left tearful Ali holding the baby two years ago\". Carling could say he was only using little Henry as politicians have always used their children. Remember John Gummer feeding a hamburger to his daughter Cordelia to prove that British beef was safe. Has anything been seen of her since? Is she all right? But Will Carling is like Greta Garbo compared with Les Dennis, the host of the game show Family Fortunes. Guardian readers may have missed the very public collapse of his marriage to actress and ex-Blind Date contestant, Amanda Holden. She was photographed having a tryst with (but of course) Men Behaving Badly star Neil Morrissey. Bad. Then he was photographed falling over in a tequila bar, shouting: \"Neil's a bastard. How can Amanda do that with him?\" Very bad. But then, when she moved out of the house this week, instead of hiding under the covers with the curtains drawn, as any sane person would do, he carried her bag out to the car in front of all the photographers, tried to smile and engage her in conversation before finally being refused a kiss as she shut the car door and drove away. Are these people mad? There are only two explanations for all of this. One is that Will Carling, Les Dennis and other celebrities are producing a post-modern comedy show for Channel 4 as some surreal revenge on the media. The other is that there is a category of people for whom the idea of \"off camera\" and the concept of embarrassment no longer exist. And no doubt before the decade is over Charles and Camilla will be touring regional venues performing the transcript of the Squidgygate tape. Auntie and the royal curse I know where I stand on the supposed controversy about the BBC's refusal to provide live coverage of the Queen Mother's 100th birthday tribute. I still have the \"Stuff the Jubilee\" badge I wore in 1977. Admittedly, the regime at my school was oppressive enough that I had to wear it behind the lapel of my blazer, but at least I knew it was there. As for the BBC, it may be a case of three times bitten, finally getting shy. Maybe the corporation felt that the massive live coverage given to the weddings of Anne, Charles and Andrew had been a sort of curse. Then there was the experience of the death of Diana. All channels were cleared to reflect the national feeling of mourning; there was nothing on TV but men wearing black ties talking to each other about how sad they felt. Then in the middle of the afternoon the nation perked up and started ringing in to ask if it was really necessary for the EastEnders repeat to be cancelled. At this point, the BBC began to reconsider its plan for the death of the Queen Mother, which had been designed years before, apparently on some Soviet model that involved about a week of nothing but solemn music and Dimblebys dressed in black and speaking in low voices. It has now been scaled down, probably to a 30-second tribute from Carol Vorderman after the Isthmian League football results. In any case, the most impressive tribute to the Queen Mother has already been paid. The pageant may be the second-rate show you'd expect for something that had to be paid for by flogging corporate boxes - but it has been scheduled to take place six weeks after her birthday. What greater compliment could you give a 99-year-old? The truth about spuds For a moment I was shocked by the finding of a survey carried out this week by the British Potato Council which showed that half of children aged between six and nine believe that potatoes grow on trees. But only for a moment. First, I cheered up immediately simply having learned that something called the British Potato Council exists. Second, I've long been accustomed to discovering that every interesting fact I know is actually wrong - that far from having 200 words for snow, the Inuit have only three. And third, it was only when I moved to the country a year ago that I discovered that Brussels sprouts don't grow like little cabbages on the ground. Instead they perch on stupid sticks, looking for all the world as if they've been stuck on for an April Fool. My own six-year-old is already glumly taking her Sats at a time when she can barely hold a crayon. Am I now meant to sit her down and tell her where potatoes come from?",

      "bodyText": "The cricketer Peter Roebuck has been arrested and questioned by Avon and Somerset police about allegations that he spanked a young South African batsman. Roebuck, 44, now a cricket journalist, was released on police bail to reappear at Exmouth police station in Devon next month. Police said he was arrested at his home in Exmouth on suspicion of two assaults occasioning actual bodily harm. The investigation is believed to centre on claims by the South African, 19, that Roebuck beat his buttocks with a cane or bat while he was sharing his home in Taunton, Somerset, last year. The batsman, who came to Britain to be coached by Roebuck, alleged that the beatings were punishments for poor performance. Devon and Cornwall police said the case was in the hands of Avon and Somerset police. Roebuck, who captained Devon in the Minor Counties championship for six years until last summer, moved from Taunton to a villa in Exmouth after the allegations became public last year. The former pupil of Millfield public school still plays for Budleigh Salterton in Devon.

The home secretary said yesterday that he believed it was time to close the \"revolving door\" that allowed habitual criminals to return repeatedly to a life of crime after serving a community penalty or a short prison sentence. He said the 1991 act did not deal adequately with such repeat offending - especially where the offences were not considered serious enough to justify a prison sentence. \"The system is failing to protect the public from the activities of those repeat offenders, whose level of criminality remains constant but, because of the rigidities in the current system, do not progress properly through the system and keep returning to the courts,\" said Mr Straw.

He said the idea that there was a fixed penalty, or \"price tag\", for certain crimes no matter how many times they were committed was an idea with which he profoundly disagreed.

      "bodyText": "The Czech Republic's foreign minister, Jan Kavan, has come under fire following the publication of a book which claims to document his work as a secret agent in Britain during the communist era in his country. Mr Kavan, who befriended many politicians in the current British government during his 20-year exile in Britain, is accused of cooperating with Prague's former secret police, the StB, during his student days in London between 1969 and 1970. Embarrassingly for the Social Democratic government, the book, Kato: Story of a True Man, referring to his alleged StB code name, Kato, has appeared in Prague bookshops two weeks after Mr Kavan was put in charge of coordinating the Czech intelligence services. Written by two former dissidents, the 530-page book claims to contain his file from the archives of the communist secret police and has photographs of alleged meetings between Mr Kavan and StB agents in Prague during the 1989 revolution. It alleges he met StB case officers 31 times, during which he informed on his British friends, officials at the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation and Czechoslovak students who were considering emigrating to Britain. Formerly a prominent dissident, Mr Kavan, whose mother was British, left Czechoslovakia after the 1968 Soviet-led invasion and spent two decades in exile in London. During those years he supplied information about Czech dissidents and the Charter 77 movement, spearheaded by the future president Vaclav Havel - to the British media and kept up secret links with opposition groups in Czechoslovakia. He returned to Prague for good after the 1989 revolution and was elected to parliament as a member of the Civic Forum, a broad democratic alliance founded by Mr Havel. The book's publication is the latest saga to have plagued Mr Kavan in London and Prague. In 1981, Mr Kavan went to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission (BCC) accusing the British journalist Julian Mannion of falsely stating that a van with banned material sent secretly to Prague by Mr Kavan and seized by the Czech secret police had contained a list of dissident names and addresses. The BCC found against Mr Mannion. But in 1992, the judgment was reversed after documents were released from the secret police's archives. Mr Kavan was accused of \"misleading\" the commission by withholding important information. His defence was that he was trying to protect underground contacts. In 1991, while serving as a deputy in the Czechoslovak parliament, he went to court in Prague to fight accusations that he was an StB agent. The court cleared him in 1996. In the foreword to the book, its authors, Premysl Vachalovsky and John Bok, say they hope it will shed light on the reportedly \"unconscious\" collaboration of Mr Kavan with the StB. Mr Kavan responded in a statement yesterday, saying: \"I consider the publication of the file not only extremely unethical, but also a violation of law. This publication cannot change the fact that I was one of the most efficient opponents of the former regime and one of the most efficient collaborators with the domestic opposition.\" The Czech prime minister, Milos Zeman, condemned the book: \"This is the publication of documents from a criminal organisation, which the StB undoubtedly was.

      "bodyText": "Italian police yesterday arrested a suspect in the assassination of Massimo D'Antona, a government adviser on labour law reform who was shot in a Rome street just under a year ago in the first killing claimed by the leftwing terrorist Red Brigades for 11 years. Police identified the suspect as Alessandro Geri, a 27-year-old trade union employee, and said they believed he was the person who called a newspaper to claim responsibility for the murder in the name of the Red Brigades for the Construction of the Fighting Communist party. Mr Geri was identified through the evidence of a 10-year-old boy who allegedly spotted him at the phone box in Rome used to call in the claim on May 20 1999. Investigators identified the serial number of the prepaid phone card used to make the call, tracking subsequent calls made with the same card. Details of the the inquiry were leaked to the Rome daily La Repubblica at the weekend, forcing investigators to tighten the noose around a group of suspected Red Brigades sympathisers they had been keeping under surveillance. Yesterday police raided numerous premises in Rome and charged Mr Geri with complicity in murder, membership of a subversive organisation, theft of two vans used in the terrorist attack and illegal possession of a firearm. D'Antona was not a public figure. An academic and consultant to the then labour minister, Antonio Bassolino, he was responsible for devising a legal framework for labour relations in the public sector. A 28-page document justifying the attack accused him of playing a key role in the government's reforms, encouraging part-time and temporary work and curtailing the right to strike of public servants. It also condemned \"Nato aggression\" - the alliance was in the midst of the Kosovo bombing campaign at the time. In an interview published yesterday by La Repubblica, D'Antona's widow, Olga, voiced doubts about the motives of her husband's killers and said they may have been serving conservative forces opposed to change. \"My husband was responsible for very important reforms: of public administration, trade union representation, strikes in the transport sector, employer-trade union negotiations,\" she said. \"It's clear he was a source of irritation to many. How can I be sure that someone didn't try to resolve the problem by removing the man who was at the centre of these projects?\"",

      "trailText": "<p>Lars Von Trier's latest movie extravaganza polarised critics, but Fiachra Gibbons loved it. He reports exclusively from Cannes</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In Scandinavia they referred to Breaking the Waves as Breaking the Wives, and film-maker Lars Von Trier is at it again with Dancer in the Dark, putting his women through the full range of physical and psychological horror with such an unwavering gaze that at times it's hard to sit there and watch. This will be the film that goes down in history for its heroine singing from a scaffold. The final, almost unbearable scene in which Bj\u00f6rk's blind criminal is marched the 107 steps from the condemned cell to the gallows makes for the movie's most bizarre and gut-wrenching song and dance number. When she cannot stand up, she is strapped to an upright board where she sings - or, more accurately, Bj\u00f6rks - while we wait to hear whether the authorities will allow a blind woman to be hanged without a hood because \"she just can't breathe with one on\".</p> <p>Boasting a motif from The Sound of Music, Dancer in the Dark is the most unusual, extraordinary feel-good musical ever made - but you may have guessed that already. The critics in attendance at the screening were either visibly moved or not so much booing as hissing or bellowing with rage. Never have I seen a reaction like this to a film, and never have those reactions been so shockingly divided.</p> <p>Bj\u00f6rk - who Von Trier had branded a 'mad woman' only a fortnight ago after she tried to block its screening because of cuts to her score - refused to appear alongside him and her co-star, the legendary French actress Catherine Deneuve, to answer questions. However, she did attend last night's gala screening in Cannes. </p> <p>Bj\u00f6rk's spokeswoman said she was \"too frightened\" by the attention he performance had attracted, and Deneuve disclosed that she was so traumatised by the experience of playing the part of Selma, a Czech immigrant in fifties America, that she may not be able to talk about it for another 10 years.</p> <p>Von Trier, who has admitted to being a tyrant, made no attempt to play down their rift, which culminated in her storming off the set for four days. She is also said to have tried to eat her costume in a fit of rage. </p> <p>Asked what it was like to work with Bj\u00f6rk, he replied, \"It has been terrible but the results have been incredible. Bj\u00f6rk is not an actor. What was a surprise for me is that she seemed like a professional but she really isn't.

      "bodyText": "In Scandinavia they referred to Breaking the Waves as Breaking the Wives, and film-maker Lars Von Trier is at it again with Dancer in the Dark, putting his women through the full range of physical and psychological horror with such an unwavering gaze that at times it's hard to sit there and watch. This will be the film that goes down in history for its heroine singing from a scaffold. The final, almost unbearable scene in which Bj\u00f6rk's blind criminal is marched the 107 steps from the condemned cell to the gallows makes for the movie's most bizarre and gut-wrenching song and dance number. When she cannot stand up, she is strapped to an upright board where she sings - or, more accurately, Bj\u00f6rks - while we wait to hear whether the authorities will allow a blind woman to be hanged without a hood because \"she just can't breathe with one on\". Boasting a motif from The Sound of Music, Dancer in the Dark is the most unusual, extraordinary feel-good musical ever made - but you may have guessed that already. The critics in attendance at the screening were either visibly moved or not so much booing as hissing or bellowing with rage. Never have I seen a reaction like this to a film, and never have those reactions been so shockingly divided. Bj\u00f6rk - who Von Trier had branded a 'mad woman' only a fortnight ago after she tried to block its screening because of cuts to her score - refused to appear alongside him and her co-star, the legendary French actress Catherine Deneuve, to answer questions. However, she did attend last night's gala screening in Cannes. Bj\u00f6rk's spokeswoman said she was \"too frightened\" by the attention he performance had attracted, and Deneuve disclosed that she was so traumatised by the experience of playing the part of Selma, a Czech immigrant in fifties America, that she may not be able to talk about it for another 10 years. Von Trier, who has admitted to being a tyrant, made no attempt to play down their rift, which culminated in her storming off the set for four days. She is also said to have tried to eat her costume in a fit of rage. Asked what it was like to work with Bj\u00f6rk, he replied, \"It has been terrible but the results have been incredible. Bj\u00f6rk is not an actor. What was a surprise for me is that she seemed like a professional but she really isn't. She is not acting in this film but feeling everything, which is extremely hard on her and everyone else too. It was like being with a dying person. She was really feeling it all the time. I was in the awkward position of being the hangman who was pushing her towards her death. But it is the only way it could have been done.\" Van Trier, who is so scared of flying he drove from Denmark in his camper van, said despite their differences he admired her performance. \"I am extremely fond of the work she has done and I would like to thank her for it.\" Deneuve, who formed a close bond with Bj\u00f6rk during the filming, and spent New Year in Iceland with her, did not deny the tension with Bj\u00f6rk on the set. \"But it would be very perverse with such a very special film to give such importance to something behind the scenes. Nothing that is really worth it goes without difficulties, without tension, without crying,\" she said. \"The more difficult and intense a film the more painful it is. Bj\u00f6rk is very special.
