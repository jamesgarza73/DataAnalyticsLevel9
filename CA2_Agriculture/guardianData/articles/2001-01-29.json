      "bodyText": "While Birmingham City improved their chances of a play-off place with a 1-0 victory at Fulham, Graham Taylor's Watford suffered a setback in their bid to secure one of those spots with a 2-1 defeat at Norwich . The dismissal of the Watford striker Gifton Noel-Williams, just after the Hornets had taken the lead through Heidar Helguson, altered the course of the game according to Taylor, whose side went down to two late strikes from Steen Nedergaard and Lee Marshall. \"A red card doesn't always change the face of a game,\" Taylor said, \"but in this instance it most certainly did.\" He blamed Norwich's Chris Llewellyn for bringing on Noel-Williams's second booking and subsequent dismissal by play-acting after a challenge by the young forward. \"It often helps the referee if a player who has been fouled gets up straight away after a challenge. If a player doesn't roll about after a challenge it makes it much, much easier for officials to keep their cards in their pocket,\" he said. In the only other First Division game Grimsby aided their survival hopes with a 2-1 home win over Portsmouth . The Grimsby manager Lennie Lawrence said afterwards that his side needed six more wins to be safe. \"We have taken a big step but we are under no illusions because we have been in a relegation battle since the day I came here,\" he said. Grimsby dominated the first half with goals from Kevin Donovan and Steve Livingstone but Portsmouth pulled one back after the break. The Portsmouth manager Steve Claridge afterwards accused some of his players of thinking \"they are better than they are\". Walsall went top of the Second Division as the Portugese striker Jorge Leitao struck his 14th goal of the season in a 1-0 win at Cambridge . Millwall , the previous leaders, were beaten 1-0 at the New Den by Bournemouth . However it was Claus Jorgensen who was on target and not the prolific Jermaine Defoe whose run of scoring in 10 successive games came to an end.

When we play Manchester United or Arsenal, we get in their faces and try to stop them performing. So it was no surprise Dagenham tried to do that to us.\"",

      "body": "<p>It is not known whether David Ginola looked back in anger as he drove off an hour before kick-off, feeling unused and unwanted. Around 2 hours later John Gregory left, with Aston Villa still in the Cup, to watch the \u00a36m-rated Alaves striker Javi Moreno. Perhaps the manager, too, will be feeling the same sense of emptiness.</p> <p>It is safe to say that the mood of the airport-bound Gregory darkened as much as that at the stadium when he heard that Arnar Gunnlaugsson's devastating shot six minutes from the end of a torrid rancorous tie had knocked the stuffing out of their season. </p> <p>This was a bitter defeat that saw Villa's goalkeeping coach Paul Barron remonstrating with the referee Uriah Rennie at the final whistle before being pulled away by Leicester's manager Peter Taylor as the home fans took it out on the man in black rather than those in claret and blue who had made far more mistakes. </p> <p>Later the noises were conciliatory but hardly convincing. Villa's coach Steve Harrison emerged to heighten the air of unreality. \"It's too soon to say the season is in tatters,\" he insisted. \"Obviously we're very disappointed with our run of results. [But] they've got everything to play for, including a place in Europe.\" </p> <p>The realistic view is that Villa's only European mission this year will be Gregory's current trip, during which he saw Moreno get the only goal of the game against Las Palmas. </p> <p>And after last week's public criticism of the strikers by Doug Ellis, the chairman's many detractors will accuse him of speaking and, even worse, acting too late because the team's principal weakness was glaring long before the \u00a39.5m Juan Pablo Angel was hired. But whoever is at fault, it is now clear that Villa have problems all over the pitch. </p> <p>Ginola would simply like to have been out there and on Saturday evening the Frenchman was in philosophical mode. \"I'm backing Aston Villa and I'm not here to cause any problems for them,\" he said. \"I want to stay and I'll fight for my place.\" The words did not match the picture shortly before 2pm when he was told he was not on the bench. He soon sped away, albeit having been given permission to go home.</p> <p>For all the Frenchman's faults it is difficult to imagine how he could have failed to add something to a fitful Villa performance that demonstrated that chronic forward failings are now being mirrored in defence, previously an area of strength. </p> <p>It hardly helped that Darius Vassell, preferred to Dion Dublin, was sent off for his second needless late tackle. The numbers were levelled up seconds before half-time when Leicester's Callum Davidson received a second booking, for a reckless jump at Steve Staunton that prompted a mass brawl.</p> <p>Amid all the fury, studded by unwanted advice by protesting players on both sides, Rennie calmly and correctly administered justice.</p> <p>The major misjudgments were Villa's. Gareth Barry embarrassingly failed to cut out Matt Elliott's pass that sent Ade Akinbiyi to shoot against David James and roll the rebound home. Then the home defence was out-manoeuvred as the impressive 19-year-old Damien Delaney scooped a pass from which Elliott's beautifully volleyed touch set up Gunnlaugsson's thunderous left-foot finish. </p> <p>It was a move of imagination and precision mocking the barrenness of the football before.

      "bodyText": "It is not known whether David Ginola looked back in anger as he drove off an hour before kick-off, feeling unused and unwanted. Around 2 hours later John Gregory left, with Aston Villa still in the Cup, to watch the \u00a36m-rated Alaves striker Javi Moreno. Perhaps the manager, too, will be feeling the same sense of emptiness. It is safe to say that the mood of the airport-bound Gregory darkened as much as that at the stadium when he heard that Arnar Gunnlaugsson's devastating shot six minutes from the end of a torrid rancorous tie had knocked the stuffing out of their season. This was a bitter defeat that saw Villa's goalkeeping coach Paul Barron remonstrating with the referee Uriah Rennie at the final whistle before being pulled away by Leicester's manager Peter Taylor as the home fans took it out on the man in black rather than those in claret and blue who had made far more mistakes. Later the noises were conciliatory but hardly convincing. Villa's coach Steve Harrison emerged to heighten the air of unreality. \"It's too soon to say the season is in tatters,\" he insisted. \"Obviously we're very disappointed with our run of results. [But] they've got everything to play for, including a place in Europe.\" The realistic view is that Villa's only European mission this year will be Gregory's current trip, during which he saw Moreno get the only goal of the game against Las Palmas. And after last week's public criticism of the strikers by Doug Ellis, the chairman's many detractors will accuse him of speaking and, even worse, acting too late because the team's principal weakness was glaring long before the \u00a39.5m Juan Pablo Angel was hired. But whoever is at fault, it is now clear that Villa have problems all over the pitch. Ginola would simply like to have been out there and on Saturday evening the Frenchman was in philosophical mode. \"I'm backing Aston Villa and I'm not here to cause any problems for them,\" he said. \"I want to stay and I'll fight for my place.\" The words did not match the picture shortly before 2pm when he was told he was not on the bench. He soon sped away, albeit having been given permission to go home. For all the Frenchman's faults it is difficult to imagine how he could have failed to add something to a fitful Villa performance that demonstrated that chronic forward failings are now being mirrored in defence, previously an area of strength. It hardly helped that Darius Vassell, preferred to Dion Dublin, was sent off for his second needless late tackle. The numbers were levelled up seconds before half-time when Leicester's Callum Davidson received a second booking, for a reckless jump at Steve Staunton that prompted a mass brawl. Amid all the fury, studded by unwanted advice by protesting players on both sides, Rennie calmly and correctly administered justice. The major misjudgments were Villa's. Gareth Barry embarrassingly failed to cut out Matt Elliott's pass that sent Ade Akinbiyi to shoot against David James and roll the rebound home. Then the home defence was out-manoeuvred as the impressive 19-year-old Damien Delaney scooped a pass from which Elliott's beautifully volleyed touch set up Gunnlaugsson's thunderous left-foot finish. It was a move of imagination and precision mocking the barrenness of the football before. Even if Villa improved in the second half their goal stemmed from a seeming miscue by Staunton and a clumsy Taggart challenge before Julian Joachim scored in his first appearance for nine weeks. Ellis must be noting Villa's forthcoming fixtures. Like those at Bradford City and Derby, sandwiching the visit of Middlesbrough, next month. And his club's fall from fourth place to 13th in the space of two months. The chairman will also have noted the fact that Leicester, currently the Midlands' top team, have largely prospered under a new manager who has fashioned the sort of rapid overhaul needed at Villa Park.

It is now no longer enough to debate the highlights of a match with fellow spectators while scurrying back to the car. The need now is to identify a friend who was not there, and provide an instant appraisal. Match reports on the whistle, whether you like it or not.</p> <p>While the inimitable football bard, Stuart Hall, was delivering his Five Live rhapsody, Jaz's breathless mobile call possessed an earthier but equally arresting theme. \"Last minute, yeah, Goater's header, bang, straight in, fights broke out, the police were called in, amazing finish. The rest of it was crap, though, mate.\"</p> <p>It was, too. Shaun Goater, brought on with 19 minutes remaining, salvaged a desperately poor Manchester City display when he headed in Tony Grant's corner in the second minute of injury-time. Coventry were out of the Cup and out of luck, but at least they seem the likelier of these two sides to preserve their Premiership status.</p> <p>The goal sparked outbreaks of fighting in the main stand, when Coventry supporters invaded a home section, and more than 10 minutes elapsed before police and stewards restored order. It was never frightening, but it was a disturbing throwback to English football's wretched hooligan years, and will inevitably require an FA inquiry. </p> <p>Manchester City's midfield was overstocked with defenders with barely a creative bone in their body. Their best prospects seemed to rest with the uncertainty of Magnus Hedman in Coventry's goal and it was Hedman, indeed, whose confusion with Paul Williams first conceded the corner and then allowed Goater a free header. </p> <p>Paulo Wanchope stalked angrily down the tunnel upon being substituted. Goater's goal vindicated Joe Royle's decision, and Wanchope had made no valuable contribution. His anger should have been directed at himself. </p> <p>Darren Huckerby's anxiety to impress against his former club was almost deranged: he repeatedly ran into defenders rather than around them. Williams spent half the after noon trying to calm him down; a less honest and more calculating defender might have imagined he could goad Huckerby into getting himself sent off. </p> <p>Coventry's liveliest moments came through Craig Bellamy, who led the line sparkily, and who deserves better fortune. John Eustace struck the post in the first half from Bellamy's pass, and Bellamy headed narrowly wide from Eustace's driven cross.</p> <p>That apart, there was little worth telling. Mobiles have long become the accepted method of disseminating totally worthless information. This was a match that belonged on the end of a mobile phone call.</p>",

The need now is to identify a friend who was not there, and provide an instant appraisal. Match reports on the whistle, whether you like it or not. While the inimitable football bard, Stuart Hall, was delivering his Five Live rhapsody, Jaz's breathless mobile call possessed an earthier but equally arresting theme. \"Last minute, yeah, Goater's header, bang, straight in, fights broke out, the police were called in, amazing finish. The rest of it was crap, though, mate.\" It was, too. Shaun Goater, brought on with 19 minutes remaining, salvaged a desperately poor Manchester City display when he headed in Tony Grant's corner in the second minute of injury-time. Coventry were out of the Cup and out of luck, but at least they seem the likelier of these two sides to preserve their Premiership status. The goal sparked outbreaks of fighting in the main stand, when Coventry supporters invaded a home section, and more than 10 minutes elapsed before police and stewards restored order. It was never frightening, but it was a disturbing throwback to English football's wretched hooligan years, and will inevitably require an FA inquiry. Manchester City's midfield was overstocked with defenders with barely a creative bone in their body. Their best prospects seemed to rest with the uncertainty of Magnus Hedman in Coventry's goal and it was Hedman, indeed, whose confusion with Paul Williams first conceded the corner and then allowed Goater a free header. Paulo Wanchope stalked angrily down the tunnel upon being substituted. Goater's goal vindicated Joe Royle's decision, and Wanchope had made no valuable contribution. His anger should have been directed at himself. Darren Huckerby's anxiety to impress against his former club was almost deranged: he repeatedly ran into defenders rather than around them. Williams spent half the after noon trying to calm him down; a less honest and more calculating defender might have imagined he could goad Huckerby into getting himself sent off. Coventry's liveliest moments came through Craig Bellamy, who led the line sparkily, and who deserves better fortune. John Eustace struck the post in the first half from Bellamy's pass, and Bellamy headed narrowly wide from Eustace's driven cross. That apart, there was little worth telling. Mobiles have long become the accepted method of disseminating totally worthless information. This was a match that belonged on the end of a mobile phone call.",

It's nice to get a couple because I have waited 14 years to be a hero for once instead of being a villain.\" </p> <p>Of Koumas, who scored Rovers' other goal with an angled chip from 20 yards, Yates said: \"Jason's was a great finish and he played ever so well. Everybody did, but Jason just took the chance to show off his ability. He's a Premiership player and I'm sure there are a lot of clubs interested in him. He proved what a great player he is already by the way he took on Everton on their own ground.\" </p> <p>Tranmere make a habit of upsetting Premiership sides, adding Everton to West Ham, Coventry, Middlesbrough, Sunderland and Leeds in the past 16 months. But Yates said: \"This was the best of our cup giant-killings over the past couple of seasons. This time we not only had to face one of the biggest clubs around us but we had to do it on their ground. People expected us to get beaten so it was great to get ourselves into the next round with a performance like that.\" </p> <p>Everton have had many, many dark days of late but this was a total blackout in terms of thought, reason, logic and, most significantly, pride. </p> <p>It was almost impossible not to feel some sympathy for Walter Smith afterwards. As the cries of the disenchanted drifted up from the street below, he attempted to explain away the unexplainable, attempted without success to find some way of excusing the inexcusable. He simply pointed out that Tranmere took their goals well. </p> <p>Having dominated the opening 10 or so minutes, Everton gave up. Tranmere isolated the weakest link in Everton's chain of many weak links, David Unsworth, and funnelled everything down the right flank. It was a clever ploy and Unsworth obliged with a series of errors. Unable to deal with the sprinting speed of the excellent Andy Parkinson, the former England international defender fell to pieces before being hauled off at half-time. </p> <p>For Smith the damage had already been done. After 22 minutes Yates climbed well at the far post to send a looping header over the strangely leaden-footed Thomas Myhre, and 13 minutes on Koumas swept in gloriously. </p> <p>Thereafter Tranmere, currently 21st in the First Division, began to swagger and but for some decidedly dodgy finishing - Yates's second goal apart - the final margin of victory would have been enormous rather than merely generous. </p> <p>\"My players are driving me mad,\" said Tranmere's manager John Aldridge. \"They play so well in the cup games yet we are marooned near the foot of the First Division table. It's very confusing.\" </p> <p>As those Everton supporters who applauded Aldridge's men off the pitch headed home, Goodison's public address system crackled into life. \"We look forward to seeing you all again on Wednesday night when Middlesbrough are the visitors,\" said the disembodied voice without a hint of irony. No chance.</p>",

But Yates said: \"This was the best of our cup giant-killings over the past couple of seasons. This time we not only had to face one of the biggest clubs around us but we had to do it on their ground. People expected us to get beaten so it was great to get ourselves into the next round with a performance like that.\" Everton have had many, many dark days of late but this was a total blackout in terms of thought, reason, logic and, most significantly, pride. It was almost impossible not to feel some sympathy for Walter Smith afterwards. As the cries of the disenchanted drifted up from the street below, he attempted to explain away the unexplainable, attempted without success to find some way of excusing the inexcusable. He simply pointed out that Tranmere took their goals well. Having dominated the opening 10 or so minutes, Everton gave up. Tranmere isolated the weakest link in Everton's chain of many weak links, David Unsworth, and funnelled everything down the right flank. It was a clever ploy and Unsworth obliged with a series of errors. Unable to deal with the sprinting speed of the excellent Andy Parkinson, the former England international defender fell to pieces before being hauled off at half-time. For Smith the damage had already been done. After 22 minutes Yates climbed well at the far post to send a looping header over the strangely leaden-footed Thomas Myhre, and 13 minutes on Koumas swept in gloriously. Thereafter Tranmere, currently 21st in the First Division, began to swagger and but for some decidedly dodgy finishing - Yates's second goal apart - the final margin of victory would have been enormous rather than merely generous. \"My players are driving me mad,\" said Tranmere's manager John Aldridge. \"They play so well in the cup games yet we are marooned near the foot of the First Division table. It's very confusing.\" As those Everton supporters who applauded Aldridge's men off the pitch headed home, Goodison's public address system crackled into life. \"We look forward to seeing you all again on Wednesday night when Middlesbrough are the visitors,\" said the disembodied voice without a hint of irony. No chance.",

Beating such illustrious rivals as Anthony Hopkins and dear Larry, <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/Feature_Story/Guardian/0,,44049,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Sir Sean</a> has been voted Britain's No 1 film thesp ever by 10,000 participants of the Orange Film Survey.</p> <p>2. He's best known, of course, for playing <a href=\" http://www.jamesbond.com/main_adv.html\" target=\"_new\">that suave chap</a> in the tux. It's accepted wisdom that Connery's <a href=\" http://jamesbond007.net/films/no/no6.jpg\" target=\"_new\">rough'n'ready</a> interpretation is the classic (Jamesh) Bond.</p> <p>3. <a href=\"http://mrshowbiz.go.com/people/seanconnery/Index.html\" target=\"_new\">Connery</a>, though, actually came to hate the association with 007, leaving the franchise in 1967 after <a href=\" http://members.netscapeonline.co.uk/bondsupp007/movie/yolt.htm\" target=\"_new\"> You Only Live Twice </a> and only returning for 1971's <a href=\" http://www.mcs.net/~klast/www/daf.html\" target=\"_new\"> Diamonds Are Forever </a> after executives offered him a massive pay-off to save them from George Lazenby.</p> <p>4. And introducing the world to the concept of portly, balding Bond, he had one last crack of the whip in 1983's unofficial spin-off <a href=\" http://www.universalexports.net/Movies/neveragain.html\" target=\"_new\"> Never Say Never Again </a>. Quite.</p> <p>5. Large amounts of money were again the incentive, though Connery's attachment to cash perhaps isn't surprising considering that earlier occupations included milkman, bricklayer, lifeguard and, erm, <a href=\" http://brianj1.tripod.com/bodybuilder/seanconnery1.jpg\" target=\"_new\"> Mr Universe competitor</a> (in 1953 - fourth from left).</p> <p>6. But happily for the movie world, acting proved to be his true vocation. Early in his <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Connery,+Sean\" target=\"_new\">career</a>, he grappled with such demanding roles as \"Extra\", \"2nd welder\" and \"Mountaine McClintock\".</p> <p>7. Bond made him a <a href=\"http://www.seeing-stars.com/StarIndexes/SeanConnery.shtml\" target=\"_new\">star</a> though and later Connery highlights include a <a href=\" http://home.hawaii.rr.com/ramstar/nameoftherose7k.jpg\" target=\"_new\">Franciscan monk</a> (The Name of the Rose), <a href=\"http://www.ozcraft.com/cgibin/picview.cgi?highland/lesson.jpg\" target=\"_new\"> Spanish swordsman </a> (Highlander) and an Irish copper (<a href=\" http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0094226 \" target=\"_new\">The Untouchables</a>). All with the same Scots brogue.</p> <p>8. Perhaps his other best-known role is as <a href=\"http://www.ozcraft.com/scifidu/indiana/fire.jpg\" target=\"_new\">Indiana Jones' dad</a> in the third film. Sean's probably <a href=\" http://brianj1.tripod.com/beefcake/seanconnery2.jpg\" target=\"_new\">glad</a> that most people's memories don't stretch back much further than that.</p> <p>9. Despite having lived in <a href=\" http://www.pgb.es/marbella/\" target=\"_new\">Marbella</a> for some time now, Sean fondly remembers his native Scotland and is a vocal supporter of the <a href=\"http://www.snp.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">SNP</a>.</p> <p>10. He may be 70 now, but the ladies still <a href=\" http://www.geocities.com/NapaValley/4121/seanconnery.html\" target=\"_new\">love</a> him and he finds the time, between rounds of <a href=\" http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0862415314/qid%3D980769676/026-4813884-9538064\" target=\"_new\">golf</a>, to bang out a film or two a year. See him next in <a href=\" http://www.spe.sony.com/movies/findingforrester/\" target=\"_new\">Finding Forrester</a>, in which he fine-tunes his Indiana Jones Sr act as a tetchy bookish mentor.</p>",

      "bodyText": "1. Beating such illustrious rivals as Anthony Hopkins and dear Larry, Sir Sean has been voted Britain's No 1 film thesp ever by 10,000 participants of the Orange Film Survey. 2. He's best known, of course, for playing that suave chap in the tux. It's accepted wisdom that Connery's rough'n'ready interpretation is the classic (Jamesh) Bond. 3. Connery, though, actually came to hate the association with 007, leaving the franchise in 1967 after You Only Live Twice and only returning for 1971's Diamonds Are Forever after executives offered him a massive pay-off to save them from George Lazenby. 4. And introducing the world to the concept of portly, balding Bond, he had one last crack of the whip in 1983's unofficial spin-off Never Say Never Again . Quite. 5. Large amounts of money were again the incentive, though Connery's attachment to cash perhaps isn't surprising considering that earlier occupations included milkman, bricklayer, lifeguard and, erm, Mr Universe competitor (in 1953 - fourth from left). 6. But happily for the movie world, acting proved to be his true vocation. Early in his career, he grappled with such demanding roles as \"Extra\", \"2nd welder\" and \"Mountaine McClintock\". 7. Bond made him a star though and later Connery highlights include a Franciscan monk (The Name of the Rose), Spanish swordsman (Highlander) and an Irish copper (The Untouchables). All with the same Scots brogue. 8. Perhaps his other best-known role is as Indiana Jones' dad in the third film. Sean's probably glad that most people's memories don't stretch back much further than that. 9. Despite having lived in Marbella for some time now, Sean fondly remembers his native Scotland and is a vocal supporter of the SNP. 10. He may be 70 now, but the ladies still love him and he finds the time, between rounds of golf, to bang out a film or two a year. See him next in Finding Forrester, in which he fine-tunes his Indiana Jones Sr act as a tetchy bookish mentor.",

Two further semi-finals, at Wimbledon and Flushing Meadows, came the next year and then in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics she startled the world by defeating Germany's Steffi Graf for the gold medal on red clay. It appeared there was nothing she might not achieve, but with a suddenness that shocked everybody involved her world fell apart. </p> <p>She experienced depression, became unable to motivate herself and then suffered further problems in her private life, such as it was, being charged with shoplifting and later being found in possession of drugs. </p> <p>Distraught, mixed up and unable to cope with the pressures of the sport and the expectations of her father Stefano, she turned her back on tennis for two years, before eventually making the first of a series of comebacks that were frequently painful, tearful and abortive. </p> <p>She wanted to be back in the tennis limelight, and she also wanted to be left alone. It seemed, despite her best intentions and the continued support of many, that she was finished as a player. Then, in 1999 and still only 23, the first signs of the renaissance appeared with tournament wins in Strasbourg and Quebec City. That same year, in the US Open, she read a carefully prepared statement saying that all her problems had been her own fault and that she now hoped everybody would draw a line under the past and help her to move forward. It was both brave and cathartic, though even then it appeared the game had moved on too quickly for her to play catch-up. </p> <p>And this is what made her 6-4, 6-3 victory over Switzerland's Martina Hingis on Saturday so very special, for it was a triumph of spirit over self-doubt and exemplified the enduring bond between father and daughter. Stefano Capriati, born in the Italian city of Brindisi, has been blamed for pushing his daughter too hard and too soon. His punishment, if such it was, was to lose control of the person he loved the most and watch in horror and sadness as she all but self-destructed. Now, as in those early and traumatic days, he is coaching her again, but this time the relationship is much different. For a start he cannot tell her when to go to bed. </p> <p>Capriati was asked if she could compare her first grand slam win with the Olympic title. \"That actually seems like another life. This is a new life, a different life. It's like winning something for the first time again.\" </p> <p>This was Hingis's fourth successive grand slam final defeat and once again she was overpowered, wins over the Williams sisters taking their toll, perhaps mentally as much as physically. There was no doubting her fitness but Capriati was in equally good shape. Having raced to a 5-1 first-set lead, the American took only two points from the next two games and went on to miss two set points on the Hingis serve. The match appeared to be swinging in favour of the world No1 but these setbacks stiffened rather than weakened Capriati's resolve. In this respect it mirrored her recent life.</p>",

Distraught, mixed up and unable to cope with the pressures of the sport and the expectations of her father Stefano, she turned her back on tennis for two years, before eventually making the first of a series of comebacks that were frequently painful, tearful and abortive. She wanted to be back in the tennis limelight, and she also wanted to be left alone. It seemed, despite her best intentions and the continued support of many, that she was finished as a player. Then, in 1999 and still only 23, the first signs of the renaissance appeared with tournament wins in Strasbourg and Quebec City. That same year, in the US Open, she read a carefully prepared statement saying that all her problems had been her own fault and that she now hoped everybody would draw a line under the past and help her to move forward. It was both brave and cathartic, though even then it appeared the game had moved on too quickly for her to play catch-up. And this is what made her 6-4, 6-3 victory over Switzerland's Martina Hingis on Saturday so very special, for it was a triumph of spirit over self-doubt and exemplified the enduring bond between father and daughter. Stefano Capriati, born in the Italian city of Brindisi, has been blamed for pushing his daughter too hard and too soon. His punishment, if such it was, was to lose control of the person he loved the most and watch in horror and sadness as she all but self-destructed. Now, as in those early and traumatic days, he is coaching her again, but this time the relationship is much different. For a start he cannot tell her when to go to bed. Capriati was asked if she could compare her first grand slam win with the Olympic title. \"That actually seems like another life. This is a new life, a different life. It's like winning something for the first time again.\" This was Hingis's fourth successive grand slam final defeat and once again she was overpowered, wins over the Williams sisters taking their toll, perhaps mentally as much as physically. There was no doubting her fitness but Capriati was in equally good shape. Having raced to a 5-1 first-set lead, the American took only two points from the next two games and went on to miss two set points on the Hingis serve. The match appeared to be swinging in favour of the world No1 but these setbacks stiffened rather than weakened Capriati's resolve. In this respect it mirrored her recent life.",

He achieved it, and the relief was palpable. It was, in effect, Cl\u00e9ment's last stand.

Far from it. \"I hope I can get better. That's my goal. That's what I want to do.

      "body": "<p>A senior medical adviser to the troubled biotechnology com-pany, Scotia Holdings, has hit out at Europe's drugs evaluation agency, claiming it did not understand the science behind the company's controversial cancer treatment, Foscan. </p> <p>Colin Hopper, a consultant at UCL Hospital, London, believes the European Medical Evaluation Agency acted \"unreasonably\" in rejecting Foscan. The decision triggered a suspension of Scotia's shares amid doubts about the company's financial viability. </p> <p>He said the decision deprived patients of a crucial treatment for head and neck cancer: \"We have nothing else to treat these patients with. It's a terrible shame this drug didn't get a licence.\" </p> <p>Mr Hopper gave evidence supporting Scotia to the Emea's evaluation committee, which voted against Foscan on Tuesday evening. He said: \"I have concerns about the way the evaluation was carried out.\" </p> <p>One of the Emea's most important objections - according to Mr Hopper - was that Scotia did not carry out a strictly monitored test comparing Foscan to existing treatments. </p> <p>This was impossible, he said, because the only widely used procedures are chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which offer little or no survival benefit to those suffering from cancer of the head and neck. </p> <p>Mr Hopper said he had doubts about the four \"independent experts\" consulted by the agency. \"I have been going to head and neck cancer conferences for 20 years. I find it surprising that I didn't recognise, or know anything about these people. The committee didn't raise any issues with us which weren't answered robustly. \"They kept their complaints to themselves and then, when we left the room, they decided they didn't believe in the treatment for whatever reason.\" </p> <p>Between 2,500 and 3,000 new cases of head or neck cancer are diagnosed annually in Britain.

      "bodyText": "A senior medical adviser to the troubled biotechnology com-pany, Scotia Holdings, has hit out at Europe's drugs evaluation agency, claiming it did not understand the science behind the company's controversial cancer treatment, Foscan. Colin Hopper, a consultant at UCL Hospital, London, believes the European Medical Evaluation Agency acted \"unreasonably\" in rejecting Foscan. The decision triggered a suspension of Scotia's shares amid doubts about the company's financial viability. He said the decision deprived patients of a crucial treatment for head and neck cancer: \"We have nothing else to treat these patients with. It's a terrible shame this drug didn't get a licence.\" Mr Hopper gave evidence supporting Scotia to the Emea's evaluation committee, which voted against Foscan on Tuesday evening. He said: \"I have concerns about the way the evaluation was carried out.\" One of the Emea's most important objections - according to Mr Hopper - was that Scotia did not carry out a strictly monitored test comparing Foscan to existing treatments. This was impossible, he said, because the only widely used procedures are chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which offer little or no survival benefit to those suffering from cancer of the head and neck. Mr Hopper said he had doubts about the four \"independent experts\" consulted by the agency. \"I have been going to head and neck cancer conferences for 20 years. I find it surprising that I didn't recognise, or know anything about these people. The committee didn't raise any issues with us which weren't answered robustly. \"They kept their complaints to themselves and then, when we left the room, they decided they didn't believe in the treatment for whatever reason.\" Between 2,500 and 3,000 new cases of head or neck cancer are diagnosed annually in Britain. Sufferers often lose the ability to speak and to swallow. The Emea's head of evaluations for human medicines, Noel Radhion, declined to comment: \"Our job is to issue recommendations to the European commission. We cannot say what applications are under review.\" \u0095 Biotechnology company Antisoma is set to announce today that it has begun clinical trials of TheraFab, a lung cancer drug which enhances the accuracy of radiotherapy and limits side-effects.",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Gordon Brown, today promised that a second-term Labour government would strive to create a \"Britain of nations and regions\" as part of its bid to secure an economic renaissance outside the prosperous south of England. The chancellor's speech, delivered to the University of Manchester Science and Technology Institute, suggested a new package of regional policies could be unveiled in Labour's general election manifesto, or shortly after the election. Mr Brown hinted that this might include a commitment to directly elected regional government: \"As we develop regional policies that are locally generated and managed, there has to be local and regional accountability too.\" He added that the government would push more power down to the regions by ensuring a central and growing role for regional development agencies (RDAs) in promoting business growth, training and skills. Mr Brown said locally based regeneration and economic development policy initiatives would play a key role in boosting the country's fortunes, and provide regional capitals with the chance of becoming power bases to rival London. The next budget, said Mr Brown, would contain measures to encourage an \"enterprise culture\" in areas of high unemployment, and the government would consider new incentives for urban renewal and inner city development. The chancellor said that ministers had already adopted a regional policy focus by creating the RDAs, and through the government's regional approach to both the New Deal and venture capital funding. The speech suggested \"a greater role\" for the House of Commons in regional affairs, and more powers for regional chambers, which bring members of the private, public and voluntary sectors together to discuss regional issues and scrutinise the work of RDAs. Despite Mr Brown's statement on regional government, local government minister Hilary Armstrong today indicated that movement on the issue was unlikely before the election. Members of the pro-devolution Campaign for the English Regions welcomed the chancellor's comments, suggesting they were the result of an alliance between Mr Brown and deputy prime minister John Prescott, who is strongly in favour of regional government. Campaign spokesman Don Price said: \"Brown's involvement means this is a debate that has gone beyond the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions.\"",

      "body": "<p>The full text of Gordon Brown's speech, made today at the University of Manchester Science and Technology Institute.</p> <p>It is a pleasure to be here in Manchester this morning. </p> <p>For two centuries Manchester and the north-west have been a worldwide centre for manufacturing strength. This region led in the 19th century and now it can lead again. </p> <p>And let me say how pleased I am to be speaking here at UMIST. Founded early in the 19th century by the business community of Manchester, it enters the 21st century a leading centre for scientific research, its links with business stronger than ever - promoting growth, jobs and opportunity for the north-west region and beyond.</p> <p>Today I want to show how in the north-west and the other regions of our country, the high ideals and public purpose contained in the economic goal of 1944 can be achieved.</p> <p>Full employment - defined as in 1944 as 'high and stable levels of employment' - was a reality for the country as a whole for 20 years after the second world war. </p> <p>But not only did rising unemployment in the 1970s and beyond undermine these goals but so too did persistently higher unemployment in our regions. As recently as 1997, one in five working age households had no one in work in seven of our 12 regions and nations. </p> <p>Some believe that full employment can be achieved only by a return to macroeconomic fine tuning. </p> <p>Others believe that in the new more open economy governments cannot hope to meet the 1944 objectives. </p> <p>I reject both the dogma of insisting on old ways and the defeatism of abandoning the objectives. But to achieve full employment in all the regions is a large and ever present challenge and demands new approaches not the old ways. So since 1997 the new government has been putting in place a new framework to deliver our growth and employment objectives. </p> <p>Last year I set down four objectives: </p> <p>\u0095 First: stability - a pro-active monetary policy and prudent fiscal policy to deliver the necessary platform of stability; </p> <p>\u0095 Second: employability - a strengthening of the programme to move the unemployed from welfare to work; </p> <p>\u0095 Third: productivity - a commitment to high quality long term investment in science and innovation, new technology and skills; </p> <p>\u0095 Fourth: responsibility - avoiding short termism in pay and wage bargaining across the private and public sectors, and building a shared sense of national purpose. These conditions - requirements for stability, employability, productivity and responsibility - are and have always been the necessary conditions for full employment.</p> <p>The first condition, stability, is needed to ensure a sustainable high demand for labour. The second, employability, promotes a sustainable high supply of labour. The third, raising productivity, provides a sustainable basis for rising living standards. And the fourth, responsibility in bargaining, ensures a sustainable basis for combining full employment with low inflation. But there is a fifth condition I wish to discuss in detail today - the need for regionally balanced growth, essential if there is to be opportunity for all in all regions. </p> <p>Now the first generation of regional and urban policies - starting in the '30s - amounted essentially to ambulance work - first-aid measures, urgently needed assistance and relief in areas of high unemployment. The second generation of regional policies came in the '60s when then the emphasis was on large capital grants and tax incentives for regions anxious to encourage mobile capital into our regions as inward investment.</p> <p>Now we are entering a third generation of regional policies inaugurated by Stephen Byers, David Blunkett and John Prescott, where we concentrate on indigenous measures - strengthening, within the regions, the essential building blocks of self generating growth. And on tackling the imbalances that prevent economic strength: </p> <p>\u0095 First, bridging the investment and enterprise gap; </p> <p>\u0095 Second, bridging the skills gap; </p> <p>\u0095 Third, bridging the technology gap, including support for e-commerce; </p> <p>\u0095 Fourth, bridging the employment gap. </p> <p>Indeed, as these challenges suggest, now, as the economy starts to strengthen, is the perfect time to think not in a short termist way about our economic future but to think and plan long term; and to bring together strategic plans for our future. And I want to suggest that with the creation of the new regional development agencies - for which I believe John Prescott deserves our congratulations - we are not only recognising the many regional centres in Britain today and giving them new strength and powers. </p> <p>But we are creating, at a regional level, the economic policy instruments of the future: the measures that will foster innovation, develop the skills for the 21st century economy, build a strong enterprise culture open to all and help us lead in the digital revolution and ensure all of us benefit fully from our participation in Europe. But the emphasis is not simply on local needs but on local initiative. Our reforms show that we are entering an era in which national government, instead of directing, enables powerful regional and local initiatives to work, where Britain becomes as it should be - a Britain of nations and regions where there are many and not just one centre of initiative and energy for our country. With regional development agencies and the flexibilities we are offering them there is for the first time both a shared understanding of the challenges the region faces and a strategic means of meeting them. </p> <p>Investment and enterprise In our pre-budget consultation we welcome further proposals for encouraging enterprise in high unemployment areas. The 2001 budget - and our future plans will continue this government's policies to offer greater incentives to business, remove unacceptable barriers that prevent people with enterprise getting on and, from the classroom to the boardroom, widen and deepen the spirit of enterprise in Britain. The government's ambition is to make opportunity for all the foundation of a more dynamic enterprise economy, breaking free of the old dependency culture in high unemployment areas. </p> <p>In an enterprise budget we will consider extending capital gains tax relief and the 10p rate. </p> <p>In an enterprise budget we will consider extending our R and D tax credit by examining proposals to do so from the CBI, EEF and others interested in improving Britain's R and D effort.</p> <p>In an enterprise budget we will consult on new reliefs for corporation tax including for intellectual property. </p> <p>As we move to an enterprise budget we will consult on capital gains tax relief for the sale of substantial shareholdings. </p> <p>As we move to an enterprise budget we are considering improvements in our enterprise management incentive scheme, the share options we offer new and dynamic companies.</p> <p>As we move to an enterprise budget we will consider new incentives for urban renewal and inner city development. </p> <p>And an enterprise budget means measures to encourage an enterprise culture in high unemployment areas where the greatest need is not more benefit offices but more businesses as we move from a dependency culture based on entitlements to a dynamic business culture based on enterprise. </p> <p>Instead of acquiescing in the old giro culture - simply paying benefits to compensate people for their social exclusion - we must back success rather than accept failure. And to do that we must extend fiscal and other financial incentives that open up economic and business opportunity in high unemployment areas, and encourage and reward new enterprise. </p> <p>If we are to achieve higher start-up rates in high unemployment areas, economic stability is critically important to business confidence, as we found in the early '90s when the recession not only destroyed existing businesses but discouraged new ones. </p> <p>So in the budget our aim is to create the stronger enterprise culture that America enjoys, reduce the costs of business failure and address the sharp regional and local divergences in small business creation.</p> <p>Behind the creation of regional development agencies is our view that the way forward is one of empowering local people with skills and confidence. Indeed, our old cities and estates should be seen as new markets with competitive advantages - their strategic locations, their often untapped retail markets and the potential of their workforce.</p> <p>And so it is right to put in place the best possible incentive structure to stimulate business-led growth as well as much bigger flows of private investment. So, to meet the challenge of increasing private investment in high unemployment areas by \u00a31bn, we will now consult before the budget on targeted tax incentives in four areas - cuts in stamp duty, reduced business rates, changes in capital gains tax and a new community investment tax credit. But changing our culture to one that favours enterprise in every area needs not just incentives but a real shift in attitudes too. And that will come about quickest if it starts, not in the boardroom, but in our schools.</p> <p>I want every young person to hear about business and enterprise in school; every college student to be made aware of the opportunities in business; every teacher to be able to communicate the virtues and potential of business and enterprise. </p> <p>I want businessmen and women to visit our schools and talk to their enterprise classes; I want every student to have a quality experience of working in a local business before they leave school. I want management training scholarships to be available even in the poorest areas and I want every community to see business leaders as role models.</p> <p>Regional coordination and accountability. But let me say something more on our proposals for regional co-ordination - which will form our next five years' programme for economic growth in our country - and the central role we see for regional development agencies as the strategic leaders of economic policies in the regions - in employment, skills, innovation and regeneration. </p> <p>The New Deal has already brought into being new partnerships between companies, the world of education and training, and the employment service. Regional approaches to the delivery of the New Deal and to training will become ever more important. The enterprise centres mean companies, universities and government must work together. </p> <p>The regional approach to venture capital funds, coordinated by the regional development agencies and the small business service, again requires business and government to work in partnership. </p> <p>To benefit fully from the university for industry, companies, educational authorities, schools and colleges themselves will want to form new partnerships. And local government - casting aside any idea that it should look inwards - must, as it looks outwards, be involved in all these initiatives. </p> <p>And we are ensuring the resources and flexibilities that regional development agencies need, but in return we are demanding strenuous targets be met in skills, innovation, business creation, new technology and employment. </p> <p>This is the new regional policy - locally sensitive and locally delivered, local people meeting local needs through local agencies. </p> <p>At every regional level, businesses, local authorities and the world of education will want to work together on their bids for funds and resources, and at the same time to make their case not just in Britain but abroad. </p> <p>And in making this happen the new local and regional centres of initiative in this country will show that leadership in Britain can come from every regional capital as much as from London itself. </p> <p>But as we develop regional policies that are locally generated and managed there has to be local and regional accountability too. </p> <p>Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland moved from 1997 to elected bodies. The manifesto on which this government was elected set out the options for elected regional government in England where there is popular consent for it. </p> <p>As we expand regional institutions - regional government offices, regional development agencies - so too we must expand regional accountability. John Prescott and I believe that in the consideration of new and better regional systems of accountability we need a greater role for both the House of Commons and the regional chambers.</p> <p>I hope that the regional chambers established in every region will hold annual hearings to examine the RDAs' annual reports and review progress against their published strategies - and report back on their findings. We should ensure they have the resources to meet this duty. By extending the scope for region by region initiatives and by complimenting these with greater accountability at a regional level and through the select committee system in the Commons, we are proving our ability to ensure that regionally set objectives are met.</p> <p>Combined with our national economic policy measures for stability, productivity, skills and responsibility, the third generation regional policy that I am describing is in my view the route to full employment in each region, that is employment opportunity for each region's citizens.</p> <p>More than that, these are the means by which Britain is becoming a Britain of regions and nations with a new dynamism and where for locally generated initiatives we learn anew from each other, and where our diversity can become a source not only of new energy but of national strength. </p> <p>So our new development agencies both make sense of regional sentiment and respond to the challenges of the next millennium.</p> <p>Regions building new strengths from the ground upwards. </p> <p>Regions not looking in on themselves but looking outwards to the challenges of the global economy. </p> <p>Regions in which we make the connections so that schools and colleges, companies and local authorities work in a coordinated way for the same objectives - addressing inequalities within our regions. </p> <p> Conclusion </p> <p>I believe what is happening in each region today is showing the growing vitality of a new Britain, where there are new local and regional centres of initiative leading Britain. </p> <p>We are moving away from the old Britain of subjects where people had to look upwards to a Whitehall bureaucracy for their solutions - to a Britain of citizens where region to region, locality to locality we are ourselves in charge and where it is up to us.</p> <p>And where as a result Britain becomes stronger as each nation and region learns from another. </p> <p>In so many areas of our national life individual regions are leading the way. And what a strong country we can be when we are enriched by the different cultures and centres of initiative which together make up Britain. </p> <p>We are indeed stronger together, weaker apart. </p> <p>So, this morning I have suggested how we can strengthen our regional and national economy. I have said we must rediscover the national purpose that allows us to break from the old conflicts which have divided us. </p> <p>I look forward to a Britain in which instead of public versus private, state versus market, management versus workers, we have public and private, government and markets, employers and managers and workforces working together for the high levels of growth and employment we need for long term prosperity. </p> <p>I have pointed the way to full employment in this region in our generation. It is a challenge for all of us, a challenge that together we can meet and surmount.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The full text of Gordon Brown's speech, made today at the University of Manchester Science and Technology Institute. It is a pleasure to be here in Manchester this morning. For two centuries Manchester and the north-west have been a worldwide centre for manufacturing strength. This region led in the 19th century and now it can lead again. And let me say how pleased I am to be speaking here at UMIST. Founded early in the 19th century by the business community of Manchester, it enters the 21st century a leading centre for scientific research, its links with business stronger than ever - promoting growth, jobs and opportunity for the north-west region and beyond. Today I want to show how in the north-west and the other regions of our country, the high ideals and public purpose contained in the economic goal of 1944 can be achieved. Full employment - defined as in 1944 as 'high and stable levels of employment' - was a reality for the country as a whole for 20 years after the second world war. But not only did rising unemployment in the 1970s and beyond undermine these goals but so too did persistently higher unemployment in our regions. As recently as 1997, one in five working age households had no one in work in seven of our 12 regions and nations. Some believe that full employment can be achieved only by a return to macroeconomic fine tuning. Others believe that in the new more open economy governments cannot hope to meet the 1944 objectives. I reject both the dogma of insisting on old ways and the defeatism of abandoning the objectives. But to achieve full employment in all the regions is a large and ever present challenge and demands new approaches not the old ways. So since 1997 the new government has been putting in place a new framework to deliver our growth and employment objectives. Last year I set down four objectives: \u0095 First: stability - a pro-active monetary policy and prudent fiscal policy to deliver the necessary platform of stability; \u0095 Second: employability - a strengthening of the programme to move the unemployed from welfare to work; \u0095 Third: productivity - a commitment to high quality long term investment in science and innovation, new technology and skills; \u0095 Fourth: responsibility - avoiding short termism in pay and wage bargaining across the private and public sectors, and building a shared sense of national purpose. These conditions - requirements for stability, employability, productivity and responsibility - are and have always been the necessary conditions for full employment. The first condition, stability, is needed to ensure a sustainable high demand for labour. The second, employability, promotes a sustainable high supply of labour. The third, raising productivity, provides a sustainable basis for rising living standards. And the fourth, responsibility in bargaining, ensures a sustainable basis for combining full employment with low inflation. But there is a fifth condition I wish to discuss in detail today - the need for regionally balanced growth, essential if there is to be opportunity for all in all regions. Now the first generation of regional and urban policies - starting in the '30s - amounted essentially to ambulance work - first-aid measures, urgently needed assistance and relief in areas of high unemployment. The second generation of regional policies came in the '60s when then the emphasis was on large capital grants and tax incentives for regions anxious to encourage mobile capital into our regions as inward investment. Now we are entering a third generation of regional policies inaugurated by Stephen Byers, David Blunkett and John Prescott, where we concentrate on indigenous measures - strengthening, within the regions, the essential building blocks of self generating growth. And on tackling the imbalances that prevent economic strength: \u0095 First, bridging the investment and enterprise gap; \u0095 Second, bridging the skills gap; \u0095 Third, bridging the technology gap, including support for e-commerce; \u0095 Fourth, bridging the employment gap. Indeed, as these challenges suggest, now, as the economy starts to strengthen, is the perfect time to think not in a short termist way about our economic future but to think and plan long term; and to bring together strategic plans for our future. And I want to suggest that with the creation of the new regional development agencies - for which I believe John Prescott deserves our congratulations - we are not only recognising the many regional centres in Britain today and giving them new strength and powers. But we are creating, at a regional level, the economic policy instruments of the future: the measures that will foster innovation, develop the skills for the 21st century economy, build a strong enterprise culture open to all and help us lead in the digital revolution and ensure all of us benefit fully from our participation in Europe. But the emphasis is not simply on local needs but on local initiative. Our reforms show that we are entering an era in which national government, instead of directing, enables powerful regional and local initiatives to work, where Britain becomes as it should be - a Britain of nations and regions where there are many and not just one centre of initiative and energy for our country. With regional development agencies and the flexibilities we are offering them there is for the first time both a shared understanding of the challenges the region faces and a strategic means of meeting them. Investment and enterprise In our pre-budget consultation we welcome further proposals for encouraging enterprise in high unemployment areas. The 2001 budget - and our future plans will continue this government's policies to offer greater incentives to business, remove unacceptable barriers that prevent people with enterprise getting on and, from the classroom to the boardroom, widen and deepen the spirit of enterprise in Britain. The government's ambition is to make opportunity for all the foundation of a more dynamic enterprise economy, breaking free of the old dependency culture in high unemployment areas. In an enterprise budget we will consider extending capital gains tax relief and the 10p rate. In an enterprise budget we will consider extending our R and D tax credit by examining proposals to do so from the CBI, EEF and others interested in improving Britain's R and D effort. In an enterprise budget we will consult on new reliefs for corporation tax including for intellectual property. As we move to an enterprise budget we will consult on capital gains tax relief for the sale of substantial shareholdings. As we move to an enterprise budget we are considering improvements in our enterprise management incentive scheme, the share options we offer new and dynamic companies. As we move to an enterprise budget we will consider new incentives for urban renewal and inner city development. And an enterprise budget means measures to encourage an enterprise culture in high unemployment areas where the greatest need is not more benefit offices but more businesses as we move from a dependency culture based on entitlements to a dynamic business culture based on enterprise. Instead of acquiescing in the old giro culture - simply paying benefits to compensate people for their social exclusion - we must back success rather than accept failure. And to do that we must extend fiscal and other financial incentives that open up economic and business opportunity in high unemployment areas, and encourage and reward new enterprise. If we are to achieve higher start-up rates in high unemployment areas, economic stability is critically important to business confidence, as we found in the early '90s when the recession not only destroyed existing businesses but discouraged new ones. So in the budget our aim is to create the stronger enterprise culture that America enjoys, reduce the costs of business failure and address the sharp regional and local divergences in small business creation. Behind the creation of regional development agencies is our view that the way forward is one of empowering local people with skills and confidence. Indeed, our old cities and estates should be seen as new markets with competitive advantages - their strategic locations, their often untapped retail markets and the potential of their workforce. And so it is right to put in place the best possible incentive structure to stimulate business-led growth as well as much bigger flows of private investment. So, to meet the challenge of increasing private investment in high unemployment areas by \u00a31bn, we will now consult before the budget on targeted tax incentives in four areas - cuts in stamp duty, reduced business rates, changes in capital gains tax and a new community investment tax credit. But changing our culture to one that favours enterprise in every area needs not just incentives but a real shift in attitudes too. And that will come about quickest if it starts, not in the boardroom, but in our schools. I want every young person to hear about business and enterprise in school; every college student to be made aware of the opportunities in business; every teacher to be able to communicate the virtues and potential of business and enterprise. I want businessmen and women to visit our schools and talk to their enterprise classes; I want every student to have a quality experience of working in a local business before they leave school. I want management training scholarships to be available even in the poorest areas and I want every community to see business leaders as role models. Regional coordination and accountability. But let me say something more on our proposals for regional co-ordination - which will form our next five years' programme for economic growth in our country - and the central role we see for regional development agencies as the strategic leaders of economic policies in the regions - in employment, skills, innovation and regeneration. The New Deal has already brought into being new partnerships between companies, the world of education and training, and the employment service. Regional approaches to the delivery of the New Deal and to training will become ever more important. The enterprise centres mean companies, universities and government must work together. The regional approach to venture capital funds, coordinated by the regional development agencies and the small business service, again requires business and government to work in partnership. To benefit fully from the university for industry, companies, educational authorities, schools and colleges themselves will want to form new partnerships. And local government - casting aside any idea that it should look inwards - must, as it looks outwards, be involved in all these initiatives. And we are ensuring the resources and flexibilities that regional development agencies need, but in return we are demanding strenuous targets be met in skills, innovation, business creation, new technology and employment. This is the new regional policy - locally sensitive and locally delivered, local people meeting local needs through local agencies. At every regional level, businesses, local authorities and the world of education will want to work together on their bids for funds and resources, and at the same time to make their case not just in Britain but abroad. And in making this happen the new local and regional centres of initiative in this country will show that leadership in Britain can come from every regional capital as much as from London itself. But as we develop regional policies that are locally generated and managed there has to be local and regional accountability too. Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland moved from 1997 to elected bodies. The manifesto on which this government was elected set out the options for elected regional government in England where there is popular consent for it. As we expand regional institutions - regional government offices, regional development agencies - so too we must expand regional accountability. John Prescott and I believe that in the consideration of new and better regional systems of accountability we need a greater role for both the House of Commons and the regional chambers. I hope that the regional chambers established in every region will hold annual hearings to examine the RDAs' annual reports and review progress against their published strategies - and report back on their findings. We should ensure they have the resources to meet this duty. By extending the scope for region by region initiatives and by complimenting these with greater accountability at a regional level and through the select committee system in the Commons, we are proving our ability to ensure that regionally set objectives are met. Combined with our national economic policy measures for stability, productivity, skills and responsibility, the third generation regional policy that I am describing is in my view the route to full employment in each region, that is employment opportunity for each region's citizens. More than that, these are the means by which Britain is becoming a Britain of regions and nations with a new dynamism and where for locally generated initiatives we learn anew from each other, and where our diversity can become a source not only of new energy but of national strength. So our new development agencies both make sense of regional sentiment and respond to the challenges of the next millennium. Regions building new strengths from the ground upwards. Regions not looking in on themselves but looking outwards to the challenges of the global economy. Regions in which we make the connections so that schools and colleges, companies and local authorities work in a coordinated way for the same objectives - addressing inequalities within our regions. Conclusion I believe what is happening in each region today is showing the growing vitality of a new Britain, where there are new local and regional centres of initiative leading Britain. We are moving away from the old Britain of subjects where people had to look upwards to a Whitehall bureaucracy for their solutions - to a Britain of citizens where region to region, locality to locality we are ourselves in charge and where it is up to us. And where as a result Britain becomes stronger as each nation and region learns from another. In so many areas of our national life individual regions are leading the way. And what a strong country we can be when we are enriched by the different cultures and centres of initiative which together make up Britain. We are indeed stronger together, weaker apart. So, this morning I have suggested how we can strengthen our regional and national economy. I have said we must rediscover the national purpose that allows us to break from the old conflicts which have divided us. I look forward to a Britain in which instead of public versus private, state versus market, management versus workers, we have public and private, government and markets, employers and managers and workforces working together for the high levels of growth and employment we need for long term prosperity. I have pointed the way to full employment in this region in our generation. It is a challenge for all of us, a challenge that together we can meet and surmount.",

The international development secretary, Clare Short, told the Commons this afternoon the scene was one of \"utter devastation\" and aid from Britain would focus on the current priorities of \"water, shelter, blankets and fuel.\" She said: \"This is a very, very serious disaster. Organisation by the Indian government is good but international help is needed.\" Ms Short added that efforts must be made so that the survivors did not succumb to disease and that aid will help them until they can \"rebuild their homes and livelihoods\". The emergency relief donated by the UK included 3,280 blankets and 45 family tents, she said. In western India, rescue workers continued to search for survivors amid the rubble. The disaster has killed 6,181 people in the state of Gujarat, according to official figures, and the state's chief minister, Keshubhai Patel, has predicted that the death toll could reach 20,000. British rescue workers today remained optimistic about finding people alive amid the ruined buildings after the 69-member team pulled out four survivors yesterday, but officials in India said hopes of finding more survivors were fading. Paul Blewitt, with the rescue team Rapid UK in the city of Bhuj - one of the worst-hit areas - said: \"There are still a number of buildings yet to search and there is always that possibility. There is always a chance.\" Rescue efforts have been taking place in temperatures of 44C (110F) and conditions were extremely difficult. \"The temperature makes it more difficult to work and because there is no infrastructure there is no electricity or water,\" Mr Blewitt said. \"There is a trickle of bottled water and that is what's keeping us going.\" Sikh soldiers today pulled a 90-year-old woman alive from beneath the ruins of her home in Bhuj. The soldiers had used their hands and crowbars to rescue Cham Paten Seth, and they said she had survived because her head was protected by an old sewing machine.

So it seems all the more extraordinary that, potentially three months from an election, the duo appear intent on pouring the equivalent of a Saudi oilfield on Labour's troubles.</p> <p>All self-discipline appears to have abandoned as the New Labour family immolates one another in public. With such high emotions in play, it is difficult to predict where this drama will go next.</p> <p>Belatedly, Downing Street is today trying to cool matters down. The crisis appeared from nowhere, but does not look like it will blow itself out so rapidly. Either way, the government's reputation for arrogance has been confirmed.</p> <p>The central relationships at the heart of New Labour are in need of repair. The future of the Europe minister Keith Vaz is in doubt; Mr Mandelson is nursing a dangerously bruised ego and is determined to restore his reputation through the Hammond inquiry; and Mr Campbell needs to prove he is not a bull in a china shop.</p> <p>First, Mr Mandelson. He is now on a short holiday, and may find a cooler perspective in foreign climes. He may realise he will do nobody, least of all himself, any good by saying anything further. He could, after all, destroy this government. Tony Blair has no kept no secrets from him for more than a decade.</p> <p>If he is wise, he will reserve his thoughts for the Hammond inquiry in the hope that it will clear him of any wrongdoing.</p> <p>The inquiry, on the available evidence, is likely to rule that he did speak briefly to the Home Office minister Mike O'Brien about their passport application by the Hinduja brothers, but that there was no crime, or breach of the ministerial code, in doing so. The three-word record of the call - \"Mandelson, Hinduja, naturalisation\" - is in itself hardly illuminating.</p> <p>However, Mr Mandelson seems to be looking for a non-existent chink of light in hoping that his former officials, including his private office, will be able to show he never made any telephone contact with Mr O'Brien over the Hinduja brothers.</p> <p>After all, Mr O'Brien, a straight man, has no motive in recalling a conversation he never had. Equally, there is no reason for the Home Office officials to note contemporaneously a phone call that did not happen.</p> <p>Moreover, by Mr Mandelson's own admission, prior to speaking to the Observer 10 days ago, he was reminded of his contact with the Home Office over the affair. He has conceded that the night before the written answer to the Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker was published he was personally contacted by the home secretary, Jack Straw, over his role in the passport application.</p> <p>He has also conceded that he tried to keep his name out of the parliamentary written answer revealing his contact over the passport.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson has also conceded that he never told No 10 of this phone call with Mr Straw. Even if one accepts that he was slightly distracted or detached at the time of the crisis, it seems he let down his colleagues - and the prime minister - by being less than honest.</p> <p>So Mr Mandelson's reputation may be partially redeemed by the publication of the Hammond inquiry sometime at the end of next month, but his career and his reputation for politically judgement have been sealed.</p> <p>Mr Campbell, the No 10 spokesman, also needs to recover his poise. Mr Mandelson briefed him incorrectly, requiring him to make a retraction to newspaper journalists. For that, he cannot be blamed.</p> <p>But his briefing of the Sunday newspapers was either culpable for being casual or deliberately provocative. Campbell has always known that talking to the Sunday lobby newspaper lobby is one of the most treacherous occupations any politician can undertake.</p> <p>It is not just a case of walking on eggs. The briefer knows the eggs contain a large number of man-eating reptiles waiting to pounce. The Sunday lobby contains some of the sharpest operators in the business, and Mr Campbell seems to have been extraordinarily unguarded in their presence.</p> <p>Next, Mr Vaz. Did he become in some way beholden to the Hinduja brothers ? Why did he meet them so often? And during those meetings, did he give any improper advice to them as a minister as to how they could avoid extradition to India on corruption charges ?</p> <p>\"I am a leading member, if not the leading member, of the Asian community in this country,\" Mr Vaz recently declared. \"All kinds of people ask me for support.\"</p> <p>But for the moment Mr Vaz is saying little - and at present there looks like a lot more smoke than fire.</p> <p>It is not yet a resigning matter to be photographed alongside the Hinduja brothers. And if it is, William Hague is one of those who should be quitting.</p> <p><b>Special report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">New Labour in power</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,430539,00.html\">29.01.2001: Government races to complete passport inquiry</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430550,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: Julian Glover on New Labour</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,430305,00.html\">29.01.2001: Cabinet cuts off Mandelson</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430254,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430250,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430253,00.html\">29.01.2001: Brother deals new blow to Vaz</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430189,00.html\">29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430167,00.html\">29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,429979,00.html\">28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427850,00.html\">25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,427840,00.html\">25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/graphic/0,7367,428461,00.html\">Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427471,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done</a></p> <p><b>Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369240,00.html\">Mandelson resigns over his home loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369238,00.html\">Rivals in the Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,366690,00.html\">How Mandy replaced Mo</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7e6ee\">Have your say on the Mandelson affair</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/01/28/stifocnws02001.html\" target=\"_new\">Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageId=3284\" target=\"_new\">Downing Street press briefing</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a></p>",

If he is wise, he will reserve his thoughts for the Hammond inquiry in the hope that it will clear him of any wrongdoing. The inquiry, on the available evidence, is likely to rule that he did speak briefly to the Home Office minister Mike O'Brien about their passport application by the Hinduja brothers, but that there was no crime, or breach of the ministerial code, in doing so. The three-word record of the call - \"Mandelson, Hinduja, naturalisation\" - is in itself hardly illuminating. However, Mr Mandelson seems to be looking for a non-existent chink of light in hoping that his former officials, including his private office, will be able to show he never made any telephone contact with Mr O'Brien over the Hinduja brothers. After all, Mr O'Brien, a straight man, has no motive in recalling a conversation he never had. Equally, there is no reason for the Home Office officials to note contemporaneously a phone call that did not happen. Moreover, by Mr Mandelson's own admission, prior to speaking to the Observer 10 days ago, he was reminded of his contact with the Home Office over the affair. He has conceded that the night before the written answer to the Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker was published he was personally contacted by the home secretary, Jack Straw, over his role in the passport application. He has also conceded that he tried to keep his name out of the parliamentary written answer revealing his contact over the passport. Mr Mandelson has also conceded that he never told No 10 of this phone call with Mr Straw. Even if one accepts that he was slightly distracted or detached at the time of the crisis, it seems he let down his colleagues - and the prime minister - by being less than honest. So Mr Mandelson's reputation may be partially redeemed by the publication of the Hammond inquiry sometime at the end of next month, but his career and his reputation for politically judgement have been sealed. Mr Campbell, the No 10 spokesman, also needs to recover his poise. Mr Mandelson briefed him incorrectly, requiring him to make a retraction to newspaper journalists. For that, he cannot be blamed. But his briefing of the Sunday newspapers was either culpable for being casual or deliberately provocative. Campbell has always known that talking to the Sunday lobby newspaper lobby is one of the most treacherous occupations any politician can undertake. It is not just a case of walking on eggs. The briefer knows the eggs contain a large number of man-eating reptiles waiting to pounce. The Sunday lobby contains some of the sharpest operators in the business, and Mr Campbell seems to have been extraordinarily unguarded in their presence. Next, Mr Vaz. Did he become in some way beholden to the Hinduja brothers ? Why did he meet them so often? And during those meetings, did he give any improper advice to them as a minister as to how they could avoid extradition to India on corruption charges ? \"I am a leading member, if not the leading member, of the Asian community in this country,\" Mr Vaz recently declared. \"All kinds of people ask me for support.\" But for the moment Mr Vaz is saying little - and at present there looks like a lot more smoke than fire. It is not yet a resigning matter to be photographed alongside the Hinduja brothers. And if it is, William Hague is one of those who should be quitting.

Frances Crook, director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, concedes that Straw's watch has seen an improvement but is still disappointed. \"There are too many people in the system for a start.

Slopping out has virtually disappeared and conditions inside new prisons, whether private or state-run, are better, but overcrowding and the survival of a retrograde culture dominated by the Prison Officers' Association still blight many regimes. </p> <p>For Hurd, the chairman of the Prison Reform Trust, part of the problem lies in the fact that the political culture fails to take a real interest in prisons.

It is still the second highest in Europe, but Straw has capped it with the introduction of his home-detention curfew scheme. Last week some 1,633 prisoners were serving the last weeks of their sentences at home with an electronic tag. Despite Ann Widdecombe's attacks on the scheme, it has so far proved effective, with 96% successfully completing their sentences. If anything it is too cautious, and thousands more minor offenders could be let out with a tag without putting the public at risk. </p> <p>But this progress has come at a price. The expansion in literacy and numeracy classes has been bought at the expense of a wider educational programme. \"Art and sculpture classes don't help people into jobs,\" Narey has said. And overcrowding - 36 jails have more than 100 inmates \"doubled up\" in single cells - is still a barrier to any serious progress. </p> <p>The Woolf report clearly identified overcrowding as a cause of unrest. Then, more than 9,000 prisoners were sharing single cells. Now, according to official figures, there is sufficient accommodation for all but 500 prisoners. Hurd believes that, while the pressure is not as great as when he was home secretary, it is still a corrosive problem. \"There are a number of prisons, like Preston, which are more than 50% overcrowded, and there are lots of others where there is room, so the total figure does not convey the real pressures. The chances of getting education are less because the demands on the staff just to run the place take priority over everything else.\" </p> <p>The state of young offenders' institutions, particularly Feltham, is still a scandal, so much so that Lord Woolf declared that he could not recommend sending the two Bulger killers to one. The rapid rise in the number of women prisoners, and the continuing high rate of suicides, continue to pose their own problems. </p> <p>The obsession with security, triggered by the mid-1990s breakouts from Whitemoor and Parkhurst, has ensured that there have been no more category A escapes. But one recent casualty of this policy was Blantyre House, which had been the most successful resettlement prison in the system. MPs severely criticised the midnight raid on the jail as a completely unjustified \"self-inflicted wound\". </p> <p>The battle over the introduction of private prisons is over. The judgment passed by Sir David Ramsbotham, the chief inspector of prisons, is that the nine private jails have, by and large, delivered a higher standard of treatment for prisoners than the public sector. Even so, the pendulum is beginning to swing back to state-run jails. Now the threat of privatisation is being used to drive up standards in \"failing\" prisons, such as Brixton, but the private prison companies are not keen to get involved. </p> <p>What state are our prisons in?

The telecoms giant planned to float up to 25% of Yell as part of its debt reduction plans. However, it has been held back by an OFT inquiry into its Yellow Pages business. BT is now looking at a full demerger, which analysts say could reap the same financial benefits as a \u00a34bn share offering. \"The inquiry was supposed to have been done and dusted months ago and the flotation should have happened before Christmas,\" said a BT spokeswoman. \"But given the marketing conditions and the fact the OFT review has taken longer than expected, our decision to review our options is sensible.\" The OFT inquiry is examining the need for a price cap on advertising in the BT directories It is also looking at other restrictions set by the Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission in 1996. \"We are aware of BT's aim to float and we do not intend to disrupt its plans,\" said an OFT spokeswoman. She added the OFT's findings would be sent to the Department of Trade &amp; Industry in the near future. The plans for a full demerger of Yell have been widely trailed ahead of tonight's crunch meeting between the BT board and senior shareholders in the company. They are expected to push for a full-scale break-up of BT. The telecoms operator has a debt mountain of \u00a330bn.",

Public services are going to be the heart of the manifesto and the central issue of the election campaign. Labour will set out its various reform programmes and it will remind voters of the increased spending due to come on stream in April. But will any of this count as radical?</p> <p>Well, it depends what you mean. The government will almost certainly talk a radical game, speaking of the \"challenge\" of delivering \"world-class services\". It will contrast its commitment to improving services with the Conservatives' commitment to tax cuts.</p> <p>If you compare this kind of rhetoric - and the spending that goes with it - with that of the Conservative governments of the past 20 years it is certainly a huge change. But this is hardly a standard for radicalism. Compared with the quality of public services enjoyed by our European partners, and with what Labour has always believed in, it is no more than trying to protect the status quo.</p> <p>Yet of course there is something the government could do in this field which would count as radical. This would be to promise higher taxes. If UK public spending was raised closer to the European average (the shortfall is currently around \u00a345bn a year, the equivalent of our entire education budget) the achievement of world class services might become rather more likely. But this idea, you will not be surprised to hear, won't be appearing in the manifesto.</p> <p>So, for all the talk of radicalism, it seems unlikely - for good or ill - that the headline policies in Labour's election platform will merit that term. Yet we shouldn't dismiss the idea of a radical manifesto altogether. Tucked away in the small print there may well be hints of genuine innovation.</p> <p>Labour is likely to promise, for example, a small but significant policy of wealth-redistribution. Detailed research is now being done into the idea of giving all young people capital grants - probably in the form of \"baby bonds\", which accumulate over a child's lifetime and can be realised at 18.</p> <p>The manifesto seems likely to promise various \"work-life balance\" measures, such as paid parental and paternity leave. Meanwhile there are interesting ideas being worked out on making towns and cities more liveable - enlarging pedestrian areas, improving parks, cutting traffic, enhancing safety. New environmental policies are also on the table, including a major programme of investment in renewable energy and other sustainable technologies.</p> <p>None of these initiatives is likely to attract the headlines during the election. But it may yet be such \"little radicalisms\" that actually determine the character of Labour's second term.</p> <p>For the point about policy ideas such as these is that they embody new kinds of thinking about the relationship between the government, society and the individual. They concern the ways in which the state can redistribute opportunity directly to individuals; how it can help protect the quality of our personal lives against the growing time demands of the economy; how public spaces and the sense of community can be enhanced; how the economy might be restructured to achieve a dramatic reduction in environmental damage.</p> <p>These are not yet the dominant themes of progressive politics. But they could well become so. Look out for them in the manifesto: from little radicalisms big ideologies grow. During the first government of the 21st century they might even force us to rethink what \"radical\" means.</p> <p>\u0095 Michael Jacobs is general secretary of the Fabian Society, whose LSE conference at the weekend, Prospects for a Second Term, was sponsored by the Guardian.</p> <p><b>Useful link:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.fabian-society.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">The Fabian Society</a></p>",

Yet of course there is something the government could do in this field which would count as radical. This would be to promise higher taxes. If UK public spending was raised closer to the European average (the shortfall is currently around \u00a345bn a year, the equivalent of our entire education budget) the achievement of world class services might become rather more likely. But this idea, you will not be surprised to hear, won't be appearing in the manifesto. So, for all the talk of radicalism, it seems unlikely - for good or ill - that the headline policies in Labour's election platform will merit that term. Yet we shouldn't dismiss the idea of a radical manifesto altogether. Tucked away in the small print there may well be hints of genuine innovation. Labour is likely to promise, for example, a small but significant policy of wealth-redistribution. Detailed research is now being done into the idea of giving all young people capital grants - probably in the form of \"baby bonds\", which accumulate over a child's lifetime and can be realised at 18. The manifesto seems likely to promise various \"work-life balance\" measures, such as paid parental and paternity leave. Meanwhile there are interesting ideas being worked out on making towns and cities more liveable - enlarging pedestrian areas, improving parks, cutting traffic, enhancing safety. New environmental policies are also on the table, including a major programme of investment in renewable energy and other sustainable technologies. None of these initiatives is likely to attract the headlines during the election. But it may yet be such \"little radicalisms\" that actually determine the character of Labour's second term. For the point about policy ideas such as these is that they embody new kinds of thinking about the relationship between the government, society and the individual. They concern the ways in which the state can redistribute opportunity directly to individuals; how it can help protect the quality of our personal lives against the growing time demands of the economy; how public spaces and the sense of community can be enhanced; how the economy might be restructured to achieve a dramatic reduction in environmental damage. These are not yet the dominant themes of progressive politics. But they could well become so. Look out for them in the manifesto: from little radicalisms big ideologies grow. During the first government of the 21st century they might even force us to rethink what \"radical\" means. \u0095 Michael Jacobs is general secretary of the Fabian Society, whose LSE conference at the weekend, Prospects for a Second Term, was sponsored by the Guardian.

      "bodyText": "The inquiry into the Hinduja passport affair should be completed by the end of February, Downing Street said today. Sir Anthony Hammond has told the cabinet secretary, Sir Richard Wilson, that he hopes to complete his report within the next few weeks. In a statement released through No 10, Sir Anthony said: \"On the information currently available to me I would hope to conclude the inquiry by the end of February.\" The prime minister, Tony Blair, has promised that the report will be published. Mr Blair's official spokesman said today that Sir Anthony's terms of reference were wide enough to allow him to look into any aspect of the affair, which has so far led to the resignation of Peter Mandelson as Northern Ireland secretary and embroiled the Europe minister, Keith Vaz. Mr Blair's spokesman today again tried to draw a line under the issue, telling reporters: \"The prime minister set out the background to Peter's resignation in the Commons last week and I think it's pretty clear from today's press and broadcasts that you may not want to move on, but the government's got a lot to do. \"There's an inquiry into the facts of the application by SP Hinduja for his passport, which is being conducted by Sir Anthony Hammond. The background to Peter's resignation was set out by the prime minister last week. \"The prime minister made that statement based on his own judgment and knowledge. \"I don't intend to get into the position where every single little line that appears here, and line that appears there, we have to suspend the business of government so you can go out and talk about it. \"We are the government, the prime minister is the prime minister, we have a government to run and a country to run.\" The spokesman said neither he nor cabinet ministers had been ordered to be more circumspect in future in their comments on the affair. \"Headlines come and headlines go. Governments get on governing.\" Asked if he still regarded Mr Mandelson as a friend, the spokesman replied: \"I do. Yes.\" On Mr Mandelson's Sunday newspaper article which sought to vindicate his own position, the spokesman said simply: \"Peter wrote that article, and I know he's not around at the moment, but it's for him to explain it.\" Mr Mandelson is believed to have gone abroad, leaving the furore behind him. Earlier today, the bitter war of words between Downing Street and Mr Mandelson rumbled on amid claims that he was driven from government to meet a media deadline. Best-selling author Robert Harris, who is a close friend of the former cabinet minister, said that Mr Mandelson was standing by his account of his role in the so-called \"passport-for-favours\" affair. Mr Harris attacked the prime minister's press secretary, Alastair Campbell, for briefing Sunday lobby journalists for 10 minutes last week about Mr Mandelson's \"mental stability\". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Harris alleged that Mr Mandelson had been \"browbeaten\" into resigning without the full facts having been made available. Mr Mandelson was sticking to his original account that officials in his private office had handled the query to the Home Office as to whether a change in government policy would affect Mr Hinduja's chances of getting a passport, he said. Mr Harris said that Mr Mandelson still had no recollection of making a telephone call to Home Office minister Mike O'Brien. The author said there was no official transcript of the \"alleged\" conversation and the Home Office note simply had the three words \"Mandelson, Hinduja, naturalisation.\" \"He is absolutely confident that what he originally thought and said that the contact between his office and the Home Office on this matter was handled by his private secretary,\" Mr Harris said. \"He cannot still recall this conversation that he is alleged to have had with Mike O'Brien. \"He doesn't think Mike O'Brien is a liar so obviously there could have been a conversation. He just cannot remember it.\" Mr Harris also criticised the way that Downing Street handled the resignation and said that if Mr Mandelson had been given more time he would have been able to produce the evidence from his former officials in the cabinet office to support his version of events. \"I think certainly it was unfortunate, to put it mildly, that the whole of this affair seems to have turned on having the news ready to give to the morning lobby meeting at 11 o'clock in Downing Street on Wednesday,\" he said. \"If that briefing had been postponed by maybe only an hour, then the information that Peter Mandelson's private secretary handled this whole thing would have been in the prime minister's hands. \"To the extent that the whole thing was being driven by a media deadline - that is a very bad thing.\" Mr Harris also criticised reported remarks by Mr Campbell to journalists that Mr Mandelson had become \"slightly detached\" - a comment that Downing Street insisted was taken out of context. \"I think it is a pretty poor thing to have a civil servant ruminating for 10 minutes about the mental stability of a former government minister. That seems strange to put it mildly.\" Special reports New Labour in power Peter Mandelson Related articles 29.01.2001, analysis: The Mandelson row - inside New Labour 29.01.2001: Cabinet cuts off Mandelson 29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows 29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached' 29.01.2001: Brother deals new blow to Vaz 29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control 29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important 28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go 25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins 25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me Audio 24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement Photo gallery Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures Cartoon Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson The 1998 home loan row Text of resignation letter 24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan 24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour Mandelson resigns over his home loan Rivals in the Labour party How Mandy replaced Mo Talk about it Have your say on the Mandelson affair Useful links 26.1.2001: Lobby press briefing on Vaz/Mandelson - 10 Downing Street Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001 24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement Hinduja group history Downing Street press briefing Hartlepool Mail",

      "body": "<p>Western India, El Salvador, Turkey - with tens of thousands of people dead in major earthquakes in the last two years, relatives and friends of those killed must be asking if the devastation could have been avoided. </p> <p>Earthquake prediction, though, is still more alchemy than science. Scientists have long been able to predict roughly where earthquakes will happen, but they have been less successful in telling us when a major quake will strike.</p> <p>As Gujarat's chief minister pointed out when criticised for not responding fast enough, an earthquake is not a cyclone. And no warning means no rescue efforts can be deployed until after the event. </p> <p>If scientists could give governments even a few hours of notice, lives could be saved with advance planning of a rescue operation that could dig out survivors that precious few hours faster. International rescue workers could be on the scene by the time the quake happened, rather than heading for their local airports several hours after the fact.</p> <p>Even better, notice of a day or more could lead to an evacuation that could cut casualties to virtually zero.</p> <p>Worldwide each year there are about 18 earthquakes with a magnitude of 7.0 or larger, according to the US Geological survey. Actual numbers since 1900 range from lows of six or seven quakes each year in 1986 and 1990 to a high of 41major earthquakes in 1943, the most seismically active year of the 20th century.</p> <p>Only one of them has ever been predicted in the level of detail needed to evacuate a city. </p> <p>Theories that these major earthquakes could be predicted came to nothing until 1975, when the Chinese government acted on the word of scientists and evacuated millions from the city of Haicheng. One day later, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake hit the city. Advance warning had saved thousands of lives.</p> <p>But the prediction in the Haicheng quake relied on very specific warnings, such as changes in land elevation and ground water levels in the months leading up to the quake. More importantly, a number of foreshocks had shaken the area. </p> <p>Sadly, most major earthquakes are not so co-operative, and in 1976 China lost a quarter of a million people when a 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck Tangshan with no warning at all.

      "bodyText": "Western India, El Salvador, Turkey - with tens of thousands of people dead in major earthquakes in the last two years, relatives and friends of those killed must be asking if the devastation could have been avoided. Earthquake prediction, though, is still more alchemy than science. Scientists have long been able to predict roughly where earthquakes will happen, but they have been less successful in telling us when a major quake will strike. As Gujarat's chief minister pointed out when criticised for not responding fast enough, an earthquake is not a cyclone. And no warning means no rescue efforts can be deployed until after the event. If scientists could give governments even a few hours of notice, lives could be saved with advance planning of a rescue operation that could dig out survivors that precious few hours faster. International rescue workers could be on the scene by the time the quake happened, rather than heading for their local airports several hours after the fact. Even better, notice of a day or more could lead to an evacuation that could cut casualties to virtually zero. Worldwide each year there are about 18 earthquakes with a magnitude of 7.0 or larger, according to the US Geological survey. Actual numbers since 1900 range from lows of six or seven quakes each year in 1986 and 1990 to a high of 41major earthquakes in 1943, the most seismically active year of the 20th century. Only one of them has ever been predicted in the level of detail needed to evacuate a city. Theories that these major earthquakes could be predicted came to nothing until 1975, when the Chinese government acted on the word of scientists and evacuated millions from the city of Haicheng. One day later, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake hit the city. Advance warning had saved thousands of lives. But the prediction in the Haicheng quake relied on very specific warnings, such as changes in land elevation and ground water levels in the months leading up to the quake. More importantly, a number of foreshocks had shaken the area. Sadly, most major earthquakes are not so co-operative, and in 1976 China lost a quarter of a million people when a 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck Tangshan with no warning at all. Haicheng remains the only example of a successful evacuation before a major earthquake. Scientists had predicted the 6.9 magnitude earthquake that killed 63 people in San Francisco in 1989, but not with anything close to the degree of accuracy necessary to evacuate an entire metropolitan area on a specific date. They simply knew that the fault, known as Loma Prieta, had not moved as much as points further north of it, putting immense pressure on the faultline. The US Geological Survey now only spends about 20% of its budget on earthquake prediction research, focusing instead on mitigating the effects of earthquakes once they strike. Rather than predicting earthquakes, seismologists spend their time trying to understand how earthquakes affect the land and the buildings that stand on it. This information is the basis of California's strict building codes and the frequent attempts to retrofit older buildings and highways to withstand whatever the state's unstable tectonic plates may have in store for residents. The results have saved countless lives: when Los Angeles was shaken by a 6.7 magnitude quake in 1994, the retrofitted buildings in West Hollywood performed best, remaining intact rather than crushing their inhabitants. In contrast, the majority of the 14,000 people killed in the 1999 earthquake in Turkey died after being buried alive in the rubble of sub-standard buildings. Many of the deaths occurred not because the country lacks appropriate building codes, but because they were not enforced. The safety of buildings is important, but so is the land on which the building sits.

They heard the faint sobbing of a baby amidst mounds of debris of a building in this town. Hours later, rescuers pulled out Naina Badrasen and her one-and half-year-old daughter Namrata. While Namrata, her pulse weak after spending 50 hours without food and water, was rushed to a nearby hospital, her mother died before rescue workers could reach her.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.expressindia.com\">Indian Express</a> has a grim prediction that the death toll could rise beyond 30,000. As many as one lakh people (100,000) could still be trapped in the debris. The paper tersely sums up: \"Although there was still no clear picture as yet even about the approximate death toll, nearly 7,000 bodies have so far been extricated from the rubble by various rescue teams, even as excavation of bodies in the worst-hit areas of Kutch district like Bhachau, Anjar and Rapar was yet to begin in right earnest. Nearly 12,000 injured people were being treated in various private or government hospitals, dispensaries and tents, an official said here this afternoon. In Kutch district, where thousands of casual workers from Rajasthan, Orissa and other states worked alone on salt farms, the authorities had began to bury the unclaimed bodies for want of any claimants.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.telegraphindia.com\">Telegraph, Calcutta </a> in Calcutta highlights the new horror of hunger in the devastation: \"With relief reaching slowly, survivors of the quake hunted for food and water in shops that still stood on the ground. \"It is a major catastrophe here. The priority is food because shops are being emptied out,\" said a Red Cross official. Villagers injured in the quake were trekking or piling on to whatever vehicles they could find to get to cities in search of medical help. Some died on the way. Injured people had reached even Ahmedabad, about 10 hours drive from Bhuj, to find hospitals overflowing with the dead and the barely living. A corridor at VS Hospital in Ahmedabad was crammed with bodies.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.timesofindia.com\">Times of India</a> reports that in their desperation, survivors of the earthquake have taken to looting relief supplies: \"Having gone without food, water and relief for four days after the earthquake struck Gujarat, survivors of the devastation in Kutch district have started looting vehicles carrying food packets and other relief material even as the over-stretched administration was yet to come to terms with the magnitude of the disaster. Officials in the earthquake control rooms in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar said there was utter chaos on the roads leading to Bhuj, Bachhau, Rapar and Anjar in Kutch districts where the earthquake victims were pouncing upon vehicles arriving with relief material.\" </p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.dailypioneer.com\">The Pioneer</a> in Delhi, the quake is the worst natural disaster to befall India since independence in 1947, and could derail government plans for radical economic reform. In the immediate future, there are likely to be new taxes in the imminent budget, to pay for reconstruction in Gujarat: \"As the calamity's appalling costs begin to become evident, a meeting of senior ministers convened by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Sunday evening began the process of factoring in the damage into the Budget... The meeting, which was the third in the New Year, was expected to focus on widening and accelerating economic reforms. The previous two meetings have concentrated on identifying sectors of the economy where reforms needed a kick-start and on measures on how to incorporate this into the Budget. The meeting on Sunday was completely devoted to the earthquake which has flattened out cities and villages in Kutch and hit one of the nation's most progressive and forward-looking state in the gut.\" </p> <p>The Bombay paper, the <a href=\"http://www.afternoondc.com\"> Afternoon, Bombay</a>, highlights the call of the Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh for donations to help the neighbouring state of Gujarat: \"Addressing an all-party meeting at the state secretariat yesterday, Mr. Deshmukh said it was the moral responsibility of Maharashtra to reach out to its neighbouring state in its time of crisis and all efforts would be made to extend aid in the form of funds, relief material and man power.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.deccan.com\">Deccan Chronicle, Hyderabad </a>, in central India, points up the devastating economic loss in the country's second most prosperous state. The paper estimates that at least 5,000 crores of rupees of damage has been caused. (A crore is 10 million, making the figure equivalent to nearly \u00a3850m.) And that is only a preliminary estimate: \"The State attracts the cream of domestic and multinational investment. Friday's quake has not only caused tremendous loss of life and property, but also damaged infrastructure such as telecommunications, roads, power supplies and railways. The cumulative damage is believed to be in the region of Rs 2,000 crore. CII [Confederation of Indian Industry] chief Tarun Das estimates the loss to be Rs 5,000 crore and if the devastation continues for another week, the loss might go up to Rs 8,000 crore.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.economictimes.com/today/pagehome.htm\"> Economic Times</a> in Bombay also looks at the crippling economic burden imposed by the earthquake, and comes up with an even higher figure: \"The government has asked the World Bank for $1bn and the Asian Development Bank for $500m to help rebuild the state which has a population of 41.3m people. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry put building and construction losses across Gujarat at about Rs 15,000 crore.\"</p>",

The priority is food because shops are being emptied out,\" said a Red Cross official. Villagers injured in the quake were trekking or piling on to whatever vehicles they could find to get to cities in search of medical help. Some died on the way. Injured people had reached even Ahmedabad, about 10 hours drive from Bhuj, to find hospitals overflowing with the dead and the barely living. A corridor at VS Hospital in Ahmedabad was crammed with bodies.\" The Times of India reports that in their desperation, survivors of the earthquake have taken to looting relief supplies: \"Having gone without food, water and relief for four days after the earthquake struck Gujarat, survivors of the devastation in Kutch district have started looting vehicles carrying food packets and other relief material even as the over-stretched administration was yet to come to terms with the magnitude of the disaster. Officials in the earthquake control rooms in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar said there was utter chaos on the roads leading to Bhuj, Bachhau, Rapar and Anjar in Kutch districts where the earthquake victims were pouncing upon vehicles arriving with relief material.\" According to the The Pioneer in Delhi, the quake is the worst natural disaster to befall India since independence in 1947, and could derail government plans for radical economic reform. In the immediate future, there are likely to be new taxes in the imminent budget, to pay for reconstruction in Gujarat: \"As the calamity's appalling costs begin to become evident, a meeting of senior ministers convened by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Sunday evening began the process of factoring in the damage into the Budget... The meeting, which was the third in the New Year, was expected to focus on widening and accelerating economic reforms. The previous two meetings have concentrated on identifying sectors of the economy where reforms needed a kick-start and on measures on how to incorporate this into the Budget. The meeting on Sunday was completely devoted to the earthquake which has flattened out cities and villages in Kutch and hit one of the nation's most progressive and forward-looking state in the gut.\" The Bombay paper, the Afternoon, Bombay, highlights the call of the Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh for donations to help the neighbouring state of Gujarat: \"Addressing an all-party meeting at the state secretariat yesterday, Mr. Deshmukh said it was the moral responsibility of Maharashtra to reach out to its neighbouring state in its time of crisis and all efforts would be made to extend aid in the form of funds, relief material and man power.\" The Deccan Chronicle, Hyderabad , in central India, points up the devastating economic loss in the country's second most prosperous state. The paper estimates that at least 5,000 crores of rupees of damage has been caused. (A crore is 10 million, making the figure equivalent to nearly \u00a3850m.) And that is only a preliminary estimate: \"The State attracts the cream of domestic and multinational investment. Friday's quake has not only caused tremendous loss of life and property, but also damaged infrastructure such as telecommunications, roads, power supplies and railways. The cumulative damage is believed to be in the region of Rs 2,000 crore. CII [Confederation of Indian Industry] chief Tarun Das estimates the loss to be Rs 5,000 crore and if the devastation continues for another week, the loss might go up to Rs 8,000 crore.\" The Economic Times in Bombay also looks at the crippling economic burden imposed by the earthquake, and comes up with an even higher figure: \"The government has asked the World Bank for $1bn and the Asian Development Bank for $500m to help rebuild the state which has a population of 41.3m people. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry put building and construction losses across Gujarat at about Rs 15,000 crore.\"",

      "body": "<p>It is a reliable maxim in Italian football that whenever a coach announces he is leaving for pastures new at the end of the season, his side are duty bound to become distracted. Marcello Lippi and Sven-Goran Eriksson led the way in this particular field, and Fatih Terim could well be next.</p> <p> The Fiorentina coach had steered his Batigol-free side to an unlikely third position in the Scudetto, before announcing last week he would be saying arrivederci - or more likely Allahaismarladik seeing as he still speaks little Italian - in June. Cue more protests from the volatile Viola fans, who yesterday packed the Artemio Franchi stadium to offer their support.</p> <p>But despite the vociferous chanting and waving of several large Turkish flags, the Fiorentina players couldn't respond. They were simply busted up by Dino Zoff's resurgent Lazio side, who withstood half-an-hours worth of Rui Costa inspired pressure before running away with the game 4-1. </p> <p>Goals from Pavel Nedved and Hernan Crespo (2) - who is now, shock-horror, playing like a \u00a336m striker - took the game out of reach early in the second half, and although Enrico Chiesa responded with a late penalty, Lazio had time to score a fourth through Marcelo Salas.</p> <p>While the result puts pressure on Terim, whose players later blamed fatigue for the defeat, it only confirms Lazio's resurgence under gruff coach Dino Zoff. The champions are unbeaten since the former Italian coach took charge, and he was delighted - well, for him - at yesterday's result.</p> <p>\"Today everything went well,\" he said. \"We played well, we attacked a lot and we scored four goals on a difficult ground. I like this Lazio. We've played well in the last three matches and I think we can reach whatever target we decide to set ourselves.\" </p> <p>With Lazio in third place - within striking distance of Roma and Juventus - that target must surely include the Scudetto.</p> <p><strong>Filippo flips</strong></p> <p>In Washington the chattering classes debate the merits of George Bush. In London talk centres on Mandelgate II. But in Turin, as always, the discussion is about Alessandro Del Piero. </p> <p>Once he was the darling of the Stadio Delle Alpi. But this week he was so frustrated at being the third choice striker behind Filippo Inzaghi and David Trezeguet he threatened to ditch his rumoured \u00a3100,000-a-week contract with Juve and join an unspecified foreign club at the end of the season.</p> <p>\"Crikey,\" thought the fans. But such talk cut no ice with coach Carlo Ancelotti, who once again left Del Piero out of his side for the visit of Vicenza. After only 13 minutes however, Del Piero's fortunes changed. Trezeguet hobbled off with an injury, and Juve's golden boy was given his chance to impress. </p> <p>By and large he took it, getting involved in most of Juve's attacking play. But despite showing some sublime touches during the first half he was outshone by Inzaghi, who scored a hat-trick and set up a goal for Edgar Davids during Juve's 4-0 win. </p> <p>Afterwards the never-modest Inzaghi had a thinly veiled message for his striking partner, telling Italia Uno's Controcampo sports programme: \"I must now be the No 1 choice at Juventus. I am the man scoring goals and I am the best person to play.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile Juve president Umberto Agnelli tried to reassure Del Piero that his future lies with the La Vecchia Signora. \"Del Piero played really well. I'm confident that he can be just as good a player as he was before his injury,\" he insisted. But even Del Piero's staunchest fans must have their doubts, despite their man's performance yesterday. </p> <p><strong>Roma revive</strong></p> <p>After wheezing like an asthmatic with a cold in recent weeks Roma are back on track. They thrashed Napoli 3-0 with goals from Marco Delvecchio, Francesco Totti and Gabriel Batistuta to stay three points clear of Juventus.</p> <p>Come rain or shine, win or defeat, Roma coach Fabio Capello never gets too animated however. \"I know there is a long way to go yet,\" was his post-match reaction. \"There are still so many matches - and so many difficult matches - to play.

      "bodyText": "It is a reliable maxim in Italian football that whenever a coach announces he is leaving for pastures new at the end of the season, his side are duty bound to become distracted. Marcello Lippi and Sven-Goran Eriksson led the way in this particular field, and Fatih Terim could well be next. The Fiorentina coach had steered his Batigol-free side to an unlikely third position in the Scudetto, before announcing last week he would be saying arrivederci - or more likely Allahaismarladik seeing as he still speaks little Italian - in June. Cue more protests from the volatile Viola fans, who yesterday packed the Artemio Franchi stadium to offer their support. But despite the vociferous chanting and waving of several large Turkish flags, the Fiorentina players couldn't respond. They were simply busted up by Dino Zoff's resurgent Lazio side, who withstood half-an-hours worth of Rui Costa inspired pressure before running away with the game 4-1. Goals from Pavel Nedved and Hernan Crespo (2) - who is now, shock-horror, playing like a \u00a336m striker - took the game out of reach early in the second half, and although Enrico Chiesa responded with a late penalty, Lazio had time to score a fourth through Marcelo Salas. While the result puts pressure on Terim, whose players later blamed fatigue for the defeat, it only confirms Lazio's resurgence under gruff coach Dino Zoff. The champions are unbeaten since the former Italian coach took charge, and he was delighted - well, for him - at yesterday's result. \"Today everything went well,\" he said. \"We played well, we attacked a lot and we scored four goals on a difficult ground. I like this Lazio. We've played well in the last three matches and I think we can reach whatever target we decide to set ourselves.\" With Lazio in third place - within striking distance of Roma and Juventus - that target must surely include the Scudetto. Filippo flips In Washington the chattering classes debate the merits of George Bush. In London talk centres on Mandelgate II. But in Turin, as always, the discussion is about Alessandro Del Piero. Once he was the darling of the Stadio Delle Alpi. But this week he was so frustrated at being the third choice striker behind Filippo Inzaghi and David Trezeguet he threatened to ditch his rumoured \u00a3100,000-a-week contract with Juve and join an unspecified foreign club at the end of the season. \"Crikey,\" thought the fans. But such talk cut no ice with coach Carlo Ancelotti, who once again left Del Piero out of his side for the visit of Vicenza. After only 13 minutes however, Del Piero's fortunes changed. Trezeguet hobbled off with an injury, and Juve's golden boy was given his chance to impress. By and large he took it, getting involved in most of Juve's attacking play. But despite showing some sublime touches during the first half he was outshone by Inzaghi, who scored a hat-trick and set up a goal for Edgar Davids during Juve's 4-0 win. Afterwards the never-modest Inzaghi had a thinly veiled message for his striking partner, telling Italia Uno's Controcampo sports programme: \"I must now be the No 1 choice at Juventus. I am the man scoring goals and I am the best person to play.\" Meanwhile Juve president Umberto Agnelli tried to reassure Del Piero that his future lies with the La Vecchia Signora. \"Del Piero played really well. I'm confident that he can be just as good a player as he was before his injury,\" he insisted. But even Del Piero's staunchest fans must have their doubts, despite their man's performance yesterday. Roma revive After wheezing like an asthmatic with a cold in recent weeks Roma are back on track. They thrashed Napoli 3-0 with goals from Marco Delvecchio, Francesco Totti and Gabriel Batistuta to stay three points clear of Juventus. Come rain or shine, win or defeat, Roma coach Fabio Capello never gets too animated however. \"I know there is a long way to go yet,\" was his post-match reaction. \"There are still so many matches - and so many difficult matches - to play. We didn't lose courage after last week, which was good, because a defeat in the San Siro against Milan is always possible. But, of course, we are not in raptures after this win.\" Napoli coach Emiliano Mondonico was equally pragmatic. \"I think that a three-goal gap is real between my team and Roma,\" he agreed. \"Sometimes football respects the respective value of teams and at others the players can balance the technical gap, but unfortunately this didn't happen. \"Nothing has changed for us after today's defeat,\" he went on. \"We are still one point below safety and, realistically, we can't expect to take points off teams as powerful as Roma. But all my players did their best today. We had two good chances during the first half, but we couldn't score. When Roma increased the tempo it was difficult to stop their players.\" The best of the rest Elsewhere in Serie A, Parma won 2-0 at Verona after two goals from Marco Di Vaio, handing Arrigo Saachi his first victory since returning to the Gialloblu. AC Milan only managed a 1-1 draw away at Brescia, with coach Alberto Zaccheroni using the same excuse as Terim, fatgue, for his players running out of steam (the two sides had met in the Coppa Italia in midweek, so perhaps that had something to do with it). Not surprisingly Brescia coach Carlo Mazzone - the Big Ron of Italian football - had a different take on the match. \"It was a great result against a team who did not come here for a walk in the park but were determined to take away all three points,\" he said. At the San Siro, Internazionale's \u00a331m striker Christian Vieri was once again booed by supporters after missing several chances. But Vieri had the last laugh: he scored the winning goal as Inter squeezed past bottom-placed Bari 1-0. Despite widespread talk of a crisis at the club, Inter's season isn't yet over. Yesterday's win puts them seven points clear of the relegation zone - and more importantly just four points behind Fiorentina, who currently occupy the fourth Champions League spot.

The health secretary, Alan Milburn, is expected to announce changes in the law following the publication of a report on the Alder Hey organs scandals. Dr Michael Wilks, chairman of the British Medical Association's medical ethics committee, agreed that legal uncertainties clearly needed to be resolved. He said the Department of Health had recently consulted the BMA's ethics committee about developing new guidance for the profession on consent. \"Doctors have a duty to act within the law but their professional obligations to observe high ethical standards go far beyond the letter of the law,\" he said. \"Doctors know that obtaining informed consent is a much more complex process than simply obtaining a signature. The discussions between doctor and patient about diagnosis, treatment options, the risk of complications and the prospects of recovery are all part of gaining informed consent.

He said: \"The practice of removing organs without consent probably stopped when the first scandal broke but the law needs to be changed to restore public confidence in the profession.\" In a speech to patient groups in London, Mr Milburn hinted that sweeping changes in practice and policy would be introduced to ensure patients give informed consent to the use of organs and tissues. The health secretary acknowledged that the Alder Hey scandal and the independent inquiry into heart operations at the Bristol Royal Infirmary have dented public trust in the health service. The Alder Hey report, which health officials describe as shocking, is expected to reveal how thousands of organs were removed from dead babies at the Liverpool hospital without their parents' knowledge. Parents were unaware that by signing consent forms for their children's operations, they were also giving doctors permission to remove and retain organs including the heart, lungs and nervous systems. Mr Milburn added: \"Above all else, for trust to thrive there has to be informed consent.

      "bodyText": "The Popstars ratings juggernaut continued to gather momentum on Saturday night, adding another million viewers to ITV's early evening audience. Saturday saw the number of musicbiz wannabes left in the show whittled down from 33 to 10, with cocky Darius Danesh among the cast-offs. The show had 8.6m and a 39% share, according to unofficial overnights. That was 1.1m up on the Popstars audience last week and nearly 2m more than its debut in the 6.15-7.15pm Saturday night slot a fortnight ago. The show's share of 16 to 34-year-olds also continues to climb. On Saturday Popstars pulled in a whopping 51% of this demographic. ITV director of programmes David Liddiment has reacted swiftly to the success of Popstars, scheduling an extra edition at 8pm on Wednesday and another peaktime edition for Saturday, when the identity of the five Popstars band members will finally be revealed. However, ITV's other major new reality format, daytime show Public Property, proved less successful in its first week. Public Property is a real life soap revolving around six participants, who allow the show's viewers to decide what direction their lives take for 12 weeks. The show, which is stripped daily between 5.05pm and 5.35pm, averaged 1.9m and a 13% share across its first week. Admittedly it was in a tough slot, sandwiched between The Weakest Link on BBC2 and Channel 4's Pet Rescue, which drew 5m and 2.7m, respectively, across last week. But the previous week ITV gameshow Family Fortunes averaged 2.9m and a 21% share over five days in the same slot. Channel 5 reality show The Mole continued its ratings slide between 8pm and 9pm on Friday night. The Mole dipped to 0.9m and a 4% share, 0.5m below its debut two weeks earlier.",

      "bodyText": "US cable TV mogul John Malone is in crunch talks about buying a stake in BSkyB in a complicated move triggered by the collapse of Rupert Murdoch's plans to float Sky Global Networks. The Denver-based boss of Liberty Media now holds the key to the future of Rupert Murdoch's satellite TV interests and is exploring the possibility of buying the 22.7% BSkyB stake owned by French media giant Vivendi Universal. The talks follow Vivendi's decision to sell its stake in order to win European Commission approval for its \u00a350bn merger with Seagram. Mr Malone is already a pivotal figure in News Corporation with a 20% holding in Mr Murdoch's media empire. Mr Murdoch is running out of options to realise his dream of floating the \u00a327bn satellite TV company after a merger with US operator DirecTV stalled on Friday night. One option under consideration is a merger of Mr Murdoch's existing TV companies, which include Asian broadcaster Star TV and BSkyB. But Mr Murdoch is desperate to get his hands on DirecTV - part of the General Motors group - because it is the only satellite operator in the US with more than 9m subscribers. \"It looks like Mr Murdoch will have to choose different options, which will involve News Corporation, DirecTV, John Malone, Liberty Media and Vivendi Universal. They have to organise something,\" said Marc Loneux, media analyst at Commerzbank. Mr Loneux added that any enlargement of BSkyB would be scrutinised by a sceptical market. \"The only big asset in Sky Global is BSkyB. They may inject assets into BSkyB, and the market will not like it,\" he added. Vivendi Universal could also take Liberty Media's stake in television programming business USA Networks, although a short-term stake in Sky Global is still possible if regulators allow it. A spokesman for BSkyB said the future of the Vivendi stake was a matter for the respective companies' shareholders. Mr Murdoch faces some challenging strategic decisions over the next few months, as the failure to link up with DirecTV, the leading satellite broadcaster in the US, will leave Sky Global without a vital US foothold. Such a gap is likely to scupper any plans for a flotation, leaving him with the lesser option of merging his existing companies. General Motors admitted at the weekend it was talking to several merger partners, and the recent drop in News Corporation's share price appears to have raised serious doubts about linking up with Mr Murdoch.

      "body": "<p><strong>What is Liberty Media Group?</strong><br> It is a US-based cable TV company that also has interests in technology and the internet across Europe, South America and Asia. It is run by John Malone, a highly respected operator, whose no-nonsense-style has earned him the nickname Darth Vader.</p> <p><strong>Who owns Liberty?</strong><br> It is 100%-owned by US telecoms giant AT&amp;T but Mr Malone's board has complete independence and Liberty is expected to be spun off from AT&amp;T in the summer.</p> <p><strong>What does Liberty own?</strong><br> An awful lot. It has 9% of Time Warner, 49% of the Discovery Channels, 25% of UK cable operator Telewest and 21% of TV programming business USA Networks. Most importantly, Liberty holds 20% of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.</p> <p><strong> How did it get involved with NewsCorp?</strong><br> Mr Murdoch recently bought Liberty's stake in interactive TV guide group Gemstar-TV, and let Mr Malone up his holding in NewsCorp. </p> <p><strong> How strong is the Murdoch-Malone link?</strong><br> Mr Murdoch needs strategic allies in the US, which makes 70% of NewsCorp's revenues. But he also needs a friendly buyer for the 22.7% stake in BSkyB, which is being sold by French media giant Vivendi Universal. Mr Malone has the cash - and the ability to execute complicated share swaps - to pull off such a move.</p> <p><strong> How else can Mr Malone help?</strong><br> He could team up with Mr Murdoch to buy DirecTV, the much-coveted satellite TV company owned by General Motors. If Mr Murdoch gets hold of DirecTV, he can float his Sky Global Networks satellite broadcast company.</p> <p><strong> What is Vivendi Universal?</strong><br> It is a global media company formed by the \u00a350bn merger last year of French company Vivendi and Seagram of Canada. Vivendi was formerly known as Compagnie Generale des Eaux - France's biggest water distribution and treatment company. In the 1980s, it diversified into cable TV and had a significant presence in the UK. Vivendi's water division Vivendi Environnement was spun off in July last year. </p> <p><strong>What companies does it contain?</strong><br> Vivendi Universal includes the Universal Studios film studio, the Canal Plus pay-TV channel, the Vizzavi mobile internet service, the Havas advertising company, Universal Music and the Cegetel phone company.</p> <p><strong>What is the key to Vivendi Universal's success?</strong><br> Vizzavi, a joint venture with mobile phone operator Vodafone, has a potential customer base of 80m people. When Vivendi's lucrative content is added to the equation, Vizzavi certainly has exciting prospects.

      "bodyText": "What is Liberty Media Group? It is a US-based cable TV company that also has interests in technology and the internet across Europe, South America and Asia. It is run by John Malone, a highly respected operator, whose no-nonsense-style has earned him the nickname Darth Vader. Who owns Liberty? It is 100%-owned by US telecoms giant AT&amp;T but Mr Malone's board has complete independence and Liberty is expected to be spun off from AT&amp;T in the summer. What does Liberty own? An awful lot. It has 9% of Time Warner, 49% of the Discovery Channels, 25% of UK cable operator Telewest and 21% of TV programming business USA Networks. Most importantly, Liberty holds 20% of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. How did it get involved with NewsCorp? Mr Murdoch recently bought Liberty's stake in interactive TV guide group Gemstar-TV, and let Mr Malone up his holding in NewsCorp. How strong is the Murdoch-Malone link? Mr Murdoch needs strategic allies in the US, which makes 70% of NewsCorp's revenues. But he also needs a friendly buyer for the 22.7% stake in BSkyB, which is being sold by French media giant Vivendi Universal. Mr Malone has the cash - and the ability to execute complicated share swaps - to pull off such a move. How else can Mr Malone help? He could team up with Mr Murdoch to buy DirecTV, the much-coveted satellite TV company owned by General Motors. If Mr Murdoch gets hold of DirecTV, he can float his Sky Global Networks satellite broadcast company. What is Vivendi Universal? It is a global media company formed by the \u00a350bn merger last year of French company Vivendi and Seagram of Canada. Vivendi was formerly known as Compagnie Generale des Eaux - France's biggest water distribution and treatment company. In the 1980s, it diversified into cable TV and had a significant presence in the UK. Vivendi's water division Vivendi Environnement was spun off in July last year. What companies does it contain? Vivendi Universal includes the Universal Studios film studio, the Canal Plus pay-TV channel, the Vizzavi mobile internet service, the Havas advertising company, Universal Music and the Cegetel phone company. What is the key to Vivendi Universal's success? Vizzavi, a joint venture with mobile phone operator Vodafone, has a potential customer base of 80m people. When Vivendi's lucrative content is added to the equation, Vizzavi certainly has exciting prospects. However, will next-generation services such as music and TV via mobile phones really catch on? What are the doubts? A large number of analysts say the merger has reduced shareholder value and doubt if such a wide-ranging group can be knitted together effectively. What are its links with Rupert Murdoch? Vivendi Universal holds a 22.7% stake in BSkyB, which it must sell because of an EU watchdog ruling on the Seagram merger. Jean-Marie Messier, the Vivendi chairman, therefore has a key role to play in the future of Sky Global Networks. What are the options for Mr Messier? He wants to keep Mr Murdoch as an ally, so he is likely to sell the stake to a NewsCorp partner, such as John Malone of Liberty Media. Alternatively, he could swap the stake for a holding in Sky Global Networks, although EU regulators might reach for the rulebook.",

It may not have been travelling at 122kph, but from point-blank range the Frenchman certainly felt it: down for a good few minutes, Angloma spent the rest of the match clearly suffering and blowing rather heavily. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, Angloma seemed to be still struggling when substitute Pedro Munitis produced a rare moment of quality on the left to create the only goal of the game for Real Madrid. Fernando Morientes's header was brilliantly saved by Santiago Ca\u00f1izares, but Ra\u00fal was on hand to finish easily.</p> <p>Valencia's defeat is a huge (probably fatal) blow to their title chances, whereas Madrid have opened up a seven-point lead at the top of the table after Barcelona and Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a disappointed this weekend.</p> <p><strong>Stumbles in the pack</strong></p> <p>La Coru\u00f1a could be forgiven for being distracted by events off the pitch. Last week the Brazilian Djalminha threatened to take the Spanish FA to court for loss of earnings after they suspended him for two games for having a punch-up with his own team-mate, V\u00edctor. With the row rumbling on, Depor manager Javier Irureta wisely decided not to play the Brazilian against Athletic Bilbao on Saturday.</p> <p>But this week Irureta had more problems to deal with, as Canal Plus sneakily recorded, and broadcast, Diego Trist\u00e1n and Fernando slagging off their coach. Fernando quickly rang to beg forgiveness, but there's no news yet from Diego Trist\u00e1n, who arrived in the summer from Mallorca only to find last year's top scorer Roy Makaay blocking his way. </p> <p>Makaay was Depor's hero again, responding to Julen Guerreo's opener with two goals. Irureta didn't celebrate the second strike; instead he turned to the bench with what seemed to be harsh words for the subs (including Trist\u00e1n and Fernando). The Depor coach was even more unhappy when Bilbao secured a draw with a dubious penalty, converted by Aitor Larrazabal, with 20 minutes left.</p> <p>Barcelona also failed to pick up full points, boring their way to a 0-0 draw in M\u00e1laga, where home keeper Pedro Contreras was the star man. Even so, unbeaten in nine league games (15 in total), Bar\u00e7a now look a good bet to finish second or maybe even push Real Madrid to the finish.</p> <p><strong>Toshack gets his first win</strong></p> <p>It's been a weekend of important results at the bottom, too. John Benjamin Toshack is \"happier than I've been for a long time at Real Sociedad\" after his side beat Racing Santander 4-1, Osasuna were the victims as Celta finally won (1-0) to end their dismal run, and Zaragoza were hammered 5-0 by cash-strapped Espanyol, whose manager Paco Flores proved he's up to date with yoof culture, man - \"I get knocked down, but I get up again,\" he sang (ok, said) after the game. Numancia's position is looking increasingly perilous after they were beaten 3-0 at Real Oviedo.</p> <p>This week's big news in the Asturian capital (that's Oviedo, by the way) is that Stanley Collymore is on the way. And while the tabloid hacks and Ray Stubbs reach for their dictionaries to find out what the Spanish is for \"last-chance saloon\", Oviedo boss Radi Antic has been busy waxing lyrical. \"He's a great player and the fans'll love him. It'd be a real luxury for us to be able to call on him,\" he claimed. \"We could be talking about the best signing we've ever made.\" Oviedo fans are hoping he's right.</p> <p>Meanwhile Mart\u00edn Palermo (he of the penchant for missing penalties and wearing drag) still wasn't fit enough to make his league debut for Villarreal, but his new side managed a 1-0 win against Rayo Vallecano, while Valladolid beat Mallorca 2-0 and Alav\u00e9s ended a terrible run of four games without a win by defeating Las Palmas 1-0.</p> <p><strong>Real roll on</strong></p> <p>Finally, with Real Madrid looking likely to win the title for the first time in four years, president Florentino P\u00e9rez is back doing what he does best - winding up Bar\u00e7a fans. And what better way to do that than by telling Canal Plus that \"it feels like Figo's always been at Madrid\". \"He has the leadership, companionship and the fighting spirit of a true Real Madrid player,\" P\u00e9rez gloated, before really laying it on thick: \"Figo was born to be Real Madrid player.\" Born to it? So, his arrival at the Bernab\u00e9u had nothing to do with greed and blatant electioneering, then? </p> <p>It didn't stop there, either. Just in case anyone thought P\u00e9rez was showing an unhealthy interest in matters purely football, he declared Real Madrid to be \"the greatest brand in the world and our bank balance will, no doubt, soon reflect that\". How? Well, here comes the really brilliant part - Real Madrid's training ground is set to be redeveloped, becoming \"a huge theme park - people will travel from all over the world just to see it\". Oh dear, here we go - cue crap jokes about roller-coaster seasons.</p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

John Benjamin Toshack is \"happier than I've been for a long time at Real Sociedad\" after his side beat Racing Santander 4-1, Osasuna were the victims as Celta finally won (1-0) to end their dismal run, and Zaragoza were hammered 5-0 by cash-strapped Espanyol, whose manager Paco Flores proved he's up to date with yoof culture, man - \"I get knocked down, but I get up again,\" he sang (ok, said) after the game. Numancia's position is looking increasingly perilous after they were beaten 3-0 at Real Oviedo. This week's big news in the Asturian capital (that's Oviedo, by the way) is that Stanley Collymore is on the way. And while the tabloid hacks and Ray Stubbs reach for their dictionaries to find out what the Spanish is for \"last-chance saloon\", Oviedo boss Radi Antic has been busy waxing lyrical. \"He's a great player and the fans'll love him. It'd be a real luxury for us to be able to call on him,\" he claimed. \"We could be talking about the best signing we've ever made.\" Oviedo fans are hoping he's right. Meanwhile Mart\u00edn Palermo (he of the penchant for missing penalties and wearing drag) still wasn't fit enough to make his league debut for Villarreal, but his new side managed a 1-0 win against Rayo Vallecano, while Valladolid beat Mallorca 2-0 and Alav\u00e9s ended a terrible run of four games without a win by defeating Las Palmas 1-0. Real roll on Finally, with Real Madrid looking likely to win the title for the first time in four years, president Florentino P\u00e9rez is back doing what he does best - winding up Bar\u00e7a fans. And what better way to do that than by telling Canal Plus that \"it feels like Figo's always been at Madrid\". \"He has the leadership, companionship and the fighting spirit of a true Real Madrid player,\" P\u00e9rez gloated, before really laying it on thick: \"Figo was born to be Real Madrid player.\" Born to it? So, his arrival at the Bernab\u00e9u had nothing to do with greed and blatant electioneering, then? It didn't stop there, either. Just in case anyone thought P\u00e9rez was showing an unhealthy interest in matters purely football, he declared Real Madrid to be \"the greatest brand in the world and our bank balance will, no doubt, soon reflect that\". How? Well, here comes the really brilliant part - Real Madrid's training ground is set to be redeveloped, becoming \"a huge theme park - people will travel from all over the world just to see it\". Oh dear, here we go - cue crap jokes about roller-coaster seasons. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "Police fired tear gas and warning shots as thousands of rock-throwing demonstrators stormed the parliament gates in Jakarta today in the largest protest so far against the president, Abdurrahman Wahid. Three students were badly beaten by police as running battles broke out on the lawns of the heavily guarded legislature. The estimated 10,000 protesters had marched through the streets of the capital, demanding that Mr Wahid quit over two corruption scandals. As the mob broke down the gates, politicians met in a closed session inside the parliament to hear the results of a long-running investigation into the two affairs that have afflicted Mr Wahid's 15-month administration. Speaking to reporters at the presidential palace, Mr Wahid dismissed the significance of the anti-government demonstration and laughed off demands that he should step down. Even so, the size and violence of today's rally was reminiscent of protests that led to the ousting of former dictator Suharto in 1998, and his successor, BJ Habibie, in 1999. Police said around 1,000 supporters of Mr Wahid had also gathered inside the parliamentary compound. However, their support was drowned out by the much larger anti-Wahid demonstration outside. Ijan, one of the students, who like many Indonesians uses one name, said: \"Wahid must resign immediately.\" Mr Wahid has come under increasing pressure as his opponents take heart from events in the neighbouring Philippines where Joseph Estrada was forced to quit as president earlier this month after protests and impeachment proceedings. Analysts warned that today's protest in Jakarta might herald a new wave of violence in Indonesia. Taufik Abdullah, chairman of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, said: \"The demonstrations will continue. The students are looking at the fall of Estrada. This is just the start.\" Last week officials from Mr Wahid's Muslim-based party warned that bloodshed and chaos could erupt if the legislature tried to impeach him. The investigation into the two scandals represents the biggest political challenge to Mr Wahid since he was elected to office in late 1999 after years of authoritarian rule. Lawmakers have not yet publicly released their findings. However, many say there is sufficient evidence to implicate Mr Wahid in both scandals, despite the president's repeated denials of any wrongdoing. It is far from certain, though, whether parliament will pursue the case and initiate lengthy impeachment proceedings. The investigation into Mr Wahid comes as his popularity remains low due to his inability to fix fundamental problems besetting the world's fourth most populous nation. Separatist and sectarian violence has killed thousands in several provinces, and the economy remains in crisis. Authorities also have failed to catch the masterminds of a series of deadly terrorist bombings. The first scandal centres on Mr Wahid's masseur and one-time business partner, who allegedly used the president's name to dupe the government's main food agency, Bulog, into handing over \u00a32.7m from its employees' pension fund. Bulog officials say that months earlier Mr Wahid had asked if the fund's money could be channelled into aid projects in Aceh, a province wracked by bloody separatist fighting. Mr Wahid has admitted he initially considered doing this, but later decided against it. Instead, he accepted \u00a31.3m from the sultan of neighbouring, oil-rich Brunei. His revelation led to allegations of a second scandal, dubbed \"Bruneigate\", despite Mr Wahid's insistence that the sultan's money was a personal donation.

      "bodyText": "The realistic portrayal of violence in TV drama increased significantly in 1999, according to Broadcasting Standards Commission research. 1999 was the year in which EastEnders fell foul of the BSC for the graphic depiction of Steve Owen's murder of scheming Saskia. In total, 692 scenes of fictional violence were recorded in 1999 and 68% were regarded as realistic. This compares with 62% the previous year, according to the BSC. The number of violent scenes also increased markedly in 1999, up to 1,356 from 1,230 the previous year, according to the BSC. Much of this increase was put down to coverage of the Kosovo conflict. News and current affairs accounted for 28% of all depictions of violence on UK terrestrial channels in 1999. The amount of swearing and bad language on terrestrial TV rose significantly in the 1990s, according to the BSC research. In 1999, the BSC recorded 2,887 incidents of offensive language, the highest since the regulator began its tracking survey in 1993. In 1993 there were just over 2,000 incidents of bad language. Sex was another televised activity on the increase. The number of scenes in which sexual acts were portrayed rose from 176 in 1998 to 201 in 1999. But the actual number of programmes containing \"significant\" incidents of sex, violence or bad language remained relatively small, according to the BSC. Only 5% of shows were felt to contain a significant amount of violence and 4% had notable levels of strong language. Only 2.5% featured scenes of explicit sex.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Scott Murray: Sheffield Wednesday to win at Southampton (\u00a35 at 15/2); Tranmere to win at Everton (\u00a35 at 13/2).</strong> </p> <p>Could it be? An actual winner? In January? Whatever next, a left footed Englishman?</p> <p>Yes the marvellous Mr Murray comes to the rescue yet again with the good old value single. I never lost faith in the boy. We all have our little dips in form, our Collymore periods after the honeymoon is over, but class will always tell in the end. Okay so maybe the Collymore metaphor was a mistake but you get the idea.</p> <p>Everton's pitiful form in recent weeks made them very opposable and the fact that they were playing renowned cup team Tranmere in a local derby (which, like the Cup, tends to be a great leveller) just added to the prospect of an upset. But Everton are a Premiership side and Tranmere languish in the lower reaches of the first division so it was obvious Everton would win - one for all accers as we say in the trade (accers being short for accumulators you see, it's a different world I tell you). But regular readers among you will know that avoiding the obvious is the name of the game, the bookies are liable to artificially shorten the 'sure things' in the knowledge that your average betting shop punter will back them at any price and this often leads to value elsewhere. Tranmere at 13/2 looked cracking value, by backing them all you are saying is that if the teams met 15 times Tranmere would win at least twice; obviously Scott was fortunate that this was one of the 'at least two' times, but in the long run luck shouldn't come into it, if you're backing value you will win.

      "bodyText": "Scott Murray: Sheffield Wednesday to win at Southampton (\u00a35 at 15/2); Tranmere to win at Everton (\u00a35 at 13/2). Could it be? An actual winner? In January? Whatever next, a left footed Englishman? Yes the marvellous Mr Murray comes to the rescue yet again with the good old value single. I never lost faith in the boy. We all have our little dips in form, our Collymore periods after the honeymoon is over, but class will always tell in the end. Okay so maybe the Collymore metaphor was a mistake but you get the idea. Everton's pitiful form in recent weeks made them very opposable and the fact that they were playing renowned cup team Tranmere in a local derby (which, like the Cup, tends to be a great leveller) just added to the prospect of an upset. But Everton are a Premiership side and Tranmere languish in the lower reaches of the first division so it was obvious Everton would win - one for all accers as we say in the trade (accers being short for accumulators you see, it's a different world I tell you). But regular readers among you will know that avoiding the obvious is the name of the game, the bookies are liable to artificially shorten the 'sure things' in the knowledge that your average betting shop punter will back them at any price and this often leads to value elsewhere. Tranmere at 13/2 looked cracking value, by backing them all you are saying is that if the teams met 15 times Tranmere would win at least twice; obviously Scott was fortunate that this was one of the 'at least two' times, but in the long run luck shouldn't come into it, if you're backing value you will win. He was less fortunate with his bet on Sheffield Wednesday but that is not to say it wasn't value and that Wednesday wouldn't have won two times out of seventeen. As for his belittling of the wonderful betting medium that is American Football, nobody's perfect I suppose. Perhaps one day he will see the light, meantime he seems to be doing okay on the good old English version. Sean Ingle: Most goals tomorrow selection: \u00a35 on Bristol City @ 3/1 and \u00a32 on Sunderland at 12/1. I certainly reckon these special markets are worth a look (not least because I know the comparatively little time that can go into pricing them up) but given the size of the bookie's margin on such markets they have to get it pretty wrong to offer value. There was not a lot wrong with Mr Ingle's analysis of the market - indeed the three teams he dismissed out of hand all performed badly and the eventual winner Arsenal (a 6/1 shot) received an honourable mention from Mr I without quite making the grade - and as such one has to think that he might have a fair chance on the market in the long run. Unfortunately his actual picks this time round fell somewhat short, five goals to be precise, of the lofty standard set by the Gunners. The secret with esoteric markets such as this is to make them your speciality. In this case, for example, one would follow the market week in week out, gaining a good knowledge of how it worked, producing ratings for teams (both as scorers and conceders of goals, at home and away), and then, for the coup de grace, factor in the specifics of the match (injuries, suspensions, past match-ups and so on) in order to produce one's own prices to compare to those on offer. Unfortunately this is not Mr Ingle's style - a little too much like accountancy, I fear. Oh yeah, and another thing, I notice Mr I only backed his selections to win - with just eight selections the each-way terms of a fifth of the odds if your selection finishes in the first three are actually quite attractive. As it happens had Sean backed both teams each way he would got a fair chunk of his win stake back with one goal being enough, in this case, for a share of third place. Its all part of the learning curve, Rome wasn't built in a day and all that, I still believe Mr I can turn in a profit by the end of the season, but then I also believe that the mighty Reading will get promoted so perhaps I'm best ignored. Joe Fortune of the Football Unlimited Punters Collective: Sunderland v Ipswich - half-time draw, full-time Sunderland \u00a35 @ 4/1 I'm not totally convinced by this bet although I certainly think that draw/favourite is almost invariably better value than the favourite/favourite your average punter tends to back (and your average bookmaker tends to artificially shorten as a consequence). Personally I tend to restrict my forays into the half-time/full-time market to moments when there is a very short priced favourite and draw/favourite can often be backed at extremely attractive odds.

However one must remember the bookie's margin is part of the prices I quoted - the true prices are probably nearer 5/4 if not 11/8 and a 5/4 5/4 double comes in at just over 4/1.

      "body": "<p>For years I have written about the buying and selling of businesses, usually in that detached tone favoured by the financial community.</p> <p>A corporate figure (nearly always a man) is interviewed and boasts about his company and its acquisition. He talks about cutting overheads, making assets sweat - in other words, closing plants and sacking people. Or an analyst speaks knowingly about a business losing its focus on core activities. And I lap it up.</p> <p>Never, until recently, had I been at the other end of such cold reason.</p> <p>Only now can I appreciate what others have gone through as their firms were broken up and sold. Am I better for it? Certainly. Shouldn't all journalists, analysts, accountants, fund managers, consultants and other know-it-alls be exposed to the experience? Absolutely. Would society benefit if the City had more understanding of what it is like to be the subject of unfeeling logic? Financially, no. But it would be a damned sight more compassionate place in which to work.</p> <p>When quoted companies make a big move, they do so in the utmost secrecy. They are obsessed, and rightly so, with fears of the news leaking, of the deal being scuppered, of unscrupulous people making a killing, of the Stock Exchange being the last to know. And this was the case with United News and Media (UNM), owner of Express Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Express and Sunday Express, of which I was deputy editor.</p> <p>Companies that take the stonewall approach fail to realise that senior staff are caught in the middle. You believe or suspect something is up, but don't know for sure. Meanwhile, junior colleagues believe you know what's up and just aren't saying.</p> <p>For the uninformed senior executive, it is dispiriting and demoralising. You feel useless in a sphere where only days before you seemed to exercise total power. Suddenly, you are running an international news operation and are powerless to say for certain what is happening upstairs. The sale of Express Newspapers was on the cards as early as May 1999, but I learned only on November 22 2000 that the papers had been sold.</p> <p>We were not told by UNM. We learnt the news from Sky television. Back in April 1998, I had left the job of deputy editor of the Independent with Rosie Boycott, the editor, to take up the task of turning round the Express titles. We were given a mandate to take the papers upmarket, to make them appeal to a younger, progressive audience. We were promised that the vast resources of UNM, a \u00a35bn corporation, would be at our disposal. There would be massive investment. We'd be able to draw on UNM's television and other media interests.</p> <p>All went well at first. We lost some older readers, wooed in part by promotional overtures from the Daily Mail, but that was predicted. (One commentator forecast we would lose 600,000 readers in six months; in fact, it was 150,000 in almost three years.) UNM, in the person of Lord Hollick, our new chief executive, took a close interest in the papers. Hollick, a big Labour supporter, was a regular at management meetings, where his enthusiasm could be infectious. Marketing plans, expansion and investment proposals were discussed.</p> <p>Then in May 1999 the tap was abruptly turned off. With hindsight, it was the first sign of a shift in strategy that would ultimately lead to a sale. At the time, UNM's parsimony was attributed to the inherent character of Hollick, a shrewd dealmaker who was cautious by nature, not given to the sweeping visionary brushstrokes of media barons such as Rupert Murdoch and Lord Rothermere. </p> <p>Hollick hated to spend money. But, to be fair to him, he had no large personal holding to shore up his position. Unlike Murdoch and Rothermere, Hollick was a salaryman, dependent on the goodwill of his external shareholders. Make them a good return, fine. Screw up and you're out.</p> <p>With us, Hollick was contrary, talking big one minute, lost in petty detail the next. He was enigmatic, fond of playing his cards close to his chest. Once, Boycott and I were summoned to see him about results of research into 'lapsed readers' - who, if we were sticking to our original brief, should not have mattered. We didn't even know the research was being done.</p> <p>Much was made in the press of Boycott's friendship with Hollick, but she never went to his house for dinner and he failed to attend work functions at her home. They would go for long periods without exchanging a word, and when they did it was often over a trivial complaint. Hollick's temper was fearsome; he was used to getting his own way and executives rarely stood up to him.</p> <p>Hollick, however, loved owning newspapers. They gave him political and social cachet. He adored ringing up political and football journalists for the latest gossip. If we had a cabinet minister in for lunch, Hollick expected to be invited. Yet he exhibited little interest or feel for the living organism that a newspaper is - how it is put together, what makes it tick.</p> <p>Hollick's reluctance to spend money did not extend to paying for outside advice. UNM and its many parts were forever being pored over by consultants. It was one such study, I later discovered, that may have prompted the sudden change of policy in May 1999. Unknown to Boycott, PricewaterhouseCoopers had embarked on a crucial study of the Express group. Its sensitivity can be judged by the way it was cloaked in secrecy: in the detailed report that resulted, the project had the code-name Postbox; the Express titles were referred to as Unicorn and their sister publication, the Daily Star, was Comet.</p> <p>The study's conclusion was stark: although progress had been made, further development required investment that might be difficult to justify for a publicly listed company. For Hollick, who prided himself on doing right by shareholders, this was probably not what he wanted to read. The consultants were saying, in effect, that the Express group needed an owner-proprietor, rather than someone who always had to put shareholders' interests first.</p> <p>Rumours of the Express papers being on the block first surfaced in early summer of 1999, and the timing, given the date of the PwC report, cannot have been mere coincidence. Hollick's interest began to wane. The weekly meetings with him in the chair were scrapped, and when we did see him, the conversation dwelt on trivia.</p> <p>After Tony Blair's speech at the Labour party conference in Bournemouth in October 1999, I walked with Hollick to the High Cliff Hotel. He said he was glad for the chance to chat. I thought that at last we might get an indication about future investment. It was not to be. He asked whether I thought he should go to see Barcelona play Arsenal in the Champions League.</p> <p>Industry gossip said Andrew Neil was hovering in the wings, ready to buy on behalf of the Barclay brothers, and Kleinwort Benson, UNM's banker, was preparing sale details. Pieces started appearing in rival newspapers predicting our disposal. One said City analysts were forecasting a \u00a31 rise in UNM's share price if the Express papers were sold. This gave a strong hint of the pressure Hollick faced. UNM shares at that time were barely above \u00a35. Market capitalisation was about \u00a33bn. The rumour mill said the papers would fetch, at most, \u00a3300m - yet here was the City saying we were worth \u00a3600m to the share price.</p> <p>This was always the argument we faced. City analysts, whose work was read by the fund managers who owned the bulk of UNM, thought we were more valuable to the company outside it than within it. One City scribbler even speculated that UNM might be able to raise as much as \u00a31bn by selling us as a provider of content to an internet business, such as Freeserve. UNM had a policy of not commenting on speculative stories. But amid this blizzard of publicity, it meant that assertions went unanswered and claims presented as fact were not denied. It had a curious schizophrenic effect.</p> <p>Internally, UNM assured us there was no truth in the rumours. Externally, the business and media pundits were having a ball. Staff assumed that the editor and deputy were in the loop - that we were somehow in the thick of whatever was happening, that any decision to sell would involve our agreement. Sadly, nothing could have been further from the truth. We were not told; we were not consulted; we did not know.</p> <p>A lull ensued. The rumours died down and we resumed business as normal - except it was anything but normal. While talk of imminent sale had receded for the time being, there was little evidence of any substantial new money for the titles. Both the Daily Express and Sunday Express were battling against an onslaught from the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday. The response from our side was lamentable. All the energy went into producing the paper day to day - it was as if the future did not exist.</p> <p>Journalists are quite unlike other workers. Their trade is information. They are trained observers who like nothing better than gossip. We had 440 pairs of eyes watching us and 440 pairs of ears hanging on every word. Any casual remark, joke or grimace by Boycott was relayed and dissected for any clue to imminent news. We debated whether she should tell staff: 'Look, I hear the rumours, too. But I assure you, I know nothing.' But that was rejected because they would speculate that it was a double bluff.</p> <p>When we interviewed candidates for jobs, they would invariably ask what lay in store for the papers. Staff would come to us and say they had been approached by another paper about a job. What could we advise? All we could answer was that we hadn't a clue. It was undermining - colleagues we knew and liked found it impossible to believe that a national newspaper editor who was so well informed on other matters and was a board director of the Express subsidiary did not know what the parent company was planning. Nor did her deputy.</p> <p>The mood changed again early last year. UNM was proposing to merge with Carlton, whose boss, Michael Green, was said to be looking forward to owning papers and to be keen to expand them. Two firms of consultants were appointed to examine the level of cash injection required to boost circulation. It was not much, but it was something. At least dialogue was taking place. We found ourselves in meetings where the talk was of investment and growth. Suddenly, for a period, there was a sense of belonging, that the papers were to remain part of the UNM-Carlton family.</p> <p>But just as abruptly, the mood changed. Hollick was dealt a savage blow when the Competition Commission ordered UNM to shed its Meridian television holdings as a condition of a merger with Carlton. To Hollick's dismay, Stephen Byers, the trade secretary, accepted the ruling. From what was to be a marriage of equals, the proposed tie-up was hopelessly tilted in Carlton's favour. It was clear the union was off.</p> <p>Speculation again centred on the future of the newspapers. Granada, seen as a possible buyer of UNM, was apparently letting it be known that it did not want Express Newspapers. It was believed that supremos Gerry Robinson and Charles Allen did not want to risk alienating the City by buying the papers, which many viewed as 'old media' - too expensive and too dangerous to take on. They had seen Hollick having to defend the papers to a sceptical City, and that wasn't going to happen to them.</p> <p>When UNM announced the sale of its television division to Granada, the writing was on the wall for the Express group. That's what the City thought, what all the media commentators wrote and what the staff believed. But UNM pretended nothing had changed. Hollick's ambition to become a major media player, with the bulk of ITV and other television interests, plus three national newspapers and several consumer magazines, had come to nought. We at the Express titles now found ourselves part of a company intent on a new direction.</p> <p>What political influence the papers afforded Hollick had vanished. Stories of the Labour peer's rage at the government, which he had loyally supported but which, as he saw it, had not assisted him, made the rounds of the building at Blackfriars. The papers' relationship with their boss had shifted. The feeling grew that he would sell us to any group - especially one opposed to Labour, such as Associated - just to spite the administration that had let him down so badly.</p> <p>There was also the sense that even had he wanted to keep us, Hollick's hands were tied. Weakened by the collapse of the Carlton merger, he had to be seen to be acting decisively to silence his City critics, many of whom had been badgering for the sale of the Express group and now wanted to see positive signs of a decisive strategy for a new-look UNM.</p> <p>At the paper, we explored the possibility of a management buyout and, with Boycott's approval, I met a City heavy-hitter. His reaction to the idea was swift: how would the Daily Express avoid the kind of grief the Independent had suffered when The Times started a price war. With no reserves, the Independent could not respond and its circulation fell. Finally, it had to give up its independence and turned to the Mirror Group for help. The buyout expert explained that the City prefers to back businesses that lead their markets. In other words, it hates taking risks - and, whichever way we cut it, we were a risk. He also said Hollick did not have a reputation for 'leaving something behind on the table' so there was little likelihood that profits could be increased by making cuts - another thing the City likes. It was an eye-opener, one that left me applauding anyone brave enough to get involved in a buyout.</p> <p>Staff assumed, again, that we must have known what was going on. But Boycott had exchanged barely a word with Hollick in the three months before last October's Labour party conference in Brighton, when they had dinner together. I was there, along with other journalists and four government ministers. In the course of a three-hour meal, the subject of the papers never came up. Afterwards, Boycott and I walked with Hollick from the restaurant back to the conference area. He engaged in small talk and we listened. Of the papers, not one word.</p> <p>What we could not have known was that Hollick was sitting on an offer from the Barclay brothers. That fact emerged days later when the Guardian ran a story revealing that Andrew Neil had bid \u00a37m for Express Newspapers. In newspaper parlance, the report was written 'hard', as fact. Clearly, the Guardian had better lines of communication than we did. Express staff were up in arms. They wanted to know what was going on. We had to stand there like lemons and say we did not know. UNM kept a firm silence. Then there was the shock over the \u00a375m price. Surely we were worth more? Yes, but not much more. Earlier in the year, possibly as a way of smoothing the sale of the papers, Hollick had offloaded the building in a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. That deal netted a reported \u00a369m. </p> <p>Even so, Neil's offer seemed absurdly low. The papers made a profit and had a total sales of some 2.5 million. But, mad or not, UNM was saying nothing. The silence said it all: after months of debilitating prevarication and speculation, the papers were finally up for sale. The billionaire Hinduja brothers were interested. So was Mohammed al-Fayed. Another potential buyer was David Montgomery, former head of Mirror Group. There were questions against them all. Just how serious were they? Did they really have the cash? What were their plans for the papers?</p> <p>Officially, UNM was still saying nothing, but news stories began appearing that seemed to carry the imprint of the parent company speaking off the record - in effect, inviting anyone to make a pitch. Internally, we were told zero. Over several weeks, our best sources as to what was going to happen to our business were the Sunday business pages. One week it was the Hinduja brothers, then Associated threw its hat into the ring, then Conrad Black's Hollinger Group. It was a strange feeling, coming into work and wondering whether that unfamiliar limousine parked outside might belong to a new suitor.</p> <p>And still no official word. To add to the confusion, Hollick agreed to expand the circulation team, resurrecting a recruitment drive. It was mind-boggling. If the papers were being sold, why bother? If they weren't, why not say so? At last, at the end of a management meeting, the human resources director said she had been told by UNM to suspend plans for a personnel initiative. The reason, she was informed, was that UNM felt that with all that was going on it was not a priority. This, believe it or not, was the first time UNM had even indicated that anything might be going on.</p> <p>It was just one week before the sale of the papers was announced. As ever, we got our information from the other press. It was a weekly round, finding out what was going on at our own business: the Guardian's media pages came out on Mondays, the Independent's on Tuesdays, the Evening Standard's on Wednesdays, the Telegraph's on Thursdays and The Times' on Fridays. Saturday would usually bring a break before another round from the Sunday business sections. That week's Sunday Times delivered a new name: Richard Desmond, owner-proprietor of the Northern &amp; Shell magazine group.</p> <p>On the Tuesday, two days after the Sunday Times article, I had lunch with Zac Goldsmith, son of the late Sir James and publisher of Ecologist magazine. I toyed with the idea of saying: 'Come on, you can afford us.' I didn't, but no matter - the next day's Financial Times carried a front page story that Desmond was on the point of securing the newspapers. Although other papers had written about us with relish, the FT had rarely weighed in - and this was front-page. It must be sure of the story. That Wednesday will live long in my memory. Another morning of silence from UNM, then at one o'clock Sky proclaimed the sale of Express Newspapers as a breaking story. But still no confirmation.</p> <p>My mobile beeped at 2pm, while I was at the Savoy for the Spectator's Parliamentarian of the Year awards. It was my office: the papers had been sold. Northern &amp; Shell called an afternoon press conference. Boycott was summoned to see Hollick. For the first and only time, he explained to her why the papers had to go - terribly difficult, sorry and all that, hands tied... They said their farewells. Soon afterwards Desmond arrived to say hello.</p> <p> \u0095 This feature is taken from the February edition of Management Today, Britain's leading business magazine.

He also said Hollick did not have a reputation for 'leaving something behind on the table' so there was little likelihood that profits could be increased by making cuts - another thing the City likes. It was an eye-opener, one that left me applauding anyone brave enough to get involved in a buyout. Staff assumed, again, that we must have known what was going on. But Boycott had exchanged barely a word with Hollick in the three months before last October's Labour party conference in Brighton, when they had dinner together. I was there, along with other journalists and four government ministers. In the course of a three-hour meal, the subject of the papers never came up. Afterwards, Boycott and I walked with Hollick from the restaurant back to the conference area. He engaged in small talk and we listened. Of the papers, not one word. What we could not have known was that Hollick was sitting on an offer from the Barclay brothers. That fact emerged days later when the Guardian ran a story revealing that Andrew Neil had bid \u00a37m for Express Newspapers. In newspaper parlance, the report was written 'hard', as fact. Clearly, the Guardian had better lines of communication than we did. Express staff were up in arms. They wanted to know what was going on. We had to stand there like lemons and say we did not know. UNM kept a firm silence. Then there was the shock over the \u00a375m price. Surely we were worth more? Yes, but not much more. Earlier in the year, possibly as a way of smoothing the sale of the papers, Hollick had offloaded the building in a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. That deal netted a reported \u00a369m. Even so, Neil's offer seemed absurdly low. The papers made a profit and had a total sales of some 2.5 million. But, mad or not, UNM was saying nothing. The silence said it all: after months of debilitating prevarication and speculation, the papers were finally up for sale. The billionaire Hinduja brothers were interested. So was Mohammed al-Fayed. Another potential buyer was David Montgomery, former head of Mirror Group. There were questions against them all. Just how serious were they? Did they really have the cash? What were their plans for the papers? Officially, UNM was still saying nothing, but news stories began appearing that seemed to carry the imprint of the parent company speaking off the record - in effect, inviting anyone to make a pitch. Internally, we were told zero. Over several weeks, our best sources as to what was going to happen to our business were the Sunday business pages. One week it was the Hinduja brothers, then Associated threw its hat into the ring, then Conrad Black's Hollinger Group. It was a strange feeling, coming into work and wondering whether that unfamiliar limousine parked outside might belong to a new suitor. And still no official word. To add to the confusion, Hollick agreed to expand the circulation team, resurrecting a recruitment drive. It was mind-boggling. If the papers were being sold, why bother? If they weren't, why not say so? At last, at the end of a management meeting, the human resources director said she had been told by UNM to suspend plans for a personnel initiative. The reason, she was informed, was that UNM felt that with all that was going on it was not a priority. This, believe it or not, was the first time UNM had even indicated that anything might be going on. It was just one week before the sale of the papers was announced. As ever, we got our information from the other press. It was a weekly round, finding out what was going on at our own business: the Guardian's media pages came out on Mondays, the Independent's on Tuesdays, the Evening Standard's on Wednesdays, the Telegraph's on Thursdays and The Times' on Fridays. Saturday would usually bring a break before another round from the Sunday business sections. That week's Sunday Times delivered a new name: Richard Desmond, owner-proprietor of the Northern &amp; Shell magazine group. On the Tuesday, two days after the Sunday Times article, I had lunch with Zac Goldsmith, son of the late Sir James and publisher of Ecologist magazine. I toyed with the idea of saying: 'Come on, you can afford us.' I didn't, but no matter - the next day's Financial Times carried a front page story that Desmond was on the point of securing the newspapers. Although other papers had written about us with relish, the FT had rarely weighed in - and this was front-page. It must be sure of the story. That Wednesday will live long in my memory. Another morning of silence from UNM, then at one o'clock Sky proclaimed the sale of Express Newspapers as a breaking story. But still no confirmation. My mobile beeped at 2pm, while I was at the Savoy for the Spectator's Parliamentarian of the Year awards. It was my office: the papers had been sold. Northern &amp; Shell called an afternoon press conference. Boycott was summoned to see Hollick. For the first and only time, he explained to her why the papers had to go - terribly difficult, sorry and all that, hands tied... They said their farewells. Soon afterwards Desmond arrived to say hello. \u0095 This feature is taken from the February edition of Management Today, Britain's leading business magazine.

      "byline": "Alan Travis",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Jack Straw calls his official penal policy \"making prisons work\", and after a decade in which an almost obsessive concern with security has dominated most aspects of jail life, the past two years have at last started to see real improvements in Britain's prisons. Significant money has started to flow from the treasury to fund the biggest ever literacy and numeracy drive for inmates; more than 50 prisons now run drug treatment courses; and new programmes introduced to tackle the criminal behaviour of inmates claim to have cut the reconviction rate by one-third.</p> <p>The director-general of the prison service, Martin Narey, has also presided over the first real attempt to root out corruption and brutality. According to the latest count, some 99 prison officers are currently suspended pending investigations. Racism is finally on the agenda. Perhaps even more importantly, after the stormy battles between Michael Howard and his prisons chief, Derek Lewis, the service has been enjoying a period of stability, first under Richard Tilt and now under Narey.</p> <p>As ever, there is no shortage of critics of the system. Frances Crook, director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, concedes that Straw's watch has seen an improvement but is still disappointed. \"There are too many people in the system for a start. And nobody knows what it's for. It's not achieving public safety, or crime reduction. What the prison service is doing at the moment is making crime worse, creating more victims and costing the taxpayer an awful lot of money.\"</p> <p>Douglas Hurd, the former Conservative home secretary, also thinks things have improved since Lord Woolf's agenda-setting inquiry into prisons a decade ago. Slopping out has virtually disappeared and conditions inside new prisons, whether private or state-run, are better, but overcrowding and the survival of a retrograde culture dominated by the Prison Officers' Association still blight many regimes.</p> <p>For Hurd, the chairman of the Prison Reform Trust, part of the problem lies in the fact that the political culture fails to take a real interest in prisons. No serving prime minister, Tony Blair included, has ever visited a prison, and Hurd believes that if inmates were given the vote then MPs would be forced to take a more active interest in their local prisons.</p> <p>The prison population today stands at 62,784, slightly down on a year ago. It is still the second highest in Europe, but Straw has capped it with the introduction of his home-detention curfew scheme. Last week some 1,633 prisoners were serving the last weeks of their sentences at home with an electronic tag. Despite Ann Widdecombe's attacks on the scheme, it has so far proved effective, with 96% successfully completing their sentences. If anything it is too cautious, and thousands more minor offenders could be let out with a tag without putting the public at risk.</p> <p>But this progress has come at a price. The expansion in literacy and numeracy classes has been bought at the expense of a wider educational programme. \"Art and sculpture classes don't help people into jobs,\" Narey has said. And overcrowding - 36 jails have more than 100 inmates \"doubled up\" in single cells - is still a barrier to any serious progress.</p> <p>The Woolf report clearly identified overcrowding as a cause of unrest. Then, more than 9,000 prisoners were sharing single cells. Now, according to official figures, there is sufficient accommodation for all but 500 prisoners. Hurd believes that, while the pressure is not as great as when he was home secretary, it is still a corrosive problem. \"There are a number of prisons, like Preston, which are more than 50% overcrowded, and there are lots of others where there is room, so the total figure does not convey the real pressures. The chances of getting education are less because the demands on the staff just to run the place take priority over everything else.\"</p> <p>The state of young offenders' institutions, particularly Feltham, is still a scandal, so much so that Lord Woolf declared that he could not recommend sending the two Bulger killers to one. The rapid rise in the number of women prisoners, and the continuing high rate of suicides, continue to pose their own problems.</p> <p>The obsession with security, triggered by the mid-1990s breakouts from Whitemoor and Parkhurst, has ensured that there have been no more category A escapes. But one recent casualty of this policy was Blantyre House, which had been the most successful resettlement prison in the system. MPs severely criticised the midnight raid on the jail as a completely unjustified \"self-inflicted wound\".</p> <p>The battle over the introduction of private prisons is over.

      "bodyText": "Jack Straw calls his official penal policy \"making prisons work\", and after a decade in which an almost obsessive concern with security has dominated most aspects of jail life, the past two years have at last started to see real improvements in Britain's prisons. Significant money has started to flow from the treasury to fund the biggest ever literacy and numeracy drive for inmates; more than 50 prisons now run drug treatment courses; and new programmes introduced to tackle the criminal behaviour of inmates claim to have cut the reconviction rate by one-third. The director-general of the prison service, Martin Narey, has also presided over the first real attempt to root out corruption and brutality. According to the latest count, some 99 prison officers are currently suspended pending investigations. Racism is finally on the agenda. Perhaps even more importantly, after the stormy battles between Michael Howard and his prisons chief, Derek Lewis, the service has been enjoying a period of stability, first under Richard Tilt and now under Narey. As ever, there is no shortage of critics of the system. Frances Crook, director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, concedes that Straw's watch has seen an improvement but is still disappointed. \"There are too many people in the system for a start. And nobody knows what it's for. It's not achieving public safety, or crime reduction. What the prison service is doing at the moment is making crime worse, creating more victims and costing the taxpayer an awful lot of money.\" Douglas Hurd, the former Conservative home secretary, also thinks things have improved since Lord Woolf's agenda-setting inquiry into prisons a decade ago. Slopping out has virtually disappeared and conditions inside new prisons, whether private or state-run, are better, but overcrowding and the survival of a retrograde culture dominated by the Prison Officers' Association still blight many regimes. For Hurd, the chairman of the Prison Reform Trust, part of the problem lies in the fact that the political culture fails to take a real interest in prisons. No serving prime minister, Tony Blair included, has ever visited a prison, and Hurd believes that if inmates were given the vote then MPs would be forced to take a more active interest in their local prisons. The prison population today stands at 62,784, slightly down on a year ago. It is still the second highest in Europe, but Straw has capped it with the introduction of his home-detention curfew scheme. Last week some 1,633 prisoners were serving the last weeks of their sentences at home with an electronic tag. Despite Ann Widdecombe's attacks on the scheme, it has so far proved effective, with 96% successfully completing their sentences. If anything it is too cautious, and thousands more minor offenders could be let out with a tag without putting the public at risk. But this progress has come at a price. The expansion in literacy and numeracy classes has been bought at the expense of a wider educational programme. \"Art and sculpture classes don't help people into jobs,\" Narey has said. And overcrowding - 36 jails have more than 100 inmates \"doubled up\" in single cells - is still a barrier to any serious progress. The Woolf report clearly identified overcrowding as a cause of unrest. Then, more than 9,000 prisoners were sharing single cells. Now, according to official figures, there is sufficient accommodation for all but 500 prisoners. Hurd believes that, while the pressure is not as great as when he was home secretary, it is still a corrosive problem. \"There are a number of prisons, like Preston, which are more than 50% overcrowded, and there are lots of others where there is room, so the total figure does not convey the real pressures. The chances of getting education are less because the demands on the staff just to run the place take priority over everything else.\" The state of young offenders' institutions, particularly Feltham, is still a scandal, so much so that Lord Woolf declared that he could not recommend sending the two Bulger killers to one. The rapid rise in the number of women prisoners, and the continuing high rate of suicides, continue to pose their own problems. The obsession with security, triggered by the mid-1990s breakouts from Whitemoor and Parkhurst, has ensured that there have been no more category A escapes. But one recent casualty of this policy was Blantyre House, which had been the most successful resettlement prison in the system. MPs severely criticised the midnight raid on the jail as a completely unjustified \"self-inflicted wound\". The battle over the introduction of private prisons is over. The judgment passed by Sir David Ramsbotham, the chief inspector of prisons, is that the nine private jails have, by and large, delivered a higher standard of treatment for prisoners than the public sector. Even so, the pendulum is beginning to swing back to state-run jails. Now the threat of privatisation is being used to drive up standards in \"failing\" prisons, such as Brixton, but the private prison companies are not keen to get involved. What state are our prisons in? The verdict at present would seem to be: not good, but getting better. The biggest problem, says Hurd, is that no one in either major party is willing to argue for alternatives to custody that would clear the prisons of thousands of inmates. He faults Jack Straw, in particular, for failing to do enough to explain that other punishments are possible: \"He is afraid of being accused of being soft. It needs a clear explanation of why we need to go down this path.

I was in solitary for 14 months before being transferred to an experimental prison. The ground rules were trust and responsibility with freedom. The idea was to use art therapy to get people to express themselves without violence. I was there about seven years, and it worked in that I was more aware of where the violence was coming from. The idea of the special unit was to bring you into contact with as many visitors as possible, and I began to see how fucked up I was. </p> <p>After a while I went back to a traditional system and found it almost impossible. I was continually provoked by officers. Once they put me in a hall that was 99% sex offenders and I was told that if I refused to communicate with them I would never get parole. And if I got into a fight it was always my fault and they would add to my sentence. For about five years I was put in these almost impossible situations. </p> <p>Even though I could feel that the special unit had helped me, I could not say it. I had quite a reputation in prison and if you tell any of your fellow inmates you've changed, they see it as a weakness. </p> <p>I took heroin right through my sentence. I hated being on drugs. During the day I could look at it logically but at night I couldn't cope with the fact that I'd killed a person. The staff knew I was on drugs but were frightened of me, and knew they were safe when I was on heroin. So I left prison with quite a serious drug addiction. </p> <p>Coming out was a nightmare. I was just lucky I met Caroline, my wife. She helped me change the way I was. I've published two autobiographies and fiction, but without that I would have been totally lost. </p> <p>Michael Howard, with that nonsense about \"prison works\" - the damage he has done is unbelievable. The longer your sentence, the worse state you're in when you come out. I don't think there should be a time limit on a life sentence. It should be when a guy is rehabilitated. But society has got to be ready to take these people on board.</p> <p><b>James Francis, 52</b><br> Sentence: 12 years<br> Crime: conspiracy to import cannabis</p> <p> I was detained for a long time in Walton jail, Liverpool. I lived in what they call a \"drug-free\" wing. Extra funding goes with that kind of status, which in real terms demands that 93% of piss tests show up negative. If that percentage were to vary too much, then funding would be threatened and so they maintain the numbers the easy way. Instead of looking for prisoners who wish to live in a drug-free environment, they open their doors to everyone. And all manner of piss-test beating scams go on. That way everybody's happy: the junkies carry on as normal, the prisons get their funding, the Home Office can pretend they're doing something useful, and the public get their numbers. </p> <p>My first cellmate, Tony, was a user. Before he came to prison he'd only tried cannabis, but prison had changed that. I remember him telling me that pot stays in the system too long for the mandatory drugs test \"and anyway, smack's cheaper in here\". One night, to gain admission into the prison hospital and a chance of sedation, he scratched at his wrists with a dismantled safety razor and rang the alarm bell. He was taken away by officers who derided his pathetic efforts. I never saw him again, but heard he later hung himself in HMP Altcourse. </p> <p>In a way prison has been a salutary lesson. It has tested the loyalty of my friends and shown me a side of life few get to witness. I'll never smuggle again, but there's no hope of coming out a better person. </p> <p>Most of my experiences haven't underscored my remorse, just my anger. Experiences so negative can only have negative effects, and I will never escape the anger of oppression. I was dehumanised in those terrible places, and for the rest of my life, no matter what lies ahead, I will feel tainted. I accept that prisons are necessary and a prison officer's job can be difficult at times; I appreciate their need to establish authority to function effectively. What is patently wrong, though, is the way the prison service old-guard are allowed to corrupt and seduce the incoming recruits with their sadistic ways. </p> <p>From my experiences I see prison as a place where drug barons exchange contacts alongside burglars who are constantly improving their modus operandi; a place where paedophiles extend their networks, and a place where a young pot-smoker can learn to chase the dragon and then hang himself by the neck until dead.</p>",

And if I got into a fight it was always my fault and they would add to my sentence. For about five years I was put in these almost impossible situations. Even though I could feel that the special unit had helped me, I could not say it. I had quite a reputation in prison and if you tell any of your fellow inmates you've changed, they see it as a weakness. I took heroin right through my sentence. I hated being on drugs. During the day I could look at it logically but at night I couldn't cope with the fact that I'd killed a person. The staff knew I was on drugs but were frightened of me, and knew they were safe when I was on heroin. So I left prison with quite a serious drug addiction. Coming out was a nightmare. I was just lucky I met Caroline, my wife. She helped me change the way I was. I've published two autobiographies and fiction, but without that I would have been totally lost. Michael Howard, with that nonsense about \"prison works\" - the damage he has done is unbelievable. The longer your sentence, the worse state you're in when you come out. I don't think there should be a time limit on a life sentence. It should be when a guy is rehabilitated. But society has got to be ready to take these people on board. James Francis, 52 Sentence: 12 years Crime: conspiracy to import cannabis I was detained for a long time in Walton jail, Liverpool. I lived in what they call a \"drug-free\" wing. Extra funding goes with that kind of status, which in real terms demands that 93% of piss tests show up negative. If that percentage were to vary too much, then funding would be threatened and so they maintain the numbers the easy way. Instead of looking for prisoners who wish to live in a drug-free environment, they open their doors to everyone. And all manner of piss-test beating scams go on. That way everybody's happy: the junkies carry on as normal, the prisons get their funding, the Home Office can pretend they're doing something useful, and the public get their numbers. My first cellmate, Tony, was a user. Before he came to prison he'd only tried cannabis, but prison had changed that. I remember him telling me that pot stays in the system too long for the mandatory drugs test \"and anyway, smack's cheaper in here\". One night, to gain admission into the prison hospital and a chance of sedation, he scratched at his wrists with a dismantled safety razor and rang the alarm bell. He was taken away by officers who derided his pathetic efforts. I never saw him again, but heard he later hung himself in HMP Altcourse. In a way prison has been a salutary lesson. It has tested the loyalty of my friends and shown me a side of life few get to witness. I'll never smuggle again, but there's no hope of coming out a better person. Most of my experiences haven't underscored my remorse, just my anger. Experiences so negative can only have negative effects, and I will never escape the anger of oppression. I was dehumanised in those terrible places, and for the rest of my life, no matter what lies ahead, I will feel tainted. I accept that prisons are necessary and a prison officer's job can be difficult at times; I appreciate their need to establish authority to function effectively. What is patently wrong, though, is the way the prison service old-guard are allowed to corrupt and seduce the incoming recruits with their sadistic ways. From my experiences I see prison as a place where drug barons exchange contacts alongside burglars who are constantly improving their modus operandi; a place where paedophiles extend their networks, and a place where a young pot-smoker can learn to chase the dragon and then hang himself by the neck until dead.",

      "body": "<p>It could, perhaps, happen to many or any of us: a misunderstanding at the Safeway checkout; the discovery of your stash of dope; a punch-up at closing time; a moment of insanity while driving . . . If the worst comes to the worst, and you are jailed in Bedfordshire or Cambridgeshire, you end up right here: being led in handcuffs up a flight of echoing stone steps by a Group Four employee, to be greeted by a gruff, burly figure like senior officer Rick Barnsdale, of the reception department of Her Majesty's Prison, Bedford.</p> <p>There is a brisk exchange of information while he fills in the first of the countless official forms. You hand over your property to be bagged and tagged: some of it will come back within the hour; some won't. Banned are alcohol-based toiletries (which might get drunk); wind-up radios (bomb-making potential); protein powders (mixable with drugs); bracelets (possible knuckledusters); football shirts (which might provoke a fight); and bananas (the mind boggles, but apparently you can smoke the skins).</p> <p>Then you get photographed and strip-searched, without ever being entirely naked: if you have heroin or (they swear it has happened) a knife hidden up your rectum, they won't find it unless it falls out when they tell you to squat. You are examined by a nurse and a doctor. If you are on remand, you can have your clothes back, the football shirt excepted. If you are convicted, you get the prison uniform: blue-striped shirt, grey sweatshirt, maroon jumper and jeans - perhaps not dissimilar to the clothes you were wearing in the first place. Then, past one further instruction - TUCK YOUR SHIRT IN - you are led to a cell. It is like checking in to a very, very bad hotel.</p> <p>If Barnsdale and his colleagues seem edgy, it is partly because they have no idea what to expect. Some prisoners arrive fighting mad; others are tearful. Most, however, are compliant - they do know what to expect. There is a theory that prisons ought to make the reception procedure twice as nasty, then open the door and boot first-timers out on the street. That way they might never come back. Bedford has more regulars than the best hotels.</p> <p>There is no such thing as a typical British jail. They all have their foibles, and connoisseurs - both volunteers and conscripts - can discuss the differences with relish. But Bedford will do as an example. It is small: 400 inmates (all male) and 150 officers. It is a local prison: Category B, which means all but the worst villains start here, though most will be transferred onwards.</p> <p>It provides an authentic prison experience, too. The new jails often feel like comprehensive schools with very high windows. This one was opened in 1801 (the bicentenary ball is in August - residents not invited) by the penal reformer John Howard. It was state-of-the-art then; it certainly isn't now. The 12 by 9ft double cells date back to the 1840s, changed only for the addition of electricity and a not-very-private en suite toilet and basin, when slopping out was abolished a few years back. If it is ever closed down, Bedford could be used as a film set - from the 20ft outside wall to the Alcatraz-style exercise yard. The \"topping-shed\" where James Hanratty was hanged 40 years ago has been demolished, and the death cell is now a canteen. Almost everything else has been preserved, if not lovingly.</p> <p>But this jail may last another 100 years, even though it's on prime land in the town centre. A trust owns the site, so it cannot be sold off. And, though once it was considered to be the most overcrowded jail in western Europe, Bedford is now well regarded. The chief inspector, Sir David Ramsbotham, was complimentary when he came to visit in 1998. The Board of Visitors, who inspect regularly, feel the same: \"This is a very well run jail,\" says Peter Baldwin, its chairman.</p> <p>Bedford's glory, if that is the word, is its staff-prisoner relations. Like most greenhorns, I stepped over the threshold imagining that being buggered or bashed would be an absolute certainty. After a few days talking to dozens of people - jailers and jailed - this seemed far less likely. Indeed, I came to feel, like Jonathan Aitken, that prison could hold few terrors for anyone who endured a British public school in the 50s or 60s. At least fagging and beatings are officially barred.</p> <p>Most of the screws I met were - in theory, anyway - thoughtful and caring. They didn't tuck the prisoners up and kiss them goodnight, but they were not heavy-handed. There are a surprising number of women officers, many of them pretty: \"a humanising influence\" is the consensus. The food (three choices at supper plus vegetarian option; ethnic night every Wednesday) seemed better than in the average school or hospital. And for smokers - which here means almost everyone - prison is about the most liberal place left in Britain: far more tolerant than the Guardian office.</p> <p>It helps that there is a high turnover of inmates in Bedford: potential barons have less chance to get established, and officialdom has more of a chance to maintain the upper hand. The endless battle to keep out drugs is a stand-off, with the advantage - at least on cannabis - perhaps just shifting towards authority, thanks to mandatory testing. We hear about prisons when good order breaks down but, mostly, order does not break down. A prison runs properly only with the inmates' consent. \"On a Saturday afternoon there will be 95 prisoners at exercise and only four prison officers,\" says Peter Clarke, the deputy governor. \"If they didn't want to go back, we couldn't make them.\"</p> <p>\"Of all the TV programmes I've ever seen on prisons,\" says Barnsdale, \"there's only one that's ever been remotely true to life.\" He pauses for effect. \"Porridge. The public perception is one of violence. But it's mostly a good-humoured place to work.\"</p> <p>None the less, this is a place containing hundreds of frustrated individuals, jammed together and moaning constantly. And that's just the warders. They have a vital, responsible and - humour or not - sometimes dangerous job. They are paid badly and public sympathy is zero. \"It's the same every Christmas,\" says one officer. \"They'll say on TV about all the poor policemen and nurses who have to work. No one ever mentions us.\" Prison officers are said to have the highest sickness rate in the country, and Bedford is not immune.</p> <p>Indeed, the good humour has been in short supply lately. A new, young governor, Andrew Cross, arrived in October and uncovered a financial crisis he is fighting to put right. \"When we compete with the private sector,\" Cross says to me at one point, \"we give a high level of service delivery for minimum cost.\" He might have been in charge of the borough refuse collection. As one of his aides puts it: \"Management, efficiency and budgets figure far more in the equation now than prisoners. They're treated as a compliant commodity.\"</p> <p>So far, Bedford has not had to compete with the private sector. Hence the crisis, in the Cross view. \"I actually embrace the opportunity to deliver better value for money for the taxpayers,\" he says. \"I have no qualms about that. If you look where staff are deployed, we can offer big savings. We all know there is going to be a fire in a street in the course of a year, but you can't have a fire engine on every street corner the whole year round. This job is all about risk assessment.\"</p> <p>His staff say they have been enduring cutbacks for years, and that the risks are too great. \"Our primary role is to keep prisoners here,\" says one officer. \"And a lot of time is spent standing round watching them watching us watching them. If that means standing round in a big circle holding hands, so be it. You've got the threat of physical violence 24-7.\"</p> <p>At least the prisoners get fed. The staff mess has been closed as a loss-maker, so officers have to cross the furiously busy A428 (Bedford's equivalent of the shark-infested waters round Devil's Island) to get lunch. Some go and have a few pints, which angers the governor.</p> <p>However, the prisoners are no more content. \"I'm not boasting,\" says one of the kitchen workers, \"but I've been in seven different jails. This one's shit. It's pure bang-up.\" Translation: Bedford prisoners spend a lot of time in their cells.</p> <p>This is partly true. The transit-camp aspect of the place means not everyone has a job, and the unemployed get locked up a lot. The authorities insist that everyone can find something to do. Some of the stuff is actually imaginative. Even the prisoners praise the Enhanced Thinking Skills course, in which they are forced to consider the consequences of each action. And there is a charity workshop that produces chess pieces (exquisite) and wedges, which Bedfordshire Crime Prevention give old ladies to stop their doors being forced open (exquisitely ironic).</p> <p>But it takes time to find a niche in jail. For the newcomer (after that mishap at Safeway or whatever), it is those first few hours that are so terrifying, as you come to terms with the uncertainties of prison - and the certainties. Lock-up is at eight. For the next 11 and a half hours there is no way out of the cell. The blocks slowly get quieter: the radios and (for the privileged) the TVs get turned down; the jangle of keys gets more infrequent. Then, perhaps, true desperation sets in.</p> <p>Come the dawn, things get better. There is an induction course where an officer like Bill McCready - small, stocky, northern, ex-RAF - takes the previous day's intake through the rules. There is an accompanying booklet, which is fine for the literate. So there is also an airline-style video, in which a soothing female voice talks about the \"well stocked canteen\" as if advertising the in-flight duty frees. McCready himself is not soothing - \"If you expect everything to be done at once, you've come too far over the bridge. It's the Moat House you were looking for\" - but not unkind. The probation officer - who will at least call you Mr - the doctor, the chaplain and the education officer, may be truly kind. Then you can make a telephone call. And Day Two will pass, slowly. From what I saw, no single minute need be obscenely awful in Bedford. It's the hours, days, weeks, months and years.</p> <p>Does any of this work? Of course not. The most regular visitor I met was a poor inadequate on his 21st sentence. His only hope would be a place in some kind of halfway house. No one can find him one: he knows he'll be back. So will many, maybe most, of the others. About 70% of their crimes are in some way drug-related. Until that is addressed, there is little hope.</p> <p>Yet there was one promising sign. It struck me when I watched C Wing queue up for supper (shepherd's pie; chicken and mushroom pie; vegetable hotpot or rather manky kipper fillets). Most of the inmates would not have looked that out of place queuing at the refectory of an Oxford college. There was hardly anyone over 30.</p> <p>Some - the serious drinkers and druggies - never make 30. But most, it seems, actually do get smarter. \"It's the wives and girlfriends who do it,\" one officer theorised. \"They get fed up and start issuing ultimatums.\" And that seems to work far better than all the Home Office penal policies put together.</p> <p>Harshness for its own sake is out of fashion under Labour. But liberalism is hardly the watchword either. \"We have to treat prisoners well, and we do at Bedford,\" says Cross. \"That's our saving grace. But it's not enough. We have to treat them well, and do it cheaply.\"</p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,430315,00.html&quot;\">Cut jail population to minimum, Blair told</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,430153,00.html\">Does prison work?</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,430155,00.html\">Inside knowledge</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,430154,00.html\">Prisons: the best and worst</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,430156,00.html\">Room to improve</a><br></p>",

      "body": "<p>I can still vividly remember his dark, pinstripe suit, so skilfully tailored that it retained its immaculate shape even when he sat down, and his lightly tanned, manicured hands emerging from stiff white cuffs. It was the summer of 1990 and Lord Justice Woolf, as he was then, had come to visit the high-security Midlands prison where I was being held as part of his inquiry into the Strangeways riot and other prison disturbances.</p> <p>At that time the prison was well known in the system for holding mainly \"hardcore\" offenders. Long sentences and cramped accommodation made for a tense atmosphere. Wing life could be precarious, with a stabbing or a scalding almost every other day. \"Paranoia City\", the inmates called it. Lord Woolf had already spoken to the governors and the prison officers, and now he wanted to talk to the prisoners.</p> <p>There were about 30 of us present that morning, serving sentences ranging from five to 35 years. We sat on soft-backed chairs, set in three semi-circle rows in the prison chapel. After some polite small talk, Woolf explained why he was there: \"We need to try and find out what it is actually like to be in prison.\" Until that moment, this was not something I had spent much time thinking about. What was it like to be in prison? Didn't he know? Of course he didn't - how could he? But for the first time since beginning my sentence six years earlier, I contemplated the fact that the people responsible for sending us to prison had no idea what it was like. Perhaps that was the problem.</p> <p>Around me, men I had never before heard discussing their feelings about prison were doing their best to fill in the blanks. It was \"educational\", one said. \"In what way?\" the judge wanted to know. \"Well, you learn to understand yourself better,\" came the reply. \"You spend so much time in your head.\" Others talked about the loneliness, the fear, the paranoia.</p> <p>I sat there and drifted back to my first day as a prisoner. I'm walking along a gantry-style landing on the long-term wing of a large London prison. I'm on the third floor - \"the threes\". I'm carrying a plastic bucket inside which clatters a plastic cup, knife, fork and spoon. Under my arm I have a \"bedroll\": two flannel sheets rolled up inside two coarse blankets.</p> <p>I'm guided to my cell by a large prison officer sporting a handlebar moustache. The peak of his cap has been \"slashed\" so it fits low over the bridge of his nose. We reach the cell and with a noisy rattle of his keys he unlocks the door and pushes it open. He's smiling \"In you go son, don't be shy.\" The door slams shut behind me.</p> <p>The cell is dimly lit by a small, grime-covered fluorescent light. The walls are covered in cracked and flaking emulsion. There's a table, a chair, and a metal bed, with a stained mattress and half a foam pillow. The heavily barred window high up on the wall is closed, and the urine-tainted air makes me want to retch.</p> <p>I sit down on the bed. Time to collect my thoughts - but no, I hear a sound like rolling thunder approaching fast, and suddenly the cell door is unlocked and pushed open again. \"Slop out and get your tea,\" instructs handlebars.</p> <p>A stream of denim-clad men in identi cal blue-and-white-striped shirts are shuffling past my door. I step out and join the flux. Down two flights of metal stairs to the ground floor; we're headed towards a set of trestle tables. A row of prisoners in white are serving food. Before I get there I am stopped in my tracks by a scream: \"He's fuckin' dead meat!\" \"Nonce! He's fuckin' dead meat!\" I turn and see two men: one wields a mop handle, the other a metal bucket. They are using the domestic implements to beat a third prisoner who cowers in a cell doorway. \"He's fuckin' dead meat!\"</p> <p>Suddenly I'm aware that no one else is stopping. Nobody is intervening. Few even look in the direction of the violence. I fall back in line, pick up a tray, collect my meal and return to my cell. As I sit on the chair and spoon down the food, all thoughts and feelings about why I am in prison are relegated. My first priority, I now understand, is to learn to survive.</p> <p>Back in the chapel, a prisoner was telling the judge that life inside was \"a war of survival\". I recognised the angry voice instantly: it was John, who lives on my spur. The same John who a few months earlier had led an attempt to burn a number of sex offenders. John's accomplice had been transferred out of the prison following the riot but he had remained, his status with other prisoners enhanced. I half wished that somebody would explain this to the judge, and say: \"Your honour, that's what prison is like.\"</p> <p>The judge's visit set me thinking. Prison was no doubt necessary. But it was unsettling that prison life was such a mystery to society. There seemed an assumption among many on the outside that people in prison were inherently different. Prisoners were not individuals, but a collective, with the same crude standards, values, and culture - a sub-race, almost.</p> <p>It made me think about some of the people I had met inside. There was Dave, who on the out had been a postman; Howard, who had been a student; and Tam who had been a council worker. The four of us played pool at the weekend. Tam was the captain of the wing football team, nicknamed \"the Commander\" for his prowess in midfield. Dave had asthma so he'd taken up jogging. He'd lost two stone, bolstered his health and begun doing sponsored runs around the football pitch for charity. Howard spent his days in the education department studying and dreaming of becoming a teacher.</p> <p>Three and a half years later, my next movement order came through. By then Tam had been transferred to Scotland. Dave was in a semi-open prison, let out regularly to take part in charity road runs. And Howard was dead - diabetes-induced coma. One night in bed he went to sleep with his face in the pillow and never woke up.</p> <p>Prison life is mostly a continuous repetition of the same day, over and over again. Finding a purpose and a meaning beyond \"punishment\" can be a struggle. Often people are not in prison long enough to discover anything worthwhile beyond a new set of criminal alliances. Or people end up inside for so long that any good that might have been achieved along the way is undermined by bitterness and resentment.</p> <p>The paradox of imprisonment lies in society's expectations: the community wants retribution, but also rehabilitation. For many, sending people to prison is not enough; they must suffer while there. But only somebody who has never been to prison would believe that jails are \"soft\" places.</p> <p>I remember the campaign a few years ago calling for prisons to be made more \"austere\". But the truth that the austerity brigade failed to grasp is that the harsher a prisoner feels himself to have been treated, the less of an obligation he will feel to abide by society's rules, and the more likely new victims will be created after release. Official figures speak for themselves - more than half of prisoners reoffend within two years of release.</p> <p>I have seen it with my own eyes: a young man serving four years, and not prepared to kowtow to what he sees as the intransigence of the prison regime. Why can't he go out on the exercise yard when it's raining? Why has his mother not been allowed to visit him just because she brought the wrong visiting order by mistake? He gets known as a \"troublemaker\", goes \"on report\", and loses his \"time off for good behaviour\". Less than two years after he is freed, he is back, serving a minimum 25-year sentence. Any connection?</p> <p>A fair answer to Lord Woolf's question would not be entirely bleak. Opportunities for personal advancement abound in prison. I have never been in a jail which did not have an education department, library, gymnasium, chapel, psychologists, probation officers and counsellors. I have been a beneficiary of all the above. When I sat on that bed in that London prison 17 years ago, I never dreamed how my life would be transformed. I could barely string two sentences together; now I sit here with an embarrassment of qualifications, which include Braille transcription, sports leadership, a clutch of O levels and an arts degree.</p> <p>There are many fine people who work in prisons. I recall the cookery teacher who made sure everyone in her class got to make a Christmas cake to send home to their families, even when they couldn't afford the ingredients. The teacher who taught his play-reading group to love Shakespeare. The young prison officer who treated prisoners with such respect that, when he died suddenly, dozens in their best striped shirts lined the route from the gate to the prison to bow their heads to his hearse. And the governor who had the courage to tell a man convicted of brutal crimes that, in his view, considering the man's background, he was as much a victim as his victims. But the fact remains that I've never been in a jail where making prisoners feel good about themselves was a priority.</p> <p>Many prisoners were sceptical about private prisons at first. The morality of making profit from imprisonment seemed questionable at best. But the message began to spread that they were preferable to state-run prisons. A conversation with a prison auxiliary helped me understand why. He had transferred prisoners to a private prison. \"You should see the difference,\" he said. \"As soon as the cons get out of the van, they're greeted with a 'Good morning, Mr Smith, would you like to come this way?' They're reminded that they're people first and prisoners second. Their whole demeanour changes. They're polite in return to the staff, and each other!\" I had to admit I had never been to a prison like that.</p> <p>Prison is designed to disempower. Everyone in jail is vulnerable to a greater or lesser extent. Prisoners live at the mercy of those who are in charge, and of each other, and dignity is a scarce commodity. If the regime is accompanied by an attitude that undermines a prisoner's confidence and self-esteem, then all the stated good intentions will be worth nothing. It is when prisoners feel that they are not being afforded respect as people that the cynical prison culture - the culture of John and the nonce beaters - thrives.</p> <p>During the course of his inquiry, Lord Woolf visited 43 prisoners. When his 600-page report was published, optimism surged through the system. That was until it was all but mothballed by the \"prison works\" philosophy of the mid-90s. More people in prison, the theory went, meant less criminals on the streets, so less crimes being committed.</p> <p>Before this idea took off, the chaplain in a jail I was in told me: \"Mark my words, in future imprisonment will be about warehousing.\" I witnessed what he meant. Within two years the jail doubled its population, but had its education budget slashed. Staff and prisoner morale collapsed. Similar changes occurred all over the country. Since then prison numbers have soared, as have suicides, and the best those who serve society can come up with is more of the same.</p> <p>Prison can work, but not if the system is overloaded and under-resourced. And if it is to work in society's best interest, it is imperative that only those that really need to be locked up, are, and that all prisons work towards a positive regime where respect and dignity for inmates is not compromised for misguided reasons.</p> <p>A few weeks ago, Lord Woolf urged politicians to stop \"playing the jail card\". Those who do play a dangerous game of bluff, and there can be no winners in the long run - only more victims.</p> <p>\u0095 Erwin James is serving a life sentence. He writes fortnightly in G2.

Howard spent his days in the education department studying and dreaming of becoming a teacher. Three and a half years later, my next movement order came through. By then Tam had been transferred to Scotland. Dave was in a semi-open prison, let out regularly to take part in charity road runs. And Howard was dead - diabetes-induced coma. One night in bed he went to sleep with his face in the pillow and never woke up. Prison life is mostly a continuous repetition of the same day, over and over again. Finding a purpose and a meaning beyond \"punishment\" can be a struggle. Often people are not in prison long enough to discover anything worthwhile beyond a new set of criminal alliances. Or people end up inside for so long that any good that might have been achieved along the way is undermined by bitterness and resentment. The paradox of imprisonment lies in society's expectations: the community wants retribution, but also rehabilitation. For many, sending people to prison is not enough; they must suffer while there. But only somebody who has never been to prison would believe that jails are \"soft\" places. I remember the campaign a few years ago calling for prisons to be made more \"austere\". But the truth that the austerity brigade failed to grasp is that the harsher a prisoner feels himself to have been treated, the less of an obligation he will feel to abide by society's rules, and the more likely new victims will be created after release. Official figures speak for themselves - more than half of prisoners reoffend within two years of release. I have seen it with my own eyes: a young man serving four years, and not prepared to kowtow to what he sees as the intransigence of the prison regime. Why can't he go out on the exercise yard when it's raining? Why has his mother not been allowed to visit him just because she brought the wrong visiting order by mistake? He gets known as a \"troublemaker\", goes \"on report\", and loses his \"time off for good behaviour\". Less than two years after he is freed, he is back, serving a minimum 25-year sentence. Any connection? A fair answer to Lord Woolf's question would not be entirely bleak. Opportunities for personal advancement abound in prison. I have never been in a jail which did not have an education department, library, gymnasium, chapel, psychologists, probation officers and counsellors. I have been a beneficiary of all the above. When I sat on that bed in that London prison 17 years ago, I never dreamed how my life would be transformed. I could barely string two sentences together; now I sit here with an embarrassment of qualifications, which include Braille transcription, sports leadership, a clutch of O levels and an arts degree. There are many fine people who work in prisons. I recall the cookery teacher who made sure everyone in her class got to make a Christmas cake to send home to their families, even when they couldn't afford the ingredients. The teacher who taught his play-reading group to love Shakespeare. The young prison officer who treated prisoners with such respect that, when he died suddenly, dozens in their best striped shirts lined the route from the gate to the prison to bow their heads to his hearse. And the governor who had the courage to tell a man convicted of brutal crimes that, in his view, considering the man's background, he was as much a victim as his victims. But the fact remains that I've never been in a jail where making prisoners feel good about themselves was a priority. Many prisoners were sceptical about private prisons at first. The morality of making profit from imprisonment seemed questionable at best. But the message began to spread that they were preferable to state-run prisons. A conversation with a prison auxiliary helped me understand why. He had transferred prisoners to a private prison. \"You should see the difference,\" he said. \"As soon as the cons get out of the van, they're greeted with a 'Good morning, Mr Smith, would you like to come this way?' They're reminded that they're people first and prisoners second. Their whole demeanour changes. They're polite in return to the staff, and each other!\" I had to admit I had never been to a prison like that. Prison is designed to disempower. Everyone in jail is vulnerable to a greater or lesser extent. Prisoners live at the mercy of those who are in charge, and of each other, and dignity is a scarce commodity. If the regime is accompanied by an attitude that undermines a prisoner's confidence and self-esteem, then all the stated good intentions will be worth nothing. It is when prisoners feel that they are not being afforded respect as people that the cynical prison culture - the culture of John and the nonce beaters - thrives. During the course of his inquiry, Lord Woolf visited 43 prisoners. When his 600-page report was published, optimism surged through the system. That was until it was all but mothballed by the \"prison works\" philosophy of the mid-90s. More people in prison, the theory went, meant less criminals on the streets, so less crimes being committed. Before this idea took off, the chaplain in a jail I was in told me: \"Mark my words, in future imprisonment will be about warehousing.\" I witnessed what he meant. Within two years the jail doubled its population, but had its education budget slashed. Staff and prisoner morale collapsed. Similar changes occurred all over the country. Since then prison numbers have soared, as have suicides, and the best those who serve society can come up with is more of the same. Prison can work, but not if the system is overloaded and under-resourced. And if it is to work in society's best interest, it is imperative that only those that really need to be locked up, are, and that all prisons work towards a positive regime where respect and dignity for inmates is not compromised for misguided reasons. A few weeks ago, Lord Woolf urged politicians to stop \"playing the jail card\". Those who do play a dangerous game of bluff, and there can be no winners in the long run - only more victims. \u0095 Erwin James is serving a life sentence. He writes fortnightly in G2.

Phil Harding will take up his new job as director of English networks and news at the World Service in the spring. He will take over from Bob Jobbins, who is leaving the BBC after 30 years. \"Phil brings a wealth of experience, great programme flair and a clear understanding of and commitment to the values of the World Service,\" said BBC World Service director Mark Byford. As the man responsible for enforcing the BBC's producer guidelines, Mr Harding steered the corporation through some of its most sensitive decisions. He enforced producer guidelines and helped set standards for taste and decency. As a journalist he says he is delighted to take command of the BBC division which has, arguably, the biggest audience in the world. \"This is a terrific job - literally one of the best in the world - and it offers the unrivalled opportunity to broadcast to and build on the 40m strong audience who listen to and rightly value the World Service in English,\" Mr Harding said. He is a former editor of Radio 4's Today programme and founding head of Radio 5 Live's news programmes department, who has also been the BBC's chief political adviser.",

      "bodyText": "Granada Media and Carlton Communications are close to agreeing a deal for ITV.co.uk. Years after the BBC set up its hugely successful online service, the two companies have finally decided to bury the hatchet and work together in ITV's common interest. The companies, which own 90% of the commercial network, want to create a single, focused ITV website to give them more clout. ITV Online will be the first instance of Granada and Carlton co-operating on moves to create a more integrated and efficient ITV operation. Itv.co.uk was first discussed by Carlton Communications chairman Michael Green in June last year when it was admitted that the ITV companies were lagging behind the BBC in the online arena. Since then, Granada Broadband has taken on much of the responsibility for getting itv.co.uk off the ground. However Granada's own internet ventures have been slow to take off. It has delayed the launch of Granada Powerchannel - a TV spin-off that was to have launched last year. And it is phasing out its G-wizz portal - the home of everything from Coronation Street to London Tonight. Carlton is widely regarded as having a superior internet presence, largely because it has developed a number of strong web brands, such as Jamba, Popcorn and SimplyFood, while Granada went cold on G-wizz almost immediately following its launch. Developments on itv.co.uk are already taking shape and the website now features programme listings, news and links to other ITV sites. Eventually, the plan is to develop the site into a seamless transition between its TV programming and internet services. However, lack of foresight could prevent the ITV companies from expanding their internet plans overseas. Itv.com is currently registered to Nick Rosen, a director of the Online Research Agency and a writer for trade magazine Revolution. His ownership of the domain name runs until November 2002.",

The Research Reshaping project is designed to concentrate the archive and information departments into a single division.

Programme makers, journalists and managers will be able to access all resources - TV and radio footage and text-based archive material - from a single point.

And what will this mean (apart from Lucy helping out with prison patrols?) The biggest obstacle to top-up fees would be gone. </p> <p> \u0095Aspiring teachers seeking information on the internet are met with the disappointing message \"The TTA website will return soon.\" It turns out to be the Tibetan Terriers Association - evidently better known on the internet than the Teacher Training Agency, which perhaps says a lot about the body trying to sort out the current crisis in our classrooms.</p> <p> \u0095Recent history is an appalling record of bloodshed - and that's just what the historians say about eachother. Richard Evans' new edition of In Defence of History out next month glances aside from his main attack on the postmodernist enemy for a sideswipe at Open University professor Arthur Marwick for his \"arrogant and unreflective subjectivity\" and \"gems of homespun wisdom\". \"The main characteristic of the Marwickian metaphor seems to be its complete absence of identifiable meaning\". </p> <p> \u0095A Japanese professor, intrigued by the intense silence in his lectures, switched off the lights to reveal the glow of scores of cellphone monitors. His subsequent survey found two thirds of students admitted receiving or sending text messages on their i-mode phones during classes, and 30% were doing four per lecture on their kei-tais. Universities are now using text messages to chase students up for tuition fees.</p> <p> \u0095The president of Little Big Horn College, Janine Pease-Pretty on Top, has been fired from her job at a meeting of the Crow Tribal Council. She had been criticised for her running of the two-year tribal college founded in 1980 on the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana. Henry Real Bird was named interim president. </p> <p> \u0095Bill Taylor's group investigating whether students should be charged extra fees to help finance universities are having to look over their shoulders. As general election fever hots up, all sorts of proposals for Labour's expected second parliamentary term are being aired. In a Fabian Society report on the reform of private schools, Prof Harry Brighouse argues that extra university fees could yield the money needed to boost spending in state schools.</p> <p>\"People are spending the money before we have even worked out how we might raise it,\" said a bemused Taylor last week.</p> <p>The doomsday scenario of course for university heads is that they incite the wrath of the nation for charging fees, only for the money to be syphoned off elsewhere. The group's report will be delivered to vice-chancellors in March, and a conference to discuss the conclusions is organised for early April - a good month before the general election is due.</p> <p>Stories?

The biggest obstacle to top-up fees would be gone. \u0095Aspiring teachers seeking information on the internet are met with the disappointing message \"The TTA website will return soon.\" It turns out to be the Tibetan Terriers Association - evidently better known on the internet than the Teacher Training Agency, which perhaps says a lot about the body trying to sort out the current crisis in our classrooms. \u0095Recent history is an appalling record of bloodshed - and that's just what the historians say about eachother. Richard Evans' new edition of In Defence of History out next month glances aside from his main attack on the postmodernist enemy for a sideswipe at Open University professor Arthur Marwick for his \"arrogant and unreflective subjectivity\" and \"gems of homespun wisdom\". \"The main characteristic of the Marwickian metaphor seems to be its complete absence of identifiable meaning\". \u0095A Japanese professor, intrigued by the intense silence in his lectures, switched off the lights to reveal the glow of scores of cellphone monitors. His subsequent survey found two thirds of students admitted receiving or sending text messages on their i-mode phones during classes, and 30% were doing four per lecture on their kei-tais. Universities are now using text messages to chase students up for tuition fees. \u0095The president of Little Big Horn College, Janine Pease-Pretty on Top, has been fired from her job at a meeting of the Crow Tribal Council. She had been criticised for her running of the two-year tribal college founded in 1980 on the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana. Henry Real Bird was named interim president. \u0095Bill Taylor's group investigating whether students should be charged extra fees to help finance universities are having to look over their shoulders. As general election fever hots up, all sorts of proposals for Labour's expected second parliamentary term are being aired. In a Fabian Society report on the reform of private schools, Prof Harry Brighouse argues that extra university fees could yield the money needed to boost spending in state schools. \"People are spending the money before we have even worked out how we might raise it,\" said a bemused Taylor last week. The doomsday scenario of course for university heads is that they incite the wrath of the nation for charging fees, only for the money to be syphoned off elsewhere. The group's report will be delivered to vice-chancellors in March, and a conference to discuss the conclusions is organised for early April - a good month before the general election is due. Stories?

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Back in 1871, a supporter of the Paris Commune disguised himself in widows' weeds and took a pot shot at Louis Thiers, the president of the Third Republic. He missed. But although he made no lasting mark on history, he drove the French capital mad for several days. For almost a week, Parisians assumed that every elderly woman who wore a veil had a revolver inside her bodice. Decrepit mourners were stopped on their way to funerals and their wreaths searched for weapons. Children, fearful of being arrested as accessories to attempted murder, refused to go out with their grandmothers.</p> <p>The world has grown up over the past 130 years. But hysteria still bubbles just below the surface of our society. Five days ago it broke out as newspapers attempted to find new culprits in the Hinduja affair. The damage it did to the government was less a deep wound than an irritating rash, which it was reasonable to assume would soon fade. Then Alistair Campbell began to scratch. With the help of Peter Mandelson, he produced a running sore.</p> <p>I remember Campbell telling me that his admiration for Alex Ferguson was built on the Manchester United manager's talent for focusing on the main objective. All that mattered was winning. How, I wonder, did the prime minister's press secretary imagine that using a lobby briefing to denounce Mandelson's character weaknesses would serve the greater objective of a Labour victory at the next election?</p> <p>By writing his unintelligible article for the Sunday Times, Mandelson confirmed the Campbell diagnosis. The retraction of a confession is the mark of an old lag who has run out of excuses. Clearly, something very strange has been going on inside poor Peter's head. A couple of years ago he would have realised that a politician who complains that he has been bullied into admitting misdemeanours of which he is innocent is doomed.</p> <p>Campbell clearly detected the nervous state before the Sunday Times gibberish was written. But that was no excuse for gratuitously drawing attention to it. In politics, to be cruel is sometimes forgivable. To be counterproductive is not. Once again, Campbell's own character weaknesses - different from Mandelson's but none the less dangerous - have damaged the cause he believed he was serving.</p> <p>If Mandelson was not finished before the weekend, he is now. Yet there can be no serious complaint about a telephone call to a junior Home Office minister to ask about the Hindujas' passport application. And I would have seen nothing wrong in him expressing support for their attempt to become British. After all, one of the criteria for nationality is \"good character\". Who better to confirm that they possess it than a secretary of state? The offence, as admitted on Wednesday, was a silly lie about how the message was conveyed. Now Mandelson says that he did not tell the truth about the lie. Either way, it is hardly the conduct of a statesman. But a statement of the facts both confirms the triviality of the whole affair and the still unspoken truth about last week's events. The passing of Peter is not very important.</p> <p>The pressure of the moment is so great that it is difficult to write about last week's excesses without announcing general support for the howling pack of virtue. If I am incriminated by drawing attention to some of the nonsense that last week's events provoked, I shall accept with good grace that I fall below the high standards that William Hague expects in politicians - David Willetts, for example, who resigned from the government after deceiving a select committee and is now a member of the shadow cabinet.</p> <p>Painful as Mr Hague's disapproval will be, I cannot pretend that Peter Mandelson's departure has changed the course of Labour party history. Mandelson was undoubtedly the architect of \"the project\". But the part of that initiative with which he was most intimately associated was being discarded long before last Wednesday. The notion that Labour could be elected only if it abandoned all its traditional values died with Gordon Brown's 2000 spending review; and the obsequies were spoken over the corpse by Tony Blair in Brighton last October. For the first time at a Labour conference, he sounded like a Labour prime minister. Next evening, at a fringe meeting, I heard Mandelson beg the party to accept that the continuous revolution against socialism would go on. Few in the audience believed him.</p> <p>During the past couple of years, Labour has found its ideological feet. Gordon Brown's version of communitarianism is not altogether to my taste. Its emphasis on rewarding effort sometimes ignores need. But it has more in common with real social democracy than could possibly be claimed for the managerial nihilism of The Blair Revolution, the intellectually shaming description of New Labour philosophy that Mandelson wrote with Roger Liddle. Brown's ideas are now edging their way into the prime minister's speeches. Mandelson's theory that it was essential to ditch socialism was, like him, only briefly fashionable.</p> <p>After the general election - which last week's events will barely influence - the chancellor's strength can only increase. Because of his management of the economy, he will be discreetly hailed as the architect of victory. The next Labour leader is either Brown or somebody nobody has yet thought of. No sensible punter backs a horse that has yet to enter the race. Mandelson was never in the frame, nor was he likely to train another winner. Brown has lost a distraction, not a competitor.</p> <p>Mandelson became associated with three great enterprises - entry into the European single currency, alliance with the Liberals and proportional representation. It would be hard to argue that he was able to persuade the prime minister to take early or decisive action on any one of those vital issues. When the time comes they will be decided by pressures beyond the control of even the late secretary of state for Northern Ireland - their effect on the future of the Labour government.

      "bodyText": "Back in 1871, a supporter of the Paris Commune disguised himself in widows' weeds and took a pot shot at Louis Thiers, the president of the Third Republic. He missed. But although he made no lasting mark on history, he drove the French capital mad for several days. For almost a week, Parisians assumed that every elderly woman who wore a veil had a revolver inside her bodice. Decrepit mourners were stopped on their way to funerals and their wreaths searched for weapons. Children, fearful of being arrested as accessories to attempted murder, refused to go out with their grandmothers. The world has grown up over the past 130 years. But hysteria still bubbles just below the surface of our society. Five days ago it broke out as newspapers attempted to find new culprits in the Hinduja affair. The damage it did to the government was less a deep wound than an irritating rash, which it was reasonable to assume would soon fade. Then Alistair Campbell began to scratch. With the help of Peter Mandelson, he produced a running sore. I remember Campbell telling me that his admiration for Alex Ferguson was built on the Manchester United manager's talent for focusing on the main objective. All that mattered was winning. How, I wonder, did the prime minister's press secretary imagine that using a lobby briefing to denounce Mandelson's character weaknesses would serve the greater objective of a Labour victory at the next election? By writing his unintelligible article for the Sunday Times, Mandelson confirmed the Campbell diagnosis. The retraction of a confession is the mark of an old lag who has run out of excuses. Clearly, something very strange has been going on inside poor Peter's head. A couple of years ago he would have realised that a politician who complains that he has been bullied into admitting misdemeanours of which he is innocent is doomed. Campbell clearly detected the nervous state before the Sunday Times gibberish was written. But that was no excuse for gratuitously drawing attention to it. In politics, to be cruel is sometimes forgivable. To be counterproductive is not. Once again, Campbell's own character weaknesses - different from Mandelson's but none the less dangerous - have damaged the cause he believed he was serving. If Mandelson was not finished before the weekend, he is now. Yet there can be no serious complaint about a telephone call to a junior Home Office minister to ask about the Hindujas' passport application. And I would have seen nothing wrong in him expressing support for their attempt to become British. After all, one of the criteria for nationality is \"good character\". Who better to confirm that they possess it than a secretary of state? The offence, as admitted on Wednesday, was a silly lie about how the message was conveyed. Now Mandelson says that he did not tell the truth about the lie. Either way, it is hardly the conduct of a statesman. But a statement of the facts both confirms the triviality of the whole affair and the still unspoken truth about last week's events. The passing of Peter is not very important. The pressure of the moment is so great that it is difficult to write about last week's excesses without announcing general support for the howling pack of virtue. If I am incriminated by drawing attention to some of the nonsense that last week's events provoked, I shall accept with good grace that I fall below the high standards that William Hague expects in politicians - David Willetts, for example, who resigned from the government after deceiving a select committee and is now a member of the shadow cabinet. Painful as Mr Hague's disapproval will be, I cannot pretend that Peter Mandelson's departure has changed the course of Labour party history. Mandelson was undoubtedly the architect of \"the project\". But the part of that initiative with which he was most intimately associated was being discarded long before last Wednesday. The notion that Labour could be elected only if it abandoned all its traditional values died with Gordon Brown's 2000 spending review; and the obsequies were spoken over the corpse by Tony Blair in Brighton last October. For the first time at a Labour conference, he sounded like a Labour prime minister. Next evening, at a fringe meeting, I heard Mandelson beg the party to accept that the continuous revolution against socialism would go on. Few in the audience believed him. During the past couple of years, Labour has found its ideological feet. Gordon Brown's version of communitarianism is not altogether to my taste. Its emphasis on rewarding effort sometimes ignores need. But it has more in common with real social democracy than could possibly be claimed for the managerial nihilism of The Blair Revolution, the intellectually shaming description of New Labour philosophy that Mandelson wrote with Roger Liddle. Brown's ideas are now edging their way into the prime minister's speeches. Mandelson's theory that it was essential to ditch socialism was, like him, only briefly fashionable. After the general election - which last week's events will barely influence - the chancellor's strength can only increase. Because of his management of the economy, he will be discreetly hailed as the architect of victory. The next Labour leader is either Brown or somebody nobody has yet thought of. No sensible punter backs a horse that has yet to enter the race. Mandelson was never in the frame, nor was he likely to train another winner. Brown has lost a distraction, not a competitor. Mandelson became associated with three great enterprises - entry into the European single currency, alliance with the Liberals and proportional representation. It would be hard to argue that he was able to persuade the prime minister to take early or decisive action on any one of those vital issues. When the time comes they will be decided by pressures beyond the control of even the late secretary of state for Northern Ireland - their effect on the future of the Labour government. Nothing has changed. It is convenient for commentators and Conservatives to claim otherwise. And it is a tribute to Mandelson's reckless skills that it is possible to pretend that his resignation marks a decisive shift in Labour's prospects and policies. There are no certainties in politics, but the chances of the Mandelson affair having much effect on history are only slightly greater than the risk of the prime minister being shot by a communist disguised as an old lady. \u0095 Peter Preston's column will appear tomorrow. comment@theguardian.com Special report New Labour in power Related articles 29.01.2001: Cabinet cuts off Mandelson 29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows 29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached' 29.01.2001: Brother deals new blow to Vaz 29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control 28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go 25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins 25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me Audio 24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement Photo gallery Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures Cartoon Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson The 1998 home loan row Text of resignation letter 24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan 24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour Mandelson resigns over his home loan Rivals in the Labour party How Mandy replaced Mo Talk about it Have your say on the Mandelson affair Useful links Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001 24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement Hinduja group history Downing Street press briefing Hartlepool Mail",

Within Downing Street the surprise will be not that Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson have fallen out so publicly but that the falling out has taken so long to become public. Mr Campbell, the Sultan of Spin, and Mr Mandelson, the Svengali of Spin, have been rivals as well as comrades for more than a decade. While they agreed on many key issues such as the need to transform the Labour party into new Labour with Tony Blair a presidential figure, they also disagreed on key issues from the single currency to a cosier relationship with the Liberal Democrats via electoral reform. Since 1994 the pair have tussled for Mr Blair's ear in a battle won last week when Mr Mandelson was banished from the inner court of No 10. As one Blairite MP, who knows both men well, put it: \"The first time Peter resigned, Alastair gave him a tearful hug before Peter walked out of the door. This time Alastair opened the door. That says it all.\" The tensions rarely surfaced in opposition when they were united in promoting new Labour and Mr Blair, although Mr Campbell used one of his final columns in the now defunct Today newspaper before joining team Blair in 1994 to make a mild dig about Mr Mandelson's inability to write - a dig intended to show he wanted to be boss. Their friendship stretches back some time and shortly before the 1987 election when the News of the World decided to \"out\" Mr Mandelson, Mr Campbell and his partner Fiona Millar invited him to spend the Saturday night before publication at their north London home. When Mr Mandelson stepped down as Labour's director of communications before the 1992 election to stand in Hartlepool, he needed a new income so Mr Campbell fixed him up with a column in the Sunday People. A column Mr Campbell was to ghost for his friend. When a combination of stress at work and heavy drinking led to Mr Campbell suffering a breakdown during the late 1980s, Mr Mandelson was one of the first to call offering his sympathy and support. The Westminster rumour mill even has it that Mr Mandelson once did a spot of baby-sitting for his old mate. The first sign in government of what was to come occurred in November 1997 when the Bernie Ecclestone affair erupted and plunged Mr Blair into his first major sleaze scandal. Mr Campbell, the prime minister's official press secretary, advised Mr Blair almost immediately to come clean and get all the facts into the open, including an admission it had been a \u00a31m donation. Mr Mandelson, the prime minister's unofficial counsellor, advised Mr Blair to say as little as possible, keeping the seven-figure sum a secret. The prime minister took the advice of Mr Mandelson and Mr Campbell was barely able to conceal his anger when the information leaked out anyway and the premier was forced to say sorry. In the new Labour revolution, Mr Campbell has always been a roundhead to Mandelson's cavalier, the family man who enjoys an early night (except when he is watching football or going to a Britney Spears concert) while Mr Mandelson the social butterfly flutters from one drinks party to another. He drafted Mr Mandelson's resignation letter in December 1998 after the \u00a3373,000 Geoffrey Robinson home loan was disclosed and shed a genuine tear when he had to quit. Yet Mr Campbell, it has been said by several government special advisers, believes Mr Blair was wrong to bring Mr Mandelson back into the government so quickly after his first resignation. The relationship between a pair once so close was certainly less close from autumn 1999 when Mr Mandelson returned as Northern Ireland secretary and, after he self-destructed a second time last week. A former aide to Mr Mandelson admitted: \"It is true that relations between Peter and Alastair had been strained since Peter's return but it is also true much of that was on Alastair's side. Relations between Peter and Tony were still very good.\" Some claimed that Mr Campbell thought it looked like an indecent haste, leaving the prime minister open to accusations of favouring \"Tony's cronies\". Others suggested that he had rather liked running the spin show on his own from the inside and feared Mr Mandelson might be a liability. Significantly, perhaps, relations between Gordon Brown, sworn enemies with Mr Mandelson, and Mr Campbell have improved markedly since the press secretary was fingered three years ago for the \"psychological flaws\" attack on the chancellor. Mr Mandelson's long justification published yesterday was commissioned before Mr Campbell's lobby briefing and the former Mirror man almost certainly knew what was coming, whether he had been consulted or not. His insistence yesterday that he had been quoted out of context, and Mr Mandelson's presence at a family party at Mr Campbell's home on Saturday was proof of their enduring friendship, will raise a few eyebrows in the Labour hierarchy. Mr Campbell is an experienced operator who knows that in briefings to the Sunday lobby one word out of place, let alone sentence after sentence, can send the wrong signals. Mr Blair famously remarked that he knew he would have fully transformed the Labour party when it had learned to love Peter Mandelson. The prime minister may be very disappointed. It seems that Mr Mandelson, whatever the public statements to the contrary, is losing existing friends rather than finding new ones.

He's kind of had enough.\"</p> <p>Mr Campbell, whose attack is said to have deeply upset Mr Mandelson, attempted to distance himself from the remarks yesterday. Mr Campbell did not deny the words attributed to him, but said that the interpretation placed on them highlighted the \"current media frenzy\".</p> <p>His defence was rejected by all the political editors who attended the lobby briefing on Friday afternoon. Writing in today's Guardian, the Observer's political editor Kamal Ahmed says: \"The mood and tone of the briefing was clear. Mandelson was not the man he used to be, politically at least.\"</p> <p>Downing Street's attempts to distance itself from Mr Mandelson - even before the Friday briefing - played a hand in convincing him to put his side of the saga on the record. Mr Mandelson highlighted the end of his political alliance with Mr Blair when he wrote of how he lost the will to fight for the first time in his life during his fateful meeting with the prime minister.</p> <p>\"I felt isolated,\" he wrote. \"I knew I hadn't done anything wrong, but I had no time to prove it. I agreed to resign and the prime minister - understandably, given the presentation of the facts - did not try to dissuade me. I should have fought for time to allow a fuller examination of the facts.\"</p> <p>Friends of Mr Mandelson, who left the country last night, said that he decided to speak up after civil servants, who worked with him in 1998 when he made the crucial telephone call on behalf of the Hinduja brothers, backed his version of events.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson insists that the main contact with the home office was made by his officials, though they cannot rule out that he made the contentious phone call to the home office minister Mike O'Brien. It was Mr Mandelson's failure to tell Downing Street about this conversation which led to his downfall.</p> <p>However, Mr Mandelson's lengthy article only served to tarnish his reputation even further after he admitted that a week before his resignation Mr Straw reminded him of the telephone conversation with Mr O'Brien. He also admitted that he tried to cover up his involvement in the Hindujas' passport application in a written parliamentary answer.</p> <p>Mr Straw spoke of the importance of politicians telling the truth. \"I regard it is of the highest importance that when answering questions to journalists ... but above all to parliament that we should give the whole truth and ensure these answers are as full as possible.\"</p> <p>The Tories claimed last night that Downing Street was \"locked in open war\" with Mr Mandelson in an attempt to \"deflect attention away from Mr Blair's direct responsibility for the causes of this mess\". He added: \"The Blair government, built as it is on spin, lies and deception, is unravelling.\"</p> <p>But there were signs that Mr Mandelson and Downing Street may eventually patch up their differences.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson attended a party at Mr Campbell's north London house on Saturday night to celebrate the birthday of Audrey Millar, the mother of the partner of the prime minister's official spokesman. Mrs Millar is a stalwart of the north London Labour party.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson and Mr Campbell are said to have read the first editions of the Sunday newspapers late on Saturday night after Mr Campbell tipped him off about what they were likely to contain.</p> <p><b>Special report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">New Labour in power</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430254,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430250,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430253,00.html\">29.01.2001: Brother deals new blow to Vaz</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430189,00.html\">29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430167,00.html\">29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,429979,00.html\">28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427850,00.html\">25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,427840,00.html\">25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/graphic/0,7367,428461,00.html\">Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427471,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done</a></p> <p><b>Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369240,00.html\">Mandelson resigns over his home loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369238,00.html\">Rivals in the Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,366690,00.html\">How Mandy replaced Mo</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7e6ee\">Have your say on the Mandelson affair</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/01/28/stifocnws02001.html\" target=\"_new\">Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageId=3284\" target=\"_new\">Downing Street press briefing</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a></p>",

The prime minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell, described Mr Mandelson as \"slightly detached\". In a briefing for lobby journalists working for the Sunday newspapers, Mr Campbell compared Mr Mandelson's state of mind to that of Ron Davies who was forced to resign after a \"moment of madness\" on Clapham Commons in 1998. \"Part of the problem, and Peter would accept this, I think, is that there were things that Peter cannot explain and cannot explain to himself,\" Mr Campbell said. \"I think he has been slightly detached.\" His remarks, which highlighted the rift between two of the main architects of New Labour, were echoed in stronger terms by Downing Street sources who told the Observer that Mr Mandelson had been \"unfocused\". \"He's been a little bit like that for a while,\" the source said. \"He's fed up with it. He's kind of had enough.\" Mr Campbell, whose attack is said to have deeply upset Mr Mandelson, attempted to distance himself from the remarks yesterday. Mr Campbell did not deny the words attributed to him, but said that the interpretation placed on them highlighted the \"current media frenzy\". His defence was rejected by all the political editors who attended the lobby briefing on Friday afternoon. Writing in today's Guardian, the Observer's political editor Kamal Ahmed says: \"The mood and tone of the briefing was clear. Mandelson was not the man he used to be, politically at least.\" Downing Street's attempts to distance itself from Mr Mandelson - even before the Friday briefing - played a hand in convincing him to put his side of the saga on the record. Mr Mandelson highlighted the end of his political alliance with Mr Blair when he wrote of how he lost the will to fight for the first time in his life during his fateful meeting with the prime minister. \"I felt isolated,\" he wrote. \"I knew I hadn't done anything wrong, but I had no time to prove it. I agreed to resign and the prime minister - understandably, given the presentation of the facts - did not try to dissuade me. I should have fought for time to allow a fuller examination of the facts.\" Friends of Mr Mandelson, who left the country last night, said that he decided to speak up after civil servants, who worked with him in 1998 when he made the crucial telephone call on behalf of the Hinduja brothers, backed his version of events. Mr Mandelson insists that the main contact with the home office was made by his officials, though they cannot rule out that he made the contentious phone call to the home office minister Mike O'Brien. It was Mr Mandelson's failure to tell Downing Street about this conversation which led to his downfall. However, Mr Mandelson's lengthy article only served to tarnish his reputation even further after he admitted that a week before his resignation Mr Straw reminded him of the telephone conversation with Mr O'Brien. He also admitted that he tried to cover up his involvement in the Hindujas' passport application in a written parliamentary answer. Mr Straw spoke of the importance of politicians telling the truth. \"I regard it is of the highest importance that when answering questions to journalists ... but above all to parliament that we should give the whole truth and ensure these answers are as full as possible.\" The Tories claimed last night that Downing Street was \"locked in open war\" with Mr Mandelson in an attempt to \"deflect attention away from Mr Blair's direct responsibility for the causes of this mess\". He added: \"The Blair government, built as it is on spin, lies and deception, is unravelling.\" But there were signs that Mr Mandelson and Downing Street may eventually patch up their differences. Mr Mandelson attended a party at Mr Campbell's north London house on Saturday night to celebrate the birthday of Audrey Millar, the mother of the partner of the prime minister's official spokesman. Mrs Millar is a stalwart of the north London Labour party. Mr Mandelson and Mr Campbell are said to have read the first editions of the Sunday newspapers late on Saturday night after Mr Campbell tipped him off about what they were likely to contain.

In a damaging blow to Mr Vaz, who is fighting for his political life, one of the brothers admitted that he spoke to Mr Vaz last year about his rights as a British citizen in the face of the Indian inquiry. On BBC1's Breakfast with Frost, Srichand Hinduja said: \"We have inquired because he [is] the foreign minister - what is the protection they give to British citizens.\" The brothers are being questioned in India by the central bureau of investigation about their alleged involvement in bribes paid during the long-running Bofors arms scandal.

Mr Vaz has admitted that he made representations on behalf of their applications for passports, but insisted that he did so before he became a minister. Further evidence of Mr Vaz's extensive contacts with the brothers was revealed yesterday when a former Tory frontbencher said that the Europe minister had acted as if he were their \"PPS\" - a ministerial bag carrier - before he became a minister. Christopher Chope, the MP for Christchurch, said he was surprised to receive a call in November 1998 from Mr Vaz after he raised questions in a newspaper about their contribution to the Dome.

      "body": "<p>It is one of those phrases that will sum up the political mood of the times. \"Slightly detached\" has the same ring of longevity about it as \"psychological flaws\" or \"moment of madness\". It will last.</p> <p>It was said by Alastair Campbell at a briefing of Sunday lobby journalists on Friday afternoon. I was there, along with most of the political editors of the Sunday newspapers. It was a remarkable hour and a quarter.</p> <p>The week, of course, had been one of high drama. As it drew to a close on Friday the public address system in the press gallery of the Commons sparked into life. \"There will be a briefing for the Sunday lobby at 1.30pm at Downing Street.\" It was 12.30pm.</p> <p>We trooped over to No 10 and made our way down the stairs to the room where Mr Campbell would meet us. He was 10 minutes late, clasping, as usual, a Burnley FC mug of tea. Behind him was Godric Smith, his deputy.</p> <p>\"Right, what do you want to talk about?\" Mr Campbell said as he sat facing us. It is his usual opening line.</p> <p>There was only one subject. We were all keen to get to the bottom of why, exactly, Peter Mandelson had thought it wise not to tell the truth when first questioned by the Observer over the Hinduja passport applications.</p> <p>Mr Campbell was willing to talk about it. In fact he had obviously come prepared for a lengthy discussion because after each question he gave long and frank answers - so long in fact that he had to send out for another cup of tea. This was a \"two-mug\" lobby. That is in stark contrast to some of the meetings when he will go little further than what he tells the daily journalists during the week.</p> <p>The prime minister's official spokesman went through the week in detail, describing what he thought had been going on and the difficulties he had faced.</p> <p>We kept returning to the question of why Mr Mandelson acted as he had. Mr Campbell seemed genuinely perplexed and, with no prompting, said: \"There are parts of this Peter cannot explain and cannot explain to himself. I think he has been slightly detached.\"</p> <p>This was an odd phrase to choose as the last time anyone can remember it being used in a lobby briefing was when Ron Davies resigned after a \"moment of madness\" on Clapham Common. That was the reason Mr Campbell was questioned about the connection between the two ministers.</p> <p>He was asked whether Mr Mandelson's state of mind was in any way similar to the state of Mr Davies's in 1998. \"I think it was,\" he replied.</p> <p>There was an implication throughout the briefing that Mr Mandelson had not been focusing on the political issues in the way that he usually would. And far from simply being connected with this one case, Mr Campbell said that he had noticed it for some time.</p> <p>What is most surprising about all this is that Mr Campbell is not someone who just breezes into meetings and says the first thing that comes into his head. He chooses his words carefully. When asked, as he often is, whether when he said Y he really meant (usually a more newsworthy) X his response is: \"I'll choose the words I use, not you.\"</p> <p>On this occasion there was no pushing him towards saying something he did not really want to say. In fact he returned to the subject several times, talking about the stress Mr Mandelson had been under and saying that the former Northern Ireland secretary \"wanted to get out of frontline politics\". The tone of the briefing was clear: Mr Mandelson was not the man he used to be, politically at least.</p> <p>I remember chatting to one of my colleagues later that evening. We agreed that the briefing had been remarkable. When Mr Mandelson's article for the Sunday Times was added to the rich mix, there was obviously something serious going on. I do not know whether Mr Mandelson wrote the piece because he had heard about the briefing and decided to respond. But whenever he agreed to the commission, his words could not be in starker contrast to Mr Campbell's.</p> <p>There was Mr Campbell saying that Mr Mandelson wanted to be out of the spotlight. There was Mr Mandelson revealing that he wanted to be at the centre of it. There was Mr Campbell saying that Mr Mandelson did not seem to have a grasp of the facts. There was Mr Mandelson giving an account of every cough and spit of the affair.</p> <p>That Mr Campbell has attacked the coverage of the story is not surprising. What else was he going to do?

      "bodyText": "It is one of those phrases that will sum up the political mood of the times. \"Slightly detached\" has the same ring of longevity about it as \"psychological flaws\" or \"moment of madness\". It will last. It was said by Alastair Campbell at a briefing of Sunday lobby journalists on Friday afternoon. I was there, along with most of the political editors of the Sunday newspapers. It was a remarkable hour and a quarter. The week, of course, had been one of high drama. As it drew to a close on Friday the public address system in the press gallery of the Commons sparked into life. \"There will be a briefing for the Sunday lobby at 1.30pm at Downing Street.\" It was 12.30pm. We trooped over to No 10 and made our way down the stairs to the room where Mr Campbell would meet us. He was 10 minutes late, clasping, as usual, a Burnley FC mug of tea. Behind him was Godric Smith, his deputy. \"Right, what do you want to talk about?\" Mr Campbell said as he sat facing us. It is his usual opening line. There was only one subject. We were all keen to get to the bottom of why, exactly, Peter Mandelson had thought it wise not to tell the truth when first questioned by the Observer over the Hinduja passport applications. Mr Campbell was willing to talk about it. In fact he had obviously come prepared for a lengthy discussion because after each question he gave long and frank answers - so long in fact that he had to send out for another cup of tea. This was a \"two-mug\" lobby. That is in stark contrast to some of the meetings when he will go little further than what he tells the daily journalists during the week. The prime minister's official spokesman went through the week in detail, describing what he thought had been going on and the difficulties he had faced. We kept returning to the question of why Mr Mandelson acted as he had. Mr Campbell seemed genuinely perplexed and, with no prompting, said: \"There are parts of this Peter cannot explain and cannot explain to himself. I think he has been slightly detached.\" This was an odd phrase to choose as the last time anyone can remember it being used in a lobby briefing was when Ron Davies resigned after a \"moment of madness\" on Clapham Common. That was the reason Mr Campbell was questioned about the connection between the two ministers. He was asked whether Mr Mandelson's state of mind was in any way similar to the state of Mr Davies's in 1998. \"I think it was,\" he replied. There was an implication throughout the briefing that Mr Mandelson had not been focusing on the political issues in the way that he usually would. And far from simply being connected with this one case, Mr Campbell said that he had noticed it for some time. What is most surprising about all this is that Mr Campbell is not someone who just breezes into meetings and says the first thing that comes into his head. He chooses his words carefully. When asked, as he often is, whether when he said Y he really meant (usually a more newsworthy) X his response is: \"I'll choose the words I use, not you.\" On this occasion there was no pushing him towards saying something he did not really want to say. In fact he returned to the subject several times, talking about the stress Mr Mandelson had been under and saying that the former Northern Ireland secretary \"wanted to get out of frontline politics\". The tone of the briefing was clear: Mr Mandelson was not the man he used to be, politically at least. I remember chatting to one of my colleagues later that evening. We agreed that the briefing had been remarkable. When Mr Mandelson's article for the Sunday Times was added to the rich mix, there was obviously something serious going on. I do not know whether Mr Mandelson wrote the piece because he had heard about the briefing and decided to respond. But whenever he agreed to the commission, his words could not be in starker contrast to Mr Campbell's. There was Mr Campbell saying that Mr Mandelson wanted to be out of the spotlight. There was Mr Mandelson revealing that he wanted to be at the centre of it. There was Mr Campbell saying that Mr Mandelson did not seem to have a grasp of the facts. There was Mr Mandelson giving an account of every cough and spit of the affair. That Mr Campbell has attacked the coverage of the story is not surprising. What else was he going to do? That he said the things he said is also beyond dispute as anyone who listens to a tape of the proceedings would agree. If he had wanted to kill the Downing Street end of the story he could have given us a few bland statements. Mr Campbell never says anything by mistake.

This year's festival has attracted criticism for failing to ignite the buying frenzy from major distributors that has been seen in previous years. Others, however, have commended Sundance for resisting what they see as a move towards the mainstream. In its choice of award winners, supporters say, the festival has returned to its original independent roots.</p> <p>This year's Dramatic Grand Jury Prize went to <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0247199\">The Believer</a> (pictured), a troubling, provocative study of American bigotry from writer-director Henry Bean. Based on a true story, The Believer tells the story of Danny Balintas (played by Ryan Gosling), a Jewish kid who comes to revile his heritage as he allies himself with Nazism.

      "bodyText": "The Sundance International Film Festival wrapped up on Saturday night by distributing awards to a brace of low-budget and left-field independent productions. This year's festival has attracted criticism for failing to ignite the buying frenzy from major distributors that has been seen in previous years. Others, however, have commended Sundance for resisting what they see as a move towards the mainstream. In its choice of award winners, supporters say, the festival has returned to its original independent roots. This year's Dramatic Grand Jury Prize went to The Believer (pictured), a troubling, provocative study of American bigotry from writer-director Henry Bean. Based on a true story, The Believer tells the story of Danny Balintas (played by Ryan Gosling), a Jewish kid who comes to revile his heritage as he allies himself with Nazism. Accepting the award, a dazzled Bean admitted that he was surprised his film even made it onto the festival line-up. A Special Jury Prize was also awarded to Sissy Spacek and British actor Tom Wilkinson for their roles as an anguished middle-class couple in the family saga In the Bedroom. The skateboard scene film Dogtown won the Audience Award for Best Documentary. Meanwhile other festival winners spotlighted an overall fascination with gender issues. \"It's a tranny kind of Sundance and we're enjoying that,\" quipped John Cameron Mitchell, director and star of the transsexual rock opera Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Mitchell was on stage to pick up the Audience Awards for Best Film and Best Director. \"I do like a warm hand on my entrance,\" he told the assembled crowd. Elsewhere, Southern Comfort, Kate Davis's film about female to male transsexual Robert Eads, took the Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary. \"Sundance has always been on the front line of gay-themed work, but I feel there's a shift going on,\" said Tom Shepard, director of Scout's Honor, a documentary implicitly attacking institutionalised homophobia within US society. \"It's great to see straight people taking a stand.

      "body": "<p>Davie was shivering, drenched from Adidas anorak hood to Reebok trainers with the day-long freezing rain. Standing on the corner at the entrance to some flats, he had been managing to squeeze out the odd word, but the longer we waited, the faster his conversation deteriorated from nervy gibbering to non-existent - as he focused on hissing a stream of expletives. </p> <p>It was getting on for nine hours since Davie, 21, had had his last injection of heroin and his dealer was 30 minutes late. Another five, painful-to-watch minutes like this, and then the dealer appeared. </p> <p>Barely older than Davie and dressed almost identically, he started to utter something which might be a greeting, but the client had waited too long for small talk. Inside the dealer's flat, the business was done quickly: \u00a320 for a tin-foil wrap of a tenth of a gramme. Immediately, Davie went to work, cooking up the drug on a spoon over the flame of lighter. Holding the syringe in one trembling hand, he injected into a vein in the other. And the trembling stopped. </p> <p>We were not sitting in Glasgow, Liverpool or London, and Davie is no deprived no-hope youngster from a sink council estate. Two days after we met, he would be back at his post on a fishing trawler operating out of the North Sea port of Fraserburgh, population 21,000, 40 miles north of Aberdeen and the undisputed drug abuse capital of Britain. </p> <p>Fraserburgh should reek not just of the sea, but of the affluence it has generated for 400 years. Home to the second-largest fishing fleet in Britain, the harbour is filled with modern trawlers worth up to \u00a3200,000 each. Even in these trying days of falling stocks and EU quotas, the men who crew these boats can bring in \u00a330,000 a year, the owners and skippers even more. Look closely around Fraserburgh and the trappings of high income are there: the BMWs and Audis, the gaudy, modern bungalows on the outskirts of town. </p> <p>'We are in the middle of a bloody disaster,' said Sandy Wisley, a local doctor. 'If this was Glasgow or London, there would be a public outcry, but because we're a tiny place stuck away up here in the top corner, nobody is interested.' </p> <p>The cold statistics compiled by Wisley at his Finlayson Street surgery are staggering. One in five young men in his practice, which covers 13,000 of the town's population, is a drug addict. About 70 per cent work on the trawlers, or did until they could no longer juggle their habits and their jobs. Wisley is treating more than 230 addicts and claims that two new ones come to him every week. Between February and April 1998, the practice prescribed 3,622 tablets of the opiate substitute dihydrocodeine; in the same period last year, more than 83,000 tablets - known as 'diffs' by users - were prescribed. The current tally is running above 90,000. </p> <p>In total, there are about 450 heroin users in the town, more than 2 per cent of the population. On average, they consume about \u00a380 of heroin each a day, more than \u00a329,000 a year. Spread over the whole population, from infants to pensioners, that means heroin is costing every single person in Fraserburgh about \u00a3800 each a year. Dealers can make \u00a35,000 a week here, but not all of this is profit; a substantial percentage of their income is used by the dealers to feed their own habits. 'It would be a great living if I didn't have to shoot so much up my arm,' said Davie's dealer. </p> <p>Heroin has taken a heavy toll on Fraserburgh's young population. On 30 December the town achieved the dubious distinction of being home to Scotland's last drugs fatality of 2000. Richard Smith, 24, had been a familiar face in the local drugs scene for years, but on the Saturday before New Year the heroin addict was found dead at a house in the village of St Combs, just outside Fraserburgh. His death was the 140th in the area since 1996, when the scale of the drugs problem began to emerge. </p> <p>'We first spotted the drugs problem in the early 1990s, but in 1997 it just exploded.' Wisley explains. 'Now, if I walk down the high street and 20 young lads say hello to me, you can bet that 15 of them will be addicts. And the only reason is money. These kids come back off the boats with a few thousand pounds a month in their pockets, and they don't know what else to do with it. In the past it would have been fast cars and drink binges, now it is drugs.' </p> <p>That is exactly how it was with Davie. He has not reached the stage where he has had to sell off the television, the hi-fi or the PlayStation, but his flat was in chaos, smelling of unwashed clothes and fish. </p> <p>'You come back after 10 days or whatever at sea and you are ready to party,' he says. 'You've got money in your pocket and a bit of time on your hands, so you go a bit wild. I used to get mad pissed, but all around you your mates are taking pills, doing a bit of blow, and you get sucked into it.' </p> <p>If there is one thing that Fraserburgh can be grateful for, it is that it has avoided much of the crime that usually follows in the wake of a drug epidemic. 'Kids don't really need to steal around here to finance their habits,' says Davie. 'Most of them make enough on their own, and when they can't earn any more they can con the money from their families.' </p> <p>But drugs agencies and police are becoming increasingly concerned about the quantity of crack cocaine making its way into the lucrative Fraserburgh drugs market. </p> <p>More and more addicts are testing positive for it. Doctors like Wisley are treating people whose heart rates are up at 190 beats a minute after crack binges, and some appear to be using the drug in combination with heroin in an attempt to increase the intensity of the fix. </p> <p>There have even been crack cocaine 'parties' in some of the outlying villages. 'Cocaine used to be practically non-existent around here,' said Wisley. 'Now we are seeing it in urine tests all the time.' </p> <p>One senior drugs worker said: 'I can't really see these fishermen's cottages being turned into crack houses, but at least the rich kids are reverting to type and going for the expensive stuff.' </p> <p>At \u00a350 a rock, which provides a hit lasting less than an hour, the financial incentive is enormous. But with crack comes serious violence. One small-time dealer was recently held hostage by the gang which supplies him because they suspected he had given information to the police. For hours, he was held in a room and tortured. A crossbow bolt was shot into his right leg below the knee, and his face was beaten so badly it has taken three weeks for the bruising around his eyes to subside. </p> <p>Last August police raids in Fraserburgh uncovered a selection of weapons typically associated with inner-city drugs gangs: a samurai sword, a crossbow, knives, substantial quantities of drugs, and thousands of pounds in cash. In all, seven arrests were made. </p> <p>'It is the dealers who are fuelling the market,' said one local user, who refused to be named. 'They started using it themselves, so they are trying to build up a market so they can bring in the gear and take a cut of it for themselves.' </p> <p>Back in his flat, Davie was already starting to plan his next hit. Within 48 hours, he would be back at sea, taking dihydrocodeine tablets to control his withdrawal symptoms. 'The day I lose my job will be the day I stop using the smack,' he said. Until then, he has his cravings to attend to.</p>",

      "body": "<p>By 9am most mornings, the market in the unassuming town of Bhachau is a busy place. Last Friday was no exception. The vegetable seller was putting the finishing touches on his cart, laying out a row of chillies. Mothers were buying shoes for their children. Shopkeepers were chatting and drinking tea. At the primary school, 300 excited small girls were parading to celebrate India's Republic Day. Within a minute, as giant tremors ripped through the lane, almost all of them were dead - drowned under a tidal wave of masonry. </p> <p>Of all the towns affected by last week's catastrophic earthquake in India, Bhachau has been the most devastated. Before last week some 25,000 people lived here. Rescuers say they can find only 5,000. The rest have simply vanished. Some 90% of the streets have been pulverised. The girls who were waving India flags at the parade have gone largely unmourned: their parents are also dead. \"I came to find my mother and father. They are somewhere under the rubble,\" Dinesh Shah said yesterday, picking through the debris. </p> <p>And yet amid this infernal carnage there is still scope for miracles: a young couple who were entombed for 50 hours after the quake were dug out alive yesterday from beneath a collapsed five-storey residential block. They were freed by army engineers who arrived only on Saturday evening. \"They were trapped in an air pocket so they survived. It was very dicey work but we chiselled them out,\" said an army major. \"They gave a sign saying: 'We are alive'. We made a hole and started talking. We passed them some water. They are in deep shock.\" </p> <p>Yesterday I watched as Kalpesh, the husband, dressed in a vest and a lunghi, staggered, Lazarus-like, out of his tomb. His wife, Rekha, still covered in dust, was carried out in tears. The rescuers applauded as they were led to an ambulance, together with a six-year-old boy who had, somehow, survived under the rubble for two days and two nights. But such moments are all too rare. </p> <p>Despite the fact that large-scale aid was finally rolling into Gujarat yesterday, the authorities' torpid response to the crisis has come too late. </p> <p>Instead, the living are merely exhuming and burning the dead. Bhachau market is now a medieval vision of nightmare: a circle of Dante's Hell. Volunteers from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu group, kept the pyres burning all day. There were too many corpses for ceremony: instead the dead were burnt where they were dug up. The town's alleyways were filled with black smoke. Fires smouldered with charred skulls and the sickly-sweet stench of burning flesh. </p> <p>\"In half a minute everybody was killed,\" Tusha Mehta, an aid worker newly arrived from Bombay, said. \"There have been more tremors today. This morning [Sunday] at 6.30am we felt another aftershock.\" He was right: as I climbed over a pile of debris soon after midday, the ground juddered again. Outside the market's temple, dozens of pairs of adult shoes are scattered amid the rubbish. Their owners lie crushed under 20ft of concrete. The way is strewn with fallen masonry, coconuts, sacks of rice, bangles, and mangled bicycles. At the school, the ponytail of a dead girl with an orange braid pokes out of the rubble. </p> <p>Fifty miles to the east in Bhuj, the historic town nearest to the earthquake's epicentre, the official responsible for managing the disaster painted a grim picture last night. \"We have 10 divisions. Five of them have been massively affected. Half a million people are homeless. The death toll is more than 20,000. In Bhuj alone we have already burned 1,000 corpses. There are an estimated 3,000 people under the debris,\" Bhuj's collector Kamal Bayani said. \"Our main activity now is removal of debris. We have 1,300 soldiers. In the next 24 hours we will have our power back.' </p> <p>His last forecast seemed hopelessly optimistic. Bhuj has no water or electricity, and there seems little prospect of its getting much of either for several weeks. There is little food, no petrol, and only a makeshift tent for a hospital set up in a park. </p> <p>While the devas tation is less severe than in Bhachau, most of Bhuj's old city has been destroyed, including the maharajah's 16th-century palace. At the Prince Hotel, where a couple of British tourists survived the quake, the manager Ajay Bora recalled what happened. \"We were preparing our bills when suddenly the floor started going doom doom doom,\" he said. </p> <p>At night the town is plunged into utter darkness. The stars seem glaringly bright. And the nights are cold - those who have survived the quake are camped outside their houses on makeshift beds. No one wants to go back inside. </p> <p>The exodus from Bhuj has already begun: by 6am the first people could be seen tramping through the bus station in the hope of escaping. Their prospects are improving: by afternoon all manner of vehicles were heading towards Bhuj, some transporting bulldozers others merely bringing second-hand jumpers. </p> <p>Further north, in the village of Lodai - the epicentre of the quake - villagers were attempting to rebuild their lives. Twenty three people were killed here. Most of the victims of the tragedy in Lodai, as elsewhere, were the elderly and the young unable to escape. \"My parents were killed over there,\" Shyamgi Rupa said, pointing to a heap of rubble. \"When the earthquake happened I looked after my wife and kids. Then I went to find my parents. </p> <p>\"After five hours I recovered my parents' bodies and put them on the fire.\" </p> <p><strong>Red Cross appeal</strong></p> <p>Call 08705 125125 or <a href=\"http://www.redcrossdonations.org.uk\">www.redcrossdonations.org.uk</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>As the death toll from the Indian earthquake continued its inexorable rise yesterday with more than 20,000 people feared dead, the sheer scale of the disaster appeared to be overwhelming the authorities. Despite the arrival of dozens of international rescue workers to help the 5,000 Indian troops hunting for survivors of the disaster, many remote villages had yet to be reached by rescue workers. </p> <p>With more than 500,000 people made homeless by the earthquake, the state government issued an urgent appeal for further shipments of food, shelter and medicines from the international community. </p> <p>The government in Delhi asked for $1.5bn (about \u00a31bn) from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to help in the reconstruction. </p> <p>Relief efforts have been hampered by continuing aftershocks measuring as high as 5.9 on the Richter scale, while damage to major roads has further delayed the distribution of much-needed supplies. Hospitals, many without power or water, have been overwhelmed by the number of injured, with more than 30,000 people requiring treatment in Bhuj alone, a town with a population of 150,000 near the epicentre of the quake. </p> <p>An Indian military source, after completing an aerial assessment of the surrounding area, described the situation as \"utter devastation\". </p> <p>With time running out for those trapped underneath the rubble, teams of rescue experts from abroad were only given the go-ahead to travel to the area on Saturday; the Japanese government said 35 rescuers trained to locate people trapped under debris were being held up by bureaucratic delays in India. </p> <p>Although earthquakes are a regular occurrence in a country that is prone to natural disasters, in the 24 hours following the earthquake - when the chance of finding survivors is highest - most of the rescue efforts were led by volunteers, frustrated by the lack of back-up and lifting equipment from the authorities. </p> <p>Yesterday, two days after the earthquake struck, the state authorities were still frantically looking for forklifts, cranes and metal-cutting equipment to reach trapped victims, while rescue workers and residents clawed through the rubble with sticks, iron rods and bare hands. </p> <p>A 69-strong team from the British International Rescue Corps finally arrived in Bhuj yesterday morning. It took the team 11 hours to make the journey from Ahmedabad to Bhuj, where they immediately set to work using thermal imaging cameras, listening equipment and mini-cameras to hunt for survivors in one of the estimated 80 high-rise blocks that had collapsed in the city. </p> <p>By last night the team had rescued three people from the rubble, including a seven-year-old boy and his mother. </p> <p>The government has ordered reinforcements for the 5,000 troops, and more heavy engineering equipment to the affected area. Teams, including sniffer dogs, from the UK, Canada, the Russian Federation, Germany, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Nations, had either arrived or were en route yesterday, while a French team was on standby at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. </p> <p>Even Pakistan, India's traditional enemy and itself hit by dozens of deaths, has offered relief aid to its neighbour. The chances of finding survivors, however, was diminishing by the hour last night. </p> <p>According to a spokeswoman for Rapid UK, which makes up the British deployment, along with UK Fire Service and civil defence personnel, finding anybody alive between 48 and 72 hours after an earthquake was akin to a miracle. </p> <p>\"The body can only last for so long without water.

      "bodyText": "As the death toll from the Indian earthquake continued its inexorable rise yesterday with more than 20,000 people feared dead, the sheer scale of the disaster appeared to be overwhelming the authorities. Despite the arrival of dozens of international rescue workers to help the 5,000 Indian troops hunting for survivors of the disaster, many remote villages had yet to be reached by rescue workers. With more than 500,000 people made homeless by the earthquake, the state government issued an urgent appeal for further shipments of food, shelter and medicines from the international community. The government in Delhi asked for $1.5bn (about \u00a31bn) from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to help in the reconstruction. Relief efforts have been hampered by continuing aftershocks measuring as high as 5.9 on the Richter scale, while damage to major roads has further delayed the distribution of much-needed supplies. Hospitals, many without power or water, have been overwhelmed by the number of injured, with more than 30,000 people requiring treatment in Bhuj alone, a town with a population of 150,000 near the epicentre of the quake. An Indian military source, after completing an aerial assessment of the surrounding area, described the situation as \"utter devastation\". With time running out for those trapped underneath the rubble, teams of rescue experts from abroad were only given the go-ahead to travel to the area on Saturday; the Japanese government said 35 rescuers trained to locate people trapped under debris were being held up by bureaucratic delays in India. Although earthquakes are a regular occurrence in a country that is prone to natural disasters, in the 24 hours following the earthquake - when the chance of finding survivors is highest - most of the rescue efforts were led by volunteers, frustrated by the lack of back-up and lifting equipment from the authorities. Yesterday, two days after the earthquake struck, the state authorities were still frantically looking for forklifts, cranes and metal-cutting equipment to reach trapped victims, while rescue workers and residents clawed through the rubble with sticks, iron rods and bare hands. A 69-strong team from the British International Rescue Corps finally arrived in Bhuj yesterday morning. It took the team 11 hours to make the journey from Ahmedabad to Bhuj, where they immediately set to work using thermal imaging cameras, listening equipment and mini-cameras to hunt for survivors in one of the estimated 80 high-rise blocks that had collapsed in the city. By last night the team had rescued three people from the rubble, including a seven-year-old boy and his mother. The government has ordered reinforcements for the 5,000 troops, and more heavy engineering equipment to the affected area. Teams, including sniffer dogs, from the UK, Canada, the Russian Federation, Germany, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Nations, had either arrived or were en route yesterday, while a French team was on standby at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. Even Pakistan, India's traditional enemy and itself hit by dozens of deaths, has offered relief aid to its neighbour. The chances of finding survivors, however, was diminishing by the hour last night. According to a spokeswoman for Rapid UK, which makes up the British deployment, along with UK Fire Service and civil defence personnel, finding anybody alive between 48 and 72 hours after an earthquake was akin to a miracle. \"The body can only last for so long without water. And while people have been pulled out alive after as long as 14 days, it is really very unusual to find anybody after 72 hours.\" The focus of the rescue operation will inevitably switch in the next 24 hours from trying to find the living to the grim but essential task of recovering the bodies of the dead.

      "body": "<p>For years I have written about the buying and selling of businesses, usually in that detached tone favoured by the financial community. A corporate figure (nearly always a man) is interviewed and boasts about his company and its acquisition. He talks about cutting overheads, making assets sweat - in other words, closing plants and sacking people. Or an analyst speaks knowingly about a business losing its focus on core activities. And I lap it up. </p> <p>Never, until recently, had I been at the other end of such cold reason. Only now can I appreciate what others have gone through. When quoted companies make a big move, they do so in the utmost secrecy. And this was the case with United News and Media (UNM), owner of Express Newspapers, publisher of the Sunday Express and Daily Express, of which I was deputy editor. </p> <p>Companies that take the stonewall approach fail to realise that senior staff are caught in the middle. You believe or suspect something is up, but don't know for sure. Meanwhile, junior colleagues believe that you know what's up and just aren't saying. For the uninformed senior executive, it is dispiriting and demoralising. You feel useless in a sphere where only days before you seemed to exercise total power. Suddenly, you are running an international news operation and are powerless to say for certain what is happening upstairs. The sale of Express Newspapers was on the cards as early as May 1999, but I learned only on November 22 2000 that the papers had been sold. We were not told by UNM. We learned the news from Sky News. </p> <p>Back in April 1998, I had left the job of deputy editor of the Independent with Rosie Boycott, the editor, to take up the task of turning round the Express titles. We were given a mandate to take the papers upmarket, to make them appeal to a younger, progressive audience. We were promised that the vast resources of UNM, a \u00a35bn corporation, would be at our disposal. There would be massive investment. We'd be able to draw on UNM's television and other media interests. </p> <p>All went well at first. We lost some older readers, wooed in part by promotional overtures from the Daily Mail, but that was predicted. (One commentator forecast we would lose 600,000 in six months; in fact, it was 150,000 in almost three years.) UNM, in the person of Lord Hollick, our new chief executive, took a close interest in the papers. Hollick, a big Labour supporter, was a regular at management meetings, where his enthusiasm could be infectious. Marketing plans, expansion and investment proposals were discussed. </p> <p>Then, in May 1999, the tap was abruptly turned off. With hindsight, it was the first sign of a shift in strategy that would ultimately lead to a sale. At the time, UNM's parsimony was attributed to the inherent character of Hollick, a shrewd dealmaker who was cautious by nature, not given to the sweeping visionary brushstrokes of media barons such as Rupert Murdoch and Lord Rothermere. </p> <p>Hollick hated to spend money. Unlike Murdoch and Rothermere, he was a salaryman, dependent on the goodwill of his external shareholders. </p> <p>Much was made in the press of Boycott's friendship with Hollick, but she never went to his house for dinner and he failed to attend work functions at her home. They would go for long periods without exchanging a word, and when they did it was often over a trivial complaint. Hollick's temper was fearsome; he was used to getting his own way and executives rarely stood up to him. </p> <p>Hollick, however, loved owning newspapers. They gave him political and social cachet. He adored ringing up political and football journalists for the latest gossip. If we had a cabinet minister in for lunch, Hollick expected to be invited. Yet he exhibited little interest in or feel for the living organism that a newspaper is - how it is put together, what makes it tick. </p> <p>His reluctance to spend money did not extend to paying for outside advice. UNM and its many parts were forever being pored over by consultants. It was one such study, I later discovered, that may have prompted the sudden change of policy in May 1999. Unknown to Boycott, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) had embarked on a crucial study of the Express group. Its sensitivity can be judged by the way it was cloaked in secrecy: in the detailed report that resulted, the project had the code-name Postbox; the Express titles were referred to as Unicorn and their sister publication, the Daily Star, was Comet. </p> <p>The study's conclusion was stark: although progress had been made, further development required investment that might be difficult to justify for a publicly listed company. For Hollick, who prided himself on doing right by shareholders, this was probably not what he wanted to read. The consultants were saying, in effect, that the Express group needed an owner-proprietor, rather than someone who always had to put shareholders' interests first. </p> <p>Rumours of the Express papers being on the block first surfaced in early summer of 1999, and the timing, given the date of the PwC report, cannot have been mere coincidence. Hollick's interest began to wane. The weekly meetings with him in the chair were scrapped, and when we did see him, the conversation dwelt on trivia. After Tony Blair's speech at the Labour party conference in Bournemouth in October 1999, I walked with Hollick to the High Cliff hotel. He said he was glad for the chance to chat. </p> <p>I thought that at last we might get an indication about future investment. It was not to be. He asked whether I thought he should go to see Barcelona play Arsenal in the Champions League. </p> <p>Industry gossip said Andrew Neil was hovering in the wings, ready to buy on behalf of the Barclay brothers. Pieces started appearing in rival newspapers predicting our disposal. One said City analysts were forecasting a \u00a31 rise in UNM's share price if the Express papers were sold. This gave a strong hint of the pressure Hollick faced. UNM shares at that time were barely above \u00a35. Market capitalisation was about \u00a33bn. The rumour mill said the papers would fetch, at most, \u00a3300m - yet here was the City saying we were worth \u00a3600m to the value of share price. This was always the argument we faced. City analysts thought we were more valuable to the company outside it than within it. </p> <p>UNM had a policy of not commenting on speculative stories. But amid this blizzard of publicity, that meant that assertions went unanswered and claims presented as fact were not denied. Internally, UNM assured us there was no truth in the rumours. Externally, the business and media pundits were having a ball. Staff assumed that the editor and deputy were in the loop. Sadly, nothing could have been further from the truth. We were not told; we were not consulted; we did not know. </p> <p>A lull ensued. The rumours died down and we resumed business as normal - except it was anything but normal. All the energy went into producing the paper day to day - it was as if the future did not exist. </p> <p>Journalists are quite unlike other workers. Their trade is information. They are trained observers who like nothing better than gossip. We had 440 pairs of eyes watching us and 440 pairs of ears hanging on every word. Any casual remark, joke or grimace by Boycott was relayed and dissected for any clue to imminent news. We debated whether she should tell staff: \"Look, I hear the rumours, too. But I assure you, I know nothing.\" But that was rejected because they would speculate that it was a double bluff. </p> <p>When we interviewed candidates for jobs, they would invariably ask what lay in store for the papers. Staff would come to us and say they had been approached by another paper. What could we advise? All we could answer was that we hadn't a clue. It was undermining - colleagues we knew and liked found it impossible to believe that a national newspaper editor who was so well informed on other matters and was a board director of the Express subsidiary did not know what the parent company was planning. Nor did her deputy. </p> <p>The mood changed again early last year. UNM was proposing to merge with Carlton. Two firms of consultants were appointed to examine the level of cash injection required to boost circulation. It was not much, but it was something. We found ourselves in meetings where the talk was of investment and growth. </p> <p>But just as abruptly, the mood changed. When it later became clear the merger was off, speculation again centred on the future of the newspapers and when UNM announced the sale of its television division to Granada, the writing was on the wall for the Express group. That's what the City thought, what all the media commentators wrote and what the staff believed. But UNM pretended nothing had changed. Hollick's ambition to become a major media player, with the bulk of ITV and other television interests, plus three national newspapers and several consumer magazines, had come to nought. We at the Express titles now found ourselves part of a company intent on a new direction. </p> <p>What political influence the papers afforded Hollick had vanished. Stories of the Labour peer's rage at the government, which he had loyally supported but which, as he saw it, had not assisted him, made the rounds of the building at Blackfriars. The papers' relationship with their boss had shifted. The feeling grew that he would sell us to any group - especially one opposed to Labour - just to spite the administration that had let him down so badly. </p> <p>At the paper, we explored the possibility of a management buyout and, with Boycott's approval, I met a City heavy-hitter. His reaction to the idea was swift: how would the Daily Express avoid the kind of grief the Independent had suffered when the Times started a price war? With no reserves, the Independent could not respond and its circulation fell. Finally, it had to give up its independence and turned to the Mirror Group for help. </p> <p>The buyout expert explained that the City prefers to back businesses that lead their markets. In other words, it hates taking risks - and, whichever way we cut it, we were a risk. He also said Hollick did not have a reputation for \"leaving something behind on the table\" so there was little likelihood that profits could be increased by making cuts - another thing the City likes. It was an eye-opener, one that left me applauding anyone brave enough to get involved in a buyout. </p> <p>Staff assumed, again, that we must have known what was going on. But Boycott had exchanged barely a word with Hollick in the three months before last October's Labour party conference in Brighton, when they had dinner together. I was there, along with other journalists and four government ministers. In the course of a three-hour meal, the subject of the papers never came up. </p> <p>What we could not have known was that there was an offer from the Barclay brothers which Hollick was sitting on. That fact emerged days later when the Guardian ran a story revealing that Andrew Neil had bid \u00a375m for Express Newspapers. Clearly, the Guardian had better lines of communication than we did. </p> <p>Express staff were up in arms. They wanted to know what was going on. We had to stand there like lemons and say we did not know. UNM kept a firm silence. Then there was the shock over the \u00a375m price. Surely we were worth more? Yes, but not much more. </p> <p>Even so, Neil's offer seemed absurdly low. The papers made a profit and had a total sale of some 2.5m. But, mad or not, UNM was saying nothing. The silence said it all: after months of debilitating prevarication and speculation, the papers were finally up for sale. The billionaire Hinduja brothers were interested. So was Mohamed Al Fayed. Another potential buyer was David Montgomery, former head of Mirror Group. </p> <p>Officially, UNM was still saying nothing, but news stories began appearing that seemed to carry the imprint of the parent company speaking off the record - in effect, inviting anyone to make a pitch. Internally, we were told zero. Over several weeks, our best sources as to what was going to happen to our business were the business pages. One week it was the Hinduja brothers, then Associated threw its hat into the ring, then Conrad Black's Hollinger Group. It was a strange feeling, coming into work and wondering whether that unfamiliar limousine parked outside might belong to a new suitor. </p> <p> And still no official word. At last, at the end of a management meeting, the human resources director said she had been told by UNM to suspend plans for a personnel initiative. The reason, she was informed, was that UNM felt that with all that was going on, it was not a priority. This, believe it or not, was the first time UNM had even indicated that anything might be going on. It was just one week before the sale of the papers was announced. </p> <p>As ever, we got our information from the other press. That week's Sunday Times delivered a new name: Richard Desmond, owner-proprietor of the Northern &amp; Shell magazine group. The next day's Financial Times carried a front-page story that Desmond was on the point of securing the newspapers. </p> <p>That Wednesday will live long in my memory. Another morning of silence from UNM, then at 1pm Sky proclaimed the sale of Express Newspapers as a breaking story. But still no confirmation. </p> <p>My mobile beeped at 2pm, while I was at the Savoy for the Spectator's Parliamentarian of the Year awards. It was my office: the papers had been sold. Northern &amp; Shell called an afternoon press conference. Boycott was summoned to see Hollick. For the first and only time, he explained to her why the papers had to go - terribly difficult, sorry and all that, hands tied... They said their farewells. Soon afterwards Desmond arrived to say hello. </p> <p>\u0095 Chris Blackhurst was deputy editor of the Daily Express until last Thursday when he and Rosie Boycott resigned. </p> <p>This article is taken from the February issue of Management Today, published on February 1, price \u00a33.50.

Unknown to Boycott, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) had embarked on a crucial study of the Express group. Its sensitivity can be judged by the way it was cloaked in secrecy: in the detailed report that resulted, the project had the code-name Postbox; the Express titles were referred to as Unicorn and their sister publication, the Daily Star, was Comet. The study's conclusion was stark: although progress had been made, further development required investment that might be difficult to justify for a publicly listed company. For Hollick, who prided himself on doing right by shareholders, this was probably not what he wanted to read. The consultants were saying, in effect, that the Express group needed an owner-proprietor, rather than someone who always had to put shareholders' interests first. Rumours of the Express papers being on the block first surfaced in early summer of 1999, and the timing, given the date of the PwC report, cannot have been mere coincidence. Hollick's interest began to wane. The weekly meetings with him in the chair were scrapped, and when we did see him, the conversation dwelt on trivia. After Tony Blair's speech at the Labour party conference in Bournemouth in October 1999, I walked with Hollick to the High Cliff hotel. He said he was glad for the chance to chat. I thought that at last we might get an indication about future investment. It was not to be. He asked whether I thought he should go to see Barcelona play Arsenal in the Champions League. Industry gossip said Andrew Neil was hovering in the wings, ready to buy on behalf of the Barclay brothers. Pieces started appearing in rival newspapers predicting our disposal. One said City analysts were forecasting a \u00a31 rise in UNM's share price if the Express papers were sold. This gave a strong hint of the pressure Hollick faced. UNM shares at that time were barely above \u00a35. Market capitalisation was about \u00a33bn. The rumour mill said the papers would fetch, at most, \u00a3300m - yet here was the City saying we were worth \u00a3600m to the value of share price. This was always the argument we faced. City analysts thought we were more valuable to the company outside it than within it. UNM had a policy of not commenting on speculative stories. But amid this blizzard of publicity, that meant that assertions went unanswered and claims presented as fact were not denied. Internally, UNM assured us there was no truth in the rumours. Externally, the business and media pundits were having a ball. Staff assumed that the editor and deputy were in the loop. Sadly, nothing could have been further from the truth. We were not told; we were not consulted; we did not know. A lull ensued. The rumours died down and we resumed business as normal - except it was anything but normal. All the energy went into producing the paper day to day - it was as if the future did not exist. Journalists are quite unlike other workers. Their trade is information. They are trained observers who like nothing better than gossip. We had 440 pairs of eyes watching us and 440 pairs of ears hanging on every word. Any casual remark, joke or grimace by Boycott was relayed and dissected for any clue to imminent news. We debated whether she should tell staff: \"Look, I hear the rumours, too. But I assure you, I know nothing.\" But that was rejected because they would speculate that it was a double bluff. When we interviewed candidates for jobs, they would invariably ask what lay in store for the papers. Staff would come to us and say they had been approached by another paper. What could we advise? All we could answer was that we hadn't a clue. It was undermining - colleagues we knew and liked found it impossible to believe that a national newspaper editor who was so well informed on other matters and was a board director of the Express subsidiary did not know what the parent company was planning. Nor did her deputy. The mood changed again early last year. UNM was proposing to merge with Carlton. Two firms of consultants were appointed to examine the level of cash injection required to boost circulation. It was not much, but it was something. We found ourselves in meetings where the talk was of investment and growth. But just as abruptly, the mood changed. When it later became clear the merger was off, speculation again centred on the future of the newspapers and when UNM announced the sale of its television division to Granada, the writing was on the wall for the Express group. That's what the City thought, what all the media commentators wrote and what the staff believed. But UNM pretended nothing had changed. Hollick's ambition to become a major media player, with the bulk of ITV and other television interests, plus three national newspapers and several consumer magazines, had come to nought. We at the Express titles now found ourselves part of a company intent on a new direction. What political influence the papers afforded Hollick had vanished. Stories of the Labour peer's rage at the government, which he had loyally supported but which, as he saw it, had not assisted him, made the rounds of the building at Blackfriars. The papers' relationship with their boss had shifted. The feeling grew that he would sell us to any group - especially one opposed to Labour - just to spite the administration that had let him down so badly. At the paper, we explored the possibility of a management buyout and, with Boycott's approval, I met a City heavy-hitter. His reaction to the idea was swift: how would the Daily Express avoid the kind of grief the Independent had suffered when the Times started a price war? With no reserves, the Independent could not respond and its circulation fell. Finally, it had to give up its independence and turned to the Mirror Group for help. The buyout expert explained that the City prefers to back businesses that lead their markets. In other words, it hates taking risks - and, whichever way we cut it, we were a risk. He also said Hollick did not have a reputation for \"leaving something behind on the table\" so there was little likelihood that profits could be increased by making cuts - another thing the City likes. It was an eye-opener, one that left me applauding anyone brave enough to get involved in a buyout. Staff assumed, again, that we must have known what was going on. But Boycott had exchanged barely a word with Hollick in the three months before last October's Labour party conference in Brighton, when they had dinner together. I was there, along with other journalists and four government ministers. In the course of a three-hour meal, the subject of the papers never came up. What we could not have known was that there was an offer from the Barclay brothers which Hollick was sitting on. That fact emerged days later when the Guardian ran a story revealing that Andrew Neil had bid \u00a375m for Express Newspapers. Clearly, the Guardian had better lines of communication than we did. Express staff were up in arms. They wanted to know what was going on. We had to stand there like lemons and say we did not know. UNM kept a firm silence. Then there was the shock over the \u00a375m price. Surely we were worth more? Yes, but not much more. Even so, Neil's offer seemed absurdly low. The papers made a profit and had a total sale of some 2.5m. But, mad or not, UNM was saying nothing. The silence said it all: after months of debilitating prevarication and speculation, the papers were finally up for sale. The billionaire Hinduja brothers were interested. So was Mohamed Al Fayed. Another potential buyer was David Montgomery, former head of Mirror Group. Officially, UNM was still saying nothing, but news stories began appearing that seemed to carry the imprint of the parent company speaking off the record - in effect, inviting anyone to make a pitch. Internally, we were told zero. Over several weeks, our best sources as to what was going to happen to our business were the business pages. One week it was the Hinduja brothers, then Associated threw its hat into the ring, then Conrad Black's Hollinger Group. It was a strange feeling, coming into work and wondering whether that unfamiliar limousine parked outside might belong to a new suitor. And still no official word. At last, at the end of a management meeting, the human resources director said she had been told by UNM to suspend plans for a personnel initiative. The reason, she was informed, was that UNM felt that with all that was going on, it was not a priority. This, believe it or not, was the first time UNM had even indicated that anything might be going on. It was just one week before the sale of the papers was announced. As ever, we got our information from the other press. That week's Sunday Times delivered a new name: Richard Desmond, owner-proprietor of the Northern &amp; Shell magazine group. The next day's Financial Times carried a front-page story that Desmond was on the point of securing the newspapers. That Wednesday will live long in my memory. Another morning of silence from UNM, then at 1pm Sky proclaimed the sale of Express Newspapers as a breaking story. But still no confirmation. My mobile beeped at 2pm, while I was at the Savoy for the Spectator's Parliamentarian of the Year awards. It was my office: the papers had been sold. Northern &amp; Shell called an afternoon press conference. Boycott was summoned to see Hollick. For the first and only time, he explained to her why the papers had to go - terribly difficult, sorry and all that, hands tied... They said their farewells. Soon afterwards Desmond arrived to say hello. \u0095 Chris Blackhurst was deputy editor of the Daily Express until last Thursday when he and Rosie Boycott resigned.

      "body": "<p>So far there have been two approaches to interactive television drama. The depressingly commercial route has been to view it as an unparalleled opportunity for integrated e-commerce within a mass market medium - the ability to click-and-buy the beer in John Goodman's hand in Roseanne, or that sofa in Friends. The other route is to see it as an unparalleled opportunity for new ideas that break the conven tional boundaries of narrative and authorship. </p> <p>The first, where most effort has been expended to date, is not going to get anyone excited (except ad men and women, retailers and a few network executives), which is why many people in the industry already find the medium a turn-off. The TV production community seems to be split into two camps: those who believe that dramatic narrative should be left to the experts - the rest of us are just there to be passively entertained - and those who passionately believe that audience participation is the future of drama. </p> <p>The Interactive Fictions conference, organised by scriptwriter Stephen Jeffery-Poulter with academic think-tank New Media Knowledge, was full of the latter faction. Students, media types and industry grey-hairs piled into a small theatre near the University of Westminster campus last Wednesday night to hear what pioneers of the medium had to say about how it works and what it is capable of. </p> <p>The first bit of bad news for those who are still struggling to get their heads round multi-channel TV is that interactive TV (iTV) has multiple potential platforms: not just digital cable, terrestrial, satellite and broadband ADSL, but games consoles, kiosks, supermarket intranets, not to mention on-the-move mechanisms. In other words, it is not just broadcasters but telcos, ISPs and even retail brands which are interested in getting into it. There is nothing new in commercially branded drama, however. After all, it was soap powder that funded the first \"soaps\" - radio serials. </p> <p>One of the drawbacks of the new medium is precisely that it has no constraints. Producers, traditionally bothered only by their budgets and pleasing the right people, now have to think of \"self-scheduling\" (users arbitrarily switching you off or on), non-linear and multi-layered plot lines subject to vagaries of viewer-voting (see that budget fly out of the window), personalisation (keeping tabs on the viewers' profile) and \"cross-genre\" developments (integrating chatrooms, email and phone). No wonder so many producers are despondent about iTV. </p> <p>Never before have the people behind the propaganda machine been so at the mercy of its audience. Simon Rose, founder of IMP corporation, aka Interacta (<a href=\"http://www.itsyourmovie.com\">www.itsyourmovie.com</a>), who made the \"world's first\" interactive movie Running Time, believes in \"democratic drama\", which gives the audience the power to influence the fates of the characters, actors and even the producers themselves. The thriller, devised in six-minute episodes, prompts the audience to vote on what happens next. For example, crisis point: there is an intruder in the flat. Should the heroine jump out of the window, open the door to people calling themselves \"the police\" or go off with the ruggedly handsome stranger? </p> <p>The production process Rose describes was hectic, however: the episode went live on a Thursday, the voting was processed over the weekend and on Monday the team of 10 would have to write the next day's script, find a location, shoot and then edit on Tuesday and Wednesday. It cost a tenth of the budget that Rose and his partner Simon Beaufoy, director of The Full Monty, were used to, but the crew often went without sleep. </p> <p>The producers found it was impossible to second-guess the audience. They had just secured a new actress (Valerie Grogan) when the audience killed off her character. When they supplied a salacious lesbian plotline, the prudish audience rejected it. A virtual boardroom was presented to get around the problem of discontinuity, so that the viewers could look back at the portfolio of the characters and read their email correspondence. Running Time got 6m visits in May while it was running. </p> <p>Rose points out that drama has only been linear since the 20th century. \"Storytelling used to be much more interactive, from the oral tradition through to Dickens, whose novel serialisations were influenced by the letters that people wrote him. The idea that there should just be one author is ridiculous.\" Like the early US film-makers, such as William Castle who sent electric shocks through the audience's seats, Rose wants to make drama a \"sit forward\" medium. </p> <p>Gub Neal, chairman of Vox TV and former head of drama at Granada and Channel 4, believes that \"democratic drama\" (of which Big Brother, being at once a docu-drama, internet experience and gameshow, was arguably the first successful example) has a bold new future. Thrillers and cop shows such as Cracker could work \"amazingly well in the medium [imagine a courtroom scenario], but there has to be a competitive element like betting or gaming in order to sustain the audience participation\". </p> <p>The second genre to have emerged is \"immersive\" or \"illusory drama\", where the viewer becomes voluntarily immersed in a virtual world. The best exponent of this is Online Caroline (<a href=\"http://www.onlinecaroline.com\">www.onlinecaroline.com</a>) , which appeared to be a window into the private world of a real twentysomething girl: \"Watch my webcam, read my emails, be my friend.\" Caroline even encourages you to give her advice on clothes and boys. If you respond, your relationship with her deepens and you \"share\" more information about yourself; if you don't reply to her emails, she gets stroppy. </p> <p>According to its co-creator Tom Harvey, MD of XPT, the audience seemed quite happy to \"suspend their disbelief and infiltrate her life as though it were real\". When two actors in black balaclavas appeared to be being burgling her flat, her answer phone was deluged with warning messages from concerned viewers. Two people even rang the police. The drama is still going strong. XPT claims an unheard-of 92% retention rate among the audience, and the chatroom is still buzzing. </p> <p>The BBC Fiction Lab's first experiment with \"immersive drama\" is to be aired later this year. Called The Block, it creates a virtual tower block environment set anywhere and nowhere, inhabited by virtual characters plus members of the audience, who can take a room in the block and join the community. The characters, scene-setting and \"house rules\" have been written by two young novelists- cum-techno-culture pundits, Jim Flint and Hari Kunzru, but ultimately it's the audience, as the narrative jury or fiction police, who decide what fate befalls their neighbours. If only it was this simple in life. </p> <p>The Lab is also exploring what they call \"multilevel drama\" in The Affair, devised by novelist Emily Perkins, which covers the breakdown of a relationship. The audience can navigate its way through a sequence of events which form the main storyline but at the same time can \"mine vertically\" through a scene to view it through the eyes of different characters and deepen their understanding (feel like you're missing something? Scroll back to find out what really happened behind the scenes at that party). </p> <p> Executive producer Richard Fell emphasises that the projects are still all experimental. \"We don't know what works yet or what shape they might end up taking,\" he concedes. But he believes that the medium, far from being banal, could put an end to couch-potatoism by \"drawing out the creativity of the audience\". He already envisages the \"Best of the Block\" as a conventional prime-time TV spin-off. </p> <p>Back to the conference, and panellists Rose, Harvey, Jeffery-Poulter and Jason Kingsley, founder of games publisher Rebellion and teenage inventor of the gamebook, all seem to be in agreement that interactive drama is heading towards the realm of voyeuristic, first-person computer games. Kingsley's description of the God-mimicking process of game authoring - \"to create a tool set for people to create their own form of entertainment; to say 'here's the environment, now play!'\" - seems a fairly good patent for the drama of the future. </p> <p>The greatest compliment games masters (or interactive scriptwriters for that matter) can be paid is for fans to write to them and say they are taking a \"virtual holiday\" inside their cod world, be it Alien Versus Predator, The Block or the fictional game based on Kronenberg's sci-fi classic Existenz. </p> <p>Perhaps XPT has got there already with its latest project, Mount Kristos. The interactive soap, scheduled for some time this year, allows you to go on holiday with 15 virtual characters and other users and get away with everything you can't do in real life.

      "body": "<p>On Friday Greg Dyke went to the corporation's equivalent of the lion's den, to assure Panorama journalists, led by new editor Mike Robinson, that BBC1 still loves them. He was inviting them to move on from last October's bitterness and gloom at being abruptly dumped on Sunday nights at 10.15pm, which some likened to being removed to die quietly in a hospital's side ward. </p> <p>Now with a reduced run of three ten-week blocks per year, Panorama will be judged in future by impact; the waves made by ambitious programmes such as last year's naming of the alleged Omagh bombers or the expos\u00e9 of the use of child labour by Gap and Nike. Impact will be more important than delivering BBC1-sized audiences to controller Lorraine Heggessey. </p> <p>You could call this new criterion a bit of a cop-out: the waves made by TV programmes are notoriously hard to measure, while Barb audience data is hard fact. And the later a programme's start time, the smaller the audience you can impact upon. Panorama audiences averaged 3.8m in 1999, dropping to 3.6m last autumn. Since the move, viewing figures have been more robust than expected, but still only average 3.3m. </p> <p>Meanwhile, as Dyke met the troops, celebrations were under way at ITV's populist current affairs strand, Tonight with Trevor McDonald. Pushed back from its 10pm slot to 10.20pm last Thursday because of the restored news, it drew an average 4.8m, 32% of the available audience, thanks to an interview with actor and ex-cocaine addict Danniella Westbrook and items on DNA paternity testing and the burial of Mary, the doomed conjoined twin. </p> <p>Like Panorama, Tonight has a new editor: David Mannion, 50, a combative former editor of ITV news at ITN: \"I'd like, in a year, to convince ITV to run Tonight twice a week,\" he says, \"to make the programme so successful that it's good business to have more current affairs. Current affairs is on the way back, it's being raised from the near dead.

Richard Lindley, a former Panorama reporter who is writing a book marking its fiftieth anniversary in 2003, says: \"I feel more cheerful about Panorama's survival now than I did before Christmas.\" </p> <p>The optimism partly stems from the appointment of Robinson, 44, a universally respected BBC producer of 20 years' standing, a winner of five top industry awards with experience spanning documentaries and editorship of the One O'Clock News. He worked with Martin Bashir (now Tonight's star journalist) on Panorama's biggest coup, Princess Diana's \"there are three people in this marriage\" interview, and is determinedly upbeat: \"Look at the successes, the number of programmes which have had an impact.

      "bodyText": "On Friday Greg Dyke went to the corporation's equivalent of the lion's den, to assure Panorama journalists, led by new editor Mike Robinson, that BBC1 still loves them. He was inviting them to move on from last October's bitterness and gloom at being abruptly dumped on Sunday nights at 10.15pm, which some likened to being removed to die quietly in a hospital's side ward. Now with a reduced run of three ten-week blocks per year, Panorama will be judged in future by impact; the waves made by ambitious programmes such as last year's naming of the alleged Omagh bombers or the expos\u00e9 of the use of child labour by Gap and Nike. Impact will be more important than delivering BBC1-sized audiences to controller Lorraine Heggessey. You could call this new criterion a bit of a cop-out: the waves made by TV programmes are notoriously hard to measure, while Barb audience data is hard fact. And the later a programme's start time, the smaller the audience you can impact upon. Panorama audiences averaged 3.8m in 1999, dropping to 3.6m last autumn. Since the move, viewing figures have been more robust than expected, but still only average 3.3m. Meanwhile, as Dyke met the troops, celebrations were under way at ITV's populist current affairs strand, Tonight with Trevor McDonald. Pushed back from its 10pm slot to 10.20pm last Thursday because of the restored news, it drew an average 4.8m, 32% of the available audience, thanks to an interview with actor and ex-cocaine addict Danniella Westbrook and items on DNA paternity testing and the burial of Mary, the doomed conjoined twin. Like Panorama, Tonight has a new editor: David Mannion, 50, a combative former editor of ITV news at ITN: \"I'd like, in a year, to convince ITV to run Tonight twice a week,\" he says, \"to make the programme so successful that it's good business to have more current affairs. Current affairs is on the way back, it's being raised from the near dead. People were making programmes for their peer group, for the chattering classes, and lost touch with the audience.\" His optimism is echoed elsewhere.

As the director in charge of media strategy at Camelot, I had one thorn in my flesh - Sir Richard Branson. </p> <p>This was never because I felt that the People's Lottery merited to win the lottery licence, but because of Branson's obvious gift at handling the media. I had faith in the Camelot bid, but knew that whereas the media was obviously never going to win us the licence, there was a danger of it losing it for us. Fat cats versus national hero - this was always going to be one of the greatest communication challenges ever. </p> <p>With such a skilled communicator as our adversary, our media strategy initially was twofold: to concentrate on the running of a world-class lottery and to ignore the competition. We set about collecting the badges: the world's most efficient lottery; the ISO 9001 award for quality; leading corporate donor; a far-reaching social and ethical audit... and so the list went on. Not, of course, headline stuff, but our proven track record provided a powerful contrast to a consortium with no experience of running the UK national lottery. </p> <p>The decision publicly to ignore the competition was daring, and at times intensely frustrating for Camelot's 800 staff. There seemed little point, however, in strengthening our competition's publicity agenda and so we firmly stuck to defending and promoting our own strong position. </p> <p>By August last year, we may not have won the hearts of the nation - most polls still showed the People's Lottery as the popular favourite - but we had won the rational argument among most media opinion-formers. In stark contrast to the fat-cat days, there was no strong tabloid hostility to us. The media generally seemed prepared to accept a possible Camelot victory without making it a major national issue. </p> <p>Curiously enough, we have Dame Helena Shovelton to thank for helping us achieve the final turnaround in media support. Her \"conspicuously unfair decision\" in August, to exclude Camelot from the race, gave a new twist to the media campaign. For a start, the fact that we so very nearly lost perversely acted in our favour. Suddenly glowing Camelot epitaphs started to be drafted by journalists. I sensed a certain amount of guilt among some of the media who had criticised us so hard - was Camelot really that bad that it deserved to be kicked out so unfairly? Would the new operator really live up to all the promises made? </p> <p>Two key strokes of fortune came our way. The first was that the unthinkable happened: a new \"villain\" entered the lottery saga and Camelot now had the opportunity to be seen as the victim of a blatantly unfair process. </p> <p> W ith a damning court judgment and the media hungry for fair play, this opportunity was relatively easy to exploit. It required, however, a complete change of approach at Camelot. For the first time, the company very publicly started attacking its regulator. Our strong and gutsy attack took some people by surprise. For many of us at Camelot it was a liberating experience: we had nothing to lose and strongly believed that we had been sorely cheated. There was a roar of approval throughout our offices in Watford when the decision was announced to take the commission to court. For once, the company was seen by staff to be robustly standing up for itself. </p> <p>The second opportunity was to promote to the full one of our best assets - a \"feisty, 5ft nothing blonde\" with, in her own words, \"balls of steel\". Overnight, Camelot's new chief executive, Dianne Thompson, became the people's champion for fair play. At first reluctant to become a media star, she was a natural and quickly rose to the challenge. Although the fight was clearly with our regulator, we were able to use it to question the competition. Suddenly, we relished face to face interviews with the People's Lottery. Here was a woman who struck a chord with the nation and who was a sound, articulate advocate of a well-run organisation. </p> <p>Ironically, we now had two ingredients which were in many ways more \"Bransonesque\" than Camelot. Against the odds we had become the underdog and in so doing won widespread public sympathy. Second, we suddenly gained public popularity with a strong individual personality who provided a clear contrast to the past fat-cat image of Camelot. </p> <p>At the end of the day, however, it was the soundness and quality of the Camelot bid rather than the media that won the licence for us. That, of course, is how it should be and all we ever wanted. I would, though, be the first to admit that the strong media interest in Camelot has been an important driving force behind some of the changes and improvements made to the company over the years. For that we owe thanks to Branson. </p> <p>On the day that the People's Lottery announced that it would not continue with the fight, Branson sent a fax to Thompson congratulating her on Camelot's success and wishing all the staff well. It was a generous gesture. Hopefully, Camelot can now move on and develop its exciting and radical plans for the second licence term in a more supportive, but still questioning, media climate. </p> <p>In the end, only time will tell. The National Lottery has graced our front pages for far too long to escape future controversies.

      "body": "<p>The season of the rich is upon us, the rich-list season that is. The most expensive editorial projects of the year, the annual counts of the richest people in the country, are huge circulation boosts for the Sunday papers. </p> <p>Both the Sunday Times and the Mail on Sunday have spent more than \u00a31m on their chronicles of those who own the most this year. First out of the trap was the Mail, which bolted last week - more than six weeks ahead of its more established rival. The Mail's prize was an early slice of the extra sales that a peek at how the other half lives can bring. According to Dr Phil Beresford, rich list editor of the Sunday Times, sales of the paper go up by 14% on rich list day. </p> <p>Beresford thinks it is this rise that prompted the Mail on Sunday into action. Last year was the Mail's first survey of the 300 richest people in the UK. Despite a promotions budget of more than \u00a3700,000 and a research budget of \u00a3265,000, the first list was tentative, played it safe and included few entrants who were not also on the Sunday Times's list. The reward was a tantalising 2.3% rise in circulation, about 50,000 copies. </p> <p>This year the rise was almost 5%, and this time the Mail did what it does best. It told stories of the wealthy instead of listing their loot and used plenty of pictures. The result was a bright, hugely readable colour supplement. Rachel Oldroyd, compiler of the rich report, reckons that the paper has hit its stride. </p> <p>\"We try to tell the story of these people both in words and pictures, and not just provide a list of financial figures. The huge response from readers and from people portrayed in it suggests we have the balance right.\" </p> <p>But who likes rich lists? Beresford muses that \"people have always been fascinated by their betters, whether financially or socially. Once upon a time it was royalty and the aristocracy. Now it's the rich, who are the modern aristocracy.\" </p> <p>His role in rich lists began in Claridge's at lunch with the late Tiny Rowland, buccaneering head of Lonrho, and the Telegraph's city editor, Ivan Fallon. As Beresford tells it, Rowland asked Fallon why he didn't do a UK rich list \"like the American one in Forbes\". Fallon thought it a great idea, rushed back to the paper and got his team onto it right away. </p> <p>Two weeks into the research, after a couple of dukes had been phoned and asked to put a price tag on their ancient art and acres, Lord Hartwell, the then proprietor of the Telegraph, got an irate call from one of the same dukes, advising him that if he (His Grace, the Duke of Atholl) appeared in a rich list,Hartwell could forget shooting \"grice\" across the duke's 147,000 Scottish acres. The Sainsbury family rang Scotland Yard. The Duke of Devonshire told the Sunday Telegraph editor, John Thompson, at the bar in White's club that: \"That is not the done thing in the Sunday Telegraph.\" The year was 1982 and there ended the first UK rich list, destroyed by the dukes. </p> <p>By 1988, however, Fallon was deputy editor of the Sunday Times and Beresford was industry editor. That year, the original Money magazine had a stab at the 200 richest people in the UK. That was enough for the Sunday Times duo. In circumstances of the utmost secrecy, marooned on an island between business news and the sports section, Beresford and a small team put all their expertise into a definitive list of the UK rich. </p> <p>No one was phoned. The research was entirely desk-based, arm's-length. The first the entrants knew of their elevation to wealth stardom was when they bought the paper on April 2 1989. Indeed, so tight had been the security that that was also the day that 99% of the Sunday Times staff found out that the paper had a rich list. Sales rose by 14%. The rich list was there to stay, and it has grown from 200 entrants to 1,000. </p> <p>Neither Beresford, nor his proprietors, will admit the true scale of spending on the ST list, but it is known that the first year research alone cost about \u00a3165,000, a sum about which the late Tony Bambridge, managing editor of the ST, was heard to remark, \"If we'd know what it cost we'd never have done it\". </p> <p>The first version of any rich list is the most expensive, as the Mail has found - now focused on a combination of research and photography, with an annual spend of around \u00a31m, about \u00a3750,000 of which goes on production and marketing. Sunday Times costs are probably in the same region. </p> <p>There are no real rivals to the two heavyweights. The Observer produces an eclectic and intimate list of the young rich, but has found itself sandwiched between the multimillion-pound promotional budgets of the MoS and the ST. And what about the wealthy? How do they like being on a rich list? The late steel tycoon Jack Walker described the first Sunday Times rich list as \"a beggars' and burglars' charter\".

      "bodyText": "The season of the rich is upon us, the rich-list season that is. The most expensive editorial projects of the year, the annual counts of the richest people in the country, are huge circulation boosts for the Sunday papers. Both the Sunday Times and the Mail on Sunday have spent more than \u00a31m on their chronicles of those who own the most this year. First out of the trap was the Mail, which bolted last week - more than six weeks ahead of its more established rival. The Mail's prize was an early slice of the extra sales that a peek at how the other half lives can bring. According to Dr Phil Beresford, rich list editor of the Sunday Times, sales of the paper go up by 14% on rich list day. Beresford thinks it is this rise that prompted the Mail on Sunday into action. Last year was the Mail's first survey of the 300 richest people in the UK. Despite a promotions budget of more than \u00a3700,000 and a research budget of \u00a3265,000, the first list was tentative, played it safe and included few entrants who were not also on the Sunday Times's list. The reward was a tantalising 2.3% rise in circulation, about 50,000 copies. This year the rise was almost 5%, and this time the Mail did what it does best. It told stories of the wealthy instead of listing their loot and used plenty of pictures. The result was a bright, hugely readable colour supplement. Rachel Oldroyd, compiler of the rich report, reckons that the paper has hit its stride. \"We try to tell the story of these people both in words and pictures, and not just provide a list of financial figures. The huge response from readers and from people portrayed in it suggests we have the balance right.\" But who likes rich lists? Beresford muses that \"people have always been fascinated by their betters, whether financially or socially. Once upon a time it was royalty and the aristocracy. Now it's the rich, who are the modern aristocracy.\" His role in rich lists began in Claridge's at lunch with the late Tiny Rowland, buccaneering head of Lonrho, and the Telegraph's city editor, Ivan Fallon. As Beresford tells it, Rowland asked Fallon why he didn't do a UK rich list \"like the American one in Forbes\". Fallon thought it a great idea, rushed back to the paper and got his team onto it right away. Two weeks into the research, after a couple of dukes had been phoned and asked to put a price tag on their ancient art and acres, Lord Hartwell, the then proprietor of the Telegraph, got an irate call from one of the same dukes, advising him that if he (His Grace, the Duke of Atholl) appeared in a rich list,Hartwell could forget shooting \"grice\" across the duke's 147,000 Scottish acres. The Sainsbury family rang Scotland Yard. The Duke of Devonshire told the Sunday Telegraph editor, John Thompson, at the bar in White's club that: \"That is not the done thing in the Sunday Telegraph.\" The year was 1982 and there ended the first UK rich list, destroyed by the dukes. By 1988, however, Fallon was deputy editor of the Sunday Times and Beresford was industry editor. That year, the original Money magazine had a stab at the 200 richest people in the UK. That was enough for the Sunday Times duo. In circumstances of the utmost secrecy, marooned on an island between business news and the sports section, Beresford and a small team put all their expertise into a definitive list of the UK rich. No one was phoned. The research was entirely desk-based, arm's-length. The first the entrants knew of their elevation to wealth stardom was when they bought the paper on April 2 1989. Indeed, so tight had been the security that that was also the day that 99% of the Sunday Times staff found out that the paper had a rich list. Sales rose by 14%. The rich list was there to stay, and it has grown from 200 entrants to 1,000. Neither Beresford, nor his proprietors, will admit the true scale of spending on the ST list, but it is known that the first year research alone cost about \u00a3165,000, a sum about which the late Tony Bambridge, managing editor of the ST, was heard to remark, \"If we'd know what it cost we'd never have done it\". The first version of any rich list is the most expensive, as the Mail has found - now focused on a combination of research and photography, with an annual spend of around \u00a31m, about \u00a3750,000 of which goes on production and marketing. Sunday Times costs are probably in the same region. There are no real rivals to the two heavyweights. The Observer produces an eclectic and intimate list of the young rich, but has found itself sandwiched between the multimillion-pound promotional budgets of the MoS and the ST. And what about the wealthy? How do they like being on a rich list? The late steel tycoon Jack Walker described the first Sunday Times rich list as \"a beggars' and burglars' charter\". Peter de Savary, currently working his way back into the list after the recession of the 90s, was wont to make phone calls beginning, \"Hi number 65, this is number 44 here\". David Sullivan, the porn baron, wrote an irate letter to the Sunday Times, enclosing his accounts and pension fund and declaring himself grossly undervalued in 1990 at \u00a360m. In 1991 he was better pleased at \u00a3100m, and the MoS now makes him worth \u00a3400m. Perhaps the greatest moment for the rich lists came in 1993, when the Queen was finally forced to pay tax after years of appearing at the head of the list as a billionairess. The price of success was years of pressure from the Palace to reduce her estimated wealth, on the grounds that most of her assets belong to the state. Last year, she was worth a mere \u00a3270m, while the M0S placed her at \u00a3480m. The two rival compilers both have some claim to be producing a work of academic scholarship. Whether or not the rich list can truly be seen as such, the multimillion pound rivalry between the two former historians will continue well beyond the publication in April of the Sunday Times rich list 2001. \u0095 Kevin Cahill is editor of the Eurobusiness Richest 400 Europeans, and Eurobusiness Richest 200 Women in the World.

The most deft answer of the day came when the environment minister, Michael Meacher, standing in for the former Northern Ireland secretary, was asked: \"Are you glad to see the back of Peter Mandelson?\" He replied: \"Only in the sense that it allows me to be here today.\"",

A multimillion pound campaign launching this spring will present Eurostar as a pleasurable experience that allows the traveller time to sit back and think. Eurostar's ad agency, TBWA, has approached a number of \"offbeat\" celebrities, including actors, singers and sports stars, for the campaign, which uses the endline \"Enjoy your journey\". One of the main aims of the new advertising drive is to persuade more business travellers to opt for Eurostar. It will be presented as the hassle-free alternative to travelling by plane. Eurostar already claims to have a 63% share of the London to Paris rail and air travel market. Eurostar has had little consistency to its advertising since it launched in 1994. A quirky campaign fronted by French comedian Antoine de Caunes and a philosophising Eric Cantona was followed by a campaign that showed scenes of Paris with the line, \"As if by magic Paris arrived\". More recent TV advertising has featured a group of visitors to Paris and Brussels breaking into song in French. Eurostar appointed TBWA to handle its European advertising account last November in order to develop a more consistent message for the brand. Previously, Eurostar's advertising had been handled by Young &amp; Rubicam in France and Belgium and by St Luke's in the UK.",

The fight against political correctness no longer has the same streak of creative rebellion - with champions like Richard Littlejohn and Chris Evans, who needs enemies? And the Godfather, Brown himself, grew up and got married. \"IPC appointing an editor to take it on is a bit like having a follow-up to Pulp Fiction that's not directed by Quentin Tarantino,\" says Brown. Immodesty aside, he may have a point.",

      "body": "<p>This is a tale of good old-fashioned reporting, an underplayed story and a slow-burning fuse. The Observer got wind of something to do with Peter Mandelson, the Hindujas and passports back in November. Their public policy editor, Antony Barnett, contacted the Liberal Democrat MP, Norman Baker, who put down questions in the House of Commons. </p> <p>On Thursday night, January 18, Gaby Hinsliff, the paper's chief political correspondent, did what lobby reporters often fail to do, and scoured the trays in the lower press gallery for written answers. There she found Home Office replies to Baker's questions. Even the MP himself hadn't realised they were there. She alerted Barnett, they put together a story, paged Mandelson and then his adviser on Saturday lunchtime, and the rest, as they say, is history. </p> <p>Hindsight may be a wonderful thing, and most people agree that it was Mandelson's response to the story, more than the facts within it, that led to his immolation. But one question on the minds of old hands in the lobby and at the Observer last week was why the story was put only at the basement of the front page? There was no follow-up inside and no leader article. Some of the other Sunday papers, following it up for later editions, gave it greater prominence. And the Mail on Sunday even changed its lead story. </p> <p>On Sunday, broadcasters made some reference, but it still wasn't considered particularly hot news. The papers made calls, were given a similar line from Downing Street, and the coverage on Monday was straightforward. The Times gave it two-paragraph treatment on page one. The rest put it inside. Two papers wrote leaders. The Daily Mail warned Mandelson to \"ensure this latest embarrassment is his last\". But that was as far as it went. The Sun was the first really to sniff (or cause) trouble, proclaiming Mandelson was \"not fit to be foreign secretary, a job he covets\". In general, the inauguration of George W Bush, the vote on cloning and the bail-out for Huntingdon Life Sciences were deemed more important. </p> <p>Tuesday's papers relegated the story even further back. But all this changed later that morning when Alastair Campbell had to explain that Mandelson had \"forgotten\" making that ill-fated phone call about the passport. The lobby, which hadn't had a meaty story for some time, went into overdrive. Pages were set aside. </p> <p>Wednesday made for unpleasant reading for the government but, tellingly, Fleet Street couched its righteous indignation in careful tones. The broadsheets, as is their wont, trod delicately. The Times said Mandelson had compounded the problem with his evasiveness; the Telegraph said the public was \"bound to take an unsympathetic view\" of his latest lapse. In the Independent, Anne McElvoy said Blair's loyalty to his friend had been subjected to more than its \"fair share of wear and tear\". The tabloids went in hard, calling Mandelson a liability, and wondering how many more lies could be tolerated. The Sun repeated its not-for-foreign-secretary line of Monday, suggesting giving him that post would be \"like putting Bruce Grobbelaar in charge of football\". Intriguingly, it was only the Express that stuck its neck out, calling on Blair to sack him from the cabinet, but perhaps only after the election. </p> <p>So this was quite different to Mandelson Downfall Part One. Then it was a reading of the morning's papers, especially the Sun, that persuaded Blair to remove him. This time, it was Mandelson's tall story to Campbell himself that did it. Even though the papers heaped opprobrium on Mandelson on Thursday, and then stepped up the pressure on Keith Vaz and the government in general on Friday, one Downing Street adviser put it ruefully: \"For once, we couldn't blame the press.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Two weeks ago, I said it was the Times that had broken the story that Harold Shipman may have killed up to 300 patients. In fact it first appeared as the splash in the Independent on Sunday on New Year's Eve. Apologies to the indomitable Colin Brown. It goes to show that some stories aren't followed up properly, while others are buried by their own papers. That's luck for you. </p> <p><strong> On that fateful morning, who said what about Peter Mandelson?</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Sack him:</strong> Express </p> <p><strong> Never Foreign Secretary:</strong> Sun </p> <p><strong> Negative, but no recommendation:</strong> Mirror, Mail, Telegraph, Times </p> <p><strong> No leaders:</strong> Guardian, Independent, Financial Times</p>",

      "bodyText": "Former Express deputy editor Chris Blackhurst has revealed that a critical study of the Express by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 1999 lead to an \"abrupt\" loss of interest by the then proprietor, Lord Hollick. Mr Blackhurst talks about the alienation felt by himself and editor Rosie Boycott, who were kept in the dark throughout the long and protracted sale process. In a swingeing attack in today's MediaGuardian, Mr Blackhurst paints a picture of the Express's former owner, Lord Hollick, as an absentee proprietor who wanted a share in the paper's glory without the investment and nurturing required. Mr Blackhurst notes that after Lord Hollick bought the newspaper in 1999, there was an initial surge of interest, followed by a period of purdah. At first he said the new owner kept a keen interest. \"Hollick, a big Labour supporter, was a regular at management meetings, where his enthusiasm could be infectious. Marketing plans, expansion and investment proposals were discussed,\" he said. \"Then in May 1999 the tap was abruptly turned off. With hindsight, it was the first sign of a shift in strategy that would ultimately lead to a sale.\" The report by PricewaterhouseCoopers suggested that the papers needed an owner-proprietor \"rather than someone who always had to put shareholders first\". It was this conclusion which, Mr Blackhurst believes, precipitated the eventual sale of the papers to Northern &amp; Shell at the end of last year. Mr Blackhurst also tells of Lord Hollick's \"parsimony\", saying he liked the glamour of being involved with running a newspaper but did not relish the involvement. \"He adored ringing up political and football journalists for the latest gossip.

A favourite among cash-strapped students and anyone who likes brightly coloured sweaters. </p> <p><strong> So what's the problem?</strong></p> <p> Oliviero Toscani, the brains behind Benetton's campaigns and advertising's very own shock-jock, unexpectedly quit last year after creating a furore that proved too much even for Benetton. An advertising campaign that featured Death Row convicts caused one controversy too many. </p> <p><strong> And what is it doing about it?</strong> </p> <p>Benetton's latest ad campaign delivered the ultimate shock by featuring - you've guessed it - clothes. Gone are the \"provocative\" images of newborn babies and copulating horses. In their place we get smiling models in brightly coloured clothes. \"We are not speaking to the world this time, we are speaking to women,\" says chief Benetton spokesman Federico Sartor enigmatically. </p> <p><strong> Marketing:</strong></p> <p> Benetton has taken the unusual step of handing the company's advertising to a group of arts students. Pupils of the Benetton-funded Fabrica arts institute have been asked to come up with ideas on how to promote the world-famous brand. </p> <p><strong> History:</strong> </p> <p>Chairman Luciano Benetton got into the rag trade in the 1970s, after friends admired the jumpers his sister had knitted for him. The 65-year-old entrepreneur is still going strong with plans for a chain of Benetton megastores in major cities across the world.

      "bodyText": "What is it? The high-street clothes shop whose woollies were made famous by its pictures of snogging priests, dying Aids patients and giant condoms. A favourite among cash-strapped students and anyone who likes brightly coloured sweaters. So what's the problem? Oliviero Toscani, the brains behind Benetton's campaigns and advertising's very own shock-jock, unexpectedly quit last year after creating a furore that proved too much even for Benetton. An advertising campaign that featured Death Row convicts caused one controversy too many. And what is it doing about it? Benetton's latest ad campaign delivered the ultimate shock by featuring - you've guessed it - clothes. Gone are the \"provocative\" images of newborn babies and copulating horses. In their place we get smiling models in brightly coloured clothes. \"We are not speaking to the world this time, we are speaking to women,\" says chief Benetton spokesman Federico Sartor enigmatically. Marketing: Benetton has taken the unusual step of handing the company's advertising to a group of arts students. Pupils of the Benetton-funded Fabrica arts institute have been asked to come up with ideas on how to promote the world-famous brand. History: Chairman Luciano Benetton got into the rag trade in the 1970s, after friends admired the jumpers his sister had knitted for him. The 65-year-old entrepreneur is still going strong with plans for a chain of Benetton megastores in major cities across the world. The company's new, cleaned-up advertising is being seen as more appropriate for its more corporate approach. What about the competition? Industry observers have pointed out the remarkable similarity of Benetton's latest campaign to The Gap's ads. Come to mention it, those fresh-faced, multicultural young things dancing around in brightly coloured clothes do seem a little familiar...",

The 20th century saw both a historically unprecedented rate of urbanisation of the world's population and the terrible vulnerability of human life, when accumulated in such concentrations, to natural or manmade disaster. Human beings have spent the last century building, destroying and rebuilding cities. One of the second world war's most pernicious legacies was to turn the city into modern warfare's main battleground: Dresden, Hiroshima, Leningrad, London's blitz. More recently, it has been Grozny, Belgrade, Sarajevo and Baghdad. </p> <p>By 2007, more people will live in cities and towns than in the countryside. For the first time in history, human experience will be predominantly urban rather than rural. This shift has been accomplished in the west over the course of 200-odd years, but in developing countries it has taken less than half that. In 1950, Africa's urban population accounted for 15%, Asia's 17%; in 2000 it was 38% and 37% respectively and by 2030 it will be 53% and 55%. The life that revolved around the village, the agricultural seasons and a relationship to nature has been replaced by the shanty town, street-selling, schools and a global consumer culture. This massive social transformation is dislocating billions of people's sense of place, belonging and identity within three or four generations. </p> <p>So, it is with characteristic surefootedness that the Tate Modern has chosen cities for its first major exhibition, which opens this week. If anyone is to begin to make sense of an urbanised world, Century City is a good starting place; it focuses on distinct periods of cultural creativity in nine cities through the 20th century, from Paris and Vienna to Lagos, Tokyo and finally, Bombay/Mumbai and London in the 90s. </p> <p>In the foreword to the catalogue, Century City is described as a mission statement for the Tate Modern's future exhibitions programme: picking a theme and exploring it across time, across the globe and across the traditional demarcations, from film and music to visual arts. Some will complain of a global urban buffet, which jumbles up Schiele with Mumbai artist Atul Dodiya's painting on shopfront shutters. </p> <p>But the search here is for the new connections we need to understand experiences common to all cities. For example, pre-first world war Vienna and 90s Mumbai are in many ways worlds apart but both cities share experiences of rapid growth, chronic housing shortages and struggles with ethnic conflict and national identity. In both, an individualistic introspection and sexual assertion comes into conflict with traditional social conventions. </p> <p>Mumbai is an appropriate city for the exhibition to end on, because it represents the future. Along with Tokyo, Mexico City and Sao Paulo, it is a megalopolis of more than 20m inhabitants; by 2015 it is predicted to become the second biggest in the world with a population of 26m. Shockingly, as Ashish Rajadhyaksha, one of the curators for the Mumbai section, points out, 50% of the population lives in shanty towns or on the streets and by 2010 that could be as high as 90%. Rajadhyaksha adds that such cities become almost impossible to live in; people can't move for traffic congestion, and they can't breathe, the air is so polluted. The scale of such cities present an awesome challenge to politicians to manage and deliver the public goods - such as transport and sanitation - on which the city depends. </p> <p>And that task is immeasurably complicated by the process of globalisation that Rajadhyaksha ascribes as the key theme: \"The city splits into two experiences - the globalised metropolis of shopping malls, high-rise buildings, a security-conscious elite - and the nativisit, indigenous, anti-English language street level.\" He believes the conflict between the two has moved from economy where the global has triumphed - \"You can't be anti-global if you want to be rich\" - to culture and politics, fuelling at its worst, ethnic fundamentalism. </p> <p>Rajadhyaksha fears that in the polarising inequality, what has been lost is a safe public sphere in the city. You can no longer assume safety as a public good provided by the state, you have to buy your own through bodyguards, security gates and several locks on doors. Security is the biggest growth industry in the world. </p> <p>All of this is exactly what London needs to be thinking about. British cities have been blighted by the governing classes' rural nostalgia; they're dreaming of escape to a country idyll - which is why the M4 was one of England's first motorways. Nationalism was defined in the 20th century as honey for tea and cricket on the village green, while cities were associated with Blake's \"dark satanic mills\" and the taint of industry and commerce. </p> <p>The reality, as Lord Rogers pointed out in the foreword to his urban task force report, is that urban areas account for 90% of the UK population and 91% of economic output. Rogers adds that the neglect of our cities by policymakers is borne out by the survey in which one in four people believe their urban neighbourhoods have got worse. What the British have chosen to overlook is that great cultural creativity almost invariably takes place in cities and that (at their best) cities nurture civic participation and citizenship. </p> <p>Only in the past few years, after nearly 30 years of neglect, have we begun to think and debate a vision of what our cities should be like, and as Rogers points out, it will take decades to repair the damage. In the 70s the state withdrew, and the market exploited the vacuum, to the impoverishment of public space. A sense of what we've lost and need to revive is evident in Ken Worpole's Here Comes The Sun, a fascinating account of the political idealism that informed urban planning for the first two-thirds of the 20th century. It is full of insight into how public space influences such things as a sense of belonging and of ownership - themes that crop up in Mumbai in Century City. </p> <p>In the spate of millennial openings last year (Tate Modern, British Museum, the Eye), the assumption of an urban renewal, at least in London, was widespread. It has been no such thing. It was a bid for prestige and status - call it conspicuous civic consumption - in a global competition. The point about the municipal ambitions examined by Worpole is that they were the result of political negotiation and were a physical expression of political ideals. </p> <p>Public works courtesy of private philanthropists, corporations or the lottery is altogether different; it is the equivalent of Father Christmas, largesse to be enjoyed that can be withdrawn at any time.

A third expected to hit the 30% fall by April 2003. </p> <p>The study's author, Adam Geldman, accepted that staff were encouraged far more than they once were to report incidents, but insisted: \"This is a shocking finding. There is no doubt that many frontline NHS staff continue to face a serious risk of being physically assaulted and/or seriously verbally abused while serving the public.\" </p> <p>Mr Geldman said his survey of 45 trusts suggested that reported cases had risen from an average of 419 in 1999 to 511 last year. </p> <p>However, the rise in attacks might be because hospitals were encouraging staff to report complaints more. </p> <p>One trust said that complaints about violence had quadrupled since it revised its reporting procedures. </p> <p>The present levels of violence were \"a blight on the NHS\", said Mr Geldman, although there was strong evidence that many trusts were now responding to government calls to stamp it out. </p> <p>Carol Bannister, occupational health adviser with the Royal College of Nursing, said: \"At least trusts have begun to take some action, although it is also clear that targets, particularly for this year, are not going to be met. </p> <p>\"I am not sure we have seen enough cases of trusts taking serious assaults to court or passing them on to the police.\" </p> <p>A government study in 1998 estimated that there were 65,000 violent incidents every year against NHS staff and the Department of Health is to reassess the size of the problem. </p> <p>It has also warned patients in its new public guide to the NHS that it will not tolerate violence or racial, sexual and verbal harassment from patients or relatives. </p> <p>An advertising campaign by the London ambulance service warns that people convicted of attacking staff will face imprisonment. </p> <p>However, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health said that Mr Geldman's survey was quite small and some trusts had managed \"huge reductions\". </p> <p>She argued that it was unfair to compare individual trusts' performance against national targets. \"We take violence against NHS staff extremely seriously,\" she added.</p>",

The journal Health Service Report said only a fifth of trusts it surveyed believed they would meet government targets for a 20% reduction in workplace violence between 1998 and April this year. A third expected to hit the 30% fall by April 2003. The study's author, Adam Geldman, accepted that staff were encouraged far more than they once were to report incidents, but insisted: \"This is a shocking finding. There is no doubt that many frontline NHS staff continue to face a serious risk of being physically assaulted and/or seriously verbally abused while serving the public.\" Mr Geldman said his survey of 45 trusts suggested that reported cases had risen from an average of 419 in 1999 to 511 last year. However, the rise in attacks might be because hospitals were encouraging staff to report complaints more. One trust said that complaints about violence had quadrupled since it revised its reporting procedures. The present levels of violence were \"a blight on the NHS\", said Mr Geldman, although there was strong evidence that many trusts were now responding to government calls to stamp it out. Carol Bannister, occupational health adviser with the Royal College of Nursing, said: \"At least trusts have begun to take some action, although it is also clear that targets, particularly for this year, are not going to be met. \"I am not sure we have seen enough cases of trusts taking serious assaults to court or passing them on to the police.\" A government study in 1998 estimated that there were 65,000 violent incidents every year against NHS staff and the Department of Health is to reassess the size of the problem. It has also warned patients in its new public guide to the NHS that it will not tolerate violence or racial, sexual and verbal harassment from patients or relatives. An advertising campaign by the London ambulance service warns that people convicted of attacking staff will face imprisonment. However, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health said that Mr Geldman's survey was quite small and some trusts had managed \"huge reductions\". She argued that it was unfair to compare individual trusts' performance against national targets. \"We take violence against NHS staff extremely seriously,\" she added.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Farewell then, Rosie Boycott, and hello Chris Williams. Who? It's easy, and unfair, to make jokes about the new editor of the Daily Express having risen without trace. He doesn't arrive in the job with the high public profile of Boycott or Janet Street-Porter. </p> <p>He has not made his name as a writer, in the mould of Piers Morgan. He hasn't even won the kind of reputation within the industry, gained on their way up, by the likes of Paul Dacre and Simon Kelner. </p> <p>Williams is from an altogether different tradition, a man who has risen to the bridge from the engine room, gradually earning the respect of colleagues and executives for his tech nical abilities. It is hardly an unknown route to the top. Until the past dozen years or so, most editors of popular papers emerged from the subbing desk, including the Express's most famous past editor, Arthur Christiansen. </p> <p>I have known Williams for about 20 years, from the time our paths crossed briefly at the Express, when I quickly realised, to use Fleet Street parlance, that he was a good operator. He could sub fluently, wrote headlines with ease, designed pages without fuss and, most important of all, he could visualise how a story or feature should be projected. </p> <p>Boycott and her deputy, Chris Blackhurst, always acknowledged his importance to the paper. \"They had the ideas and he executed them,\" said one senior staffer. \"He was terrific at the nuts and bolts, at production, at getting the paper out.\" </p> <p>Doubtless, Williams would regard this as being damned with faint praise. It suggests that he is \"only\" a technician and therefore devoid of the ideas - the campaigns, investigations and story hunches - that give every paper its distinctive feel. If Williams is to disprove this insistent criticism from his detractors in the coming months he will need to graft proactive journalistic enterprise on to his undoubted reactive skills. </p> <p>Now 49, he has recently married, for the second time. He and his wife, Daily Mail sub Judy Bywater, have a five-month-old daughter, Alice. Williams started his career on weekly newspapers in his native Liverpool. A life-long Everton supporter, he had youthful hopes himself of becoming a professional footballer, almost signing for a non-league team. </p> <p>After two years on Merseyside, he did a similar stint on weeklies in Kent before joining the subs desk at the Press Association in 1971, which included a spell as a parliamentary reporter. Six years later, he went to the Daily Express, then selling 2.4m under the editorship of Derek Jameson. </p> <p>Four more editors came and went as he rose through the subbing ranks to become features editor, a key role. He was then seduced by a good offer from David English to join the Daily Mail, as assistant features editor, in 1989. </p> <p>By now Williams was a seasoned executive, confident in his abilities and happy in his skin. He was renowned for his rather laid-back attitude, smiling while others panicked, refusing to shout and scream in time-honoured fashion. At the Mail, this lack of hustle and bustle suggested a lack of commitment. Some senior staff, particularly his later editor, Paul Dacre, were upset by Williams's apparent languor. </p> <p>They were particularly irritated by his habit of keeping his jacket on in the office because it suggested he wasn't taking the job seriously. One of his best friends on the Mail told me he also walked around the office \"as if on an afternoon stroll\", which tended to infuriate executives raised to produce a paper in a frenetic atmosphere. \"In truth,\" said another Mail chum, \"he could do the job easily, without breaking sweat, and saw no reason to get steamed up.\" </p> <p>Fearing that he had gone as far up the Mail hierarchy as possible, he returned to the Express in 1995, becoming one of the former Mail boss Richard Addis's key lieutenants as the paper's number three. When Addis was fired in April 1998 in favour of Boycott, the latter decided to replace every one of Addis's senior team with her own appointees. Williams was given notice but he questioned the decision, and Boycott relented after discovering his good reputation among other production journalists. </p> <p>As the only senior Addis executive to survive the putsch, he was always regarded by Boycott and Blackhurst as rather semi-detached. There were often rumours of him bad-mouthing Boycott, accusations that were never proved. He took such pains to appear supportive of Boycott that there was barely a cross word between them in three years. </p> <p>He did not share her news agenda nor her liberal politics. Indeed, though he is reputed to be \"a consummate office politician\", he has shown almost no interest in Westminster politics or international affairs. When he edited the paper, usually on a Sunday, political staff found it difficult to interest him in their stories. \"He's very good on show business and the lighter stuff,\" said one of his former colleagues. \"He can handle serious stories, but it's not what moves him.\" </p> <p>He is sometimes mistaken for Max Clifford - they have a similar mass of snowy hair - and several Express journalists expect him to introduce more entertainment. That would probably chime with the aspi rations of the owner, Richard Desmond. </p> <p>In his negotiations with Desmond, Williams showed that, behind his lackadaisical mask, there is consid erable steel. He refused to accept a position as \"acting\" editor, demanding the full title instead. It's to be hoped that he has secured a legally watertight contract because - whatever Williams' skills - the future for the paper looks anything but bright. </p> <p>Sales are falling by the week, and I wouldn't be surprised if the Express finds if difficult to stay above the 1m mark in the next month or so. </p> <p>As if the chalice isn't poisoned enough, Williams will also soon be expected to make up to 100 of his journalists redundant. That may not happen until March, the deadline for a Department of Trade and Industry referral of Desmond's takeover of Express Newspapers to the competition commission. Williams has certainly got the toughest job in Fleet Street just now.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Farewell then, Rosie Boycott, and hello Chris Williams. Who? It's easy, and unfair, to make jokes about the new editor of the Daily Express having risen without trace. He doesn't arrive in the job with the high public profile of Boycott or Janet Street-Porter. He has not made his name as a writer, in the mould of Piers Morgan. He hasn't even won the kind of reputation within the industry, gained on their way up, by the likes of Paul Dacre and Simon Kelner. Williams is from an altogether different tradition, a man who has risen to the bridge from the engine room, gradually earning the respect of colleagues and executives for his tech nical abilities. It is hardly an unknown route to the top. Until the past dozen years or so, most editors of popular papers emerged from the subbing desk, including the Express's most famous past editor, Arthur Christiansen. I have known Williams for about 20 years, from the time our paths crossed briefly at the Express, when I quickly realised, to use Fleet Street parlance, that he was a good operator. He could sub fluently, wrote headlines with ease, designed pages without fuss and, most important of all, he could visualise how a story or feature should be projected. Boycott and her deputy, Chris Blackhurst, always acknowledged his importance to the paper. \"They had the ideas and he executed them,\" said one senior staffer. \"He was terrific at the nuts and bolts, at production, at getting the paper out.\" Doubtless, Williams would regard this as being damned with faint praise. It suggests that he is \"only\" a technician and therefore devoid of the ideas - the campaigns, investigations and story hunches - that give every paper its distinctive feel. If Williams is to disprove this insistent criticism from his detractors in the coming months he will need to graft proactive journalistic enterprise on to his undoubted reactive skills. Now 49, he has recently married, for the second time. He and his wife, Daily Mail sub Judy Bywater, have a five-month-old daughter, Alice. Williams started his career on weekly newspapers in his native Liverpool. A life-long Everton supporter, he had youthful hopes himself of becoming a professional footballer, almost signing for a non-league team. After two years on Merseyside, he did a similar stint on weeklies in Kent before joining the subs desk at the Press Association in 1971, which included a spell as a parliamentary reporter. Six years later, he went to the Daily Express, then selling 2.4m under the editorship of Derek Jameson. Four more editors came and went as he rose through the subbing ranks to become features editor, a key role. He was then seduced by a good offer from David English to join the Daily Mail, as assistant features editor, in 1989. By now Williams was a seasoned executive, confident in his abilities and happy in his skin. He was renowned for his rather laid-back attitude, smiling while others panicked, refusing to shout and scream in time-honoured fashion. At the Mail, this lack of hustle and bustle suggested a lack of commitment. Some senior staff, particularly his later editor, Paul Dacre, were upset by Williams's apparent languor. They were particularly irritated by his habit of keeping his jacket on in the office because it suggested he wasn't taking the job seriously. One of his best friends on the Mail told me he also walked around the office \"as if on an afternoon stroll\", which tended to infuriate executives raised to produce a paper in a frenetic atmosphere. \"In truth,\" said another Mail chum, \"he could do the job easily, without breaking sweat, and saw no reason to get steamed up.\" Fearing that he had gone as far up the Mail hierarchy as possible, he returned to the Express in 1995, becoming one of the former Mail boss Richard Addis's key lieutenants as the paper's number three. When Addis was fired in April 1998 in favour of Boycott, the latter decided to replace every one of Addis's senior team with her own appointees. Williams was given notice but he questioned the decision, and Boycott relented after discovering his good reputation among other production journalists. As the only senior Addis executive to survive the putsch, he was always regarded by Boycott and Blackhurst as rather semi-detached. There were often rumours of him bad-mouthing Boycott, accusations that were never proved. He took such pains to appear supportive of Boycott that there was barely a cross word between them in three years. He did not share her news agenda nor her liberal politics. Indeed, though he is reputed to be \"a consummate office politician\", he has shown almost no interest in Westminster politics or international affairs. When he edited the paper, usually on a Sunday, political staff found it difficult to interest him in their stories. \"He's very good on show business and the lighter stuff,\" said one of his former colleagues. \"He can handle serious stories, but it's not what moves him.\" He is sometimes mistaken for Max Clifford - they have a similar mass of snowy hair - and several Express journalists expect him to introduce more entertainment. That would probably chime with the aspi rations of the owner, Richard Desmond. In his negotiations with Desmond, Williams showed that, behind his lackadaisical mask, there is consid erable steel. He refused to accept a position as \"acting\" editor, demanding the full title instead. It's to be hoped that he has secured a legally watertight contract because - whatever Williams' skills - the future for the paper looks anything but bright. Sales are falling by the week, and I wouldn't be surprised if the Express finds if difficult to stay above the 1m mark in the next month or so. As if the chalice isn't poisoned enough, Williams will also soon be expected to make up to 100 of his journalists redundant. That may not happen until March, the deadline for a Department of Trade and Industry referral of Desmond's takeover of Express Newspapers to the competition commission. Williams has certainly got the toughest job in Fleet Street just now.",

The first Lynx barber shop was launched last October on London's Oxford Street. A second shop will open in Kingston-on-Thames this month and the company is looking at further sites across the country. The innovative move contributed to a revival of the Lynx brand, which now has a 30% share of the male toiletries market. According to independent industry figures, the Lynx brand was worth \u00a380m last year in the UK alone. Now, Unilever is planning to replicate its Lynx success with its Dove line of moisturising soaps and skincare products. The plans are at an early stage but are thought to involve a new health and beauty retail brand. Taking your brand onto the high street has become the latest marketing tool, with Cadbury and Kenco launching branded cafes.

      "body": "<p><strong> Observer</strong><br> </p> <p> A pre-election tax cutting bonanza appears to be off the agenda as a softening British economy and an acceleration in spending on public services puts the squeeze on the size of the Treasury surplus. </p> <p>Although final figures will still hand Gordon Brown a surplus of many billions, its size is expected to be far closer to the existing Treasury predictions of \u00a310bn than the over-optimistic predictions by City analysts at the time of November's pre-Budget report. </p> <p>Water regulator Philip Fletcher is expected to agree to controversial proposals for restructuring <strong> Welsh Water</strong> - formerly owned by the multi-utility Hyder - but he is likely to attach onerous conditions to the deal. </p> <p>Industry and regulatory sources say that Mr Fletcher is sceptical about the proposals and claim his conditions may make the scheme unviable. </p> <p><strong> Sunday Times</strong><br> </p> <p> Corporate Britain is on the brink of crisis. The latest statistics about profit warnings show that there has been more than one warning a day since the beginning of the year and this trend is predicted to continue for months to come. </p> <p>The gloomy outlook comes as <strong> Ernst &amp; Young</strong>, one of the \"big five\" accountancy companies, prepares to issue its latest quarterly profits warning statistics. It will reveal that there were nearly 80 profits warnings in the final quarter of 2000, a rise of 70% since the summer. </p> <p>The plans to merge <strong> Abbey National</strong> and <strong> Bank of Scotland</strong> have run into trouble. The two institutions are at loggerheads over the location of the new bank's headquarters. Disquiet over the division of management jobs has also emerged - despite an earlier private agreement on these fundamental issues. </p> <p><strong> Sunday Telegraph</strong><br> </p> <p> Sir CK Chow, below, is preparing to step down as chief executive of <strong> GKN</strong> as part of the engineering group's reorganisation plans. He is planning to become chief executive of <strong> Brambles</strong>, the Australian industrial services group which has a number of joint ventures with GKN. </p> <p>Hans Rausing, the former chief executive of <strong> Tetra Pak</strong> and the richest man in Britain, has emerged from apparent retirement to galvanise the packaging industry he once dominated. </p> <p>Mr Rausing has taken a controlling interest in <strong> EcoLean</strong>, the creator of an environmentally friendly packaging material made from plastic and chalk. </p> <p><strong> BT</strong> is preparing to demerge <strong> Yell</strong>, its directories business, to shareholders as an alternative to its \u00a34bn to \u00a35bn flotation plan. The group is considering proposals to load Yell with up to \u00a31bn in debt - which would be roughly equivalent to the proceeds after tax from floating 25% of the shares on the stock market. </p> <p><strong> Mail on Sunday</strong><br> </p> <p> The <strong> Post Office</strong> is to offer cut-price stakeholder pensions at its 18,000 branches from April.

      "bodyText": "Observer A pre-election tax cutting bonanza appears to be off the agenda as a softening British economy and an acceleration in spending on public services puts the squeeze on the size of the Treasury surplus. Although final figures will still hand Gordon Brown a surplus of many billions, its size is expected to be far closer to the existing Treasury predictions of \u00a310bn than the over-optimistic predictions by City analysts at the time of November's pre-Budget report. Water regulator Philip Fletcher is expected to agree to controversial proposals for restructuring Welsh Water - formerly owned by the multi-utility Hyder - but he is likely to attach onerous conditions to the deal. Industry and regulatory sources say that Mr Fletcher is sceptical about the proposals and claim his conditions may make the scheme unviable. Sunday Times Corporate Britain is on the brink of crisis. The latest statistics about profit warnings show that there has been more than one warning a day since the beginning of the year and this trend is predicted to continue for months to come. The gloomy outlook comes as Ernst &amp; Young, one of the \"big five\" accountancy companies, prepares to issue its latest quarterly profits warning statistics. It will reveal that there were nearly 80 profits warnings in the final quarter of 2000, a rise of 70% since the summer. The plans to merge Abbey National and Bank of Scotland have run into trouble. The two institutions are at loggerheads over the location of the new bank's headquarters. Disquiet over the division of management jobs has also emerged - despite an earlier private agreement on these fundamental issues. Sunday Telegraph Sir CK Chow, below, is preparing to step down as chief executive of GKN as part of the engineering group's reorganisation plans. He is planning to become chief executive of Brambles, the Australian industrial services group which has a number of joint ventures with GKN. Hans Rausing, the former chief executive of Tetra Pak and the richest man in Britain, has emerged from apparent retirement to galvanise the packaging industry he once dominated. Mr Rausing has taken a controlling interest in EcoLean, the creator of an environmentally friendly packaging material made from plastic and chalk. BT is preparing to demerge Yell, its directories business, to shareholders as an alternative to its \u00a34bn to \u00a35bn flotation plan. The group is considering proposals to load Yell with up to \u00a31bn in debt - which would be roughly equivalent to the proceeds after tax from floating 25% of the shares on the stock market. Mail on Sunday The Post Office is to offer cut-price stakeholder pensions at its 18,000 branches from April. The initiative - due to be announced on February 6 - is a coup for the Post Office, which is still buoyant after a deal with banks to sell no-frills accounts. IoS Alchemy, the venture capitalist which last year attempted to buy Rover, is close to losing one of its biggest investors, JP Morgan. The private equity arm of JP Morgan Chase, the American investment bank, has decided to cease investing in Alchemy in a move that will come as a blow to Jon Moulton, the venture capital firm's high profile deal maker. Sunday Business BT's biggest investors will this week urge the company to rethink its strategy and opt for a complete break-up. Instead of partial spin-offs of its businesses such as Wireless and Yell, the company will be urged to consider demerging entire operating subsidiaries. Anxiety is growing among European retailers and bankers that there will be serious problems when euro notes and coins are introduced next January, according to analysts at investment bank Nomura.

You should answer the following questions: what will the increase in gross domestic product be in 2001; what will the Bank of England's base lending rate be on December 31; what will the level of inflation - excluding mortgage interest payments - be on December 31; what will the unemployment total as measured by the seasonally adjusted claimant count be on December 2001; what will the UK current account be in 2001 - in pounds not as a percentage of GDP - and what will sterling's value against the euro be on December 31 - that is, how much one euro will buy? Entries are welcome from all those who fancy themselves as an economics pundit. Previous years have shown that a sixth-former is as likely to win as a City analyst. The prize is \u00a3500 worth of book tokens from leading publisher Palgrave. Answers on a postcard to: Guardian Economics Competition, Economics Desk, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER. You can also enter via: Predict the future of the economy Online entries will also be in the running to win a Palgrave economics dictionary. Guardian competition rules apply, and the deadline for entries is February 1.",

Things aren't working out the way they were supposed to when the grand design was outlined at the start of the 90s. There's a bit more humility and a greater willingness to accept that those who have been warning about the nasty side-effects of one size fits all integration might have a point. </p> <p>Klaus Schwab, the man behind the World Economic Forum, neatly summed the state of play when he said there were seven challenges of globalisation, none of which seemed the slightest bit controversial. Schwab's list of problems is worth considering, because it could be considered the modern equivalent of the five giants identified by Beveridge as standing in the way of progress when he was writing his report on the need for a cradle to grave welfare state in 1942. </p> <p>First on Schwab's list came the need to create conditions for faster growth. Then he cited the need for environmental and social sustainablility, followed by effective international peace keeping, a narrowing of the technological and social gulf between rich and poor, the need for higher standards of health and nutrition, a common understanding of human rights and values and, finally, the safeguarding of cultural identity in an increasingly homogenised world. Or, in the lingo of Beveridge, Want, Pollution, War, Ignorance, Disease, Cruelty and Uniformity. </p> <p>The immediate riposte to Schwab's list is that this is a case of motherhood and apple pie. But this has not always been so, even in the recent past. The idea that globalisation has no future without greater inclusion, without environmental sustainability and without a concern for the human dimension, was certainly not in evidence in the first few years after the Berlin Wall came down. But life has moved on. The climate is not so benign and the Lyndon Johnson principle is now at work: it's better to have the protestors inside the tent pissing out than on the outside pissing in. </p> <p>So, that's the good news. What's the bad news? Well, the fact that Davos was turned into a fortress at the weekend is symptomatic of some deeper malaise. Civil society representatives who were invited to take part in the World Economic Forum were rightly concerned about the way in which the Swiss government treated those who sought to express their concerns about globalisation in a peaceful way on the town's streets. </p> <p>What this means, of course, is that getting the rhetoric right is one thing, changing behaviour is quite another. It's easy to make all the right noises about making globalisation inclusive, but what does this mean when the rich countries of the world are spending $1bn a day subsidising their farmers, with the annual subsidy three times as large as the entire amount spent on aid budgets? Not a lot... </p> <p>How much credence should we give to those who argue that free trade will work for everyone when the modest if welcome plan by the EU's trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, to give duty free access to all goods except arms from the 48 poorest countries was met with a barrage of protectionist objections from the big barons of the European sugar industry? Not a great deal. How genuine is the commitment to tackling the epidemic of HIV-Aids in Africa when the big drugs companies use their enormous financial and legal clout to prevent poor countries from manufacturing their own cheap generic cures? You tell me. </p> <p>Moving from words to action is going to be tough. Playing chess is not simply about knowing that a bishop moves diagonally or that a pawn can move forward two squares on its first move, it is about the overall strategy. Sometimes a tactical retreat paves the way for a strategic advance. The good player also knows when to make a sacrifice. </p> <p>Those running the global economy appear to lack the grand master strategy. They have all their pieces but don't know how to play the game. The chaotic state of Russia in its first decade after the collapse of communism is largely due to the ill-conceived sequencing of moves, with privatisation and the scrapping of foreign exchange controls leading to larceny and capital flight on a grand scale. The economy halved in size in a decade; male life expectancy dropped by 10 years. </p> <p>China, by contrast, has followed a more cautious approach, liberalising selectively and at its own pace; more people have been lifted out of poverty in the past 20 years than at any time in human history. </p> <p>The key to a successful strategy is getting the sequencing right. Higher growth in developing countries is not just a question of them opening their markets and liberalising their capital accounts - indeed, these policies may be more of a hindrance than a help. These should be final moves in the chess game rather than the opening gambits. Instead, they need debt cancellation, better access to the rich markets of the north and an increase in aid. </p> <p>Yashwant Sinha, the finance minister of India, said that nobody in developing countries challenged the inevitability or the potential benefits of globalisation, but that the rich countries needed to learn some facts of life. </p> <p>Firstly, it was impossible to achieve globalisation in an unequal world. Secondly, the problems of the environment were not caused by consumption patterns in the south but by the lifestyles of people in the north, and developing countries were unwilling to listen to sermons about sustainability from those doing most of the global polluting. Finally, the west needed to do something about its skewed approach to migration since the system involved poaching the brightest and the best from poor countries and putting up barriers to the rest. According to Mr Sinha, 38% of all doctors in the US are Indians, as are 34% of the scientists at Nasa. </p> <p>The real question is whether the west, which is so keen on telling poor countries what to do, is capable of change itself. It's easy, at this point, to look at the way the Americans scuppered the climate talks in the Hague last year and give up. Yet, as the debt campaign showed, it is possible to force change even against the most implacable of opponents, provided that economics plays second fiddle to politics. </p> <p>The renaissance of politics has perhaps been the most important development of the past few years. It is now clear that the future of the planet cannot be entrusted to the divine workings of the market or left in the hands of corporations. There are choices to be made, and they are political choices. </p> <p>But isn't it a problem that governments tend to listen to the voices of business, rather than civil society? You bet it is. In the shorthand of the modern world, business is seen as dynamic, civil society as conservative. But as Ed Mayo of the New Economics Foundation said in Davos this weekend, nearly all the great leaps forward for mankind have been as a result of pressure from civil society. If governments are looking for creativity, enterprise and innovation, then historically they should look beyond the boardroom. </p> <p>Unfortunately, recapturing politics may be a long, slow process. The historian Paul Kennedy said that he was now insisting that all his students at Harvard study the great leaders of the past so they would be able to think strategically when they took up their positions at the head of the global elite of the future. This is sensible stuff. Our technical ability to make things and to pollute now far outstrips our ability to understand the processes we have unleashed.

Its deteriorating financial performance has been linked by some to its authoritarian management patterns. </p> <p>Ms Owen says: \"A staff member was rapped on the knuckles after he tried to change a system. He had noticed that customers were getting annoyed with queuing and did something to help, but without the relevant authority.\" </p> <p>Ms Owen believes that Asda's inclusive style is the pattern that should be followed. But apart from a small computer services company in Southampton, 2GL, she struggles to think of British companies which are moving in the right direction. </p> <p>Staff at 2GL start arriving at 7.30am, not because they have to but because they are enthused by what is going on. They are encouraged to participate in community projects and identify with the goals of the company, she says. Tesco and Royal Bank of Scotland deserve mentions, she says, the latter because of the work being done at its call centre in Bristol. \"These can be bad places to work, but the manager won a leadership award because he produced a happy atmosphere where the employees felt valued.\" </p> <p>Ms Owen says companies who ignore workforce potential will have to change or pay the price. The recent defection of Asda boss Allan Leighton suggests even the forward-thinking companies have more work to do in this area. </p> <p>But how will the institute help? It hopes to act as a focal point and a catalyst for change. The non-profit making organisation, where Ms Owen will act as founder and chief executive, expects next month to launch a United Nations-funded initiative as well as working with organisations such as the Institute of Directors on leadership training programmes. </p> <p>Ms Owen describes herself as \"an ordinary Cardiff girl\", who in 30 years has gone from impoverished beautician to much sought-after management consultant. </p> <p>She left a broken home at the age of 16 and studied politics to degree level in Plymouth before going on to work with US computer group IBM. </p> <p>She has seen the worst impact of autocratic management at close quarters working for the Maxwell Corporation. She has also had a taste of the public sector when helping the Department of Trade and Industry launch its enterprise initiative. </p> <p>But the big change came in 1991, when she attended a business breakfast given by the team manager of the RAF Red Arrows. \"He talked about how formation flying was like driving at 200mph up the motorway, bumper to bumper with eight other cars. I realised the power that came from that level of trust. </p> <p>\"At the end of the talk I thrust my card in his hand and said, 'ring me, I have an idea'. A month later I was making a video and carrying out research on Red Arrows leadership style\". </p> <p>It eventually resulted in a well received book from Ms Owen titled Creating Top Flight Teams. Next month Ms Owen will release her next tome, Unleashing Leaders, which also touches on the issue of trust. </p> <p>This key point came up again talking to a seminar of top ranking policemen on leadership issues. \"I told them if they wanted to move forward they had to trust their staff and trust each other. When I asked the room if they trusted each other now, they all shook their heads.\" Ms Owen quotes TV chat show host Oprah Winfrey, saying how good it felt to talk openly about her private life. Oprah found her trust was rewarded by journalists warming to this newly exposed humanity. </p> <p>\"Her openness and honesty enabled viewers to relate to the woman,\" says the author. </p> <p>Ms Owen herself is not always so trusting it seems - at least in one to one interviews. A request for her age does not go down well. </p> <p>Nor even a question about what car she drives. She is clearly much more at home on the conference podium or in seminars. </p> <p>John Weston, a director at the IoD, describes her as \"dynamic\", and says the work she is doing is \"crucial\" for British business. </p> <p>It can be easier at first glance to see the beautician rather than an expert on leadership. </p> <p>But then that's one of her points. Old stereotypes should be cast aside.</p>",

A month later I was making a video and carrying out research on Red Arrows leadership style\". It eventually resulted in a well received book from Ms Owen titled Creating Top Flight Teams. Next month Ms Owen will release her next tome, Unleashing Leaders, which also touches on the issue of trust. This key point came up again talking to a seminar of top ranking policemen on leadership issues. \"I told them if they wanted to move forward they had to trust their staff and trust each other. When I asked the room if they trusted each other now, they all shook their heads.\" Ms Owen quotes TV chat show host Oprah Winfrey, saying how good it felt to talk openly about her private life. Oprah found her trust was rewarded by journalists warming to this newly exposed humanity. \"Her openness and honesty enabled viewers to relate to the woman,\" says the author. Ms Owen herself is not always so trusting it seems - at least in one to one interviews. A request for her age does not go down well. Nor even a question about what car she drives. She is clearly much more at home on the conference podium or in seminars. John Weston, a director at the IoD, describes her as \"dynamic\", and says the work she is doing is \"crucial\" for British business. It can be easier at first glance to see the beautician rather than an expert on leadership. But then that's one of her points. Old stereotypes should be cast aside.",

      "body": "<p>The rise of the far-right Freedom party (FPO) in Austria, under the leadership of the yuppie fascist J\u00f6rg Haider, thrust the alpine republic into a limelight it was wholly unused to.</p> <p>The trouble began when the conservative People's party broke a pre-election promise and formed a coalition with the FPO. Austria immediately began paying the price of a government involving Haider - the man who had praised Hitler's policies - as Europe introduced sanctions.</p> <p>But a glance back on the last year reveals that it has not all been doom and gloom. \"Although we don't appreciate what's going on in Austria we do have a lot of fun,\" was how a young Viennese internet publisher summed it up. Pledging to push through privatisation, deregulation and social welfare reforms, the coalition government adopted the English slogan Speed Kills, meaning those against the changes would be swept aside, rather than the Ginsbergian interpretation. Intellectuals chuckled.</p> <p>Then came the cuddly elephants. The FPO's Vienna MP Hilmar Kabas denounced President Thomas Klestil as a \"lump\", meaning \"trash\", then denied it, saying he had said \"hump\", or \"dump\" - words that have no meaning in German. The FPO, ever-skilled at turning things in its favour, began marketing its new mascots, elephants Humpy and Dumpy.</p> <p>At the end of Feb ruary, Haider resigned as party leader, putting Susanne Riess-Passer (dubbed \"the king's cobra\") in his place.

      "bodyText": "The rise of the far-right Freedom party (FPO) in Austria, under the leadership of the yuppie fascist J\u00f6rg Haider, thrust the alpine republic into a limelight it was wholly unused to. The trouble began when the conservative People's party broke a pre-election promise and formed a coalition with the FPO. Austria immediately began paying the price of a government involving Haider - the man who had praised Hitler's policies - as Europe introduced sanctions. But a glance back on the last year reveals that it has not all been doom and gloom. \"Although we don't appreciate what's going on in Austria we do have a lot of fun,\" was how a young Viennese internet publisher summed it up. Pledging to push through privatisation, deregulation and social welfare reforms, the coalition government adopted the English slogan Speed Kills, meaning those against the changes would be swept aside, rather than the Ginsbergian interpretation. Intellectuals chuckled. Then came the cuddly elephants. The FPO's Vienna MP Hilmar Kabas denounced President Thomas Klestil as a \"lump\", meaning \"trash\", then denied it, saying he had said \"hump\", or \"dump\" - words that have no meaning in German. The FPO, ever-skilled at turning things in its favour, began marketing its new mascots, elephants Humpy and Dumpy. At the end of Feb ruary, Haider resigned as party leader, putting Susanne Riess-Passer (dubbed \"the king's cobra\") in his place. But throughout the year he has continued to be the FPO's de facto leader, ruling from the southern province of Carinthia where he is governor. Observers say he has now given up all hope of fulfilling his life's dream of becoming chancellor - no foreign leader would ever want to be seen shaking his hand. Unless of course that leader's name is Gadaffi. Haider the pariah stokes the fire every now and again by taking business trips to Libya and Iraq where he has purchased cheap fuel for the Carinthians. And last week an Austrian paper revealed that he was flown on a \"secret mission\" to Moscow by the pistol manufacturer Gaston Glock, to look at buying Soviet fighter jets. He has also cuddled up to the far-right in Italy where he is viewed as a bit of a hero, and was received by the Pope at Christmas when His Holiness apparently lectured him on racial tolerance. At the end of last year the party came in for the most intense scrutiny, when policemen revealed Haider had paid them to provide him with secret files on his opponents. The sensitive right-winger has also proved himself to be one of the most litigious politicians in Europe, having at any one time 100 law suits against his opponents - including stand-up comedians - on the go.

Nurses used to be our angels, she said - cue a rousing chorus of Robbie singing Angels - \"now, they risk a new label: fallen angels\". </p> <p>The personal testimonies, from patients' families and nurses themselves, which would have sounded like scaremongering six months ago, now had a terrible familiarity about them. A woman left on a commode in her ward for half an hour died on it, another woman's soiled nightdress simply had a clean one placed over the top.

No one wants to wipe bottoms any more; \"they just want to come in, do the job and go home\". For all the terror in these tales, the programme ultimately still left us feeling sorry for nurses. It quietly raised the question of who would want to dedicate themselves to messy TLC, given the pay, conditions and other opportunities on offer. </p> <p>You could tell right away that Lou Stein's mother, Carmen, wasn't in an NHS hospital. \"This food is delicious, have some!\" she enthused to her son, who was nursing her for terminal cervical cancer. A year after her death, theatre director Stein made a \"sound diary\" for Radio 3's consistently impressive experimental series, <strong> Between The Ears</strong> . </p> <p>My Month With Carmen used a backdrop of sounds (noises from the hospital ward, orchestral music like a heart monitor, the deep hollow sound of assisted breathing) along with actors and Stein himself to make this ordinary story into something different - about the nature of grief and memory rather than death itself. </p> <p>But it was claustrophobic and sad too, as Stein read his mother's journals about her journey from Puerto Rico to New York - he had known nothing of this. Stein was worried, apparently, that his account would be too schmaltzy. It was anything but, and yet it made the most emotionally draining episode of ER seem like a programme for wimps.</p>",

For all the terror in these tales, the programme ultimately still left us feeling sorry for nurses. It quietly raised the question of who would want to dedicate themselves to messy TLC, given the pay, conditions and other opportunities on offer. You could tell right away that Lou Stein's mother, Carmen, wasn't in an NHS hospital. \"This food is delicious, have some!\" she enthused to her son, who was nursing her for terminal cervical cancer. A year after her death, theatre director Stein made a \"sound diary\" for Radio 3's consistently impressive experimental series, Between The Ears . My Month With Carmen used a backdrop of sounds (noises from the hospital ward, orchestral music like a heart monitor, the deep hollow sound of assisted breathing) along with actors and Stein himself to make this ordinary story into something different - about the nature of grief and memory rather than death itself. But it was claustrophobic and sad too, as Stein read his mother's journals about her journey from Puerto Rico to New York - he had known nothing of this. Stein was worried, apparently, that his account would be too schmaltzy. It was anything but, and yet it made the most emotionally draining episode of ER seem like a programme for wimps.",

You've done your research on how to write a sitcom - the Rule of Three, the smash cut, the notion of clowning-as-pain. You've been to watch live recordings of new ITV sitcom Mr Silly, and Channel 4's new interactive sitdotcom Innit. You've studied the comedy architecture of 'Allo 'Allo. Now what the hell do you write about? </p> <p>The chances are that if you are a psychotherapist, for example, you will set your comedy series among psychotherapists, and call it something with Couch or Shrink in the title. It's good to write about what you know, of course, but the temptation is to shoe-horn an unwieldy, humorous incident from your professional life, involving for example a couch, a mysterious sticky stain and an escaped monkey. But do bear in mind the phrase \"You had to be there\". No one has ever said to me (and I wish they would), \"I'm an accountant/ newsagent/feng shui consultant. We'd be rubbish in a sitcom.\" </p> <p>Any setting can work, I'm convinced, if you get the characters and tone right, and can get hold of Ronnie Barker. But it's true that some workplaces are harder to get right than others. Good luck to anyone setting a situation comedy in the office of a Child Abuse Helpline, for instance. And the world of stunt men or midwives in the Outback may lose something in translation to a bunch of plywood scenery in a Shepherds Bush studio. I personally won't rush home to watch a series set in a morgue. </p> <p>Incidentally, a successful sitcom creates a vacuum around its area of interest. No comedy professionals wrote about hotels with any degree of confidence for 20 years after Fawlty Towers. And a sitcom set among civil servants couldn't get arrested after Yes Minister, thereby frustrating a whole generation of disaffected junior bureaucrats with media ambitions. </p> <p>More and more comedy series are being set at work. Office Gossip, starring Pauline Quirk, is about to start on BBC1. Bob Martin, set in a TV studio, will return shortly. Beast, the BBC1 sitcom that I write, is set in a vet's practice. Do watch it while you can. In these days of teleworking and short-term contracts, this may be pre-nostalgia for a time when the workplace offered more of a sense of community and permanence. This is one of a number of cod-sociological theories I'll be sharing with you. </p> <p>One of the more sensible theories about sitcoms (for professional reasons I'll pass over the theory that they're all dreadful and we should sit down and read a good book) is that the best ones are about characters who are trapped. And where are we more trapped than at work? The hierarchies of the workplace were exploited particularly early on, in the likes of Bilko, The Rag Trade, and - may we be forgiven - On The Buses. It would be dangerously pretentious to make the claim that these shows had a genuinely subversive effect on people's attitude to their jobs, but I'll say it anyway. </p> <p>The question is, after a hard day at work, do viewers really want to come home and watch people having a hard day at work, and pretending it's funny? But the truth is, most people's workplaces are funny. Not necessarily for the incidents (\"and then Brian from Docketing came in with his head stuck in the paper towel dispenser...\"), but the banter. A big prize will go to the first sitcom that properly conveys the unforced hilarity of the best office conversation, the way Cheers captured the essence of bar room repartee. </p> <p>The appeal of TV-as-escape is belied by the popularity of soaps, which thrust a monstrously grim version of reality into the nation's face every evening. It's true that the reality is heightened - so few characters, so many mysterious deaths - but the basic gruel of argument, misery and mutual loathing is, perhaps, depressingly authentic. </p> <p>But comedy may be starting to learn lessons from TV drama, not least because it is generally getting whupped in the ratings. Fifteen million people tune in to the cyn ical, arid Heartbeat, while an airy, subtle sitcom like Kiss Me Kate is lucky to get a third of that. But don't get me started. The Royle Family notwithstanding, viewers want three plots in an episode, and where else are you going to get that kind of action and mobility but at work? </p> <p>Domestic sitcoms - whose finest hour was the legendary \"Heil Honey I'm Home\", about a Jewish couple who live next door to Hitler (filmed but never shown) - have always been the staple of British TV. The leisurely, static nature of home life - not to mention the boxy, overlit interiors - is perfect for sitcoms. A neighbour pops round: high-drama! Something falls out of a kitchen cupboard: whoa, slow down there! The apotheosis of the British domestic sitcom, Terry And June, has been mercilessly pilloried for its, shall we say, limited horizons. A more charitable view would be that it was the kabuki of sitcoms, highly stylised and making much of very little. You could even say that, pre-empting Seinfeld, it was a \"sitcom about nothing\". You'd be foolish to say it, but you could. </p> <p>Work-based comedy series are more robust. They do, however, have a very troubled relationship with reality. How much like life do you actually want your comedy? Larry Sanders works because, among other things, it looks and sounds hideously authentic. This is partly, it has to be said, because everyone says \"fuck\" a lot, the way we all do in television. But if you enjoy the characters, then the milieu tends to look genuine, whether it is or not. The glimpses of the media that you get in I'm Alan Partridge seemed completely authentic, although they pushed the boundaries of the absurd. Nor am I convinced that Father Ted is an accurate reflection of Irish clerical life, but it might as well be. And my own series, Is It Legal?, was criticised by Law Student magazine for not depicting the reality of a solicitor's office. No there's a stunning compliment if ever there was one. </p> <p>So if you ever take time off work to write your sitcom, Shrinking Violet, about a Freudian therapist called... you guessed it, or Bun In The Oven (set in a bakery, owner possibly called Bunn), or Please Mend My Bicycle! (set in a bicycle repair shop), or Morgue's The Merrier, don't expect anyone in your profession to enjoy it. But you can be consoled that you are contributing to a genre that has given us such classics as Doctor Down Under, Mind Your Language and The Flying Nun.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The last time the secret diarist Adrian Mole was televised, he was nervously measuring his penis with his school ruler and applying acne cream to a moonscape face. Returning to the screen in Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years (Friday, 9.30pm, BBC1), the damage limitation in the bathroom has spread from gratifyingly smooth cheeks to a dismayingly smooth scalp, displaying the beginnings of middle-aged baldness and, whether or not he's still fretful about its dimensions, his equipment has measured up to the extent of fathering at least one child and possibly two. </p> <p>When Sue Townsend published The Cappuccino Years as a novel in 1999, the book took its place in a fiction bestseller list dominated by sequels. This sixth volume of Mole's diaries jostled with the further chronicles of Harry Potter, Hannibal Lecter and Bridget Jones. The trick in re-animating a long-running character is the timing of the revivals. There needs to have been time for the person and the world around them to have changed. Mind the gap. </p> <p>In The Cappuccino Years, Townsend judged the jump to perfection. Mole (Stephen Mangan) is rediscovered on a pivotal day: the eve of the election of the Labour government in 1997. Long established as a hopeless innocent, he is a Blairite true believer. It feels exactly right that Pandora Braithwaite (Helen Baxendale), object of Adrian's fetid sexual fantasies since he first took up his pen as an adolescent, should now, as Dr Braithwaite, be the New Labour candidate in the Leicester constituency where they both grew up. In his characteristic, doleful, sub-Proustian tone, Mole remembers being \"the first to insert my hand inside the cup of her white training bra. Hers was the first nipple I ever saw, pink like a hamster's tongue\". Equally appropriate is Mole's current job, as chef in Hoi Polloi, a new British restaurant in Soho specialising in offal. He views this as a temporary profession while he waits acceptance by the BBC of The White Van, a \"serial killer comedy in 12 parts\". </p> <p>Leicestershire, which represented the grim and dull English Midlands when Townsend started writing, now stands for Middle England, capital of Blair's political kingdom. Jobless for years, Adrian's dad George (Alun Armstrong) stays in bed all day, taking Prozac, but - in an odd slip of topicality - not Viagra, although he is impotent and under treatment: \"I'm not having those injections in my dick again.\" Pauline Mole (Alison Steadman) is sexually restless, drawn to Pandora's father Ivan (James Hazeldine) who, being a New Labour campaign manager, scatters her with rose petals before they commit adultery. </p> <p>None of this is going to bring down a government, but the targets are the right ones and, while political satire often dates, The cappuccino Years feels sharper on TV than on the page because Townsend's focus is the optimism of those May days. </p> <p>The point has frequently been made in reviews of the brilliant presidential drama The West Wing (Thursday, 10pm, Channel 4) that American television creates political drama in which the processes of democracy are taken seriously, while British shows about politics are gags and satire. Someone using this generalisation in a TV Studies exam would get full marks, but, within the limits of sit-com, The Cappuccino Years is quietly subversive. </p> <p>When Pauline tells her unemployed husband, \"Tony will get you a job\", or David Dimbleby's voice seeps from the Moles' TV set mentioning that this is the largest Labour majority ever, the series captures something of the now painful hopefulness of that election day. You wouldn't, for example, advise Peter Mandelson to fill the spare time he now has by watching this series, unless he wants another reminder of the distance between ambition and reality. </p> <p>Townsend's lines frequently surprise. Ivan's wife knows he's betraying her when she finds a Kit-Kat wrapper in his pocket. You don't understand this until she later explains that the right-on couple have been \"boycotting Rowntrees products since 1979\" because of their fears about cocoa beanfarming. After his mother babysits Adrian's son, she hands him back with the warning: \"Don't put him on the floor - he's pretending it's the open sea.\" Trains and cars are things you want to see coming, but the best dialogue hits you from nowhere, and Townsend's frequently does. </p> <p>A satire of New Labour, The Cappuccino Years also, in one curious way, represents a new BBC. Under John Birt, BBC current affairs presenters were banned from appearing as themselves in comedies and dramas, because of fears that fictionalisation robbed them of authority. For this reason, the headlines were usually read in TV dramas by Pamela Armstron, Jan Leeming, Richard Whitmore, or other former newsreaders. (In the 1993 BBC2 political comedy The Vision Thing, incidentally, the newsreader was played by a then Daily Mirror reporter, Alistair Campbell.) This rule now seems to have lapsed because, in the second episode of The Cappuccino Years, Dr Pandora Braithwaite, now a Blair Babe, is interviewed on the Newsnight set by Jeremy Paxman, who is undone by her brazen sexuality. Paxman exposing Labour MPs as heterosexual on-air - it's about the only thing that doesn't feel accurate in this sparky picture of the Blair Years. </p> <p>\u0095 Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years, Friday, 9.30pm, BBC1 (not Scotland)</p>",

He views this as a temporary profession while he waits acceptance by the BBC of The White Van, a \"serial killer comedy in 12 parts\". Leicestershire, which represented the grim and dull English Midlands when Townsend started writing, now stands for Middle England, capital of Blair's political kingdom. Jobless for years, Adrian's dad George (Alun Armstrong) stays in bed all day, taking Prozac, but - in an odd slip of topicality - not Viagra, although he is impotent and under treatment: \"I'm not having those injections in my dick again.\" Pauline Mole (Alison Steadman) is sexually restless, drawn to Pandora's father Ivan (James Hazeldine) who, being a New Labour campaign manager, scatters her with rose petals before they commit adultery. None of this is going to bring down a government, but the targets are the right ones and, while political satire often dates, The cappuccino Years feels sharper on TV than on the page because Townsend's focus is the optimism of those May days. The point has frequently been made in reviews of the brilliant presidential drama The West Wing (Thursday, 10pm, Channel 4) that American television creates political drama in which the processes of democracy are taken seriously, while British shows about politics are gags and satire. Someone using this generalisation in a TV Studies exam would get full marks, but, within the limits of sit-com, The Cappuccino Years is quietly subversive. When Pauline tells her unemployed husband, \"Tony will get you a job\", or David Dimbleby's voice seeps from the Moles' TV set mentioning that this is the largest Labour majority ever, the series captures something of the now painful hopefulness of that election day. You wouldn't, for example, advise Peter Mandelson to fill the spare time he now has by watching this series, unless he wants another reminder of the distance between ambition and reality. Townsend's lines frequently surprise. Ivan's wife knows he's betraying her when she finds a Kit-Kat wrapper in his pocket. You don't understand this until she later explains that the right-on couple have been \"boycotting Rowntrees products since 1979\" because of their fears about cocoa beanfarming. After his mother babysits Adrian's son, she hands him back with the warning: \"Don't put him on the floor - he's pretending it's the open sea.\" Trains and cars are things you want to see coming, but the best dialogue hits you from nowhere, and Townsend's frequently does. A satire of New Labour, The Cappuccino Years also, in one curious way, represents a new BBC. Under John Birt, BBC current affairs presenters were banned from appearing as themselves in comedies and dramas, because of fears that fictionalisation robbed them of authority. For this reason, the headlines were usually read in TV dramas by Pamela Armstron, Jan Leeming, Richard Whitmore, or other former newsreaders. (In the 1993 BBC2 political comedy The Vision Thing, incidentally, the newsreader was played by a then Daily Mirror reporter, Alistair Campbell.) This rule now seems to have lapsed because, in the second episode of The Cappuccino Years, Dr Pandora Braithwaite, now a Blair Babe, is interviewed on the Newsnight set by Jeremy Paxman, who is undone by her brazen sexuality. Paxman exposing Labour MPs as heterosexual on-air - it's about the only thing that doesn't feel accurate in this sparky picture of the Blair Years. \u0095 Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years, Friday, 9.30pm, BBC1 (not Scotland)",

The massacre, the worst in recent months, occurred at El Guetaibia n the Chlef region, 135 miles west of the capital Algiers, between 11pm and midnight on Saturday. \"They cut the throats of 25 people from two extended families,\" a doctor at the hospital in Chatia said. Relatives told the hospital that members of the Islamic Armed Group (GIA) were responsible. Yesterday the security forces were sweeping the area in search of the assailants. The massacre brought the number of people killed in Algeria to more than 90 this month alone, and more than 100,000 since the Islamic insurgency began in 1992 after the military-dominated government cancelled a general election which a radical Islamic party was about to win. Last month 250 were killed during the fasting month of Ramadan, when the violence broke out against after the relatively quiet period which followed a government amnesty. The doctor and staff at the Chatia hospital, where the bodies of the dead were taken, said they were members of the Miloud and Ayad families. They quoted relatives as saying that armed members of the family fired at the attackers in an unsuccessful attempt to repel them. \"The villagers in the area have been asking the authorities to grant them arms for self-defence since 1997, but they got no answer,\" a doctor said. Relatives also told them that the rebels had abducted a girl aged about 20, the doctor added. Most of the violence this month has been around Chlef and Ain Defla, 85 miles west of Algiers, from the capital, and near Medea, 60 miles to the south, traditionally an area controlled by the GIA.",

      "body": "<p>Last November 29-year- old Dido Armstrong and her boyfriend Bob were discussing their day at work. Bob had gone to the office and relaxed with a game of football. Dido had ended up locked in a car boot. </p> <p>\"I was actually tied and gagged,\" she recalls. \"It was pretty hairy. I don't like not being able to breathe and the gag hurt my mouth. And I managed to smash my head on the car jack. There was this massive crunch and I just burst into tears.\" </p> <p>It was all in a day's work, even if the tears and the head-smashing were not in the contract. She had been locked up for the video of Eminem's controversial smash hit Stan, which had heavily sampled her song Thank You. Since then, Dido's career has gone ballistic. Her No Angel album has sold 2m albums in America and 300,000 here since Christmas, and should hit number one next month. And all this before the Islington girl has even released a single. </p> <p>\"I'm not really sure who's buying it,\" sighs Dido, whose Beth Orton/ Sinead O'Connor-like songs allude to betrayal and abortion but have little in common with Eminem's rage-filled rap. \"I mean, I can't exactly hang outside Virgin and look in people's bags. From my American audiences I suspect it's a mixture of families, couples, lots of guys and [she laughs loudly] a posse of Eminem fans looking a bit puzzled.\" </p> <p>So far the British press have been caught on the hop. With Dido away until recently on a much-needed holiday with Bob (\"You've got to get your priorities right\"), the tabloids have resorted to camping outside her house (\"My parents' house too, and I haven't lived there for 14 years\") and gleaning what they can from American reports. They have described Dido as a demure, butter-wouldn't-melt English rose from a privileged background who was \"turned into a superstar by bad boy Eminem\". She finds all this hilarious. \"That's so not me!\" she squeals, in an accent closer to the Arsenal terraces than posh London convent. Her true story is that of a clued-up woman who took on and defeated everything from her parents to the male-dominated pop industry. </p> <p>Dido was born on Christmas Day 1971, which is perfect for pop mythology but tough when it comes to birthday presents (she named June 25 her \"official\" birthday to make up for it). Her father was a publisher, and her mother an unpublished writer who coupled housework with a parallel world of \"scary\" poetic fantasy. The household was odder in that Mrs Armstrong didn't allow visitors and the family didn't own a television. </p> <p>\"Looking back, I think that's why I did music,\" says Dido. \"I'd get home from school and the house would be so quiet.\" Upset that her peers played recorder and she didn't, Dido \"appropriated\" one from the school's lost property cupboard. Against her parents' wishes, she followed her teachers' advice and spent weekends at London's Guildhall College of Music. Music was Dido's only form of expression. She \"didn't say a word to anyone\" for the first six weeks of primary school and - embarrassed about being named after the Queen of Carthage - learned to make friends by living a bizarre double life as \"Claire\". Aged nine, she toured Yugoslavia with a recorder orchestra (\"Do I have the tapes? Yes, in a fuckin' safe!\") but remembers feeling\"terribly left out, younger than everybody else, and homesick\". By her mid-teens, she was rebelling against music, Westminster School and everything else, and was thrown out of the family home. </p> <p>Dido lived with friends, working at a literary agency and doing a law degree by night. \"That comes in handy now. I totally understand the business, much to the annoyance of the business.\" Later she immersed herself in club culture, then eased back out when several of her friends ended up in mental hospitals. </p> <p>\"Did I ever dabble? To be honest I was mixed up at the time and drugs scared me,\" she says. \"I'd smoke a bit and get paranoid. I'm too much of a control freak.\" </p> <p>In her early 20s, Dido finally realised that she wanted to do music but took to singing, the only thing she hadn't learned. Her older brother, Rollo, was forming the now hugely successful dance band Faithless and Dido wanted in. She hung around the sessions, \"playfully manipulating\" her brother into letting her sing backing vocals. But her first record wasn't with Faithless. It was Give Me Life by Mr V, in 1994, done with a \"horrible\" boyfriend, and brings back memories that she still describes as traumatic. Around this time, Dido signed lots of \"stitch-up\" management contracts she would later get out of, and a publishing deal that coincided with bouts of agoraphobia, panic attacks and depression. \"I didn't bank the cheque for ages. I didn't leave the house. My heart was going at 200 beats per minute. I really felt like I was giving away my music. It was the only thing I'd had for my whole life, the only thing that was mine. I lost it.\" </p> <p>At this point she wrote Slide and Honestly OK, songs that are rooted in depression and \"that feeling where you just want to remove yourself from your body, when you just can't take it any more . . . I'd rather not dwell.\" The writing helped. She got out of the house and put together enough songs for an album. From here on in, Dido's life would change. </p> <p>The horrible boyfriend had one plus: he introduced Dido to Bob, oddly enough a lawyer, in a club. The very next day she wrote Here With Me (\"a post-shag song\"), No Angel, Take My Hand and the crucial Thank You. \"I did offer Bob royalties,\" she laughs, \"but he didn't want them. Isn't that sweet?\" </p> <p>She had the songs, some written with Rollo and various mates associated with Faithless, but was wary of the business. Then she got a call from one of the biggest names in the music industry - Clive Davis, head of Arista Records. \"He called up out of the blue,\" Dido says. \"To this day I don't know how he got the demos. When I went to see him at the hotel, there were two DATs on the table, mine and Whitney Houston's. That has an extraordinary effect on someone.\" </p> <p>Davis made Dido an offer she couldn't refuse. She still turned it down. \"I was terrified his company would pay to make an album, not like it and refuse to release it. By this point, I would have been devastated if it hadn't worked out.\" Instead, she signed to Faithless's label, Cheeky. By the time the album was complete, Arista had bought Cheeky - but she had got the space she needed. </p> <p>Then Dido worked, singing in clubs and restaurants across the US for two years (\"It was meant to be three months!\"), before finally getting the breaks. First, Here With Me was used as the theme to Roswell High. Then along came Eminem, who heard Thank You on a tape sent to him by DJ The 45 King. </p> <p>They met the night before the video shoot. She was nervous, because of his reputation and what she mischievously refers to as \"the other things\" (Eminem's history of legal charges involving weapons) but he was \"lovely\". \"Within a minute we were having a laugh and taking the piss out of each other. People confuse him with the characters in his songs. it's like Stephen King. He does some scary shit, and it's warped beyond belief. But it's not real. I got close enough to Eminem to know that he's not misogynist or homophobic.\" </p> <p>Next week, Dido plays her first British gigs. If possible, she'll join Eminem on his UK dates in February. Time is something she doesn't have much of, being shunted around from continent to continent, but she's loving every minute. </p> <p>So far it's a fairytale - she has even healed the rift with her parents - but will Dido be able to sustain her success? She insists she's not that bothered. \"I am ambitious but I'm not consumed by it. All I'm interested in is making a good second album.\" </p> <p>And, after years of drifting, she'd really like a house. \"In fact, I'd just like to own something. Everyone thinks I'm glamorous, rich and famous but all I've got is some recording equipment and a battered old BMW.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Dido plays the Scala, London N1 (020-7833 2022), on February 7 and 8 and tours in April. The single Here With Me is released on February 12; the album No Angel is out now on Arista.</p>",

She was nervous, because of his reputation and what she mischievously refers to as \"the other things\" (Eminem's history of legal charges involving weapons) but he was \"lovely\". \"Within a minute we were having a laugh and taking the piss out of each other. People confuse him with the characters in his songs. it's like Stephen King. He does some scary shit, and it's warped beyond belief. But it's not real. I got close enough to Eminem to know that he's not misogynist or homophobic.\" Next week, Dido plays her first British gigs. If possible, she'll join Eminem on his UK dates in February. Time is something she doesn't have much of, being shunted around from continent to continent, but she's loving every minute. So far it's a fairytale - she has even healed the rift with her parents - but will Dido be able to sustain her success? She insists she's not that bothered. \"I am ambitious but I'm not consumed by it. All I'm interested in is making a good second album.\" And, after years of drifting, she'd really like a house. \"In fact, I'd just like to own something. Everyone thinks I'm glamorous, rich and famous but all I've got is some recording equipment and a battered old BMW.\" \u0095 Dido plays the Scala, London N1 (020-7833 2022), on February 7 and 8 and tours in April. The single Here With Me is released on February 12; the album No Angel is out now on Arista.",

      "bodyText": "The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, broke off peacemaking relations with the Palestinians yesterday in preparation for the prime ministerial election on February 6, which the polls predict he will lose to the hardline Likud leader, Ariel Sharon. The Palestinian Authority president, Yasser Arafat, delivered a blistering attack on Mr Barak's decision to halt \"diplomatic contacts with Arafat and his people\" until the country has voted. Israeli officials said Mr Barak would not have the meeting with Mr Arafat which had been expected to take place in Sweden this week, or any other meeting, until the election was over Mr Arafat said at the Davos economic summit that Mr Barak's government had waged \"a savage and barbaric war\" against the Palestinian people for the past four months. At least 312 Palestinians have been killed in the four months since their intifada erupted. Forty-eight Israelis and 13 Israeli Arabs have been killed in the violence. Israel's elder statesman, Shimon Peres, also in Davos, appealed to Mr Arafat to put aside the years of bitterness and \"walk the last piece of the road for peace\". The goal could be reached within weeks, he said. Mr Barak's office said that although peacemaking contacts would be halted until after February 6, Israeli and Palestinian security officials would continue to hold discussions aimed at \"stopping the violence and thwarting terrorism\". The two sides ended five days of talks in the Egyptian resort of Taba on Saturday with a joint statement saying they were closer than ever to an agreement, but the document fell short of Mr Barak's hope of a campaign-boosting breakthrough. Opinion polls show Mr Barak losing to Mr Sharon by 16 to 18 percentage points. Mr Sharon, who opposes the territorial concessions offered by Mr Barak, dismissed the joint statement as a danger to the state, and said it would not help Mr Barak to win re-election. He accused Mr Barak of trying to boost his election chances with a piece of paper. \"What we see today, to my regret, are steps that pose a danger to the state of Israel,\" he told a campaign event in Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv. Bloodshed continued in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the talks, and at one point prompted the Israelis to suspend them for two days.

It was crowded, there were hundreds of people there in the shopping centre, and right on the square outside the McDonalds they just pulled out axes, knives, hammers, everything. I've never seen such hatred.\" A battalion of CRS riot police and 200 local policemen struggled for more than two hours to end the fighting. Ten gang members were injured, including one who was in a critical condition in hospital last night with a stab wound to the throat. Nearly two dozen youths were arrested. A police spokesman said the youths belonged to rival gangs from low-income housing estates in the suburbs of Mantes-la-Jolie and Chanteloup. The youths had clashed the previous weekend on their home turf, he said, and seemed to have chosen the more dramatic and public setting of La Defense to settle their scores. \"Senseless gang violence is a fast-growing phenomenon in several suburbs, but this is the first time we've seen gangs with enough discipline and organisation to agree to stage a battle on neutral territory,\" he said. \"It is an extremely worrying development.\" The number of 13-18 year-olds serving jail sentences in France has doubled to more than 4,250 in the past eight years, and the number in jail for violent crime has almost tripled, to 3,825. For the past 20 years, murders of adolescents by adolescents have fluctuated from 20 to 40 a year. A senior local official, Simone Mielle, said the fight began at around 4pm, when the district's big-name chain stores and fountain-filled squares were crammed with bargain hunters. Mr Mielle said the youths, most aged between 15 and 18, had arrived on public transport and fled the same way as soon as the panicked shopkeepers began lowering their steel shutters - trapping sales staff and shoppers inside - and squads of CRS officers armed with tear gas moved in. While dozens of police officers waited for the returning youths at Mantes-la-Jolie station until late evening, most of them got off the suburban commuter trains at earlier stations, starting further battles in which six more people were injured and 12 others arrested. Six French teenagers have died in the past four months as a result of gang violence, which has hitherto been confined to the run-down outer suburbs of Paris and other big cities, such as Marseille, Grenoble and Strasbourg. In November a quiet, studious 14-year-old boy called Romuald was shot dead a few yards from his flat in the Paris suburb of Courconnes, the mistaken victim of a gang revenge killing. A 17-year-old, Sami, died from shotgun wounds the following month, prompting Gilbert Conte, the mayor of the northern suburb of Drancy, to demand \"urgent national measures to calm the violence which has taken hold of our young people\". Explanations for the surge in violent teenage crime have ranged from the absence of parental control to the growing influence of drugs and the increasing alienation of young Muslims from the mainstream of French society. Earlier this month Romuald's killers said in court that they had no idea what the rival gangs' original dispute had been about.",

      "body": "<p>Al Gore, not George Bush, should be sitting in the White House today as the newly elected president of the United States, two new independent probes of the disputed Florida election contest have confirmed.</p> <p>The first survey, conducted on behalf of the Washington Post, shows that Mr Gore had a nearly three-to-one majority among 56,000 Florida voters whose November 7 ballot papers were discounted because they contained more than one punched hole.</p> <p>The second and separate survey, conducted on behalf of the Palm Beach Post, shows that Mr Gore had a majority of 682 votes among the discounted \"dimpled\" ballots in Palm Beach county.</p> <p>In each case, if the newly examined votes had been allowed to count in the November election, Mr Gore would have won Florida's 21 electoral college votes by a narrow majority and he, not Mr Bush, would be the president. Instead, Mr Bush officially carried Florida by 537 votes after recounts were stopped.</p> <p>In spite of the findings, no legal challenge to the Florida result is possible in the light of the US supreme court's 5-4 ruling in December to hand the state to Mr Bush. But the revelations will continue to cast a cloud, to put it mildly, over the democratic legitimacy of Mr Bush's election.</p> <p>Some 56,000 so-called \"overvotes\" were examined in the Washington Post survey. All of these ballot papers were ruled to be invalid votes on November 7 because they contained two or more punched holes in the presidential section of the ballot. Twelve Florida counties used voting machines where voting was by punch cards in this way, and eight of them participated in the survey: Broward, Highlands, Hillsborough, Marion, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Pasco and Pinellas.

      "bodyText": "Al Gore, not George Bush, should be sitting in the White House today as the newly elected president of the United States, two new independent probes of the disputed Florida election contest have confirmed. The first survey, conducted on behalf of the Washington Post, shows that Mr Gore had a nearly three-to-one majority among 56,000 Florida voters whose November 7 ballot papers were discounted because they contained more than one punched hole. The second and separate survey, conducted on behalf of the Palm Beach Post, shows that Mr Gore had a majority of 682 votes among the discounted \"dimpled\" ballots in Palm Beach county. In each case, if the newly examined votes had been allowed to count in the November election, Mr Gore would have won Florida's 21 electoral college votes by a narrow majority and he, not Mr Bush, would be the president. Instead, Mr Bush officially carried Florida by 537 votes after recounts were stopped. In spite of the findings, no legal challenge to the Florida result is possible in the light of the US supreme court's 5-4 ruling in December to hand the state to Mr Bush. But the revelations will continue to cast a cloud, to put it mildly, over the democratic legitimacy of Mr Bush's election. Some 56,000 so-called \"overvotes\" were examined in the Washington Post survey. All of these ballot papers were ruled to be invalid votes on November 7 because they contained two or more punched holes in the presidential section of the ballot. Twelve Florida counties used voting machines where voting was by punch cards in this way, and eight of them participated in the survey: Broward, Highlands, Hillsborough, Marion, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Pasco and Pinellas. None of the ballot papers in the survey formed part of any official count or recount. The research shows that 45,608 of the 56,000 ballot papers (87% of the total) contained votes for Mr Gore, compared with 17,098 containing votes for Mr Bush (33%). In 1,367 cases, voters punched every hole except that for Mr Bush. In cases where the voters cast invalid \"overvotes\" in the presidential election, but then cast valid votes in the US senate contest lower down on the same ballot, 70% voted Democrat, Mr Gore's party, and only 24% voted Republican. The disproportion was especially dramatic in Palm Beach, whose butterfly ballot paper interleaved two lists of candidates in such a way as to show Mr Gore's name second on the ballot paper, but to require the voter to punch the third hole to record a vote for him. Though no absolute conclusions can be drawn from the overvotes, the implication that many thousands more invalidated Floridians intended to vote for Mr Gore than for Mr Bush seems hard to resist. The survey also clearly implies that some of Florida's voting machines were inadequate and that many voters were confused by the procedure. In the second survey, the Palm Beach Post examined 4,513 dimpled \"undervotes\" - so named because no hole was punched in the ballot paper - and which were excluded from the November and December manual recount process. In each case, the Palm Beach county canvassing board ruled that no vote had been cast on these ballots but Democratic or Republican observers disputed the ruling. The ballots in the survey had been set aside for a possible court-ordered review that never took place. Of the disputed ballots, some 2,500 had dimples for Mr Gore, while 1,818 had similar marks for Mr Bush. If they had been counted, Mr Gore would have had a net gain of 682 votes. This would have been in addition to a separate net gain of 174 votes from Palm Beach which was disallowed by Florida's secretary of state.",

      "bodyText": "The IRA came under new pressure yesterday to get rid of a substantial amount of weapons in return for a significant security scaledown in Northern Ireland and investigations into the killings of several high-profile nationalists. A deal to salvage the deadlocked political process could be close, but it hinges on whether the Provisionals take one of the most radical steps in their history by agreeing to destroy some guns or seal over a number of their secret arms dumps. Tony Blair is to hold talks with the Irish premier, Bertie Ahern, in Downing Street on Wednesday night, and while sources played down chances of an immediate announce ment, they are cautiously hopeful that there could be a breakthrough soon afterwards. \"We think we're moving forward but you never know if or when it is going happen, because everything has to fit together at once or it might not happen at all,\" said a source. The Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, wants the IRA to make serious moves towards disarmament before he will lift a ban on Sinn Fein's two Stormont government ministers attending cross-border meetings. Republicans want demilitarisation, particularly in the heavily fortified south Armagh area. They are also deeply unhappy with the current legislation for police reform, which they believe does not go far enough. Mr Blair spent more than six hours with Sinn Fein leaders in Downing Street last week, and a similar period of time with them at Hillsborough Castle the week before, much longer than with the unionist delegation. While republicans insist that the negotiations focused mainly on policing and not much progress on the overall situation was made, it is clear that an intense effort is under way to come up with a solution to the arms dilemma. Mr Trimble said yesterday: \"I think the government may have put some proposals to them and I know the Irish government has been putting pressure on them as well. We hope they're going to come back and tell us precisely how they're going to put weapons beyond use in a permanent and verifiable way.\" Sean McManus, a Sinn Fein executive member, dismissed Mr Trimble's comments, saying they bore no relationship to the discussions in which his party was involved and that there was still a lot of work to do on all issues surrounding the peace process. The IRA would never agree to hand over weapons as that would be seen symbolically as surrender, but Mr Trimble said he was unconcerned about the method of decommissioning as long as the guns were rendered permanently unusable. It is believed the British government could signal the opening gambit in a sequence that could take several months in the run-up to the general election, by agreeing to close army installations in Newtownstewart, Co Tyrone, and Magherafelt, Co Londonderry, as well as up to five of the 14 watchtowers in south Armagh. The police ombudsman Nuala O'Loan would have her powers dramatically extended, allowing her to launch retrospective investigations into alleged security force collusion in the loyalist murders of Robert Hamill in Portadown and the solicitors Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson. This would help to finally win over the province's largest nationalist party, the SDLP, which is thought to be on the verge of endorsing the policing reform package and nominating representatives to the new police board. But Sinn Fein leaders have yet to convince the majority of grassroots republicans that these gains would make the unprecedented step of concreting over weapons bunkers or pouring chemicals on their guns worthwhile. The government would also have to tread carefully, weighing up the increasing threat from dissident groups, loyalist and republican, and avoiding the appearance of a trade-off over legal security resources and illegal paramilitary arms. As ever, timing is everything in Northern Irish politics, and much of this would have to happen as simultaneously and seamlessly as possible so that no party seemed to have given ground first.

He wasn't even on drugs. \"Selling what?\" I asked. </p> <p>I was reminded of this moment by <strong> Battle for the Holocaust</strong> (C4, Sat), a brave and accomplished documentary which charted the development of attitudes towards the Holocaust and challenged orthodox opinions about the whole terrible event. Broadcast to coincide with Holocaust Memorial Day and the 56th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, this was one of those programmes which messes with your head just when you think you've finally decided what you think about all the Big Issues in the world. \"Challenging\" doesn't even begin to cover it. </p> <p>Initially, it looked quite pedestrian, with footage of the Holocaust Education Trust leading a day trip to Auschwitz. \"This concept may seem bizarre to some of you,\" the tour guide admitted, but atrocity tourism is hardly unusual. Then came the archive newsreels of the liberation of death and concentration camps. \"There are the bodies and all those guys were dead,\" swaggered the original voiceover. And then came the talking heads who pieced together how the narrative of the Holocaust was created out of the historical events. They explained how the Holocaust as an Event didn't come into being until some 15 years after the war, and years after Germany had been de-Nazified, rehabilitated and recruited as a western ally against a new enemy - the Soviets. (It was conveniently forgotten that it was the Soviets who liberated Auschwitz in the first place.) \"The Nazis won the cold war,\" argued one commentator. It was hard not to agree with her. </p> <p>The controversy then became torrential, with Jewish commentators saying things that would have been unthinkable over on BBC2, home of Spielberg's emotionally manipulative effort The Last Days. They railed against the Holocaust Industry and international Jewish organisations who'd effectively \"extorted\" money from Swiss banks, most of which hadn't reached survivors. They challenged the notion that Jews are morally superior because they're victims, and questioned whether they have a monopoly on suffering. They said things that needed to be said, things that a more emotionally mature world would listen to instead of dismiss as anti-Semitism. </p> <p>That isn't to say these commentators were completely right, but they raised issues which should be talked about sensibly. In truth, what they said made a lot of sense. From being untouchable in one sense, the Jews/Israelis became untouchable in another. Having survived the Holocaust, the Jews who went on to become Israelis became first martyrs then holy people and, as one commentator pointed out, being victims has led them to think - subconsciously or not - they can victimise. It's difficult to argue with people whose views have been hewn by the appalling experiences they had during the war, people whose entire families, neighbourhoods and communities were wiped out - but courageously, Battle for the Holocaust did just that. Including footage of the Palestinian father and son shot dead last year and the murder of Israeli soldiers meant the programme demonstrated that for every death in the West Bank or wherever, Hitler wins another victory. It made clear that for all the Memorial Days and museums, the lessons of the Holocaust have not been learnt, and that sombre recollections mean nothing when genocide continues worldwide. Easy watching, this was not. </p> <p>The glorious <strong> Popstars</strong> (ITV, Sat) continues. Like a minibus crash in Hollyoaks, the carnage on display was magnificent. As the whittling from 33 wannabes to 10 maybes progressed, it became clear that weirdy beardy Darius (\"How much love is in this room?\") was heading for disappointment, as was James, who danced as if he were on day release. The judges - whose qualifications included looking like Frankenstein's wee brother in a lumberjack shirt and managing a rather rubbish pop act - were upset at letting some of their charges go. They needn't be. Rest assured that those who've been banished will pop up as kids' TV presenters and as third engine from the left in a regional tour of Starlight Express. Everyone's a winner.</p>",

That isn't to say these commentators were completely right, but they raised issues which should be talked about sensibly. In truth, what they said made a lot of sense. From being untouchable in one sense, the Jews/Israelis became untouchable in another. Having survived the Holocaust, the Jews who went on to become Israelis became first martyrs then holy people and, as one commentator pointed out, being victims has led them to think - subconsciously or not - they can victimise. It's difficult to argue with people whose views have been hewn by the appalling experiences they had during the war, people whose entire families, neighbourhoods and communities were wiped out - but courageously, Battle for the Holocaust did just that. Including footage of the Palestinian father and son shot dead last year and the murder of Israeli soldiers meant the programme demonstrated that for every death in the West Bank or wherever, Hitler wins another victory. It made clear that for all the Memorial Days and museums, the lessons of the Holocaust have not been learnt, and that sombre recollections mean nothing when genocide continues worldwide. Easy watching, this was not. The glorious Popstars (ITV, Sat) continues. Like a minibus crash in Hollyoaks, the carnage on display was magnificent. As the whittling from 33 wannabes to 10 maybes progressed, it became clear that weirdy beardy Darius (\"How much love is in this room?\") was heading for disappointment, as was James, who danced as if he were on day release. The judges - whose qualifications included looking like Frankenstein's wee brother in a lumberjack shirt and managing a rather rubbish pop act - were upset at letting some of their charges go. They needn't be. Rest assured that those who've been banished will pop up as kids' TV presenters and as third engine from the left in a regional tour of Starlight Express. Everyone's a winner.",

During the second world war, as with many ex-Brigaders, he was banned from enlisting in the army and blacklisted from war work.</p> <p>His family had been too poor to enable him to attend university in the 30s, but he became a mature student at 50 and, having graduated in economics from Hull in 1969, worked as a lecturer in trade union studies at Cauldon College in Stoke-on Trent, later becoming warden and tutor-organiser for the Workers' Education Association at the Wedgwood Memorial College, Barlaston (1972-79). There he pioneered a programme of studies including summer schools for North Staffordshire miners and, for the Open University/WEA, on the renaissance and the reformation.</p> <p>After retiring as warden, he continued organising and teaching adult education programmes. Some reflected his 1930s experiences, such as the successful Spanish civil war summer schools.

His educational achievements were honoured last year with an honorary doctorate from Staffordshire University.</p> <p>In the last phase of Dave's life, he invigorated the pensioner movement. His vision of dignity and independence was built around restoring the link between the state pension and earnings.

A young society photographer working for Queen magazine once approached her at a function. \"My photographers never speak to me at parties,\" she informed him acidly. Soon afterwards the young photographer married Princess Margaret and became the Earl of Snowdon, but for years afterwards Jennifer referred to the royal couple as HRH Princess Margaret and her husband.</p> <p>Her writing style, especially her punctuation, was idiosyncratic. Royal personages were always preceded and followed by semi-colons and the Queen by her own special comma; exclamation marks were preferred to full stops.</p> <p>Betty's appearance was equally singular. By day she favoured Hardy Amies suits like the Queen's, by night pink taffeta ballgowns. She always wore a four-string pearl choker, hard, geisha-esque makeup, and was heavily powdered with her stiff, bouffant, champagne-coloured hair fastened at the back with a velvet bow.</p> <p>Despite constant mentions of \"dear friends\" in her diary she was not a particularly friendly person. This may have been the result of an insecure childhood that she describes without self-pity in her 1992 autobiography, Jennifer's Memoirs. She loved her father, Brian Kemp-Welch, and her twin younger brothers, but she did not get on with her mother, Verena, whom she described as \"very pretty but very immoral\". At finishing school in Brussels, the 12-year-old Betty was advised by her friend Bunty that they could no longer share a room because Mrs Kemp-Welch was living with a man who was not her husband.</p> <p>Betty ran away from home at 16 to work in a hat shop in Knightsbridge, and through family connections she met Barbara Cartland and joined the country house and cocktail party set.</p> <p>In 1932 she married Captain Peter Kenward at St Margaret's, Westminster. Their son Jim was born a year later. But Kenward was a violent alcoholic and they divorced 10 years after.

      "body": "<p>Charles M\u00e9rieux, the French virologist who pioneered the large-scale industrial production of vaccines that have saved millions of lives, has died aged 94. He also played a major role in many of the public health initiatives launched by the World Health Organisation in developing countries.</p> <p>His achievements covered diseases in people and animals. In the late 50s he developed processes for the production of large quantities of the two polio vaccines and made a start on the worldwide eradication of the disease. His organisation, the Institut M\u00e9rieux, refined and cultivated vaccines against rabies, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus and other diseases.</p> <p>Born in Lyon, Charles was the younger of two sons. His father, Marcel M\u00e9rieux, was a microbiologist and former assistant to Louis Pasteur, the scientist who made the connection between micro-organisms and disease. This was the foundation of modern bacteriology.</p> <p>In 1897 Marcel had set up a laboratory to apply Pasteur's ideas to the diagnosis of diphtheria and to prepare serums. He bought 100 acres of land at Marcy l'Etoile, outside Lyon, for pasture for horses used to produce anti-diphtheria serum and for cows that would provide serum against foot-and-mouth disease.</p> <p>The land is now the site of the world headquarters of the M\u00e9rieux organisation, which, after Marcel's death, became a global powerhouse for preventive medicine under Charles's guidance.</p> <p>Yet Charles had intended to pursue a career in medicine rather than in the family laboratory. While his elder brother, Jean, joined their father with a view to succeeding him in the business, Charles studied medicine. But Jean died from meningitis contracted in the laboratory. Charles agreed to join his father after training in microbiological research at the Institut Pasteur, and inherited the laboratory when his father died in 1937.</p> <p>During the second world war M\u00e9rieux created a blood transfusion centre for the French resistance - his wife delivered the plasma to the fighters on her bicycle - and he produced and distributed protein-rich extracts to feed undernourished children.</p> <p>After the war he went to the United States to study advances in purifying blood products from transfusions, and other experiments that were the forerunners of biotechnology. He used this knowledge in planning the institute's future, because the French government had banned commercial laboratories from handling human blood products.</p> <p>On returning to France, M\u00e9rieux concentrated on veterinary medicine and created the Institut Fran\u00e7ais de la Fi\u00e8vre Aphteuse (the Foot-and-Mouth Institute), where, for the first time, the virus was cultured on an industrial scale. The early method of cultivating foot-and-mouth was to apply it to the tongue of a live cow and harvest the multiplied cells from the resulting pustules.

      "bodyText": "Charles M\u00e9rieux, the French virologist who pioneered the large-scale industrial production of vaccines that have saved millions of lives, has died aged 94. He also played a major role in many of the public health initiatives launched by the World Health Organisation in developing countries. His achievements covered diseases in people and animals. In the late 50s he developed processes for the production of large quantities of the two polio vaccines and made a start on the worldwide eradication of the disease. His organisation, the Institut M\u00e9rieux, refined and cultivated vaccines against rabies, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus and other diseases. Born in Lyon, Charles was the younger of two sons. His father, Marcel M\u00e9rieux, was a microbiologist and former assistant to Louis Pasteur, the scientist who made the connection between micro-organisms and disease. This was the foundation of modern bacteriology. In 1897 Marcel had set up a laboratory to apply Pasteur's ideas to the diagnosis of diphtheria and to prepare serums. He bought 100 acres of land at Marcy l'Etoile, outside Lyon, for pasture for horses used to produce anti-diphtheria serum and for cows that would provide serum against foot-and-mouth disease. The land is now the site of the world headquarters of the M\u00e9rieux organisation, which, after Marcel's death, became a global powerhouse for preventive medicine under Charles's guidance. Yet Charles had intended to pursue a career in medicine rather than in the family laboratory. While his elder brother, Jean, joined their father with a view to succeeding him in the business, Charles studied medicine. But Jean died from meningitis contracted in the laboratory. Charles agreed to join his father after training in microbiological research at the Institut Pasteur, and inherited the laboratory when his father died in 1937. During the second world war M\u00e9rieux created a blood transfusion centre for the French resistance - his wife delivered the plasma to the fighters on her bicycle - and he produced and distributed protein-rich extracts to feed undernourished children. After the war he went to the United States to study advances in purifying blood products from transfusions, and other experiments that were the forerunners of biotechnology. He used this knowledge in planning the institute's future, because the French government had banned commercial laboratories from handling human blood products. On returning to France, M\u00e9rieux concentrated on veterinary medicine and created the Institut Fran\u00e7ais de la Fi\u00e8vre Aphteuse (the Foot-and-Mouth Institute), where, for the first time, the virus was cultured on an industrial scale. The early method of cultivating foot-and-mouth was to apply it to the tongue of a live cow and harvest the multiplied cells from the resulting pustules. The work was laborious and produced only small amounts of usable virus. Charles found a more efficient way, by harvesting the cow tongues and using the tissue to form a growth medium that could be used to produce viruses on an industrial scale. When, in the 60s, a foot-and-mouth epidemic threatened livestock in Europe, he organised a \"vaccine barrage\" to stop its spread. The next step was to apply similar techniques to human health. This began with the large-scale production of the Salk polio vaccine, cultivated on tissue from monkeys' kidneys. M\u00e9rieux went on to collaborate on vaccine projects with other scientists like Hilary Koprowski, a virologist with whom he introduced a new rabies vaccine for humans. His vigorous approach to public health campaigns was apparent in 1973 when, in response to a meningitis epidemic in Brazil, he built a plant to produce enough vaccine for 90m Brazilians. Later he designed a portable plant that could fit into a Hercules airplane to treat outbreaks on the spot. M\u00e9rieux's interest went beyond research and development and focused on the social and political mechanisms for delivering vaccines to large numbers of people. He believed that it was not enough to manufacture the vaccines without addressing the logistical problems. In the early 80s he formed a training organisation, Bioforce D\u00e9veloppement, to prepare professionals for public health emergencies. He converted a family property into an epidemiological teaching centre, the first course at which was carried out in collaboration with the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. In 1968 controlling interest in Institut M\u00e9rieux was sold to Rhone-Poulenc, the French pharmaceutical company; the acquisition was completed in 1994. The M\u00e9rieux name has moved into gene therapy through Charles' son Alain, the chairman of Transgene. He is also survived by a daughter, Nicole. \u0095 Charles M\u00e9rieux, virologist and vaccine producer, born January 9 1907; died January 18 2001.",

      "byline": "David Walker",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The theme at the Davos economic extravaganza today and tomorrow is again openness. At the conference last year Tony Blair dedicated the 21st century to winning \"an open world, an open economy, and an open global society\". And open borders? How open is open when the Heathrow immigration officer is demanding the papers of would-be residents whose skin is not quite white?</p> <p>Despite the illiberalism of its response to the growth in asylum-seeking, the Blair government has quietly been trying to ease the passage of \"economic migrants\". These are welcome because, sotto voce, they make the UK more diverse. They are really welcome - this is more politically saleable - because the IT and health sectors need them.</p> <p>The case for migration as put by Barbara Roche, the Home Office minister, is unabashedly utilitarian. Immigration is good for migrants and good for us (and let's draw a veil over the consequences for their home countries). Assisted by the Cabinet Office's performance and innovation unit, her civil servants this week gave her some useful ammunition by doing the immigration sums for the first time*.</p> <p>The UK's foreign-born population pay 10% more to the state than they get back in benefits and services - equivalent to \u00a32.6bn a year net. They push up the rate of economic growth by a finite but hard-to-calculate amount and, among other things, ensure we get treated when we are ill. Nearly a third of UK doctors and 13% of nurses are non-UK born; half the extra NHS staff employed over the past decade qualified abroad.</p> <p>Immigration is now at \"historically high\" levels. Some 150,000 non-EU, non-UK people are expected to arrive in 2001 with a view to long-term residence. The chart shows where migrants come from. Returning UK citizens form the biggest category of long-run settlers, mainly because from 1945 to the 70s the migrant flow went heavily the other way. Of course, many would not consider them to be migrants at all. It has been \"New Commonwealth\" - non-white - immigration that has excited controversy.</p> <p>On the value of individual immigrants the report is not entirely clear. If we are applying an economic calculus, that would favour migrants with skills. Or capital: there has always been significant, largely uncontroversial immigration of people of people who can kick a ball or mobilise a million on the back of official permits and schemes.</p> <p>Labour is making these easier to get though it is unclear whether the government wants permit holders to settle permanently. About 100,000 applications for work permits are expected this year. After four years permit holders are entitled to apply to live in the UK permanently but, in practice, only a fraction do.</p> <p>Officially, migrants include \"working holidaymakers\". These are 17- to 27-year-olds from the Commonwealth who are allowed to stay for up to two years. They are not supposed to work in non-professional jobs but do. Most are white, many are Australian, and without them the pubs of the capital would close down. Up to 15,200 mainly eastern Europeans qualify under the seasonal farm workers' scheme.</p> <p>Getting into the UK if you are in business is relatively plain sailing - though not, it seems, for the Hinduja brothers. There are several business migrant categories - for those establishing a new company, innovating and investing. Only a few hundred a year enter under these schemes.</p> <p>Students with a university place get in automatically but can be stopped if immigration officers think they intend to stay here after completing their course (12% of applications are refused, rising to 20-25% from parts of Asia and Africa). In 1998, 266,000 students were given permission to stay on after their courses ended for further training or to take jobs.</p> <p>Students and Antipodeans are not, however, what the tabloid press nor people at large label migrant - often because they refuse to distinguish between new arrivals and British people of black or Asian descent.</p> <p>Over race, as over the attributes of individual migrants, the Home Office report betrays a certain naivety, perhaps because it was written by civil servants rather than politicians having to deal with racist attitudes at the sharp end. Immigration clearly has never been just about jobs, housing or even cultural enrichment; it is also about identity, race, resentment and (for the right) a potent source of political mobilisation.</p> <p>Still, it is worth getting the facts of the immigration story straight. Theory says migration increases the labour supply, depressing wages while bumping up returns to capital. (That ought to make free marketeers passionate advocates of open borders. To judge from Tory party history, it has not happened.) In fact, there is no evidence of sectors where migrants have supplanted UK-born labour.</p> <p>Instead, migrants are doing well enough to suggest they are bringing something valuable to the party. On average, migrants who work earn rather 12% more on average than the UK-born. Migrants are over-represented in the upper reaches of the income league tables. However, the migrant jobless rate is about one percentage point higher than for the UK-born. Levels of entrepreneurship and self-employment appear to be high among migrants. But that finding may be skewed by the fact that some 150,000 French entrepreneurs have moved to the UK since 1995, many to work in information technology.</p> <p>But if migrants are as beneficial as the evidence suggests why not admit many more of them? Silence from Barbara Roche and the civil servants on numbers. They recommend Whitehall should tidy up the competing jurisdictions of Home Office, employment and trade departments. But the obvious question remains: if 100,000 human imports a year is good for the UK, wouldn't the benefit double at 200,000 a year?</p> <p><b>Useful links</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/ adhocpubs1.html\" target=\"_new\">www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a> <br> Migration, an economic and social analysis</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:david.walker@theguardian.com\">david.walker@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The theme at the Davos economic extravaganza today and tomorrow is again openness. At the conference last year Tony Blair dedicated the 21st century to winning \"an open world, an open economy, and an open global society\". And open borders? How open is open when the Heathrow immigration officer is demanding the papers of would-be residents whose skin is not quite white? Despite the illiberalism of its response to the growth in asylum-seeking, the Blair government has quietly been trying to ease the passage of \"economic migrants\". These are welcome because, sotto voce, they make the UK more diverse. They are really welcome - this is more politically saleable - because the IT and health sectors need them. The case for migration as put by Barbara Roche, the Home Office minister, is unabashedly utilitarian. Immigration is good for migrants and good for us (and let's draw a veil over the consequences for their home countries). Assisted by the Cabinet Office's performance and innovation unit, her civil servants this week gave her some useful ammunition by doing the immigration sums for the first time*. The UK's foreign-born population pay 10% more to the state than they get back in benefits and services - equivalent to \u00a32.6bn a year net. They push up the rate of economic growth by a finite but hard-to-calculate amount and, among other things, ensure we get treated when we are ill. Nearly a third of UK doctors and 13% of nurses are non-UK born; half the extra NHS staff employed over the past decade qualified abroad. Immigration is now at \"historically high\" levels. Some 150,000 non-EU, non-UK people are expected to arrive in 2001 with a view to long-term residence. The chart shows where migrants come from. Returning UK citizens form the biggest category of long-run settlers, mainly because from 1945 to the 70s the migrant flow went heavily the other way. Of course, many would not consider them to be migrants at all. It has been \"New Commonwealth\" - non-white - immigration that has excited controversy. On the value of individual immigrants the report is not entirely clear. If we are applying an economic calculus, that would favour migrants with skills. Or capital: there has always been significant, largely uncontroversial immigration of people of people who can kick a ball or mobilise a million on the back of official permits and schemes. Labour is making these easier to get though it is unclear whether the government wants permit holders to settle permanently. About 100,000 applications for work permits are expected this year. After four years permit holders are entitled to apply to live in the UK permanently but, in practice, only a fraction do. Officially, migrants include \"working holidaymakers\". These are 17- to 27-year-olds from the Commonwealth who are allowed to stay for up to two years. They are not supposed to work in non-professional jobs but do. Most are white, many are Australian, and without them the pubs of the capital would close down. Up to 15,200 mainly eastern Europeans qualify under the seasonal farm workers' scheme. Getting into the UK if you are in business is relatively plain sailing - though not, it seems, for the Hinduja brothers. There are several business migrant categories - for those establishing a new company, innovating and investing. Only a few hundred a year enter under these schemes. Students with a university place get in automatically but can be stopped if immigration officers think they intend to stay here after completing their course (12% of applications are refused, rising to 20-25% from parts of Asia and Africa). In 1998, 266,000 students were given permission to stay on after their courses ended for further training or to take jobs. Students and Antipodeans are not, however, what the tabloid press nor people at large label migrant - often because they refuse to distinguish between new arrivals and British people of black or Asian descent. Over race, as over the attributes of individual migrants, the Home Office report betrays a certain naivety, perhaps because it was written by civil servants rather than politicians having to deal with racist attitudes at the sharp end. Immigration clearly has never been just about jobs, housing or even cultural enrichment; it is also about identity, race, resentment and (for the right) a potent source of political mobilisation. Still, it is worth getting the facts of the immigration story straight. Theory says migration increases the labour supply, depressing wages while bumping up returns to capital. (That ought to make free marketeers passionate advocates of open borders. To judge from Tory party history, it has not happened.) In fact, there is no evidence of sectors where migrants have supplanted UK-born labour. Instead, migrants are doing well enough to suggest they are bringing something valuable to the party. On average, migrants who work earn rather 12% more on average than the UK-born. Migrants are over-represented in the upper reaches of the income league tables. However, the migrant jobless rate is about one percentage point higher than for the UK-born. Levels of entrepreneurship and self-employment appear to be high among migrants. But that finding may be skewed by the fact that some 150,000 French entrepreneurs have moved to the UK since 1995, many to work in information technology. But if migrants are as beneficial as the evidence suggests why not admit many more of them? Silence from Barbara Roche and the civil servants on numbers. They recommend Whitehall should tidy up the competing jurisdictions of Home Office, employment and trade departments. But the obvious question remains: if 100,000 human imports a year is good for the UK, wouldn't the benefit double at 200,000 a year?

But the Ministry of Defence warned that this could lead to holidaymakers blowing themselves up. Dartmoor national park authority has now scrapped a proposed guide containing this toilet tip after the army pointed out that unexploded shells, many a legacy of training for D-day, litter the West Country wilderness. Although there are now only three live firing ranges on Dartmoor, the army has used almost every part of the moor for live ammunition training. John Weir, of the park authority, said it had decided not to go ahead with the guide after the MoD pointed out that digging on the moor was in breach of bylaws. \"We decided not to launch the guide, but would ask people to use their common sense,\" he said. The military have their own methods of avoiding \"collateral damage\" to the landscape. Soldiers are sometimes required to bag their deposits, while large bodies of troops either use portable toilets or resort to metal detectors to sniff out the safest spots for digging. More than three million people visit Dartmoor every year and the Dartmoor Preservation Association has called the scrapping of the guide a \"damning indictment\" of the dangers of military training. The association's chief executive, John Bainbridge, said: \"By the army's own admission, it would take them 100 years to clear up the moor of ordnance, even if they stopped using it tomorrow. \"It's a sad state of affairs.

But that hasn't stopped Royal Mail launching a no-need-to-lick, self-adhesive stamp from today, January 29. </p> <p>Matthew Gibbs, stamp product manager for Royal Mail (and a man clearly feeling the need to justify his job) has voiced his enthusiasm for the invention. \"Small business customers using 100 stamps a week could save a whole working day in a year by switching over to self-adhesive stamps; as the new stamps are quicker to stick for businesses than conventional gummed stamps.\" A surprising, if slightly stupid, contender, then, for the recurring question of \"Where does the time go?\" </p> <p>* More (and arguably better) time-saving techniques can be found at our website of the week, venuefinder.com. The new website for meeting and event organisers helps you save time and money in your search for the perfect venue for your conference, meeting, event, seminar, product launch, training session or big, fat leaving party. </p> <p>There are more than 6,250 listings of meeting venues in the British Isles, which are being continually updated. Hotels, conference centres, castles, museums, racecourses and all sorts of unusual venues are also listed. For last minute requirements or bargain-hunting, the site has special offers and late availability search, by county or region. A unique feature of the site allows users to take themselves through a selection of virtual reality tours of many of the venues - allowing the user to \"walk\" through committee rooms, executive suites and have a general nosy at posh buildings they couldn't ordinarily afford to breathe near. </p> <p>* WPM was delighted to hear news that sultry singer Dido, who recently shot to fame as co-vocalist on Eminem's Stan, used to be a secretary. Treading a more conventional path after leaving school, Dido Armstrong was, for five years, an assistant to Carole Blake of literary agents Blake Friedmann. All this brings hope to the equally talented and doubly sultry WPM, who has yet to be spotted from behind her mountain of paperwork as the superstar of the future, despite many an authentic rendition of Will the Real Slim Shady Please Stand Up? and Who Let the Dogs Out? Convinced she is the next Britney, WPM has resolved to sing louder and more obnoxiously until someone recognises this raw, unhidden talent. </p> <p>* Praise be to that bastion of equal opportunities, the Italian judge. News reaches this very politically correct corner of Europe that we are being too uptight with our sexual harassment laws. No longer, say the Italians, should we see patting the female behind as some sort of pervy penchant of the office letch. No, no. Instead Rome's Supreme Court has ruled that a \"dead hand\" lingering on a female employee's thigh or buttock is not molesting, so long as it is not accompanied by suggestive remarks. </p> <p>Now that that is cleared up, WPM looks forward to upcoming clarifications on the working laws of our Italian cousins. No doubt in future scenarios it will be fine to swipe the inner thigh of one's secretary or stroke the nipple of the office assistant, so long as the caressers keeps their mouths shut in the process.</p>",

Matthew Gibbs, stamp product manager for Royal Mail (and a man clearly feeling the need to justify his job) has voiced his enthusiasm for the invention. \"Small business customers using 100 stamps a week could save a whole working day in a year by switching over to self-adhesive stamps; as the new stamps are quicker to stick for businesses than conventional gummed stamps.\" A surprising, if slightly stupid, contender, then, for the recurring question of \"Where does the time go?\" * More (and arguably better) time-saving techniques can be found at our website of the week, venuefinder.com. The new website for meeting and event organisers helps you save time and money in your search for the perfect venue for your conference, meeting, event, seminar, product launch, training session or big, fat leaving party. There are more than 6,250 listings of meeting venues in the British Isles, which are being continually updated. Hotels, conference centres, castles, museums, racecourses and all sorts of unusual venues are also listed. For last minute requirements or bargain-hunting, the site has special offers and late availability search, by county or region. A unique feature of the site allows users to take themselves through a selection of virtual reality tours of many of the venues - allowing the user to \"walk\" through committee rooms, executive suites and have a general nosy at posh buildings they couldn't ordinarily afford to breathe near. * WPM was delighted to hear news that sultry singer Dido, who recently shot to fame as co-vocalist on Eminem's Stan, used to be a secretary. Treading a more conventional path after leaving school, Dido Armstrong was, for five years, an assistant to Carole Blake of literary agents Blake Friedmann. All this brings hope to the equally talented and doubly sultry WPM, who has yet to be spotted from behind her mountain of paperwork as the superstar of the future, despite many an authentic rendition of Will the Real Slim Shady Please Stand Up? and Who Let the Dogs Out? Convinced she is the next Britney, WPM has resolved to sing louder and more obnoxiously until someone recognises this raw, unhidden talent. * Praise be to that bastion of equal opportunities, the Italian judge. News reaches this very politically correct corner of Europe that we are being too uptight with our sexual harassment laws. No longer, say the Italians, should we see patting the female behind as some sort of pervy penchant of the office letch. No, no. Instead Rome's Supreme Court has ruled that a \"dead hand\" lingering on a female employee's thigh or buttock is not molesting, so long as it is not accompanied by suggestive remarks. Now that that is cleared up, WPM looks forward to upcoming clarifications on the working laws of our Italian cousins. No doubt in future scenarios it will be fine to swipe the inner thigh of one's secretary or stroke the nipple of the office assistant, so long as the caressers keeps their mouths shut in the process.",

Speaking emotionally to a rally of 20,000 people in San Martin Square in central Lima, he promised to lead a government of \"bread and freedom for all Peruvians\". Mr Garcia, who governed Peru from 1985 to 1990, showed he had lost none of his skill at oratory nor his populist touch in almost 10 years of exile in Colombia and Paris. He promised there would be cheap credit for farmers, railed against the excessive phone and electricity bills ordinary people have to pay to the privatised utility companies, and called the tax authority, the Sunat, a \"Nazi police\". Peruvians are sharply divided about Mr Garcia. Elected in a 1985 landslide by the traditional centre-left Apra party, he won approval ratings of more than 90% as the country's youngest president at 35. But his popularity sank as guerrilla violence spiralled upwards and the economy downwards. Many people remember him mainly for food shortages, power blackouts and hyperinflation, which reached 7,000%. The finance system was thrown into disarray when he tried to limit foreign debt payments to 10% of export earnings and attempted, unsuccessfully, to nationalise the banks. In a national opinion poll this month 65% of those questioned said they would never vote for him. Even so, 3,000 supporters turned out at Lima international airport on Saturday to greet him off a commercial flight from Bogota. A band played party songs and many supporters wore headbands reading \"The Apra never dies\" or \"Alan's coming back\". Malvina Correa, who works in a soup kitchen in the city of Callao, was one of those celebrating. \"Alan will give us work,\" she said. \"When he was in government there were food queues but there was work too, while under the Chino [Fujimori] we got nothing.\" Mr Garcia fled Peru in April 1992 when the man who had succeeded him as president two years before, Alberto Fujimori, tightened his grip on power by carrying out a so-called \"auto-coup\" with the backing of the army: congress was closed, supreme court judges were sacked and some political opponents jailed. Mr Garcia hid in a water tank until he could make his way to the Colombian embassy, where he was given asylum. After a corruption scandal broke in September, Mr Fujimori fled to Japan late last year. His right-hand man, the former spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos, is also on the run. The Swiss have found more than $70m (\u00a348m) in accounts linked to him. Mr Garcia faced corruption charges himself, but arrest warrants were lifted last week after judges ruled that they had expired under the statute of limitations. Mr Garcia denied all the corruption charges. Considered a wild-card in the 2001 presidential election, Mr Garcia is on about 10% in opinion polls, vying for second place with two others behind the leading candidate, Alejandro Toledo of the Peru Posible movement, on 32%. He could make it to a second round. Paradoxically, he has improved Mr Toledo's chances by making him look far less radical by comparison.",

It's this: \"Are things better now?\" Decent architecture always improves its neighbourhood, makes people enjoy opportunities and ideas which were hitherto obscure or denied. This version of \"good\" building can take many forms, but there is one thing truly good buildings share: none of them are ever bogus. So, of recent work, there's one outstanding candidate: the new Art Gallery in Walsall is a masterpiece of building design, fantastically refreshing and stimulating in a sometimes weary and cynical world. The architects Caruso St John - together, incidentally, with the gallery's own director - show just what can be achieved with guts and conviction. A simple, honest, generously proportioned, well- detailed handsome building revives a belief, all but extinct in Game Show Britain, that intelligent modern architecture can refresh the body and the spirit of unhealthy, exhausted cities. </p> <p>A similar amount of money produced one of the nastiest buildings in Britain, a vainglorious and preposterous Tudor farce on London's Chelsea Embankment. A folly born of the vanity of financier Christopher Moran, here is sick building syndrome in all its flatulent and insulting pageantry. The money has been spent, but the grotesque, feeble and sickly concept remains shuttered and incomplete. Dull archaeology and a heavy wallet may be reliable supports for a wobbly ego, but they do not necessarily make good buildings. </p> <p>It's a lie and so it's immoral. It has made Chelsea worse, not better. Calculating the values of the lost opportunities on this superb site would be heartbreaking. In contrast to Walsall, this bloated folly diminishes one of the loveliest parts of London. So that's bad.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wonder: Walsall Art Gallery Blunder: Mock Tudor house, Chelsea Embankment There's a morality about \"good\" buildings, a simple test that can be easily applied. It's this: \"Are things better now?\" Decent architecture always improves its neighbourhood, makes people enjoy opportunities and ideas which were hitherto obscure or denied. This version of \"good\" building can take many forms, but there is one thing truly good buildings share: none of them are ever bogus. So, of recent work, there's one outstanding candidate: the new Art Gallery in Walsall is a masterpiece of building design, fantastically refreshing and stimulating in a sometimes weary and cynical world. The architects Caruso St John - together, incidentally, with the gallery's own director - show just what can be achieved with guts and conviction. A simple, honest, generously proportioned, well- detailed handsome building revives a belief, all but extinct in Game Show Britain, that intelligent modern architecture can refresh the body and the spirit of unhealthy, exhausted cities. A similar amount of money produced one of the nastiest buildings in Britain, a vainglorious and preposterous Tudor farce on London's Chelsea Embankment. A folly born of the vanity of financier Christopher Moran, here is sick building syndrome in all its flatulent and insulting pageantry. The money has been spent, but the grotesque, feeble and sickly concept remains shuttered and incomplete. Dull archaeology and a heavy wallet may be reliable supports for a wobbly ego, but they do not necessarily make good buildings. It's a lie and so it's immoral. It has made Chelsea worse, not better. Calculating the values of the lost opportunities on this superb site would be heartbreaking. In contrast to Walsall, this bloated folly diminishes one of the loveliest parts of London. So that's bad.",

Real civilisation always starts in the mind.\" This noble, if controversial statement made by Professor Mohsen Zahran, architect, city planner and head of the nearly complete \u00a3120m Alexandria Library lies at the heart of the decision made 11 years ago to rebuild, in modern guise, the most famous library of all time in one of the world's poorest countries. That was the legendary library founded by Alexander the Great and built by his Greek general, Ptolemy I, King of Egypt and his son Ptolemy II, Shelley's Ozymandias. </p> <p>A showcase of classical learning, the Alexandrian library was originally housed in the Mouseion, an arts and science complex that included laboratories and conservatories, as well as a zoo and the library itself. At its height in the third century BC, the library was said to have housed some 700,000 papyrus manuscripts. Its librarians, among them Archimedes and the astronomer Aristarchus, had collected the works of, among very many others, Plato, Aristotle, Thucydides, Sophocles, Euripides, Hippocrates and Euclid, often when these authors were still at work. As well as storing books, the library acted as a publishing house copying manuscripts for distribution throughout the ancient world. It aimed to house every book, and thus, \"all the knowledge in the [known] world\". </p> <p>Some ambition. But then Alexandria, founded in 322BC, was one of the greatest cities of the classical world. It remained the capital of Egypt until 969AD, although its decline had set in several hundred years before. The library and its fabulous collection was burned several times: accidentally during Julius Caesar's siege of the city in 48BC (it was rebuilt by Mark Anthony who made a gift of 200,000 manuscripts to Cleopatra), in 272AD by order of the Emperor Aurelian, in 391 by Christians enraged by the cult of Seraphis and the pagan books held in the library, and finally, or so it is said, by the Caliph Omar (or Umar) in 638. \"If the writings of the Greeks agree with the Koran they are useless and need not be preserved,\" Omar is meant to have said. \"If they disagree they are pernicious and ought to be destroyed.\" They were used as fuel to heat the city's 4,000 public baths for six months. Of course, this might just have been anti-Arab propaganda. </p> <p>This still goes on in new ways. The new library was first announced in 1989 when the Oslo-based practice Snohetta won an open international competition for its design. It has been described by the Economist as a white elephant, and has been mocked for lacking books - and for a collections policy that seems at best random and at worst desperate. Some authors have already been excluded because of Islamic censorship laws. The shelves can hold up to 8m books, although the library will open with just 400,000. Saddam Hussein gave generously to the library fund before invading Kuwait. </p> <p>Zahran, however, insists that the library is meant to build up its collections over the next 20 years. The building itself - a giant, angled cylinder set behind a great circular wall of inscribed Aswan granite and seeming to rise from the sea - has been likened to a giant colander clashing with a crashed flying saucer. </p> <p>Yet the design is elegant, imposing and, as far as any architecture can be, quite timeless. It has been easy to mock Alexandria's ambition to become a cultural hub once more. Certainly, the city is no longer the vital junction box, connecting Europe, Asia and Africa, that it was 2,000 years ago. Yet if Bilbao can make hay with its Frank Gehry-designed Guggenheim Museum, why can't Alexandria revel in the splendour of its ambitious new library? </p> <p>Despite so many weasel words, the building is imposing. The only partly glazed, 160m diameter slanting roof of the main library and seven-tiered, 2,000-seat reading room is a dramatic sight as construction nears completion. Tilted towards the sea, it has been designed to angle sunlight - at optimum levels throughout the year - down to the desks and shelves set on tiers of galleried floors beneath it. The roof is studded with patterns of green and blue glass and promises delightful plays of coloured light across the oak floors and custom- designed steel and timber furniture. </p> <p>Daylight might be carefully filtered into the depths of the library, a third of which is below ground, but sunlight will flare off its roof at the beginning and end of each day, recalling the way in which the sun appeared to play monumental and deeply significant games - to the ancient Egyptians, at least - with the once shining, limestone-clad pyramids. The height of the building, 31m, is exactly half that of the first great pyramid, at Sakkara. The geometry of the library has been derived in part from a study of ancient Egyptian monuments and in part by that of the bay itself. </p> <p>The library is reached via an arrow-like walkway from the street that whistles past a new planetarium in the guise of an 18m black concrete sphere, banded with blue lights that give it a startling and appropriately sci-fi appearance by night. The walkway pierces the library walls that, with a little styling by artist Jorun Sannes, are composed of 4,600 granite panels inscribed with calligraphy, lettering and braille drawn from around the world. </p> <p>Inside, the great roof is supported by fluted columns rising up to 21m high. It promises to be an impressive sight. For Kjetil Thorsen, one of the architects who has led the design of the project from its inception in 1989, when he was just 31, it should be a vindication of a building that must have seemed little more than a pipe dream for many years. </p> <p>Yet the big question remains: is the library really going to be the great seat of learning and research it is meant to be, or will it be more of a tourist attraction? Censorship is another problem: who can take a library seriously if it sets out limiting knowledge, especially if it is the spiritual successor to Alexander's depot of \"all human knowledge\"? </p> <p>As for the tourist factor, there is nothing wrong with this. The pyramids have long lost their religious purpose (if not their spiritual potency), but they continue to captivate the eyes and wallets of travellers. In Bavaria, Ludwig II was castigated for his lavish expenditure on fairy-tale palaces, yet today Neuschwanstein is Germany's top tourist attraction and a moneyspinner. </p> <p>The Bibliotheca Alexandrina is a brave, dramatic building, refreshingly free from fashionable architectural conceits.

But Vivier's music speaks of different myths. Et Je Reverrai consists of five melodies that the ensemble plays in unison, each short section separated by the sound of a gong. This sparse simplicity of structure, combined with the eastern inflections and echoes of plainchant in the melodies themselves, created an atmosphere of arcane ritual.

Hulse performed in a mysterious language that Vivier created, and her role was as much textural as soloistic. Her voice frequently submerged beneath the opulent instrumental parts, Hulse seemed to be taking part in an obscure, private drama.

Out of an apparent tranquillity loomed grotesque figures: a threatening trumpet line, an insistent violin melody and an obstinate piano solo. </p> <p>The world premiere of Richard Causton's arrangements of two movements from Guillaume de Machaut's Messe de Notre Dame completed the programme. Causton created a decorous reimagination of the 14th-century masterpiece. Splitting his ensemble into two groups, he experimented with timbral and antiphonal effects, while maintaining all of Machaut's original pitches and rhythms.

According to Chater, a major influence is over-confidence. This fault is not confined to experts - it's common to human nature.

      "body": "<p>What keeps a play alive? Often, I suspect, it is something unresolved or contradictory in its content. By strict logic David Hare's The Secret Rapture, first seen in 1988 and dealing with the psychology of Thatcherism, should by now be a bit pass\u00e9. But in Joanna Read's highly welcome Salisbury revival you feel the play survives precisely because Hare is working out his own complex feelings about the interaction between public policy and private behaviour. </p> <p>Hare presents us with two sisters brought together by the death of their bookselling Gloucestershire father. Marion, a junior minister in Thatcher's government, is brisk, focused and irritated by emotional mess.

      "bodyText": "What keeps a play alive? Often, I suspect, it is something unresolved or contradictory in its content. By strict logic David Hare's The Secret Rapture, first seen in 1988 and dealing with the psychology of Thatcherism, should by now be a bit pass\u00e9. But in Joanna Read's highly welcome Salisbury revival you feel the play survives precisely because Hare is working out his own complex feelings about the interaction between public policy and private behaviour. Hare presents us with two sisters brought together by the death of their bookselling Gloucestershire father. Marion, a junior minister in Thatcher's government, is brisk, focused and irritated by emotional mess. Isobel, who runs a commercial design firm with her lover, is humane, altruistic and full of a rather testing moral integrity. The problem the two sisters inherit is their youthful stepmother, Katherine - a relentlessly dependent ex-alcoholic full of a blackmailing helplessness. Who is to take her on?

Or that you're late because only a third of trains in your area are running? Or that when you do finally arrive at the office your health is in jeopardy because the latest floods have turned it into a danger trap? Employees in the UK are likely to have been affected by at least one of these national crises, according to the Institute of Management (IoM). What's more, it has warned British companies to do something about their response to such problems - or face severe consequences. </p> <p>\"Though badly shaken, UK businesses have not been stirred into action to confront emergencies like these in the future,\" states its new report. \"If business leaders continue to ignore voluntary codes on assessing risk, they will face the heavy and costly hand of the law. The current government review on company law is seeking to include recommendations that will bring risk management within the scope of directors' legal duties.\" </p> <p>So what are dutiful managers to do? Drive the trains themselves? Sell petroleum to their secretaries on the black market? Do a sun dance around the desk to send the rain away? \"Their obligations don't reach quite that far,\" says Petra Cook, head of policy at IoM. \"We're simply pointing out that risks to business - as well as dangers to staff - caused directly by employers' reactions to emergencies can be prevented.\" </p> <p>Acceptance that lateness or absence isn't the member of staff's fault is one solution, she says, since failure to do so will almost certainly make them want to quit their job. Consider the flood waters in Kent and Sussex. While they may have subsided, they have left behind a dispute between the local branch of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) and the Royal Mail that could prompt industrial action. After all, the union says that postal workers who couldn't get to work because of flooding - or who needed time off work to bale out their waterlogged homes - were asked to take the time as either holiday or unpaid leave. \"It is absolutely heartless to add to the woes of these people,\" says John Keggie, CWU general secretary. </p> <p>Recruitment consultants including Office Angels claim it is particularly common for secretaries to get an ear-bashing from their manager when they can't get their car through the snow, or fail to purchase the last few litres of petrol in town. \"An increased reliance on support staff means they are sorely missed when absent,\" explains a spokesperson. \"Yet their status - which, in some companies remains low - means that rather than being told this, they are reprimanded.\" </p> <p>Abigail Reiss, a 29-year-old PA, has left two posts for this very reason. \"It's a job-seekers' market for secretaries right now,\" she explains. \"There was no way I was going to hang around and take the blame for natural disasters when I knew I could walk into another job.\" </p> <p>Some companies are believed not only to be putting their business in danger as a result of stringent rules on absence levels - but the staff themselves. Among the latest \"anti-absence\" strategies is paying staff not to stay away and providing a figure for the number of \"acceptable\" days off. \"At best, it is a Dickensian way of managing people and at worst, it puts them at risk by making them attempt to travel when there are dangers involved,\" says John Richmond, a business psychologist specialising in absenteeism. </p> <p>Particularly at risk during times of disaster are the fast increasing numbers of support staff who drive company cars. Whether they're used for getting to work or travelling during the working day, the statistics are grave: two-thirds of all company-owned vehicles are involved in some kind of accident each year - a far higher figure than for owner- drivers. Of course, these accidents aren't all a result of streets turning into rivers and tiredness caused by ensuing traffic jams. Nevertheless, many are a result of staff feeling obliged to use their cars, irrespective of conditions. </p> <p>In 1999, two directors of a transport company were convicted for being indirectly responsible for a fatal accident in which one of their drivers fell asleep at the wheel. The message is clear: employers must carry out full risk assessments if they want to avoid the risk of prosecution. \"Nobody would dream of giving an employee a potentially lethal piece of machinery to operate without providing training or warnings,\" James Sutherland, chairman of the Fleet Driver Training Association, recently told People Management magazine. \"Yet how many companies are prepared to hand out the car keys without a second thought?\" </p> <p>Michelle Jones, a 24-year-old administration assistant, left her job as a result of the rail crisis late last year. \"I liked the job, but I couldn't hack the journey. It went from being 30 minutes to 90 for several weeks. I opted for a post nearer to home,\" she says. </p> <p>Although it is impossible to blame the employer in this case, the IoM says companies have responsibilities here, too. \"In an age of advanced communication, a vast number of PAs and secretaries can feasibly work from home,\" explains Ms Cook. \"If employers enabled secretaries to do this in times of national disaster, the risks to everyone involved would be a lot less.\" </p> <p>Andrew Oswald, professor of economics at the University of Warwick, agrees. \"Our latest survey found that workers in the UK are among the most unhappy in the developed world and that among the explanations for that is \"commuting time\". In other words, those who commute long distances are a lot less contented and a lot more likely to resign.\" </p> <p>In fact, several studies show that employers should not consider the move to allow secretaries to work from home as an unfortunate reaction to emergency, but as a positive move. Flexible workers have repeatedly been found to be 60% more efficient than their office-based counterparts. </p> <p>\"I have a computer, a phone, access to email and am able to do my job as well as in the office,\" says Laura Williams, a 32-year-old PA. \"The people I deal with over the telephone do not know whether I'm sitting in the office in Waterloo or on my kitchen table in my home in Kilburn.\" </p> <p>Temporarily working from home can, according to the IoM, even be a life-saver for secretaries. \"It sounds dramatic, but natural disasters such as storms or flooding increasingly affect office buildings,\" explains Cook. \"If a PA, for instance, enters the office in the morning and turns on a light and fuses herself, her life will be at risk. If, on the other hand, the employer carries out a risk assessment first, danger is avoided. There are endless examples.\" </p> <p>Making this need more urgent still is the fact that employers who fail to confront the possibility of such injuries and deaths may soon find themselves in trouble. Not only will the offence fall under legislation that may be brought in on risk management, but more seriously, it will be affected by the proposed new offence of \"corporate killing\". </p> <p>This legislation, which is part of the government's commitment to improving health and safety at work, would make directors personally responsible for causing injuries and deaths through gross breaches of health and safety law. </p> <p>At present, a company can be found guilty of manslaughter only if the prosecution can show a single individual was directly to blame. This means that while more than 3,000 people have been killed in the workplace in the past decade - many following national disasters - there have been only three successful prosecutions. When it comes to serious injuries at work, the figures are even more worrying - out of nearly 24,000 reported each year, only 11% are even investigated by the Health and Safety Executive or authorities such as councils. Barely one in 100 lead to prosecutions. </p> <p>The TUC, which has pushed hard for the reform, claims: \"It's high time that serious failings of organisations causing death should result in long prison sentences for those responsible.\" </p> <p>National upheaval is not only becoming more common; it is becoming less surprising.

Why this had to change is unclear - perhaps people don't want sperm on the posters in Bolton - but it indicates better the biological nature of Lewis's acerbic comedy for a quartet of actors plus a supporting cast of thousands of the little blighters. Tinkering with the title just leads one to suspect that Misconceptions has been misconceived. </p> <p>The fertile theme is infertility, as experienced by an intellectually overstimulated, middle-class couple who aren't growing any younger or any fonder of each other.

      "bodyText": "The original title of David Lewis's play was Sperm Wars. Why this had to change is unclear - perhaps people don't want sperm on the posters in Bolton - but it indicates better the biological nature of Lewis's acerbic comedy for a quartet of actors plus a supporting cast of thousands of the little blighters. Tinkering with the title just leads one to suspect that Misconceptions has been misconceived. The fertile theme is infertility, as experienced by an intellectually overstimulated, middle-class couple who aren't growing any younger or any fonder of each other.
