      "bodyText": "Uefa is to take control of negotiations with the European Commission over the future of the transfer system, after a climbdown by Fifa yesterday averted a major split in world football. In a hard-hitting meeting in Zurich, Fifa acceded to Uefa demands that it withdraw a controversial document outlining its proposals for a new transfer system and allow European football's governing body to assume full control of how the system can be amended to comply with European labour laws. The Fifa president Sepp Blatter was told by Uefa's president Lennart Johansson that unless Uefa's demands were met and the EC notified that the document would be withdrawn, Uefa would open direct negotiations with the EC and introduce its own transfer rules and regulations. Yesterday's meeting between Blatter and a Uefa delegation lasted just over two hours and left the top man in world football in no doubt that unless he conceded, relations between Fifa and Uefa would be irreparably damaged. The meeting was called after Fifa unilaterally submitted its own transfer proposal - that players should be allowed to move on three months' notice - to the EC last week, causing widespread anger within European football and prompting rumours of a possible split. Blatter apologised to the Uefa delegation and agreed to the formation of a new task force on the transfer issue which will be made up of Uefa's vice-president Per Omdal and chief executive Gerhard Aigner as well as Fifa's general secretary Michel Zen Ruffinen. In another major climbdown, Fifa has agreed that Omdal will have the final say on all matters and that nothing can be agreed unless it is rubber-stamped by him. Omdal, who is also president of the Norwegian FA, is a close ally of Aigner and a firm believer in Uefa's position on what shape the transfer system should take. The outcome of yesterday's meeting leaves Uefa firmly in the driving seat on the transfer issue and is a major victory for the organisation after its recent duel with Fifa. Even though both organisations attempted to paint the row as a spat within the football family and merely a mistake by Fifa, the outcome highlights the economical and political clout of the European game and its overall importance to world football. Much behind-the-scenes work has been carried out by Premier League officials, who enlisted the support of Tony Blair and other European politicians to bring pressure on Fifa and ensure the Uefa line would succeed. Fifa and Uefa also agreed that a joint document submitted by both of them last October would form the basis of future negotiations for the drawing up of proposals. Blatter admitted yesterday that he had made a mistake. He added: \"There has been a lot of trouble concerning the non-paper we sent to the EU. A lot of noise has been made in the media and the football family. But we have settled our differences, and negotiations with the EU will return to those based on the original document submitted on October 31.\" The new Uefa-led task force will meet next Tuesday to refine its proposals before meeting the EC next Wednesday. It will concentrate on two major points contained in the Fifa document that caused so much anger within European football. The first is about contractual stability and ensuring that players honour contracts for longer than three months, as initially proposed by Fifa. Second, Uefa wants to see a better compensation system than the one proposed by Fifa. Uefa's director of communications Mike Lee said: \"Contracts and compensation for us are sources of priority. \"We are looking forward now. There are no recriminations here; clearly Fifa made a mistake, and we are moving forward on a constructive basis.\"",

I spent four months in Sydney, travelled anti-clockwise around the coast and came back again for two weeks before flying out on the day the Olympics started. </p> <p> The last place I stopped was in Byron Bay for 10 days to attempt to learn to surf while staying at the local campsite at Clarke's beach. I'd needed to get to Sydney pretty fast and so was chuffed when some guy called Shaun had placed an advertisement up saying he needed a driving/petrol share for a straight 10 hour drive through the night to the Blue Mountains. </p> <p> Shaun had been visiting his son for the weekend and had to be back at work on Monday morning. After I'd done a three hour shift at the wheel stuggling not to nod off we got to his house at 5am where he said we could stay for a couple of days for $15. </p> <p> When we got there he just showed us the three bed 'dorm' and when we got up the next day the house was deserted. The cooking gas had run out, we had no food and outside there was just a bunch of smashed up cars and two big dogs. Nice. We spent the day smoking out the house trying to start a fire and drinking Milo. </p> <p> Then Scott got back from an early morning trek. Is this the same guy? He was about 40, American, and never stopped talking. I can't believe Shaun has let him stay there this long as he annoyed the hell out of him and us. 'So, is Scotland an Island?', 'Do you guys get American movies in England?', ' What's the difference between the UK and Great Britain?', 'Is John Major still the prime minister', and on and on. </p> <p> Shaun was a nice guy but he seemed overworked. He cooked us food on the fire when he got home and advised us to spend the night sleeping on the floor in the living room as it was so cold. We decided to head to <strong>Katoomba</strong> the next day as it rained constantly and was freezing at that time. Shaun didn't have a car then and when he slept in and missed his lift to work the next day we too had to trek down the train line. </p> <p> Sorry to talk at you about something you've already done but your account of Katoomba and Shaun's house really made my day. I hope all goes well for you, and it'd be great to know if we've got the same Scott. </p> <p> See you later, </p> <p>Michael.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There is so much more to becoming an expert skier than simply cruising down the pistes. In fact, the amount of time actually spent making turns is usually a tiny proportion of the skier's day. As well as learning the techniques of skiing, all skiers have to learn how to manoeuvre around the mountain. This includes climbing uphill, riding lifts, and propelling themselves along flat sections. </p> <p><strong> Climbing uphill</strong> </p> <p> On the nursery slopes, before they ever ride a lift, all novice skiers are taught how to side-step. But so long as the gradient is not too steep, there is a much quicker way to climb uphill: the \"herringbone\" (the name comes from the tracks it leaves in the snow). </p> <p>You set off up the hill in a \"backwards snowplough\" position; the tails of your skis should be together, while the tips, are facing up the hill and pointing apart. Keep your feet fairly wide apart (so your ski tails don't cross) and your skis tilted on to their inside edges (so they don't slip backwards). Then, you'll be able to step quickly uphill, using your ski poles to support you. </p> <p><strong> Getting along the flat</strong> </p> <p> There are two ways to propel yourself along a flat section: poling and skating. Poling involves pushing backwards with both poles simultaneously. But you'll get more power into it if you bend forwards at the waist as you follow through on each push. </p> <p>Skating is a movement very like ice-skating or in-line skating, and is also similar to the herringbone movement described above. Once again, make sure you push off an edged ski, and watch your ski-tails don't cross. Most experts use a mixture of poling and skating to negotiate flat sections, spreading the work between the arms and the legs. </p> <p><strong> Riding lifts</strong> </p> <p> The easiest form of mechanised uplift is the rope tow. Simply tighten your grip, hang on and let it drag you up. But a rope tow is unsuitable for longer or steeper slopes. Soon, you'll graduate to a chairlift. Getting on is easy: just sit down as it comes up behind you. But getting off requires more of a knack: you need to stand up forwards, as if getting out of a chair. And you have to time it right; too late, and you'll drop on to the exit ramp from a height of a metre or more. </p> <p>Apart from rope tows, there are two other types of \"surface lifts\" or \"drag lifts\" (those which drag you up on your skis): button lifts and T-bars. Button lifts (also known as Pomas, after the main brand) are for one skier. The button, a plastic disk about the size of an old vinyl LP, goes between your legs, and you hold on to a central pole. Some Pomas can take off very suddenly with a jerk as you get on; make sure you watch how it affects other skiers before you get on. </p> <p>A T-bar is shaped like an upside-down letter \"T\", and caters for two passengers: each rides either side of the central vertical. This is easy enough, unless the two skiers are of different heights or weights. A lone skier can ride a T-bar, but it takes some practice. Both button lifts and T-bars are a nightmare for snowboarders. Pomas tend to be commonly seen in French resorts, whereas T-bars are more popular in Switzerland and Austria. In North America, surface lifts are rarely found - chairlifts abound. </p> <p> <strong> Tight situations</strong> </p> <p> Once you start to really explore the mountain, you'll eventually find yourself faced with a slope that goes beyond your ability, because it's too steep, narrow, or icy. Many inexperienced skiers remove their skis at this point and try to walk down. Do not do this, unless as a last resort - ski boots are ill-equipped enough for walking on the flat; on a steep slope, they'll merely increase the likelihood of you becoming a projectile. </p> <p>If you can't make turns, you should \"side-slip\" down the slope, controlling your rate of descent by changing the edge angle of your downhill ski, using your knee. Tilting the ski will slow you down, flattening it will speed you up. And try to learn \"directional side-slipping\", where you slide diagonally forwards (by leaning slightly forwards) or diagonally backwards (by leaning slightly backwards). </p> <p>If you're faced with a cliff or forest, with no space to make a turn, but you have plenty of room behind you, the \"kick turn\" will come into play. It involves kicking your downhill ski forwards, pivoting it on its tail until it's facing backwards, and then pulling the other ski around. Thus, you can turn through 180 degrees without actually going anywhere. It sounds and looks complicated, but is not difficult to learn with some practice. It is such a convenient manoeuvre for coping with advanced ski-runs that you should ask an instructor to teach it to you at your local dry ski slope. </p> <p>Martin Bell is running ski courses for intermediate skiers this season in Vail &amp; Breckenridge, Colorado.

The essential requirement for each visitor is a tourist visa which is stamped on entry and exit from Cuba. They are obtainable from the Cuban embassy or can be more easily purchased through a tour operator - I found Journey Latin America to be very useful and helpful in this regard. You should allow at least one month to obtain the visa. However, do remember that, due to the embargo, credit cards issued from US companies are not accepted in Cuba, although everything you pay for will be charged in US dollars. <br>Julian Clifton</p> <p>\u0095 The Cubans are aware of past problems encountered when entering the USA with a Cuban stamp in your passport, and to this end won't (or shouldn't) stamp it - that is if you're travelling to Cuba as a tourist. Instead, a 'tourist card' will be issued by your travel agent/tour operator before you leave, costing \u00a315, which is valid for one month. The only problem with a tourist card is that it's a small piece of paper, and therefore quite easy to lose. A stamp can sometimes be put in your passport when changing money, but these are generally illegible. To be fair, the US are far more liberal now, at least in terms of foreigners arriving with Cuban stamps in their passports. The worse that will happen is that you'll be delayed for half an hour or so for routine questioning. <br> Sco</p> <p> \u0095 I visited Havana in 1993, and New York in 1994 without any trouble, collecting entry stamps in my passport on both occasions.

More often than not, the officials there did not bother to stamp passports, though mine was stamped a couple of times; in fact, some of my fellow travellers had to request a stamp so as to show off that they had been to Cuba. In 1999 I paid a visit to the US and the immigration officials showed no special interest in me. <br>Asher Cashdan</p> <p> \u0095 I visited Cuba and had my passport stamped on the way in and on the way out and have since been to San Francisco and New York with no problems whatsoever.

      "body": "<p>Roncevalles is the cradle of heroes, and I felt a complete fraud. I was setting out to ride 500 miles across Spain on a pilgrimage and I could not ride a horse, had never been to Mass and could not even speak Spanish. </p> <p>This great pass of the Pyrenees is the traditional entry point for pilgrims from France and the setting for the chivalrous medieval epic, The Song of Roland. It was here, on a bright morning last summer that we took delivery of two horses. I watched my girlfriend, Becca, an experienced horsewoman, saddle up her horse and did my best to copy her under the withering gaze of the Spanish horse dealer. The trip had been my idea, and yet I began to realise that not only was I mentally unprepared, I was physically unfit and spiritually unworthy. If God didn't kill me, my horse would. </p> <p>The Camino de Santiago, or Way of Saint James, is not one but a multitude of routes that meander across Europe to the Shrine of St James the Greater in Santiago de Compostela in the region of Galicia, north-western Spain. It is easier to picture it as a series of rivers flowing into one another until they reach the city. </p> <p>The major route is the Camino Frances, or French Way, that takes pilgrims over the Pyrenees and across the north of Spain. Villages, towns and cities were constructed along the way as it has carried a billion people to and from one of Europe's principal shrines during the course of its 1,000-year history. The camino is a path in the most spiritual sense of the word. To the true believer, a pilgrimage begins at his own doorstep and the path is viewed as a spiritual extension of the aisle of Santiago's cathedral itself. </p> <p>We made our way down through the foothills of the Pyrenees, along tiny paths in pine forests and down single tracks through small villages. Those first few days were a blur, as we struggled to get to grips with the practicalities of the trail: finding places to camp, food for ourselves and the horses, and places to wash. We didn't have much time to ourselves, but all that changed in Pamplona. This was the Spain I knew. I had run the bulls here years ago during the fiesta of St Fermin and seen my first pilgrims, who looked all the more angelic through the haze of a sangria hangover. </p> <p>We galloped along the city walls, underneath the ramparts, up to the gate and across the drawbridge. There is not a better sound in the world than horse hooves on a drawbridge - it felt heroic, outrageously romantic and, above all, perfectly Spanish. People stopped to watch: mothers leaning from balconies called out to their children; children ran to get their friends. The sound, as we clattered along the polished cobblestones through narrow streets, drew men out of the bars, caf\u00e9s and barber shops. </p> <p>In that moment it became clear, from the expressions of those in the crowd, that we were doing something very special, far larger than ourselves, that touched a very deep chord in Spain. They didn't see me, they saw 1,000 years of pilgrims, romance, and legend; and I felt like a two-bit actor unfit for the starring role. </p> <p>It was our first inkling of the importance and pride that those who live along its route invest in the Camino. It is not merely a path, it is holy ground. The generosity we were shown was staggering, and we found it hard to pay for anything. Instead, they asked us to light a candle for them when we reached Santiago. </p> <p>As we covered more ground, our confidence grew and we found a rhythm to our days. We meandered through the low hills, past vineyards and almond groves, along roads and narrow paths perched between cliffs of wild honeysuckle and dog rose, above seas of grain. Each morning we would break camp, fill up on coffee and fruit and walk the horses till we had all limbered up. We would then ride till lunch, pick up some more supplies and find some shade to sit out the worst of the day's heat. </p> <p>Saddles would be removed, the horses would graze and we would sleep and read. At about 4pm, we would start up again, ride for a few more hours and try and find a place to camp by 7pm - this was the most difficult part of the day. The camp had to be close to water and have enough space to pitch the tent and graze the horses. As a result, we often found ourselves in churchyards or on village commons. </p> <p>We encountered the most beautiful church of the entire pilgrimage at San Juan de Ortega. It was our second week, and we were coming through the forests of the Montes de Oca and riding before a massive storm front that was bearing down on us from the south. When the wind finally hit, we thought the forest was on fire, but the yellow smoke that filled the air was pine-pollen. The air was thick with it, and when the rain came the path turned into a yellow river, and everything smelt of resin. </p> <p>We reached San Juan - a small collection of houses around a monastery and a church - as the rain stopped, made camp in a field beneath a large oak and ran to Mass. The Romanesque church housed the tomb of St John of the Nettle, who had earned his name clearing the path we had just come down. Painted dragons fought on the ceiling, a statue of St John lay under an elaborate stone canopy, or baldachino . The small priest stood before a Gothic shrine, a gift from Isabel la Catolica herself, lit by the evening sun through the alabaster windows. </p> <p>With the horses safe in an enclosed field, this was our first chance to have a drink with some other pilgrims we had seen along the way and put names to faces already familiar to us. There was the Spanish merchant seaman, the sole survivor of a shipwreck, who had vowed to the Virgin that he would walk forever for Her if he survived. This was his second Camino; he had been to Rome twice and was setting out for Jerusalem next year. </p> <p>There was a Flemish couple who wanted to give thanks for 30 years of marriage, and ask for 30 more. There were also a surprising number of Brazilians whose pilgrimage was their first time abroad. But the largest number were the Germans, who would sleep till three or four in the morning and then head off, finishing their day's walking before lunch so that they could claim the best beds in the refugios . </p> <p>The dramatic scenery is seeded with stories of daring deeds: El Cid fought here, Charlemagne there - every village had its story. Being a pilgrim is good, but being a knight is better. Santiago knew this and chose to be both. He either appears as the humble pilgrim with staff, scrip and scallop shell, or as the matamoros - the killer of Moors, upon a white charger hacking a swathe through the infidel ranks. </p> <p>We carried on through Burgos, Fromista, Sahagun and up into the mountains beyond Leon. This was the Camino at its best. Wrapped in fleeces and thermals, we climbed through Alpine meadows, past abandoned villages and into another century. We saw pallozas - circular huts of dry-stone wall and thatch that haven't changed design since Neolithic times. We cantered along cart-tracks deep in the gloom of ancient oak forests and swam beneath waterfalls in the gorges, on our way to the monastery at Samos. We went to early morning mass and wandered around the monastery that was wrapped in fog and darkness. </p> <p>The end was sudden. We awoke one morning in a forest campsite, collected water from a nearby well, saddled the horses, and by noon we were in Santiago: the most beautiful cathedral I have ever seen; the pilgrims' mass; familiar faces from the trail; the huge incense burner, the botafumeiro , arcing comet-like over our heads. That evening, our horses in stables, we went out to dinner with our fellow pilgrims and ate like kings. </p> <p>The next, day I went back to the cathedral by myself and climbed down into the crypt, a simple stone chamber that supported all that was above it, in terms of both structure and faith. The whole Camino, every church, village and signpost pointed to this, at the bottom of some small worn steps. All my effort had been to get here, this exact spot. It was everything I had expected. </p> <p><strong> When to go</strong> </p> <p>The coolest and quietest time to travel on the Camino is April to June or mid-September to November, though it can be very rainy.

      "bodyText": "Roncevalles is the cradle of heroes, and I felt a complete fraud. I was setting out to ride 500 miles across Spain on a pilgrimage and I could not ride a horse, had never been to Mass and could not even speak Spanish. This great pass of the Pyrenees is the traditional entry point for pilgrims from France and the setting for the chivalrous medieval epic, The Song of Roland. It was here, on a bright morning last summer that we took delivery of two horses. I watched my girlfriend, Becca, an experienced horsewoman, saddle up her horse and did my best to copy her under the withering gaze of the Spanish horse dealer. The trip had been my idea, and yet I began to realise that not only was I mentally unprepared, I was physically unfit and spiritually unworthy. If God didn't kill me, my horse would. The Camino de Santiago, or Way of Saint James, is not one but a multitude of routes that meander across Europe to the Shrine of St James the Greater in Santiago de Compostela in the region of Galicia, north-western Spain. It is easier to picture it as a series of rivers flowing into one another until they reach the city. The major route is the Camino Frances, or French Way, that takes pilgrims over the Pyrenees and across the north of Spain. Villages, towns and cities were constructed along the way as it has carried a billion people to and from one of Europe's principal shrines during the course of its 1,000-year history. The camino is a path in the most spiritual sense of the word. To the true believer, a pilgrimage begins at his own doorstep and the path is viewed as a spiritual extension of the aisle of Santiago's cathedral itself. We made our way down through the foothills of the Pyrenees, along tiny paths in pine forests and down single tracks through small villages. Those first few days were a blur, as we struggled to get to grips with the practicalities of the trail: finding places to camp, food for ourselves and the horses, and places to wash. We didn't have much time to ourselves, but all that changed in Pamplona. This was the Spain I knew. I had run the bulls here years ago during the fiesta of St Fermin and seen my first pilgrims, who looked all the more angelic through the haze of a sangria hangover. We galloped along the city walls, underneath the ramparts, up to the gate and across the drawbridge. There is not a better sound in the world than horse hooves on a drawbridge - it felt heroic, outrageously romantic and, above all, perfectly Spanish. People stopped to watch: mothers leaning from balconies called out to their children; children ran to get their friends. The sound, as we clattered along the polished cobblestones through narrow streets, drew men out of the bars, caf\u00e9s and barber shops. In that moment it became clear, from the expressions of those in the crowd, that we were doing something very special, far larger than ourselves, that touched a very deep chord in Spain. They didn't see me, they saw 1,000 years of pilgrims, romance, and legend; and I felt like a two-bit actor unfit for the starring role. It was our first inkling of the importance and pride that those who live along its route invest in the Camino. It is not merely a path, it is holy ground. The generosity we were shown was staggering, and we found it hard to pay for anything. Instead, they asked us to light a candle for them when we reached Santiago. As we covered more ground, our confidence grew and we found a rhythm to our days. We meandered through the low hills, past vineyards and almond groves, along roads and narrow paths perched between cliffs of wild honeysuckle and dog rose, above seas of grain.

      "body": "<p>Granada is world famous as the place the Moors sought the shade of their flowering water gardens in order to escape the broiling heat. So to suggest the region as a great place to go skiing is to invite a fair amount of scepticism. </p> <p>But if you ignore complaints that the Sol y Nieve resort in the Sierra Nevada is not the prettiest, and scuff your heels at the snobs who look down from their lofty Alpine heights, then a good time can be had by all. </p> <p>Any doubts I had as to the potential of the resort vanished as I rode the telecabin to Borreguiles, swaying up the sheeted white to the jagged-toothed peak of Veleta. It's strange to stand amid all that snow gusting around the twin-domed observatory, looking down on the hard rock browns of the Vega of Granada. And when you catch an occasional glimpse of Africa's Rif mountains, or the sunset goes blood red, you breath in the sheer romance of skiing in Spain. </p> <p>Sol y Nieve resort has its drawbacks. Prado Llano, the central town, was built to serve skiing, so it is thoroughly modern and lacks the charm or character of a real mountain village. It's really a collection of shops and apartments, built on top of an underground car park. But it boasts something few Northern resorts can: almost constant sunshine, which in March turns the slopes into a beauty contest of bikinis and T-shirts. Indeed, with a season that can stretch from the end of November until May 3 it's the longest in Europe. </p> <p>The Sierra's gentle slopes and wide runs make it good for beginners and intermediate skiers, not to mention noisy snowboarders in those irritating clown hats. When they are all open, the total length stretches to 62km. </p> <p>If the snow fails, and even if it doesn't, Granada is only half an hour away. In winter, there are few lovelier sights than the Alhambra's delicate red brown walls, etched against a towering backdrop of hard white. </p> <p>Then there is the sea and the prospect of swimming in the morning and skiing in the afternoon. The coastal towns of Motril and Almu\u00f1eca are just over an hour away, while after 1pm you can ride to the top of the mountain for \u00a312. </p> <p> <strong> How to get there</strong> </p> <p> Packages are not cheap compared with Andorra. Try JMC (0870 6075085, from \u00a3389pp per week half board). Exodus (020-8675 5550, <a href=\"mailto:sales@exodustravels.co.uk\">sales@exodustravels.co.uk</a>) is running a brand-new four-day multi-activity holiday for confident skiers, involving ski mountaineering, skiing, mountain biking and canyoning for \u00a3650 plus Pta30,000 for food and lift pass. easyJet (<a href=\"http://www.easyjet.com\">www.easyjet.com</a>) flies London Luton to Malaga from \u00a365 return </p> <p> <strong> Equipment</strong> </p> <p> A six-day pass costs around \u00a375, and hire of skis, boots and poles from around \u00a335 per week.

      "bodyText": "Granada is world famous as the place the Moors sought the shade of their flowering water gardens in order to escape the broiling heat. So to suggest the region as a great place to go skiing is to invite a fair amount of scepticism. But if you ignore complaints that the Sol y Nieve resort in the Sierra Nevada is not the prettiest, and scuff your heels at the snobs who look down from their lofty Alpine heights, then a good time can be had by all. Any doubts I had as to the potential of the resort vanished as I rode the telecabin to Borreguiles, swaying up the sheeted white to the jagged-toothed peak of Veleta. It's strange to stand amid all that snow gusting around the twin-domed observatory, looking down on the hard rock browns of the Vega of Granada. And when you catch an occasional glimpse of Africa's Rif mountains, or the sunset goes blood red, you breath in the sheer romance of skiing in Spain. Sol y Nieve resort has its drawbacks. Prado Llano, the central town, was built to serve skiing, so it is thoroughly modern and lacks the charm or character of a real mountain village. It's really a collection of shops and apartments, built on top of an underground car park. But it boasts something few Northern resorts can: almost constant sunshine, which in March turns the slopes into a beauty contest of bikinis and T-shirts. Indeed, with a season that can stretch from the end of November until May 3 it's the longest in Europe. The Sierra's gentle slopes and wide runs make it good for beginners and intermediate skiers, not to mention noisy snowboarders in those irritating clown hats. When they are all open, the total length stretches to 62km. If the snow fails, and even if it doesn't, Granada is only half an hour away. In winter, there are few lovelier sights than the Alhambra's delicate red brown walls, etched against a towering backdrop of hard white. Then there is the sea and the prospect of swimming in the morning and skiing in the afternoon. The coastal towns of Motril and Almu\u00f1eca are just over an hour away, while after 1pm you can ride to the top of the mountain for \u00a312. How to get there Packages are not cheap compared with Andorra. Try JMC (0870 6075085, from \u00a3389pp per week half board). Exodus (020-8675 5550, sales@exodustravels.co.uk) is running a brand-new four-day multi-activity holiday for confident skiers, involving ski mountaineering, skiing, mountain biking and canyoning for \u00a3650 plus Pta30,000 for food and lift pass. easyJet (www.easyjet.com) flies London Luton to Malaga from \u00a365 return Equipment A six-day pass costs around \u00a375, and hire of skis, boots and poles from around \u00a335 per week. For the cheapest rentals, head for the outlets situated away from the telecabin. There is a choice of more than 20 ski schools, One of the biggest, the International School (+34 958 48 01 42, www.eie.es - daily classes, \u00a39; individual classes \u00a318), is the oldest in Spain with helpful instructors of several nationalities.

On the other hand, a villa shared with family or friends, tucked away in an olive grove on the shores of the Med, sounds like heaven. For the first eight or so years of our parenthood, Majorca was that heaven. </p> <p>The Val d'en Marche, in the north of the island, is a dead-end of total countryside, dotted with farmhouses and scented by orange trees. We began our Majorcan summers in Camp d'Avall, a fabulous stone-baked farmhouse near the top of the valley, which sleeps eight and is available for hire through CV Travel. Like its not-too-close neighbours, it is old, cool and flagstoned inside with simple whitewashed bedrooms, a kitchen which, while not perhaps up to Nigella Lawson's standards, will certainly do for a week or two, and a large pool with loungers and August-baked countryside brushing the back terrace. The sound of silence is broken only by the hum of bees in the bougainvillea and the thwacking of harvesters' sticks on the almond trees. </p> <p>A few years later, we defected a couple of hundred feet down the road to El Rafalet, even prettier and greener with its bamboo- and fig-shaded pool where a hammock strung between two palms made for balmy nights al fresco. Sadly, CV lost the villa to the German market, but that was not enough to deter us from spying the following year, through the crack in the garden door, on the lucky Continentals now living it up in \"our\" house. </p> <p>Wherever you end up staying, Majorca is easy. Too easy, you may think as, two hours from Gatwick, you squeeze into your Fiat Punto at Palma airport and set off along the autopista, across the island's broad farming plain. </p> <p>Some 50 minutes later, you'll be nursing a cup of coffee on a sunbaked terrace, stretching your creased legs, and debating the contents of the evening's feast. </p> <p>Fortunately, the rural isolation of the Val d'en Marche is only a 10-minute drive from a huge supermarket, which leaves no excuse for not cooking at least once. Its shelves are heaving with fresh fish, juicy meats, locally-grown fruits and vegetables, and enough breadsticks, milk, Marmite and infant jars to satisfy the most faddy of young appetites. No wonder, as the week progresses, evening conversations, loosened by Cava wine, begin veering towards the benefits of second home ownership in the Balearics. </p> <p>If it's Sunday it must be Pollen\u00e7a, hardly a metropolis but the closest north Majorca gets to a full-blown town. The lucky member of the party sent off for a hot loaf every morning will already have followed their nose to the bakery. But on Sunday morning, a great sight awaits them as they turn a corner and hit the Plaza Mayor, the main square, under full sail of the coloured parasoled market stalls. If you all go, make a morning of it - after replenishing stocks of fruit, bread, cheeses and olives, you can join the ex-pat community loafing in the caf\u00e9 around the square, many with their heads buried in the Sunday papers hot off the morning planes from Britain. </p> <p>How green was our valley? At its \"dead\" end stood the wall of the Sierra de Tramuntana, crying out to be explored. These mountains fiercely divide the eastern, resort-free shores from the rest of the island. At their heart stands the monastery of Lluc, long a centre of Catholic pilgrimage: you can still follow the original trail down to S\u00f3ller (the pilgrims take it uphill from S\u00f3ller, a far more stoic prospect). You can also stay overnight in the monastery. </p> <p>Other must-see villages include Fornalutx, which spills out of the rocks on the edge of a citrus-loaded valley; Orient, in Apple Valley, where the Hostal de Montanya has wild rabbit and suckling pig on the menu; Valldemossa, where Chopin hung out; and Deya, Robert Graves's retreat which is still heavy populated by writers and artists. </p> <p>Beauty, yes. Beaches, no. Apart from the long but narrow sands of Puerto de S\u00f3ller, the rest in the west are pebble or rock, tough on feet, and mostly hard to reach. From the Val d'en Marche there's a choice of two sandy beaches at Cala de San Vicente or, 20 minutes' drive away, at Puerta Pollen\u00e7a. Busy, but never overly so, Puerta is one of the most attractive resorts in the north, with lots of old-world charm and a traffic-free, pine-lined promenade. </p> <p>There are boats for hire, plenty of restaurants, and two or three old favourite hotels, such as the Illa d'Or, the Sis Pins and the Miramar. </p> <p>If you find yourself lulled, as we often did, into a daily routine of Puerta-lunch-house-siesta-pool-supper, at least save a day for Palma. The capital bears the cross of the high-rise dross on its doorstep which has deterred many a visitor. Yet it is as authentic a Spanish city as any on the mainland, with broad, shady boulevards, real tapas bars, Arab baths, designer shops and a cathedral that is perhaps the most satisfying in the world thanks to its richly decorated Baroque chapels and a priceless collection of treasures.

You should also travel down to the sea at Puerto de S\u00f3ller by rattling open tram through lemon and orange groves. </p> <p>There are lots of walks on Majorca, too, from gentle lanes to demanding gradients in the Tramontana range.

      "body": "<p>Measured against the hopes engendered by his 1992 election, the Clinton presidency has been a missed opportunity. Measured against present-day political realities, his immediate legacy is the triumphal return of a Republican president, a Republican-controlled Congress and a deeply divided nation.</p> <p>Bill Clinton has many achievements to his name after eight years in the White House; but as George W Bush takes the oath of office today, he has good cause to reflect on what might and should have been. Mr Clinton's presidency lacked an over-arching theme or a guiding principle. Its advances were incremental, outnumbered by its compromises and defeats. In the end the boy from Hope failed to realise his vision of a united, unifying America as a force for good in the world. In this he was fatally handicapped by his own inconsistencies, paradoxes and deep personal flaws. He urged Americans to have the \"courage to change\" but could not change himself. When Mr Clinton tried, he could be very, very good. But when he was bad, like the girl with the curl, he was very bad indeed.</p> <p>Politically speaking, Mr Clinton will be remembered more than anything else for an unprecedented economic expansion that enriched most Americans and sent the federal budget into surplus. Whether this was really his achievement or that of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is another matter. His poverty reduction, welfare and education programmes had significant impact. He was untiring in his efforts to overcome racial divisions and gender inequalities, promoting women's rights and the interests of minorities at every opportunity. He reduced crime, enhanced environmental protection (at least at home), demolished barriers to trade and championed the internet information revolution. Perhaps his biggest single challenge abroad was the promotion of democracy and reform in post-Soviet Russia. Through his cultivation of Boris Yeltsin and US economic aid, he kept relations positive, though that may be changing now. From a purely British perspective, his personal involvement in Northern Ireland brought undeniable benefits.</p> <p>On the debit side, Mr Clinton's hapless start to his first term contributed greatly to the Gingrich revolution of 1994 when the Republicans swept Congress. His centrist, compromising instincts, embodied in the New Democrat covenant (subsequently aped endlessly by third way politicians), alienated core constituencies while failing to impress opponents. The biggest casualty was his ambitious plan to provide universal healthcare. In foreign policy, too, Mr Clinton's reluctance to act boldly, to break with the past and his obsession with consensus, led to the unthinking continuance of Iraqi sanctions and the disabling perception in the Arab world that he was hopelessly biased towards Israel. Burned in Somalia in 1993, he became increasingly reluctant to support UN peacekeeping, averse to humanitarian military intervention and ever more unable to check a growing unilateralist mood. Never was the lack of a guiding philosophy more in evidence as the US failed to act to halt the Rwanda genocide, failed to halt ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and failed to halt the Chechnya atrocities while appearing more and more anxious to appease China's arrogant leadership. When he did act decisively - in Kosovo - it was, for many, already too late; and the consequences, not least for Nato, remain problematic. Mr Clinton never promised to be the world's policeman. But while exercising the prerogatives of superpower, he never quite seemed to recognise the true extent of its responsibilities. In pursuing America's interests, he ignored principled objections to projects like the World Trade Organisation. In defending America's profligacy, he did far too little to assist international efforts to address critical issues such as climate change.</p> <p>Mr Clinton was quintessentially a child of his times, the prodigal son of a fast-changing, postwar America in which traditional mores, old conventions and standards, prejudices and taboos were exploded or cast aside one by one. He brought to his job all the strengths and weaknesses of a man raised in relative poverty who survived a broken home and an abusive, alcoholic stepfather. He achieved a college education where previous generations had none, counted blacks among his friends in still-segregated deep south Arkansas, dodged Vietnam and experimented with drugs. But he was ready and eager to answer John F Kennedy's clarion call to create a better, fairer society.</p> <p>His rise to power, in retrospect as irresistible as iced tea on a hot Memphis afternoon, came with a rock'n'roll accompaniment. In overthrowing George Bush Sr, the epitome of the privileged, born-to-rule east coast establishment, he vanquished a man from a different era who was the very antithesis of Bubba, the boy from the boondocks. At that moment in November, 1992, he changed America's perception of itself. The country seemed to leap a generation or two. By way of celebration, he played sax at his inauguration party as black doormen tapped their feet to a whole new rhythm.</p> <p>Mr Clinton's most powerful quality, and the one that made him such a potent politician, was his ability to involve, stimulate and engage. This very personal charisma was the hallmark of his presidency. But it was this same hands-on style, when applied to Monica Lewinsky, that almost proved his downfall. His presidency was dogged by scandal from its very beginning; but his impeachment was its undoubted low point. Yet even in disgrace, most Americans refused ultimately to condemn him. They knew his weaknesses were theirs, too; he was, warts and all, one of them in an imperfect, changed and changing country. He leaves office with record approval ratings and would certainly have won a third term had the constitution allowed.</p> <p>Perhaps in the end Mr Clinton's most telling influence was his humanising of the presidency, his conduct of government in America's own complex, contradictory self-image. Some say he cheapened his office; others that he abused it. In truth, he brought it back to the people, brought politics down-home after the haughty imperialism of his older predecessors. For the children of the rock generation, he was Dr Feelgood with a dash of Queen. He touched Americans and moved them even if, ultimately, he failed to lead them anywhere in particular.</p>",

Mr Clinton was quintessentially a child of his times, the prodigal son of a fast-changing, postwar America in which traditional mores, old conventions and standards, prejudices and taboos were exploded or cast aside one by one. He brought to his job all the strengths and weaknesses of a man raised in relative poverty who survived a broken home and an abusive, alcoholic stepfather. He achieved a college education where previous generations had none, counted blacks among his friends in still-segregated deep south Arkansas, dodged Vietnam and experimented with drugs. But he was ready and eager to answer John F Kennedy's clarion call to create a better, fairer society. His rise to power, in retrospect as irresistible as iced tea on a hot Memphis afternoon, came with a rock'n'roll accompaniment. In overthrowing George Bush Sr, the epitome of the privileged, born-to-rule east coast establishment, he vanquished a man from a different era who was the very antithesis of Bubba, the boy from the boondocks. At that moment in November, 1992, he changed America's perception of itself. The country seemed to leap a generation or two. By way of celebration, he played sax at his inauguration party as black doormen tapped their feet to a whole new rhythm. Mr Clinton's most powerful quality, and the one that made him such a potent politician, was his ability to involve, stimulate and engage. This very personal charisma was the hallmark of his presidency. But it was this same hands-on style, when applied to Monica Lewinsky, that almost proved his downfall. His presidency was dogged by scandal from its very beginning; but his impeachment was its undoubted low point. Yet even in disgrace, most Americans refused ultimately to condemn him. They knew his weaknesses were theirs, too; he was, warts and all, one of them in an imperfect, changed and changing country. He leaves office with record approval ratings and would certainly have won a third term had the constitution allowed. Perhaps in the end Mr Clinton's most telling influence was his humanising of the presidency, his conduct of government in America's own complex, contradictory self-image. Some say he cheapened his office; others that he abused it. In truth, he brought it back to the people, brought politics down-home after the haughty imperialism of his older predecessors. For the children of the rock generation, he was Dr Feelgood with a dash of Queen. He touched Americans and moved them even if, ultimately, he failed to lead them anywhere in particular.",

However, I would recommend that TP Cooper visits the website set up by physicists at York university who are studying the phenomenon. Not only is there a lot of information and some great photographs on <a href=\"http://www.aurorawatch.york.ac.uk\">www.aurorawatch.york.ac.uk</a> but if you register with the site, they will e-mail you or send text messages to your mobile phone to alert you that the aurora are likely to occur and when and where will be the best time and place to see them. <br><strong>Dave Taylor </strong></p> <p>I have seen spectacular aurora while staying on two campsites some 170 miles apart in Scotland. Both were on the edge of the clifftops, one at Applecross overlooking Skye and the Western Isles - the other at Thurso near John O'Groats. There are some good photographs at <a href=\"http://www.netreal.co.uk/aurora/index3 htm\">www.netreal.co.uk/aurora/index3 htm</a>, taken from Fortrose near Inverness. <br><strong>Norman Meyer </strong></p> <p>The best place to see the aurora borealis in Britain is in the Shetland Islands.

However, I would recommend that TP Cooper visits the website set up by physicists at York university who are studying the phenomenon. Not only is there a lot of information and some great photographs on www.aurorawatch.york.ac.uk but if you register with the site, they will e-mail you or send text messages to your mobile phone to alert you that the aurora are likely to occur and when and where will be the best time and place to see them. Dave Taylor I have seen spectacular aurora while staying on two campsites some 170 miles apart in Scotland. Both were on the edge of the clifftops, one at Applecross overlooking Skye and the Western Isles - the other at Thurso near John O'Groats. There are some good photographs at www.netreal.co.uk/aurora/index3 htm, taken from Fortrose near Inverness. Norman Meyer The best place to see the aurora borealis in Britain is in the Shetland Islands. Clear, frosty nights are the best time, so you need to look at the weather forecast beforehand, and even then you may not be guaranteed a sighting.

      "body": "<p><strong>Friday 11pm</strong> Thirty minutes after the plane touches down, we find ourselves in Benidorm. Not Benidorm on the Costa del Sol, but a retro bar of the same name on Barcelona's Carrera de Joaquin Costa. Spookily decorated in the style of a 50s sitting room - with hostess trolleys, Bakelite fittings and weird family portraits hanging on drab flock wallpapered walls - this drinking den is stuffed with young Spaniards, for some reason passing wigs around without laughter or comment, as if it's the most normal thing to do in Barcelona on a Friday night. Maybe it is. Curly wigs, silver wigs - there's even a kinky bloke in a silk balaclava, dancing to Fame under a tiny glitterball. Barcelona is famous for its top-class museums and great restaurants, but we've come to the capital of Catalonia to sample its legendary nightlife, an idea that only starts to make sense after we sink a few beers and a few glasses of red wine with Coca-Cola (all the rage in Spain right now, according to, well, an Australian at the bar). </p> <p><strong>1am</strong> Next is Bar Iposa, a cool, orange and white-tiled split-level bar on a tree-lined square. Then it's on to La Rambla, a kaleidoscopic mile-long boulevard where you'll find caf\u00e9s, restaurants, kiosks, shopfronts with splendid art nouveau lettering, plus, of course, hordes of revellers, diners, buskers, prostitutes and transvestites. There's a faint scent of the sea as we turn a corner and enter Bar Marsella, where they sell absinthe for Pta500 (\u00a31.90) a glass. This is a fine atmospheric establishment, with peeling paint, faded wood trim, a long marble-top bar, mirrored glass cabinets holding dusty old bottles . . . and a barman from Motherwell.

      "bodyText": "Friday 11pm Thirty minutes after the plane touches down, we find ourselves in Benidorm. Not Benidorm on the Costa del Sol, but a retro bar of the same name on Barcelona's Carrera de Joaquin Costa. Spookily decorated in the style of a 50s sitting room - with hostess trolleys, Bakelite fittings and weird family portraits hanging on drab flock wallpapered walls - this drinking den is stuffed with young Spaniards, for some reason passing wigs around without laughter or comment, as if it's the most normal thing to do in Barcelona on a Friday night. Maybe it is. Curly wigs, silver wigs - there's even a kinky bloke in a silk balaclava, dancing to Fame under a tiny glitterball. Barcelona is famous for its top-class museums and great restaurants, but we've come to the capital of Catalonia to sample its legendary nightlife, an idea that only starts to make sense after we sink a few beers and a few glasses of red wine with Coca-Cola (all the rage in Spain right now, according to, well, an Australian at the bar). 1am Next is Bar Iposa, a cool, orange and white-tiled split-level bar on a tree-lined square. Then it's on to La Rambla, a kaleidoscopic mile-long boulevard where you'll find caf\u00e9s, restaurants, kiosks, shopfronts with splendid art nouveau lettering, plus, of course, hordes of revellers, diners, buskers, prostitutes and transvestites. There's a faint scent of the sea as we turn a corner and enter Bar Marsella, where they sell absinthe for Pta500 (\u00a31.90) a glass. This is a fine atmospheric establishment, with peeling paint, faded wood trim, a long marble-top bar, mirrored glass cabinets holding dusty old bottles . . . and a barman from Motherwell. It's a young crowd, well-dressed, lots of black round necks and chunky leather jackets. Already they've had two hours more drinking time than English pubs get on a Friday but all around is friendly clatter and chat, not fists and broken glass. 2.30am More red wine and Cokes, this time in the London Bar, which is as long and narrow as three train carriages end to end but with much less atmosphere.

Not so luxurious but very comfortable are the 60 Las Lomas self-catering apartments in a neat terraced village. </p> <p>The rest of the resort is made up of some 1,600 privately-owned villas and apartments; some are time-shares, some are bolt-holes for owners, and some are semi-permanent residences.

This might disappoint parents with small children looking for a relaxed, car-free and safe environment, though the parents we spoke to seemed perfectly happy. </p> <p>The facilities, particularly golf and tennis, are hard to equal anywhere in Europe, and are designed not just for the holiday family but for the professionals. Some weeks, the club hosts major sporting events - five Spanish golf Opens, Federation Cup tennis, the Nordic Soccer Cup (national teams playing a winter tournament); and club and national squads use the eight-pitch football centre for training weeks. </p> <p>During our stay we ran into the footballers of Derby County (not quite as glam as those from Real Madrid who followed a fortnight later), and we spent a couple of enjoyable evenings in the company of Gavin Hastings, Rory Underwood, Jonathan Davies, Willie John McBride and Ian Robertson who were competing in a charity pro-am golf week. </p> <p>Our first stop was the three championship golf courses. The proper golfers we spoke to were delighted with them, but as non-handicap hackers we felt a little intimidated.

Then we huffed and puffed our way back, via a very cold beer in Los Belones, where at 4.30pm only the barman seemed to have gone back to work after siesta. </p> <p>We hired a car for a day to explore, taking the coastal road to Cartagena, a huge natural harbour where Phoenician, Carthaginian and Roman ships all moored before the Arab conquest of southern Spain. Cartagena is not yet ready for the non-Spanish-speaking tourist, though: you can't get a map anywhere, and don't expect the locals to speak English in shops and restaurants - though it's only an hour from Alicante this is Spain at its most rural.

      "bodyText": "That rings a bell. No, you're thinking of Thomas Cook, which recently relaunched its site - I'll review that one next week. But it's not surprising that you're confused. Thomson may claim to be number one in the travel business (\"Let No 1 look after you\"), but it also owns Lunn Poly, Crystal, Budget Travel, Britannia Airways, the Holiday Cottages Group and Fritidsresor, a Stockholm-based operation. But even the Thomson site has around a dozen sections. Indeed. Thomson Weddings, Thomson Sports Resorts, Thomson Ski and Snowboarding, Thomson Young at Heart - the list goes on and on. The trouble is that these are all show sites - you can look, but you can't buy. To book, you'll have to go to a travel agent or ring the hotline. I just want a very cheap holiday at the last minute. The cheapest option listed was a self-catering week in \"TLS\" for \u00a3129 with accommodation allocated on arrival. I called the Thomson Direct line. \"I'd really like to book this holiday,\" I lied. \"But I wondered where TLS was?\" And the result? \"TLS? I'm afraid I don't know,\" came the reply. \"It's maybe just an airfare to Tenerife. I've got one here for \u00a399. But there's nothing coming up on the system for that date from Stansted at that price. Maybe it's already been sold.\" Maybe it was Torremolinos? Who knows? To be fair, I could have chosen the equally mysterious TRN for \u00a3139. Perhaps Thomson should start a Mystery Holidays site with the stag weekend market in mind.",

The magnet of the Canaries, so near and yet so sunny, was too much to resist in a cold, wet English December. </p> <p>This is the European Union's southernmost tip. It has Spanish language and cuisine but a winter temperature that averages 21C, around four degrees warmer than southern Spain, and those few degrees make a big difference. </p> <p>We chose Lanzarote, the most easterly island of the chain and according to the experts the most exotic. While all the Canary Islands have their extinct volcanoes, Lanzarote is dominated by them. Every hill is conical, and many have that sinister broken crater's edge where streams of lava once spilled over and poured across the landscape. The last eruption occurred in 1824. </p> <p>The ground is mostly infertile, and with its minimal rainfall the island has the misfortune of not having a single river or stream. Fresh water has to be pumped from wells or wrung out of the sea via desalinisation plants. </p> <p>In this wild environment (\"moonscape\", as no tourist brochure can avoid putting it) the few palm trees or flowering cacti that manage to take root have a special charm. But the attraction is the coast, and as it only takes an hour to drive from one end of the island to the other, and half that time to cross, you are never far from the sea. In most places, the sand is a respectable yellow, and only a few beaches have the tell-tale black sand of lava deposits. </p> <p>The oldest resort, Puerto del Carmen, has several miles of yellow sand as well as a pleasant small cove, Playa Chica, near the yachting harbour. Most of the package tours concentrate here or at Playa Blanca on the south coast. But with a rented car you can get to the quieter beaches of El Papagayo along a dirt track to the east of Playa Blanca. This area was turned into a national park a few years ago to stop any risk of coastal ribbon development. Yet even before then, Lanzarote had managed to avoid the damage done by uncontrolled building. </p> <p>The hero was a draconian figure called Cesar Manrique, who has left his stamp all over his native island. An internationally-acclaimed architect and artist, he was friendly with the island's political leadership and used his influence to ensure that development was strictly regulated and the island's character preserved. </p> <p>High-rise building and advertising hoardings were banned. Every house, even in the remotest hamlet, had to be white-washed, its doors and window-frames painted green or blue. </p> <p> We had intended to have a lazy week reading by the pool but found ourselves spending more time exploring the island. The volcano of Timanfaya is Lanzarote's main curiosity, and well worth a half-day excursion. At the El Diablo restaurant, those in quest for the ultimate culinary sensation can enjoy (besides the stunning view) chicken or beef grilled over the heat of the volcano. </p> <p>Another fascinating volcanic excursion is to the Cueva de los Verdes, a tunnel-like cave formed by a prehistoric eruption. As it poured towards the sea, the river of lava cooled at the top and hardened, leaving a long tunnel underneath. But unlike caves in most other parts of the world, Lanzarote's minimal rainfall has left this one dry and a pleasant 18 degrees, and you can wander through in light clothes admiring the colours of the rocks. </p> <p>One day, we drove to Lanzarote's most stunning beach, at Famara in the north-west. At the foot of beetling cliffs, this is a mile-long stretch of breakers on a wide curved bay, and a surfer's delight on days when the currents are not too strong. </p> <p>Lanzarote is not \"organised\" for rambling and there are no officially marked trails, but by walking beyond the last house, we found a contour path about a third of the way up the cliffs. The breakers looked wonderful from above and in three hours we met only one other hiker. </p> <p>Surrounded by the sea and with minimal opportunities for agriculture, Lanzarote's people mainly used to live off fish. Seafood is still the mainstay of the cuisine, although most of the shellfish that appears on every menu is flown in deep-frozen from elsewhere. The best local fish is cherne , which is unique to this part of the Atlantic and has a fine fleshy texture. Mero (grouper) and vieja are also local. To sample them at their best, head for one of the fishing villages rather than the larger tourist resorts. </p> <p>At Orzola, at the northern tip of the island, we had an excellent meal at Os Gallegos. The fish is all freshly caught and came, as is common in most Lanzarote restaurants, accompanied by tiny potatoes which are cooked in their skins ( papas arrugadas ) and sprinkled with a red chilli sauce ( mojo rojo ). The three-course meal cost about \u00a311 a head including wine. </p> <p>In Puerto Calero, the quiet settlement of villas where we stayed, there is a choice of a dozen restaurants alongside the yachting marina. Most offer comfortable wicker-work armchairs at their alfresco tables. Our favourite was Don Quixote, which has a superb gazpacho starter and plenty of fish dishes. Here, too, a three-course meal cost little more than \u00a311. </p> <p>Tapas bars are everywhere. We liked La Lonja in the old port area of Puerto del Carmen, where locals also drop in and seem not to mind rubbing shoulders with tourists. </p> <p>For a splurge, you cannot do better than the four-star Gran Melia Salinas in the resort of Costa Teguise. The building was conceived by the unavoidable Signor Manrique, and is centred on three courtyards filled with jungle trees, palms, lianas, and rustling streams. The style has since become a clich\u00e9 elsewhere, but this early example is outstanding. The restaurant on the edge of Courtyard Three is first-class, and even here the price per person plus wine does not top \u00a330. </p> <p>Surprisingly, in view of its volcanic character, Lanzarote has its own wine. Nowhere in the world can vines be more lovingly tended. If you drive out to La Geria, you can marvel at the way the farmers dig a series of small round depressions in the volcanic black soil, and surround each one with a stone wall. The occasional rain is collected in the hole, the wind is kept at bay by the wall, and the year-round warmth and almost constant sunshine do the rest. </p> <p>The resulting wine is more than passable, and had it not been for the insistent temptation to see as much of this unusual island as possible in the space of only seven days, we would have drunk a whole lot more of it. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> Meon Villas (01730-230370) has a range of four and five-star villas, starting from \u00a3344pp per week. Jonathan Steele stayed one week at the Villa Ramos, above Puerto Calero, which costs from \u00a3499pp, based on six sharing, including return flights, airport taxes, villa accommodation with private pool, welcome pack, weekly cleaning service, and car hire with unlimited mileage. For departures February 22 to April 4 the price is \u00a3585pp. In January and February, Meon Villas has special offers on selected four- and five-star villas in Lanzarote with savings of up to \u00a3247pp on one week bookings.

The resulting wine is more than passable, and had it not been for the insistent temptation to see as much of this unusual island as possible in the space of only seven days, we would have drunk a whole lot more of it. The practicals Meon Villas (01730-230370) has a range of four and five-star villas, starting from \u00a3344pp per week. Jonathan Steele stayed one week at the Villa Ramos, above Puerto Calero, which costs from \u00a3499pp, based on six sharing, including return flights, airport taxes, villa accommodation with private pool, welcome pack, weekly cleaning service, and car hire with unlimited mileage. For departures February 22 to April 4 the price is \u00a3585pp. In January and February, Meon Villas has special offers on selected four- and five-star villas in Lanzarote with savings of up to \u00a3247pp on one week bookings.

When I say meatballs, I mean it in the most literal way, for criadillas are bull's testicles. Still, if that's not to your taste, there's always the Bar Soriano next door. It serves nothing but mushrooms; grilled, dripping with garlic and delicious. </p> <p>That's the great thing about the tapas bars in Logro\u00f1o. If you don't like what's served in one, you can always try the one next door. Or the one next to that. In fact, along the narrow, pedes trianised Calle Laurel in the town's old quarter, it's literally wall-to-wall tapas bars. Most specialise in one particular dish, such as the Soriano. </p> <p>Along the main street there's everything on offer, from cured ham and pork chops to stuffed peppers and grilled aubergines, from Spanish omelettes to spicy mussels, and a local night out is something my Spanish friend Patricia calls chiquiteo , or \"tapas-hopping\" - a bar-crawl with food thrown in. </p> <p>The tapas bars in Calle Laurel don't necessarily serve the best dishes in Logro\u00f1o. For that, you need to look further afield, such as the Bar Tahiti in Avenida Republica Argentina, whose Spanish omelette was recently judged fourth best in Spain. What they have in spades is atmosphere - at 10pm on a Friday or Saturday night, the whole street is bursting with people, noise and garlicky aromas. The crowd is made up of revellers of all ages. There are constant shrieks and laughter as people bump into their friends. We begin as a threesome and end up with about a dozen of Patricia's friends - although after my 10th glass of wine it became increasingly difficult to work out exactly who was in our group. </p> <p>Logro\u00f1o is the capital of La Rioja, situated in northern Spain where the Castilian centre meets the Basque country. An hour and a half's drive south of Bilbao, the region is virtually unknown to British tourists. Guidebooks give it the most cursory of mentions, or often none at all. Admittedly, it lacks the celebrated history of, say, Toledo or Seville, or the buzz of Barcelona, but, if you want to explore an authentic slice of rural Spain, this is the place for you. </p> <p>Not that the region is short of history. Logro\u00f1o itself was devastated by El Cid in 1092, and the province is rich in monasteries, churches, castles and medieval walled towns. </p> <p>However for me, the real treasures of La Rioja are the sierras. True, this isn't the Pyrenees, and the hills are more rolling than alpine, but it is high enough - over 2,000m in places - to have its own ski resort, at Valdezcaray near Ezcaray. There are lovely walks through mountain woodland, cycle rides along forest tracks and days to be spent exploring remote mountain villages. The day after our tapas hopping, we headed to one such village, Villoslada de Cameros, where Patricia's family owns a house. </p> <p>Wool made Villoslada one of the richest villages in Europe before Australian imports flooded the market in the 1800s. In the 20th century, the inhabitants of Villoslada and other nearby villages abandoned the countryside for the cities. The rural exodus reached such a level that one village was left with only two inhabitants - a brother and sister who apparently didn't talk to each other. </p> <p>Recently, though, the children of those who moved away started renovating the crumbling stone houses for use as summer homes. A fledgling tourist industry has developed, catering mainly to Spanish city-dwellers in search of fresh air and rural ambience. </p> <p>La Rioja has much the same appeal as, say, Tuscany or inland Provence: sun, rolling hills, great food and wine, but it is not overrun with middle-class Brits. So at the moment you can have La Rioja's vineyards, forests and villages virtually to yourself. And as many bull's testicles as you can eat. </p> <p><strong> What to eat and where to find it </strong><br></p> <p>The word tapas literally means lid and derives from an old custom of serving wine in jugs topped with a piece of food that formed an edible lid. Tapas comes in four basic forms. The smallest and cheapest are nibbles such as stuffed olives or shrimps, eaten with your fingers. Pinchos are a little more substantial such as garlic mushrooms or grilled meat kebabs, served on skewers. Cazuelas are mini-stews such as patatas bravas (spicy potatoes) served in small clay dishes. Finally there are bocadillos - sandwiches - although most tapas come with a chunk of bread to soak up the oil and garlic. </p> <p>House specialities are advertised on boards or incorporated in the name of the bar (El Jamonero, for instance). Alternatively, watch what the other customers order. </p> <p>Rioja's cuisine is characterised by abundant fruit and vegetables (asparagus, artichokes, red peppers, peaches, pears) and meat - particularly pork in various forms, from chorizo and jamon de serrano (like Parma ham) to grilled chops and stews. </p> <p>Regional specialities include cabrito (grilled baby goat), pimientos rellenos (grilled stuffed peppers), pochas (white bean stew), caparrones (another bean stew with chorizo) and fardelejos (pastry parcels with an almond-paste filling). As you might expect, olive oil, garlic and tomatoes feature prominently. </p> <p>Wines are mainly red and range from the standard origen calificada to the superior crianza, reserva and gran reserva levels. Gran reserva (aged for two years in oak casks and three years in the bottle for reds, four in total for whites) is tops, although we're talking up to \u00a330 or \u00a340 a bottle.

      "byline": "Dave Eggers",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>The Memoir as Self-Destruction Aspect</strong><br></p> <p> This Aspect turned out to be much too prescient. I truly felt while writing the book that actually publishing it would be the end of me. I thought that a) the book would alienate me from my friends and relatives, even those who had read it well before publication and provided approval; and b) the book would enrage many readers for one reason or another, and would compel them to come and kill me. In October of 1998, when I started working in earnest on finishing the book's original text, and was poring through hundreds of journal entries, I called my brother Bill at about 4am one night and talked into his machine for a while about what should happen to these entries should I get hit by a train or blown up in an airplane or, most likely, killed by a man in an elevator, wearing a trenchcoat. (For years I feared the opening of every elevator, half-convinced that from the opened doors would come a bullet, for me, shot by a man in a tan trenchcoat. I have no idea why I feared this, expected it to happen. I even knew how I would react to this bullet coming from the elevator door, what word I would say. That word was: Finally.) </p> <p>So I told Bill not to worry, that I was not suicidal, never that - when we leave such messages, we always have to render the boundaries immediately, so as not to provoke worry - but that, should anything happen, that under no circumstances was anyone to be allowed to see any of my journal entries, that even if behavioural scientists begged for them, that he was not to release them, and under no circumstances was he to compile any unfinished stuff, edit it without mercy and make it into a book about a safari-oriented m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois. </p> <p>The call to Bill reflected both my usual death-paranoia and also the fact that around that time the creation of the book began to seem eerily like a coming, self-induced death, probably a violent one. As if I'd been diagnosed with something horrible, something quick and unmerciful, ebola maybe, and that I was heading toward its inevitable result with no options other than to allow it to eat me from the inside out, liquefy my innards - or else take matters into my own hands and beat the ebola to the punch. I began to wonder why there are so many symptomatic similarities between the way I was thinking, and the way I'd read that suicidal people feel. I woke up late each day, I showered occasionally, I did not clean my house... </p> <p> Yes, none of these things was new, but other things were. Chiefly, when I thought about suicide, it no longer seemed like such a foreign concept, such a remote possibility. The impulse toward suicide began to seem like something that could creep up on me, something that was more plausible than before, and something that might seem increasingly plausible in the future. I was tired, and my water-treading abilities seemed to be weakening. Then of course there was the likelihood, more glamorous and self-serving for someone begotten by a Catholic martyr, that someone would kill me, as I kept picturing. And oddly enough, when not picturing it happening from the cavity of a closing elevator, I envisioned it occurring, fittingly enough, at a reading.</p> <p> In one of my many such daydreams, there was a recurring image of a man in a raincoat pushing through the assembled with a snub-nosed pistol and, once close enough, shooting me square in the chest. In the scenario, which was for some reason always set in the back portion of Rose Records, a music-purveying shop on Green Street in Champaign, Illinois, I always vacillate between a) jumping under the desk and avoiding the shots long enough for him to be wrestled to the ground by... by bookstore security, I guess; and b) the reaction that seems to make more sense: I sit up straight and offer my chest to him, take the bullet, and am killed. </p> <p>So because I knew that many people would be saddened by the appearance of this book - those who cared about my father, for instance, and feel I was unfair - I figured that, after its publication, I'd be in hiding somewhere, that I would disappear - to safety! Right. So, the visions and their increased dream-to-life probability brought to mind what I used to tell Toph, when he would come to me when he couldn't sleep, when he was terrified, as I was, at age nine, of death, not of imminent death but any death at all, eventual death, the fact of death somehow more tangible at nine than at 30 or 50 - he, like I did at his age, saw the door of life closing already, however distantly and slowly, and couldn't bring himself to sleep, and so, sitting on the couch in our place in Berkeley, we had to talk about the afterlife, and my explanation to him at that point was this: \"Well, Toph, I do believe in some sort of afterlife, I suppose because it just seems more logical that there is one than there is not. I mean, if we can so clearly conceive of it, if so many disparate (no I didn't use that word at the time) peoples can conceive of it, then it almost means that there must be...\" Etc.</p> <p> And that's how I had come to think about imminent and violent death, the shot from the man in the elevator or at the reading: because I saw it so often, and it was beginning to make more and more sense, to seem less and less fantastical, then it almost followed that it was more likely than before, that it had been pre-ordained, mapped out more or less, given a time frame, scheduled, and I had been simply watching previews of something coming, without equivocation, soon.</p> <p>There is, intrinsic to the process of a memoir, the resulting destruction of one's former self. Writing about those years, and being as cruel to who I was as I could be, implicitly means that you are killing that person. Yes, you are sometimes celebrating that person's better moments, and relating with sympathy that person's better thoughts, but overall you are saying: This was me then, and I can look at that person, from the distance I now have, and throw water balloons on his stupid fat head. But even as good an idea as that seems to be, an idea attractive to the intellectually violent, it is also a very painful plan to carry out, and one that is rebelled against, by various self-preservative internal forces. Which is not to say anything of what happens once those thoughts are read and processed by the public at large. However much I tried to make happen the things I wanted to happen, and however much I tried to prevent things from happening that I hoped would not, they happened anyway.</p> <p> It was, for the most part, very entertaining. Were parts of the process incredibly painful? They were. I wrote a book in large part about the deaths of my parents, and living with my brother thereafter, and this, inexplicably, brought out in a very few people a kind of malice that I have rarely seen. Very strange. But it was not entirely unexpected. The weird thing is that while writing the original text, I had in my head not the usual Writer's Ideal Reader, but instead my own potential reading person, the Mean/Jaded/Skimming Reader - the person I had been for many years. Thus I expected the worst from the book's readers, I expected claws and blood and teeth. The book ends with a plea for those who would tear into me to just go ahead and do it, because I wanted it to happen, finally. </p> <p> But then a weird thing happened: People were kind. It was almost impossible to find people who were as vicious and small as I had for many years been. Not completely impossible, but still: I expected crucifixion and instead got something more like its opposite.</p> <p><strong>Where is your brother?</strong><br></p> <p> This happened: At a reading in Portland, I read the passage involving the being-annoyed-at-being-asked this question part, and, immediately afterward, a middle-aged woman in the third row raised her hand and asked, in English but with what sounded like a German accent: So where iz ya brotdha now? And she was not kidding. This sort of thing still happens. For fun, Toph and I actually did one reading together, in Austin, which turned out to be sort of a mistake, given the pleasure he takes in dismantling his brother's tendencies toward the precious. Sitting next to me, pen in hand, every page I would sign, he would turn over and, on its underside, go to work on a deconstruction or outright parody of whatever I had written in whomever's book. </p> <p><strong>Irony and its malcontents</strong><br></p> <p> This section should be skipped by most, for it is annoying and pedantic, and directed to a very few. They know who they are. Here we go: You can't know how much it pains me to even have that word, the one beginning with i and ending in y, in this book. It is not a word I like to see, anywhere, much less type on to my own pages. It is beyond a doubt the most overused and under-understood word we currently have. I have that i-word here only to make clear what was clear to, by my estimations, about 99.9% of original hardcover readers of this book: that there is almost no irony, whatsoever, within its covers. </p> <p> But to hear a few people tell it, this entire book, or most of it, was/is ironic. Well. Well. Ahem. Well. Let's define irony as the dictionary does: the use of words to express something different from and often opposite to their literal meaning. Now, where, keeping that definition in mind, do we find that herein? We do find some things that might have confused the reader prone to presuming this irony, so let's address them one at a time: </p> <p> 1. When someone kids around, it does not necessarily mean he or she is being ironic. That is, when one tells a joke, in any context, it can mean, simply, that a joke is being told. Further, satire is not inherently ironic. Nor is parody. Or any kind of comedy. Irony is a very specific and not all that interesting thing, and to use the word/concept to blanket half of all contemporary cultural production - which some aged arbiters seem to be doing (particularly with regard to work made by those under a certain age) - is akin to the too-common citing of \"the Midwest\" as the regional impediment to all national social progress (when we all know the \"Midwest\" is 10 miles outside of any city). In other words, to refer to everything odd, coincidental, eerie, absurd or strangely funny as ironic is, frankly, an abomination upon the Lord. (Re that last clause: not irony, but a simple, wholesome, American-born exaggeration.)</p> <p> To illustrate the many more things that are not ironic but are often referred to as such, let's look at some sample sentences, starring a wee wayward pup known as Benji, and see if we can illuminate some distinctions. </p> <p>Sample: Benji was run over by a bus. Isn't that ironic?</p> <p>No: That is not ironic. That is unfortunate, but it is not ironic.</p> <p>Sample: It was a bright and sunny day when Benji was run over by a bus. Ironic, no?</p> <p>Again, no: That is not irony. It is an instance of dissonance between weather and tragedy. </p> <p>Sample: It is ironic that Benji was on his way to the vet when he was run over by a bus.</p> <p>Still: That is not irony. That is a coincidence that might be called eerie.</p> <p>Sample: It is ironic that Benji was run over on the same day he misused the word ironic.</p> <p>But see: This is, again, a coincidence. It is wonderfully appropriate that he was run over on this day, deserving as he was of punishment, but it is not ironic.</p> <p> 2. Now, on a related subject: simply because humour is found in a context of pain, does not make that humour ironic. I have heard people claim that there is irony in the first chapter of this book, a chapter that is excruciatingly serious and straightforward. Are there even a few funny moments in this section? Absolutely not. But what confuses some people is the use of a device here or there, a formal trick or innovation that this sort of reader finds bothersome in the same way that a certain king of lore is said to have told a certain court composer that his music had too many notes.</p> <p> 3. If we dismiss the idea that all formal fun - and we must be allowed it - constitutes irony, then we must agree that: </p> <p> 5. Prefaces are not ironic. </p> <p>6. Notations are not ironic. </p> <p>7. Diagrams are not ironic. </p> <p> 8. Funny titles are not ironic. </p> <p> 9. Numbered points are not ironic. </p> <p>10. Footnotes are not ironic*. </p> <p>11. Small type is not ironic.</p> <p> 11a. Appendices are not ironic. </p> <p>12. Having characters break out of character is not ironic. </p> <p> Wait, back to humour for a second: Generally, if a joke is told, or a humorous anecdote relayed, and by chance you do not understand that joke or humorous anecdote, it does not mean it is ironic. Or \"neo-ironic\". It simply means that you do not understand that joke. And that is okay. There have been a few readers who have taken the long, messy run-on of the book's end, even that passage, as ironic. Which is so disturbing. A parody of Ulysses? What is wrong with you people? </p> <p> But such interpretations, in the end, aren't really my problem. When I was done, I was ashamed, because I had written what I saw as a much too revealing and maudlin thing, overflowing with blood and sentiment and a simple bare longing for people who are gone. The book was seen by its author as a stupid risk, and an ugly thing, and a betrayal, and overall, as a mistake he would regret for the rest of his life but a mistake which nevertheless he could not refrain from making and, worse, as a mistake he would encourage everyone to make, because everyone should make big, huge mistakes, because </p> <p>a) They don't want you to;</p> <p> b) Because they haven't the balls themselves and your doing it reminds them of their status as havers-of-no-balls; </p> <p>c) Because your life is worth documenting; </p> <p>d) Because if you do not believe your life is worth documenting then why are you wasting your time/our time? Our air?</p> <p> e) Because if you do it right and go straight toward them, you, like me, will write to them and will look straight into their eyes when writing, will look straight into their fucking eyes, like a person sometimes can do with another person, and tell them something, even though you might not know them well, or at all, and even if you wrote in their books or hugged them or put your hand on their arm, you still would scarcely know them, but even so wrote a book that was really a letter to them, a messy fucking letter that you could barely keep a grip on, but a letter you meant, and a letter you sometimes wish you had not mailed, but a letter you are happy that made it from you to them. </p> <p>* What the fuck is ironic about this?</p> <p>\u00a9 Dave Eggers.

Yes, you are sometimes celebrating that person's better moments, and relating with sympathy that person's better thoughts, but overall you are saying: This was me then, and I can look at that person, from the distance I now have, and throw water balloons on his stupid fat head. But even as good an idea as that seems to be, an idea attractive to the intellectually violent, it is also a very painful plan to carry out, and one that is rebelled against, by various self-preservative internal forces. Which is not to say anything of what happens once those thoughts are read and processed by the public at large. However much I tried to make happen the things I wanted to happen, and however much I tried to prevent things from happening that I hoped would not, they happened anyway. It was, for the most part, very entertaining. Were parts of the process incredibly painful? They were. I wrote a book in large part about the deaths of my parents, and living with my brother thereafter, and this, inexplicably, brought out in a very few people a kind of malice that I have rarely seen. Very strange. But it was not entirely unexpected. The weird thing is that while writing the original text, I had in my head not the usual Writer's Ideal Reader, but instead my own potential reading person, the Mean/Jaded/Skimming Reader - the person I had been for many years. Thus I expected the worst from the book's readers, I expected claws and blood and teeth. The book ends with a plea for those who would tear into me to just go ahead and do it, because I wanted it to happen, finally. But then a weird thing happened: People were kind. It was almost impossible to find people who were as vicious and small as I had for many years been. Not completely impossible, but still: I expected crucifixion and instead got something more like its opposite. Where is your brother? This happened: At a reading in Portland, I read the passage involving the being-annoyed-at-being-asked this question part, and, immediately afterward, a middle-aged woman in the third row raised her hand and asked, in English but with what sounded like a German accent: So where iz ya brotdha now? And she was not kidding. This sort of thing still happens. For fun, Toph and I actually did one reading together, in Austin, which turned out to be sort of a mistake, given the pleasure he takes in dismantling his brother's tendencies toward the precious. Sitting next to me, pen in hand, every page I would sign, he would turn over and, on its underside, go to work on a deconstruction or outright parody of whatever I had written in whomever's book. Irony and its malcontents This section should be skipped by most, for it is annoying and pedantic, and directed to a very few. They know who they are. Here we go: You can't know how much it pains me to even have that word, the one beginning with i and ending in y, in this book. It is not a word I like to see, anywhere, much less type on to my own pages. It is beyond a doubt the most overused and under-understood word we currently have. I have that i-word here only to make clear what was clear to, by my estimations, about 99.9% of original hardcover readers of this book: that there is almost no irony, whatsoever, within its covers. But to hear a few people tell it, this entire book, or most of it, was/is ironic. Well. Well. Ahem. Well. Let's define irony as the dictionary does: the use of words to express something different from and often opposite to their literal meaning. Now, where, keeping that definition in mind, do we find that herein? We do find some things that might have confused the reader prone to presuming this irony, so let's address them one at a time: 1. When someone kids around, it does not necessarily mean he or she is being ironic. That is, when one tells a joke, in any context, it can mean, simply, that a joke is being told. Further, satire is not inherently ironic. Nor is parody. Or any kind of comedy. Irony is a very specific and not all that interesting thing, and to use the word/concept to blanket half of all contemporary cultural production - which some aged arbiters seem to be doing (particularly with regard to work made by those under a certain age) - is akin to the too-common citing of \"the Midwest\" as the regional impediment to all national social progress (when we all know the \"Midwest\" is 10 miles outside of any city). In other words, to refer to everything odd, coincidental, eerie, absurd or strangely funny as ironic is, frankly, an abomination upon the Lord. (Re that last clause: not irony, but a simple, wholesome, American-born exaggeration.) To illustrate the many more things that are not ironic but are often referred to as such, let's look at some sample sentences, starring a wee wayward pup known as Benji, and see if we can illuminate some distinctions. Sample: Benji was run over by a bus. Isn't that ironic? No: That is not ironic. That is unfortunate, but it is not ironic. Sample: It was a bright and sunny day when Benji was run over by a bus. Ironic, no? Again, no: That is not irony. It is an instance of dissonance between weather and tragedy. Sample: It is ironic that Benji was on his way to the vet when he was run over by a bus. Still: That is not irony. That is a coincidence that might be called eerie. Sample: It is ironic that Benji was run over on the same day he misused the word ironic. But see: This is, again, a coincidence. It is wonderfully appropriate that he was run over on this day, deserving as he was of punishment, but it is not ironic. 2. Now, on a related subject: simply because humour is found in a context of pain, does not make that humour ironic. I have heard people claim that there is irony in the first chapter of this book, a chapter that is excruciatingly serious and straightforward. Are there even a few funny moments in this section? Absolutely not. But what confuses some people is the use of a device here or there, a formal trick or innovation that this sort of reader finds bothersome in the same way that a certain king of lore is said to have told a certain court composer that his music had too many notes. 3. If we dismiss the idea that all formal fun - and we must be allowed it - constitutes irony, then we must agree that: 5. Prefaces are not ironic. 6. Notations are not ironic. 7. Diagrams are not ironic. 8. Funny titles are not ironic. 9. Numbered points are not ironic. 10. Footnotes are not ironic*. 11. Small type is not ironic. 11a. Appendices are not ironic. 12. Having characters break out of character is not ironic. Wait, back to humour for a second: Generally, if a joke is told, or a humorous anecdote relayed, and by chance you do not understand that joke or humorous anecdote, it does not mean it is ironic. Or \"neo-ironic\". It simply means that you do not understand that joke. And that is okay. There have been a few readers who have taken the long, messy run-on of the book's end, even that passage, as ironic. Which is so disturbing. A parody of Ulysses? What is wrong with you people? But such interpretations, in the end, aren't really my problem. When I was done, I was ashamed, because I had written what I saw as a much too revealing and maudlin thing, overflowing with blood and sentiment and a simple bare longing for people who are gone. The book was seen by its author as a stupid risk, and an ugly thing, and a betrayal, and overall, as a mistake he would regret for the rest of his life but a mistake which nevertheless he could not refrain from making and, worse, as a mistake he would encourage everyone to make, because everyone should make big, huge mistakes, because a) They don't want you to; b) Because they haven't the balls themselves and your doing it reminds them of their status as havers-of-no-balls; c) Because your life is worth documenting; d) Because if you do not believe your life is worth documenting then why are you wasting your time/our time? Our air? e) Because if you do it right and go straight toward them, you, like me, will write to them and will look straight into their eyes when writing, will look straight into their fucking eyes, like a person sometimes can do with another person, and tell them something, even though you might not know them well, or at all, and even if you wrote in their books or hugged them or put your hand on their arm, you still would scarcely know them, but even so wrote a book that was really a letter to them, a messy fucking letter that you could barely keep a grip on, but a letter you meant, and a letter you sometimes wish you had not mailed, but a letter you are happy that made it from you to them. * What the fuck is ironic about this? \u00a9 Dave Eggers.

      "body": "<b>The Memoir as Self-Destruction Aspect</b> <br> <p> This Aspect turned out to be much too prescient. I truly felt while writing the book that actually publishing it would be the end of me. I thought that a) the book would alienate me from my friends and relatives, even those who had read it well before publication and provided approval; and b) the book would enrage many readers for one reason or another, and would compel them to come and kill me. In October of 1998, when I started working in earnest on finishing the book's original text, and was poring through hundreds of journal entries, I called my brother Bill at about 4am one night and talked into his machine for a while about what should happen to these entries should I get hit by a train or blown up in an airplane or, most likely, killed by a man in an elevator, wearing a trenchcoat. (For years I feared the opening of every elevator, half-convinced that from the opened doors would come a bullet, for me, shot by a man in a tan trenchcoat. I have no idea why I feared this, expected it to happen. I even knew how I would react to this bullet coming from the elevator door, what word I would say. That word was: Finally.) </p> <p>So I told Bill not to worry, that I was not suicidal, never that - when we leave such messages, we always have to render the boundaries immediately, so as not to provoke worry - but that, should anything happen, that under no circumstances was anyone to be allowed to see any of my journal entries, that even if behavioural scientists begged for them, that he was not to release them, and under no circumstances was he to compile any unfinished stuff, edit it without mercy and make it into a book about a safari-oriented m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois. </p> <p>The call to Bill reflected both my usual death-paranoia and also the fact that around that time the creation of the book began to seem eerily like a coming, self-induced death, probably a violent one. As if I'd been diagnosed with something horrible, something quick and unmerciful, ebola maybe, and that I was heading toward its inevitable result with no options other than to allow it to eat me from the inside out, liquefy my innards - or else take matters into my own hands and beat the ebola to the punch. I began to wonder why there are so many symptomatic similarities between the way I was thinking, and the way I'd read that suicidal people feel. I woke up late each day, I showered occasionally, I did not clean my house... </p> <p> Yes, none of these things was new, but other things were. Chiefly, when I thought about suicide, it no longer seemed like such a foreign concept, such a remote possibility. The impulse toward suicide began to seem like something that could creep up on me, something that was more plausible than before, and something that might seem increasingly plausible in the future. I was tired, and my water-treading abilities seemed to be weakening. Then of course there was the likelihood, more glamorous and self-serving for someone begotten by a Catholic martyr, that someone would kill me, as I kept picturing. And oddly enough, when not picturing it happening from the cavity of a closing elevator, I envisioned it occurring, fittingly enough, at a reading.</p> <p> In one of my many such daydreams, there was a recurring image of a man in a raincoat pushing through the assembled with a snub-nosed pistol and, once close enough, shooting me square in the chest. In the scenario, which was for some reason always set in the back portion of Rose Records, a music-purveying shop on Green Street in Champaign, Illinois, I always vacillate between a) jumping under the desk and avoiding the shots long enough for him to be wrestled to the ground by... by bookstore security, I guess; and b) the reaction that seems to make more sense: I sit up straight and offer my chest to him, take the bullet, and am killed. </p> <p>So because I knew that many people would be saddened by the appearance of this book - those who cared about my father, for instance, and feel I was unfair - I figured that, after its publication, I'd be in hiding somewhere, that I would disappear - to safety! Right. So, the visions and their increased dream-to-life probability brought to mind what I used to tell Toph, when he would come to me when he couldn't sleep, when he was terrified, as I was, at age nine, of death, not of imminent death but any death at all, eventual death, the fact of death somehow more tangible at nine than at 30 or 50 - he, like I did at his age, saw the door of life closing already, however distantly and slowly, and couldn't bring himself to sleep, and so, sitting on the couch in our place in Berkeley, we had to talk about the afterlife, and my explanation to him at that point was this: \"Well, Toph, I do believe in some sort of afterlife, I suppose because it just seems more logical that there is one than there is not. I mean, if we can so clearly conceive of it, if so many disparate (no I didn't use that word at the time) peoples can conceive of it, then it almost means that there must be...\" Etc.</p> <p> And that's how I had come to think about imminent and violent death, the shot from the man in the elevator or at the reading: because I saw it so often, and it was beginning to make more and more sense, to seem less and less fantastical, then it almost followed that it was more likely than before, that it had been pre-ordained, mapped out more or less, given a time frame, scheduled, and I had been simply watching previews of something coming, without equivocation, soon.</p> <p>There is, intrinsic to the process of a memoir, the resulting destruction of one's former self.

I wrote a book in large part about the deaths of my parents, and living with my brother thereafter, and this, inexplicably, brought out in a very few people a kind of malice that I have rarely seen. Very strange. But it was not entirely unexpected. The weird thing is that while writing the original text, I had in my head not the usual Writer's Ideal Reader, but instead my own potential reading person, the Mean/Jaded/Skimming Reader - the person I had been for many years. Thus I expected the worst from the book's readers, I expected claws and blood and teeth. The book ends with a plea for those who would tear into me to just go ahead and do it, because I wanted it to happen, finally. But then a weird thing happened: People were kind. It was almost impossible to find people who were as vicious and small as I had for many years been. Not completely impossible, but still: I expected crucifixion and instead got something more like its opposite. Where is your brother? This happened: At a reading in Portland, I read the passage involving the being-annoyed-at-being-asked this question part, and, immediately afterward, a middle-aged woman in the third row raised her hand and asked, in English but with what sounded like a German accent: So where iz ya brotdha now? And she was not kidding. This sort of thing still happens. For fun, Toph and I actually did one reading together, in Austin, which turned out to be sort of a mistake, given the pleasure he takes in dismantling his brother's tendencies toward the precious. Sitting next to me, pen in hand, every page I would sign, he would turn over and, on its underside, go to work on a deconstruction or outright parody of whatever I had written in whomever's book. Irony and its malcontents This section should be skipped by most, for it is annoying and pedantic, and directed to a very few. They know who they are. Here we go: You can't know how much it pains me to even have that word, the one beginning with i and ending in y, in this book. It is not a word I like to see, anywhere, much less type on to my own pages. It is beyond a doubt the most overused and under-understood word we currently have. I have that i-word here only to make clear what was clear to, by my estimations, about 99.9% of original hardcover readers of this book: that there is almost no irony, whatsoever, within its covers. But to hear a few people tell it, this entire book, or most of it, was/is ironic. Well. Well. Ahem. Well. Let's define irony as the dictionary does: the use of words to express something different from and often opposite to their literal meaning. Now, where, keeping that definition in mind, do we find that herein? We do find some things that might have confused the reader prone to presuming this irony, so let's address them one at a time: 1. When someone kids around, it does not necessarily mean he or she is being ironic. That is, when one tells a joke, in any context, it can mean, simply, that a joke is being told. Further, satire is not inherently ironic. Nor is parody. Or any kind of comedy. Irony is a very specific and not all that interesting thing, and to use the word/concept to blanket half of all contemporary cultural production - which some aged arbiters seem to be doing (particularly with regard to work made by those under a certain age) - is akin to the too-common citing of \"the Midwest\" as the regional impediment to all national social progress (when we all know the \"Midwest\" is 10 miles outside of any city). In other words, to refer to everything odd, coincidental, eerie, absurd or strangely funny as ironic is, frankly, an abomination upon the Lord. (Re that last clause: not irony, but a simple, wholesome, American-born exaggeration.) To illustrate the many more things that are not ironic but are often referred to as such, let's look at some sample sentences, starring a wee wayward pup known as Benji, and see if we can illuminate some distinctions. Sample: Benji was run over by a bus. Isn't that ironic? No: That is not ironic. That is unfortunate, but it is not ironic. Sample: It was a bright and sunny day when Benji was run over by a bus. Ironic, no? Again, no: That is not irony. It is an instance of dissonance between weather and tragedy. Sample: It is ironic that Benji was on his way to the vet when he was run over by a bus. Still: That is not irony. That is a coincidence that might be called eerie. Sample: It is ironic that Benji was run over on the same day he misused the word ironic. But see: This is, again, a coincidence. It is wonderfully appropriate that he was run over on this day, deserving as he was of punishment, but it is not ironic. 2. Now, on a related subject: simply because humour is found in a context of pain, does not make that humour ironic. I have heard people claim that there is irony in the first chapter of this book, a chapter that is excruciatingly serious and straightforward. Are there even a few funny moments in this section? Absolutely not. But what confuses some people is the use of a device here or there, a formal trick or innovation that this sort of reader finds bothersome in the same way that a certain king of lore is said to have told a certain court composer that his music had too many notes. 3. If we dismiss the idea that all formal fun - and we must be allowed it - constitutes irony, then we must agree that: 5. Prefaces are not ironic. 6. Notations are not ironic. 7. Diagrams are not ironic. 8. Funny titles are not ironic. 9. Numbered points are not ironic. 10. Footnotes are not ironic*. 11. Small type is not ironic. 11a. Appendices are not ironic. 12. Having characters break out of character is not ironic. Wait, back to humour for a second: Generally, if a joke is told, or a humorous anecdote relayed, and by chance you do not understand that joke or humorous anecdote, it does not mean it is ironic. Or \"neo-ironic\". It simply means that you do not understand that joke. And that is okay. There have been a few readers who have taken the long, messy run-on of the book's end, even that passage, as ironic. Which is so disturbing. A parody of Ulysses? What is wrong with you people? But such interpretations, in the end, aren't really my problem. When I was done, I was ashamed, because I had written what I saw as a much too revealing and maudlin thing, overflowing with blood and sentiment and a simple bare longing for people who are gone. The book was seen by its author as a stupid risk, and an ugly thing, and a betrayal, and overall, as a mistake he would regret for the rest of his life but a mistake which nevertheless he could not refrain from making and, worse, as a mistake he would encourage everyone to make, because everyone should make big, huge mistakes, because a) They don't want you to; b) Because they haven't the balls themselves and your doing it reminds them of their status as havers-of-no-balls; c) Because your life is worth documenting; d) Because if you do not believe your life is worth documenting then why are you wasting your time/our time? Our air? e) Because if you do it right and go straight toward them, you, like me, will write to them and will look straight into their eyes when writing, will look straight into their fucking eyes, like a person sometimes can do with another person, and tell them something, even though you might not know them well, or at all, and even if you wrote in their books or hugged them or put your hand on their arm, you still would scarcely know them, but even so wrote a book that was really a letter to them, a messy fucking letter that you could barely keep a grip on, but a letter you meant, and a letter you sometimes wish you had not mailed, but a letter you are happy that made it from you to them. * What the fuck is ironic about this? \u00a9 Dave Eggers.

      "body": "<p>Gregory Corso, who has died aged 70, was the bad boy of the beat generation. In 1957, he wrote to Allen Ginsberg from Paris to complain that a man who had allowed him to stay in his flat \"came back from his vacation and screamed at me when he saw that I did beautiful oil paintings on his walls and doors\". The injured landlord, Corso added, told Jean Genet what he had done, which brought a telling-off from the poet-thief. Genet, Corso concluded, \"is so fucking bourgeois\".</p> <p>Corso was born to Italian parents in Greenwich Village, New York. Before he was one, his mother abandoned him, and he spent his childhood shuttling between orphanages, reform schools and foster homes, occasionally being rescued by his hopeless father, from whom he tried to escape.</p> <p>By the time he reached his teens, he had been in the children's observation ward at Bellevue hospital and spent five months in the Tombs jail as a material witness to a robbery. At 16, he began a three-year sentence at Clinton state prison, New York, for robbing a household finance office. There, in the classic conversion hitherto experienced by his adversary Genet, he discovered poetry.</p> <p>\"Open this book as you would a box of toys,\" Ginsberg wrote in a preface to Corso's second volume of poems, Gasoline, published by Lawrence Ferlinghetti's City Lights Books in 1958. It was dedicated to \"the angels of Clinton prison who, in my 17th year, handed me, from all the cells surrounding me, books of illumination\".</p> <p>Corso's introduction to the other beats came through Ginsberg, whom he met in a New York bar in 1950. Corso told his new friend that, from his window, he was in the habit of watching a couple in the flat opposite as they undressed, bathed and made love. Later, when Ginsberg invited him to meet his girlfriend, Corso realised that this was the couple he had been watching.</p> <p>Attracted not only to Corso's good looks - Ginsberg was bisexual - and his delinquent background, but also by the sheaf of poems he carried everywhere, Ginsberg welcomed Corso into his circle, introducing him to Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs, and later to the San Francisco poets. Their life of camaraderie and occasional tension is described in Kerouac's novels, The Subterraneans and Desolation Angels. In the former, written in 1953 but not published until five years later, the Kerouac-figure Leo breaks with his girlfriend, Mardou, after discovering she has been sleeping with Corso (Yuri Gligoric).</p> <p>After the succ\u00e8s de scandale of Ginsberg's book Howl in 1957 (the poem was prosecuted in San Francisco, but cleared of obscenity) and the publication of Kerouac's On the Road the same year, Corso became part of the travelling circus of beat poets, which usually comprised himself, Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky.</p> <p>In response to a member of the audience asking, \"What's the message of your poetry?\", Ginsberg might strip off his clothes; or Corso would say, \"Fried shoes\" or \"Poetry is a wose.\" Orlovsky would read two poems, then say he would love to do the third but he had not written it yet. It was the moment when long hair and the philosophy of the unwashed became emblematic of youth's crusade for freedom.</p> <p>In the late 1950s, the same trio lived together in Paris, in what came to be known as the Beat Hotel, in rue Git-le-coeur, near St Michel. For a time, they all slept in the same bed, but eventually Corso found his own room on the top floor, a triangle barely high enough to let him stand up, or wide enough to contain him sleeping. His novel, The American Express, was published by Olympia Press in 1961, and he took part in the original book of cut-ups, Minutes To Go, with Burroughs, Brion Gysin and Sinclair Beiles.</p> <p>Corso's best poetry was metaphysical, in the sense that it recognised no frontier between spirit and matter. But Ginsberg was right; the poem was a place for him to play. Corso talked to Truth (who replied, \"I'll tell awful things about you\"), talked to Faith, Hope and Charity (\"'Without us you'll surely die/ With you I'm going nuts! Goodbye!\") and to Beauty (\"You I loved best in life/ . . . but you're a killer\").</p> <p>Occasionally, as in the elegy for Kerouac in his 1970 collection, Elegiac Feelings American, he tried to use the long, Whitmanesque line so successfully employed by some beat colleagues, but he could not fill it. A promising start, \"How alien the natural home, aye, aye, how dies the tree,\" would plunge into bathos before the end of the phrase, \"when the ground is foreign, cold, unfree\".</p> <p>The poets he loved most were not the moderns, but the English romantics, in particular Keats and Shelley, and the ancients. Like many anti-academy poets of the postwar years, Corso was sucked into university in later life. One student left a record of a class with him at New York University. For the first 15 minutes, he berated them for their ignorance of Greek classics: \"I find somebody dumb who doesn't know Homer - that's how I feel. Check him out. He brought the Greek gods on the scene, that is for sure. But then again, we don't have to be stuck with the Iliad . . .\" He rocks in his chair and checks his wrist for a non-existent watch. \"How long have I been here?\" \"Twenty minutes.\" \"That's a long time, man!\"</p> <p>Although teaching was a way to make a living, Corso never stayed at any one college for long. Nor did he like doing live readings. Heavy drug use in the 1960s and 70s meant that the poverty of his youth continued. When an interviewer inquired about the state of his finances in 1974, he revealed that when he needed money for drugs he would sell one of his poetry notebooks. \"I get about $200 a book,\" he said. \"So a lot of my poems are in the universities and have never been published.\" But, he added, \"the goodies I remember in my head\".</p> <p>Among the many other books and pamphlets he did publish were The Happy Birthday Of Death (1960), The Geometric Poem (1966) and Herald Of the Autochthonic Spirit (1981). A Selected Poems was issued in Britain by Eyre and Spottiswoode in 1962, but like other beat poets, such as Gary Snyder and Ferlinghetti, Corso has been neglected by British publishers.</p> <p>When young, Corso's looks were often described as \"cherubic\", but in later life, with teeth missing and hair uncombed, there was more than a touch of the gargoyle about him. \"Mainly I sleep with my cats and the female,\" he once said, describing his domestic situation. \"I love female. I've been with this one female now for a year.\" One of Ginsberg's later photographs shows him at home with \"the female\" (Kay MacDonagh) and their baby, and quotes a few lines from one of Corso's most famous poems, Marriage (1959): \"and she gives birth to a child and I am sleepless, worn,/ up for nights, head bowed against a quiet window, the past behind me...\"</p> <p>But he remained the bad boy.

      "body": "<p>The setting is the Franco-Spanish border, the time 1940. Walter Benjamin, fleeing occupied France, presents himself to the wife of a certain Fittko he has met at an internment camp. He understands, he says, that Frau Fittko will guide him and his companions across the Pyrenees to neutral Spain. Frau Fittko takes him on a trip to scout out the best routes; he brings along a heavy briefcase. Is the briefcase really necessary, she asks? It contains a manuscript, he replies. \"I cannot risk losing it. It... must be saved. It is more important than I am.\"</p> <p> The next day they cross the mountains, Benjamin pausing every few minutes because of a weak heart. At the border they are halted. Their papers are not in order, say the Spanish police; they must return to France. In despair, Benjamin takes a fatal overdose of morphine. The police make an inventory of the deceased's belongings. The inventory shows no record of a manuscript. What was in the briefcase, and where it disappeared to, we can only guess. </p> <p>Benjamin's friend Gershom Scholem suggested it was the last revision of the unfinished Passagen Werk , or Arcades Project. By his heroic if futile effort to save his manuscript from fascism and bear it to the safety of Spain, Benjamin became an icon of the scholar for our times. The story has a happy twist. A copy of the Arcades manuscript left behind in Paris had been secreted in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale by Benjamin's friend, Georges Bataille. Recovered after the war, it was published in 1982 in its original form - that is to say, in German with huge swathes of French. </p> <p>Now we have Benjamin's magnum opus in full English translation, and are at last in a position to ask the question: why all the interest in a treatise on shopping in 19th-century France? Benjamin was born in 1892, in Berlin, into an assimilated Jewish family. His father was a successful art auctioneer who branched out into property investments; the Benjamins were, by most standards, well-to-do. After a sickly, sheltered childhood, Benjamin was sent at the age of 12 to boarding school, where he was influenced by one of the directors, Gustav Wyneken. </p> <p> For years after leaving school, he was active in Wyneken's anti-authoritarian, back-to-nature youth movement; he broke with it only when Wyneken came out in support of the first world war. In 1912, Benjamin enrolled as a student in philosophy at Freiburg University.</p> <p> Finding the intellectual environment not to his taste, he threw himself into activism for educational reform. When war broke out, he evaded military service first by feigning a medical condition and then, after his marriage in 1917 to Dora Sophie Pollak, by moving to Switzerland. There they stayed until 1920, reading philosophy and working on a doctoral dissertation for the University of Bern; but the lack of a social life unsettled Dora, and they returned to Berlin. Benjamin was drawn to univer sities, remarked his friend Theodor Adorno, as Franz Kafka was drawn to insurance companies. </p> <p>Benjamin set out to acquire the Habilitation (higher doctorate) that would enable him to become a professor, submitting his dissertation, on German drama of the Baroque age, to the University of Frankfurt in 1925. Surprisingly, the dissertation was not accepted. It fell between the stools of literature and philosophy, and Benjamin lacked an academic patron to urge his case. His academic plans having failed, Benjamin launched himself on a career as a translator, broadcaster and freelance journalist. Among his commissions was a translation of Proust's \u00e0 La Recherche du Temps Perdu; three of seven volumes were completed. In 1924, Benjamin visited Capri, at the time a favourite resort of German intellectuals. </p> <p>There he met Asja Lacis, a theatre director from Latvia and committed communist. The meeting was fateful. \"Every time I have experienced a great love, I have undergone a change so fundamental that I have amazed myself,\" he later wrote. \"A genuine love makes me resemble the woman I love.\" In this case, the transformation entailed a change of political direction. </p> <p>\"The path of thinking, progressive persons in their right senses leads to Moscow, not to Palestine,\" Lacis told him. All traces of idealism in his thought, to say nothing of his flirtation with Zionism, were abandoned. His friend Scholem had emigrated to Palestine, expecting Benjamin to follow. Benjamin found an excuse not to come; he kept making excuses to the end. In 1926 Benjamin travelled to Moscow for a rendezvous with Lacis. </p> <p>In his record of the visit, Benjamin probes his own unhappy state of mind, as well as the question of whether he should join the Communist party. Two years later the pair were briefly reunited in Berlin: they lived together and attended meetings of the League of Proletarian- Revolutionary Writers. The liaison precipitated divorce proceedings in which Benjamin behaved with remarkable meanness toward his wife. On the Moscow trip, Benjamin kept a diary which he later revised for publication. </p> <p>He spoke no Russian. Rather than fall back on interpreters, he tried to read Moscow from the outside - what he would later call his physiognomic method - refraining from abstraction or judgment, presenting the city in such a way that \"all factuality is already theory\" (the phrase is from Goethe). Some of Benjamin's claims for the \"world-historical\" experiment he saw being conducted in the USSR now seem naive. Nevertheless his eye was acute. Many new Muscovites were still peasants, he observed, living village lives according to village rhythms. Class distinctions might have been abolished, but within the party a new caste system was evolving. </p> <p>A street market scene captured the humbled status of religion: an icon for sale was flanked by portraits of Lenin \"like a prisoner between two policemen\". Though Lacis is a constant presence in the Moscow diary, and though Benjamin hints that their sexual relations were troubled, we get little sense of her physical self. Benjamin had no gift for evoking other people. In Lacis's writings we get a much livelier impression of Benjamin: his glasses like little spotlights, his clumsy hands. For the rest of his life Benjamin called himself either a communist or a fellow traveller; for years after meeting Lacis, he would repeat Marxist verities - \"the bourgeoisie... is condemned to decline due to internal contradictions that will become fatal as they develop\" - without having read Marx. </p> <p>\"Bourgeois\" remained his cuss word for a mindset - materialistic, incurious, self-satisfied - to which he was viscerally hostile. Proclaiming himself a communist was an act of choosing sides, morally and historically, against the bourgeoisie and his own bourgeois origins. </p> <p>'One thing... can never be made good: having neglected to run away from one's parents,\" he writes in One-Way Street, the collection of diary jottings, dream protocols, aphorisms and mordant observations on Weimar Germany with which he announced himself in 1928. Not having run away early enough meant that he was condemned to run away from Emil and Paula Benjamin for the rest of his life: in reacting against his parents' assimilation into the middle class, he resembled many German-speaking Jews of his generation, including Kafka.</p> <p> What troubled Benjamin's friends about his marxism was that there seemed to be something forced about it, something merely reactive. Benjamin's first ventures into the discourse of the left are depressing to read - rhapsodies on Lenin (whose letters have the \"sweetness of great epic\"), and rehearsals of the ominous euphemisms of the party: \"Communism is not radical. Therefore, it has no intentions of simply abolishing family relations. </p> <p>It merely tests them to determine their capacity for change. It asks: can the family be dismantled so that its components may be socially refunctioned?\" These words come from a review of a play by Bertolt Brecht, whom Benjamin met through Lacis and whose \"crude thinking\", thinking stripped of bourgeois niceties, attracted Benjamin for a while. </p> <p>\"This street is named Asja Lacis Street after her who, like the engineer, cut it through the author,\" runs the dedication to One-Way Street. The comparison is intended as a compliment. The engineer is the man or woman of the future, the one who, impatient of palaver, armed with practical knowledge, acts and acts decisively to change the landscape. (Stalin, too, admired engineers. In his view, writers should become engineers of human souls, meaning that they should take it as their task to \"refunction\" humanity from the inside out.) Of Benjamin's better-known pieces, The Author as Producer (1934) shows the influence of Brecht most clearly. </p> <p> At issue is the old chestnut of Marxist aesthetics: which is more important, form or content? Benjamin proposes that a literary work will be \"politically correct only if it is also literarily correct\". The Author as Producer is a defence of the left wing of the modernist avant-garde, typified for Benjamin by the surrealists, who were against the party's stance on easily comprehensible, realistic stories with a strong progressive tendency. </p> <p> To make his case, Benjamin appeals once again to the glamour of engineering: the writer, like the engineer, is a technical specialist and should have a voice in technical matters. Arguing at this crude level did not come easily to Benjamin. Did his faithfulness to the party cause him no unease at a time when Stalin's persecution of artists was in full swing? (Lacis herself was to become one of Stalin's victims, spending years in a labour camp.) </p> <p> A brief piece from 1934 may give a clue. Here Benjamin mocks intellectuals who \"make it a point of honour to be wholly themselves on every issue\", refusing to understand that to succeed they have to present different faces to different audiences. They are, he says, like a butcher who refuses to cut up a carcass, insisting on selling it whole. How does one read this piece? Is Benjamin ironically praising old-fashioned intellectual integrity? Is he issuing a veiled confession that he, Benjamin, is not what he seems to be? Is he making a practical, if bitter, point about the hack writer's life? A letter to Scholem (to whom he did not always, however, tell the whole truth) suggests the last reading. Here Benjamin defends his communism as \"the obvious, reasoned attempt of a man who is deprived of any means of production to proclaim his right to them\".</p> <p> In other words, he follows the party for the same reason that any proletarian should: because it is in his material interest. By the time the Nazis came to power, many of Benjamin's associates, including Brecht, had read the writing on the wall and taken flight. Benjamin, who had felt out of place in Germany for years, soon followed. (His younger brother Georg was less prudent: arrested for political activities in 1934, he perished in Mauthausen concentration camp in 1942.) </p> <p>Benjamin settled in Paris, where he scratched a precarious existence contributing to German newspapers under Aryan pseudonyms (Detlef Holz, KA Stemplinger) and living on handouts. With the outbreak of war, he found himself interned as an enemy alien. Released through the efforts of French PEN [the world association of writers], he made arrangements to flee to the United States, then set off on his fatal journey to the Spanish border. Benjamin's keenest insights into fascism - the enemy that deprived him of a home and a career and ultimately killed him - concern the means it used to sell itself to the German people: by turning itself into theatre. </p> <p> It is commonplace to observe that Hitler's Nuremberg rallies, with their combination of declamation, hypnotic music, mass choreography and dramatic lighting, found their model in Wagner's Bayreuth productions. What is original in Benjamin is his claim that politics as grandiose theatre, rather than as debate, was not just one of the trappings of fascism, but fascism in essence. In the films of Leni Riefenstahl, as well as in newsreels exhibited in every theatre in the land, the German masses were offered images of themselves as their leaders called upon them to be. Fascism used the power of the art of the past - what Benjamin calls \"auratic art\" - plus the multiplying power of the new postauratic media, particularly cinema, to create its new fascist citizens.</p> <p> For ordinary Germans, the only identity on show was a fascist identity in fascist costume and fascist postures of domination or obedience. Benjamin's analysis of fascism as theatre raises many questions. Is politics as spectacle really the heart of German fascism, rather than ressentiment and dreams of historical retribution? If Nuremberg was aestheticised politics, why were Stalin's May Day extravaganzas and show trials not aestheticised politics too? If the genius of fascism was to erase the line between politics and media, where is the fascist element in the media-driven politics of western democracies? Are there not different varieties of aesthetic politics? </p> <p>The key concept that Benjamin invents (though his diary hints it was in fact the brainchild of the bookseller and publisher Adrienne Monnier) to describe what happens to the work of art in the age of technological reproducibility (principally the age of the camera - Benjamin has little to say about printing) is the loss of aura. Until roughly the middle of the 19th century, he says, an inter-subjective relationship of a kind survived between an artwork and its viewer: \"To perceive the aura of a phenomenon [means] to invest it with a capacity to look at us in turn.\" There is thus something magical about aura, derived from ancient links, now wandering between art and religious ritual. </p> <p>Benjamin first speaks of aura in his Little History of Photography (1931), where he tries to explain why it is that, in his eyes, the very earliest portrait photographs - the incunabula of photography - have auras, whereas photographs of a generation later have lost them. In The Work of Art, the notion of aura is extended rather recklessly from old photographs to works of art in general. The end of aura, says Benjamin, will be more than compensated for by the emancipatory capacities of the new technologies of reproduction. Cinema will replace auratic art. </p> <p>Even Benjamin's friends found it hard to get a grip on aura. Brecht, to whom Benjamin expounded the concept during lengthy visits to Brecht's home in Denmark, writes as follows in his diary. \"[Benjamin] says: when you feel someone's gaze alight upon you... you respond (!). The expectation that whatever you look at is looking at you creates the aura... This is the way in which the materialist approach to history is adapted! It is pretty horrifying.\" </p> <p> Throughout the 1930s Benjamin struggled to develop an acceptably materialist definition of aura and loss of aura. Film is postauratic, he says, because the camera, being an instrument, cannot see. (A questionable claim: actors respond to the camera as if it is looking at them.) In a later revision he suggests that the end of aura can be dated to the moment in history when urban crowds grew so dense that people - passers-by - no longer returned one another's gaze. In the Arcades Project he makes the loss of aura part of a wider development: the spread of a disenchanted awareness that uniqueness, including the uniqueness of the traditional artwork, has become a commod ity like any other commodity. The fashion industry, dedicated to the fabrication of unique handiworks intended to be reproduced on a mass scale, points the way here. </p> <p>In the late 1920s Benjamin conceived of a work that would deal with urban experience; inspired by the arcades of Paris, it would be a version of the Sleeping Beauty story, a dialectical fairy tale told surrealistically by means of a montage of fragmentary texts. Like the prince's kiss, it would awaken the European masses to the truth of their lives under capitalism. It would be 50 pages long; in preparation for its writing, Benjamin began to copy out quotations under such headings as Boredom, Fashion, Dust. </p> <p>But as a stitched-together text, it became overgrown each time with new quotations and notes. He discussed his problems with Adorno and Max Horkheimer, who convinced him he could not write about capitalism without a proper command of Marx. The Sleeping Beauty idea lost its lustre. </p> <p>By 1934 Benjamin had a new, more philosophically ambitious plan: using the same method of montage, he would trace the cultural superstructure of 19th-century France back to commodities and their power to become fetishes. As his notes grew in bulk, he slotted them into an elaborate filing system based on 36 convolutes (from German Konvolut : sheaf, dossier) with keywords and cross-references. Under the title \"Paris, Capital of the 19th Century\" he wrote a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the material, which he offered to Adorno (he was by then receiving a stipend from, and was thus in some measure beholden to, the Institute for Social Research, which had been relocated by Adorno and Horkheimer from Frankfurt to New York). </p> <p>From Adorno, Benjamin received such severe criticism that he decided to set aside the project and extract from his mass of materials a book about Baudelaire. Adorno saw part of the book and was again critical: facts were made to speak for themselves, he said; there was not enough theory. Benjamin made further revisions, which had a warmer reception. </p> <p>Baudelaire was central to the Arcades plan because, in Benjamin's eyes, Les Fleurs du Mal first revealed the modern city as a subject for poetry. (Benjamin seems not to have read Wordsworth, who, 50 years before Baudelaire, wrote of what it was like to be part of a street crowd, bombarded on all sides with glances, dazzled with advertisements.) </p> <p>Yet Baudelaire expressed his experience of the city in allegory, a literary mode out of fashion since the Baroque. In Le Cygne, for instance, he allegorises the poet as a swan, scrabbling comically in the paved marketplace, unable to spread his wings and soar. </p> <p>Why did Baudelaire opt for the allegorical mode? Benjamin uses Marx's Kapital to answer his question. The elevation of market value into the sole measure of worth, says Marx, reduces a commodity to nothing but a sign - the sign of what it will sell for. Under the reign of the market, things relate to their actual worth as arbitrarily as, for instance, in baroque emblematics, a death's head relates to man's subjection to time. Emblems thus make an unexpected return to the historical stage in the form of commodities which, as Marx had warned, \"(abound) in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties\". Allegory, Benjamin argues, is exactly the right mode for an age of commodities. </p> <p>While working on the never-completed Baudelaire book, Benjamin continued to take notes for the Arcades. What was recovered after the war from its hiding place in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale amounted to some 900 pages of extracts, mainly from 19th-century writers but from contemporaries of Benjamin's as well, grouped under headings, with interspersed commentary, plus a variety of plans and synopses. </p> <p> The history of the Arcades Project, a history of procrastination and false starts, of wanderings in archival labyrinths in a quest for exhaustiveness, of shifting theoretical ground, of criticism too readily acted on, and generally speaking of Benjamin not knowing his own mind, means that the book we are left with is radically incomplete: incompletely conceived and hardly written in any conventional sense. Rolf Tiedemann, who published an edition of the work in 1982, compares it to the building materials of a house. In the hypothetical completed house the materials would be held together by Benjamin's thought. We possess much of that thought in the form of Benjamin's interpolations, but cannot always see how the thought fits or encompasses the material. </p> <p>In such a situation, says Tiedemann, it might seem better to publish only Benjamin's own words, leaving out the quotations. But Benjamin's intention, however utopian, was that at some point his commentary would be withdrawn, leaving the quoted material to bear the full weight of the structure. </p> <p>The arcades of Paris, says an 1852 guidebook, are \"inner boulevards, glass-roofed, marble-panelled corridors extending through blocks of buildings... lining both sides... are the most elegant shops, so that such an arcade is a city, a world in miniature\". Their airy glass and steel architecture was soon imitated in other cities of the west. The heyday of arcades extended to the end of the century, when they were eclipsed by department stores. </p> <p>The Arcades book was never intended to be an economic history (though part of its ambition was to act as a corrective to the entire discipline of economic history). An early sketch suggests something far more like his autobiographical work, A Berlin Childhood. \"One knew of places in ancient Greece where the way led down into the underworld. Our waking existence likewise is a land which, at certain hidden points, leads down into the underworld - a land full of inconspicuous places from which dreams arise. All day long, suspecting nothing, we pass them by, but no sooner has sleep come than we are groping our way back to lose ourselves in the dark corridors. By day, the labyrinth of urban dwelling resembles consciousness; the arcades... issue unremarked on to the streets. At night, however, under the tenebrous mass of the houses, their denser darkness protrudes like a threat, and the nocturnal pedestrian hurries past - unless, that is, we have emboldened him to turn into a narrow lane.\" </p> <p>Two books served Benjamin as models: Louis Aragon's A Paris Peasant, with its affectionate tribute to the Passage de L'Op\u00e9ra, and Franz Hessel's Strolling in Berlin, which focuses on the Kaisergalerie and its power to summon up the feel of a bygone era. In his book, Benjamin would try to capture the \"phantasmagoric\" experience of the Parisian wandering among displays of goods, an experience still recoverable in his own day, when \"arcades dot the metropolitan landscape like caves containing the fossil remains of a vanished monster: the consumer of the pre-imperial era of capitalism, the last dinosaur of Europe\". </p> <p>The great innovation of the Arcades Project would be its form. It would work on the principle of montage, juxtaposing textual fragments from past and present in the expectation that they would strike sparks from and illuminate each other. Thus, for instance, if item 2,1 of convolute L, referring to the opening of an art museum at the palace of Versailles in 1837, is read in conjunction with item 2,4 of convolute A, which traces the development of arcades into department stores, then ideally the analogy \"museum is to department store as artwork is to commodity\" will flash into the reader's mind. </p> <p>According to Max Weber, what marks the modern world is loss of belief, disenchantment. Benjamin has a different angle: that capitalism has put people to sleep, that they will wake up from their collective enchantment only when they are made to understand what has happened to them. The inscription to convolute N comes from Marx: \"The reform of consciousness consists solely in... the awakening of the world from its dream about itself.\" </p> <p>The dreams of the capitalist era are embodied in commodities. In their ensemble these constitute a phantasmagoria, constantly changing shape according to the tides of fashion, and offered to crowds of enchanted worshippers as the embodiment of their deepest desires. The phantasmagoria always hides its origins (which lie in alienated labour). Phantasmagoria in Benjamin is thus a little like ideology in Marx - a tissue of public lies sustained by the power of capital - but is more like Freudian dreamwork operating at a collective, social level. </p> <p>\"I needn't say anything. Merely show,\" says Benjamin; and elsewhere: \"Ideas are to objects as constellations are to stars.\" If the mosaic of quotations is built up correctly, a pattern should emerge that is more than the sum of its parts but which cannot exist independently of them: this is the essence of the new form of historical-materialistic writing that Benjamin believed himself to be practising. </p> <p> What dismayed Adorno about the project in 1935 was Benjamin's faith that a mere assemblage of objects could speak for itself. Benjamin was, he wrote, \"on the crossroads between magic and positivism\". Adorno later had a chance to see the entire Arcades corpus, and again expressed doubts about the thinness of its theorising. Benjamin's response was to invent the notion of the dialectical image, for which he went back to baroque emblematics - ideas represented by pictures and Baudelairean allegory. Allegory, he suggested, could take over the role of abstract thought. </p> <p>The objects and figures that inhabit the arcades - gamblers, whores, mirrors, dust, wax figures - are to Benjamin emblems, and their interactions generate meanings, allegorical meanings that do not need the intrusion of theory. Along the same lines, fragments of text taken from the past and placed in the charged field of the historical present are capable of behaving much as the elements of a surrealist image do, interacting spontaneously to give off political energy. In so doing the fragments constitute the dialectical image, dialectical movement frozen for a moment, open for inspection, dialectics at a standstill: \"Only dialectical images are genuine images.\" </p> <p>So much for the theory, ingenious as it is, to which Benjamin's deeply anti-theoretical book appeals. But to the reader unpersuaded by the theory, the reader to whom the dialectical images never quite come alive as they are supposed to, the reader perhaps unreceptive to the master narrative of the long sleep of capitalism followed by the dawn of socialism, what does the Arcades Project have to offer? The briefest of lists would include: a treasure hoard of curious information about Paris, a multitude of thought-provoking questions, the harvest of an acute and idiosyncratic mind's trawl through thousands of books, succinct observations, pol ished to a high aphoristic sheen, on a range of subjects (example: \"Prostitution can lay claim to being considered 'work' the moment work becomes prostitution\"); and glimpses of Benjamin toying with a new way of seeing himself: as a compiler of a \"magic encyclopaedia\". Suddenly Benjamin, esoteric reader of an allegorical city, seems close to his contemporary Jorge Luis Borges, fabulist of a rewritten universe. </p> <p>From a distance, Benjamin's magnificent opus is reminiscent of another great ruin of 20th- century literature, Ezra Pound's Cantos. Both works are built out of fragments, and adhere to the high-modernist aesthetics of image and montage. Both have economic ambitions and economists as presiding figures (Marx in one case, Gesell and Douglas in the other). Both authors have investments in antiquarian bodies of knowledge whose relevance to their own times they overestimate. Neither knows when to stop. And both were in the end consumed by the monster of fascism: Benjamin tragically, Pound shamefully. </p> <p>It has been the fate of the Cantos to have a handful of anthology pieces excerpted and the rest quietly dropped. The fate of the Arcades may well be similar. One can foresee a condensed student edition drawn mainly from convolutes B (Fashion), H (The Collector), I (The Interior), J (Baudelaire), K (Dream City), N (On the Theory of Knowledge) and Y (Photo- graphy), in which the quotations will be cut to a minimum and most of the surviving text will be by Benjamin himself. And that would not be a wholly bad thing. </p> <p>What was Walter Benjamin: a philosopher? A critic? A historian? A mere \"writer\"? The best answer is perhaps Hannah Arendt's: he was one of \"the unclassifiable ones... whose work neither fits the existing order nor introduces a new genre\". </p> <p>His trademark approach - coming at a subject not straight on but at an angle, moving stepwise from one perfectly formulated summation to the next - is as instantly recognisable as it is inimitable, depending on sharpness of intellect, learning lightly worn and a prose style which, once he had given up thinking of himself as Professor Benjamin, became a marvel of accuracy and concision. Underlying his project of getting at the truth of our times is an ideal he found expressed in Goethe: to set out the facts in such a way that the facts will be their own theory. </p> <p>The Arcades book, whatever our verdict on it - ruin, failure, impossible project - suggests a new way of writing about a civilisation using its rubbish as materials rather than its artworks: history from below rather than above. And his call elsewhere for a history centred on the sufferings of the vanquished, rather than on the achievements of the victors, is prophetic of the way in which history writing has begun to think of itself in our lifetime. </p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited extract from an article that first appeared in the New York Review of Books.

      "bodyText": "The setting is the Franco-Spanish border, the time 1940. Walter Benjamin, fleeing occupied France, presents himself to the wife of a certain Fittko he has met at an internment camp. He understands, he says, that Frau Fittko will guide him and his companions across the Pyrenees to neutral Spain. Frau Fittko takes him on a trip to scout out the best routes; he brings along a heavy briefcase. Is the briefcase really necessary, she asks? It contains a manuscript, he replies. \"I cannot risk losing it. It... must be saved. It is more important than I am.\" The next day they cross the mountains, Benjamin pausing every few minutes because of a weak heart. At the border they are halted. Their papers are not in order, say the Spanish police; they must return to France. In despair, Benjamin takes a fatal overdose of morphine. The police make an inventory of the deceased's belongings. The inventory shows no record of a manuscript. What was in the briefcase, and where it disappeared to, we can only guess. Benjamin's friend Gershom Scholem suggested it was the last revision of the unfinished Passagen Werk , or Arcades Project. By his heroic if futile effort to save his manuscript from fascism and bear it to the safety of Spain, Benjamin became an icon of the scholar for our times. The story has a happy twist. A copy of the Arcades manuscript left behind in Paris had been secreted in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale by Benjamin's friend, Georges Bataille. Recovered after the war, it was published in 1982 in its original form - that is to say, in German with huge swathes of French. Now we have Benjamin's magnum opus in full English translation, and are at last in a position to ask the question: why all the interest in a treatise on shopping in 19th-century France? Benjamin was born in 1892, in Berlin, into an assimilated Jewish family. His father was a successful art auctioneer who branched out into property investments; the Benjamins were, by most standards, well-to-do. After a sickly, sheltered childhood, Benjamin was sent at the age of 12 to boarding school, where he was influenced by one of the directors, Gustav Wyneken. For years after leaving school, he was active in Wyneken's anti-authoritarian, back-to-nature youth movement; he broke with it only when Wyneken came out in support of the first world war. In 1912, Benjamin enrolled as a student in philosophy at Freiburg University. Finding the intellectual environment not to his taste, he threw himself into activism for educational reform. When war broke out, he evaded military service first by feigning a medical condition and then, after his marriage in 1917 to Dora Sophie Pollak, by moving to Switzerland. There they stayed until 1920, reading philosophy and working on a doctoral dissertation for the University of Bern; but the lack of a social life unsettled Dora, and they returned to Berlin. Benjamin was drawn to univer sities, remarked his friend Theodor Adorno, as Franz Kafka was drawn to insurance companies. Benjamin set out to acquire the Habilitation (higher doctorate) that would enable him to become a professor, submitting his dissertation, on German drama of the Baroque age, to the University of Frankfurt in 1925. Surprisingly, the dissertation was not accepted. It fell between the stools of literature and philosophy, and Benjamin lacked an academic patron to urge his case. His academic plans having failed, Benjamin launched himself on a career as a translator, broadcaster and freelance journalist. Among his commissions was a translation of Proust's \u00e0 La Recherche du Temps Perdu; three of seven volumes were completed. In 1924, Benjamin visited Capri, at the time a favourite resort of German intellectuals. There he met Asja Lacis, a theatre director from Latvia and committed communist. The meeting was fateful. \"Every time I have experienced a great love, I have undergone a change so fundamental that I have amazed myself,\" he later wrote. \"A genuine love makes me resemble the woman I love.\" In this case, the transformation entailed a change of political direction. \"The path of thinking, progressive persons in their right senses leads to Moscow, not to Palestine,\" Lacis told him. All traces of idealism in his thought, to say nothing of his flirtation with Zionism, were abandoned. His friend Scholem had emigrated to Palestine, expecting Benjamin to follow. Benjamin found an excuse not to come; he kept making excuses to the end. In 1926 Benjamin travelled to Moscow for a rendezvous with Lacis. In his record of the visit, Benjamin probes his own unhappy state of mind, as well as the question of whether he should join the Communist party. Two years later the pair were briefly reunited in Berlin: they lived together and attended meetings of the League of Proletarian- Revolutionary Writers. The liaison precipitated divorce proceedings in which Benjamin behaved with remarkable meanness toward his wife. On the Moscow trip, Benjamin kept a diary which he later revised for publication. He spoke no Russian. Rather than fall back on interpreters, he tried to read Moscow from the outside - what he would later call his physiognomic method - refraining from abstraction or judgment, presenting the city in such a way that \"all factuality is already theory\" (the phrase is from Goethe). Some of Benjamin's claims for the \"world-historical\" experiment he saw being conducted in the USSR now seem naive. Nevertheless his eye was acute. Many new Muscovites were still peasants, he observed, living village lives according to village rhythms. Class distinctions might have been abolished, but within the party a new caste system was evolving. A street market scene captured the humbled status of religion: an icon for sale was flanked by portraits of Lenin \"like a prisoner between two policemen\". Though Lacis is a constant presence in the Moscow diary, and though Benjamin hints that their sexual relations were troubled, we get little sense of her physical self. Benjamin had no gift for evoking other people. In Lacis's writings we get a much livelier impression of Benjamin: his glasses like little spotlights, his clumsy hands. For the rest of his life Benjamin called himself either a communist or a fellow traveller; for years after meeting Lacis, he would repeat Marxist verities - \"the bourgeoisie... is condemned to decline due to internal contradictions that will become fatal as they develop\" - without having read Marx. \"Bourgeois\" remained his cuss word for a mindset - materialistic, incurious, self-satisfied - to which he was viscerally hostile. Proclaiming himself a communist was an act of choosing sides, morally and historically, against the bourgeoisie and his own bourgeois origins. 'One thing... can never be made good: having neglected to run away from one's parents,\" he writes in One-Way Street, the collection of diary jottings, dream protocols, aphorisms and mordant observations on Weimar Germany with which he announced himself in 1928. Not having run away early enough meant that he was condemned to run away from Emil and Paula Benjamin for the rest of his life: in reacting against his parents' assimilation into the middle class, he resembled many German-speaking Jews of his generation, including Kafka. What troubled Benjamin's friends about his marxism was that there seemed to be something forced about it, something merely reactive. Benjamin's first ventures into the discourse of the left are depressing to read - rhapsodies on Lenin (whose letters have the \"sweetness of great epic\"), and rehearsals of the ominous euphemisms of the party: \"Communism is not radical. Therefore, it has no intentions of simply abolishing family relations. It merely tests them to determine their capacity for change. It asks: can the family be dismantled so that its components may be socially refunctioned?\" These words come from a review of a play by Bertolt Brecht, whom Benjamin met through Lacis and whose \"crude thinking\", thinking stripped of bourgeois niceties, attracted Benjamin for a while. \"This street is named Asja Lacis Street after her who, like the engineer, cut it through the author,\" runs the dedication to One-Way Street. The comparison is intended as a compliment. The engineer is the man or woman of the future, the one who, impatient of palaver, armed with practical knowledge, acts and acts decisively to change the landscape. (Stalin, too, admired engineers. In his view, writers should become engineers of human souls, meaning that they should take it as their task to \"refunction\" humanity from the inside out.) Of Benjamin's better-known pieces, The Author as Producer (1934) shows the influence of Brecht most clearly. At issue is the old chestnut of Marxist aesthetics: which is more important, form or content? Benjamin proposes that a literary work will be \"politically correct only if it is also literarily correct\". The Author as Producer is a defence of the left wing of the modernist avant-garde, typified for Benjamin by the surrealists, who were against the party's stance on easily comprehensible, realistic stories with a strong progressive tendency. To make his case, Benjamin appeals once again to the glamour of engineering: the writer, like the engineer, is a technical specialist and should have a voice in technical matters. Arguing at this crude level did not come easily to Benjamin. Did his faithfulness to the party cause him no unease at a time when Stalin's persecution of artists was in full swing? (Lacis herself was to become one of Stalin's victims, spending years in a labour camp.) A brief piece from 1934 may give a clue. Here Benjamin mocks intellectuals who \"make it a point of honour to be wholly themselves on every issue\", refusing to understand that to succeed they have to present different faces to different audiences. They are, he says, like a butcher who refuses to cut up a carcass, insisting on selling it whole. How does one read this piece? Is Benjamin ironically praising old-fashioned intellectual integrity? Is he issuing a veiled confession that he, Benjamin, is not what he seems to be? Is he making a practical, if bitter, point about the hack writer's life? A letter to Scholem (to whom he did not always, however, tell the whole truth) suggests the last reading. Here Benjamin defends his communism as \"the obvious, reasoned attempt of a man who is deprived of any means of production to proclaim his right to them\". In other words, he follows the party for the same reason that any proletarian should: because it is in his material interest. By the time the Nazis came to power, many of Benjamin's associates, including Brecht, had read the writing on the wall and taken flight. Benjamin, who had felt out of place in Germany for years, soon followed. (His younger brother Georg was less prudent: arrested for political activities in 1934, he perished in Mauthausen concentration camp in 1942.) Benjamin settled in Paris, where he scratched a precarious existence contributing to German newspapers under Aryan pseudonyms (Detlef Holz, KA Stemplinger) and living on handouts. With the outbreak of war, he found himself interned as an enemy alien. Released through the efforts of French PEN [the world association of writers], he made arrangements to flee to the United States, then set off on his fatal journey to the Spanish border. Benjamin's keenest insights into fascism - the enemy that deprived him of a home and a career and ultimately killed him - concern the means it used to sell itself to the German people: by turning itself into theatre. It is commonplace to observe that Hitler's Nuremberg rallies, with their combination of declamation, hypnotic music, mass choreography and dramatic lighting, found their model in Wagner's Bayreuth productions. What is original in Benjamin is his claim that politics as grandiose theatre, rather than as debate, was not just one of the trappings of fascism, but fascism in essence. In the films of Leni Riefenstahl, as well as in newsreels exhibited in every theatre in the land, the German masses were offered images of themselves as their leaders called upon them to be. Fascism used the power of the art of the past - what Benjamin calls \"auratic art\" - plus the multiplying power of the new postauratic media, particularly cinema, to create its new fascist citizens. For ordinary Germans, the only identity on show was a fascist identity in fascist costume and fascist postures of domination or obedience. Benjamin's analysis of fascism as theatre raises many questions. Is politics as spectacle really the heart of German fascism, rather than ressentiment and dreams of historical retribution? If Nuremberg was aestheticised politics, why were Stalin's May Day extravaganzas and show trials not aestheticised politics too? If the genius of fascism was to erase the line between politics and media, where is the fascist element in the media-driven politics of western democracies? Are there not different varieties of aesthetic politics? The key concept that Benjamin invents (though his diary hints it was in fact the brainchild of the bookseller and publisher Adrienne Monnier) to describe what happens to the work of art in the age of technological reproducibility (principally the age of the camera - Benjamin has little to say about printing) is the loss of aura. Until roughly the middle of the 19th century, he says, an inter-subjective relationship of a kind survived between an artwork and its viewer: \"To perceive the aura of a phenomenon [means] to invest it with a capacity to look at us in turn.\" There is thus something magical about aura, derived from ancient links, now wandering between art and religious ritual. Benjamin first speaks of aura in his Little History of Photography (1931), where he tries to explain why it is that, in his eyes, the very earliest portrait photographs - the incunabula of photography - have auras, whereas photographs of a generation later have lost them. In The Work of Art, the notion of aura is extended rather recklessly from old photographs to works of art in general. The end of aura, says Benjamin, will be more than compensated for by the emancipatory capacities of the new technologies of reproduction. Cinema will replace auratic art. Even Benjamin's friends found it hard to get a grip on aura. Brecht, to whom Benjamin expounded the concept during lengthy visits to Brecht's home in Denmark, writes as follows in his diary. \"[Benjamin] says: when you feel someone's gaze alight upon you... you respond (!). The expectation that whatever you look at is looking at you creates the aura... This is the way in which the materialist approach to history is adapted! It is pretty horrifying.\" Throughout the 1930s Benjamin struggled to develop an acceptably materialist definition of aura and loss of aura. Film is postauratic, he says, because the camera, being an instrument, cannot see. (A questionable claim: actors respond to the camera as if it is looking at them.) In a later revision he suggests that the end of aura can be dated to the moment in history when urban crowds grew so dense that people - passers-by - no longer returned one another's gaze. In the Arcades Project he makes the loss of aura part of a wider development: the spread of a disenchanted awareness that uniqueness, including the uniqueness of the traditional artwork, has become a commod ity like any other commodity. The fashion industry, dedicated to the fabrication of unique handiworks intended to be reproduced on a mass scale, points the way here. In the late 1920s Benjamin conceived of a work that would deal with urban experience; inspired by the arcades of Paris, it would be a version of the Sleeping Beauty story, a dialectical fairy tale told surrealistically by means of a montage of fragmentary texts. Like the prince's kiss, it would awaken the European masses to the truth of their lives under capitalism. It would be 50 pages long; in preparation for its writing, Benjamin began to copy out quotations under such headings as Boredom, Fashion, Dust. But as a stitched-together text, it became overgrown each time with new quotations and notes. He discussed his problems with Adorno and Max Horkheimer, who convinced him he could not write about capitalism without a proper command of Marx. The Sleeping Beauty idea lost its lustre. By 1934 Benjamin had a new, more philosophically ambitious plan: using the same method of montage, he would trace the cultural superstructure of 19th-century France back to commodities and their power to become fetishes. As his notes grew in bulk, he slotted them into an elaborate filing system based on 36 convolutes (from German Konvolut : sheaf, dossier) with keywords and cross-references. Under the title \"Paris, Capital of the 19th Century\" he wrote a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the material, which he offered to Adorno (he was by then receiving a stipend from, and was thus in some measure beholden to, the Institute for Social Research, which had been relocated by Adorno and Horkheimer from Frankfurt to New York). From Adorno, Benjamin received such severe criticism that he decided to set aside the project and extract from his mass of materials a book about Baudelaire. Adorno saw part of the book and was again critical: facts were made to speak for themselves, he said; there was not enough theory. Benjamin made further revisions, which had a warmer reception. Baudelaire was central to the Arcades plan because, in Benjamin's eyes, Les Fleurs du Mal first revealed the modern city as a subject for poetry. (Benjamin seems not to have read Wordsworth, who, 50 years before Baudelaire, wrote of what it was like to be part of a street crowd, bombarded on all sides with glances, dazzled with advertisements.) Yet Baudelaire expressed his experience of the city in allegory, a literary mode out of fashion since the Baroque. In Le Cygne, for instance, he allegorises the poet as a swan, scrabbling comically in the paved marketplace, unable to spread his wings and soar. Why did Baudelaire opt for the allegorical mode? Benjamin uses Marx's Kapital to answer his question. The elevation of market value into the sole measure of worth, says Marx, reduces a commodity to nothing but a sign - the sign of what it will sell for. Under the reign of the market, things relate to their actual worth as arbitrarily as, for instance, in baroque emblematics, a death's head relates to man's subjection to time. Emblems thus make an unexpected return to the historical stage in the form of commodities which, as Marx had warned, \"(abound) in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties\". Allegory, Benjamin argues, is exactly the right mode for an age of commodities. While working on the never-completed Baudelaire book, Benjamin continued to take notes for the Arcades. What was recovered after the war from its hiding place in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale amounted to some 900 pages of extracts, mainly from 19th-century writers but from contemporaries of Benjamin's as well, grouped under headings, with interspersed commentary, plus a variety of plans and synopses. The history of the Arcades Project, a history of procrastination and false starts, of wanderings in archival labyrinths in a quest for exhaustiveness, of shifting theoretical ground, of criticism too readily acted on, and generally speaking of Benjamin not knowing his own mind, means that the book we are left with is radically incomplete: incompletely conceived and hardly written in any conventional sense. Rolf Tiedemann, who published an edition of the work in 1982, compares it to the building materials of a house. In the hypothetical completed house the materials would be held together by Benjamin's thought. We possess much of that thought in the form of Benjamin's interpolations, but cannot always see how the thought fits or encompasses the material. In such a situation, says Tiedemann, it might seem better to publish only Benjamin's own words, leaving out the quotations. But Benjamin's intention, however utopian, was that at some point his commentary would be withdrawn, leaving the quoted material to bear the full weight of the structure. The arcades of Paris, says an 1852 guidebook, are \"inner boulevards, glass-roofed, marble-panelled corridors extending through blocks of buildings... lining both sides... are the most elegant shops, so that such an arcade is a city, a world in miniature\". Their airy glass and steel architecture was soon imitated in other cities of the west. The heyday of arcades extended to the end of the century, when they were eclipsed by department stores. The Arcades book was never intended to be an economic history (though part of its ambition was to act as a corrective to the entire discipline of economic history). An early sketch suggests something far more like his autobiographical work, A Berlin Childhood. \"One knew of places in ancient Greece where the way led down into the underworld. Our waking existence likewise is a land which, at certain hidden points, leads down into the underworld - a land full of inconspicuous places from which dreams arise. All day long, suspecting nothing, we pass them by, but no sooner has sleep come than we are groping our way back to lose ourselves in the dark corridors. By day, the labyrinth of urban dwelling resembles consciousness; the arcades... issue unremarked on to the streets. At night, however, under the tenebrous mass of the houses, their denser darkness protrudes like a threat, and the nocturnal pedestrian hurries past - unless, that is, we have emboldened him to turn into a narrow lane.\" Two books served Benjamin as models: Louis Aragon's A Paris Peasant, with its affectionate tribute to the Passage de L'Op\u00e9ra, and Franz Hessel's Strolling in Berlin, which focuses on the Kaisergalerie and its power to summon up the feel of a bygone era. In his book, Benjamin would try to capture the \"phantasmagoric\" experience of the Parisian wandering among displays of goods, an experience still recoverable in his own day, when \"arcades dot the metropolitan landscape like caves containing the fossil remains of a vanished monster: the consumer of the pre-imperial era of capitalism, the last dinosaur of Europe\". The great innovation of the Arcades Project would be its form. It would work on the principle of montage, juxtaposing textual fragments from past and present in the expectation that they would strike sparks from and illuminate each other. Thus, for instance, if item 2,1 of convolute L, referring to the opening of an art museum at the palace of Versailles in 1837, is read in conjunction with item 2,4 of convolute A, which traces the development of arcades into department stores, then ideally the analogy \"museum is to department store as artwork is to commodity\" will flash into the reader's mind. According to Max Weber, what marks the modern world is loss of belief, disenchantment. Benjamin has a different angle: that capitalism has put people to sleep, that they will wake up from their collective enchantment only when they are made to understand what has happened to them. The inscription to convolute N comes from Marx: \"The reform of consciousness consists solely in... the awakening of the world from its dream about itself.\" The dreams of the capitalist era are embodied in commodities. In their ensemble these constitute a phantasmagoria, constantly changing shape according to the tides of fashion, and offered to crowds of enchanted worshippers as the embodiment of their deepest desires. The phantasmagoria always hides its origins (which lie in alienated labour). Phantasmagoria in Benjamin is thus a little like ideology in Marx - a tissue of public lies sustained by the power of capital - but is more like Freudian dreamwork operating at a collective, social level. \"I needn't say anything. Merely show,\" says Benjamin; and elsewhere: \"Ideas are to objects as constellations are to stars.\" If the mosaic of quotations is built up correctly, a pattern should emerge that is more than the sum of its parts but which cannot exist independently of them: this is the essence of the new form of historical-materialistic writing that Benjamin believed himself to be practising. What dismayed Adorno about the project in 1935 was Benjamin's faith that a mere assemblage of objects could speak for itself. Benjamin was, he wrote, \"on the crossroads between magic and positivism\". Adorno later had a chance to see the entire Arcades corpus, and again expressed doubts about the thinness of its theorising. Benjamin's response was to invent the notion of the dialectical image, for which he went back to baroque emblematics - ideas represented by pictures and Baudelairean allegory. Allegory, he suggested, could take over the role of abstract thought. The objects and figures that inhabit the arcades - gamblers, whores, mirrors, dust, wax figures - are to Benjamin emblems, and their interactions generate meanings, allegorical meanings that do not need the intrusion of theory. Along the same lines, fragments of text taken from the past and placed in the charged field of the historical present are capable of behaving much as the elements of a surrealist image do, interacting spontaneously to give off political energy. In so doing the fragments constitute the dialectical image, dialectical movement frozen for a moment, open for inspection, dialectics at a standstill: \"Only dialectical images are genuine images.\" So much for the theory, ingenious as it is, to which Benjamin's deeply anti-theoretical book appeals. But to the reader unpersuaded by the theory, the reader to whom the dialectical images never quite come alive as they are supposed to, the reader perhaps unreceptive to the master narrative of the long sleep of capitalism followed by the dawn of socialism, what does the Arcades Project have to offer? The briefest of lists would include: a treasure hoard of curious information about Paris, a multitude of thought-provoking questions, the harvest of an acute and idiosyncratic mind's trawl through thousands of books, succinct observations, pol ished to a high aphoristic sheen, on a range of subjects (example: \"Prostitution can lay claim to being considered 'work' the moment work becomes prostitution\"); and glimpses of Benjamin toying with a new way of seeing himself: as a compiler of a \"magic encyclopaedia\". Suddenly Benjamin, esoteric reader of an allegorical city, seems close to his contemporary Jorge Luis Borges, fabulist of a rewritten universe. From a distance, Benjamin's magnificent opus is reminiscent of another great ruin of 20th- century literature, Ezra Pound's Cantos. Both works are built out of fragments, and adhere to the high-modernist aesthetics of image and montage. Both have economic ambitions and economists as presiding figures (Marx in one case, Gesell and Douglas in the other). Both authors have investments in antiquarian bodies of knowledge whose relevance to their own times they overestimate. Neither knows when to stop. And both were in the end consumed by the monster of fascism: Benjamin tragically, Pound shamefully. It has been the fate of the Cantos to have a handful of anthology pieces excerpted and the rest quietly dropped. The fate of the Arcades may well be similar. One can foresee a condensed student edition drawn mainly from convolutes B (Fashion), H (The Collector), I (The Interior), J (Baudelaire), K (Dream City), N (On the Theory of Knowledge) and Y (Photo- graphy), in which the quotations will be cut to a minimum and most of the surviving text will be by Benjamin himself. And that would not be a wholly bad thing. What was Walter Benjamin: a philosopher? A critic? A historian? A mere \"writer\"? The best answer is perhaps Hannah Arendt's: he was one of \"the unclassifiable ones... whose work neither fits the existing order nor introduces a new genre\". His trademark approach - coming at a subject not straight on but at an angle, moving stepwise from one perfectly formulated summation to the next - is as instantly recognisable as it is inimitable, depending on sharpness of intellect, learning lightly worn and a prose style which, once he had given up thinking of himself as Professor Benjamin, became a marvel of accuracy and concision. Underlying his project of getting at the truth of our times is an ideal he found expressed in Goethe: to set out the facts in such a way that the facts will be their own theory. The Arcades book, whatever our verdict on it - ruin, failure, impossible project - suggests a new way of writing about a civilisation using its rubbish as materials rather than its artworks: history from below rather than above. And his call elsewhere for a history centred on the sufferings of the vanquished, rather than on the achievements of the victors, is prophetic of the way in which history writing has begun to think of itself in our lifetime. \u0095 This is an edited extract from an article that first appeared in the New York Review of Books.

Mr Justice Eady dismissed an attempt by the attorney general, acting for MI6, to prevent extracts of Richard Tomlinson's book, The Big Breach: From Top Secret to Maximum Security, being published in tomorrow's Sunday Times. The book is being published in Moscow by Serge Korovin of the firm Narodny Variant (The Popular Option). The high court heard yesterday he intended to distribute 10,000 copies in Russia, the US and Germany. The judge said: \"The courts must be realistic, and avoid taking steps which run the risk of making the courts themselves look ridiculous in the global village of today.\" It was not for the courts to make gestures, he added. The Sunday Times told the court it should have the right to publish extracts once the book's contents had become \"generally accessible to the public at large\" anywhere in the world, either in print or on the internet. MI6 wanted a much stricter test, insisting British newspapers not publish until they could prove the contents had come to the \"widespread attention to the public at large\". Lawyers for MI6 said there was no evidence so far that the book had been distributed. The Russian publisher's website was announcing a press conference on Monday, the day after the Sunday Times wanted to publish exclusive extracts. Whitehall sources insisted the case was not a rerun of Spycatcher (the Thatcher government's attempt to suppress memoirs of the former MI5 officer Peter Wright), but MI6 lawyers last night appealed against the judge's ruling - it was unclear last night when this appeal would be heard.

It's a true life story of French bourgeois implosion - respectable doctor living near the Swiss border goes berserk, kills wife and two children, having previously shot his mother and father and attempted to strangle his mistress, sets fire to the family home and takes an overdose, only to be rescued, revived and charged with murder, much to the consternation of the local community, which had always regarded him as a solicitous, conscientious and caring husband, father and son. </p> <p>So far, so Chabrol. Then, with a twist worthy of Nabokov, a further level is revealed. In spite of everything he had claimed, the killer, Jean-Claude Romand, turns out never to have been a doctor at the World Health Organisation, nor to have any medical qualifications. The whole professional edifice of his life was an elaborate fabrication. This scandalous revelation was followed by local rumours of a romantic surrogate life in drug-running, and so on, but the truth was more desperate. </p> <p>Days when Romand had said he had been teaching in Dijon, or working at the WHO's Geneva headquarters, had been spent mooching about alone. Romand, the ostensibly successful professional and happy family man, had in fact done nothing with his life, except make it up. </p> <p>Herein, presumably, lies his appeal to Carr\u00e8re: a case of fiction intruding into reality, as well as that peculiar sense of wasted days and hanging around with which Carr\u00e8re, as a writer, could easily identify. It hardly seems worth pointing out that writers spend their lives making things up too. </p> <p>The perpetrator of all these lies was of course a mild man on the surface, in many ways unnoticeable, well used to avoiding drawing attention to himself, except occasionally, when he concocted elaborate ruses to both gain sympathy and distract - pretending while a student to have been set upon; claiming, when things got more desperate, that he had cancer. </p> <p>Romand's exceptional passivity and fear of confrontation seem to have been the products of a combination of geographical and family elements: rural isolation in a grandiose but oppressive landscape - the Jura forests of eastern France - in which he grew up a sensitive only child with a stoical, undemonstrative father and a sickly, fretting mother, on whom no demands could be made. Romand's neurosis manifested itself in an inability to take exams, and his initial break with his family - to study medicine instead of following his father into forestry management - faltered because of this. From that failure of nerve developed his forged life. </p> <p>What followed was a bizarre combination of upward mobility and stasis, funded initially by a parental allowance, then through embezzling the savings of relatives and friends. Here Romand was able to capitalise on two things: the traditional mistrust of the French paysan and petit bourgeois towards banks; and the proximity of the Swiss border. </p> <p>Romand was entrusted to make miraculous-sounding high-interest investments with this money, which was really used to fund an increasingly affluent middle-class lifestyle. Indeed, until the moment of implosion, Romand could be said to have lived an extreme version of the kind of compartmentalised life that countless middle-class men lead: the loving family man juggling with his hypocrisies, spending beyond his means, with a mistress on the side, a bit of porn at home, and fortnightly trips to the Only You Club massage parlour. </p> <p>After the trial, the shrinks would have a field day. So too would Romand, centre of attention at last, flattered by the (rather creepy) attendance of a famous author and having made the apparently effortless transition from being trapped in life's equivalent to a Chabrol or Fassbinder movie (Why Does Herr R Run Amok?) to the transcendentalism of one of Bresson's spiritual studies, in which the sinner achieves forgiveness and clarity. </p> <p>The major irony of Romand's life of lies was that what he secretly craved was exposure and testing, which were achieved with his trial. The complex psychological mechanisms of evasion and deferral produced in him a bizarre variation of a death wish. What he seemed to desire most was existence as a posthumous figure. This desire was realised - after his token suicide attempt following the murders - through the spectacle of trial as funeral, resulting in formal punishment and escape into religious serenity, with the help of Christian do-gooders. </p> <p> Given such great material, what is wrong with The Adversary? It asks too many rhetorical questions for a start, many of them the sort that sound better in, well, French. It also evokes too many superior fictions, including those authors and film-makers mentioned above, as well as Agnes Varda's Le Bonheur and the Swiss film Alpine Fire (family massacre in postcard landscape). Carr\u00e8re, to talk up his subject, probably makes more of a mystery of Romand than is deserved - the outcome of his wretched life seems both perfectly logical and transparent. </p> <p>What is really wanted is more speculation on the prosaic complicities and collusions that grew up around his fabrications - not simply with the author, who limits himself to a few \"mon semblable, mon fr\u00e8re\" riffs, but between Romand and his wife, who never called him at his office, and whom, one guesses, suspected but chose not to know. </p> <p>In translation, The Adversary too often reads like bad Primo Levi: a too slim, quasi-lucid (and quasi-bogus) philosophical and psychological inquiry into the nature of evil, verging on the lazy when it comes to the big imponderables and well summarised by its cop-out last sentence: \"I thought that writing this story could only be a crime or a prayer\"; to which the appropriate Anglo-Saxon retort is \"Pull the other one\". It also, given the singularity of its material, lacks narrative drive, and suffers from too much literal translation into duff English: \"How fragile life is! Only yesterday, there was a close, happy family, people who loved one another, and today - a boiler accident, charred bodies being taken to the morgue...\" Sacr\u00e9 bleu!</p>",

The lyrics of the former go like this: \"Life is great! So sing about it/ As we can and as we should,/ Shops and buses, towns and people,/ Village, farmland, field and wood.\" (It would appear that Mr Wren supposes shops, buses and towns capable of tuneful vocal utterance.) As Goodall says: \"I'm not on my own with this one, am I?\" No, he's not. </p> <p>It's not all easy stuff, which is good. I have always been perplexed about the difference between D flat and C sharp, with explanations about dominant cycles and the like causing the eyes to glaze over faster than a puddle in a cold snap; here Goodall does his best to explain the business of temperament, the Pythagorean comma, and why it took so long to invent the piano. I am not sure I have got all the details straight, and the eyes did glaze over a tiny bit, the brain reel in confusion - but this is my fault, not Goodall's. </p> <p>The strength and value of the book lie in the way it manages to approach music as a technical problem as well as a matter of mystery. (A chapter on how he composed his own \"Missa Aedis Christi\" shows, besides the fact that Goodall is not seriously plagued by a wish to avoid the limelight, that the creative process still has a core of inexplicability.)

Despite the comfortingly accidental hero, Wilf Wellingborough, its characters exude an air of confidence and accomplishment that might, had the novel been set in a later period, be termed the culture of entitlement. With an outward semblance of bumbling raffishness, they become publishers, magazine editors, gossip columnists, literary agents, and tycoons, without appearing to languish too long in the dreary doldrums of less glamorous occupations. </p> <p>These mysterious and irritating transformations are, to some extent, Fishwick's point. Against the backdrop of a decade of rapid expansion, cut-throat careerism and insubstantial stylishness, he deploys fast-buck reputations and apparently effortless success to create a well-oiled farce.

Despite the comfortingly accidental hero, Wilf Wellingborough, its characters exude an air of confidence and accomplishment that might, had the novel been set in a later period, be termed the culture of entitlement. With an outward semblance of bumbling raffishness, they become publishers, magazine editors, gossip columnists, literary agents, and tycoons, without appearing to languish too long in the dreary doldrums of less glamorous occupations. These mysterious and irritating transformations are, to some extent, Fishwick's point. Against the backdrop of a decade of rapid expansion, cut-throat careerism and insubstantial stylishness, he deploys fast-buck reputations and apparently effortless success to create a well-oiled farce. At its centre is Wilf, catapulted into the editorship of the small-circulation journal Arts Unlimited by childhood friend and aspiring press baron Jimmy Spalding, the on-the-make proprietor of a magazine empire who most resembles \"a whale chasing plankton\".

The historical setting is the English Civil War, and we absorb some of the radical ideas of the time from the servants' reading of contraband pamphlets that must be carefully concealed from their royalist masters. </p> <p>This is a mere undertone, however, to the two opening events that will drive the novel - Jacob's marriage to his beloved Caro, and the recent discovery of the gruesome murder of a young boy from a neighbouring household. These three constituents are the gunpowder that sets off a violent picaresque taking us through action with the New Model Army, a torridly erotic period of recovery in London and finally participation in an idealistic Diggers' commune before its brutal dissolution by the local lord of the manor. We end with that well-established device, the protagonist standing on the quay waiting for embarkation to the New World. </p> <p>McCann has opted for the intimacies of an internalizing, first-person style which must, in this case, shoulder the double burden of creating a convincing sense of historical period as well as character. The result avoids all the worst disasters that can befall such a project, but is by no means entirely free of genre-fiction blight. The sprinkling of \"liefs\", \"fains\" and even the occasional \"methinks\" often appears self-conscious. Period locutions set in the middle of an otherwise admirably plain and readable English can come across as translations from a less than fully mastered foreign language - when one of Jacob's brothers cannot understand something, he admits \"I cannot come at it\". At other times the target is missed in terms of tone - when the Diggers' colony becomes troublesome, Jacob looks back to a time \"when the colony was but a maggot in my friend's head\".' </p> <p>With respect to period detail we have a solid, if occasionally over-eager performance. Work has been done on domestic crafts, and this has resulted in details on the cleaning of pewter and the restoration of cloth which the real literature of the mid-17th century never found sufficiently interesting to mention. A command of military drill techniques is displayed, perhaps to excess. Most striking of all is the author's evident satisfaction in knowing the meaning of the words \"manchet\" and \"cheat\" (types of bread). These are used to the exclusion of the dreaded \"b\" word throughout the book, despite the fact that they were already antique in the mid-17th century and had caused the recent translators of the Bible no anxiety at all - \"And when they were eating, Jesus took b***d and blessed it . . .\" (only one of several scabrous references). No doubt the likes of us will appear in a novel 400 years hence routinely discussing multi-seeded organic bloomer. </p> <p>A graver difficulty is that to read As Meat Loves Salt is to spend 532 pages in the company of an unusually baffling psychopath. We know from the start that Jacob himself is responsible for the sadistic murder of young Christopher Walshe (Christopher had been cheeky to him). He has to flee justice on his wedding day, persuading his new wife in the space of a few lines to commit the capital offence of stealing her mistress's jewels and coming with him. Within hours he beats and rapes her. He has an intense desire to strangle a young boy he encounters in the New Model Army. He pulls a knife on the man who will become his lover in London, where he nearly succeeds in raping him too. He looks down on him after love-making and reflects how easy it would be to break his back. He betrays the Digger colony and passively observes its destruction while on the way back from having stolen its money. There is an assault, possibly murderous, on an infant that might be his. An inner voice tells him it his brother's child, and that seems to make it all right. Thence to Southampton and the New World - where, presumably, he adds the serial-killer gene to the population of the future United States. </p> <p>Clearly Jacob is not a well man, but the causes or indeed the aesthetic significance of his behaviour elude us. The justifying context of higher meaning that always surrounds the portrayal of violence in true art is absent here. The gestures at remorse are as fleeting and shallow as the interspersing episodes of violence. </p> <p>Perhaps because it contains more of Jacob's friend and subsequent lover Ferris, or perhaps because it contains a little more of the author herself, there is one set piece that is different. The siege and assault of the Catholic stronghold Basing House is distinctly the best thing in the book. The talent is obvious and for once, though it has to struggle to be heard through Jacob's mindless moral autism, there is compassion too.

In fact, this was a very serious and often deadly antagonism, with the British anxious to create a sympathetic buffer region that would protect their Indian holdings, and the Russians avid to expand their own lands into an empire. But the whole thrust of Tournament of Shadows is to demonstrate that so many others were eager for influence in the area over a much longer time-span than the 19th century that the Great Game may justifiably be regarded as \"a Victorian prologue to the Cold War\". </p> <p>Appropriately, the authors are Americans, Meyer a distinguished journalist with an historian's qualification (Princeton PhD), Brysac \"a prize-winning producer of prime-time documentaries for CBS... a contributing editor to Archaeology magazine\". And theirs is a very American (and slightly exhausting) approach to the writing of narrative history, including everything remotely relevant to their theme, in which no tidbit is left unturned. </p> <p>A great deal is familiar, of course, from many treatments on this side of the Atlantic, notably by Peter Hopkirk and John Keay. They start with William Moorcroft, the Lancashire horse doctor who was rescued from obscurity by Garry Alder's brilliant biography in 1985: he was probably the greatest of all the explorers in the region, primarily on the look-out for breeding stock that would improve the East India Company's stud, but also a meticulous observer of all that he encountered in then-unknown lands, which he relayed in copious despatches to his masters in Calcutta. In this sense, he was the first British spy, forerunner of dozens (some of the bravest and best were Indians) who endured great hardship and danger in order to secure alliances with local chieftains, lend an ear to useful gossip in the bazaar, map the ground and, increasingly, keep an eye open for signs of Russian influence. </p> <p>We have long known, too, all that can be valuably said about two soldiers, Charles Stoddart and Arthur Conolly (who coined the phrase \"the Great Game\"), who were executed by the Emir of Bokhara for noseying around his realm. And about Capt Montgomerie, Royal Engineers, and his Indian pundits, who disguised themselves as pilgrims and logged the miles they trod on their prayer wheels. Also those who pulled strings in Calcutta, like Charles Metcalfe, who was Moorcroft's boss, and Lord Curzon, who is treated more generously than usual here, being seen (quite rightly) as something more than an arrogant imperialist. The traditional adversaries of these Brits are in turn carefully reviewed: Capt Vitkevitch, whose \"life history was Dostoyevskian\", first of the Czar's men to head for Afghanistan; Nikolai Przhevalsky, the Russophile Pole who discovered a new breed of horse on one of his four expeditions into Central Asia, all fired by his huge contempt for its inhabitants. There are several others. </p> <p>The real value of Tournament of Shadows for anyone who already knows about these participants comes in the last third of the book, where Meyer and Brysac turn to the also-rans in this territorial competition. And here the atmosphere of the main text (not the source notes) becomes heavy with disclosure, with some information \"scarcely known even now to specialists\", other revelations made possible \"thanks to the opening of long-closed archives\", and something hitherto buried in \"a revealing Yale doctoral dissertation by the Canadian scholar David Schimmelpenninck van der Oye\": I don't think this is a leg-pull. </p> <p>The authors have thus thrown into relief William Woodville Rockhill, \"the original China Hand\", formerly of the French Foreign Legion, friend of Sara Chandra Das, the first pundit, and Theodore Roosevelt's envoy in Peking, great scholar and extensive traveller in the region, who left 6,000 volumes of Orientalia to the Library of Congress and \"initiated a century of American emotional and political involvement with Tibet\": and here's a photograph, in which he looks uncommonly like Sir Henry Irving playing Macbeth. Another illustration pictures what could be a Flying Fortress pilot on a mule, who is Captain Brooke Dolan II, explorer and socialite in uniform, who embarked on a secret mission to Lhasa in 1942, which ultimately led to the CIA training Tibetan guerrillas in Colorado before sending them into China in 40 air drops, which only a quarter of them survived. </p> <p>Dolan may also have been the dupe of the Nazi SS, the sponsor of an expedition to Tibet ordered by Heinrich Himmler in 1939, which resulted in a cordial dinner party of Germans and local nobles, with a swastika and SS flashes hanging in pennants on the wall. The American had befriended the expedition's leader, Ernst Sch\u00e4fer, and may have contributed several thousand dollars to his funds. Much, much worse was the involvement of the odious Sven Hedin, an extraordinary mapmaker in Central Asia and an unrepentant racist wherever he went, whose admiration for Hitler was rewarded when the Swede was invited to make the opening speech at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. </p> <p>It is possible to nitpick at certain things in this book: at the occasional lapse into Time -speak (\"With his cascading sable beard, glowering brow, and strong Roman nose...\"), at the urge to update instantly the remoter facts of history (the murder of Sir John Macnaghten at Kabul in 1841 is pursued by a parenthetic reminder that \"the scene was repeated in 1997, when Taliban militants seized and executed Najibullah...\"), and one or two errors of understanding (the authors are a bit muddled about the theory of Indo-European languages), but this is a scrupulously balanced and extremely readable chronicle of a very top-heavy subject. It is a book about cartography, archaeology, anthropology and several other things, as well as exploration and imperial lust. It is overview with nobs on. Whoever would have thought that Virginia Woolf could have had even a walk-on part in an account of the Great Game? Or Steven Spielberg?</p>",

It is possible to nitpick at certain things in this book: at the occasional lapse into Time -speak (\"With his cascading sable beard, glowering brow, and strong Roman nose...\"), at the urge to update instantly the remoter facts of history (the murder of Sir John Macnaghten at Kabul in 1841 is pursued by a parenthetic reminder that \"the scene was repeated in 1997, when Taliban militants seized and executed Najibullah...\"), and one or two errors of understanding (the authors are a bit muddled about the theory of Indo-European languages), but this is a scrupulously balanced and extremely readable chronicle of a very top-heavy subject. It is a book about cartography, archaeology, anthropology and several other things, as well as exploration and imperial lust. It is overview with nobs on. Whoever would have thought that Virginia Woolf could have had even a walk-on part in an account of the Great Game? Or Steven Spielberg?",

Republicanism was a gathering storm at a time when the monarchy seemed an expensive irrelevance to the questions of the day. Yet by the time of Victoria's death, on January 22, 1901, the editors of the Dictionary of National Biography felt they had to extend the remit of their work past the end of the 19th century to include her entry, so completely did she embody national life. </p> <p>Part of the reason is mere longevity: Victoria enjoyed the longest reign in the history of the monarchy, a period which coincided with an unparalleled growth in national wealth and Britain's leap to world dominance. The other reason, paradoxically, was death: Albert had done the British monarchy a favour by dying young, both removing himself, a minor German prince, from interference in the public scene, and stimulating Victoria's extended period of mourning, which kept her from excessive meddling while sharper minds applied themselves to the business of Britain. </p> <p>By the time she returned to effective public life, the turbulent years of mass riot and discontent on the mainland were past. Disraeli's 1867 Reform Act had made Britain something very close to a democracy, and the nation was enjoying a better distribution of its prosperity than ever before. The monarchy could still be described (and sometimes was) as an expensive irrelevance, but in Victoria's last 30 years the institution that had been a focus for growing discontent was representative of the nation's lush self-satisfaction. Victoria's own death resonated through the lives of her subjects, most of whom had known no other monarch. </p> <p>The rituals of death, graves and mourning had also developed into very Victorian ceremonies, with expressions of social position found in coffin plates and handles, mourning cards, black-edged envelopes, fans of black silk and ebony, horses with plumes, mutes, men with batons and wands, and yards and yards of black crepe. It was as though, by dying, the Widow of Windsor, so long associated with the sepulchral, had truly come into her estate. </p> <p>Victoria herself had ordered the dead Prince Albert's clothes to be laid out for him every day with a basin of hot water and a towel, leaving his rooms and possessions as they were at his death, even having his chamber pot scoured daily. This did not, however, set a trend, as James Stevens Curl explains in his expanded and reissued classic The Victorian Celebration of Death. Everyone engaged to some extent in funerary rituals, but \"the Queen's response to death was perceived by many of her subjects to be unhealthy, faintly absurd, and distasteful\". </p> <p>It was her name rather than her attitudes that characterised her age. Victoria was not much of a Victorian, with her mistrust of the church and distaste for earnestness in general. Even her favourite bishop, Mandell Creighton, who is now exhaustively celebrated in A Victorian Marriage: Mandell and Louise Creighton, found her a strain. He confided to his diary, \"Dined with the Queen. It was not so awful as I had expected\", while his clever, preachy wife was not welcome, with what Victoria sneered at as her \"exceedingly strong opinions\". </p> <p>Victoria's demise should have been long anticipated and planned for, but as two books on the days surrounding the event emphasise, her death was so unthinkable that the court and government were in a farcical state of unpreparedness. Last Days of Glory and the factually superior Farewell in Splendour have little new to say, but do give a salutary picture of Victoria, for the first time in her servants' memory not getting up to face the world, curled up in a foetal position looking towards the hand-tinted photo of Albert that hung by her bed. The empress who ruled nearly a quarter of humanity had long been an icon; now she was just a sick person. </p> <p>One of the few absolute obligations for a monarch is the production of an adequate heir, but the Queen and her consort had utterly failed to fit the Prince of Wales for the job for which he was destined. Too fun-loving to be a natural royal, he had earned his parents' lasting displeasure when they discovered he was having an affair with an actress while he was on military training. Both Victoria and Albert badly over-reacted, seeing a mere love affair as evidence of their son's unsuitability for the throne. In a funereal masque of the Oedipus myth, when Albert died soon after (probably from typhoid caused by the unsanitary drainage in Windsor Castle), Victoria blamed the stress caused by the Prince of Wales's dalliance and resented her son throughout her long black-clad widowhood. Unfortunately for the nation, she took his sexually active nature as evidence of his inaptitude for statecraft, and insisted that her ministers deny him any opportunity of training for the job for which he was destined. When she was over 80, Victoria expressed a wish to continue living, the only objective (given her belief in the afterlife and certainty she would see her beloved Albert again) being to deny her son the throne. </p> <p>Thwarted in this, when she finally died in the arms of her doctor and her grandson the Kaiser, all eyes turned to poor old Tum Tum, he of the 59 years and the 48-inch waistline, who had never done much in his life but eat, drink and have sex: \"Edward the Caresser\", as Henry James called him. He was better suited to be a cigar brand than a monarch. </p> <p>On becoming king, literally his first action was to give a speech saying he would not be ruling under his own name of Albert but would be called Edward. He explained he wanted to leave his father's name as the \"exclusive treasure\" of his mother. In fact, he wanted nothing at all to do with a name of which he had been told throughout his entire life he was not worthy. The queen was dead. Long live the fun.</p>",

Victoria herself had ordered the dead Prince Albert's clothes to be laid out for him every day with a basin of hot water and a towel, leaving his rooms and possessions as they were at his death, even having his chamber pot scoured daily. This did not, however, set a trend, as James Stevens Curl explains in his expanded and reissued classic The Victorian Celebration of Death. Everyone engaged to some extent in funerary rituals, but \"the Queen's response to death was perceived by many of her subjects to be unhealthy, faintly absurd, and distasteful\". It was her name rather than her attitudes that characterised her age. Victoria was not much of a Victorian, with her mistrust of the church and distaste for earnestness in general. Even her favourite bishop, Mandell Creighton, who is now exhaustively celebrated in A Victorian Marriage: Mandell and Louise Creighton, found her a strain. He confided to his diary, \"Dined with the Queen. It was not so awful as I had expected\", while his clever, preachy wife was not welcome, with what Victoria sneered at as her \"exceedingly strong opinions\". Victoria's demise should have been long anticipated and planned for, but as two books on the days surrounding the event emphasise, her death was so unthinkable that the court and government were in a farcical state of unpreparedness. Last Days of Glory and the factually superior Farewell in Splendour have little new to say, but do give a salutary picture of Victoria, for the first time in her servants' memory not getting up to face the world, curled up in a foetal position looking towards the hand-tinted photo of Albert that hung by her bed. The empress who ruled nearly a quarter of humanity had long been an icon; now she was just a sick person. One of the few absolute obligations for a monarch is the production of an adequate heir, but the Queen and her consort had utterly failed to fit the Prince of Wales for the job for which he was destined. Too fun-loving to be a natural royal, he had earned his parents' lasting displeasure when they discovered he was having an affair with an actress while he was on military training. Both Victoria and Albert badly over-reacted, seeing a mere love affair as evidence of their son's unsuitability for the throne. In a funereal masque of the Oedipus myth, when Albert died soon after (probably from typhoid caused by the unsanitary drainage in Windsor Castle), Victoria blamed the stress caused by the Prince of Wales's dalliance and resented her son throughout her long black-clad widowhood. Unfortunately for the nation, she took his sexually active nature as evidence of his inaptitude for statecraft, and insisted that her ministers deny him any opportunity of training for the job for which he was destined. When she was over 80, Victoria expressed a wish to continue living, the only objective (given her belief in the afterlife and certainty she would see her beloved Albert again) being to deny her son the throne. Thwarted in this, when she finally died in the arms of her doctor and her grandson the Kaiser, all eyes turned to poor old Tum Tum, he of the 59 years and the 48-inch waistline, who had never done much in his life but eat, drink and have sex: \"Edward the Caresser\", as Henry James called him. He was better suited to be a cigar brand than a monarch. On becoming king, literally his first action was to give a speech saying he would not be ruling under his own name of Albert but would be called Edward. He explained he wanted to leave his father's name as the \"exclusive treasure\" of his mother. In fact, he wanted nothing at all to do with a name of which he had been told throughout his entire life he was not worthy. The queen was dead. Long live the fun.",

But it takes a brave human to realise this. Stephen Budiansky is only intermittently brave. The first chapter of his book, The Truth about Dogs, lays out very clearly the case that dogs are, biologically speaking, parasites on humanity, degenerate wolves who lost 25 per cent of their brain mass after they discovered it was easier to scavenge around primitive man than to hunt for a living. The rest of it argues what lovable, friendly, and rewarding parasites they are.

He is also the author of How Animals Think, whose subtitle should have been \"Not at all\".

He has explained how we have been able to domesticate horses by subverting their instincts for herd life - and even, to some extent, to domesticate dogs by appealing to their social instincts. But the inescapable conclusion is that dogs have been much more successful at subverting our instincts to their purposes than the other way round. Unhappy and lonely people find that dogs are what humans should have been. When the scientist points out that dogs are only what dogs should have been, they can expect attacks. </p> <p>A few hard statistics show the extent to which dogs have benefited from us. The dogs of America produce two million tons of turds every year; they eat, for their body weight, twice as much as American humans. Think of the size of the average American human being, and you will realise what a tribute this is. What is really revealing, though, is that while Americans spend $5bn a year on dog food, they spend nearly half as much again on dog medicine. </p> <p>This cannot possibly be justified on grounds of utility. When you look at the genetics, it turns out that dogs were parasites long before they were ever useful. According to DNA evidence, dogs diverged from wolves 100,000 years before there was anything useful for them to do for human beings - before we had animals to herd, or property to defend. As Budiansky points out: \"No one has done an actual study of this, but there is every reason to be very suspicious of even the most common rationalisation of dogs' utility to man, as guardians of property or intruder alarms; for every tale of a dog successfully frightening off burglars, there are thousands of dogs who bark incessantly at every goddamned thing that moves and then sleep blissfully through a crime in progress.\" </p> <p>There speaks the true voice of exasperated love, and in it you hear the final triumph of the dog. For, as various devoted students of dogs have discovered, the idea of loving them is very new and very western. Most of the dogs of Africa survive by being despised. They are too filthy to touch or to attack. Wolves, which are clean and beautiful, have been hunted almost to extinction because they are seen as dangerous. Dogs have survived and prospered because they are seen as disgusting. The first adaptation that seems to have been made by the proto-dog to human society was to lose its predatory instincts towards non-dogs and to replace them with aggression. </p> <p>The difference is important: the predator wants to kill you as unobtrusively as possible; the aggressor wants to bully you as visibly as possible. Dogs, in their triumph over humans, so well described by Budiansky, have shown that aggression pays better than predation in this world. It's a striking example of the explanatory power of modern biology - but of course dogs understand this quite instinctively.

Under the cover of his sometimes astonishingly prescient scientific speculation, he has brought us fables of imagined futuristic worlds where, at the story's close, we are shown that \"the former things are passed away\". As his Collected Stories helps to demonstrate, there has been no popular writer since the days of C S Lewis and Charles Williams whose disposition is more nakedly apocalyptic, who takes greater pleasure in cradling eternity in the palm of his hand. </p> <p>At its ambitious best, Clarke's grave and lucidly written fiction vaults metaphysically across millennia and contracts the near-infinite arc of astronomical time. It gives us not the usual picturesque bric-a-brac of sci-fi - the invading aliens, dogfighting spaceships and feuding interstellar empires - but the long, immortalising perspective within which humanity's brief lifespan looks either newly irrelevant, or newly purposeful and complete. All his finest books share the same, dwarfing John Martin-ish visual perspective, the sense of tiny human figures suspended against visionary galactic immensities, transfigured at the supreme moment by the ages and the stars. Again and again, in Against the Fall of Night or 2001: A Space Odyssey or the Rendezvous with Rama novels or his last-days-of-the-human race classic Childhood's End, we seem to hear in our heads, as we read the final pages, the age-old biblical testimony: \"And I saw a new heaven and new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away.\" </p> <p>To describe Clarke as a mystical fabulist may sound perverse when there is so much in his work that appears hostile to the religious view, or at least unsentimentally agnostic. But beneath its progressive science, its apparent faith in the rational calm of the technological mind, his writing has always been disturbed by that ancient, bedevilling sorcerer's itch: the hunger for mysticism and metamorphosis. Long before magic realism, Clarke's science fiction found ways to make the outwardly miraculous an expression of an inner emotional need without violating the literal, technical integrity of the accepted external world. </p> <p>In a factual essay, \"The Obsolescence of Man\", written in the early 1960s, Clarke had speculated: \"Although intelligence can only arise from life, it may then discard it. Perhaps, as the mystics have suggested, it may also discard matter...\" Essentially, this evolutionary sea-change, its imminence and dreadful beauty, became the theme of all his mature novels. Something of the precocious child, eager but unhappy in the world, still clings to his fiction. It's as if, from the start, the rooted intractability of human affairs distressed him, and he turned instead to a new dispensation, far in the future, when the tarnished experiment of \"civilisation\" - with all its congen ital warfare and wearying psychic division - is approaching its end, about to make the quantum jump to a realm of pure intelligence, something closer to the Buddhist ideal of integrated spiritual creation that I suspect Clarke at least half-believes. </p> <p>\"It might seem a risky notion to drive sci-fi into magic,\" wrote Penelope Gilliatt in the New Yorker in the spring of 1968, when the film of 2001: A Space Odyssey was first released, before concluding, in a shrewdly far-sighted review (which is quoted in full by Piers Bizony in his judicious and well-informed account of the film's production, 2001: Filming the Future ), that director Stanley Kubrick and Clarke had nevertheless \"made it the poetically just place to go\". Probably, at the same time, a shade too much of the conceptual credit for the film's half-luminous, half-baffling structure went to Kubrick, too little to Clarke, who had in fact selectively plundered a number of his earlier works in order to bring to the screenplay a narrative and philosophical audacity unheard of in mainstream commercial cinema. </p> <p>As those early, appreciatively tuned-in college-student audiences instinctively understood, the film's shape was poetic and metaphorical, not straightforwardly dramatic. The transition from the shrieking, war-hungry man-apes brandishing their bone-clubs, agog at the sense of infinite possibility that strategic murder creates for their species, to the effortless technological super-sophistication of a half-empty Pan-Am space cruiser, waltzing the heavens with insolent imperial grace, gave us, in a single provocative jump-cut, a taste of Clarke and Kubrick's scepticism and restlessness. It demonstrated their fascination with the umbilical cord connecting the barbarous past and the far-seeking, ambitious future, their urge to make their audiences think philosophically. </p> <p>It's interesting to see how the seeds of virtually all his major novels are scattered across Clarke's Collected Stories , in tightly wrought tales of serendipity or suspense that, while they contain seductive pre-echoes of the metaphysical breadth Clarke would achieve in the longer form, reveal him also as a twist-in-the-tail, punchline-addicted contributor to sci-fi periodicals such as Thrilling Wonder Stories and Science-Fantasy. The central ideas of 2001 originate in a series of small-scale but ingeniously plotted anecdotes of discovery or confrontation - the alien pyramid, unearthed from the lunar surface, signalling to its maker the news of the human race's first giant leap beyond the earth in \"The Sentinel\"; the visiting star-voyager benignly steering prehistoric man towards the uses of technology in \"Encounter at Dawn\".

They throng with memorable images, situations that have the power to cast their own disconcertingly long emotional shadow into the reader's mind. The least of them are mere clever doodles, playful but Roald Dahl-ishly glib. The best are like fairytales - wise, light-hearted but emotionally compelling, calmly luminous in their descriptions of terrible or miraculous events vivid with a sense of sadness and loss, and, like all profound stories of magic, essentially improbable, essentially convincing.</p>",

They throng with memorable images, situations that have the power to cast their own disconcertingly long emotional shadow into the reader's mind. The least of them are mere clever doodles, playful but Roald Dahl-ishly glib. The best are like fairytales - wise, light-hearted but emotionally compelling, calmly luminous in their descriptions of terrible or miraculous events vivid with a sense of sadness and loss, and, like all profound stories of magic, essentially improbable, essentially convincing.",

      "body": "<p>When George W Bush is sworn in as US president today, Washington will be braced for the biggest inaugural-day demonstrations since Vietnam war protesters dogged Richard Nixon in 1973. The call to the streets is backed by a key veteran of that anti-war movement, Noam Chomsky. Yet America's number one dissident is neither surprised nor disappointed by this election. </p> <p>\"It was a triumph of US democracy,\" he says, with terse irony that can be mistaken for cynicism. \"Issues on which the business world is united don't arise in elections, so people vote on peripheral issues the media concentrate on: personality, style - will George Bush remember where Canada is? That's how to maintain power when you can't control people by force. That's exactly the way the Madisonian system is supposed to work.\" </p> <p>Chomsky, now 72, has spent much of his life stripping away America's most cherished illusions. Attacking a political system of \"four-year dictatorship\" and an intelligentsia servile to power, he sees not a free press, but the paradox of \"brainwashing under freedom\". A perennial scourge of US foreign policy, from its Latin American \"backyard\" to Israel and Indonesia, he tilts at America's \"flattering self-image\" of benevolent intent. Domestic liberties in the world's freest society coexist, he insists, with an imperial dynamic that, in making the world safe for US capital, leaves the blood of atrocities on American hands. </p> <p>Edward Said, professor of comparative literature at Columbia University, sees Chomsky's work as a \"protracted war between fact and a series of myths\". For him: \"Noam is one of the most significant challengers of unjust power and delusions; he goes against every assumption about American altruism and humanitarianism.\" Another friend, the journalist John Pilger, agrees Chomsky's enduring theme is power, \"that unaccountable power must always be scrutinised and never accepted at face value. He strips away layers of propaganda not recognised as propaganda, brilliantly sifting through political discourse. Often, he goes to the public record, revealing truth in the words of power itself.\" </p> <p>Chomsky's latest book, A New Generation Draws The Line, is out next month. Its title echoes Tony Blair's words on the 1999 Kosovo war. For Chomsky, the \"official doctrine\" of the dawn of a brave new era of military intervention to safeguard human rights is as much a sham as the \"New World Order\" trumpeted during the Gulf war. Contrasting the avowed concern for Kosovo with indifference to Kurds in Nato's ally Turkey, or with US fuelling of atrocities in Colombia and (with its British sidekick) East Timor, he denies that the inconsistency can be benign. On Kosovo, Chomsky adds, since the worst Serb atrocities predictably followed the Nato air strikes they were said to justify, protecting human rights was neither a motive nor an outcome. </p> <p>Chomsky first made his name in linguistic philosophy, where the \"Chomskian revolution\" in studying language as a faculty of the mind/brain was pivotal in the radical shift in cognitive science of the 50s and 60s; the era before him was known as \"Linguistics BC\". While he has modified his linguistic theory over the years - the latest being the Minimalist Programme outlined last autumn in his book New Horizons In The Study Of Language And Mind - his impact on the field has been likened to that of Einstein or Freud. He has broached barriers between the sciences and humanities. \"He did for cognitive science what Galileo did for physical science,\" says Neil Smith, professor of linguistics at University College, London. \"We now study the mind as part of the physical world.\" </p> <p>Chomsky ranks with Marx, Shakespeare and the Bible as one of the 10 most quoted sources in the humanities - and is the only writer among them still alive. Even one of his staunchest critics, the philosopher Hilary Putnam, acknowledged that reading Chomsky was to be \"struck by a sense of great intellectual power; one knows one is encountering an extraordinary mind\", whose virtues included \"originality and scorn for the faddish and superficial\". His dual prowess, in linguistics and politics, and some 70 books, have fuelled suspicions that there must be two Chomskys. Yet their relationship remains an enigma. When the New York Times called him \"arguably the most important intellectual alive today\", the writer continued: \"[So] how can he write such terrible things about American foreign policy?\" </p> <p>His view of academics and journalists as \"secular priests\" has scarcely endeared him to the US media , yet his frequent talks in the US and abroad are guaranteed audiences in their thousands. His speeches and interviews, including transcriptions from local radio, cram the internet. </p> <p>He is institute professor of linguistics and philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, across the Charles river from Boston. His once wiry frame now appears fuller (though he remains a keen swimmer), and his soft, gravelly voice belies his reputation for fierce rows. Seriousness gives way to radiant anticipation of a weekend visit from his daughter Diane, who works for development agencies with her Nicaraguan husband in Managua, and and their two children, Ema and Inti. (Chomsky and his wife Carol have another daughter, Avi, who teaches Latin American history, and a son, Harry, a softwear engineer in California.) </p> <p>Chomsky has described himself as a \"fanatic\" in terms of workload and a \"neurotic letter writer\". According to Morris Halle, a colleague and friend for more than 40 years, \"when you send him five pages of criticism, he sends 10 pages back, whoever you are. It's not ego, it's the substance of the criticism that's the issue.\" Two assistants help cope with the 200-odd emails he receives each day. While many friends stress Chomsky's work ethic, phenomenal memory, ironic sense of humour and self-effacement, Halle says he is \"not much for small talk; everything he does he takes seriously - with real commitment\". </p> <p>Chomsky was born in 1928 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the eldest of two boys. His father William, a Hebrew scholar, had fled Russia in 1913 to avoid being drafted into the Tsarist army. His mother Elsie, who came as an infant from Lithuania, also taught in Hebrew school. \"My immediate family was kind of a Jewish ghetto in Philadelphia,\" says Chomsky. \"My father's family was extremely orthodox, from an east European shtetl.\" His mother's relatives, who included communists, were \"unemployed and involved in a rich, vibrant intellectual life - ranging from music and art to political activity. Most had little formal education, but it was a lively working-class culture that happened to be Jewish.\" One uncle in New York, \"a hunchback with a background in crime\", ran a newsstand on the corner of 72nd Street and Broadway. </p> <p>Chomsky was a child of the Great Depression of 1929-39. \"By the standards of those days we were well off; both my parents had jobs.\" Among his earliest memories were \"seeing people coming to the door selling rags; and in a trolley car with my mother, I saw people beating up women strikers outside a textile factory\". He came early to political consciousness. \"I always felt isolated in my picture of the world. This was the late 30s; a time of political activism, debate, and great fear of Hitler conquering Europe. I saw the world as a complicated, frightening place.\" </p> <p>Survival was tough for \"the only Jewish family in a lower-middle-class neighbourhood that was mostly Irish and German Catholic, and rabidly anti-Semitic. The local kids went to Jesuit school, and I grew up with a visceral fear of Catholics. There were pro-Nazi beer parties at the fall of Paris. Then in December 1941 [after the Japanese attacked the US fleet at Pearl Harbor] the neighbourhood shifted 180 degrees. The same people who were cheering for the Nazis would open their doors wearing tin hats to say, 'pull down the blinds'. It was an educational experience.\" He adds: \"Neither my brother nor I talked to my parents about this. They were in the Jewish ghetto and we were partly out in the streets. But it wasn't the kind of thing you talked about.\" </p> <p>On the origins of his acute sense of moral responsibility, Chomsky is tentative: \"I was very moved as a young child by oppression, destruction, the intense fear of what was going on in Europe. I'd hear Hitler's speeches on the radio and see the reactions of my mother. By the time I was nine or 10 I was reading newspapers, and it went on from there. It seems obvious: you're responsible for your own actions, and their anticipated consequences.\" He was 16 when the US dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. \"I was in a Hebrew-speaking summer camp when news came. I found it shocking, and equally shocking to me was that nobody seemed to care. There was nobody to talk to because no-one saw it as an atrocity.\" While his progressive primary school had put a \"premium on individual creativity\", he found his high school - where he excelled - dullingly competitive. </p> <p>Chomsky sees the debate among immigrants as his political education. A lifelong anarchist or \"libertarian socialist\" - not a doctrine but a \"tendency in human thought\" - he believes \"violence, deceit and lawlessness are natural functions of the state\". At 10 he wrote an editorial for his school newspaper on the fall of Barcelona in the Spanish civil war, a \"lament about the rise of fascism\". \"I was always on the side of the losers,\" he said. He recalls: \"I spent my free time from age 13 picking up anarchist books in stores. I was quickly attracted to left anarchist critiques of the Bolsheviks, and [became] interested in the Spanish anarchist revolution which was crushed by communists.\" </p> <p>He was active in a \"fringe of Zionism\" - \"always opposed to a Jewish state, and in favour of a bi-nationalist outcome in Palestine based on Arab-Jewish co-operation, which wasn't so unrealistic at the time as it seems today\". In 1953 he spent six weeks on an Israeli kibbutz with his wife, Carol Schatz (now a linguist), whom he had known at Hebrew school and married in 1949. \"We seriously thought of moving there; I liked the life. The nice thing about physical labour is you have a finite task - when it's done, it's done. No one's going to second-guess you.\" But there were flaws in what Chomsky saw as an anarchist experiment. \"The way the Arabs, and even Oriental Jews, were treated was very ugly. The thing that disturbed me most was the ideological uniformity; it was deeply Stalinist - left and Buberite - which I found impossible to take.\" </p> <p>Drawn into linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania, where he worked under the libertarian Zellig Harris (and paid his way as a Hebrew schoolteacher), Chomsky became a junior fellow at Harvard. He moved down the road to MIT in 1955. \"Jews were barely tolerated in Harvard; they weren't part of the cultural life. One reason MIT became so great was that Jewish intellectuals couldn't get jobs elsewhere.\" He felt an outsider in other ways. \"I had no professional credentials. I got my position here in a research laboratory on electronics, of which I know nothing. But it happened to be the centre of innovative research and had no vested interests in the humanities. They were willing to experiment.\" </p> <p>His Syntactic Structures, published in 1957 when he was 29, revolutionised the study of language as part of psychology and biology. From his belief that, despite the Babel of tongues, humans share an innate language faculty, or \"organ\", grew his theory of an underlying Universal Grammar. New disciplines, from psycholinguistics to how children learn language, sprang from his ideas. According to Jean Aitchison, professor of language and communication at Oxford: \"In less than 120 pages, he turned linguistics from an obscure discipline, studied by missionaries, into a major social science. He shifted the question from the corpus of actual utterance to the mental system that produces it.\" </p> <p> Heir to Enlightenment ideas of language as a \"mirror of the mind\", Chomsky shares the Cartesian view that language is the human inheritance that most distinguishes man from animal or machine. (A chimpanzee whom researchers in the 1970s tried unsuccessfully to teach sign language was roguishly named Nim Chimpsky.) His work is still disparaged in some quarters as unscientific \"MIT mentalism\". Yet according to Steven Pinker, professor of psychology at MIT and author of The Language Instinct, Chomsky's \"theory of generative grammar is the most common single approach to linguistics even today. It's a minority view, but everyone sets their sights on it: it's the theory to beat.\" </p> <p>Chomsky's scathing 1959 review of BF Skinner, for whom language was merely learnt behaviour, bucked the empiricist tenet of the blank slate - that there is nothing in the mind that was not first in the senses. \"He gave the first, fatal shot to the school of behaviourism, and made theories of innate mental structure respectable after centuries of their being unthinkable,\" says Pinker, who hints at one link between theories of language and politics: \"Skinner said behaviour should be controlled; he wanted to turn society into a Skinner box - rewarding and punishing humans like the rats and pigeons in his experiments, a vision Chomsky described as like a \"well-run concentration camp\". </p> <p>Chomsky has tended to shy away from explicitly linking his linguistic and political theories. Others, though, link his insistence on universality - that everybody speaks \"human\" - and the creativity evidenced by language to his anarchist vision of free association. Political systems often rest on a view of human nature, and in his 1970 essay Language And Freedom, Chomsky wrote of language as a \"springboard\" for investigating that nature. \"Linkages were drawn in the 17th and 18th centuries between language as a fundamental, creative component of intelligence, and an instinct for freedom that could be the basis of how humans organise their lives,\" he says. \"I think there is something to it, though there's certainly no logical connection. </p> <p>\"But it's an interesting question as to why behaviourism had the appeal and prestige it did when it's so barren and shallow. Within the Marxist left - not including Marx - there's a strong tendency to insist there is no human nature; that people are just constructed by their historical circumstances and environment. This makes no sense, but these ideas are very convenient for those who aspire to managerial politics; they remove moral barriers to manipulation and coercion. </p> <p>\"If people have no fundamental human nature based on some instinct for freedom that can challenge and overthrow aggression and hierarchy, then there really are no moral values; if people are ignorant, malleable creatures who can be modified by experience and training, they can be controlled for their own good. That's an appealing idea to intellectuals across the political spectrum. Leninism is one expression of it, and social democracy is another.\" </p> <p>By 1961, Chomsky was a full professor at MIT, happy in his research, and with a young family. In 1964, supporting students against the draft, he began openly resisting the Vietnam war (\"it would have been hopelessly immoral not to\"). He rues it was \"already much too late; after the US invaded South Vietnam, what we call ethnic cleansing when others are doing it was going on from the early 60s. That was the time to get seriously involved.\" He knew there was no going back. \"It was a tremendous burden for my wife. She went back to college and got a degree partly because it looked as though I might go to jail.\" </p> <p>For years, he recalls, \"it was almost impossible to act publicly against the war. In Boston, a liberal city which likes to call itself the Athens of America, I spoke at the first major public meeting, in October 1965. We were attacked by hordes of people, and were only saved by the state police: they didn't like what we were saying but didn't want people murdered on Boston Common.\" He became a tax resister in 1966 and was arrested at the 1967 Pentagon protest. Norman Mailer, who was jailed with him, recalled a \"slim, sharp- featured man with an ascetic expression and an air of gentle but absolute moral authority\" - who seemed \"uneasy at the thought of missing class on Monday\". </p> <p>In his 1966 essay The Responsibility Of Intellectuals, Chomsky described their duty as being \"to speak the truth and to expose lies\". His first collection of political writings, American Power and the New Mandarins, was published in 1969. While intellectuals and \"commissars\" lie in the service of power, he suggests, it requires no expertise other than \"Cartesian common sense\" to understand politics or foreign affairs. Some critics have objected to an opposition between indoctrinated \"elites\" and \"the people\". He responds: \"In any inegalitarian society, there's a natural tendency for those who share wealth and power to try to maintain it. Some systems do it by force; others by gaining the consent of the population, or at least their passivity.\" </p> <p>In Manufacturing Consent, co-authored with Edward Herman, Chomsky proposed a model of the mass media that moulds this consent with bias and omission. \"Propaganda is to democracy what violence is to totalitarianism,\" they wrote. While some see the \"propaganda model\" as reducing everyone to dupes or liars, others have dismissed it as conspiracy theory. \"It's exactly the opposite - it's free-market theory,\" says Chomsky. \"The media are major corporations. They sell a product (readers or viewers) to a market (advertisers). If a Martian were looking at this system, what would he expect? That the media product would be shaped by the perspectives and interests of the sellers and buyers and the external conditions (the state). You'd expect no interaction at all. It's no more a conspiracy than that General Motors tries to make a profit.\" </p> <p>The internet is a means of evading media limitations, he believes, citing protests, such as those in Seattle, which were heavily reliant on net organisation. But he sees a struggle being waged, since net development was handed to private corporations in the mid-90s, between its use as an \"information superhighway\"and as a channel for \"ecommerce\". He says: \"As long as it was in the public sector it was free and open but limited; few people had access. Now access is wider, but the freedom is under attack.\" </p> <p>In Deterring Democracy, and other books on international affairs, Chomsky has copiously documented how Washington thwarts democratic experiments across the globe. Though his focus is increasingly on economic and trade issues, he continues to hold the US to account as a \"rogue superpower\" which distinguishes between \"worthy\" and \"unworthy\" victims of atrocity depending on whether they take place in a client state or in an \"official enemy\". He claims that if the Nuremberg laws had been applied then every post-war American president would have been hanged. </p> <p>He was accused of playing down Khmer Rouge atrocities in Cambodia, but maintains he was merely telling the truth about the number of deaths. \"We also pointed out that casualties of American bombing had been greatly exaggerated, but no one criticised us for correcting that.\" </p> <p>Nor does he expect change under Bush's secretary of state Colin Powell: \"If you take Republicans at their words, they'll probably be willing to use force only in more limited ways under the 'Powell doctrine' that says don't intervene except with massive and overwhelming force. That's only a nuance of difference with the Democrats.\" But he deems the new administration \"much more dangerous\" in its commitment to the national missile defence programme. \"It'll be interpreted as a first-strike weapon system by any potential adversary. It's absolutely insane.\" </p> <p>Fred Halliday, professor of international relations at the LSE, believes Chomsky, a luminary of a \"new anti-imperialism\", overestimates US power and underestimates a public shift in attitudes and debates on human rights in the past 10 years. \"He's become the guru of the new anti-capitalist and Third World movements. They take his views very uncritically; it's part of the Seattle mood - whatever America does is wrong. He confronts orthodoxy but he's becoming a big simplifier. What he can't see is Third World and other regimes that are oppressive and not controlled by America.\" </p> <p>Pinker believes a tendency to treat Chomsky as a \"guru and pontiff or a great satan\" is encouraged by his own style, \"which portrays people who disagree with him as stupid or evil, using withering scorn in his rhetoric. It's great sport if you identify with him, but it leads to equally extreme responses on the opposite side.\" For Neil Smith, however, Chomsky \"can be a ruthless debater in arguing for what he believes is the truth. He thinks faster than other people and tends to win arguments. But he's divisive only because he puts forward novel positions that undermine others.\" </p> <p> Chomsky drew flak in the early 80s for his stand for free speech in the case of Robert Faurisson, the French professor convicted in court of falsifying history for denying the existence of Nazi gas chambers. Chomsky says: \"The principle that the state should determine historical truth and punish those who say otherwise is a legacy of totalitarianism. In this case what the state determines to be true happens to be true, but that's irrelevant. It doesn't show great sympathy for the memory of victims of the holocaust to adopt the doctrines of their murderers.\" He also opposed the ITN libel case last year against LM magazine, which had alleged images of Trnopolje camp in Bosnia had been falsified - as a big media corporation muscling in against free speech. </p> <p>For the Oxford historian Stephen Howe, Chomsky has \"the faults as well as the virtues of the great moral crusader. Sometimes his attacks can seem excessive and indiscriminate.\" Phil Edwards, former culture editor of Red Pepper magazine, believes \"it's difficult to criticise Chomsky on the left - which is odd, given his own denunciation of conformity\". </p> <p>Chomsky himself discourages uncritical adherence to anyone's views, whether by Marxists or Freudians. He disavows the \"Talmudic certainty\" one commentator once attributed to him. \"It's a bad choice of words; the Talmud is anything but certain - it's full of debate and argument. But if it's true, it's a fault.\" </p> <p>On whether he is slowing down, he says: \"I have to retire, but I don't think anything will change. My professional work is intense and exciting, and political commitments grow. Something has to go if you try to live two intense lives - like relaxation. If my wife and I get to see one movie in a year, we consider it a triumph.\" But on Cape Cod they have a summer cottage and a sailing boat. \"It's the only way I can survive the rest of the year.\" </p> <p>For Pilger, who says Chomsky almost single-handedly exposed Indonesian atrocities in East Timor, he is a \"genuine people's hero; an inspiration for struggles all over the world for that basic decency known as freedom. To a lot of people in the margins - activists and movements - he's unfailingly supportive.\" While some sense cynicism (\"a realistic account of the way the world works will sound cynical\"), Chomsky favours Gramsci's \"pessisim of the intellect, optimism of the will\". In his own unique role as a moral conscience, insisting that the privileges of the \"free world\" should not rest on corpses elsewhere, some see a theological thrust; that he carries a higher moral torch for the world's most powerful country. </p> <p>\"There's truth in that,\" he says. \"I'm a citizen of the United States and I have a share of responsibility for what it does. I'd like to see it act in ways that meet decent moral standards. It's back to moral truisms: it's of little moral value to criticise the crimes of someone else - though you should do it, and tell the truth. I have no influence over the policies of Sudan but a certain degree over the policies of the US. It's not a matter of expectation but of aspiration.\"</p> <p><strong> Life at a glance:</strong> Avram Noam Chomsky </p> <p><strong>Born:</strong> December 7 1928, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Oak Lane Country Day School; Central High School, Phila- delphia;University of Pennsylvania. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> 1949 Carol Schatz (two daughters Avi, Diane; one son, Harry). </p> <p><strong> Career: </strong> 1951-55 Junior fellow, Harvard University; 1955- Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1961 professor, 1976- institute professor, linguistics and philosophy. </p> <p><strong> Some books:</strong> Syntactic Structures ('57), American Power And The New Mandarins (69) Language And Responsibility (79), The Chomsky Reader (87), Manufacturing Consent (88), Necessary Illusions (89), Deterring Democracy (92), Year 501 (93), World Orders, Old And New (97), Fateful Triangle (updated 99), The New Military Humanism (99), Rogue States (00), New Horizons In The Study Of Language and Mind (00), A New Generation Draws The Line (01). </p> <p>\u0095 A New Generation Draws The Line is published by Verso on February 20 at \u00a315.

While many friends stress Chomsky's work ethic, phenomenal memory, ironic sense of humour and self-effacement, Halle says he is \"not much for small talk; everything he does he takes seriously - with real commitment\". Chomsky was born in 1928 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the eldest of two boys. His father William, a Hebrew scholar, had fled Russia in 1913 to avoid being drafted into the Tsarist army. His mother Elsie, who came as an infant from Lithuania, also taught in Hebrew school. \"My immediate family was kind of a Jewish ghetto in Philadelphia,\" says Chomsky. \"My father's family was extremely orthodox, from an east European shtetl.\" His mother's relatives, who included communists, were \"unemployed and involved in a rich, vibrant intellectual life - ranging from music and art to political activity. Most had little formal education, but it was a lively working-class culture that happened to be Jewish.\" One uncle in New York, \"a hunchback with a background in crime\", ran a newsstand on the corner of 72nd Street and Broadway. Chomsky was a child of the Great Depression of 1929-39. \"By the standards of those days we were well off; both my parents had jobs.\" Among his earliest memories were \"seeing people coming to the door selling rags; and in a trolley car with my mother, I saw people beating up women strikers outside a textile factory\". He came early to political consciousness. \"I always felt isolated in my picture of the world. This was the late 30s; a time of political activism, debate, and great fear of Hitler conquering Europe. I saw the world as a complicated, frightening place.\" Survival was tough for \"the only Jewish family in a lower-middle-class neighbourhood that was mostly Irish and German Catholic, and rabidly anti-Semitic. The local kids went to Jesuit school, and I grew up with a visceral fear of Catholics. There were pro-Nazi beer parties at the fall of Paris. Then in December 1941 [after the Japanese attacked the US fleet at Pearl Harbor] the neighbourhood shifted 180 degrees. The same people who were cheering for the Nazis would open their doors wearing tin hats to say, 'pull down the blinds'. It was an educational experience.\" He adds: \"Neither my brother nor I talked to my parents about this. They were in the Jewish ghetto and we were partly out in the streets. But it wasn't the kind of thing you talked about.\" On the origins of his acute sense of moral responsibility, Chomsky is tentative: \"I was very moved as a young child by oppression, destruction, the intense fear of what was going on in Europe. I'd hear Hitler's speeches on the radio and see the reactions of my mother. By the time I was nine or 10 I was reading newspapers, and it went on from there. It seems obvious: you're responsible for your own actions, and their anticipated consequences.\" He was 16 when the US dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. \"I was in a Hebrew-speaking summer camp when news came. I found it shocking, and equally shocking to me was that nobody seemed to care. There was nobody to talk to because no-one saw it as an atrocity.\" While his progressive primary school had put a \"premium on individual creativity\", he found his high school - where he excelled - dullingly competitive. Chomsky sees the debate among immigrants as his political education. A lifelong anarchist or \"libertarian socialist\" - not a doctrine but a \"tendency in human thought\" - he believes \"violence, deceit and lawlessness are natural functions of the state\". At 10 he wrote an editorial for his school newspaper on the fall of Barcelona in the Spanish civil war, a \"lament about the rise of fascism\". \"I was always on the side of the losers,\" he said. He recalls: \"I spent my free time from age 13 picking up anarchist books in stores. I was quickly attracted to left anarchist critiques of the Bolsheviks, and [became] interested in the Spanish anarchist revolution which was crushed by communists.\" He was active in a \"fringe of Zionism\" - \"always opposed to a Jewish state, and in favour of a bi-nationalist outcome in Palestine based on Arab-Jewish co-operation, which wasn't so unrealistic at the time as it seems today\". In 1953 he spent six weeks on an Israeli kibbutz with his wife, Carol Schatz (now a linguist), whom he had known at Hebrew school and married in 1949. \"We seriously thought of moving there; I liked the life. The nice thing about physical labour is you have a finite task - when it's done, it's done. No one's going to second-guess you.\" But there were flaws in what Chomsky saw as an anarchist experiment. \"The way the Arabs, and even Oriental Jews, were treated was very ugly. The thing that disturbed me most was the ideological uniformity; it was deeply Stalinist - left and Buberite - which I found impossible to take.\" Drawn into linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania, where he worked under the libertarian Zellig Harris (and paid his way as a Hebrew schoolteacher), Chomsky became a junior fellow at Harvard. He moved down the road to MIT in 1955. \"Jews were barely tolerated in Harvard; they weren't part of the cultural life. One reason MIT became so great was that Jewish intellectuals couldn't get jobs elsewhere.\" He felt an outsider in other ways. \"I had no professional credentials. I got my position here in a research laboratory on electronics, of which I know nothing. But it happened to be the centre of innovative research and had no vested interests in the humanities. They were willing to experiment.\" His Syntactic Structures, published in 1957 when he was 29, revolutionised the study of language as part of psychology and biology. From his belief that, despite the Babel of tongues, humans share an innate language faculty, or \"organ\", grew his theory of an underlying Universal Grammar. New disciplines, from psycholinguistics to how children learn language, sprang from his ideas. According to Jean Aitchison, professor of language and communication at Oxford: \"In less than 120 pages, he turned linguistics from an obscure discipline, studied by missionaries, into a major social science. He shifted the question from the corpus of actual utterance to the mental system that produces it.\" Heir to Enlightenment ideas of language as a \"mirror of the mind\", Chomsky shares the Cartesian view that language is the human inheritance that most distinguishes man from animal or machine. (A chimpanzee whom researchers in the 1970s tried unsuccessfully to teach sign language was roguishly named Nim Chimpsky.) His work is still disparaged in some quarters as unscientific \"MIT mentalism\". Yet according to Steven Pinker, professor of psychology at MIT and author of The Language Instinct, Chomsky's \"theory of generative grammar is the most common single approach to linguistics even today. It's a minority view, but everyone sets their sights on it: it's the theory to beat.\" Chomsky's scathing 1959 review of BF Skinner, for whom language was merely learnt behaviour, bucked the empiricist tenet of the blank slate - that there is nothing in the mind that was not first in the senses. \"He gave the first, fatal shot to the school of behaviourism, and made theories of innate mental structure respectable after centuries of their being unthinkable,\" says Pinker, who hints at one link between theories of language and politics: \"Skinner said behaviour should be controlled; he wanted to turn society into a Skinner box - rewarding and punishing humans like the rats and pigeons in his experiments, a vision Chomsky described as like a \"well-run concentration camp\". Chomsky has tended to shy away from explicitly linking his linguistic and political theories. Others, though, link his insistence on universality - that everybody speaks \"human\" - and the creativity evidenced by language to his anarchist vision of free association. Political systems often rest on a view of human nature, and in his 1970 essay Language And Freedom, Chomsky wrote of language as a \"springboard\" for investigating that nature. \"Linkages were drawn in the 17th and 18th centuries between language as a fundamental, creative component of intelligence, and an instinct for freedom that could be the basis of how humans organise their lives,\" he says. \"I think there is something to it, though there's certainly no logical connection. \"But it's an interesting question as to why behaviourism had the appeal and prestige it did when it's so barren and shallow. Within the Marxist left - not including Marx - there's a strong tendency to insist there is no human nature; that people are just constructed by their historical circumstances and environment. This makes no sense, but these ideas are very convenient for those who aspire to managerial politics; they remove moral barriers to manipulation and coercion. \"If people have no fundamental human nature based on some instinct for freedom that can challenge and overthrow aggression and hierarchy, then there really are no moral values; if people are ignorant, malleable creatures who can be modified by experience and training, they can be controlled for their own good. That's an appealing idea to intellectuals across the political spectrum. Leninism is one expression of it, and social democracy is another.\" By 1961, Chomsky was a full professor at MIT, happy in his research, and with a young family. In 1964, supporting students against the draft, he began openly resisting the Vietnam war (\"it would have been hopelessly immoral not to\"). He rues it was \"already much too late; after the US invaded South Vietnam, what we call ethnic cleansing when others are doing it was going on from the early 60s. That was the time to get seriously involved.\" He knew there was no going back. \"It was a tremendous burden for my wife. She went back to college and got a degree partly because it looked as though I might go to jail.\" For years, he recalls, \"it was almost impossible to act publicly against the war. In Boston, a liberal city which likes to call itself the Athens of America, I spoke at the first major public meeting, in October 1965. We were attacked by hordes of people, and were only saved by the state police: they didn't like what we were saying but didn't want people murdered on Boston Common.\" He became a tax resister in 1966 and was arrested at the 1967 Pentagon protest. Norman Mailer, who was jailed with him, recalled a \"slim, sharp- featured man with an ascetic expression and an air of gentle but absolute moral authority\" - who seemed \"uneasy at the thought of missing class on Monday\". In his 1966 essay The Responsibility Of Intellectuals, Chomsky described their duty as being \"to speak the truth and to expose lies\". His first collection of political writings, American Power and the New Mandarins, was published in 1969. While intellectuals and \"commissars\" lie in the service of power, he suggests, it requires no expertise other than \"Cartesian common sense\" to understand politics or foreign affairs. Some critics have objected to an opposition between indoctrinated \"elites\" and \"the people\". He responds: \"In any inegalitarian society, there's a natural tendency for those who share wealth and power to try to maintain it. Some systems do it by force; others by gaining the consent of the population, or at least their passivity.\" In Manufacturing Consent, co-authored with Edward Herman, Chomsky proposed a model of the mass media that moulds this consent with bias and omission. \"Propaganda is to democracy what violence is to totalitarianism,\" they wrote. While some see the \"propaganda model\" as reducing everyone to dupes or liars, others have dismissed it as conspiracy theory. \"It's exactly the opposite - it's free-market theory,\" says Chomsky. \"The media are major corporations. They sell a product (readers or viewers) to a market (advertisers). If a Martian were looking at this system, what would he expect? That the media product would be shaped by the perspectives and interests of the sellers and buyers and the external conditions (the state). You'd expect no interaction at all. It's no more a conspiracy than that General Motors tries to make a profit.\" The internet is a means of evading media limitations, he believes, citing protests, such as those in Seattle, which were heavily reliant on net organisation. But he sees a struggle being waged, since net development was handed to private corporations in the mid-90s, between its use as an \"information superhighway\"and as a channel for \"ecommerce\". He says: \"As long as it was in the public sector it was free and open but limited; few people had access. Now access is wider, but the freedom is under attack.\" In Deterring Democracy, and other books on international affairs, Chomsky has copiously documented how Washington thwarts democratic experiments across the globe. Though his focus is increasingly on economic and trade issues, he continues to hold the US to account as a \"rogue superpower\" which distinguishes between \"worthy\" and \"unworthy\" victims of atrocity depending on whether they take place in a client state or in an \"official enemy\". He claims that if the Nuremberg laws had been applied then every post-war American president would have been hanged. He was accused of playing down Khmer Rouge atrocities in Cambodia, but maintains he was merely telling the truth about the number of deaths. \"We also pointed out that casualties of American bombing had been greatly exaggerated, but no one criticised us for correcting that.\" Nor does he expect change under Bush's secretary of state Colin Powell: \"If you take Republicans at their words, they'll probably be willing to use force only in more limited ways under the 'Powell doctrine' that says don't intervene except with massive and overwhelming force. That's only a nuance of difference with the Democrats.\" But he deems the new administration \"much more dangerous\" in its commitment to the national missile defence programme. \"It'll be interpreted as a first-strike weapon system by any potential adversary. It's absolutely insane.\" Fred Halliday, professor of international relations at the LSE, believes Chomsky, a luminary of a \"new anti-imperialism\", overestimates US power and underestimates a public shift in attitudes and debates on human rights in the past 10 years. \"He's become the guru of the new anti-capitalist and Third World movements. They take his views very uncritically; it's part of the Seattle mood - whatever America does is wrong. He confronts orthodoxy but he's becoming a big simplifier. What he can't see is Third World and other regimes that are oppressive and not controlled by America.\" Pinker believes a tendency to treat Chomsky as a \"guru and pontiff or a great satan\" is encouraged by his own style, \"which portrays people who disagree with him as stupid or evil, using withering scorn in his rhetoric. It's great sport if you identify with him, but it leads to equally extreme responses on the opposite side.\" For Neil Smith, however, Chomsky \"can be a ruthless debater in arguing for what he believes is the truth. He thinks faster than other people and tends to win arguments. But he's divisive only because he puts forward novel positions that undermine others.\" Chomsky drew flak in the early 80s for his stand for free speech in the case of Robert Faurisson, the French professor convicted in court of falsifying history for denying the existence of Nazi gas chambers. Chomsky says: \"The principle that the state should determine historical truth and punish those who say otherwise is a legacy of totalitarianism. In this case what the state determines to be true happens to be true, but that's irrelevant. It doesn't show great sympathy for the memory of victims of the holocaust to adopt the doctrines of their murderers.\" He also opposed the ITN libel case last year against LM magazine, which had alleged images of Trnopolje camp in Bosnia had been falsified - as a big media corporation muscling in against free speech. For the Oxford historian Stephen Howe, Chomsky has \"the faults as well as the virtues of the great moral crusader. Sometimes his attacks can seem excessive and indiscriminate.\" Phil Edwards, former culture editor of Red Pepper magazine, believes \"it's difficult to criticise Chomsky on the left - which is odd, given his own denunciation of conformity\". Chomsky himself discourages uncritical adherence to anyone's views, whether by Marxists or Freudians. He disavows the \"Talmudic certainty\" one commentator once attributed to him. \"It's a bad choice of words; the Talmud is anything but certain - it's full of debate and argument. But if it's true, it's a fault.\" On whether he is slowing down, he says: \"I have to retire, but I don't think anything will change. My professional work is intense and exciting, and political commitments grow. Something has to go if you try to live two intense lives - like relaxation. If my wife and I get to see one movie in a year, we consider it a triumph.\" But on Cape Cod they have a summer cottage and a sailing boat. \"It's the only way I can survive the rest of the year.\" For Pilger, who says Chomsky almost single-handedly exposed Indonesian atrocities in East Timor, he is a \"genuine people's hero; an inspiration for struggles all over the world for that basic decency known as freedom. To a lot of people in the margins - activists and movements - he's unfailingly supportive.\" While some sense cynicism (\"a realistic account of the way the world works will sound cynical\"), Chomsky favours Gramsci's \"pessisim of the intellect, optimism of the will\". In his own unique role as a moral conscience, insisting that the privileges of the \"free world\" should not rest on corpses elsewhere, some see a theological thrust; that he carries a higher moral torch for the world's most powerful country. \"There's truth in that,\" he says. \"I'm a citizen of the United States and I have a share of responsibility for what it does. I'd like to see it act in ways that meet decent moral standards. It's back to moral truisms: it's of little moral value to criticise the crimes of someone else - though you should do it, and tell the truth. I have no influence over the policies of Sudan but a certain degree over the policies of the US. It's not a matter of expectation but of aspiration.\" Life at a glance: Avram Noam Chomsky Born: December 7 1928, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania..

      "body": "<p>\u0095 A Heartbreaking Work Of Staggering Genius was Dave Eggers' true, or almost all true, memoir of his life acting as quasi parent to his young brother, Toph, after their mother and father died. The book was an astonishing critical and popular success both in the US and in Britain. In the months following publication, Eggers has had time to mull over what he did, what he put in, what he left out, and respond to readers, admirers and naysayers. He has made a few changes to the original text for a new edition, but mostly what he has done is to add an extra chunk. These are some extracts from this latest instalment, Mistakes We Knew We Were Making. <br></p> <p>This appendix was supposed to, and almost did, accompany the original hardcover edition of the book. A version of it was nearly complete, when its author made the mistake of telling a writer friend about it, with, let's admit, a certain smugness. I was, I figured, the first to think of adding a corrective appendix to a nonfiction work, one meant to illuminate the many factual and temporal fudgings necessary to keep this, or really any, work of nonfiction from dragging around in arcana and endless explanations of who was exactly where, and when, etc. So: the corrective appendix was being prepared, and was to follow the original text, a few pages after the final \"finally\".</p> <p> But upon telling this writer-friend about the idea, she said, while looking much too ravishing over an open candle and with wet hair, \"Oh, right, like Mary McCarthy.\" There was, in the distance, the sound of thunder, and of lightning striking, presumably, a kitten. \"Um, what do you mean, pray tell, Just like Mary McCarthy?\" I thought, while, fear-stricken, managing only \"Huh?\" She noted that McCarthy had done almost the same thing in Memories Of A Catholic Girlhood, a book about which I was of course unware, because I am a moron. She explained that after each chapter recounting various episodes from McCarthy's youth, there was a slightly shorter chapter, set in italics, wherein the author dismantled the narrative, in favour of the unshaped truth.</p> <p>Each corrective chapter, the writer-friend pointed out, began with something like: Well, it didn't happen exactly that way... And this was exactly my goal in adding the appendix in the first place: it afforded the opportunity to be completely factual about things that in the narrative had to be compressed or altered slightly so the book could continue apace. But after this illuminating dinner, I sought and found a copy of McCarthy's book (paperback edition with horrific cover), and after reading McCarthy's perfect execution of the idea, I abandoned my own appendix, not wanting to invest too much in a notion already used. And besides, I felt, the stupid goddamn book was obviously long enough. Thus, about 40 pages of prime appendix were scrapped. But now, about eight brutal and then exhilarating and then more-brutal-than-before months after the book was originally published, I've gone ahead and finished the appendix, for better or worse. </p> <p><strong>Many names have been changed </strong><br></p> <p>Yes, and I've taken out the phone numbers, too. Writing the first edition, I placed much weight on employing as many real names as possible, using their actual working phone numbers, everything, to prove a point that one could be completely factual, and still tell a story that felt and read novelistic, somewhat timeless, at least fluid. Changing all the names or, worse, making it all fictional (semi-autobiographical) seemed cowardly and silly. And so before publication I approached people whose names were used, and asked their permission. All readily agreed, but now, many of the people who initially said yes have had second thoughts. A typical conversation before publication: \"Is it okay to use your real name?\" \"Sure, why not?\" Typical conversation a month after publication: \"Would it be possible to remove my name?\" \"Of course. Why?\" \"Well, no offence, but I really didn't think anyone would see the damn book.\" </p> <p>A slightly different thing happened with the three friends who allowed the usage of their phone numbers. I assumed that after a few months, those whose numbers were listed would have been so besieged by creative teenagers at sleepovers that they'd have to change their numbers, a service I promised to pay for. And yet: approximate number of copies of this book sold in hardcover form: 200,000; approximate number of readers of this book, considering library use and pass-along: maybe 400,000; thus, how weird is this: Number of calls Marny received: 7 Number of calls Kirsten received: 12 Total calls for KC: 5 Total number of calls: 24. Those that did call often hung up; those that spoke were very nice. But overall, a remarkable thing: a gaspingly low percentage of phoners, especially given just how easy and convenient telephone use can be. </p> <p> My guess is that a majority of people either a) assumed the numbers were phoney or outdated; b) were exceedingly polite and respectful of the privacy of nonfictional book characters; or c) never actually made it that far into the book, a failure for which I cast no outward blame. The fault, of course, is mine. Why, then, have we changed most of the names in the book? Because I've lost my taste for this sort of courage. I thought it was courageous to write about these things, and I thought it was equally courageous for my friends and me to use our names and phone numbers, and to allow our exploits and sexploits to be recounted in print for the consumption of our parents and aunts and nephews.</p> <p> But now, when so many have asked for name-changes, and so many have been shocked by who/how many have seen all these words, I've decided to let most of the people - save some primary characters - breathe easier and live freer, by allowing them to slip back into semi-fictional personae. In a few cases, where I had originally lashed out at real people in backhanded ways, and used their real names in doing so, I have removed or softened these parts, because in the last year I've also, almost completely, lost my taste for blood.</p> <p>One of the things that mercifully isn't covered in the book is the author's truly iffy and semi-brief career as a cartoonist. For the entire time covered in the book, I was doing a weekly cartoon for SF Weekly, a newspaper published a few blocks from the offices of Might [a magazine Eggers and some friends were producing in San Francisco]. The cartoon, as Might did, sought to engage its readers, to provoke interaction, however glancing, and thus had an abiding curiosity in how people would react to solicitations placed within its clumsily rendered borders.</p> <p> Accordingly, one of its favourite experiments involved the giving away of the original artwork used in the cartoon, via the trunk of my car. At the time, after our Civic was crushed by the SUV en route to my sister's Kiss-featuring wedding, we bought a 1972 BMW 2002, a truly funny and perfect car, coloured chartreuse. And so I made an offer to the readers, that if they should see the car parked on any city street, that they should open the trunk, which would be unlocked always, and inside they would find drawings used in published cartoons. They could take a drawing, sign a register indicating who they were and what they took, and then they could go on their way, merrily. It worked. In a few weeks, all the artwork was gone, and everyone had signed their names. </p> <p> So then, drunk on trust, I started leaving not only the trunk open but all the cars' doors unlocked. And in about six months of this, never was anything stolen or the car other-wise molested, outside of the pollution littered under the car's windshield wipers by the city's vigilant and efficient and completely evil meter maids, venal and carnivorous people in ridiculous helmets, may they and their overlords all burn in Hell eternally with much crackling and bubbling and searing of melted flesh. The point is that trust is usually rewarded, even though trust is sometimes violated, horribly. Trust is fun. It is fun to trust strangers. It is fun to risk what you can reasonably risk - like, your car, or your reputation - on the trust of people you know only through something ephemeral shared, something like taste in books or cartoons, or having watched people suffer. </p> <p><strong>The kayak trip </strong><br></p> <p> Also removed was a fantastic scene - 100 per cent true - featuring most of the book's primary characters, and a whale. We had been given a chance to try out, for free, a new hearty tourist's tour - a kayak trip around Angel Island. It's hilly, heavily forested but, since the early 1900s - when it served as sort of a West Coast Ellis Island - an uninhabited and largely uneventful rock, dumped in the middle of San Francisco Bay. Asserting our freedom to leave the office on any day or at any time, four of us from work went at noon, took a ferry from Fisherman's Wharf and once at the island, we paired up: Marny and I in one kayak, Moodie and Zev in another. The guide, in a single-seater, rounded out the party, and we set out. The guide's name was not Bart, but we will be calling him Bart. Ocean kayaking is very often very boring. Whereas whitewater kayaking has built-in interest, involving foam and speed enjoyed without having to self-generate that speed, ocean kayaking (which is essentially what a Bay kayak trip is) is akin to cross-country skiing - the pace is slow, the sights are unchanging and the work is tedious. And speed, really the only reason to partake in any sport, is almost impossible to achieve to any satisfactory degree. </p> <p> The day was blue and yellow, and there was no wind. About halfway around the island, my shoulders already hurt like a mother; I was having some kind of rotator cuff problem. Naturally I thought of Jim McMahon [American footballer] and his own rotator cuff problems. Then thought of his headbands. And his part in The Super Bowl Shuffle, the now-wildly underrated football anthem from 1984. Then of Walter Payton, easily one of the most graceful athletes in any sport ever, in whose body cancer was already taking root, growing, planning expansion, sprawling, though no one yet knew it. </p> <p> Then. There! About a thousand yards into the Bay, toward the city, a sudden plume of steam, coming from a shiny grey-black sliver rounded over the water's surface. A whale. Fuck me, a whale, someone said. Almost surely someone said that. Then it disappeared. Then someone said: Holy shit. Then: Jesus fuck. We paddled furiously toward it, making our way to the site of breach, and when we got there, we waited. It was silly, really: we knew the whale was gone, so to look for it in the precise location it had appeared would assume that it was just bobbing in place, below us, which of course it was not. Whales do not bob in place; whales are on the move, whales have places to go. But still we waited, because we are dumb people who do dumb things. </p> <p> It was bright. The city was white to our left, and the ocean was straight ahead, a few miles west. The water was still, and we rested our paddles on the kayaks. Our legs were underwater but dry. Our faces were getting burned. We took handfuls of the Bay's cold and wet our faces and our necks. We scanned the surface for a break. Then: it came up again, this time about 500 yards toward the ocean. Same plume, same huge grey-black back breaking the surface, turning like a slow, dull bandsaw. Goddamn, someone said. Again we sped toward the location of its last appearance. Bart was excited. Bart had been kayaking in the Bay for years and years, and had never seen anything like this, a whale, in person, not 500 yards away. We arrived where we had last seen it: nothing. We felt stupid again, but less stupid than before: maybe he, the whale, knew we were here, watching him; maybe our chasing him had induced his second appearance. Whales are smart, and if whales are smart, surely they enjoy these kinds of chasing games, as do all smart animals, like dogs, and dolphins, and many others I could name but will not, including those known as pigs, a kind of animal which everyone claims is smart, without any impressive behavioural evidence to back it up. </p> <p> So we waited. Three, five minutes. Then, into the Bay, again: the plume, the back, holy Jesus. A third appearance, this time 300 yards from its last. We didn't know what to do: follow it again? Just wait for the next breach? Wouldn't we have a better chance of a close-up visit if we stayed put? We decided to paddle halfway toward it, and then wait. We did, and once there, we put our paddles down, exhausted. My rotator cuff ached. I thought of Jim McMahon again. And then of Jim McMahon's sunglasses, which were big, and wrapped around his head - in the early 80s, a new and mysterious thing. Who was he playing for now? Was he still so intriguingly rebellious? We were in the middle of the Bay, a few inches out of the water, on a blue and yellow day, and we were chasing a whale. We looked at each other and grinned. But we were tired. We were tired, and were thinking that we really should get moving, toward the beach, where we planned to have our lunch. </p> <p> We were arranged like this [the guide nearest the last sighting of the whale, one kayak parallell with him and the other bridging the other two kayaks, looking like a kayak stonehenge]: Again we waited. This time about 10 minutes. We were content, because we were tired, and because we were already satisfied, having seen a whale, while kayaking, in the Bay, near our homes, in our city, on a clear day while we were young. </p> <p> Now. See the \"x\"? [The \"x\" is between the two parallell kayaks] That's where the motherfucker came up. He surfaced right between us. Not three feet away from our kayak. Much closer to Bart's. More than close. It was under Bart's kayak, not just under it but under it in such a way that when it surfaced, Bart's kayak was on top of the whale. It scared the piss out of us. I yelped. Everyone else made more civilised sounds. Gasps. I thought the whale might eat us. Then Bart, God bless him, while he was being lifted from the water by this 40ft monster, had the presence of mind to reach down and touch it. The whale - God, thinking about it now, it seems like it was there, between us all, for hours - it had this big dull eye, and the eye was looking at us, and the whale's whole back was bumped and barnacled, a thousand years old, and his mouth could have crushed us all, toothless though, the thing hardly an animal and more like a huge rough rock, a big rubbery rock rolling under us... And then it sunk from under Bart's kayak, setting the kayak's shiny fibreglass bottom back upon the surface, and in a second it was gone. </p> <p> And right then, if I was ever unsure of it before, I was certain that we had been marked. When a whale surfaces between your kayaks - chooses, among any of 2 or 3 million places in a Bay to breach, chooses a spot between your tiny plastic kayaks - this giant ancient creature, who very well might be some kind of alien, a billion years old and maybe the creator of the whole world and everything in it (why not?), has come from the blue-grey depths to terrify you - that means everything is possible.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 A Heartbreaking Work Of Staggering Genius was Dave Eggers' true, or almost all true, memoir of his life acting as quasi parent to his young brother, Toph, after their mother and father died. The book was an astonishing critical and popular success both in the US and in Britain. In the months following publication, Eggers has had time to mull over what he did, what he put in, what he left out, and respond to readers, admirers and naysayers. He has made a few changes to the original text for a new edition, but mostly what he has done is to add an extra chunk. These are some extracts from this latest instalment, Mistakes We Knew We Were Making. This appendix was supposed to, and almost did, accompany the original hardcover edition of the book. A version of it was nearly complete, when its author made the mistake of telling a writer friend about it, with, let's admit, a certain smugness. I was, I figured, the first to think of adding a corrective appendix to a nonfiction work, one meant to illuminate the many factual and temporal fudgings necessary to keep this, or really any, work of nonfiction from dragging around in arcana and endless explanations of who was exactly where, and when, etc. So: the corrective appendix was being prepared, and was to follow the original text, a few pages after the final \"finally\". But upon telling this writer-friend about the idea, she said, while looking much too ravishing over an open candle and with wet hair, \"Oh, right, like Mary McCarthy.\" There was, in the distance, the sound of thunder, and of lightning striking, presumably, a kitten. \"Um, what do you mean, pray tell, Just like Mary McCarthy?\" I thought, while, fear-stricken, managing only \"Huh?\" She noted that McCarthy had done almost the same thing in Memories Of A Catholic Girlhood, a book about which I was of course unware, because I am a moron. She explained that after each chapter recounting various episodes from McCarthy's youth, there was a slightly shorter chapter, set in italics, wherein the author dismantled the narrative, in favour of the unshaped truth. Each corrective chapter, the writer-friend pointed out, began with something like: Well, it didn't happen exactly that way... And this was exactly my goal in adding the appendix in the first place: it afforded the opportunity to be completely factual about things that in the narrative had to be compressed or altered slightly so the book could continue apace. But after this illuminating dinner, I sought and found a copy of McCarthy's book (paperback edition with horrific cover), and after reading McCarthy's perfect execution of the idea, I abandoned my own appendix, not wanting to invest too much in a notion already used. And besides, I felt, the stupid goddamn book was obviously long enough. Thus, about 40 pages of prime appendix were scrapped. But now, about eight brutal and then exhilarating and then more-brutal-than-before months after the book was originally published, I've gone ahead and finished the appendix, for better or worse. Many names have been changed Yes, and I've taken out the phone numbers, too. Writing the first edition, I placed much weight on employing as many real names as possible, using their actual working phone numbers, everything, to prove a point that one could be completely factual, and still tell a story that felt and read novelistic, somewhat timeless, at least fluid. Changing all the names or, worse, making it all fictional (semi-autobiographical) seemed cowardly and silly. And so before publication I approached people whose names were used, and asked their permission. All readily agreed, but now, many of the people who initially said yes have had second thoughts. A typical conversation before publication: \"Is it okay to use your real name?\" \"Sure, why not?\" Typical conversation a month after publication: \"Would it be possible to remove my name?\" \"Of course. Why?\" \"Well, no offence, but I really didn't think anyone would see the damn book.\" A slightly different thing happened with the three friends who allowed the usage of their phone numbers. I assumed that after a few months, those whose numbers were listed would have been so besieged by creative teenagers at sleepovers that they'd have to change their numbers, a service I promised to pay for. And yet: approximate number of copies of this book sold in hardcover form: 200,000; approximate number of readers of this book, considering library use and pass-along: maybe 400,000; thus, how weird is this: Number of calls Marny received: 7 Number of calls Kirsten received: 12 Total calls for KC: 5 Total number of calls: 24. Those that did call often hung up; those that spoke were very nice. But overall, a remarkable thing: a gaspingly low percentage of phoners, especially given just how easy and convenient telephone use can be. My guess is that a majority of people either a) assumed the numbers were phoney or outdated; b) were exceedingly polite and respectful of the privacy of nonfictional book characters; or c) never actually made it that far into the book, a failure for which I cast no outward blame. The fault, of course, is mine. Why, then, have we changed most of the names in the book? Because I've lost my taste for this sort of courage. I thought it was courageous to write about these things, and I thought it was equally courageous for my friends and me to use our names and phone numbers, and to allow our exploits and sexploits to be recounted in print for the consumption of our parents and aunts and nephews. But now, when so many have asked for name-changes, and so many have been shocked by who/how many have seen all these words, I've decided to let most of the people - save some primary characters - breathe easier and live freer, by allowing them to slip back into semi-fictional personae. In a few cases, where I had originally lashed out at real people in backhanded ways, and used their real names in doing so, I have removed or softened these parts, because in the last year I've also, almost completely, lost my taste for blood. One of the things that mercifully isn't covered in the book is the author's truly iffy and semi-brief career as a cartoonist. For the entire time covered in the book, I was doing a weekly cartoon for SF Weekly, a newspaper published a few blocks from the offices of Might [a magazine Eggers and some friends were producing in San Francisco]. The cartoon, as Might did, sought to engage its readers, to provoke interaction, however glancing, and thus had an abiding curiosity in how people would react to solicitations placed within its clumsily rendered borders. Accordingly, one of its favourite experiments involved the giving away of the original artwork used in the cartoon, via the trunk of my car. At the time, after our Civic was crushed by the SUV en route to my sister's Kiss-featuring wedding, we bought a 1972 BMW 2002, a truly funny and perfect car, coloured chartreuse. And so I made an offer to the readers, that if they should see the car parked on any city street, that they should open the trunk, which would be unlocked always, and inside they would find drawings used in published cartoons. They could take a drawing, sign a register indicating who they were and what they took, and then they could go on their way, merrily. It worked. In a few weeks, all the artwork was gone, and everyone had signed their names. So then, drunk on trust, I started leaving not only the trunk open but all the cars' doors unlocked. And in about six months of this, never was anything stolen or the car other-wise molested, outside of the pollution littered under the car's windshield wipers by the city's vigilant and efficient and completely evil meter maids, venal and carnivorous people in ridiculous helmets, may they and their overlords all burn in Hell eternally with much crackling and bubbling and searing of melted flesh. The point is that trust is usually rewarded, even though trust is sometimes violated, horribly. Trust is fun. It is fun to trust strangers. It is fun to risk what you can reasonably risk - like, your car, or your reputation - on the trust of people you know only through something ephemeral shared, something like taste in books or cartoons, or having watched people suffer. The kayak trip Also removed was a fantastic scene - 100 per cent true - featuring most of the book's primary characters, and a whale. We had been given a chance to try out, for free, a new hearty tourist's tour - a kayak trip around Angel Island. It's hilly, heavily forested but, since the early 1900s - when it served as sort of a West Coast Ellis Island - an uninhabited and largely uneventful rock, dumped in the middle of San Francisco Bay. Asserting our freedom to leave the office on any day or at any time, four of us from work went at noon, took a ferry from Fisherman's Wharf and once at the island, we paired up: Marny and I in one kayak, Moodie and Zev in another. The guide, in a single-seater, rounded out the party, and we set out. The guide's name was not Bart, but we will be calling him Bart. Ocean kayaking is very often very boring. Whereas whitewater kayaking has built-in interest, involving foam and speed enjoyed without having to self-generate that speed, ocean kayaking (which is essentially what a Bay kayak trip is) is akin to cross-country skiing - the pace is slow, the sights are unchanging and the work is tedious. And speed, really the only reason to partake in any sport, is almost impossible to achieve to any satisfactory degree. The day was blue and yellow, and there was no wind. About halfway around the island, my shoulders already hurt like a mother; I was having some kind of rotator cuff problem. Naturally I thought of Jim McMahon [American footballer] and his own rotator cuff problems. Then thought of his headbands. And his part in The Super Bowl Shuffle, the now-wildly underrated football anthem from 1984. Then of Walter Payton, easily one of the most graceful athletes in any sport ever, in whose body cancer was already taking root, growing, planning expansion, sprawling, though no one yet knew it. Then. There! About a thousand yards into the Bay, toward the city, a sudden plume of steam, coming from a shiny grey-black sliver rounded over the water's surface. A whale. Fuck me, a whale, someone said. Almost surely someone said that. Then it disappeared. Then someone said: Holy shit. Then: Jesus fuck. We paddled furiously toward it, making our way to the site of breach, and when we got there, we waited. It was silly, really: we knew the whale was gone, so to look for it in the precise location it had appeared would assume that it was just bobbing in place, below us, which of course it was not. Whales do not bob in place; whales are on the move, whales have places to go. But still we waited, because we are dumb people who do dumb things. It was bright. The city was white to our left, and the ocean was straight ahead, a few miles west. The water was still, and we rested our paddles on the kayaks. Our legs were underwater but dry. Our faces were getting burned. We took handfuls of the Bay's cold and wet our faces and our necks. We scanned the surface for a break. Then: it came up again, this time about 500 yards toward the ocean. Same plume, same huge grey-black back breaking the surface, turning like a slow, dull bandsaw. Goddamn, someone said. Again we sped toward the location of its last appearance. Bart was excited. Bart had been kayaking in the Bay for years and years, and had never seen anything like this, a whale, in person, not 500 yards away. We arrived where we had last seen it: nothing. We felt stupid again, but less stupid than before: maybe he, the whale, knew we were here, watching him; maybe our chasing him had induced his second appearance. Whales are smart, and if whales are smart, surely they enjoy these kinds of chasing games, as do all smart animals, like dogs, and dolphins, and many others I could name but will not, including those known as pigs, a kind of animal which everyone claims is smart, without any impressive behavioural evidence to back it up. So we waited. Three, five minutes. Then, into the Bay, again: the plume, the back, holy Jesus. A third appearance, this time 300 yards from its last. We didn't know what to do: follow it again? Just wait for the next breach? Wouldn't we have a better chance of a close-up visit if we stayed put? We decided to paddle halfway toward it, and then wait. We did, and once there, we put our paddles down, exhausted. My rotator cuff ached. I thought of Jim McMahon again. And then of Jim McMahon's sunglasses, which were big, and wrapped around his head - in the early 80s, a new and mysterious thing. Who was he playing for now? Was he still so intriguingly rebellious? We were in the middle of the Bay, a few inches out of the water, on a blue and yellow day, and we were chasing a whale. We looked at each other and grinned. But we were tired.

Did he look through a microscope for bacillus coli rods, and what is that red dot doing there on the outer rim of the world? Someone sees a shin bone. Be serious; this is art, his life's work, and we are outmoded in the way we try to see a womb, a hole in the wall, and, yes, a boiled egg. If we were younger he would rap us over the knuckles for talking in the back row. When he leaves, he looks, we think, a little distrait, and abstracted. \u0095 From Appetites of Love by Elizabeth Bartlett. Published by Bloodaxe Books, price \u00a37.95",

      "body": "<p>Soon after the publication of his first collection of poetry in 1988, Mornings in the Baltic, Adam Thorpe was asked by a perceptive editor whether he had considered writing a novel. Thorpe conceded that he had, dug out a few stories he had been working on for the previous six or seven years and began work on what was to become Ulverton, his virtuoso and highly praised account of the lives of 12 generations of inhabitants of a single English village. The publication in paperback this month of his sequence of stories based around the world of work, Shifts, indicates that long gestation periods seem to suit him. </p> <p>\"I started Shifts pretty much at the same time as Ulverton ,\" he says. But getting the three elements necessary for each story - the person telling it, the story itself and the work - has taken me all this time.\" Thorpe has used material from jobs he did, \"when times were hard or when I was a student; eg neon-bulb factory machine operator, dustman, airline dish washer,\" but listening to him talk about his literary life it is clear that his real occupation has always been as a writer. \"I started my first novel when I was 11. I sat in the back room of the optician's where my mother worked and wrote about a man chasing his hat on a windy day through Chesham. But, as usually happens when writing a novel, the doldrums set in and I gave up at about page 13. But it was an absolutely serious attempt to write this novel.\" </p> <p>Thorpe says he remembers his early reading as being, \"rather old fashioned\". He was born in Paris and as a child moved to Beirut and then Calcutta before his family went to the Congo and Cameroon and Thorpe went to boarding school in England. </p> <p>\"We had a beautiful Everyman edition of the Just So stories. I was absolutely haunted by them, particularly Kipling's pictures. They were very weird and highly designed but I did like stuff that faintly frightened me. There was also an abridged edition of Dickens's A Christmas Carol with a picture of Marley's ghost on it that absolutely petrified me. Kidnapped and Treasure Island with Blind Pew were also central.\" </p> <p>In his mid teens he became interested in poetry and, because of his unhappiness at school, would spend long periods of time on his own in the library making anthologies for his younger sister. \"I remember doing an animal anthology with Lawrence's The Snake and Ted Hughes's The Horses,\" he says. \"I'd re-write them out in fountain pen and find pictures to go with them. It was a great way of learning them.\" </p> <p>When he was 17 he \"stumbled across\" Mercian Hymns, Geoffrey Hill's influential poetry sequence. It was the decisive literary moment. \"Here was someone who was expressing something about England that seemed to me very important,\" Thorpe explains. \"He mingled the past and the present and talked about history and tyranny and suffering. As a schoolboy trying to understand my own personal past as well as that of the country I was part of, it was a revelation.\" </p> <p>While at this stage Thorpe couldn't conceive of writing as a career, he also couldn't see himself sitting behind a desk or teaching. \"I was in love with the romantic idea of being a poet, but I was also attracted by the theatre.\" </p> <p>After university Thorpe did become a teacher of theatre and mime as well as touring villages in Berkshire and Wiltshire as a sort of \"wandering minstrel.\" He says he, \"burrowed round looking for folk tales. The idea was to keep local and relate to the local community. I was concerned to put down roots as I had had a fairly rootless childhood in many ways. That's where most of the inspiration for Ulverton came from and three of the tales ended up in Ulverton.\" </p> <p>Despite its apparent quintessential Englishness, Ulverton has travelled well and has been much translated. Thorpe, who now lives in France, says in fact the reaction of French readers is very similar to that of English readers. \"The Englishness doesn't seem to feature. The French relate to it because the themes are universal and not particularly English at all; the concentration on rural issues and so on.\" </p> <p>He has gone on to publish two more collections of poetry, a play and two more novels - Still and Pieces of Light - with a third due this summer. He has also recently written a radio play, Something Memorable, based on Thomas Hardy's \"The Darkling Thrush\". Working on the play has made him think he must go back to try his hand at a another full-length play. An impulse made stronger by his experience of writing the stories in Shifts. </p> <p>\"There is a compression and an intensity to a short story which is closer to poetry or drama than the novel. But one has to be careful not to stifle the story by over-compressing it. There is an illusion of something more relaxed, that this is a fragment of somebody's life or narrative. There must be a sense that these are things caught on the wind, something overheard. It was Doris Lessing who said that writers are like magpies who pick up glittery things to line their nests and that is exactly what I have been doing. I've been going round with my eyes and ears open for anything that would feed into Shifts. The soil had been ready to be seeded for nine years and has been seeded by anything that happened to drift into my view.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Something Memorable will be broadcast on Radio 4 on Friday at 2.15pm.</p>",

Ours didn't, but it was still large and comfy. </p> <p><strong> Bathroom luxury:</strong> </p> <p>Outstanding. Huge with (height of luxury) two sinks, a walk-in shower and a large whirlpool bath. Generous quantities of smellies by Molton Brown plus fluffy bathrobe, slippers, the works. </p> <p><strong> The restaurant:</strong> </p> <p>Award-winning and delicious range of modern and traditional food. Three-course table d'hote very reasonable (lunch for two without wine came to less than \u00a350) and dinner is a suitably pampered occasion, with cocktails and canapes served in the lounge. Light meals can be served in your room. </p> <p><strong> The lounge:</strong> </p> <p>Oak panelled and real log fires. Better yet is the basement games room with two full-size snooker tables and bar billiards. </p> <p><strong> What is there to see within walking distance?</strong> </p> <p>You'd be hard pushed to walk to the end of the driveway. </p> <p><strong> What is there to see nearby?</strong> </p> <p>Visit Ann Boleyn's ghost at Hever Castle or play pooh sticks at Pooh Corner. </p> <p><strong> How much a night?</strong> </p> <p>Singles from \u00a3120 to \u00a3175, suites from \u00a3230 to \u00a3330.

      "bodyText": "Address: Wych Cross, Forest Row, East Sussex RH18 5JR. Reservations: Small Luxury Hotels of the World, tel: 00 800 525 48000 Web address: www.slh.com First impressions: Huge country-house estate. The kind of place that Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy set up home in together. With a neighbouring chapel, this former convent is in grounds with 186 acres of lakes, lawns, trails and gardens. Stunning. What are the rooms like? Our Fairway suite opened out on to the golf course. Extremely spacious with large double bed, sofa and two arm-chairs, satellite TV, bottles of still and sparkling water plus tea- and coffee-making. The bed test: Some rooms have four-poster beds. Ours didn't, but it was still large and comfy. Bathroom luxury: Outstanding. Huge with (height of luxury) two sinks, a walk-in shower and a large whirlpool bath. Generous quantities of smellies by Molton Brown plus fluffy bathrobe, slippers, the works. The restaurant: Award-winning and delicious range of modern and traditional food. Three-course table d'hote very reasonable (lunch for two without wine came to less than \u00a350) and dinner is a suitably pampered occasion, with cocktails and canapes served in the lounge. Light meals can be served in your room. The lounge: Oak panelled and real log fires. Better yet is the basement games room with two full-size snooker tables and bar billiards. What is there to see within walking distance? You'd be hard pushed to walk to the end of the driveway. What is there to see nearby? Visit Ann Boleyn's ghost at Hever Castle or play pooh sticks at Pooh Corner. How much a night? Singles from \u00a3120 to \u00a3175, suites from \u00a3230 to \u00a3330. Includes dinner, full English breakfast and membership of the country club for your stay. Various weekend break deals available.",

He enjoys a surprisingly warm relationship with employees, given the fearsome reputation he carries from his time as manufacturing director in the old, pre-BMW regime.</p> <p>\"Hi, Terry,\" he says to an assembly line worker scarred by two decades of despair and doubt at Rover. \"What's the mood?\" Terry replies: \"Best I've known. We've had the Japanese [Honda], the Germans [BMW] and now we're back in English control so if we can't make it now, it's our fault. But it's down to you - I'm just a small cog and you're the big cog.\" Howe disabuses him: \"We're all in this together, you, me and the rest of us.\" </p> <p>Walking on, he points to a multistorey car park for storing vehicles before they go to dealers. \"Built in the 1960s and ugly: it's got to go. I'm getting rid of it this year. We'll landscape it and open up a vista.\" </p> <p>Mr Howe, who holds a master's degree in business administration, was part of the turnaround team under BMW which left managerial control in British hands - much to the German company's subsequent chagrin after it invested \u00a33bn and lost almost as much. </p> <p>He is \"totally besotted with\" turning the company around. Part of his task is to persuade a sceptical media that Rover has a future as an independent company, and to be more transparent about its finances, production programmes and sales. </p> <p>Back in the Red Room - a refurbished executive dining suite more reminiscent of negotiating tables in communist eastern Europe - he lays a transparency in the overhead projection and tries, unsuccessfully, to manipulate a chart showing the \"profits bridge\", a plan to transform Rover's financial fortunes from the \u00a3840m lost by BMW in 1999 to the small profit pledged for 2002. </p> <p>But the point is clear. Strip out Land Rover's losses of more than \u00a3100m, now Ford's responsibility, and BMW's \u00a3550m one-off losses, and he's well on the way. </p> <p>Take away the share of overheads under BMW that included Oxford, now home to the new Mini, the Gaydon research centre down the M42 and the Warwick headquarters, and bring the entire Rover business under one roof by the summer - and lo, there's a performance gap of around \u00a3100m to be filled by better trading. </p> <p>Mr Howe is adamant that free of BMW's shackles the group will no longer have to perform to a corporate strategy - a \"game\" devised in Munich - but will survive by balancing output and sales. \"We'll only sell cars that make a profit,\" he says, adding that for a limited period he'll sustain a few loss-making sales areas until the new MGs expand the group's overseas presence. </p> <p>For the time being he is stuck with the R25 and R45 models, which have only a few more years life in them, and the new R75 executive car designed under the aegis of BMW. </p> <p>Mr Howe is proud that the R75 production line was transferred from the BMW-owned Oxford plant to Longbridge in just 12 weeks, and that every one of the 600 cars that come off the line each week is already sold. Production is to be doubled by September to meet demand. </p> <p>Last Monday, the first body shells of a dozen prototype R75 estates rolled down the line, a week ahead of schedule. They've been given spot welds by 140 robots - part of a \u00a3400m investment bequeathed by BMW. The gleaming new line, lit by halogen lamps, contrasts starkly with the dark corners of the hall opened in 1980 for the ill-fated Metro, and scene of sullen exchanges between workers and management which often turned into stoppages that brought the UK car industry to its knees. </p> <p><strong> The will to survive</strong><br> </p> <p> In Longbridge the talk is of turnaround, optimism, self-belief, independence; even of hiring new staff. Mr Howe says he's constantly struck by the openness of contact: \"They look you straight in the eye; they want to talk; they're engaged.\" </p> <p>This buoyant mood may prove to be short-lived, and certainly does not reflect the overall ambience of the UK car industry which, faced with yet more global change, is riven with uncertainties and self-doubt. General Motors is adamant it will end Vauxhall production at Luton, and the fate of Nissan's Sunderland plant is still unclear despite EU officials approving \u00a340m of government aid. </p> <p>Mr Howe, who has spent most of his working life in the motor industry, did not expect to be back at the sharp end of all this. His 11 years on the management fast track at Rover covered jobs in systems, planning, logistics and manufacturing. When he left Rover at the end of 1999 to join Rolls-Royce, the aerospace group, as managing director of the fan systems division, he thought he was embarking on a new career. Then came a call from his old boss, former Rover chief executive John Towers, asking whether he would return as chief executive. </p> <p>There was no guarantee that Mr Towers would be in a position to offer him the job. Jon Moulton and his Alchemy venture capital firm were favourites to buy Rover from BMW, and Mr Towers' Phoenix consortium looked like an also ran. </p> <p>But all changed when the Alchemy deal fell through. Rover was losing up to \u00a3840m a year, and BMW could not get rid of it quickly enough. Phoenix bought the business for \u00a310, and collected a \u00a3500m interest free 50-year loan from BMW in the process. </p> <p>Mr Howe is encouraged by newspaper stories about the loan being repayable from group profits. \"At least they think we are going to make profits,\" he says. </p> <p>So, is there a sustained future for MG Rover and the rest of the UK motor industry? Professor Garel Rhys at Cardiff business school says last year's talk of a meltdown was always overblown, and that many of the problems, especially in pre-war plants such as Luton and Dagenham, had been around for years. </p> <p>The key to the future, he adds, is making cars people want to buy - for quality, price and brand value. </p> <p>The public's response to three new MG saloons, derived from the 25, 45 and 75 series and on offer from the summer, will be critical to Rover's success. Mr Howe's five-year business plan envisages trading in the black next year, with 190,000 cars sold this year and over 210,000 in 2002. </p> <p>He is determined to escape the ignominy of 20 years ago, when BL slapped the MG badge on Metros and Maestros, to public disdain. The new MGs will not be derivatives but \"significantly differentiated\", priced from around \u00a310,000 to \u00a335,000 for the \"outrageously performing\" model with a V8 engine producing 300hp. MG, already booked for Le Mans, is also set to enter rallies and tours. </p> <p>But very soon decisions must be made about the design, building and financing of the new medium range car, due to enter production in 2004 after development costs of more than \u00a3250m. </p> <p>It's assumed that Rover is talking to Malaysia's Proton - hardly a byword for brand value - about a collaboration that could lead to a merger or takeover. This assumption is false. Rover would much rather talk to VW or Peugeot, and Mr Howe indicated this week he strongly favoured going it alone by shortening the R75 \"platform\" as the basis for the new car - provided unit costs are kept down. </p> <p>\"By 2004, all our models will be replaced and it will be self-financed,\" he says confidently. His confidence will be tested by the public's response to the new MGs.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The sleepy seaside town of Bridlington, nestled in a sweeping Yorkshire bay between Whitby and Scarborough, is hell bent on becoming the new Brighton, Bournemouth or Blackpool. </p> <p>It has come up with an ambitious \u00a360m regeneration plan to wake from its slumbers and become England's premier conference venue. </p> <p>If the project - spearheaded by East Riding county council - goes ahead, it will be the single largest development of its kind on the east coast of England. </p> <p>Plans include a shimmering new conference centre which could attract thousands of delegates to meet, talk and gaze over the breezy North sea. </p> <p>A 500-berth marina would pull in big-spending boat owners, and new commercial, leisure and residential developments would also help to revive the resort's fortunes. </p> <p>Bridlington is typical of an English seaside town in winter with its closed cafes and vacant, tacky, amusement arcades. A third of the town's population is over 60 - a higher proportion than anywhere else in England. Pensioners shuffle up and down the otherwise empty promenades and the dull drizzle that hangs over the bare beaches creates an overwhelming aura of a place whose best days have long since passed. It is begging for a facelift. </p> <p>The Bridlington regeneration partnership, which is managing the plan, includes local interests ranging from the Royal Yorkshire Yacht Club to the Humber Chamber of Commerce. </p> <p>A total of \u00a314m has been set aside from the council's capital budget, and the remainder of the funds are expected to come from European grants and private sector investment. Plans have been drawn up, business proposals assessed, and the local population consulted. </p> <p>However, the Bridlington Protection Group is challenging the viability of the development, and warns of the negative impact on the make-up of the local community, the marine environment and existing businesses. </p> <p>The group claims a survey conducted on its behalf found only 4.3% of local people in favour of the project. The planned marina development is, it says, out of proportion to the size of the town. New properties would change the face of the harbour, ruin views and destroy the town's character. There is a danger of Bridlington's heritage being lost and preservation being sacrificed in the name of progress. </p> <p>Opponents also fear that the social make-up of the area will be altered as the affluent, upwardly mobile, move in. Property prices will rise and the citizens of Leeds and Bradford, who traditionally retire to \"Brid\", will have to look for their bungalows elsewhere. </p> <p>John Hunter, 29, has lived in the town all his life. The family restaurant he runs has a panoramic view of the stretch of harbour targeted for redevelopment, and he recognises that his business could be changed for ever if the plans go ahead. </p> <p>\"Some local businesses will be affected, including my own, but at some point you have to put your own selfish interests aside in the interests of the town.\" </p> <p>His restaurant is empty but his enthusiasm for the future fills the room. \"I'm all for it. It will bring money in and a lot of investment. So what if the place changes? </p> <p>\"I love it here but that doesn't mean things must always stay the same. It's visitors mainly, and old people who are afraid of change, who are objecting. I just can't see why they are so sceptical. We will be the envy of other resorts if this goes ahead.\" </p> <p>The council claims the development can only be good for the town and that it will be a catalyst for wider regeneration, bringing jobs and increasing property values. </p> <p>Simon Taylor, of the Yorkshire Marina partnership, said: \"There are a small number of people with concerns and we are taking these on board. But this project is about reversing a decline.\" </p> <p>With government approval, the development could be completed by 2004.</p>",

A total of \u00a314m has been set aside from the council's capital budget, and the remainder of the funds are expected to come from European grants and private sector investment. Plans have been drawn up, business proposals assessed, and the local population consulted. However, the Bridlington Protection Group is challenging the viability of the development, and warns of the negative impact on the make-up of the local community, the marine environment and existing businesses. The group claims a survey conducted on its behalf found only 4.3% of local people in favour of the project. The planned marina development is, it says, out of proportion to the size of the town. New properties would change the face of the harbour, ruin views and destroy the town's character. There is a danger of Bridlington's heritage being lost and preservation being sacrificed in the name of progress. Opponents also fear that the social make-up of the area will be altered as the affluent, upwardly mobile, move in. Property prices will rise and the citizens of Leeds and Bradford, who traditionally retire to \"Brid\", will have to look for their bungalows elsewhere. John Hunter, 29, has lived in the town all his life. The family restaurant he runs has a panoramic view of the stretch of harbour targeted for redevelopment, and he recognises that his business could be changed for ever if the plans go ahead. \"Some local businesses will be affected, including my own, but at some point you have to put your own selfish interests aside in the interests of the town.\" His restaurant is empty but his enthusiasm for the future fills the room. \"I'm all for it. It will bring money in and a lot of investment. So what if the place changes? \"I love it here but that doesn't mean things must always stay the same. It's visitors mainly, and old people who are afraid of change, who are objecting. I just can't see why they are so sceptical. We will be the envy of other resorts if this goes ahead.\" The council claims the development can only be good for the town and that it will be a catalyst for wider regeneration, bringing jobs and increasing property values. Simon Taylor, of the Yorkshire Marina partnership, said: \"There are a small number of people with concerns and we are taking these on board. But this project is about reversing a decline.\" With government approval, the development could be completed by 2004.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Late Victorian Holocausts: El Nino Famines and the Making of the Third World</strong> </p> <p> Mike Davis </p> <p>464pp, Verso, \u00a320 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502370171,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a><br></p> <p> Recording the past can be a tricky business for historians. Prophesying the future is even more hazardous. In 1901, shortly before the death of Queen Victoria, the radical writer William Digby looked back to the 1876 Madras famine and confidently asserted: \"When the part played by the British Empire in the 19th century is regarded by the historian 50 years hence, the unnecessary deaths of millions of Indians would be its principal and most notorious monument.\" Who now remembers the Madrasis? </p> <p>In Late Victorian Holocausts, Mike Davis charts the unprecedented human suffering caused by a series of extreme climactic conditions in the final quarter of the 19th century. Drought and monsoons afflicted much of China, southern Africa, Brazil, Egypt and India. The death tolls were staggering: around 12m Chinese and over 6m Indians in 1876-1878 alone. The chief culprit, according to Davis, was not the weather, but European empires, with Japan and the US. Their imposition of free-market economics on the colonial world was tantamount to a \"cultural genocide\". </p> <p>These are strong words. Yet it's hard to disagree with them after reading Davis's harrowing book. Development economists have long argued that drought need not lead to famine; well-stocked inventories and effective distribution can limit the damage. In the 19th century, however, drought was treated, particularly by the English in India, as an opportunity for reasserting sovereignty. </p> <p>A particular villain was Lord Lytton, son of the Victorian novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton (\"It was a dark and stormy night...\") after whom, today, a well-known bad writing prize is named. During 1876 Lytton, widely suspected to be insane, ignored all efforts to alleviate the suffering of millions of peasants in the Madras region and concentrated on preparing for Queen Victoria's investiture as Empress of India.

Prophesying the future is even more hazardous. In 1901, shortly before the death of Queen Victoria, the radical writer William Digby looked back to the 1876 Madras famine and confidently asserted: \"When the part played by the British Empire in the 19th century is regarded by the historian 50 years hence, the unnecessary deaths of millions of Indians would be its principal and most notorious monument.\" Who now remembers the Madrasis? In Late Victorian Holocausts, Mike Davis charts the unprecedented human suffering caused by a series of extreme climactic conditions in the final quarter of the 19th century. Drought and monsoons afflicted much of China, southern Africa, Brazil, Egypt and India. The death tolls were staggering: around 12m Chinese and over 6m Indians in 1876-1878 alone. The chief culprit, according to Davis, was not the weather, but European empires, with Japan and the US. Their imposition of free-market economics on the colonial world was tantamount to a \"cultural genocide\". These are strong words. Yet it's hard to disagree with them after reading Davis's harrowing book. Development economists have long argued that drought need not lead to famine; well-stocked inventories and effective distribution can limit the damage. In the 19th century, however, drought was treated, particularly by the English in India, as an opportunity for reasserting sovereignty. A particular villain was Lord Lytton, son of the Victorian novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton (\"It was a dark and stormy night...\") after whom, today, a well-known bad writing prize is named. During 1876 Lytton, widely suspected to be insane, ignored all efforts to alleviate the suffering of millions of peasants in the Madras region and concentrated on preparing for Queen Victoria's investiture as Empress of India. The highlight of the celebrations was a week-long feast of lucullan excess at which 68,000 dignitaries heard her promise the nation \"happiness, prosperity and welfare\". Lytton believed in free trade. He did nothing to check the huge hikes in grain prices, Economic \"modernization\" led household and village reserves to be transferred to central depots using recently built railroads. Much was exported to England, where there had been poor harvests. Telegraph technology allowed prices to be centrally co-ordinated and, inevitably, raised in thousands of small towns. Relief funds were scanty because Lytton was eager to finance military campaigns in Afghanistan. Conditions in emergency camps were so terrible that some peasants preferred to go to jail.

      "bodyText": "The cafe chatter in Wellington may be dominated by talk of the new film version of JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, but New Zealanders are feeling a more tangible benefit from the shooting of the epic fantasy trilogy - a boost to their economy. The three films - The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King - were shot back to back over 15 months in locations around New Zealand, one of the biggest ever projects of its type. Principal shooting finished in late December but by the time post-production work on special effects for the last film is finished in 2003, New Line Cinema will have spent an estimated \u00a3300m on the trilogy. That has translated into an economic boom for Wellington, a city of only 150,000 inhabitants. While property prices in New Zealand as a whole have declined by up to 12% in the last few years, the cost of property around Wellington has gone up by about the same margin. In parts of Miramar, the tranquil suburb of tearooms and sea views where Mr Jackson works, rents have quadrupled. And apart from the 300-strong crew and the 15,000 extras who will appear on screen alongside stars such as Elijah Wood (Frodo), Ian McKellen (Gandalf), Ian Holm (Bilbo Baggins) and Liv Tyler (Arwen), more than 7,000 new jobs have been created in the New Zealand film industry in the last year. New Zealand was chosen for location shooting because of the beauty of its landscape and because it is the home of the director, Peter Jackson, 39, previously best known for directing Kate Winslet's first film, Heavenly Creatures. \"It has taken 45 years for film-making technology to fi nally catch up with Tolkien's imagination,\" he said. \"We are fortunate down here to have both the computer technology and the natural landscape to bring the unique world of Middle Earth to life.\" The project has come as sweet relief to a domestic film business whose highly limited output to date has been described as adventurously low-budget or, alternatively, direly underfinanced. The New Zealand Screen Producers and Directors Association has predicted that, on the strength of the ongoing work associated with The Lord of the Rings and other productions, national revenues from film production could again top NZ$1bn (\u00a3300m) next year. Mr Jackson's custom-built studio, WETA, will create some 1,200 computer-generated and model shots for the films at a fraction of the cost that Hollywood special effects houses charge. While companies such as George Lucas's Industrial Light &amp; Magic sometimes charge up to \u00a367,000 per special effects shot, Mr Jackson's studio can sever a goblin's head or conjure a jabbering hobbit for as little as \u00a35,500. Wellington's mayor, Mark Blumsky, plans to lead a contingent of New Zealand businessmen and film industry bosses to the US next month to promote his city as \"the home of The Lord of the Rings\". He said that he hopes to persuade New Line Cinema to hold at least one of its world premieres for the trilogy in the New Zealand capital. The first installment of the completed trilogy, The Fellowship of the Ring, is scheduled for British release next December, although teaser trailers have already been shown. Mr Jackson promises that the work will be crafted for British audiences \"with honour. I do want to make the kind of movie that Tolkien would have enjoyed. \"But to do it with integrity, for me, means making a Peter Jackson movie, my own very personal version of a passionate, classic British work.\" For the citizens of Wellington, though, the financial benefits have already been felt.",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of protesters marched to the presidential palace in Manila in the early hours of this morning after the collapse of the government of President Joseph Estrada in the Philippines. Television reported that police fired warning shots near the palace to keep protesters away and to make sure demonstrators did not clash with a small number of Estrada supporters. The powerful Roman Catholic church in the Philippines had earlier announced that it would swear in the vice-president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, as the country's new president by midday local time today (4am British time), although it was later reported that the ceremony might be put back. The opposition had set noon as the new deadline for the resignation of Mr Estrada after he ignored an earlier deadline. According to an Estrada adviser, the president was still at the palace and wanted to stay in the Philippines. Ms Arroyo has already declared herself commander in chief of the army. Mr Estrada's government had been besieged by a people power movement utilising modern technology and voicing outrage at the former movie star's blatant attempts to sabotage his impeachment trial. Millions of ordinary Filipinos, communicating with each other via mobile phone text messages, swarmed on to the streets of the capital, Manila, in scenes reminiscent of the 1986 uprising which ousted the former dictator Ferdinand Marcos. The country's most senior generals and most of the cabinet deserted their beleaguered leader as more than 250,000 people demonstrated. Most people heard about the planned swearing-in of Ms Arroyo via the text messages, the same means that galvanised a spontaneous uprising on Tuesday evening, when Mr Estrada's impeachment trial collapsed after he bullied and bribed senators to block the admission of vital evidence. Within minutes \"Trial collapsed\" was whizzing round the phone networks, followed by messages abusing the senators as \"elements of evil\". All the messages ended with the same three words: \"Pass this on.\" Then the first genesis of a protest movement emerged: \"Be angry _ Come outside at 11 [pm] and make noise.\" \"Come to EDSA\" hit people's screens, referring to the shrine built on the site of the 1986 demonstrations. \"Wear black because we're mourning the death of truth and justice,\" was the next command. \"No one knew where these messages originated,\" said Narzalina Lim, a civil society leader and minister under former president Corazon Acquino, who replaced Marcos in 1986. \"They just appeared and within an hour or two tens of thousands of people had gathered. It really was people power in action as there was no obvious leader to make the calls.\" The tone of the messages changed on Wednesday as people feared retaliation and retribution from Mr Estrada and his cronies. Bomb scares, fake assassination attempts and warnings about coups were the most common alarms. By yesterday the crowd at the shrine had swollen to more than a quarter of a million, while the pro-Estrada rally numbered about 3,000. The first development yesterday was news that several thousand pro-Estrada supporters had descended on the business district and had clashed briefly with anti-Estrada office workers there. The impeachment affair, which broke last October when a provincial governor, Luis Singson, went public with accusations that Mr Estrada had siphoned off millions of pounds from illegal gambling scams, almost brought the economy to its knees. On the news that the government had collapsed, the Philippine currency rallied from almost 56 pesos to the US dollar to almost 47. Then came news that the country's military chief, General Angelo Reyes, had withdrawn his support for Mr Estrada, followed by a slew of other generals, police chiefs and ministers. Only a tiny hardcore of fanatical loyalists remained at the president's side. The text message doing the rounds late last night said it all: \"I guess we've won again.\"",

With a reputation as a professional soldier rather than a political yes-man, Gen Reyes wanted to avoid violence at all costs.

      "body": "<p>I've been trying for ages to put my finger on the difference between the French and British film worlds, and now I think I've got it. The difference is that, over there, the stars turn up to the works disco. This week, the French cinema industry threw a closing-night party for a delegation of visiting foreign buyers and journalists in a no-frills disco off the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Nothing remotely flashy - just assorted distributors, hacks and movie business office workers making the most of the free drinks. But, look - isn't that Sophie Marceau on the dance floor, just north of Sergi Lopez? And, over there, Emmanuelle B\u00e9art? And not a press photographer to be seen. In London, of course, anyone who ever turned up halfway down the EastEnders cast list is unlikely to grace an event unless there's a guaranteed full contingent from the OK! photo desk. </p> <p>For the past three years, Unifrance, a body that promotes French cinema abroad, has been organising an annual \"European rendezvous\" - a big junket at which foreign delegates can watch new films and journalists can bag a few interviews. My own film-nerd instinct on arrival is to scan the pages of listings mag Pariscope and the fabulously unpronounceable arts weekly Les Inrockuptibles to see what's new on release. As always, there's at least one French comedy with an unfeasibly unwieldy title - this season's is People Who Wear Swimming Suits Are Not (Necessarily) Superficial (love those brackets). </p> <p>There's also usually an event film the critics love to hate. This season, it's the first feature in eight years by Jean-Jacques Beineix, director of Diva and Betty Blue. Mortel Transfert (Deadly Transference) is a deliriously convoluted psychoanalytical thriller about a shrink (the perennially droopy Jean-Hugues Anglade), who nods off in a session with a femme fatale patient and wakes to find her strangled. The film is an expensively ghoulish goulash of flashy interiors, necrophilia, S&amp;M and slapstick, with the odd Lacan reference thrown in. It's dreadful, but compulsively watchable, and you won't be missing much if it never comes here. </p> <p>Most of the screenings Unifrance has on offer are commercial rather than art-house fare. An unidentified French filmgoer is quoted in Variety this week as saying that French films are more intelligent, \"except those with G\u00e9rard Depardieu\", and Le Placard (The Closet), this week's big opener, bears that out. It's directed by mainstream comedy stalwart Francis Veber (Le Dner de Cons), and the appropriate response is: shrug, bof!, harmless if you like that sort of thing. Daniel Auteuil plays a shy accountant who pretends to be gay to keep his job. Depardieu, on amiable good-sport form, is his macho personnel manager. It's a well-intentioned, old-fashioned, drab film that only works if you imagine a world in which no one had ever met a gay man before, or your idea of comedy is a poker-faced Auteuil wearing an outsize condom on his head. </p> <p>Then there's the debut feature by British TV's favourite professional Frenchman, Antoine de Caunes. Les Morsures de l'Aube (Love Bites) is a would-be hip vampire thriller about a satanic brother-sister duo who haunt the Paris club scene. It's slick, dated Goth tack. Eurotrash indeed. But it boasts what may prove the strangest dialogue-bite of the year, in a sex scene featuring hyper-trendy vamp Asia Argento: \"I won't take my bra off, as I have huge breasts. But perhaps you recognise it - it's an exact replica of the one worn by Janet Leigh in Psycho.\" </p> <p>But the real knockout was La Ville Est Tranquille by Marseilles-based Robert Gu\u00e9diguian, who made A la Place du Coeur. A hit in Venice last year, it's an ensemble piece - rather like Magnolia in a hard realist vein. Its main characters are a docker-turned-taxi driver and a middle-aged woman trying to keep her junkie daughter alive. It has the smack of reality, you might say, with brilliant performances by the director's usual rep players, including Ariane Ascaride. Sometimes the arguments about the downfall of the labour movement are a little on-the-nose, but Gu\u00e9diguian spins his tragedy with a grace and complexity that finally leave you shaking. And so, to quote a leading French vampirologist: \"Allez, salut maintenant.\"</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Does Steven Soderbergh have a crystal ball or is he just uncannily prescient? No sooner did his new film Traffic, about the pointlessness of America's increasingly costly war on drugs, set on the Mexican border, open in Los Angeles than California voters approved new legislation permitting the medicinal use of marijuana and allowing non-violent drug offenders to opt for treatment over punitive prison sentences. </p> <p>The next thing you know, the Supreme Court gifted the presidency to Bush - a candidate who had spent much of his campaign fudging the question of whether or not he \"inhaled\" cocaine in the early 70s during what his father's former chief-of-staff infamously referred to as Dubya's \"lost weekends in Mexico\". </p> <p>Finally, in another example of life imitating art (or is it the other way round?), two weeks ago Clinton's outgoing drug tsar General Barry McCaffrey began a round of interviews in which he expressed sentiments not a million miles away from those uttered by judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) in his resignation speech at the end of Traffic.</p> <p>No wonder Soderbergh's film, already nominated for multiple Golden Globes and a best director Oscar contender, has been hailed by American critics as the most \"timely\" and \"resonant\" film of the year. In an industry that usually comes down on the side of Nancy Reagan and \"just say no\", Traffic cuts through the vacuous political rhetoric surrounding drugs and dares to say \"just say know\". </p> <p>The trouble is, that's all it says. Just when you think Douglas - the veils removed from his eyes by the discovery that his Mexican counterpart is working for the cartels and that his daughter is a crack addict - is going to tell it like it is, Soderbergh and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan duck the issue, leaving the audience, in the words of Time's critic, \"feeling restless and dissatisfied\". </p> <p>Indeed, the irony is that in recent interviews Clinton's real-life drug tsar has gone much further than Douglas - for all his recent pot-smoking in Wonderboys - is allowed to in Traffic. While Douglas slopes off at the end of Soderbergh's film muttering \"I don't know how you wage war on your own family\", McCaffrey, who refuses to use the phrase \"war on drugs\", has come up with concrete proposals, including the repeal of New York's mandatory prison sentences for drug offences and more federal funds for treatment. </p> <p>Meanwhile, now he's a lame duck, Clinton has been making similarly progressive noises in an interview with Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone. Too little, too late, cry critics like the Lindesmith Center, the drugs policy reform foundation set up by the financier George Soros and Progessive Corporation's Peter Lewis. The Clinton administration, they point out, spent $19bn last year on drug interdiction - more than six times what it spent on treatment - and that's not including the $1.3bn Clinton has just pledged to Colombia to stamp out its cocaine trade.</p> <p>In the best sequences of Traffic - the yellow-tinted sections set in Tijuana following Benicio Del Toro's bear-like cop as he is drawn ever closer to the heart of the corruption - Soderbergh's film at least shows how futile the outgoing administration's Colombian strategy is likely to be. The mystery is why he didn't take the argument further and turn the camera, for instance, on the widespread drug abuse in his own industry. </p> <p>When he optioned Simon Moore's C4 series, Traffik, in which multiple storylines tracked drug dealers from Pakistan to Great Britain, Soderbergh said his goal was to recreate the same documentary feel and not to \"come off like we had the answers.\" Unfortunately, in his concern to be even-handed and, presumably, to keep in Oscar contention too, Soderbergh ends up censoring himself. The result is a film that appears to be all things to all people. </p> <p>After a special screening in Washington for Drug Enforcement Administration officials, for instance, Soderbergh was congratulated for making a pro-law enforcement movie. Meanwhile, his hip liberal friends think he's turned in an ode to legalisation. As he told the Village Voice: \"The funny thing is, everybody who sees it thinks it puts their point of view across.\" Duh. Isn't that what he intended?</p> <p>At least there is no confusing where Darren Aronofsky is coming from in Requiem For A Dream. Adapted from the book by Hubert Selby Jr with Selby's help, Requiem looks the way drug movies used to look: all urban angst and whizzed-up junkies. Like Panic In Needle Park, Drugstore Cowboy and even Boogie Nights - set in the porn industry but as much to do with cocaine abuse - it starts on a high and ends on a cautionary low. Indeed, so graphic are Aronofsky's rapid-edit images of Harry (Jared Leto) and his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) shooting up, you almost get high watching them - the camera takes you literally inside the syringe and then puts you eyeball-to-eyeball with the couple's dilating pupils. </p> <p>But it would be a mistake to see Requiem simply as another in a long line of gritty drug movies. Despite the inevitable, unhappy ending, Requiem is no Christiane F.

      "bodyText": "Does Steven Soderbergh have a crystal ball or is he just uncannily prescient? No sooner did his new film Traffic, about the pointlessness of America's increasingly costly war on drugs, set on the Mexican border, open in Los Angeles than California voters approved new legislation permitting the medicinal use of marijuana and allowing non-violent drug offenders to opt for treatment over punitive prison sentences. The next thing you know, the Supreme Court gifted the presidency to Bush - a candidate who had spent much of his campaign fudging the question of whether or not he \"inhaled\" cocaine in the early 70s during what his father's former chief-of-staff infamously referred to as Dubya's \"lost weekends in Mexico\". Finally, in another example of life imitating art (or is it the other way round?), two weeks ago Clinton's outgoing drug tsar General Barry McCaffrey began a round of interviews in which he expressed sentiments not a million miles away from those uttered by judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) in his resignation speech at the end of Traffic. No wonder Soderbergh's film, already nominated for multiple Golden Globes and a best director Oscar contender, has been hailed by American critics as the most \"timely\" and \"resonant\" film of the year. In an industry that usually comes down on the side of Nancy Reagan and \"just say no\", Traffic cuts through the vacuous political rhetoric surrounding drugs and dares to say \"just say know\". The trouble is, that's all it says. Just when you think Douglas - the veils removed from his eyes by the discovery that his Mexican counterpart is working for the cartels and that his daughter is a crack addict - is going to tell it like it is, Soderbergh and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan duck the issue, leaving the audience, in the words of Time's critic, \"feeling restless and dissatisfied\". Indeed, the irony is that in recent interviews Clinton's real-life drug tsar has gone much further than Douglas - for all his recent pot-smoking in Wonderboys - is allowed to in Traffic. While Douglas slopes off at the end of Soderbergh's film muttering \"I don't know how you wage war on your own family\", McCaffrey, who refuses to use the phrase \"war on drugs\", has come up with concrete proposals, including the repeal of New York's mandatory prison sentences for drug offences and more federal funds for treatment. Meanwhile, now he's a lame duck, Clinton has been making similarly progressive noises in an interview with Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone. Too little, too late, cry critics like the Lindesmith Center, the drugs policy reform foundation set up by the financier George Soros and Progessive Corporation's Peter Lewis. The Clinton administration, they point out, spent $19bn last year on drug interdiction - more than six times what it spent on treatment - and that's not including the $1.3bn Clinton has just pledged to Colombia to stamp out its cocaine trade. In the best sequences of Traffic - the yellow-tinted sections set in Tijuana following Benicio Del Toro's bear-like cop as he is drawn ever closer to the heart of the corruption - Soderbergh's film at least shows how futile the outgoing administration's Colombian strategy is likely to be. The mystery is why he didn't take the argument further and turn the camera, for instance, on the widespread drug abuse in his own industry. When he optioned Simon Moore's C4 series, Traffik, in which multiple storylines tracked drug dealers from Pakistan to Great Britain, Soderbergh said his goal was to recreate the same documentary feel and not to \"come off like we had the answers.\" Unfortunately, in his concern to be even-handed and, presumably, to keep in Oscar contention too, Soderbergh ends up censoring himself. The result is a film that appears to be all things to all people. After a special screening in Washington for Drug Enforcement Administration officials, for instance, Soderbergh was congratulated for making a pro-law enforcement movie. Meanwhile, his hip liberal friends think he's turned in an ode to legalisation. As he told the Village Voice: \"The funny thing is, everybody who sees it thinks it puts their point of view across.\" Duh. Isn't that what he intended? At least there is no confusing where Darren Aronofsky is coming from in Requiem For A Dream. Adapted from the book by Hubert Selby Jr with Selby's help, Requiem looks the way drug movies used to look: all urban angst and whizzed-up junkies. Like Panic In Needle Park, Drugstore Cowboy and even Boogie Nights - set in the porn industry but as much to do with cocaine abuse - it starts on a high and ends on a cautionary low. Indeed, so graphic are Aronofsky's rapid-edit images of Harry (Jared Leto) and his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) shooting up, you almost get high watching them - the camera takes you literally inside the syringe and then puts you eyeball-to-eyeball with the couple's dilating pupils. But it would be a mistake to see Requiem simply as another in a long line of gritty drug movies. Despite the inevitable, unhappy ending, Requiem is no Christiane F. Uli Edel's 1981 portrait of the decline of a young Berlin heroin addict was the film equivalent of lithium; Requiem, in contrast, is as much about the double standards of our postmodern drug-phobic society as it is about addiction and, unlike Traffic, Aronofsky's message is absolutely clear.

Perhaps your colleague took a gap year out to travel in the US and welcomed the challenges of living in an unfamiliar culture. You, on the other hand, might be a graduate who has never travelled outside Europe. You might very well like America, but chances are another location would be a better option for you. </p> <p>The decision to study abroad requires some serious self- examination. If you know why you want to study abroad, why you're at a certain school and why you've chosen a certain lifestyle, you'll be much better prepared when the going gets a little bumpy. Why do you want to study abroad? Without answers to these question, finding the right programme will be a hit-or-miss affair. </p> <p> William H Cox, in his Guide to the Best European Business Schools, (McGraw Hill) outlines some of the main differences between US and European MBA programmes. European programmes, he says, have a more international student body and teaching faculty than US programmes. European schools still lack the historically-rooted and accepted accreditation norm that exists in the United States, but because they are less developed, can also afford to be more dynamic, often employing a greater diversity and originality of teaching and learning methods. </p> <p>On a more practical level, the courses at European business schools tend to be shorter-ranging from one to one-and-a-half years compared with the standard two-year courses run by most US schools. European MBA students also tend to be slightly older than their US counterparts. Ten or 20 years ago, US students tended to take MBAs in their early twenties; now the average age in the US is 26, compared with an average age of 27 in Europe. </p> <p>European students, therefore, begin MBAs with greater work experience, and to take two years out of a career in order to study may be a good deal less practicable than choosing a one-year course. Critics of shorter courses say a year is not always sufficient to digest the volume of work covered; graduates of two-year MBA courses also tend to have higher starting salaries than those from one-year courses. </p> <p> If you are thinking of France, you are in good company. Business schools in France have long been a mecca for aspiring European managers. French companies are employing increasing numbers of foreigners in senior management as they try to internationalise their management ranks. </p> <p>In France, the MBA student body is drawn from a very diverse and talented group of professionals which span a wide range of ages, disciplines, and cultures. </p> <p>If you want to pursue an MBA course in France, there are several English-speaking programmes which aim to fold French culture into a multicultural environment. </p> <p>France's most famous school, Fontainbleau-based INSEAD, has grown from a modest European educational institute to one of the world's most internationally-renowned business schools and more than 650 MBA graduates, 5,500 executives and 40 PhD students from more than 75 countries passthrough it each year. </p> <p>These participants are taught by a faculty of 124 professors from 26 countries. The institute's extensive alumni network, which includes Conservative leader William Hague, is present in 122 countries. </p> <p> INSEAD, which was the first business school to offer a one-year MBA, continues to expand. For example it recently opened an Asian campus in Singapore. Its \"one school, two campuses\" concept allows participants to study in Europe, Asia or both. \"The emphasis at Insead is on gaining leading-edge knowledge that can be put to use immediately for competitive advantage,\" says Yves Doz, associate dean and professor of global technology and innovation. </p> <p>Lausanne-based IMD in Switzerland is more industry- focused. Every year, more than 4,000 executives from around 70 countries attend one of the IMD executive programs. Some 130 of the world's leading companies, maintain close business links with IMD through participation in its 'learning network'. </p> <p>IMD's MBA graduates benefit from classroom-based learning and opportunities to meet with the school's business partners throughout the year. </p> <p>The Belgian Vlerick Leuven Ghent Management School targets younger managers from different cultural, academic and professional backgrounds. </p> <p>Significantly, the Belgium government subsidies the typical </p> <p>\u00a320,000 course fees by up to 75%, leaving the individual student to find around \u00a35,000. </p> <p>The financial support makes MBAs at the school at a very affordable proposition. For example, Paddy Creedon, a Dublin-based businessman running his own firm, has enrolled on the part-time MBA at Vlerick Leuven Ghent.

Getting accreditation is neither easy nor quick. A business school starting to teach MBAs cannot apply until the MBA programme has run for three years. When it does apply, there is first an informal visit, probably from the association's accreditation manager, before the school makes a written submission. Once over that hurdle, the school is visited by (usually) a five-strong team of senior academics. The curriculum, faculty, teaching methods, assessment procedures, the standing and finances of the business school are all inspected, as are the students. Are the entry criteria for students high enough?

      "body": "<p>Sometimes what you hear about MBAs can sound more like the back-of-a- lamp post adverts from the other end of the employment market. But what is really known about the sort of salaries that MBA graduates can command? </p> <p>According to the Financial Times ranking of the top 75 full-time international MBA courses, alumni of the highest place UK institution (London Business School) can expect salary increases of 146%, with alumni of the other nine UK schools on the list receiving an average rise of 95% in the three years since graduating in 1996. </p> <p>The FT's figures are the most comprehensive available, but it should be remembered they have been converted into dollars to facilitate comparison with US schools and then adjusted to take into account salary variation between sectors. The figures are also, of course, a snapshot of only the very top of the market. </p> <p>The second set of figures available is from the Association of MBAs (AMBA). According to its report for 1999-2000, which is based on a sample of alumni from UK and non-UK schools, salaries rise by 40% on average at graduation. </p> <p>This figure drops to 25% when adjusted for wage inflation, but it remains impressive given that it is based on salary levels immediately after completion of the course. </p> <p>Finally, there are figures available from organisations such as MBA Direct, an executive recruitment service which holds details on alumni from leading business schools. Statistics from this source show that a UK-based MBA can expect a more realistic 36% salary rise on graduating. </p> <p>\"Figures like these are extremely difficult to come by,\" says Rod Younger, a Cranfield MBA graduate, and the founder and chief executive of MBA Direct, \"and not many organisations hold data across all sectors and internationally as we do. Our data is actually a by-product of our service rather than something that has been produced for report or ranking purposes, so it may therefore have greater validity.\" </p> <p>Younger highlights one of the most important difficulties with obtaining reliable information about MBA salaries. As a category, they are almost by definition generalists, so transcending sector and industry salary surveys. </p> <p>Secondly, although there are a lot of them (the current estimate is more than 50,000 with 9,000 new MBA graduates leaving business schools each year), no single organisation oversees the whole sector. AMBA only accredits 35 of the 118 institutions offering MBAs in the UK (although its figures do account for 65% of all UK graduates). </p> <p>The third difficulty is that the people who respond to questionnaires, whether from the FT or AMBA, are of necessity self- selecting, and while both organisations have a response rate of more than 1 in 5, MBA graduates have a vested interest in talking up themselves and their schools. </p> <p>These caveats aside, what information is there available on actual salaries? AMBA's figures show that the average salary an MBA graduate can currently command is now \u00a363,950 (this is the mean figure - the median is \u00a350,000). </p> <p>This figure should be fairly robust given that it is based on a sample of more than 1,300 graduates, and it compares well with the average extrapolated from MBA Direct's statistics which are in the range between \u00a350,000 and \u00a365,000. (Unfortunately, although MBA Direct's sample size is similar, its figures have been converted into euros making direct comparisons difficult.) </p> <p>When it comes to looking at salaries by sector, only MBA graduates working in finance can expect mean salaries of more than \u00a380,000. Graduates working in telecommunications and consulting should expect more than \u00a370,000, while those in energy and IT can command salaries of more than \u00a360,000. All other sectors show a base salary of between \u00a350,000 and \u00a360,000, except for public services and education, where the figures are \u00a340,100 and \u00a336,600 respectively. </p> <p>All these averages are from AMBA's report, but unfortunately, because of differences in sector definition, only a handful of them can be compared with figures supplied by MBA Direct. Those that are comparable do fall within the broad range of salaries indicated by MBA Direct's statistics except in two areas: consulting and telecommunications. </p> <p>In these sectors, MBA Direct's data suggests salaries should be at the top end of the \u00a350,000 to \u00a365,000 range. </p> <p>Other points to note from AMBA's report, which may be of interest to prospective MBA students, include the fact that the highest percentage increase in salary on graduation goes to those who have done a two-year full-time qualification (67% when adjusted for salary inflation). </p> <p>One year courses are the next most profitable (at 30%), while modular, part-time and distance learning bring up the rear (all around 20%). Prospective MBA students should also note, as should their bosses, that the increases in salary for those who changed employer were also particularly high. </p> <p> Don't expect it to transform you, says Sara Hadlow, a 34-year old MBA graduate of Aston Business School who now works as commercial strategy manager for Brintons Carpets. \"An MBA is a tool through which to learn. It is hard work and applying the knowledge that gets you where you want to go. </p> <p>\"From a base in manufacturing, I took a fairly conventional route from product management through to marketing. But by my late 20s I felt my career was beginning to stall. I wasn't moving towards strategic management, and I realised that an MBA was the only springboard that would get me where I wanted to go. </p> <p>\"I decided to do it full-time because I wanted to change the way I thought, rather than being side-tracked by one organisation's issues. With a mortgage and without sponsorship, it was a high-risk strategy, but it turned out to be the best career investment I have ever made. </p> <p>\"The goals I had when I started the course have easily been exceeded. My salary has increased by 95% over the last four years; I have moved from marketing to strategic management, and it has transformed the way I think. I would temper all that by saying that when you finish the MBA the course is only half-way through. There will still be a lot to learn about putting the theory into practice.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sometimes what you hear about MBAs can sound more like the back-of-a- lamp post adverts from the other end of the employment market. But what is really known about the sort of salaries that MBA graduates can command? According to the Financial Times ranking of the top 75 full-time international MBA courses, alumni of the highest place UK institution (London Business School) can expect salary increases of 146%, with alumni of the other nine UK schools on the list receiving an average rise of 95% in the three years since graduating in 1996. The FT's figures are the most comprehensive available, but it should be remembered they have been converted into dollars to facilitate comparison with US schools and then adjusted to take into account salary variation between sectors. The figures are also, of course, a snapshot of only the very top of the market. The second set of figures available is from the Association of MBAs (AMBA). According to its report for 1999-2000, which is based on a sample of alumni from UK and non-UK schools, salaries rise by 40% on average at graduation. This figure drops to 25% when adjusted for wage inflation, but it remains impressive given that it is based on salary levels immediately after completion of the course. Finally, there are figures available from organisations such as MBA Direct, an executive recruitment service which holds details on alumni from leading business schools. Statistics from this source show that a UK-based MBA can expect a more realistic 36% salary rise on graduating. \"Figures like these are extremely difficult to come by,\" says Rod Younger, a Cranfield MBA graduate, and the founder and chief executive of MBA Direct, \"and not many organisations hold data across all sectors and internationally as we do. Our data is actually a by-product of our service rather than something that has been produced for report or ranking purposes, so it may therefore have greater validity.\" Younger highlights one of the most important difficulties with obtaining reliable information about MBA salaries. As a category, they are almost by definition generalists, so transcending sector and industry salary surveys. Secondly, although there are a lot of them (the current estimate is more than 50,000 with 9,000 new MBA graduates leaving business schools each year), no single organisation oversees the whole sector. AMBA only accredits 35 of the 118 institutions offering MBAs in the UK (although its figures do account for 65% of all UK graduates). The third difficulty is that the people who respond to questionnaires, whether from the FT or AMBA, are of necessity self- selecting, and while both organisations have a response rate of more than 1 in 5, MBA graduates have a vested interest in talking up themselves and their schools. These caveats aside, what information is there available on actual salaries? AMBA's figures show that the average salary an MBA graduate can currently command is now \u00a363,950 (this is the mean figure - the median is \u00a350,000). This figure should be fairly robust given that it is based on a sample of more than 1,300 graduates, and it compares well with the average extrapolated from MBA Direct's statistics which are in the range between \u00a350,000 and \u00a365,000. (Unfortunately, although MBA Direct's sample size is similar, its figures have been converted into euros making direct comparisons difficult.) When it comes to looking at salaries by sector, only MBA graduates working in finance can expect mean salaries of more than \u00a380,000. Graduates working in telecommunications and consulting should expect more than \u00a370,000, while those in energy and IT can command salaries of more than \u00a360,000. All other sectors show a base salary of between \u00a350,000 and \u00a360,000, except for public services and education, where the figures are \u00a340,100 and \u00a336,600 respectively. All these averages are from AMBA's report, but unfortunately, because of differences in sector definition, only a handful of them can be compared with figures supplied by MBA Direct. Those that are comparable do fall within the broad range of salaries indicated by MBA Direct's statistics except in two areas: consulting and telecommunications. In these sectors, MBA Direct's data suggests salaries should be at the top end of the \u00a350,000 to \u00a365,000 range. Other points to note from AMBA's report, which may be of interest to prospective MBA students, include the fact that the highest percentage increase in salary on graduation goes to those who have done a two-year full-time qualification (67% when adjusted for salary inflation). One year courses are the next most profitable (at 30%), while modular, part-time and distance learning bring up the rear (all around 20%). Prospective MBA students should also note, as should their bosses, that the increases in salary for those who changed employer were also particularly high. Don't expect it to transform you, says Sara Hadlow, a 34-year old MBA graduate of Aston Business School who now works as commercial strategy manager for Brintons Carpets. \"An MBA is a tool through which to learn. It is hard work and applying the knowledge that gets you where you want to go. \"From a base in manufacturing, I took a fairly conventional route from product management through to marketing. But by my late 20s I felt my career was beginning to stall. I wasn't moving towards strategic management, and I realised that an MBA was the only springboard that would get me where I wanted to go. \"I decided to do it full-time because I wanted to change the way I thought, rather than being side-tracked by one organisation's issues. With a mortgage and without sponsorship, it was a high-risk strategy, but it turned out to be the best career investment I have ever made. \"The goals I had when I started the course have easily been exceeded. My salary has increased by 95% over the last four years; I have moved from marketing to strategic management, and it has transformed the way I think. I would temper all that by saying that when you finish the MBA the course is only half-way through. There will still be a lot to learn about putting the theory into practice.\"",

Even if 10,000 fans committed to spend \u00a310 a month each on shares it would take them more than 47 years to reach their target.</p> <p>The real significance of the scheme is that it is being launched with the blessing of the club and is an indication of how relations between the United board and rebel fan groups are improving.</p> <p>The chief executive Peter Kenyon has been keen to build bridges with supporters since taking over from the unpopular Martin Edwards in the autumn. Shareholders United (SU) has been awarded a place in United's new Supporters' Consultative Forum and Kenyon has committed to meeting supporters regularly.</p> <p>A \u00a310,000 cheque, which SU hopes will be the first of regular monthly payments, will be presented to United's stockbrokers Wise Speak before today's home game against Aston Villa. The money will be spent on shares and held in a special account by Wise Speak.</p> <p>Fans will be charged \u00a310 to join the scheme and automatically become shareholders, gaining a say in how the club are run.</p>",

Shareholders United, a pressure group set up two years ago to fight Sky's controversial plans to take over the club, claims to have the backing of the manager Sir Alex Ferguson and wants fans to team up to buy the shares as a way of ensuring United remain independent. \"A 10% stake would make us the biggest single shareholder and act as an automatic block to future threats of hostile takeover,\" said Oliver Houston, a spokesman for Shareholders United. Houston conceded that the scheme was hugely ambitious given that a 10% stake in United would cost \u00a357m. Even if 10,000 fans committed to spend \u00a310 a month each on shares it would take them more than 47 years to reach their target. The real significance of the scheme is that it is being launched with the blessing of the club and is an indication of how relations between the United board and rebel fan groups are improving. The chief executive Peter Kenyon has been keen to build bridges with supporters since taking over from the unpopular Martin Edwards in the autumn. Shareholders United (SU) has been awarded a place in United's new Supporters' Consultative Forum and Kenyon has committed to meeting supporters regularly. A \u00a310,000 cheque, which SU hopes will be the first of regular monthly payments, will be presented to United's stockbrokers Wise Speak before today's home game against Aston Villa. The money will be spent on shares and held in a special account by Wise Speak. Fans will be charged \u00a310 to join the scheme and automatically become shareholders, gaining a say in how the club are run.",

Car tyres slanted away in a vast painted emptiness, obeying laws of capitalist overproduction as much as of perspective. Milroy rummaged in collectors' cabinets for exotic butterflies, rare stamps, Roman coins, pot shards and decorated Greek vases, Japanese mugs and bowls with their heavily pitted glazes, stacks of willow-pattern and dishwasher-safe plates. The things she painted provided her with a painter's problems and opportunities - how to render a slick of light reflected on a Grecian urn, the grooves on an LP, how to paint not just the pot or the plate, but the decoration on its surface, the zebra and its stripes. </p> <p> How far to go into texture, sheen, the details and the decoration. She went on to paint singular images: a profile of a girl with perfect skin and well-brushed hair and kids in skiing gear. Paintings that look like job-lot canvases for hotel bedrooms, and paintings of the hotel rooms themselves. Pictures of Japanese rooms and streets and London's windswept corners - Embankment tube station and a Soho newsagent's where I go to buy Spanish papers, the New York Review of Books, my favourite angling magazines. Milroy prompts you to list things: places, painting styles and idioms. </p> <p> She detoured at one point into what we might see as abstraction - but were these patterned paintings, or paintings of patterns, wallpapers and wrapping papers? Her early painterly shorthand took a lot from Manet and Sargent. Later it shifted to a kind of anonymous suppressed descriptiveness reminiscent of Hopper. Her paintings of Japanese ceramics were photorealist, while her paintings of fast food gleamed with cholesterol and the backlit fakery of the burger joint menu. </p> <p> She has always been interested in how things and their descriptions collide, how painting works, how perilous is its autonomy. The artist herself hung Tate Liverpool's excellent survey of her work, juxtaposing newer works with old, style against style, subject against subject. Her newest works - almost alarming at first sight - are painted in a style reminiscent of the drawings of Posy Simmonds (who is giving a talk at the Tate on Milroy's work). It seems that Milroy has had to re-jig her practice once again in order to focus on the social and on the autobiographical rather than on the surfaces of things (though even her earlier work was in part about the things she liked, her shopping habits, the places she has been and the art she looked at). </p> <p>It has enabled her to be funnier, faster, maybe less self-censoring about what she can put in a painting. Yet the demands of execution - how to paint a crowd, a woman trying lipstick in a shop, how to do jars of cosmetics, speech bubbles and lettering, a shorthand for a thought or feeling - demand just as much rigour, inventiveness, graphic abbreviation as any still life object. She is putting into painting what artists usually leave to their notebooks or their prints (think of the difference between Turner's landscapes and his erotic drawings, Goya's court portraits and his Caprichos). </p> <p>Milroy still has an omnivorous eye, for art as much as for the world of things and places, but she's turning it towards what she used to leave out.

      "body": "<p>The case of the internet twins, Belinda and Kimberley, was last night heading for weeks of courtroom argument on both sides of the Atlantic as the complex inter-country adoption case entered uncharted legal territory.</p> <p>Alan and Judith Kilshaw, the would-be adoptive parents who found the girls through a website run by a Californian child broker, challenged the decision of Flintshire social services to remove the children from their care.</p> <p>The twins - still American citizens - were placed with temporary foster parents in Wales after the council secured an emergency protection order late on Thursday evening.</p> <p>Flintshire county council said the six-month-old twins were \"safe and well\" and it would bring a case to the high court before the end of next week.</p> <p>Philip McGreevy, chief exec utive, said the seizure of the children on Thursday was \"a careful, considered and proportionate response to the emerging circumstances\".</p> <p>But the Kilshaws and their solicitor said they had not yet been given any reasons for an action that conflicted with the adoption order from the US court in Arkansas.</p> <p>Mrs Kilshaw added a further international dimension to the case when she suggested that the family might go abroad rather than return to their seven-bedroom farmhouse in Buckley.</p> <p>\"I'm not going home. I see my future now abroad because I'm the most hated figure in England. I can't live a normal life,\" she said.</p> <p>Mr Kilshaw said he had intended immediate legal action against the emergency protection order, but now thought a delay before high court proceedings next week would give the family breathing space.</p> <p>\"I believe that social services have definitely got it in for us. We have not done anything to give them a major reason to take this course of action.

      "bodyText": "The case of the internet twins, Belinda and Kimberley, was last night heading for weeks of courtroom argument on both sides of the Atlantic as the complex inter-country adoption case entered uncharted legal territory. Alan and Judith Kilshaw, the would-be adoptive parents who found the girls through a website run by a Californian child broker, challenged the decision of Flintshire social services to remove the children from their care. The twins - still American citizens - were placed with temporary foster parents in Wales after the council secured an emergency protection order late on Thursday evening. Flintshire county council said the six-month-old twins were \"safe and well\" and it would bring a case to the high court before the end of next week. Philip McGreevy, chief exec utive, said the seizure of the children on Thursday was \"a careful, considered and proportionate response to the emerging circumstances\". But the Kilshaws and their solicitor said they had not yet been given any reasons for an action that conflicted with the adoption order from the US court in Arkansas. Mrs Kilshaw added a further international dimension to the case when she suggested that the family might go abroad rather than return to their seven-bedroom farmhouse in Buckley. \"I'm not going home. I see my future now abroad because I'm the most hated figure in England. I can't live a normal life,\" she said. Mr Kilshaw said he had intended immediate legal action against the emergency protection order, but now thought a delay before high court proceedings next week would give the family breathing space. \"I believe that social services have definitely got it in for us. We have not done anything to give them a major reason to take this course of action. I rather suspect that someone is behind this, beyond social services, in a political context, but we will have to wait and see,\" he said. A director of social services from another authority said emergency protection orders were normally used when social workers thought a child was suffering or likely to suffer significant harm from abuse or neglect. A possible justification for the Flintshire authorities was that the Kilshaws were regarded as private fosterers, pending settlement of doubts about the legitimacy of the adoption in the US. In that event the children could have been removed if social workers were not getting sufficient access to check their health and well-being. The emergency protection order will lapse after eight days unless it is renewed or, as Flintshire council intends in this case, replaced by more permanent protec tion for the children. The standard procedure would be for the council to apply for an interim care order. This could be done before magistrates who would hear representations from the parents and from a guardian ad litem - an independent person appointed to represent the interests of the child. Given the complexity of this case, the hearing would almost certainly be referred up to a judge in the high court. Dianne Miller, the parents' solicitor, said she favoured moving the case to the high court. Proceedings could also take the form of an application by the parents, the local authority or another person to make the children wards of court. Ms Miller said: \"The only argument is where are the children between now and the case being settled. I want the children home with the parents. My argument is why is temporary foster care better than being with my clients? She said she would be talking to Heather Swindells, a leading counsel specialising in children's law. \"She will be going to the high court in Birmingham on Tuesday. Tuesday is the beginning - the end is some way off.\" The case will be more complicated if the American courts invalidate the adoption and order the children to be returned to US jurisdiction. Although Mr Kilshaw said he would abide by decisions of the courts in Arkansas or the US supreme court, the British courts would need to be satisfied that the children were going back to a safe place. Judge Ellen Brantley, one of six Arkansas judges dealing with adoption, said it was likely that there would be legal action over the babies in the state's courts that could render the adoption invalid. She suggested that the babies' birth mother might be prosecuted for perjury if she returned to Arkansas to seek the return of her children. Rhodri Morgan, first minister of the Welsh assembly, which is reponsible for overseeing social workers in Wales, welcomed the move to take the girls into temporary care.",

      "body": "<p>In four short days, Judith and Alan Kilshaw have gone from being an anonymous middle-aged couple bringing up their young sons in rural north Wales to media villains holding court from their hotel base.</p> <p>Their journey to notoriety began when the Sun published their story on Tuesday about how they had bought twin six-month-old babies Belinda and Kimberley on the internet.</p> <p>The newspaper told the extraordinary story of how the couple had driven 2,000 miles across America with the babies as they sought a quick adoption.</p> <p>Another couple, Richard and Vickie Allen, from California, who had earlier paid \u00a34,000 for the babies from adoption broker Tina Johnson of the Caring Heart Agency, claimed the Kilshaws had kidnapped the girls. After caring for the babies for two months the Allens were tricked into handing them back to their natural mother, Tranda Wecker, and then after a 2,000-mile road trip and transatlantic flight, into the hands of the Kilshaws.</p> <p>Only three weeks after they had returned to their seven-bedroom farmhouse in Buckley with the children, the Kilshaws embarked on a series of interviews to publicise their story. They happily posed with the babies for the cameras.</p> <p>On breakfast television on Tuesday what was supposed to be a live sofa-bound link with the Allens quickly sunk into the spectacle of a transatlantic slanging match, with the interviewer aghast as the Kilshaws traded verbal blows with the Allens.</p> <p>At all times, Judith and Alan Kilshaw were more than willing to speak and eager to explain and defend their actions. Brushing aside any criticism, they vociferously maintained they had done nothing wrong. Mr Kilshaw, a 45-year-old solicitor, encouraged other couples who were thinking of adopting children using the internet to contact them so they could advise other prospective parents of the the pitfalls.</p> <p>But their attempt at openness appears to have been badly misjudged. It fanned the flames of public and political opinion, which were virtually unanimous in criticism of the pair. Both Jack Straw, the home secretary, and Tony Blair expressed disgust about the adoption arrangement.</p> <p>Social services from Flintshire county council attempted, but failed, to contact the couple on Tuesday, when they were holed up in a suite at a luxury hotel near Chester, talking to journalists. By Wednesday, two senior social workers had visited the family and vowed to keep in regular contact with them.</p> <p><b> 'Milky Man'</b><br></p> <p>The following day the Kilshaws' credibility took another knock, when it was reported that they were exploring the possibility of turning their story into a movie.</p> <p>Another US couple stepped into the row and claimed they had been promised the girls by adoption broker Tina Johnson. Amy and Eddie White, from New York State, agreed a deal with Ms Johnson for the twins, but it collapsed when they failed to produce the money quickly enough.</p> <p>Further scorn was heaped on the Kilshaws when it emerged that they had called in paranormal investigators after they and their children thought they saw, heard or felt unexplained phenomena in their farmhouse. One of the couple's two young sons talked of \"the Milky Man\", a ghostly apparition of an old man in a white milkman's coat.</p> <p>Events took a dramatic turn on Thursday night when social services intervened and took the baby girls, by this time staying at the Beaufort Park Hotel in Mold, from their adoptive parents. As cameras flashed, the sleeping babies were removed in their car seats after a tense three-hour confrontation with the Kilshaws. They were then taken to a temporary foster family - their fourth set of carers in only six months of life - after an emergency protection order was granted under the 1989 Children Act.</p> <p>Friends and relatives of the Kilshaws fled the hotel in tears, claiming the babies' removal was unjustified.</p> <p>At the same time in America, Ms Wecker told CBS News that she really wanted the babies back. She claimed that she did not think the Kilshaws were fit parents.</p> <p>Yesterday as Mrs Kilshaw, 47, sought to come to terms with the babies being seized by social workers, the couple indicated that they would appeal against the social services' decision.</p> <p>She said: \"Wherever we go in Britain we are going to be known as the baby snatchers - the internet people. I am going to have to live with this for the rest of my life. I feel as if I can't go home to Buckley because of finger pointing and name calling. With friends like that, who needs enemies? I wish I had never come back. I wish I had stayed in America. I could have sent for the boys.\"</p> <p>Mr Kilshaw said it was \"very regrettable\" that the six-month-old sisters were now living with a fourth family, but blamed social workers for their latest upheaval. \"That has increased by 25% thanks to the actions of social services. Social services have admitted they have been placed with temporary foster carers, which I presume means they will soon have another home.\"</p> <p>But Mrs Kilshaw made it plain that they were going to fight the case all the way and added uncompromisingly: \"If I don't win, I am going back to America to adopt two other children, and stick my fingers up to Britain.\"</p>",

The newspaper told the extraordinary story of how the couple had driven 2,000 miles across America with the babies as they sought a quick adoption. Another couple, Richard and Vickie Allen, from California, who had earlier paid \u00a34,000 for the babies from adoption broker Tina Johnson of the Caring Heart Agency, claimed the Kilshaws had kidnapped the girls. After caring for the babies for two months the Allens were tricked into handing them back to their natural mother, Tranda Wecker, and then after a 2,000-mile road trip and transatlantic flight, into the hands of the Kilshaws. Only three weeks after they had returned to their seven-bedroom farmhouse in Buckley with the children, the Kilshaws embarked on a series of interviews to publicise their story. They happily posed with the babies for the cameras. On breakfast television on Tuesday what was supposed to be a live sofa-bound link with the Allens quickly sunk into the spectacle of a transatlantic slanging match, with the interviewer aghast as the Kilshaws traded verbal blows with the Allens. At all times, Judith and Alan Kilshaw were more than willing to speak and eager to explain and defend their actions. Brushing aside any criticism, they vociferously maintained they had done nothing wrong. Mr Kilshaw, a 45-year-old solicitor, encouraged other couples who were thinking of adopting children using the internet to contact them so they could advise other prospective parents of the the pitfalls. But their attempt at openness appears to have been badly misjudged. It fanned the flames of public and political opinion, which were virtually unanimous in criticism of the pair. Both Jack Straw, the home secretary, and Tony Blair expressed disgust about the adoption arrangement. Social services from Flintshire county council attempted, but failed, to contact the couple on Tuesday, when they were holed up in a suite at a luxury hotel near Chester, talking to journalists. By Wednesday, two senior social workers had visited the family and vowed to keep in regular contact with them. 'Milky Man' The following day the Kilshaws' credibility took another knock, when it was reported that they were exploring the possibility of turning their story into a movie. Another US couple stepped into the row and claimed they had been promised the girls by adoption broker Tina Johnson. Amy and Eddie White, from New York State, agreed a deal with Ms Johnson for the twins, but it collapsed when they failed to produce the money quickly enough. Further scorn was heaped on the Kilshaws when it emerged that they had called in paranormal investigators after they and their children thought they saw, heard or felt unexplained phenomena in their farmhouse. One of the couple's two young sons talked of \"the Milky Man\", a ghostly apparition of an old man in a white milkman's coat. Events took a dramatic turn on Thursday night when social services intervened and took the baby girls, by this time staying at the Beaufort Park Hotel in Mold, from their adoptive parents. As cameras flashed, the sleeping babies were removed in their car seats after a tense three-hour confrontation with the Kilshaws. They were then taken to a temporary foster family - their fourth set of carers in only six months of life - after an emergency protection order was granted under the 1989 Children Act. Friends and relatives of the Kilshaws fled the hotel in tears, claiming the babies' removal was unjustified. At the same time in America, Ms Wecker told CBS News that she really wanted the babies back. She claimed that she did not think the Kilshaws were fit parents. Yesterday as Mrs Kilshaw, 47, sought to come to terms with the babies being seized by social workers, the couple indicated that they would appeal against the social services' decision. She said: \"Wherever we go in Britain we are going to be known as the baby snatchers - the internet people. I am going to have to live with this for the rest of my life. I feel as if I can't go home to Buckley because of finger pointing and name calling. With friends like that, who needs enemies? I wish I had never come back. I wish I had stayed in America. I could have sent for the boys.\" Mr Kilshaw said it was \"very regrettable\" that the six-month-old sisters were now living with a fourth family, but blamed social workers for their latest upheaval. \"That has increased by 25% thanks to the actions of social services. Social services have admitted they have been placed with temporary foster carers, which I presume means they will soon have another home.\" But Mrs Kilshaw made it plain that they were going to fight the case all the way and added uncompromisingly: \"If I don't win, I am going back to America to adopt two other children, and stick my fingers up to Britain.\"",

      "body": "<p>Despite ups and downs of the share prices of dot.com stocks consumer purchases via the net are on the increase, according to new data from the retail sector. </p> <p>Booking holidays and cheap flights through the world wide web is commonplace and many cash-rich but time-poor shoppers delegate grocery buying to the supermarkets' websites and home delivery service. </p> <p>So how is the traditional financial services sector responding. More than 53% of sales of life, pensions and investment products are sold by Independent Financial Advisers (IFAs). IFAs remain the main channel to market despite numerous threats and predictions of their imminent demise, based on the fear that technically literate, young professional people will turn to the internet in droves to buy investment products. This scenario has made some doom merchants predict that as many as 40% of all IFAs may go out of business in the next few years. </p> <p>Yet fears for the demise of these salesmen are exaggerated. A survey commissioned by Focus Solutions reveals that only 10% of 25-35 year olds would avoid seeking financial advice face to face. Moreover, most of the people in this age group are high-earning professionals, of whom fewer than half have made any personal provision for retirement. </p> <p>More than half have not prepared for any loss of income should they contract a serious illness which prevents them from working. Two thirds (65%) claim to have no life assurance policies while nearly 60% have no private medical insurance. </p> <p>Significantly, the research identified that the majority of young professional people have mobile phones and internet access - what Focus terms \"wuppies\" (Young Wired Urban Professionals).

      "bodyText": "Despite ups and downs of the share prices of dot.com stocks consumer purchases via the net are on the increase, according to new data from the retail sector. Booking holidays and cheap flights through the world wide web is commonplace and many cash-rich but time-poor shoppers delegate grocery buying to the supermarkets' websites and home delivery service. So how is the traditional financial services sector responding. More than 53% of sales of life, pensions and investment products are sold by Independent Financial Advisers (IFAs). IFAs remain the main channel to market despite numerous threats and predictions of their imminent demise, based on the fear that technically literate, young professional people will turn to the internet in droves to buy investment products. This scenario has made some doom merchants predict that as many as 40% of all IFAs may go out of business in the next few years. Yet fears for the demise of these salesmen are exaggerated. A survey commissioned by Focus Solutions reveals that only 10% of 25-35 year olds would avoid seeking financial advice face to face. Moreover, most of the people in this age group are high-earning professionals, of whom fewer than half have made any personal provision for retirement. More than half have not prepared for any loss of income should they contract a serious illness which prevents them from working. Two thirds (65%) claim to have no life assurance policies while nearly 60% have no private medical insurance. Significantly, the research identified that the majority of young professional people have mobile phones and internet access - what Focus terms \"wuppies\" (Young Wired Urban Professionals). Wuppies should be easy targets for those financial product providers and advisers who are prepared to invest time and effort to take advantage of the new virtual distribution channels such as the internet, digital TV and the new generation of mobile phones. More than three-quarters of 25-35 year olds surveyed (76%) said that they would be more interested in taking out financial products on-line if it were quicker, easier and safer. So the internet is the perfect solution for those too busy to spend time sitting down periodically with an IFA.It is clear that there is a place for financial advice which can be communicated to clients over the internet which serves to supplement the core activity.

      "body": "<p>Since the beginning of the year a growing number of people have reported difficulties connecting to the internet and sending and receiving email. And time and again, it was the same three internet service providers (ISPs) - BTinternet, AOL and Freeserve - that were the problem. </p> <p>In itself, this may not be a surprise; these three ISPs are the market leaders, according to the most recent figures released by industry analysts MMXI. Freeserve has a media reach of 30% of the total UK internet population, BTinternet 15.4% and AOL 15.3%, so you could argue that the most complaints would come from these companies. </p> <p>But the more cynical might wonder whether the problems might also have something to do with the fact that these three companies might be spending more time and effort signing up new customers than in ensuring they had the technical hardware to deliver the service. After all, the ISPs that often offer the best availability and connection speed are those that are the least successful in attracting new business. </p> <p>Only last week BT announced that it had signed up more than 1m customers to its Together packages since December. Angus Porter, managing director of BT's consumer division, said: \"Take-up of the BT Together packages has far exceeded our expectations.\" Which could be taken to mean, \"we have been slightly caught on the hop\". Not so, says Stephen Brown, BT's head of marketing. \"We have a brand to protect and we try to ensure that we have the capacity to deliver before we launch a service. That is why we have taken our time before announcing our own unmetered internet service in response to AOL's which launched in November.\" </p> <p>BT's new internet package, which will be identical to AOL's in offering unlimited surftime for a fixed subscription of \u00a314.99 per month, will be launched towards the end of this month - at about the same time that Freeserve launches its unmetered AnyTime service which iwill cost \u00a312.99 a month. At present, BT offers unmetered access at weekends and weekdays after 6pm for \u00a39.99 per month, while Freeserve has recently upped its charges for a similar package from \u00a36.99 to \u00a38.99. Both packages will be available after the introduction of the unlimited surftime deals. </p> <p>Even so, Mr Brown admits there were problems with BT's internet service for a couple of weeks in October. \"We had just launched a major subscription drive and at the same time many of our customers were switching from BT Click to BTinternet,\" he says. On the subject of the more recent problems he is less forthcoming, other than to point to the fact that BT was the only major ISP to be awarded a five-star rating by Net-Basics, an independent research group, and to acknowledge that every ISP has problems at times. </p> <p>But the reader who complained that he had been unable to connect to BTinternet for a 24-hour stretch won't be surprised by the latest listings in Internet Magazine.

      "bodyText": "Since the beginning of the year a growing number of people have reported difficulties connecting to the internet and sending and receiving email. And time and again, it was the same three internet service providers (ISPs) - BTinternet, AOL and Freeserve - that were the problem. In itself, this may not be a surprise; these three ISPs are the market leaders, according to the most recent figures released by industry analysts MMXI. Freeserve has a media reach of 30% of the total UK internet population, BTinternet 15.4% and AOL 15.3%, so you could argue that the most complaints would come from these companies. But the more cynical might wonder whether the problems might also have something to do with the fact that these three companies might be spending more time and effort signing up new customers than in ensuring they had the technical hardware to deliver the service. After all, the ISPs that often offer the best availability and connection speed are those that are the least successful in attracting new business. Only last week BT announced that it had signed up more than 1m customers to its Together packages since December. Angus Porter, managing director of BT's consumer division, said: \"Take-up of the BT Together packages has far exceeded our expectations.\" Which could be taken to mean, \"we have been slightly caught on the hop\". Not so, says Stephen Brown, BT's head of marketing. \"We have a brand to protect and we try to ensure that we have the capacity to deliver before we launch a service. That is why we have taken our time before announcing our own unmetered internet service in response to AOL's which launched in November.\" BT's new internet package, which will be identical to AOL's in offering unlimited surftime for a fixed subscription of \u00a314.99 per month, will be launched towards the end of this month - at about the same time that Freeserve launches its unmetered AnyTime service which iwill cost \u00a312.99 a month. At present, BT offers unmetered access at weekends and weekdays after 6pm for \u00a39.99 per month, while Freeserve has recently upped its charges for a similar package from \u00a36.99 to \u00a38.99. Both packages will be available after the introduction of the unlimited surftime deals. Even so, Mr Brown admits there were problems with BT's internet service for a couple of weeks in October. \"We had just launched a major subscription drive and at the same time many of our customers were switching from BT Click to BTinternet,\" he says. On the subject of the more recent problems he is less forthcoming, other than to point to the fact that BT was the only major ISP to be awarded a five-star rating by Net-Basics, an independent research group, and to acknowledge that every ISP has problems at times. But the reader who complained that he had been unable to connect to BTinternet for a 24-hour stretch won't be surprised by the latest listings in Internet Magazine. Each month the magazine's technical editor, David Wildy, tests each dial-up ISP for availability and speed of connection and in the space of two months BT has fallen from 12th to 97th. In the same period Freeserve has fallen from 16th to 101st. AOL has declined to take part in the independent monthly tests. \"There are problems with demand outstripping supply,\" says Mr Wildy, \"Especially when ISPs launch new offers. The problem is that the telephone system was designed for analog; no one ever imagined that the copper wires would be used to carry digital data. There isn't the bandwidth in the pipes to cope at peak times and until the system is upgraded the service will be less than perfect.\" This is a theme close to the heart of Matt Peacock, AOL's UK director of corporate communications.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded earnings forecasts to \u00a3473m ahead of next week's statement, saying it was \"unnecessary to wait\". The current consensus is profits of \u00a3485m - up from \u00a3417m last year, but still less than half 1998 levels, when the group made \u00a31.2bn.",

It has come up with an ambitious \u00a360m regeneration plan to wake from its slumbers and become England's premier conference venue. If the project - spearheaded by East Riding county council - goes ahead, it will be the single largest development of its kind on the east coast of England. Plans include a shimmering new conference centre which could attract thousands of delegates to meet, talk and gaze over the breezy North sea. A 500-berth marina would pull in big-spending boat owners, and new commercial, leisure and residential developments would also help to revive the resort's fortunes. Bridlington is typical of an English seaside town in winter with its closed cafes and vacant, tacky, amusement arcades.

      "body": "<p>Sir Brian Moffat, chairman and acting chief executive of Corus, is unlikely to have a restful weekend. Perhaps as early as next week, he will tell us how he plans to stop the Anglo-Dutch steel group haemorrhaging losses that, in Britain alone, have probably grown to \u00a3500m over the last year. </p> <p>Treading a political, as well as financial, tightrope, he faces two ineluctable variables: the future course of sterling against both the euro and dollar; and UK demand for steel as our domestic manufacturing base continues to shrink. Both are completely out of his control, not least because none of us knows if or when Britain might join the single currency. </p> <p>It is commonly understood that a good portion of Corus's recent losses stem from the strength of the pound against the euro. So why, the unions are frantically asking, is Sir Brian considering the closure of Llanwern, the steel mill near Newport, Gwent, and perhaps also large chunks of Lackenby on Tees-side, when the predicted recovery of the euro should reverse the trend in profitability. Why not close IJmuiden, the group's main Dutch plant on the North Sea coast, instead - especially when productivity in Britain has risen so remarkably over the past decade: from 348 tonnes per employee per year in 1989 to 571? </p> <p>But that, Sir Brian will argue, misses a crucial point, namely that over the same period steel consumption in Britain has fallen 10%, while US demand has risen 28% and Germany's is up 10%. What is more, in Britain much of the demand has been satisfied by intermediate or finished goods imported from overseas. Recent figures show that steel imports made up 49% of the British market in 2000 compared with 44% in 1999 and 29% in 1989. </p> <p>In the same period, the old British Steel has seen exports increase as a share of production from 30% to 50% - a rise that testifies to the shrinkage of its home market and, given sterling's strength, the impact on its margins. </p> <p>With UK-based car groups planning to cut the British content of their output from 80% to 50% at best, Sir Brian's graphs on future demand from UK manufacturing must look very bleak. </p> <p>Politically, the fallout will be enormous, especially in Wales where a campaign to save Llanwern and 4500 jobs has been launched by Team Wales - politicians, industry, including the WDA development agency, and unions. Manufacturing in Britain accounts for 15% of GDP; in Wales it is nearly twice as high. If Llanwern goes it is assumed Labour will pay the electoral price through heavy losses to Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party, in May. </p> <p>So will the government intervene? Certainly the Welsh lobbying has been enormous compared with hardly a shout from the north-east of England. Stephen Byers, industry secretary, and Rhodri Morgan, first minister of the national assembly for Wales, are trying to put together a package of measures worth at most \u00a320m to stay Sir Brian's hand on the axe. The outcome remains unclear but he is bound to cut out large swaths of Corus's British operations, especially in Wales, to bring production and sales back into kilter and reboot shareholder value. </p> <p>The real question for the government is not whether it can jig together a package that will get Brussels' approval, but the role it foresees for manufacturing in Britain. It has to decide whether the country that began the industrial revolution is the first to kiss it goodbye. Sir Brian's plan will help ministers focus on that emotive issue. </p> <p><strong> Muppetry </strong><br> </p> <p>There was a small prick to the traditional Friday afternoon torpor in the Square Mile yesterday when news spread that a \"small British investment bank\" is ready to buy the 50% stake in formula one held by Germany's EM.TV, thus scuppering the rescue of EM which media group Kirch is desperately trying to hold together. </p> <p>Word had it that a representative of the unnamed British bank met EM's supervisory board chief, Nickolaus Becker, in Geneva on Thursday, offering to pay around \u00a3400m for the stake - an offer EM was minded to accept, despite having paid the racy Bernie Ecclestone almost \u00a31.2bn for the holding last year. </p> <p>Intriguing stuff - especially when there are so few independent British investment banks left, big or small. </p> <p>The \"bank\" eventually turned out to be Morgan Grenfell Private Equity, the venture arm of Deutsche Bank, part of a consortium headed by one of EM's associate companies, which (bear with us here) plans to takeover EM and then fund its stake in the grand prix holding company with venture capital. </p> <p>This particular business of sport makes the head spin. As one banker who has worked on formula one's fiendishly complicated finances, commented yesterday: \"Anyone who thinks they can buy it and rip off Ecclestone in the process is a complete muppet.\"</p>",

Why not close IJmuiden, the group's main Dutch plant on the North Sea coast, instead - especially when productivity in Britain has risen so remarkably over the past decade: from 348 tonnes per employee per year in 1989 to 571? But that, Sir Brian will argue, misses a crucial point, namely that over the same period steel consumption in Britain has fallen 10%, while US demand has risen 28% and Germany's is up 10%. What is more, in Britain much of the demand has been satisfied by intermediate or finished goods imported from overseas. Recent figures show that steel imports made up 49% of the British market in 2000 compared with 44% in 1999 and 29% in 1989. In the same period, the old British Steel has seen exports increase as a share of production from 30% to 50% - a rise that testifies to the shrinkage of its home market and, given sterling's strength, the impact on its margins. With UK-based car groups planning to cut the British content of their output from 80% to 50% at best, Sir Brian's graphs on future demand from UK manufacturing must look very bleak. Politically, the fallout will be enormous, especially in Wales where a campaign to save Llanwern and 4500 jobs has been launched by Team Wales - politicians, industry, including the WDA development agency, and unions. Manufacturing in Britain accounts for 15% of GDP; in Wales it is nearly twice as high. If Llanwern goes it is assumed Labour will pay the electoral price through heavy losses to Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party, in May. So will the government intervene? Certainly the Welsh lobbying has been enormous compared with hardly a shout from the north-east of England. Stephen Byers, industry secretary, and Rhodri Morgan, first minister of the national assembly for Wales, are trying to put together a package of measures worth at most \u00a320m to stay Sir Brian's hand on the axe. The outcome remains unclear but he is bound to cut out large swaths of Corus's British operations, especially in Wales, to bring production and sales back into kilter and reboot shareholder value. The real question for the government is not whether it can jig together a package that will get Brussels' approval, but the role it foresees for manufacturing in Britain. It has to decide whether the country that began the industrial revolution is the first to kiss it goodbye. Sir Brian's plan will help ministers focus on that emotive issue. Muppetry There was a small prick to the traditional Friday afternoon torpor in the Square Mile yesterday when news spread that a \"small British investment bank\" is ready to buy the 50% stake in formula one held by Germany's EM.TV, thus scuppering the rescue of EM which media group Kirch is desperately trying to hold together. Word had it that a representative of the unnamed British bank met EM's supervisory board chief, Nickolaus Becker, in Geneva on Thursday, offering to pay around \u00a3400m for the stake - an offer EM was minded to accept, despite having paid the racy Bernie Ecclestone almost \u00a31.2bn for the holding last year. Intriguing stuff - especially when there are so few independent British investment banks left, big or small. The \"bank\" eventually turned out to be Morgan Grenfell Private Equity, the venture arm of Deutsche Bank, part of a consortium headed by one of EM's associate companies, which (bear with us here) plans to takeover EM and then fund its stake in the grand prix holding company with venture capital. This particular business of sport makes the head spin. As one banker who has worked on formula one's fiendishly complicated finances, commented yesterday: \"Anyone who thinks they can buy it and rip off Ecclestone in the process is a complete muppet.\"",

Drunks at the bar: All bar staff get legal power to refuse to serve drunks. Anti-social antics Child curfews: power to raise the age limit from 10 to 15 years for those banned from being out in specific area after 9pm. This power appeared in 1998 act but has not been used. New legislation will enable police, in addition to the local authority, to apply to the court for a curfew order. The curfew can last up to 90 days.

The Home Office had hoped that 5,000 orders a year would be issued, but applications are running at only 100 a year. Bill extends police power to provide witness protection from intimidation and fear of violence, to encourage more applications. For the first time such powers are to be used in civil cases. Police powers Seizure: power to overturn the \"Bramley judgment\", which ruled that Derbyshire police had wrongly seized a computer hard disk containing confidential correspondence between a suspect and his solicitor.

About 50,000 such samples were held last year and will now have to be destroyed, as legislation is not retrospective. The bill gives the police power to retain and use DNA samples given voluntarily, eg by village residents after series of rapes. Police Federation opposes this measure for its members, saying constables should not be forced to give DNA samples, on human rights grounds. Nurses as well as doctors are allowed to take intimate samples for DNA profiling. Ministers hope to expand DNA database from 1m to 3m samples within three years. Pilot schemes: schemes to test changes to police powers to stop and search and detain suspects are allowed without par liamentary approval. Suspects' rights: right to object to videotaping of interviews scrapped. Granting bail: courts to give reasons if they grant bail against prosecution and police advice. Passports: convicted drug traffickers' passports to be confiscated. Importing child pornography: an arrestable offence. Records: confidentiality of Inland Revenue records removed for all criminal investigations, and much greater powers given to Department of Trade and Industry inspectors. Police training Right to silence: removed in police disciplinary hearings. New ranks: ranks of deputy chief constable and chief superintendent reintroduced. These were abolished in 1995, but half the forces retained them, even though there was no legal basis for them. Colleges: new independent central training college. Funding: for national criminal intelligence service and national crime squad. Age ban lifted: people over 70 can serve on police authorities.",

An opinion poll conducted in eight European countries, and published by the Guardian last Monday, shows that the \"feel-good factor\" in Britain is much stronger than in France, Germany, Italy or Spain. Only the citizens of Luxembourg and the Netherlands, among the countries polled, are more cheerful than we are about their prospects, and more confident in the ability of government to improve their lot. But I expect that this is just because smallness in nations has a tendency to breed smugness. Why should the British be more delighted with their condition than countries with excellent hospitals, efficient train services, good schools, fewer single mothers, fewer drug addicts and less crime? That's what I want to know. </p> <p>The British are the continent's greatest newspaper readers, and I would have thought that the perusal of any newspaper any day of the week would crush any optimism they might be tempted to feel. The Sunday newspapers are usually the most depressing. Last Sunday's not only dwelt at length on the callousness and incompetence of the police, medical and social services in the horrific case of Anna Climbie, the poor little girl from the Ivory Coast who was tortured to death before their eyes. One paper had a front-page picture of seven dead bodies, casually wrapped in sheets, that had been dumped without ceremony in a carpeted, unrefrigerated room in a NHS hospital in Bedford. Others were full of the usual tales of betrayal, perfidy and moral turpitude. The copy of the Evening Standard I have just bought says that muggings in London have risen by 27%. </p> <p>I was feeling quite depressed anyway on Sunday as I waited at Taunton station for a delayed train to take me to London; and I was not cheered up by a recorded voice repeatedly announcing that it would be 14 minutes late, long after the 14 minutes had passed. Buying a sandwich and some newspapers in the station buffet to while away the time, I chanced on an article in the Sunday Telegraph that depressed me even more. This reported another opinion poll finding that Sir Richard Branson was chosen from a slightly bizarre list of characters as the second most \"inspirational\" figure in history (Nelson Mandela came first). </p> <p>What makes Branson so inspiring - that he goes up in balloons, that he wants to run the National Lottery, that his train from Taunton on Sunday was 45 minutes delayed? It is probably just the fact that he has made lots of money that put him streets ahead of the Pope, Sir Winston Churchill, Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King in the inspirational stakes. Mother Teresa just made it on to the list, but she was well behind Britney Spears, the teenage American singing siren. An even more surprising nominee was Earl Spencer, presumably for his anti-royal address at his sister's funeral a few years back. </p> <p>The same poll asked people which publications \"have had the most positive influence on life in Britain today\". Newspapers were top choice, followed by the Bible, and in third place - can you believe it? - The Highway Code. Even more amazing is that Hello! came sixth, just behind the Koran and above The Little Book Of Calm. The Highway Code may be prized for encouraging people to drive carefully and to avoid the frightening explosions of road rage that I seem inexplicably to provoke in other drivers, but it is extremely hard to understand in what way Hello! can be thought to exert a positive influence on British society. </p> <p>The main conclusion I draw from the poll is that the two things that are most \"inspirational\" and \"positive\" to the people of Britain are money and the celebrity culture, for newspapers promote the latter almost as much as Hello!. The notion that Mandela is a sort of god has been so drummed into people's minds that his status as most inspirational person ever to 65% of respondents, probably doesn't mean much. Jesus Christ got only 1%, as did the royal family. So, if my conclusion is correct, it is hardly surprising that the British people are so contented. They have never been more prosperous, and the celebrity culture has never been so strong. </p> <p>It may be that my current debt to the Inland Revenue would in any event reduce my potential to feel good, but the Sunday Telegraph poll certainly makes me feel worse.

As animal rights protesters stepped up their demonstrations outside the Cambridgeshire laboratory and in the financial district of London, it became increasingly evident that the company had found a way to repay a \u00a322m loan which fell due yesterday. Huntingdon executives, who have been fighting to restore the laboratory's reputation since evidence of cruelty to animals was uncovered in 1997, spent most of yesterday locked in talks with US bankers to come up with a long-term solution to the company's financial problems. The laboratory had faced closure last night unless it could persuade Royal Bank of Scotland to extend its portion of the \u00a322m loan while it continued talks with a number of potential backers in the US. The bank, which inherited the loan when it bought NatWest last year, has been extending the repayment period since August when it ran out. The bank is thought to have found a way to extricate itself from the loss-making company even though it has faced mounting pressure from the government, the pharmaceutical industry and its trades unions to maintain support. It has also faced protests outside its branches and the homes of its directors. Yesterday activists demonstrated outside its office in London. The office of the investment bank Merrill Lynch, which does not own Huntingdon shares directly but on behalf of clients, were also picketed.

How we swooned at the doe-eyed beauty of Julian Clary as Dandini, at the hands-on stroppiness and tiny ankles of Joanne Good's Fairy Godmother and at the remarkable voice of Dave Benson Phillips, who may have made his name running around like a madman on children's TV but who actually has a pair of pipes to shame Levi Stubbs. </p> <p>But a special welcome is always reserved for the Ugly Sisters. Ugly Sisters are, of course, always played by men and, though conventional feminism might look at them askance, I find them oddly appealing and sound; the very fact that no woman, however unattractive, is ever thought to be ugly enough to be an Ugly Sister is a testament to the superior beauty of women. In recent years, we have seen the decline of the Principal Boy, traditionally played by an attractive, athletic girl with extremely good gams; how much of this can be put down to a growing awareness of designer dykery, and our inability to see two pretty girls snogging without putting the worst possible interpretation on it? But you never think of sex when you see the Ugly Sisters. </p> <p>The best reason for their continuing existence is that they demonstrate how very stupid men look, in fact, when they dress up as women. In the context of panto, this is perfectly appropriate. But for the rest of them, I see no difference between transvestite entertainers and the late Black and White Minstrels. They're both extremely offensive, and I don't understand why one is beyond the pale and the other totally acceptable in enlightened circles. </p> <p>And, yes, I know that they're not the same, but may I say that I feel even less patience with transsexuals. Male to female transsexuals are Michael Jackson to the transvestites Ali G; not content even to dress up temporarily as the Other, they presume that its authenticity can be theirs through a few cosmetic adjustments. We laugh at people who want to change colour; we are shocked that millions of Japanese women each year have their eyes permanently occidentalised; we ban skin-lightening preparations, and would never dream of letting black people have Jackson-type whitening operations on the NHS. </p> <p>Yet we pay for thousands of men every year to \"become\" women; around 7,000 at \u00a38,000 a pop, and rising every year. You do the maths. \"Oh, but I'm a woman trapped in a man's body!\" So? What about all the white people who feel black, black people who feel white, poor people with rich people's tastes and short people who are dying to be tall? They're all welcome to go off and seek to make their dreams a reality, but I don't see the NHS spending money that could be better spent on hip operations, cancer treatments and simply cleaning up our filthy hospitals. The NHS was never designed to be a sort of state-run Jim'll Fix It, and I don't understand why gender must be the one exception. </p> <p>The Daily Mail seems to have a special, not quite wholesome interest in male-to-female transsexuals, featuring at least one a month in extensive Before and After poses, with a headline typically saying something like THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SIR WHO WANTS TO BE A MISS; Nicholas/Nicola the Charterhouse teacher, Ian/Isabelle the Oxford tutor, Bill/Dian the Welsh preacher and Simon/Carol the C of E vicar. Its attitude used to be that these people were dangerous sexual radicals; now, it seeks to portray them as tragic victims. </p> <p>My objection to trannies, though, is that they are woefully conventional souls (typical Mail readers, in fact) who seem unable to exist alongside any sort of ambiguity, which as we all know is one of the things that makes life so interesting. I wouldn't have the least problem leaving a young girl child in the care of any of them - I'd fear sexual molestation far less than from a \"straight\" man - but I would be worried that, by the time I came home, the child would be dressed from head to toe in pink and being danced round the room to the saccharine strains of Thank Heaven For Little Girls. </p> <p>It is the literal-mindedness, the clunky logic of transsexuals, that is so appalling (that, and their taste in blouses), not their sexual depravity. They are frilly, docile smilers who always wear make-up and never the trousers. Their idea of womanhood seems to have survived intact from 1953. Despite their sticky lipstick rictuses, they are the ultimate example of a particularly middle-class, middle-aged male arrogance that cannot see why anything it desires shouldn't be so. </p> <p>Such men invariably report that they were aware of feeling \"trapped\" in the wrong body since boyhood. Yet, thoughtfully, they go ahead and marry blissfully ignorant women and father children. Then, in middle age, with the kids off their hands, and when their wives are looking forward to kicking back and relaxing \u00e0 deux, she comes home one day from Marks &amp; Spencer to find hubby prancing about in her second-best Frank Usher frock and committing GBH on her new Carvela kitten heels. These poor stunned women - talk about feeling you've been sold a pup! - are then told by the caring professionals and counsellors to accept their husbands as \"sisters\". Just switch it for a moment and imagine that thousands of women decided they wanted penises. Would their husbands be expected to stay with them and live as brothers? Somehow, I doubt it. But it seems that whatever men choose to do - be it buy pornography from sweetshops, masturbate at impoverished single mothers on \"chatlines\", walk naked in the street (as Vincent Bethell was given the right to do last week) or demand to be called Daphne - must at all costs be normalised, whereas, for women, the rules are all but unshifting. </p> <p>Transsexualism is, basically, just another, more drastic twist on the male menopause, which in turn is just another excuse for men to do as they please. And before the geek chorus - hi fans! - start up, yes, I know I've been pretty damned selfish during my long and squalid marital career. The difference is, of course, that I've never sought to dress up my own egoism in poor-me-trapped-in-the-wrong-life claptrap, and I've certainly never expected the taxpayer to hand over more than \u00a38,000 in order to set me up in a love nest with my new squeeze. No - at the end of the day, changing sex is no more noble than changing your wife for a new woman. Only, this time, the woman is you.</p>",

The one exception to that, I asserted at first, was a batsman called Arthur Shrewsbury, who was highly rated by WG Grace. Having been rebuked by a reader who said that Shrewsbury was not a cathedral city, I then declared that my so-called exception did not apply. I am now rebuked, however, for believing what I was told. For Shrewsbury is a cathedral city; it's just that the cathedral is Roman Catholic** rather than Anglican. </p> <p>Terence Hall of Pendlebury, Manchester, prefers to be positive. (\"Pendlebury people prefer to be positive\", as the local saw has it.) He thinks the safest course the selectors can take is to pick players whose names coincide with places in Lancashire, such as Atherton, Denton, Hutton, Leyland, Rhodes, Tyldesley and Wardle. There are 17 names on his list, though unhappily all but three are dead. Should a player called Blackburn or Lancaster come to the fore, the selectorate will be in a bit of a pickle, since these names belong to towns which are in Lancashire (good), but have a cathedral (bad, unless it is Shrewsbury). The same applies to players called Manchester, Salford or Liverpool, but I don't suppose there are many of them. </p> <p>Wit and wisdom on horseback - an occcasional Smallweed series, no 323: \"We are not cruel, and I am quite sure if the fox had a vote between nature and hunting he would vote for hunting.\"- Vet Professor \"Twink\" Allen from the Equine Fertility Unit in Newmarket, taking to the Press Association*** at a rally on Wednesday</p> <p> Next week in Smallweed: <strong> Why I'd like to vote for Christmas, by a turkey.</strong> </p> <p> A final, absolutely ultimate, last-ever (probably) footnote on Acton. I have news of the whereabouts of the elusive 94 bus. Roger Newport, of Bitton near Bristol, has seen one! In full London Transport livery, too, and displaying the destination \"Piccadilly Circus\"; but outside Katoomba railway station, in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, which is not much use if you're stuck at a bus stop at Turnham Green station.</p> <p> Mr Newport's technical notes - not sponsored by Faucets for Grohe, I am happy to say: <br> (1) The bus carried the garage code \"A\" which, in Mr Newport's day, referred to the output of Sutton garage. Yet Acton buses do not run out of Sutton! (2) The type of vehicle (a Bristol make) and the UK registration still visible (HHL 139L) show that the bus never ran in London anyway. (Some of my correspondents complain, of course, that the real 94 does not do so either.) In other words, he explains,it's merely a tourist attraction**** which has borrowed the hallowed name of route 94. </p> <p>*As alert readers will notice, this word is an anagram of \"Acton is alert\". **An anagram of \"Acton charm oil.\" ***An anagram of \"Acton Oasis's spire.\" ****An anagram of \"Acton tart?

All these recent altercations* about Acton have led Smallweed to neglect a number of pithy letters about an earlier columnar controversy: my contention that England cricket selectors are always unwise to choose players whose names coincide with those of cathedral cities. The one exception to that, I asserted at first, was a batsman called Arthur Shrewsbury, who was highly rated by WG Grace. Having been rebuked by a reader who said that Shrewsbury was not a cathedral city, I then declared that my so-called exception did not apply. I am now rebuked, however, for believing what I was told. For Shrewsbury is a cathedral city; it's just that the cathedral is Roman Catholic** rather than Anglican. Terence Hall of Pendlebury, Manchester, prefers to be positive. (\"Pendlebury people prefer to be positive\", as the local saw has it.) He thinks the safest course the selectors can take is to pick players whose names coincide with places in Lancashire, such as Atherton, Denton, Hutton, Leyland, Rhodes, Tyldesley and Wardle. There are 17 names on his list, though unhappily all but three are dead. Should a player called Blackburn or Lancaster come to the fore, the selectorate will be in a bit of a pickle, since these names belong to towns which are in Lancashire (good), but have a cathedral (bad, unless it is Shrewsbury). The same applies to players called Manchester, Salford or Liverpool, but I don't suppose there are many of them. Wit and wisdom on horseback - an occcasional Smallweed series, no 323: \"We are not cruel, and I am quite sure if the fox had a vote between nature and hunting he would vote for hunting.\"- Vet Professor \"Twink\" Allen from the Equine Fertility Unit in Newmarket, taking to the Press Association*** at a rally on Wednesday Next week in Smallweed: Why I'd like to vote for Christmas, by a turkey. A final, absolutely ultimate, last-ever (probably) footnote on Acton. I have news of the whereabouts of the elusive 94 bus. Roger Newport, of Bitton near Bristol, has seen one! In full London Transport livery, too, and displaying the destination \"Piccadilly Circus\"; but outside Katoomba railway station, in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, which is not much use if you're stuck at a bus stop at Turnham Green station. Mr Newport's technical notes - not sponsored by Faucets for Grohe, I am happy to say: (1) The bus carried the garage code \"A\" which, in Mr Newport's day, referred to the output of Sutton garage. Yet Acton buses do not run out of Sutton! (2) The type of vehicle (a Bristol make) and the UK registration still visible (HHL 139L) show that the bus never ran in London anyway. (Some of my correspondents complain, of course, that the real 94 does not do so either.) In other words, he explains,it's merely a tourist attraction**** which has borrowed the hallowed name of route 94. *As alert readers will notice, this word is an anagram of \"Acton is alert\". **An anagram of \"Acton charm oil.\" ***An anagram of \"Acton Oasis's spire.\" ****An anagram of \"Acton tart? I?\" Smallweed@theguardian.com",

But yesterday Mikelangelo and Rina Attard - parents of the conjoined twins known to the world as Jodie and Mary - arrived home to bury one of their daughters. As night fell over the Maltese island of Gozo, Mary, the twin who had to die to save her sister, was laid to rest in a cemetery on a peaceful hillside overlooking farmers' fields and the sea. The simple grave is to be adorned in marble and will become a melancholy shrine for would-be mothers and their families. In time, perhaps in the next couple of months, the Attards will be making a happier journey when they carry Jodie, now a bright and lively girl aged five months, back to their home village of Xaghra. But yesterday was about Mary and a close-knit, devout community finally closing a tragic chapter. When the Attards' white taxi, which followed the hearse containing Mary's tiny white coffin, pulled into the outskirts of the village, their neighbours and relatives poured out on to the single main street and applauded. When they followed the coffin into the village's lavish 17th century basilica, the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin, the congregation rose and again applauded the couple. Mrs Attard, 29, greeted friends she had not seen for more than six months. Her husband, a 44-year-old plasterer, sobbed. It was a day of sadness but also one of reunion and reconciliation because a family which had been absent for so long were now back among their nearest and dearest. It was not, agreed relatives and community and religious leaders, a day for blame. The Bishop of Gozo, where 95% of people are Catholics and abortion is considered evil, has had harsh criticism in the past for the ruling made in the British courts that the operation to separate the twins, born joined at the abdomen, had to take place although it meant certain death for Mary. Bishop Nicholas Cauchi gave the homily during the funeral service as a mark of \"solidarity\" with the Attards, who had fiercely opposed the operation on religious grounds believing that nature should be allowed to take its course even after doctors had made it clear that both girls would eventually die if nothing was done. The bishop said he was not going to use the homily to apportion blame but there was, nevertheless, a hint of bitterness in his words when he suggested that there were those who \"perhaps didn't do enough so that the sacrifice of [Mary] could be avoided\". The Attards had considered bringing both Jodie, who is still being treated at St Mary's hospital in Manchester, and Mary's body back.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>So Labour is now the party of publishers and greengrocers, Conservative the party of bookmakers. The brouhaha about political funding could encourage an unprecedented national interest in the nature of entrepreneurship. </p> <p>Stuart Wheeler's \u00a35m donation to the Tories will seem appropriate to many City types, for his spreadbetting firm IG Index became a dealing room institution during Margaret Thatcher's heyday. Opening an account with IG or its rival Sporting Index was a 1980s rite of passage. Manhood was measured by the stoicism with which a broker bore his losses on West Indies runs or Chelsea corners. </p> <p>Almost every newspaper spiced up its report of Mr Wheeler's largesse with a reference to IG's odds on the outcome of the upcoming general election. The prices quoted on the number of seats to be won suggest Labour will romp home once more. A case of Man Utd v Carlisle, rather than an Old Firm derby. </p> <p>Mr Wheeler may or may not be backing a loser. There is no inconsistency, however, between IG's election prices and its founder's belief in a William Hague premiership. The skill of IG's price-makers lies in reflecting the current balance of market opinion. The spreadbetting business premise is identical to that of market-making in the stock market - simply to reflect the prevailing balance of supply and demand and not to bet outright on possible outcomes. </p> <p>More scary for many will be the realisation that Mr Wheeler may not actually care too greatly that he could be backing a loser. There will be much speculation that political gifts of this magnitude cannot come \"no strings attached\". Such cynicism is understandable. After all, there is now a fair smattering of ermine hanging off the shoulders of donors to both the Labour and Conservative parties. But one must allow for the rather peculiar nature of entrepreneurs. </p> <p>The pursuit of wealth is rather like the London marathon. The starting line is crowded with competitors of all shapes, sizes, ages and backgrounds. The vast majority have no hope of featuring at the finish. Only a few harbour any realistic dreams of winning rather than merely taking part. </p> <p>Those with genuine hopes of triumphing in the race to riches seem - at least to my outsider's eye - to draw sustenance from wealth simply as numbers, rather than as a means to another end. After all, the point at which most families' needs could be met is passed long before the runners hang up their corporate trainers. What is it that keeps them going? </p> <p>British entrepreneurs tend only rarely to catch the public eye. This is not (yet) America, where the pursuit of riches is lauded as vindication of the entire socio-economic and political system. Here it is only celebrity industrialists, such as Richard Branson or Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who enjoy prolonged spells in the limelight. Others only do so fleetingly, and then often for reasons of notoriety rather than success. </p> <p>Most recently Greg Hutchins, former chief executive of Tomkins, springs to mind. His corporate derring-do in the 1980s never made him a tabloid name. Recent alleged abuse of the corporate expense account did. Fifteen minutes of fame indeed. </p> <p>It is when the chips are down that the mettle of the entrepreneur is revealed. Fear of failure is a powerful motivating force. The actions of executives are often best understood through an analysis of the possible consequences of cock-up rather than of success. </p> <p>In the quoted company arena this is manifested in corporate paranoia about falling share prices. More sellers than buyers is interpreted as disapproval of a company's strategy, a negative view of its prospects, and a vote against its management. </p> <p>If I had a pound for every time a chief executive complained about the price of his company's shares, or moaned that investors misunderstood him and his company... Well, you know the story. </p> <p>Company directors read far too much into the day-to-day fluctuations of their share prices. They are also prone to introspection and, as a consequence, fail to recognise the broader economic and market forces beyond their control. </p> <p>A falling price is less often a vote of no confidence than they imagine. But if the pursuit of wealth does become no more than an obsessive race to make a big number bigger, a share price will stand as the ultimate arbiter of success - and a very public one at that. </p> <p>Floating one's company on the stock exchange places a monetary value on an entrepreneur's success. It can also allow him to pocket some of his past work in hard cash. But a market listing brings aggravation and risk. So to choose public rather than private status is to decide not to put a tick in the \"no publicity\" box. </p> <p>Mr Wheeler floated IG Index on the London exchange last year. This may have allowed him to make the donation announced this week - having one's wealth tied up in unquoted equity can make it difficult to write a big cheque. </p> <p>The flotation was publicised with cheesy photographs of Mr Wheeler wearing a footie shirt over his pinstripes, emblazoned with his company's share price. This looks like one entrepreneur who has decided that celebrity may prove to be one motivation to stay in the race. </p> <p>\u0095 Edmond Warner is chief executive of Old Mutual Securities.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:edmondw@omsecurities.co.uk\">edmondw@omsecurities.co.uk</a></p>",

The brouhaha about political funding could encourage an unprecedented national interest in the nature of entrepreneurship. Stuart Wheeler's \u00a35m donation to the Tories will seem appropriate to many City types, for his spreadbetting firm IG Index became a dealing room institution during Margaret Thatcher's heyday. Opening an account with IG or its rival Sporting Index was a 1980s rite of passage. Manhood was measured by the stoicism with which a broker bore his losses on West Indies runs or Chelsea corners. Almost every newspaper spiced up its report of Mr Wheeler's largesse with a reference to IG's odds on the outcome of the upcoming general election. The prices quoted on the number of seats to be won suggest Labour will romp home once more. A case of Man Utd v Carlisle, rather than an Old Firm derby. Mr Wheeler may or may not be backing a loser. There is no inconsistency, however, between IG's election prices and its founder's belief in a William Hague premiership. The skill of IG's price-makers lies in reflecting the current balance of market opinion. The spreadbetting business premise is identical to that of market-making in the stock market - simply to reflect the prevailing balance of supply and demand and not to bet outright on possible outcomes. More scary for many will be the realisation that Mr Wheeler may not actually care too greatly that he could be backing a loser. There will be much speculation that political gifts of this magnitude cannot come \"no strings attached\". Such cynicism is understandable. After all, there is now a fair smattering of ermine hanging off the shoulders of donors to both the Labour and Conservative parties. But one must allow for the rather peculiar nature of entrepreneurs. The pursuit of wealth is rather like the London marathon. The starting line is crowded with competitors of all shapes, sizes, ages and backgrounds. The vast majority have no hope of featuring at the finish. Only a few harbour any realistic dreams of winning rather than merely taking part. Those with genuine hopes of triumphing in the race to riches seem - at least to my outsider's eye - to draw sustenance from wealth simply as numbers, rather than as a means to another end. After all, the point at which most families' needs could be met is passed long before the runners hang up their corporate trainers. What is it that keeps them going? British entrepreneurs tend only rarely to catch the public eye. This is not (yet) America, where the pursuit of riches is lauded as vindication of the entire socio-economic and political system. Here it is only celebrity industrialists, such as Richard Branson or Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who enjoy prolonged spells in the limelight. Others only do so fleetingly, and then often for reasons of notoriety rather than success. Most recently Greg Hutchins, former chief executive of Tomkins, springs to mind. His corporate derring-do in the 1980s never made him a tabloid name. Recent alleged abuse of the corporate expense account did. Fifteen minutes of fame indeed. It is when the chips are down that the mettle of the entrepreneur is revealed. Fear of failure is a powerful motivating force. The actions of executives are often best understood through an analysis of the possible consequences of cock-up rather than of success. In the quoted company arena this is manifested in corporate paranoia about falling share prices. More sellers than buyers is interpreted as disapproval of a company's strategy, a negative view of its prospects, and a vote against its management. If I had a pound for every time a chief executive complained about the price of his company's shares, or moaned that investors misunderstood him and his company... Well, you know the story. Company directors read far too much into the day-to-day fluctuations of their share prices. They are also prone to introspection and, as a consequence, fail to recognise the broader economic and market forces beyond their control. A falling price is less often a vote of no confidence than they imagine. But if the pursuit of wealth does become no more than an obsessive race to make a big number bigger, a share price will stand as the ultimate arbiter of success - and a very public one at that. Floating one's company on the stock exchange places a monetary value on an entrepreneur's success. It can also allow him to pocket some of his past work in hard cash. But a market listing brings aggravation and risk. So to choose public rather than private status is to decide not to put a tick in the \"no publicity\" box. Mr Wheeler floated IG Index on the London exchange last year. This may have allowed him to make the donation announced this week - having one's wealth tied up in unquoted equity can make it difficult to write a big cheque. The flotation was publicised with cheesy photographs of Mr Wheeler wearing a footie shirt over his pinstripes, emblazoned with his company's share price. This looks like one entrepreneur who has decided that celebrity may prove to be one motivation to stay in the race. \u0095 Edmond Warner is chief executive of Old Mutual Securities. edmondw@omsecurities.co.uk",

The hydraulic power station, built in 1890 and closed in l977, once lifted Tower Bridge and moved the revolving stage of the Palladium. It stood derelict until seven years ago when a feisty educational psychologist-cum-theatrical director, Jules Wright, fell in love with it and is turning it into the Wapping Project Arts Centre. It's been a roller-coaster ride for our Miss Julie since she arrived with her husband, fleeing Australia and the draft, back in 1973. She was adopted by a family from a suburb of Adelaide called Birkenhead \"very much like the one in England\", she says. She was always a bright child: \"I was spoiled by my grandmother but sadly never knew my grandfather.\" He was George Grandison, Australian hero and first world war Victoria Cross winner.

Yet the date might have gone by unmarked had it not been for the promptings of a British academic, Joanne McNally, who wrote a paper three years ago noting that the anniversary was approaching and suggesting what might be done about it. In the end, academics from around the world flew to Berlin for a symposium, there was an exhibition on the first 15 years of cabaret and there was a live show with stars from all over Germany - yet the event was so strapped for cash that the performers gave their services free. What that shows us about Berlin, I suspect, is that its tourist authorities are unable to see what it is about the city that is of interest to others. What it shows about cabaret - or more correctly Kabarett - is that it has managed to keep a suitably uneasy relationship with the authorities and business. Authentic German cabaret is performed satire and the German language makes a clear distinction between Kabarett and cabaret - which takes in everything from variety shows to erotic spectacle. Kabarett can include stand-up comedy - jokes about the foreign minister Joschka Fischer's firebrand past were popular this week - sketches, song and dance and even poems. It has survived Nazism and Communism. In East Germany, where kabarett was immensely popular, performers were encouraged to poke fun at the west, but they also targeted their Communist masters - a dangerous pursuit during the cold war. There was even Kabarett in the concentration camps. Some of the best pre-war performers were Jewish, and sometimes shows were put on in an attempt to raise the morale of their fellow inmates.

Most people with personal pensions do not make the maximum contributions they are entitled to, perhaps because of cash flow problems or not having enough ready money for a lump-sum contribution. But in a year when you do have the extra cash for your pension you can make your maximum contribution and then make up six years of unused relief from past years.

Your pension will then follow a simple risk profile, which is traditionally equities when you are reasonably young and have little to lose, managed funds in middle age for more security, and the safety of gilts and cash in the run-up to retirement.

She is married with one son, and has homes in London and Wiltshire. What is your idea of perfect happiness? Walking through fields on a fresh day for as long as I want. What is your greatest fear? The dark. I've hated it since I was little. What vehicles do you own? A BMW tourer five series (whatever that means, but Wayne [her husband] assures me it's an important detail.)

      "body": "<p>Astute savers who in 1991 took advantage of John Major's invention while chancellor - the tax exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) - are now getting ready for some tasty returns.</p> <p>The gains are safe as well as being outside the income tax net, unlike many investments in stock market-related funds.</p> <p>But the returns already chalked up and the amount savers could get by reinvesting now vary immensely - it could be the difference between Gucci and the Grattans catalogue.</p> <p>According to a survey by HSBC Bank, 4m Tessa investors don't know the rules on reinvesting maturing funds and could lose the tax break if they do not reinvest their funds within six months of maturity.</p> <p>One way Tessa holders approaching maturity have to preserve the tax-free status of their investment is by putting their maturing funds into a Tessa-only Isa.</p> <p>One top-paying Tessa-only Isa that allows instant access to your money is available from Britannia building society, which currently pays 6.85% on a deposit of just \u00a31.</p> <p>The Northern Rock has a similar account paying 7.05% but savers have to give 30 days' notice to make a withdrawal. For savers with at least \u00a31,000 the Portman building society pays a fraction more at 7.3% but demands 45 days' notice.</p> <p>Maturing Tessa funds do not affect other tax-free Isas so investors are also entitled to save up to \u00a37,000 in a year in a stand-alone Isa. That means that someone with a Tessa maturing this year can stash up to \u00a316,000 away in tax-free savings.</p> <p>But with big gaps between best and the worst - smaller building societies have the best performance record - rolling over an old Tessa lets savers take a new, and penalty-free, look at where their money is deposited.</p> <p>Moving your Tessa to an alternative provider should be painless. Firstly withdraw your Tessa savings at maturity, asking your old bank to give you a cheque made payable to your new bank. And more importantly, ask your old bank for a Tessa maturity certificate, then go to the bank or building society where you want to open a new Tessa-only Isa.</p> <p>Once the capital - a maximum \u00a39,000 - has been reinvested, savers have to think about what to do with the interest, which cannot go into a Tessa replacement.</p> <p>One potential tax-free home is the mini cash Isa, where interest grows without any inland revenue involvement. This has a \u00a33,000 limit - roughly in line with the tax-free interest gained over the past five years in most Tessas.</p> <p>But there are drawbacks. You will not be able to take out a maxi Isa in that year, because under Isa rules you cannot hold a mini and a maxi Isa in the same tax year.</p> <p>But should you choose to invest in a Tessa-only Isa, you can still invest the maximum \u00a37,000 in a maxi stocks and shares-linked Isa.</p> <p>Mini cash Isa rules are more flexible than Tessas, which stipulated that you leave your capital untouched for five years. With an Isa, there is no such requirement, so you are free to withdraw your money as you wish.</p> <p>But remember that withdrawing cash has an impact on how much you can invest in the rest of the tax year. If you want to open a mini cash Isa, you have until April 5.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Astute savers who in 1991 took advantage of John Major's invention while chancellor - the tax exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) - are now getting ready for some tasty returns. The gains are safe as well as being outside the income tax net, unlike many investments in stock market-related funds. But the returns already chalked up and the amount savers could get by reinvesting now vary immensely - it could be the difference between Gucci and the Grattans catalogue. According to a survey by HSBC Bank, 4m Tessa investors don't know the rules on reinvesting maturing funds and could lose the tax break if they do not reinvest their funds within six months of maturity. One way Tessa holders approaching maturity have to preserve the tax-free status of their investment is by putting their maturing funds into a Tessa-only Isa. One top-paying Tessa-only Isa that allows instant access to your money is available from Britannia building society, which currently pays 6.85% on a deposit of just \u00a31. The Northern Rock has a similar account paying 7.05% but savers have to give 30 days' notice to make a withdrawal. For savers with at least \u00a31,000 the Portman building society pays a fraction more at 7.3% but demands 45 days' notice. Maturing Tessa funds do not affect other tax-free Isas so investors are also entitled to save up to \u00a37,000 in a year in a stand-alone Isa. That means that someone with a Tessa maturing this year can stash up to \u00a316,000 away in tax-free savings. But with big gaps between best and the worst - smaller building societies have the best performance record - rolling over an old Tessa lets savers take a new, and penalty-free, look at where their money is deposited. Moving your Tessa to an alternative provider should be painless. Firstly withdraw your Tessa savings at maturity, asking your old bank to give you a cheque made payable to your new bank. And more importantly, ask your old bank for a Tessa maturity certificate, then go to the bank or building society where you want to open a new Tessa-only Isa. Once the capital - a maximum \u00a39,000 - has been reinvested, savers have to think about what to do with the interest, which cannot go into a Tessa replacement. One potential tax-free home is the mini cash Isa, where interest grows without any inland revenue involvement. This has a \u00a33,000 limit - roughly in line with the tax-free interest gained over the past five years in most Tessas. But there are drawbacks. You will not be able to take out a maxi Isa in that year, because under Isa rules you cannot hold a mini and a maxi Isa in the same tax year. But should you choose to invest in a Tessa-only Isa, you can still invest the maximum \u00a37,000 in a maxi stocks and shares-linked Isa. Mini cash Isa rules are more flexible than Tessas, which stipulated that you leave your capital untouched for five years. With an Isa, there is no such requirement, so you are free to withdraw your money as you wish. But remember that withdrawing cash has an impact on how much you can invest in the rest of the tax year. If you want to open a mini cash Isa, you have until April 5.",

There is more dash than wood, of course - the fruit is balanced, subtly rich, finely acidic - and there's a wonderfully classy finish. Oddbins has it, as it does another fascinating white, <strong>Chateau de Nages Cuv\u00e9e Joseph Torres Blanc Costi\u00e8res de Nimes 1998 </strong>(16.5 points, \u00a36.99), which has a subtle, smoky edge and even some nice pale tannins.

Somerfield has <strong> Trivento Syrah 1999 </strong>(16 points, on offer at \u00a32.99 until January 30), from Argentina, which offers tannins, tension, fruit, style, and personality - at less than three quid, this is a minor masterpiece. <strong>Argentine Sangiovese 2000 </strong>(16.5 points, on offer at \u00a33.29 until January 30) is also superbly gluggable.</p> <p><strong>Montepulciano d'Abruzzo 1998 </strong>(14 points, on offer at \u00a32.99 until January 30) is a fruit-packed missile to throw at parties, as is the mildly lemony <strong>Vin de Pays des Chateaux de l'Ardeche Blanc 1999 </strong>(14.5 points, \u00a32.29 until January 30) - and, no, that \u00a32.29 is not a printing error. More substantial, on Somerfield's white side, is <strong>Argentine Chardonnay 1999 </strong> (16 points, on offer at \u00a33.29 until January 30), which has wonderfully rich, buttery fruit and an almost savoury depth. Somerfield also has <strong>Cono Sur Pinot Noir 1999 </strong>(16.5 points, \u00a34.99, also at Tesco and Asda), from Chile, which is extraordinary for the money.

      "body": "<p>'Six?!\" I said, incredulously. \"Six,\" he said, emphatically. \"Sounds dangerously populist, if you don't mind my saying so.\"</p> <p>\"Six.\"</p> <p>In spite of my protests, a meal consisting of three courses made up of dishes with no more than six ingredients each (although, none too generously, I was allowed not to count basics such as oils and seasoning in that number) was firmly on the agenda. My initial thoughts on this theme are pretty unprintable - after all, that number has more in common with the hairline of a child of the devil than good grub.</p> <p>Sure, great food is little more than a simple matter of good ingredients cooked well - inventive thought, quirk and novelty are best left in the hands of toy manufacturers - but the creation of teeny-weeny recipes that are supposed to have the cook in the kitchen for just 10 minutes yet still be able to produce a dinner that will knock your socks off are on the whole, and in the politest terms, a complete nonsense. Or so I huffed.</p> <p>Of course, there are some grand dishes with scant ingredients that do require only the minimum of preparation. A risotto of leeks, even using a stock cube, that hated lump of poison, takes 35-40 minutes to bring to fruition. Omelettes, on the other hand, are quick, yet curiously absent from daily life; the fact that they require a skill achieved through plenty of practice appears unworthy of mention - some chopped herbs, a little truffle, smoked haddock even, simply and elegantly accompany this greatly neglected dish.</p> <p>A little more thought can bring to mind other great dishes that require few ingredients and not much more effort than bending down at the oven now and again. To pop a roast in the oven requires little more than a good butcher and skill in timing. Liberal seasoning with sea salt and freshly ground pepper are all that is required, along with some roast potatoes, perhaps, and a salad. Hamburgers, likewise, spring to mind as a possibility, as do watercress soup, moules marini\u00e8res and fried fish . . .</p> <p>Gosh, now I come to think about it, there are loads of lovely dishes, all with six ingredients or fewer. So, to start, I think we'll have some prawns, not least because there is much satisfaction in peeling them and then leaving them to steep in bread and oil and a little garlic. That's it, more or less - all that's left is to skewer and grill them. Quite delicious, and delightfully free of quirk.</p> <p>It is an oddity that those countries, such as France or Italy, with many a grand cooking tradition also have a surfeit of sublimely simple one-course meals that may consist of nothing more than a few thin slices of cured meats, a bowl of olives, some bread and a bottle of wine; some cheese and fruit may feature, also, if you're going to push the boat out. Then again, in those countries you can, generally, buy very good stuff for such a feast, but it is difficult to pay dear old Blighty the same compliment, not least because the survival rates of a good butcher continue to plummet dramatically.</p> <p>That said, spare ribs do seem to be something of a constant, here, although they are generally reserved for a severe charring on a savage barbecue. When treated with a degree of respect, however, they become notable. And when made with the ribs of a superior breed of pig or cow, they are great.

Cook for about 40 minutes, turning the ribs from time to time, until their fleshiest part feels very tender when prodded with a fork and comes easily away from the bone.

      "bodyText": "'Six?!\" I said, incredulously. \"Six,\" he said, emphatically. \"Sounds dangerously populist, if you don't mind my saying so.\" \"Six.\" In spite of my protests, a meal consisting of three courses made up of dishes with no more than six ingredients each (although, none too generously, I was allowed not to count basics such as oils and seasoning in that number) was firmly on the agenda. My initial thoughts on this theme are pretty unprintable - after all, that number has more in common with the hairline of a child of the devil than good grub. Sure, great food is little more than a simple matter of good ingredients cooked well - inventive thought, quirk and novelty are best left in the hands of toy manufacturers - but the creation of teeny-weeny recipes that are supposed to have the cook in the kitchen for just 10 minutes yet still be able to produce a dinner that will knock your socks off are on the whole, and in the politest terms, a complete nonsense. Or so I huffed. Of course, there are some grand dishes with scant ingredients that do require only the minimum of preparation. A risotto of leeks, even using a stock cube, that hated lump of poison, takes 35-40 minutes to bring to fruition. Omelettes, on the other hand, are quick, yet curiously absent from daily life; the fact that they require a skill achieved through plenty of practice appears unworthy of mention - some chopped herbs, a little truffle, smoked haddock even, simply and elegantly accompany this greatly neglected dish. A little more thought can bring to mind other great dishes that require few ingredients and not much more effort than bending down at the oven now and again. To pop a roast in the oven requires little more than a good butcher and skill in timing. Liberal seasoning with sea salt and freshly ground pepper are all that is required, along with some roast potatoes, perhaps, and a salad. Hamburgers, likewise, spring to mind as a possibility, as do watercress soup, moules marini\u00e8res and fried fish . . . Gosh, now I come to think about it, there are loads of lovely dishes, all with six ingredients or fewer. So, to start, I think we'll have some prawns, not least because there is much satisfaction in peeling them and then leaving them to steep in bread and oil and a little garlic. That's it, more or less - all that's left is to skewer and grill them. Quite delicious, and delightfully free of quirk. It is an oddity that those countries, such as France or Italy, with many a grand cooking tradition also have a surfeit of sublimely simple one-course meals that may consist of nothing more than a few thin slices of cured meats, a bowl of olives, some bread and a bottle of wine; some cheese and fruit may feature, also, if you're going to push the boat out. Then again, in those countries you can, generally, buy very good stuff for such a feast, but it is difficult to pay dear old Blighty the same compliment, not least because the survival rates of a good butcher continue to plummet dramatically. That said, spare ribs do seem to be something of a constant, here, although they are generally reserved for a severe charring on a savage barbecue. When treated with a degree of respect, however, they become notable. And when made with the ribs of a superior breed of pig or cow, they are great. To accompany them, some mashed potatoes flavoured with Parmesan, which speak for themselves, and a salad, if desired. And for pudding? Oranges in a caramel-flavoured syrup are a refreshing and delicious finish, as well as simplicity itself to prepare. Such a meal makes a convincing argument for the delights of the simple approach. In this case, less is certainly more. As ever, the secret - how often do I say this? - lies in the quality of the raw materials. Even when they number only six, ingredients of top quality require minimum handling and embellishment, so long as this is done in a sympathetic manner. The results are revelatory - to me, at any rate. All recipes serve six. Grilled Prawn Skewers A great recipe from the great Marcella Hazan. The end result is a testament to keeping it simple. 900g plump prawns 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil 3 tbsp vegetable oil 75g fine, white breadcrumbs 2 cloves garlic, chopped very fine 2 tsp flat-leaf parsley, picked and chopped very fine Sea salt and black pepper Shell the prawns, but leave their tails on.

Especially if there are still a few things that you might have done differently... Dave Eggers looks back",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>\u0095 A Heartbreaking Work Of Staggering Genius was Dave Eggers' true, or almost all true, memoir of his life acting as quasi parent to his young brother, Toph, after their mother and father died. The book was an astonishing critical and popular success both in the US and in Britain. In the months following publication, Eggers has had time to mull over what he did, what he put in, what he left out, and respond to readers, admirers and naysayers. He has made a few changes to the original text for a new edition, but mostly what he has done is to add an extra chunk. These are some extracts from this latest instalment, Mistakes We Knew We Were Making. <br></p> <p>This appendix was supposed to, and almost did, accompany the original hardcover edition of the book. A version of it was nearly complete, when its author made the mistake of telling a writer friend about it, with, let's admit, a certain smugness. I was, I figured, the first to think of adding a corrective appendix to a nonfiction work, one meant to illuminate the many factual and temporal fudgings necessary to keep this, or really any, work of nonfiction from dragging around in arcana and endless explanations of who was exactly where, and when, etc. So: the corrective appendix was being prepared, and was to follow the original text, a few pages after the final \"finally\".</p> <p>But upon telling this writer-friend about the idea, she said, while looking much too ravishing over an open candle and with wet hair, \"Oh, right, like Mary McCarthy.\" There was, in the distance, the sound of thunder, and of lightning striking, presumably, a kitten. \"Um, what do you mean, pray tell, Just like Mary McCarthy?\" I thought, while, fear-stricken, managing only \"Huh?\" She noted that McCarthy had done almost the same thing in Memories Of A Catholic Girlhood, a book about which I was of course unware, because I am a moron. She explained that after each chapter recounting various episodes from McCarthy's youth, there was a slightly shorter chapter, set in italics, wherein the author dismantled the narrative, in favour of the unshaped truth.</p> <p>Each corrective chapter, the writer-friend pointed out, began with something like: Well, it didn't happen exactly that way... And this was exactly my goal in adding the appendix in the first place: it afforded the opportunity to be completely factual about things that in the narrative had to be compressed or altered slightly so the book could continue apace. But after this illuminating dinner, I sought and found a copy of McCarthy's book (paperback edition with horrific cover), and after reading McCarthy's perfect execution of the idea, I abandoned my own appendix, not wanting to invest too much in a notion already used. And besides, I felt, the stupid goddamn book was obviously long enough. Thus, about 40 pages of prime appendix were scrapped. But now, about eight brutal and then exhilarating and then more-brutal-than-before months after the book was originally published, I've gone ahead and finished the appendix, for better or worse.</p> <p><b>Many names have been changed </b><br></p> <p>Yes, and I've taken out the phone numbers, too. Writing the first edition, I placed much weight on employing as many real names as possible, using their actual working phone numbers, everything, to prove a point that one could be completely factual, and still tell a story that felt and read novelistic, somewhat timeless, at least fluid. Changing all the names or, worse, making it all fictional (semi-autobiographical) seemed cowardly and silly. And so before publication I approached people whose names were used, and asked their permission. All readily agreed, but now, many of the people who initially said yes have had second thoughts. A typical conversation before publication: \"Is it okay to use your real name?\" \"Sure, why not?\" Typical conversation a month after publication: \"Would it be possible to remove my name?\" \"Of course. Why?\" \"Well, no offence, but I really didn't think anyone would see the damn book.\"</p> <p>A slightly different thing happened with the three friends who allowed the usage of their phone numbers. I assumed that after a few months, those whose numbers were listed would have been so besieged by creative teenagers at sleepovers that they'd have to change their numbers, a service I promised to pay for. And yet: approximate number of copies of this book sold in hardcover form: 200,000; approximate number of readers of this book, considering library use and pass-along: maybe 400,000; thus, how weird is this: Number of calls Marny received: 7 Number of calls Kirsten received: 12 Total calls for KC: 5 Total number of calls: 24. Those that did call often hung up; those that spoke were very nice. But overall, a remarkable thing: a gaspingly low percentage of phoners, especially given just how easy and convenient telephone use can be.</p> <p>My guess is that a majority of people either a) assumed the numbers were phoney or outdated; b) were exceedingly polite and respectful of the privacy of nonfictional book characters; or c) never actually made it that far into the book, a failure for which I cast no outward blame. The fault, of course, is mine. Why, then, have we changed most of the names in the book? Because I've lost my taste for this sort of courage. I thought it was courageous to write about these things, and I thought it was equally courageous for my friends and me to use our names and phone numbers, and to allow our exploits and sexploits to be recounted in print for the consumption of our parents and aunts and nephews.</p> <p>But now, when so many have asked for name-changes, and so many have been shocked by who/how many have seen all these words, I've decided to let most of the people - save some primary characters - breathe easier and live freer, by allowing them to slip back into semi-fictional personae. In a few cases, where I had originally lashed out at real people in backhanded ways, and used their real names in doing so, I have removed or softened these parts, because in the last year I've also, almost completely, lost my taste for blood.</p> <p>One of the things that mercifully isn't covered in the book is the author's truly iffy and semi-brief career as a cartoonist. For the entire time covered in the book, I was doing a weekly cartoon for SF Weekly, a newspaper published a few blocks from the offices of Might [a magazine Eggers and some friends were producing in San Francisco]. The cartoon, as Might did, sought to engage its readers, to provoke interaction, however glancing, and thus had an abiding curiosity in how people would react to solicitations placed within its clumsily rendered borders.</p> <p>Accordingly, one of its favourite experiments involved the giving away of the original artwork used in the cartoon, via the trunk of my car. At the time, after our Civic was crushed by the SUV en route to my sister's Kiss-featuring wedding, we bought a 1972 BMW 2002, a truly funny and perfect car, coloured chartreuse. And so I made an offer to the readers, that if they should see the car parked on any city street, that they should open the trunk, which would be unlocked always, and inside they would find drawings used in published cartoons. They could take a drawing, sign a register indicating who they were and what they took, and then they could go on their way, merrily. It worked. In a few weeks, all the artwork was gone, and everyone had signed their names.</p> <p>So then, drunk on trust, I started leaving not only the trunk open but all the cars' doors unlocked. And in about six months of this, never was anything stolen or the car other-wise molested, outside of the pollution littered under the car's windshield wipers by the city's vigilant and efficient and completely evil meter maids, venal and carnivorous people in ridiculous helmets, may they and their overlords all burn in Hell eternally with much crackling and bubbling and searing of melted flesh. The point is that trust is usually rewarded, even though trust is sometimes violated, horribly. Trust is fun. It is fun to trust strangers. It is fun to risk what you can reasonably risk - like, your car, or your reputation - on the trust of people you know only through something ephemeral shared, something like taste in books or cartoons, or having watched people suffer.</p> <p><b>The kayak trip </b><br></p> <p>Also removed was a fantastic scene - 100 per cent true - featuring most of the book's primary characters, and a whale. We had been given a chance to try out, for free, a new hearty tourist's tour - a kayak trip around Angel Island. It's hilly, heavily forested but, since the early 1900s - when it served as sort of a West Coast Ellis Island - an uninhabited and largely uneventful rock, dumped in the middle of San Francisco Bay. Asserting our freedom to leave the office on any day or at any time, four of us from work went at noon, took a ferry from Fisherman's Wharf and once at the island, we paired up: Marny and I in one kayak, Moodie and Zev in another. The guide, in a single-seater, rounded out the party, and we set out. The guide's name was not Bart, but we will be calling him Bart. Ocean kayaking is very often very boring. Whereas whitewater kayaking has built-in interest, involving foam and speed enjoyed without having to self-generate that speed, ocean kayaking (which is essentially what a Bay kayak trip is) is akin to cross-country skiing - the pace is slow, the sights are unchanging and the work is tedious. And speed, really the only reason to partake in any sport, is almost impossible to achieve to any satisfactory degree.</p> <p>The day was blue and yellow, and there was no wind. About halfway around the island, my shoulders already hurt like a mother; I was having some kind of rotator cuff problem. Naturally I thought of Jim McMahon [American footballer] and his own rotator cuff problems. Then thought of his headbands. And his part in The Super Bowl Shuffle, the now-wildly underrated football anthem from 1984. Then of Walter Payton, easily one of the most graceful athletes in any sport ever, in whose body cancer was already taking root, growing, planning expansion, sprawling, though no one yet knew it.</p> <p>Then. There! About a thousand yards into the Bay, toward the city, a sudden plume of steam, coming from a shiny grey-black sliver rounded over the water's surface. A whale. Fuck me, a whale, someone said. Almost surely someone said that. Then it disappeared. Then someone said: Holy shit. Then: Jesus fuck. We paddled furiously toward it, making our way to the site of breach, and when we got there, we waited. It was silly, really: we knew the whale was gone, so to look for it in the precise location it had appeared would assume that it was just bobbing in place, below us, which of course it was not. Whales do not bob in place; whales are on the move, whales have places to go. But still we waited, because we are dumb people who do dumb things.</p> <p>It was bright. The city was white to our left, and the ocean was straight ahead, a few miles west. The water was still, and we rested our paddles on the kayaks. Our legs were underwater but dry. Our faces were getting burned. We took handfuls of the Bay's cold and wet our faces and our necks. We scanned the surface for a break. Then: it came up again, this time about 500 yards toward the ocean. Same plume, same huge grey-black back breaking the surface, turning like a slow, dull bandsaw. Goddamn, someone said. Again we sped toward the location of its last appearance. Bart was excited. Bart had been kayaking in the Bay for years and years, and had never seen anything like this, a whale, in person, not 500 yards away. We arrived where we had last seen it: nothing. We felt stupid again, but less stupid than before: maybe he, the whale, knew we were here, watching him; maybe our chasing him had induced his second appearance. Whales are smart, and if whales are smart, surely they enjoy these kinds of chasing games, as do all smart animals, like dogs, and dolphins, and many others I could name but will not, including those known as pigs, a kind of animal which everyone claims is smart, without any impressive behavioural evidence to back it up.</p> <p>So we waited. Three, five minutes. Then, into the Bay, again: the plume, the back, holy Jesus. A third appearance, this time 300 yards from its last. We didn't know what to do: follow it again? Just wait for the next breach? Wouldn't we have a better chance of a close-up visit if we stayed put? We decided to paddle halfway toward it, and then wait. We did, and once there, we put our paddles down, exhausted. My rotator cuff ached. I thought of Jim McMahon again. And then of Jim McMahon's sunglasses, which were big, and wrapped around his head - in the early 80s, a new and mysterious thing. Who was he playing for now? Was he still so intriguingly rebellious? We were in the middle of the Bay, a few inches out of the water, on a blue and yellow day, and we were chasing a whale. We looked at each other and grinned. But we were tired. We were tired, and were thinking that we really should get moving, toward the beach, where we planned to have our lunch.</p> <p>We were arranged like this [the guide nearest the last sighting of the whale, one kayak parallell with him and the other bridging the other two kayaks, looking like a kayak stonehenge]: Again we waited. This time about 10 minutes. We were content, because we were tired, and because we were already satisfied, having seen a whale, while kayaking, in the Bay, near our homes, in our city, on a clear day while we were young.</p> <p>Now. See the \"x\"? [The \"x\" is between the two parallell kayaks] That's where the motherfucker came up. He surfaced right between us. Not three feet away from our kayak. Much closer to Bart's. More than close. It was under Bart's kayak, not just under it but under it in such a way that when it surfaced, Bart's kayak was on top of the whale. It scared the piss out of us. I yelped. Everyone else made more civilised sounds. Gasps. I thought the whale might eat us. Then Bart, God bless him, while he was being lifted from the water by this 40ft monster, had the presence of mind to reach down and touch it. The whale - God, thinking about it now, it seems like it was there, between us all, for hours - it had this big dull eye, and the eye was looking at us, and the whale's whole back was bumped and barnacled, a thousand years old, and his mouth could have crushed us all, toothless though, the thing hardly an animal and more like a huge rough rock, a big rubbery rock rolling under us... And then it sunk from under Bart's kayak, setting the kayak's shiny fibreglass bottom back upon the surface, and in a second it was gone.</p> <p>And right then, if I was ever unsure of it before, I was certain that we had been marked. When a whale surfaces between your kayaks - chooses, among any of 2 or 3 million places in a Bay to breach, chooses a spot between your tiny plastic kayaks - this giant ancient creature, who very well might be some kind of alien, a billion years old and maybe the creator of the whole world and everything in it (why not?), has come from the blue-grey depths to terrify you - that means everything is possible. No one can need more proof than that.</p> <p>\u0095 Read part two of this article <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,425167,00.html\"> here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 A Heartbreaking Work Of Staggering Genius was Dave Eggers' true, or almost all true, memoir of his life acting as quasi parent to his young brother, Toph, after their mother and father died. The book was an astonishing critical and popular success both in the US and in Britain. In the months following publication, Eggers has had time to mull over what he did, what he put in, what he left out, and respond to readers, admirers and naysayers. He has made a few changes to the original text for a new edition, but mostly what he has done is to add an extra chunk. These are some extracts from this latest instalment, Mistakes We Knew We Were Making. This appendix was supposed to, and almost did, accompany the original hardcover edition of the book. A version of it was nearly complete, when its author made the mistake of telling a writer friend about it, with, let's admit, a certain smugness. I was, I figured, the first to think of adding a corrective appendix to a nonfiction work, one meant to illuminate the many factual and temporal fudgings necessary to keep this, or really any, work of nonfiction from dragging around in arcana and endless explanations of who was exactly where, and when, etc. So: the corrective appendix was being prepared, and was to follow the original text, a few pages after the final \"finally\". But upon telling this writer-friend about the idea, she said, while looking much too ravishing over an open candle and with wet hair, \"Oh, right, like Mary McCarthy.\" There was, in the distance, the sound of thunder, and of lightning striking, presumably, a kitten. \"Um, what do you mean, pray tell, Just like Mary McCarthy?\" I thought, while, fear-stricken, managing only \"Huh?\" She noted that McCarthy had done almost the same thing in Memories Of A Catholic Girlhood, a book about which I was of course unware, because I am a moron. She explained that after each chapter recounting various episodes from McCarthy's youth, there was a slightly shorter chapter, set in italics, wherein the author dismantled the narrative, in favour of the unshaped truth. Each corrective chapter, the writer-friend pointed out, began with something like: Well, it didn't happen exactly that way... And this was exactly my goal in adding the appendix in the first place: it afforded the opportunity to be completely factual about things that in the narrative had to be compressed or altered slightly so the book could continue apace. But after this illuminating dinner, I sought and found a copy of McCarthy's book (paperback edition with horrific cover), and after reading McCarthy's perfect execution of the idea, I abandoned my own appendix, not wanting to invest too much in a notion already used. And besides, I felt, the stupid goddamn book was obviously long enough. Thus, about 40 pages of prime appendix were scrapped. But now, about eight brutal and then exhilarating and then more-brutal-than-before months after the book was originally published, I've gone ahead and finished the appendix, for better or worse. Many names have been changed Yes, and I've taken out the phone numbers, too. Writing the first edition, I placed much weight on employing as many real names as possible, using their actual working phone numbers, everything, to prove a point that one could be completely factual, and still tell a story that felt and read novelistic, somewhat timeless, at least fluid. Changing all the names or, worse, making it all fictional (semi-autobiographical) seemed cowardly and silly. And so before publication I approached people whose names were used, and asked their permission. All readily agreed, but now, many of the people who initially said yes have had second thoughts. A typical conversation before publication: \"Is it okay to use your real name?\" \"Sure, why not?\" Typical conversation a month after publication: \"Would it be possible to remove my name?\" \"Of course. Why?\" \"Well, no offence, but I really didn't think anyone would see the damn book.\" A slightly different thing happened with the three friends who allowed the usage of their phone numbers. I assumed that after a few months, those whose numbers were listed would have been so besieged by creative teenagers at sleepovers that they'd have to change their numbers, a service I promised to pay for. And yet: approximate number of copies of this book sold in hardcover form: 200,000; approximate number of readers of this book, considering library use and pass-along: maybe 400,000; thus, how weird is this: Number of calls Marny received: 7 Number of calls Kirsten received: 12 Total calls for KC: 5 Total number of calls: 24. Those that did call often hung up; those that spoke were very nice. But overall, a remarkable thing: a gaspingly low percentage of phoners, especially given just how easy and convenient telephone use can be. My guess is that a majority of people either a) assumed the numbers were phoney or outdated; b) were exceedingly polite and respectful of the privacy of nonfictional book characters; or c) never actually made it that far into the book, a failure for which I cast no outward blame. The fault, of course, is mine. Why, then, have we changed most of the names in the book? Because I've lost my taste for this sort of courage. I thought it was courageous to write about these things, and I thought it was equally courageous for my friends and me to use our names and phone numbers, and to allow our exploits and sexploits to be recounted in print for the consumption of our parents and aunts and nephews. But now, when so many have asked for name-changes, and so many have been shocked by who/how many have seen all these words, I've decided to let most of the people - save some primary characters - breathe easier and live freer, by allowing them to slip back into semi-fictional personae. In a few cases, where I had originally lashed out at real people in backhanded ways, and used their real names in doing so, I have removed or softened these parts, because in the last year I've also, almost completely, lost my taste for blood.

      "body": "<p>Steady rain and sleet, and even snow, are forecast for George Bush's presidential inauguration today in Washington. But even a blanket of winter weather cannot conceal the profound change of political and cultural direction in the capital as Mr Bush moves into the White House at the start of his four-year term.</p> <p>Officials were considering whether the forecast storms would be bad enough to require them to move Mr Bush's swearing-in ceremony inside the Capitol building, before fewer than 1,000 guests. The last time that happened was Ronald Reagan's second inauguration in 1985.</p> <p>Mr Bush told an interviewer yesterday that he was \"not backing off\" from his conservative political convictions. He had a blunt message for Democrats in the divided US Congress: They should work with the new administration \"or they're going to be left behind\".</p> <p>To those who believe that he \"stole\" the November 2000 election and is not entitled to appoint conservatives such as the putative attorney general, John Ashcroft, to his cabinet, he had an equally brusque response. \"Too bad,\" he told Fox television. \"I'm going to.\"</p> <p>As Washington geared up for the change of regime, which will come at midday when the chief justice, William Rehnquist, administers the oath of office, a federal judge ruled that thousands of protesters must submit to unprecedented security checks before gaining access to streets in the centre of Washington. Some 750,000 people had been expected in the city centre before the weather took a hand.</p> <p>The outward signs of the new regime are everywhere to be seen in the capital, nevertheless. Airports reported record numbers of private jets arriving in town, delaying commercial flights into Washington by up to three hours. Every stretch limo on the eastern seaboard is parked outside the city's hotels, and Stetsons and snakeskin boots are visible at every turn.</p> <p>Mr Bush was guest of honour at a succession of candlelight dinners last night for more than 6,000 supporters who each contributed more than $2,500 to the $40m inaugural budget. He and his wife Laura were due to end the evening at the \"Texas black tie and boots\" ball costing $1.8m.</p> <p>Every presidential inauguration tells a story of how the new man would like to be seen. Jimmy Carter refused to take the limo down Pennsylvania Avenue and walked to the door of the White House. Ronald Reagan, surrounded himself with Hollywood ostentation, implicitly proclaiming the opening of the \"greed is good\" decade.</p> <p>Bill Clinton's inaugural festivities, eight years ago, marked the arrival of the rock 'n' roll generation in the seats of power. Chuck Berry played guitar, Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen sang and Mr Clinton joined in, riffing on the sax in his shades, marking the arrival of the first hedonist in the White House.</p> <p>The aesthetics of Mr Bush's inaugural celebrations have been more ambiguous. These have been days of partying in Washington, but the relatively subdued tone, compared with earlier transitions, is an unmistakeable reminder of the circumstances in which the new president is taking office. Mr Bush's low key message is that the important thing is to get on with the job.</p> <p>Two years ago, the appearance of the Latino star Ricky Martin at an inaugural event would have appeared a very Bush-like statement about ethnic inclusiveness, This week it seemed merely middle of the road. Yesterday's concert in Washington \"celebrating US youth\" featured a succession of B-list acts. The celeb factor for this inaugural event is one of the lowest on record.</p> <p>Many Republicans are relaxed with the absence of Really Big Names from the inaugural weekend concerts and balls. Hollywood is Clintonland these days, so the Bush people affect disdain for the celeb worship which became a hallmark of the outgoing era. When Frank Sinatra orchestrated the entertainment industry celebs' parade for Mr Reagan 20 years ago, on the other hand, Republicans had no such scruples.</p> <p>The public events in Washington this weekend have also had their disingenuous side. Early reports said that the British stand-up comic Ben Elton would appear. The thought of the leftie Ben as part of a Bush lineup seemed hard to believe, and so it proved. He never showed up, because he was never going to.</p> <p>Nor did Van Morrison, who had been improbably touted as part of the Bush celebrations. \"Reports that Van Morrison will be performing or attending the inauguration ceremonies are false,\" said a press release from his record company.</p> <p><b>Star turns</b></p> <p>The celebrities who entertained presidents:</p> <p><b>Bush era: </b>Ricky Martin, Marie Osmond, ZZ Top</p> <p><b>Clinton era:</b> Bruce Springsteen, Chuck Berry, Stevie Wonder</p> <p><b>Reagan era:</b> Frank Sinatra, Donny Osmond, Sylvester Stallone</p>",

      "bodyText": "Steady rain and sleet, and even snow, are forecast for George Bush's presidential inauguration today in Washington. But even a blanket of winter weather cannot conceal the profound change of political and cultural direction in the capital as Mr Bush moves into the White House at the start of his four-year term. Officials were considering whether the forecast storms would be bad enough to require them to move Mr Bush's swearing-in ceremony inside the Capitol building, before fewer than 1,000 guests. The last time that happened was Ronald Reagan's second inauguration in 1985. Mr Bush told an interviewer yesterday that he was \"not backing off\" from his conservative political convictions. He had a blunt message for Democrats in the divided US Congress: They should work with the new administration \"or they're going to be left behind\". To those who believe that he \"stole\" the November 2000 election and is not entitled to appoint conservatives such as the putative attorney general, John Ashcroft, to his cabinet, he had an equally brusque response. \"Too bad,\" he told Fox television. \"I'm going to.\" As Washington geared up for the change of regime, which will come at midday when the chief justice, William Rehnquist, administers the oath of office, a federal judge ruled that thousands of protesters must submit to unprecedented security checks before gaining access to streets in the centre of Washington. Some 750,000 people had been expected in the city centre before the weather took a hand. The outward signs of the new regime are everywhere to be seen in the capital, nevertheless. Airports reported record numbers of private jets arriving in town, delaying commercial flights into Washington by up to three hours. Every stretch limo on the eastern seaboard is parked outside the city's hotels, and Stetsons and snakeskin boots are visible at every turn. Mr Bush was guest of honour at a succession of candlelight dinners last night for more than 6,000 supporters who each contributed more than $2,500 to the $40m inaugural budget. He and his wife Laura were due to end the evening at the \"Texas black tie and boots\" ball costing $1.8m. Every presidential inauguration tells a story of how the new man would like to be seen. Jimmy Carter refused to take the limo down Pennsylvania Avenue and walked to the door of the White House. Ronald Reagan, surrounded himself with Hollywood ostentation, implicitly proclaiming the opening of the \"greed is good\" decade. Bill Clinton's inaugural festivities, eight years ago, marked the arrival of the rock 'n' roll generation in the seats of power. Chuck Berry played guitar, Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen sang and Mr Clinton joined in, riffing on the sax in his shades, marking the arrival of the first hedonist in the White House. The aesthetics of Mr Bush's inaugural celebrations have been more ambiguous. These have been days of partying in Washington, but the relatively subdued tone, compared with earlier transitions, is an unmistakeable reminder of the circumstances in which the new president is taking office. Mr Bush's low key message is that the important thing is to get on with the job. Two years ago, the appearance of the Latino star Ricky Martin at an inaugural event would have appeared a very Bush-like statement about ethnic inclusiveness, This week it seemed merely middle of the road. Yesterday's concert in Washington \"celebrating US youth\" featured a succession of B-list acts. The celeb factor for this inaugural event is one of the lowest on record. Many Republicans are relaxed with the absence of Really Big Names from the inaugural weekend concerts and balls. Hollywood is Clintonland these days, so the Bush people affect disdain for the celeb worship which became a hallmark of the outgoing era. When Frank Sinatra orchestrated the entertainment industry celebs' parade for Mr Reagan 20 years ago, on the other hand, Republicans had no such scruples. The public events in Washington this weekend have also had their disingenuous side. Early reports said that the British stand-up comic Ben Elton would appear. The thought of the leftie Ben as part of a Bush lineup seemed hard to believe, and so it proved. He never showed up, because he was never going to. Nor did Van Morrison, who had been improbably touted as part of the Bush celebrations. \"Reports that Van Morrison will be performing or attending the inauguration ceremonies are false,\" said a press release from his record company. Star turns The celebrities who entertained presidents: Bush era: Ricky Martin, Marie Osmond, ZZ Top Clinton era: Bruce Springsteen, Chuck Berry, Stevie Wonder Reagan era: Frank Sinatra, Donny Osmond, Sylvester Stallone",

UK investment trusts failed lamentably to foresee the 10-year record boom in the US stock market and economy, with software and other technology to the fore. Previously they achieved best returns when investing overseas benefited from the weakness of sterling. Performance in Japan and most emerging markets has often been disastrous, but Europe became a fruitful scene a few years ago. Finding growth leaders throughout the world, particularly in stable western economies, is the proper target of established funds.",

Migration to the Brazilian Amazon has led to a big rise in its population over the last century to about 12m, according to provisional figures. \"We cannot leave the local population living in a glass bowl just for the benefit of rainforest preservation,\" said Jose Paulo Silveira of the department of planning and strategic investments. \"We need to keep on developing.\" He added that there was no intention to build new roads, just to improve existing ones: \"We accept suggestions, but I don't entirely trust the precision of the study because of the data it used - some of which is out of date.\" The Science report suggests the industrialisation is shortsighted because Brazil could lose up to \u00a31.4bn a year in selling carbon credits - a practice which allows countries to meet pollution reduction targets by buying the unused quotas of other nations. Mr Cochrane said deforestation was more subtle than the levelling of whole areas. \"When you view these forests from a distance they look OK, but when you stand in them, you can see they've been thinned, and that they've changed,\" he said. \"It's like they have holes punched in them. These holes can make a rainforest dry out.\" Roads once confined to the Amazon's perimeter are now penetrating to its heart, bringing people that further stress the forest, he said. \"Unfortunately, there is little government control in the Amazonian frontier,\" added Mr Laurance. \"Illegal logging and land-clearing are rampant. New roads that cut into the frontier almost always initiate a process of spontaneous colonisation, logging, hunting and land speculation that is almost impossible to stop.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A taxpayer who was bankrupted for his failure to pay an alleged \u00a338,000 tax bill last week saw the final cost of his dispute with the Inland Revenue rise to \u00a3127,000 after the government and the accountants handling the case added their charges.</p> <p>Patrick Cullinane says he was distraught when he learned that the costs of the bankruptcy had more than trebled, leaving him penniless. Mr Cullinane was made bankrupt in 1996 after a decade-long battle with the Inland Revenue. The City firm of accountants KPMG were appointed to oversee the liquidation of his only asset, a three-bedroom house in north London, in order to pay the claimed debt.</p> <p>After several attempts to stop the repossession of his home he was thrown out in March 1999. The house was sold for \u00a3127,000 with a \u00a322,000 mortgage with the Abbey National bank still outstanding. That rose by \u00a34,000 over 15 years.</p> <p>The mortgage was repaid out of the sale funds. Eighteen months later he discovered that a raft of other costs including the estate agency commission on the sale of his house, VAT, other taxes, bailiffs' bills and a near \u00a340,000 invoice from KPMG had eaten away the rest of the money. Ironically, the Inland Revenue received just over \u00a318,000, less than half what it wanted.</p> <p>Mr Cullinane hoped to continue his fight against the Revenue with any funds remaining from his bankruptcy. When he was told the costs of settling the debts had soared and wiped out the remaining funds, he was devastated. \"It is outrageous that they have taken away everything I have. I must now carry on living with my sister and I have no money to employ a lawyer to fight my case.\"</p> <p>The Official Receiver, which oversees bankruptcies on behalf of the government, said in a letter to the two creditors that the case was simple and considered managing the bankruptcy itself. But it allowed KPMG to take on the task instead. With the agreement of the Revenue, KPMG was allowed to make its own charges rather than stick to the Official Receiver's scale of charges, which are considerably lower.</p> <p>The Inland Revenue, the only active creditor, said in a statement it was standard practice to use KPMG, commonly called one of the Big Five accountancy firms: \"KPMG and its insolvency practitioners are well respected and there is nothing unusual in their appointment as trustee in bankruptcy in this case.\"</p> <p>The dispute began in 1983 when Mr Cullinane was a stage hand working in the film industry. He attempted to claim back income tax after taking a job where he was put on the emergency tax rate. But instead of receiving a tidy lump sum at the end of the tax year he became the subject of an investigation by a local tax inspector.</p> <p>He employed an accountant to establish why the Inland Revenue had a problem, but he failed to make much headway. After three years Mr Cullinane could no longer afford to pay accountancy fees. Then, in 1990, the Special Commissioners, who act as a court for tax disputes, were presented with evidence by the Inland Revenue that he had failed to declare rental income from tenants staying in his house on his tax returns. It said an extra kitchen and bathroom had been built for the purpose of renting the property.</p> <p>Mr Cullinane has denied the charges, saying that income he received was money owed by a previous employer and social security payments.

      "bodyText": "A taxpayer who was bankrupted for his failure to pay an alleged \u00a338,000 tax bill last week saw the final cost of his dispute with the Inland Revenue rise to \u00a3127,000 after the government and the accountants handling the case added their charges. Patrick Cullinane says he was distraught when he learned that the costs of the bankruptcy had more than trebled, leaving him penniless. Mr Cullinane was made bankrupt in 1996 after a decade-long battle with the Inland Revenue. The City firm of accountants KPMG were appointed to oversee the liquidation of his only asset, a three-bedroom house in north London, in order to pay the claimed debt. After several attempts to stop the repossession of his home he was thrown out in March 1999. The house was sold for \u00a3127,000 with a \u00a322,000 mortgage with the Abbey National bank still outstanding. That rose by \u00a34,000 over 15 years. The mortgage was repaid out of the sale funds. Eighteen months later he discovered that a raft of other costs including the estate agency commission on the sale of his house, VAT, other taxes, bailiffs' bills and a near \u00a340,000 invoice from KPMG had eaten away the rest of the money. Ironically, the Inland Revenue received just over \u00a318,000, less than half what it wanted. Mr Cullinane hoped to continue his fight against the Revenue with any funds remaining from his bankruptcy. When he was told the costs of settling the debts had soared and wiped out the remaining funds, he was devastated. \"It is outrageous that they have taken away everything I have. I must now carry on living with my sister and I have no money to employ a lawyer to fight my case.\" The Official Receiver, which oversees bankruptcies on behalf of the government, said in a letter to the two creditors that the case was simple and considered managing the bankruptcy itself. But it allowed KPMG to take on the task instead. With the agreement of the Revenue, KPMG was allowed to make its own charges rather than stick to the Official Receiver's scale of charges, which are considerably lower. The Inland Revenue, the only active creditor, said in a statement it was standard practice to use KPMG, commonly called one of the Big Five accountancy firms: \"KPMG and its insolvency practitioners are well respected and there is nothing unusual in their appointment as trustee in bankruptcy in this case.\" The dispute began in 1983 when Mr Cullinane was a stage hand working in the film industry. He attempted to claim back income tax after taking a job where he was put on the emergency tax rate. But instead of receiving a tidy lump sum at the end of the tax year he became the subject of an investigation by a local tax inspector. He employed an accountant to establish why the Inland Revenue had a problem, but he failed to make much headway. After three years Mr Cullinane could no longer afford to pay accountancy fees. Then, in 1990, the Special Commissioners, who act as a court for tax disputes, were presented with evidence by the Inland Revenue that he had failed to declare rental income from tenants staying in his house on his tax returns. It said an extra kitchen and bathroom had been built for the purpose of renting the property. Mr Cullinane has denied the charges, saying that income he received was money owed by a previous employer and social security payments. He had only one kitchen and bathroom, he says. Despite his denials, the Revenue pressed ahead with a bankruptcy order to recover the tax. It has subsequently conceded that all the money going through Mr Cullinane's bank account was either taxed at source or not liable for tax, but maintains that he must have received rental income by other means. Mr Cullinane has attempted on several occasions to force the Revenue to disclose what evidence there is to support this assertion, but it has so far refused. The Taxpayers Charter has proved little help in his campaign to view his tax file. Mr Cullinane's supporters have even offered to pay the Revenue any administration costs it might incur collecting the information, but to no avail.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A new type of mortgage deal where people pool their buying power to get a cheaper rate was launched this week.</p> <p>\"Bulk-buy\" home loans are the brainchild of mortgage broker Charcol. How they work is that the more people who apply, the lower the rate you'll pay. Charcol this week unveiled its first three bulk-buy mortgages - a two-year discounted rate loan, a two-year fixed rate, and a flexible fixed rate aimed at people looking to remortgage.</p> <p>Teaming up with other people in order to drive down costs has obvious attractions, but it's fair to say that the concept of collective buying hasn't exactly set the retail world alight so far. The best-known player in this field is online retailer LetsBuyIt.com - whose advertising campaign features ants - which has run into highly-publicised financial difficulties.</p> <p>The company's business model won praise but in the end it wasn't able to deliver the goods. Perhaps it's simply because most of us prefer to browse in shops and showrooms when buying products LetsBuyIt.com has specialised in, such as electrical items and toys. But some experts argue that less tangible products such as mortgages and pensions lend themselves much better to collective buying over the net or phone.</p> <p>Charcol isn't too fazed by LetsBuyIt.com's woes and is confident that bulk-buy mortgages will be a hit. All three of its new mortgages work in the same way: each offers what it says is a \"market leading\" rate even before any reductions are made or benefits added. Each time the number of people applying for the deals passes a set level the rate is cut slightly or an extra perk is added.</p> <p>After two weeks (or if the mortgage sells out before then), provided enough people have applied, everyone gets the mortgage at the discounted rate. There is an upfront \u00a349 reservation fee but you can pull out and have this refunded if you decide not to proceed because not enough people have signed up. People will be able to check levels of take-up by logging on to <a href=\"http://www.charcolonline.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Charcol Online</a>.</p> <p>The first three deals are:</p> <p>\u0095 A loan giving 2.55% off the standard variable rate for the first year and a 2.45% discount in the second year (giving an initial rate of 5.19% and then 5.29%) from Birm ingham Midshires. The deal is available to those with a deposit of 5%-plus, but there is a \u00a3299 arrangement fee and early redemption penalties for the first two years. Provided enough people come forward, the discount in the second year will be upped to 2.5% and up to \u00a3400 cashback will be thrown in.</p> <p>\u0095 A loan fixed at 5.45% for two years for those able to stump up a deposit of at least 25%, or 5.65% for those who can only manage a 10% deposit. The lender is GMAC, the loans business owned by General Motors. There is a \u00a3295 arrangement fee and no redemption penalties. The bulk-buy enhancements would see the rates cut to 5.39%/5.59% and up to \u00a3385 of cashback provided.</p> <p>\u0095 A flexible deal only open to people remortgaging, fixed at 5.59% for two years, funded by the Woolwich. You need a deposit of 10%-plus, and there is no arrangement fee, but there are redemption penalties within the two years. The perks, provided enough people apply, include up to \u00a3650 cashback.</p> <p>Charcol says that as the service develops it plans to offer a range of bulk-buy deals.

      "bodyText": "A new type of mortgage deal where people pool their buying power to get a cheaper rate was launched this week. \"Bulk-buy\" home loans are the brainchild of mortgage broker Charcol. How they work is that the more people who apply, the lower the rate you'll pay. Charcol this week unveiled its first three bulk-buy mortgages - a two-year discounted rate loan, a two-year fixed rate, and a flexible fixed rate aimed at people looking to remortgage. Teaming up with other people in order to drive down costs has obvious attractions, but it's fair to say that the concept of collective buying hasn't exactly set the retail world alight so far. The best-known player in this field is online retailer LetsBuyIt.com - whose advertising campaign features ants - which has run into highly-publicised financial difficulties. The company's business model won praise but in the end it wasn't able to deliver the goods. Perhaps it's simply because most of us prefer to browse in shops and showrooms when buying products LetsBuyIt.com has specialised in, such as electrical items and toys. But some experts argue that less tangible products such as mortgages and pensions lend themselves much better to collective buying over the net or phone. Charcol isn't too fazed by LetsBuyIt.com's woes and is confident that bulk-buy mortgages will be a hit. All three of its new mortgages work in the same way: each offers what it says is a \"market leading\" rate even before any reductions are made or benefits added. Each time the number of people applying for the deals passes a set level the rate is cut slightly or an extra perk is added. After two weeks (or if the mortgage sells out before then), provided enough people have applied, everyone gets the mortgage at the discounted rate. There is an upfront \u00a349 reservation fee but you can pull out and have this refunded if you decide not to proceed because not enough people have signed up. People will be able to check levels of take-up by logging on to Charcol Online. The first three deals are: \u0095 A loan giving 2.55% off the standard variable rate for the first year and a 2.45% discount in the second year (giving an initial rate of 5.19% and then 5.29%) from Birm ingham Midshires. The deal is available to those with a deposit of 5%-plus, but there is a \u00a3299 arrangement fee and early redemption penalties for the first two years. Provided enough people come forward, the discount in the second year will be upped to 2.5% and up to \u00a3400 cashback will be thrown in. \u0095 A loan fixed at 5.45% for two years for those able to stump up a deposit of at least 25%, or 5.65% for those who can only manage a 10% deposit. The lender is GMAC, the loans business owned by General Motors. There is a \u00a3295 arrangement fee and no redemption penalties. The bulk-buy enhancements would see the rates cut to 5.39%/5.59% and up to \u00a3385 of cashback provided. \u0095 A flexible deal only open to people remortgaging, fixed at 5.59% for two years, funded by the Woolwich. You need a deposit of 10%-plus, and there is no arrangement fee, but there are redemption penalties within the two years. The perks, provided enough people apply, include up to \u00a3650 cashback. Charcol says that as the service develops it plans to offer a range of bulk-buy deals. However, a situation could develop where those interested will wait for someone else to make the first move. A spokeswoman concedes there is a \"possibility\" that everyone will wait for everyone else to act. \"I'm sure some people will hang back to see what happens,\" she says. \"But all of these are market-leading products.\" Mortgages aren't the only area where you can group together to drive down costs. Independent financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown has a website allowing people to pool purchasing power to get the best deal on per sonal pensions. HL Pensions is launching a new offer enabling people to buy a stakeholder-compliant personal pension free of all charges until April and which after that has a maximum annual management charge of 0.8% - significantly less than many providers will be charging once the stakeholder pension regime comes into force. It can offer such attractive terms because it can go to the insurance company and buy on behalf of a large number of individuals. More than 150 people have registered for the offer since the last once closed at the beginning of December. Stakeholder pensions are a new type of personal pension which go on sale on April 6. With these, the maximum amount a company can charge you for managing your funds is 1% a year and they will be portable.

      "body": "<p>On Wednesday December 6, senior officials of the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority met in emergency session. The Tri-Partite Standing Committee is only called together to discuss events which could threaten the financial stability of Britain. The members knew by then, though the public did not, that Equitable Life, Britain's oldest mutual insurance company, was doomed in its present form.</p> <p>Senior managers at Prudential - the last company in the race to buy Equitable - had decided internally not to go ahead with the sale. It was frightened off by the unlimited liability of the company to 90,000 individual policyholders whose guarantees had been upheld in the House of Lords in July.</p> <p>With no buyer, Equitable could fail, and the officials met to manage the disaster ahead of the announcement of Equitable's closure 24 hours later.</p> <p>It was indeed a Wednesday full of woe for Thursday's child, Equitable. It had so far to go on Thursday 16 September 1762 when 11 men met in the City of London and approved the foundation deed of the Association of Equitable Assurances on Life and Survivorships. Using the work of James Dodson, a respected mathematician who had worked out the combination of life expectancy and statistics which form the foundations of the modern life assurance business - the science of the actuary - Equitable Life offered fixed premiums and - in a promise that was to echo down the generations - a guaranteed payout on death. <br><br>Over the next 238 years professional middle England poured in money, first for life insurance, then for savings and pensions. From 1957 Equitable extended the concept of guarantees - promising fixed levels of pension up to 50 years into the future.</p> <p>As a mutual society with no shareholders run for the benefit of members, Equitable seemed to have found the holy grail - low charges, high returns and low risk. Doctors, lawyers, teachers, civil servants, politicians, and journalists put their faith and money into Equitable. What they didn't know was that the actuaries who ran Equitable - no company had more per square foot - valued this pension promise at zero.</p> <p>Those same actuaries (motto: \"making financial sense of the future\") failed to spot two trends - falling interest rates and rising life expectancy. Together those changes cut in half the pensions that could be bought on the market. And suddenly the Equitable promise, which the actuaries had valued at zero, became an attractive option. <br><br>But as people retired and tried to claim it, the lawyers stepped forward with a scheme to cut back the pension fund paid to those with the guarantees. They still got their higher percentage, but of a smaller fund, driving down their net pensions to the same level that could be bought on the open market.</p> <p>So confident was the company that this wheeze was watertight that when its view was challenged it paid for a court case to prove it was right.

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday December 6, senior officials of the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority met in emergency session. The Tri-Partite Standing Committee is only called together to discuss events which could threaten the financial stability of Britain. The members knew by then, though the public did not, that Equitable Life, Britain's oldest mutual insurance company, was doomed in its present form. Senior managers at Prudential - the last company in the race to buy Equitable - had decided internally not to go ahead with the sale. It was frightened off by the unlimited liability of the company to 90,000 individual policyholders whose guarantees had been upheld in the House of Lords in July. With no buyer, Equitable could fail, and the officials met to manage the disaster ahead of the announcement of Equitable's closure 24 hours later. It was indeed a Wednesday full of woe for Thursday's child, Equitable. It had so far to go on Thursday 16 September 1762 when 11 men met in the City of London and approved the foundation deed of the Association of Equitable Assurances on Life and Survivorships. Using the work of James Dodson, a respected mathematician who had worked out the combination of life expectancy and statistics which form the foundations of the modern life assurance business - the science of the actuary - Equitable Life offered fixed premiums and - in a promise that was to echo down the generations - a guaranteed payout on death. Over the next 238 years professional middle England poured in money, first for life insurance, then for savings and pensions. From 1957 Equitable extended the concept of guarantees - promising fixed levels of pension up to 50 years into the future. As a mutual society with no shareholders run for the benefit of members, Equitable seemed to have found the holy grail - low charges, high returns and low risk. Doctors, lawyers, teachers, civil servants, politicians, and journalists put their faith and money into Equitable. What they didn't know was that the actuaries who ran Equitable - no company had more per square foot - valued this pension promise at zero. Those same actuaries (motto: \"making financial sense of the future\") failed to spot two trends - falling interest rates and rising life expectancy. Together those changes cut in half the pensions that could be bought on the market. And suddenly the Equitable promise, which the actuaries had valued at zero, became an attractive option. But as people retired and tried to claim it, the lawyers stepped forward with a scheme to cut back the pension fund paid to those with the guarantees. They still got their higher percentage, but of a smaller fund, driving down their net pensions to the same level that could be bought on the open market. So confident was the company that this wheeze was watertight that when its view was challenged it paid for a court case to prove it was right. But in July 2000, five Law Lords unanimously found the opposite, leaving Equitable with an unlimited liability to 90,000 individual members and - Money Box has discovered - 100,000 company pensioners. The insurance policy it had taken out in the 1980s against the potential \u00a31.5bn cost of the guarantees would not pay up. In a wonderful stroke of irony, the world's oldest mutual insurer had failed to cover itself against the House of Lords overturning its lawyers' interpretation of the law. There was nowhere to turn for the money but to the other 850,000 members who had no guarantee. Within an hour of the Law Lords' decision, the company told them it was taking all their investment growth from January to July to pay the bill. In a final gamble it put the company up for sale, hoping to recoup the cost and repay members. But 20 weeks later on Thursday 7 December, when Prudential formally pulled out, the Equitable Board considered the views of the Tri-Partite committee and made the decision that was announced to the world at 7.30 am next morning.

A professor of banking told us that \"risk management at Equitable Life was primitive in the extreme\" and \"the accounts gave no clue what was really going on\". The fall-out continues. Four separate inquiries have been launched; as well as the actuaries, accountants, and the Financial services Authority are all looking at what they did wrong and the Treasury Select Committee is investigating what everyone did wrong. This week people at the highest level in government, in regulation, in the law, are struggling to find a rescue deal which can only be days away. No one knows if it will work. But if the lawyers, politicians, and regulators cannot sort out the problems of the insurance company which they trusted with their money, what hope is there for the rest of us? \u0095 Paul Lewis presents Money Box on Radio 4, Saturdays at noon. A Money Box Special, An Inequitable Life, is on Radio 4, Sunday 21 January 5pm, repeated Thursday 25 January 8pm and after that on the internet at Money Box. 'Amnesty' gives pension scheme members a glimmer of hope Rupert Jones As talks continue about trying to find a solution to the Equitable Life crisis, there was a small slice of good news for people in company pension schemes provided by the insurer. It has been revealed that Equitable has introduced an \"amnesty\" allowing members of these schemes to carry on paying in for the moment while reserving the right to take out contributions paid in between December 8 2000 and March 31 2001 and transfer them to another pension provider. In other words, members can keep paying in while they mull over their options, and if they decide at the end of March to move to another provider, Equitable will let them withdraw the money paid in between these two dates. Scheme trustees must inform Equitable by this Friday if they want to take up the offer, which applies to 2,000 company schemes and 4,000 AVC top-up schemes provided by Equitable. It has granted the amnesty in order to give scheme trustees time to consult members if they wish to keep their money invested in Equitable's with-profits fund following the predictions of lower investment growth in future. Equitable is reportedly talking with several companies about the possible sale of parts or all of the business, and is also still discussing proposals put for ward by a policyholders' action group that would cap the insurer's liabilities.

But its shares have fallen from a peak of 263p to just 103.5p this year. </p> <p>Analysts complain that the business has a diffuse collection of interests.

Neither Mr Leech, who owns 48% of the business, nor chief executive Stuart Sim has a scientific background. Biotech investors worry that they spend too much time on other business ventures. </p> <p>Despite its good record in taking products through regulatory hurdles, ML is still losing money. Interim losses rose from \u00a36.9m to \u00a311.8m. This is partly due to poorly negotiated partnership deals - ML's breakthrough product was Extraneal, a kidney dialysis solution which has a longer lasting effect than its rivals.

      "bodyText": "Manchester millionaire Kevin Leech may have won the hearts of tourists by snapping up Land's End, John O' Groats and the Needles Pleasure Park, but his biotech company, ML Laboratories, is losing its popularity battle in the City. Unlike most biotech firms, ML has five products on the market - including a kidney dialysis fluid, several asthma inhalers and a gel to prevent post-operative adhesions. But its shares have fallen from a peak of 263p to just 103.5p this year. Analysts complain that the business has a diffuse collection of interests. Erling Refsum of Nomura says: \"You could almost call it an incubator - it tends to sort of pick up odd things with nothing much in common.\" There are also doubts about the management. Neither Mr Leech, who owns 48% of the business, nor chief executive Stuart Sim has a scientific background. Biotech investors worry that they spend too much time on other business ventures. Despite its good record in taking products through regulatory hurdles, ML is still losing money. Interim losses rose from \u00a36.9m to \u00a311.8m. This is partly due to poorly negotiated partnership deals - ML's breakthrough product was Extraneal, a kidney dialysis solution which has a longer lasting effect than its rivals. It has a 25% market share in Europe, but ML gets just 10% of the revenue under a marketing deal with Baxter Healthcare. ML's peak annual income from the product is unlikely to exceed \u00a37m. ML is burning \u00a39m of cash a year and has just \u00a314m left. It arranged a convertible loan from NM Rothschild this week for a further \u00a37.5m, but that means the bank could have a claim on shares in the future. Rothschild is \"considering options\" for ML in a strategic review. A sale of some subsidiaries, a complete break-up or a management buyout are all possibilities. ML is capitalised at a modest \u00a3162m. But the shares should be given a wide berth.",

A self-declared investment amateur, Mr Barron's spread of fund selections strongly outperformed the -2% that the \u00a31 trillion UK investment industry managed on average last year.</p> <p>But the biggest winner will be children's charity Barnardo's, which stands to pick up around \u00a3100,000 from the Challenge, generously donated by the unit trust and investment trust companies listed opposite. The money will go to support its vital work in projects around Britain.</p> <p>Last year we asked Jobs &amp; Money readers to select from the list opposite the five funds they thought would be the fastest growing during 2000. At the end of the year the winner would be the one whose portfolio of funds achieved the highest investment performance.</p> <p>Many readers plumped for technology funds, which were racing ahead at the beginning of last year. But after early gains of 20-30%, the dot.com blowout saw the funds fall back to end the year 20-25% down.</p> <p>Others pinned their hopes on a recovery in the Far East after the 1997/98 economic crisis, or believed that Japan was about to pull out of its long slump. But their hopes were cruelly dashed, and optimistically named portfolios such as Asiaboom, EastIsBest and Eastern Promise saw quite the reverse. Over the year the typical portfolio of Far East funds fell by 30-40%.</p> <p>Mr Barron pipped the others in a close-run race by choosing a selection of income funds plus a European and an American fund.

      "bodyText": "A retired geography teacher from Cumbria has topped the 5,000 entrants in the Guardian/Barnardo's Investment Challenge - and beaten the returns achieved by the vast majority of City financial experts - to scoop the \u00a310,000 first prize. Michael Barron, 56, from the village of Dalston, near Carlisle, saw his selection of funds rise in value by nearly 10% during 2000, a remarkable achievement during one of the worst years for stock market investment in decades. A self-declared investment amateur, Mr Barron's spread of fund selections strongly outperformed the -2% that the \u00a31 trillion UK investment industry managed on average last year. But the biggest winner will be children's charity Barnardo's, which stands to pick up around \u00a3100,000 from the Challenge, generously donated by the unit trust and investment trust companies listed opposite. The money will go to support its vital work in projects around Britain. Last year we asked Jobs &amp; Money readers to select from the list opposite the five funds they thought would be the fastest growing during 2000. At the end of the year the winner would be the one whose portfolio of funds achieved the highest investment performance. Many readers plumped for technology funds, which were racing ahead at the beginning of last year. But after early gains of 20-30%, the dot.com blowout saw the funds fall back to end the year 20-25% down. Others pinned their hopes on a recovery in the Far East after the 1997/98 economic crisis, or believed that Japan was about to pull out of its long slump. But their hopes were cruelly dashed, and optimistically named portfolios such as Asiaboom, EastIsBest and Eastern Promise saw quite the reverse. Over the year the typical portfolio of Far East funds fell by 30-40%. Mr Barron pipped the others in a close-run race by choosing a selection of income funds plus a European and an American fund. His selections were Credit Suisse Transatlantic (up 16.83%), Jupiter Income (up 10.35%), Axa Sun Life Higher Income (up 9.29%), TU European (up 7.63%) and Schroder High Yield Bond fund (up 4.28%). Was it luck or judgment that led to Mr Barron picking a winning combination? \"I'm not really a buyer of shares or funds. All I've ever done is invest a lump sum from a maturing endowment policy,\" he says. But Mr Barron decided to put some effort into selecting his investments for the Challenge, which goes to show that a little bit of research, plus a dollop of luck, can steer even investment amateurs to success. \"I did closely go through all 52 of the funds The Guardian listed and chose according to their performance over the past one and three years.\" He says three decisions stood him in good stead. \"Firstly, I decided to steer clear of the Far East as I did not think there was going to be a recovery in the short term. Secondly, I didn't like the look of hi-tech; I thought it was a bubble about to burst. My third decision was that America still looked promising, which is why I picked Transatlantic. The name seemed to sum up exactly what I wanted.\" He also compiled a portfolio that was cautiously geared towards income funds, which invest in a selection of high yielding shares and bonds, which performed well last year as big investors moved out of racy \"growth\" stocks into safer \"value\" stocks and bonds. But it was only a late gallop by Mr Barron's portfolio that pushed him over the winning line ahead of the pack. At the end of October, Mr Barron was ninth on the leader board, and by end November had edged up to sixth before leaping into first place at the end of December. Sadly for Shivani Parikh, who had held first place in both October and November, her portfolio slipped back to end fifth of the nearly 5,000 entries into the Challenge. The competition was so closely fought that Jobs &amp; Money called in fund measurement experts Standard &amp; Poor's to verify the figures. Standard &amp; Poor's has the investment industry's most comprehensive database of funds, compiling figures on 51,000 funds in 52 countries.

At least this was ahead of the investment advisers we contacted a year ago; not one managed to put together a positive portfolio. The key to staying one step ahead Don't put all your eggs in one basket, don't expect an instant fortune and don't follow fashion; these are the lessons for small investors from the Guardian Investment Challenge. Advisers recommend first-time punters should opt for international general trusts which balance and diversify risk. Witan, an international general trust which entered the Challenge, managed a creditable 1% gain over the year when the average trust fell by a tenth. Our winner managed to avoid the worst of the market setbacks last year by spreading his investments across three UK-based income funds, an American fund and a European fund, and checking past performance figures.

Investing in technology over the long term is probably a wise decision, but jumping into a specialist area as your first investment is not. The top-performing fund in the Challenge, and one picked by Mr Barron, was Credit Suisse Transatlantic. It sidestepped the dot.com fallout this year because it will only invest in companies with good cash flow.

Few people, if they thought about it, would wish to live forever, at least in this world; Shaw's Methuselah suggests that endless existence would be intolerable. But death comes too soon for most of us, before our interest in the world, and in those we love, is exhausted. </p> <p> From the subjective perspective, being dead is indistinguishable from being unborn, or from dreamless sleep, and can therefore hold no terrors. What seems frightening is the prospect of dying. But dying is an act of living; it is something only the living do, and like most other such acts - eating, walking, feeling happy or ill - it might be pleasant or otherwise. </p> <p>But being dead is not something we experience. We experience death only in losing others, and the experience is one of grief. Accordingly, our own deaths are no part of our personal history: each of us experiences only life. In this sense, from the subjective perspective we are immortal. Marcus Aurelius, emperor and Stoic philosopher, said that when we die we lose only the present moment, for the past has gone and the future has not begun; so to comfort ourselves we need only ask, \"is this present moment really worth keeping?\" </p> <p> But Aurelius is wrong.

One appeared on the cover of G2, the tabloid second section of the paper, and the other was carried across pages 2 and 3 of the same issue. Broadly, the complaints were that the pictures were exploitative and intrusive. Three of them came from health service professionals, one a former pathology technician, one a nurse who was on duty at her hospital in Scotland when I spoke to her, and the third a dermatologist. </p> <p>The cover picture was the one which, in the words of the features editor who took the decision to run it, \"everyone was talking about\". It showed dead bodies lying on the unrefrigerated floor of a chapel in Bedford Hospital. It was used first across the front page of the free newspaper, Bedfordshire on Sunday, whose photographer had taken it, and by the Sunday Telegraph. On Monday it was used in the Mirror and the Daily Mail.

      "bodyText": "Several readers complained about two pictures of dead people published in the Guardian last Tuesday. One appeared on the cover of G2, the tabloid second section of the paper, and the other was carried across pages 2 and 3 of the same issue. Broadly, the complaints were that the pictures were exploitative and intrusive. Three of them came from health service professionals, one a former pathology technician, one a nurse who was on duty at her hospital in Scotland when I spoke to her, and the third a dermatologist. The cover picture was the one which, in the words of the features editor who took the decision to run it, \"everyone was talking about\". It showed dead bodies lying on the unrefrigerated floor of a chapel in Bedford Hospital. It was used first across the front page of the free newspaper, Bedfordshire on Sunday, whose photographer had taken it, and by the Sunday Telegraph. On Monday it was used in the Mirror and the Daily Mail. The Guardian paid \u00a3500 (more than it normally pays for the front of G2) to use it on Tuesday having been asked initially for \u00a31,500, I was told. It was used in a medium-sized format, across the equivalent of about three broadsheet columns, floating in the middle of a black front tabloid page carrying these words: \"This photograph has horrified Britain. But what does it tell us more about?

      "body": "<p>Is realism dead? Or is it the bedrock of modern drama? The old question was revived this week by the extraordinary appearance, on successive nights, of two new plays by the 32-year-old Torben Betts. A Listening Heaven, at the Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, turned out to be an Ayckbournian family tragi-comedy; Incarcerator at BAC, London, was a Berkoffian verse-drama about a brutalist Britain. The former, though thematically overloaded, was totally gripping; the latter felt like a bloated wordfest. </p> <p>If A Listening Heaven has parallels with Ayckbourn, it is hardly surprising. Betts sent his play to Ayckbourn's Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough, where it was premiered in July 1999. He also spent six months there as writer-in-residence, and you can see exactly why he and Ayckbourn would hit it off. His play belongs to a familiar domestic tradition in which a struggling young artist, Gillian, returns home for her brother's funeral and observes all the lies, hypocrisies and miseries that have driven her away in the first place. Like countless writers before him, Betts shows that home is where the hurt is. </p> <p>Realism is clearly Betts's forte. Like Ayckbourn in Absurd Person Singular, he sets the action in a kitchen - not only a place where work gets done but where people flee from the horrors of a post-funeral party. Betts's characters also have the right edge of desperation. Gillian's mother cleans with neurotically obsessive fervour while her father hovers ineffectually. Her aunt Rosie drinks herself stupid under the infuriated gaze of her dickhead husband, who drones on about viticulture and golf. </p> <p>We are in familiar suburban territory. But it is precisely because Betts's play is anchored in real life that he is able to expand it theatrically. He starts with what he knows and then works outwards to take on board science and religion, art and materialism, hapless consumerism and ecological awareness. Admittedly, this last is a bit shadowy - the dead son, Stephen, was an idealistic eco-warrior who abandoned his family to work in India but it was never clear to me how or why that contributed to his demise. </p> <p>But even if Betts throws in everything including the kitchen sink, one scene of quite shattering impact proves he is a real dramatist. We are invited, for much of the evening, to share Gillian's derisive view of her family. Finally, the departing daughter confronts her tight-lipped mother and all the latter's pent-up grief and despair bursts out in a tide of destructive obscenity. As played by Alexandra Mathie, who all evening has seemed a model of fussy rectitude, and Molly Innes as the heartless daughter, the scene has an O'Neill-like emotional force. And Muriel Romanes's production, which boasts fine performances from Morag Hood as the alcoholic aunt and Jimmy Chisholm as her philistine husband, grasps Betts's key point - that however much we may scorn the conservative values of middle England or Scotland, individuals are still capable of tragic suffering. </p> <p>I came out of the Lyceum exhilarated by Betts's heightened realism. But I emerged from Incarcerator at BAC, after close on three hours of cartoon savagery, feeling punch-drunk. At bottom, the play tells a simple tale of two East End boozing partners. Jessop marries young, repents at leisure, runs up debts. Morris prizes his solitude but shacks up with Jessop's oldest chum. She wants a baby. Morris can't give her one. So she offers Jessop \u00a35,000 if he will inseminate her. This produces a bloodbath straight out of Jacobean tragedy. In fact, the scene where Jessop is able to make love to the baby-seeking Fisher only when she dons a Margaret Thatcher mask is one of the funniest in the piece: as she later reminds him, in Betts's characteristic doggerel, \"You didn't mind a spot of matin' when you thought that I was Satan.\" But Betts dresses up this fable about East End folk with all kinds of twaddle in which a Dostoevskian holy innocent wanders through London and in which a choric figure constantly appears, symbolising imprisoning society. </p> <p>The points Betts makes are not that different from those in A Listening Heaven - that we are all torn between the claims of commitment and freedom and oppressed by modern materialism. But Incarcerator, for all the vigour of Peter Craze's production and the industrious ubiquity of Peter Kenvyn as the chorus, is just bombastic nonsense with scant regard for character. </p> <p>What alarms me is that Betts, who has yet another new play, called Clockwatching, coming up shortly in Richmond and Scarborough, says he is abandoning \"social realism\" and is now under the influence of Howard Barker. I know it sounds much sexier to say one is a theatrical poet rather than a domestic realist, but the observation of quotidian truth is the hardest of all theatrical tasks. On the evidence so far, I'd say it is the one for which Betts was born. </p> <p>\u0095 A Listening Heaven is at Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh (0131-248 4848), until February 3; Incarcerator is at BAC, London SW11 (020-7223 2223), until February 4.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It may be mid-January but the first signs of spring are already showing. In Gallery Bottom wood we found the leaf buds of sycamore and hornbeam swelling and the outer scales breaking out. At the woodland edge, by an area of scrubland, we even found oak leaf buds ripening. Down on the woodland floor, the first spear-shaped leaf shoots of bluebells pushed through the leaf litter. </p> <p>It may be all a bit premature though. Freezing temperatures over the past few days have frozen the ground solid. Bramble and ivy leaves remained rimed around their outer edges with hoarfrost throughout the day. Squirrels and rabbits had chewed at the first green bluebell shoots, and dug out the buried bulbs. </p> <p>Only where the sun was able to reach the steep-sided valley floor during the warmest period, the middle of the day, had the frost melted, but even here, the leaf litter and surface crust was still crisp and brittle. </p> <p>Sedges, overhanging the stream, were clothed in ice 20 times thicker, the sedges looking like wicks through the frozen water candles.

      "bodyText": "It may be mid-January but the first signs of spring are already showing. In Gallery Bottom wood we found the leaf buds of sycamore and hornbeam swelling and the outer scales breaking out. At the woodland edge, by an area of scrubland, we even found oak leaf buds ripening. Down on the woodland floor, the first spear-shaped leaf shoots of bluebells pushed through the leaf litter. It may be all a bit premature though. Freezing temperatures over the past few days have frozen the ground solid. Bramble and ivy leaves remained rimed around their outer edges with hoarfrost throughout the day. Squirrels and rabbits had chewed at the first green bluebell shoots, and dug out the buried bulbs. Only where the sun was able to reach the steep-sided valley floor during the warmest period, the middle of the day, had the frost melted, but even here, the leaf litter and surface crust was still crisp and brittle. Sedges, overhanging the stream, were clothed in ice 20 times thicker, the sedges looking like wicks through the frozen water candles. Referred to in Sheffield manorial records as the Kimberworth Boundary Stream, it forms part of the Anglo-Saxon boundary between the ancient parishes of Kimberworth and Ecclesfield. Most of the pond at the bottom of the valley was frozen solid except for a long, open lead, extending half way across the pond, where the stream flows in.

Why shouldn't it work for me? </p> <p>You can't fault his logic but, alas, it hasn't worked. Some of his facial expressions still bring to mind his previous role, but more problematic is the worrying feeling that O'Hanlon simply doesn't have the breadth of acting ability required to vanquish Dougal. </p> <p>Not that Big Bad World is a gripping, well-written drama that demands heartfelt performances. It's more of a half-hearted, somnambulist stroll through the territory of thirtysomething angst. When Kath asks, \"Eamon, what are you doing here?\" it's a pertinent question. But it is one that she should really direct to whichever unimaginative executive re-commissioned this pile of unamusing, unrealistic, sluggish nonsense. </p> <p>Worse are the hopeless characterisations, written in sitcom shorthand. Stuart, Kath's new love interest, is an osteopath who writes her haiku after they have sex and does t'ai chi naked. He even makes Thai green curry (though, amazingly, without lemongrass). You may have already worked out that Stuart - New Age-y and in touch with his chi - is a lazily written stereotype. </p> <p>The plot isn't much better. Returning to the magazine he abandoned (lucky magazine), Eamon is seconded to Carp! Magazine to revive its fortunes. In yet another wide-of-the-mark, weary foray, a slimy Tony Robinson is the lame magazine's predictably geeky editor, whose personality - complete with hilarious fishy fascination! - could well have been discovered by Robinson himself in Time Team under the bones of a Viking virgin sacrifice. </p> <p>Directionless and unsure of foot, Big Bad World is actually quite cynical. It tries to be smart, contemporary and moving by filling in check boxes (Love triangle? Check. Pretty but not threateningly so heroine? Check), but only succeeds in exposing its formulaic, dull nature. The only amusement to be derived from this waste of space is remarking on Beth Goddard's hair, which makes her look like a puffer fish, and wondering why Dusty Springfield bursts into song wherever Eamon goes. Does he have a Walkman in his pocket? </p> <p> Timewatch (BBC2) provided a fascinating glimpse into the very heart of Nazi Germany in Himmler, Hitler and The End of the Reich. Revealing \"for the first time on television\" the fracturing of the relationship between the two most powerful Nazis, its span was impressive. It told of the recruitment of Bosnian Muslim SS officers, plans to swap Jews for trucks and foreign currency, and the increasing divergence of opinion between Himmler and his f\u00fchrer as the war wore on. </p> <p>In living rooms with three-piece suites, horrible lampshades and bowls of fruit, those once complicit in genocide polished ingots of information that, melted down together, produced a comprehensive, compelling picture of the way Himmler and Hitler interacted and the ideological compromises they made when it suited them. </p> <p>One man told of the mood in Hitler's Berlin bunker, where the main preoccupation was How Do I Kill Myself - cyanide tablet or bullet in the brain? (Having watched Big Bad World, I knew how they felt.) He spoke of the further claustrophobia when Hitler heard a BBC broadcast revealing Himmler's attempts to seek peace with the west. It was emotional, dramatic stuff. </p> <p>You can imagine wanting to be someone else, someone famous - a pop star, say. But a pop star like Benny from Abba? He's hardly Mr Rock'n'roll, is he? He hangs around with Tim Rice. Whatever, there was a Benny, a Bjorn and a host of other ersatz popstars on Battle of the Fantasy Bands (BBC1). </p> <p>It certainly lived up to its title but only if you have really sick fantasies (the Vanessa Feltz-covered-in-peanut-butter kind). Most of these Stars in Their Eyes rejects evidently did have a touch of weirdness about them but it was the audience who suffered most.

Even that bombastic venue wouldn't entirely suit; but when their voluptuous, majestic ballads make you think of red velvet, real pianos and chandeliers simultaneously with brick-walled basement bars fogged with cigarette smoke, it's hard to imagine a setting that would suit. </p> <p>Strangely, the moment they start another image springs to mind: Frank Sinatra in the film Young at Heart, heart-breaking, singing One More for the Road while his indifferent restaurant audience chatters over their cocktails. </p> <p>Cousteau, like Sinatra in that scene, are the grand drama in the background that brings colour to our own mundanity. They look as if they've been through all the love and loss, alleyway brawls and seedy hotel romances fate could throw at them. </p> <p>It could, as songwriter Davey Ray Moor suggests in She Don't Hear Your Prayer, just be a trick of the light, of the sharp suits, impeccably decorated shirts and a drummer who looks like Tom Waits.

      "bodyText": "Roll on the days when Cousteau are famous enough to perform in the Royal Albert Hall, because these dirty black rooms are all wrong for them. Even that bombastic venue wouldn't entirely suit; but when their voluptuous, majestic ballads make you think of red velvet, real pianos and chandeliers simultaneously with brick-walled basement bars fogged with cigarette smoke, it's hard to imagine a setting that would suit. Strangely, the moment they start another image springs to mind: Frank Sinatra in the film Young at Heart, heart-breaking, singing One More for the Road while his indifferent restaurant audience chatters over their cocktails. Cousteau, like Sinatra in that scene, are the grand drama in the background that brings colour to our own mundanity. They look as if they've been through all the love and loss, alleyway brawls and seedy hotel romances fate could throw at them. It could, as songwriter Davey Ray Moor suggests in She Don't Hear Your Prayer, just be a trick of the light, of the sharp suits, impeccably decorated shirts and a drummer who looks like Tom Waits. More likely it testifies to Cousteau's rare ability to be decidedly more than just five musicians influenced by Waits, Scott Walker, Nick Drake and Nick Cave; to make you think that every one of their songs offers life in a nutshell.

Like Scholl at his best, Karamazov communicated unconcealed enjoyment of the music, crouched around his lute and peering over the top with the unselfconscious absorption of a Raphael cherub.

As in his production of the Henry VI trilogy, Boyd also reminds us that death is an entrance as well as an exit: he not only has Mercutio and Tybalt gaze down on the final scene but allows Romeo and Juliet to rise from the tomb and view the attempt to memorialise them with justified cynicism. As in Brecht, the revelation of what will happen allows us to focus on how it will happen; and nowhere does this pay richer dividends than in Gilbreath's Juliet. </p> <p>The ecstasy of love is there all right: in the balcony scene she lies prone on Piper's parapet and twirls her naked feet with giddy abandon. But, even at the height of passion, she is filled with foreboding, fearing the love-contract is \"too rash, too unadvised, too sudden\". Her prolonged pause before she digests the news that Romeo is \"banished\" heralds a fixation with death. She places the Nurse's halter round her neck, and at one point sniffs, with morbid fascination, the poison Lady Capulet has apparently prepared for Romeo. </p> <p>Gilbreath's supreme achievement, however, is to convey the intensity of life that stems from an awareness of mortality.

It is there, too, in Tennant's Romeo that moves, with total conviction, from rapt self-obsession to awareness of the other, and finally inconsolable hysteria. </p> <p>I was even more impressed by Des McAleer's Friar Lawrence, whose herbal bed turns out to be a subterranean grave and who is keenly aware that all life is a contest between divinity and desire - or, as McAleer cries out with fierce articulation, \"grace and rude will\". Stephen Warbeck's music adds to the sense of omen that attends this superb production: a plangent cello accompanies the deathly fights and an interpolated Brechtian ballad prefigures the lovers' destiny. But the preoccupation with death lends Boyd's revisionist production, infinitely superior to the recent ill-spoken affair at the National, a paradoxically vivid life. I also had the pleasure of seeing it at a matinee full of schoolchildren, who listened with rapt attentiveness and who burst into spontaneous cheers, shouts and whistles at the end.
