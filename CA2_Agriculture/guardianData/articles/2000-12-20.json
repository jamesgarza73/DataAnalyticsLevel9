      "byline": "Staff and agencies",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A bill which could ban hunting with hounds cleared its first major hurdle tonight, when MPs voted overwhelmingly to allow it to continue to progress through parliament. The House of Commons agreed to give the hunting bill a second reading by 373 votes to 158, a majority of 215. </p> <p> Earlier, a crowd of about 1,500 countryside protesters staged a vocal demonstration outside parliament. Police vans blocked off the entrance to the Commons as the demonstrators massed, and mounted police joined colleagues on foot in keeping order. </p> <p>MPs were voting only on whether to allow the Bill to proceed through its next parliamentary stages. It contains three options - an almost total ban on hunting with dogs, compulsory licensing of hunts, or self-regulation. MPs will get a free vote on the options, though that choice will not be put before them until the bill's committee stage early next year. </p> <p>There has, however, been a solid majority in favour of a ban since Labour's 1997 general election victory. It is expected that any move to ban hunting will spark fierce opposition in the Lords, making the legislation a possible casualty if a general election is called in the spring. </p> <p>Leading off tonight's debate, home secretary Jack Straw told MPs that the passions aroused by the hunting issue had been reflected in the 100,000-plus letters on the subject sent to the home office since the 1997 general election. </p> <p>Mr Straw himself came out in favour not of an outright ban, but of regulation of hunting through a licensing system. Mr Straw, who has never voted one way or the other in previous bids to ban hunting during 21 years as an MP, came off the fence to tell the Commons that he would support a scheme of regulation, as put forward by the Middle Way Group of MPs. </p> <p>Under the scheme, hunting would become a licensed activity, with anyone wishing to take part having to apply to a Hunting Authority for a licence.

      "bodyText": "A bill which could ban hunting with hounds cleared its first major hurdle tonight, when MPs voted overwhelmingly to allow it to continue to progress through parliament. The House of Commons agreed to give the hunting bill a second reading by 373 votes to 158, a majority of 215. Earlier, a crowd of about 1,500 countryside protesters staged a vocal demonstration outside parliament. Police vans blocked off the entrance to the Commons as the demonstrators massed, and mounted police joined colleagues on foot in keeping order. MPs were voting only on whether to allow the Bill to proceed through its next parliamentary stages. It contains three options - an almost total ban on hunting with dogs, compulsory licensing of hunts, or self-regulation. MPs will get a free vote on the options, though that choice will not be put before them until the bill's committee stage early next year. There has, however, been a solid majority in favour of a ban since Labour's 1997 general election victory. It is expected that any move to ban hunting will spark fierce opposition in the Lords, making the legislation a possible casualty if a general election is called in the spring. Leading off tonight's debate, home secretary Jack Straw told MPs that the passions aroused by the hunting issue had been reflected in the 100,000-plus letters on the subject sent to the home office since the 1997 general election. Mr Straw himself came out in favour not of an outright ban, but of regulation of hunting through a licensing system. Mr Straw, who has never voted one way or the other in previous bids to ban hunting during 21 years as an MP, came off the fence to tell the Commons that he would support a scheme of regulation, as put forward by the Middle Way Group of MPs. Under the scheme, hunting would become a licensed activity, with anyone wishing to take part having to apply to a Hunting Authority for a licence. Tory spokesman David Lidington told the Commons that Conservative MPs would have a free vote on the issue, but he said that in his opinion the bill was \"misguided and unnecessary\". \"The evidence that hunting is unacceptably cruel would need to be overwhelming, based on substantial and compelling evidence, in order to justify a ban. The case for a ban on animal welfare grounds is in my view shaky,\" said Mr Lidington. Former Tory prime minister John Major accused Labour of staging the hunting bill to win votes by turning the nation against a minority of \"red faced toffs\". Mr Major claimed the bill was \"a breathtaking example of political self-interest overriding the natural justice of a minority\". However Michael Foster, the Labour MP for Worcester, whose private member's bill to ban hunting was supported by 411 MPs in November 1997, told colleagues that the \"beginning of the end\" of fox hunting had arrived. Earlier, outside parliament, the protesters - describing themselves as \"rural freedom fighters\" - blew hunting horns, jeered and whistled as their numbers spilled on to the road and blocked traffic. The demonstrators, who earlier staged a mass rally in Trafalgar Square, planted several banners into the green at Parliament Square, each carrying a message demanding that the government drop the bill. One banner read \"Blair, Blair doesn't care, rural England says hunting is fair\", and another alleged \"Blair destroys England\". Simon Hart, director of the Campaign for Hunting, said: \"We are delighted with the turnout. Over 70, 50-seater coaches came from all over Britain. \"The fact that the Home Secretary has concluded that there is no case for a ban should be the clearest signal to his parliamentary colleagues, that they should think very seriously about which way they should vote.\"",

      "body": "<p>David Jones is prepared to relaunch his career by succeeding Colin Lee as manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers. </p> <p>Lee, who guided Wolves to within one place of the First Division play-offs in the past two seasons, became the fourth manager in six years to be sacked by the club after Sunday's home defeat by Birmingham City. </p> <p>He follows Graham Turner, Graham Taylor and Mark McGhee through the Molineux exit door but Jones, the former Southampton manager who was acquitted of child abuse charges, would have little hesitation in trying his luck. </p> <p>\"I want to get back into management sooner rather than later but I'm sorry it's situations like the sackings of Colin Lee that can help me,\" said Jones. </p> <p>\"I'm very flattered to be linked with the job and it's gratifying to know I haven't been forgotten. I'd be very interested in it but I don't know if I'll be applying - I imagine that for a job like this you'd be approached.\" </p> <p>Despite his enforced sabbatical, Jones has maintained his connections with the game by helping out Gary Johnson, a friend who has been coaching the Latvian national team. The managers of two of Wolves' neighbours, Ray Graydon of Walsall and Jan Molby of Kidderminster Harriers, have also been linked with the position, as has the promotion specialist Dave Bassett who parted company with Barnsley yesterday. </p> <p>Stuart Baxter, the former coach of AIK Stockholm whose father played alongside Billy Wright, and the club s record goalscorer Steve Bull have also expressed an interest. \"Although I've officially retired from playing I know most of the players inside out and if I can't motivate them then who can?\" said the 35-year-old Bull, currently coach at the Conference club Hereford United. </p> <p>With the team just one point above the relegation zone, Lee's position was already tenuous before he practically talked himself out of a job after publicly disagreeing with the chief executive Jez Moxey on a radio phone-in. </p> <p>Moxey, who has been at Molineux for just six months, said on local radio on Friday that the transfer of Wolves' leading scorer Ade Akinbiyi to Leicester City for \u00a35m during the summer had been made with Lee's full agreement. </p> <p>Lee, who was listening to the show, not only disagreed but phoned the station to broadcast his version of events. Not only was he adamant he did not agree with the sale of Akinbiyi, but he also criticised the board for not sanctioning his two planned big summer signings - David Burrows and Paul Williams from Coventry City. </p> <p>After a meeting with Lee before Sunday's game, Moxey played a tape of the radio show to the board. The meeting, which involved the Wolves benefactor and chairman Sir Jack Hayward via a conference call from his Bahamas base, voted unanimously to sack Lee, a decision Moxey denied had anything to do with the phone-in. </p> <p>\"If we'd won the derby game 5-0 this wouldn t have happened, I don t want you to place too much emphasis on the phone-in,\" Moxey said. \"But our current league position - averaging just one point a game - is dangerously close to relegation form. </p> <p>\"We appreciate that Colin has faced problems with injuries, but the entire board felt decisive action needed to be taken. Supporters are voting with their feet, and we must not allow indifference to take hold. Colin has made every effort to bring success to Wolves but sadly, results have not matched his commitment.\" </p> <p>Lee's sacking is at odds with the feelings of the supporters. They played a major role in seeing off Turner, Taylor and McGhee but little dissatisfaction has been aimed at Lee, who has not been granted anything like the transfer budget of his predecessors.

      "bodyText": "David Jones is prepared to relaunch his career by succeeding Colin Lee as manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers. Lee, who guided Wolves to within one place of the First Division play-offs in the past two seasons, became the fourth manager in six years to be sacked by the club after Sunday's home defeat by Birmingham City. He follows Graham Turner, Graham Taylor and Mark McGhee through the Molineux exit door but Jones, the former Southampton manager who was acquitted of child abuse charges, would have little hesitation in trying his luck. \"I want to get back into management sooner rather than later but I'm sorry it's situations like the sackings of Colin Lee that can help me,\" said Jones. \"I'm very flattered to be linked with the job and it's gratifying to know I haven't been forgotten. I'd be very interested in it but I don't know if I'll be applying - I imagine that for a job like this you'd be approached.\" Despite his enforced sabbatical, Jones has maintained his connections with the game by helping out Gary Johnson, a friend who has been coaching the Latvian national team. The managers of two of Wolves' neighbours, Ray Graydon of Walsall and Jan Molby of Kidderminster Harriers, have also been linked with the position, as has the promotion specialist Dave Bassett who parted company with Barnsley yesterday. Stuart Baxter, the former coach of AIK Stockholm whose father played alongside Billy Wright, and the club s record goalscorer Steve Bull have also expressed an interest. \"Although I've officially retired from playing I know most of the players inside out and if I can't motivate them then who can?\" said the 35-year-old Bull, currently coach at the Conference club Hereford United. With the team just one point above the relegation zone, Lee's position was already tenuous before he practically talked himself out of a job after publicly disagreeing with the chief executive Jez Moxey on a radio phone-in. Moxey, who has been at Molineux for just six months, said on local radio on Friday that the transfer of Wolves' leading scorer Ade Akinbiyi to Leicester City for \u00a35m during the summer had been made with Lee's full agreement. Lee, who was listening to the show, not only disagreed but phoned the station to broadcast his version of events. Not only was he adamant he did not agree with the sale of Akinbiyi, but he also criticised the board for not sanctioning his two planned big summer signings - David Burrows and Paul Williams from Coventry City. After a meeting with Lee before Sunday's game, Moxey played a tape of the radio show to the board. The meeting, which involved the Wolves benefactor and chairman Sir Jack Hayward via a conference call from his Bahamas base, voted unanimously to sack Lee, a decision Moxey denied had anything to do with the phone-in. \"If we'd won the derby game 5-0 this wouldn t have happened, I don t want you to place too much emphasis on the phone-in,\" Moxey said. \"But our current league position - averaging just one point a game - is dangerously close to relegation form. \"We appreciate that Colin has faced problems with injuries, but the entire board felt decisive action needed to be taken. Supporters are voting with their feet, and we must not allow indifference to take hold. Colin has made every effort to bring success to Wolves but sadly, results have not matched his commitment.\" Lee's sacking is at odds with the feelings of the supporters. They played a major role in seeing off Turner, Taylor and McGhee but little dissatisfaction has been aimed at Lee, who has not been granted anything like the transfer budget of his predecessors. Instead, Lee had to sell the likes of Robbie Keane and then Akinbiyi before making signings. More financial constraints have followed since Moxey's arrival which, with the club losing \u00a340,000 a week and Hayward refusing to continue bankrolling the losses after investing more than \u00a340m, were understandable. More than 1,000 supporters made their feelings clear following last month's home defeat by Crystal Palace when they demonstrated outside Molineux. Their anger was directed not at Hayward, who tried to calm the crowd, but Moxey. Despite his efforts, Hayward was sworn and spat at. Since then he has not returned to the club from his Bahamas base, although before leaving he assured Lee his job was safe. \"We ve chopped and changed managers too freqeuntly in the past and I can't see the point of doing so again now,\" he said. \"Our biggest mistake was not giving Graham Taylor enough time.\" John Ward, Lee's assistant who will take charge of the team until a successor is appointed, was not surprised. \"This is something that has been lurking in the background for a while,\" he said. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "trailText": "<p><strong>Profile: </strong>  Fiona Reynolds, new head of the National Trust</p>",
      "byline": "Nicola Hill",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The woman set to take the helm of the National Trust claims not to have a personal view on hunting. Yet the hunting bill was one of the priorities in the Queen's speech and the trust still allows hunting on its land. Fiona Reynolds, the 42-year-old director-general designate, insists that \"my challenge is to look at a whole range of other things\". </p> <p>These things include managing one of Britain's largest charities with more than 2.5m members, 612,000 acres of land and 600 miles of coastline. On top of this, there is the upkeep of 250 historic houses, gardens and industrial buildings and 60m visitors a year to entertain. Annual expenditure on conservation and maintenance is \u00a3148m. </p> <p>Sitting in an armchair at the trust's headquarters overlooking St James Park in London, Ms Reynolds appears feisty, full of energy and ready to shake off the dusty image of the 105-year-old charity. \"The trust has to some extent a caricature image, not necessarily a negative one, but an image of grand country houses,\" she says. \"Whereas the breadth of what we do in relation to the countryside, and the huge responsibility as a land manager, mean we should be seen as a much more influential body. </p> <p>\"I'm hoping to draw together some clear ambitions for the trust, including the leadership role we can play in relation to the countryside and regeneration of land.\" </p> <p>One of Ms Reynolds's key concerns is what she sees as a general resignation that the countryside is in crisis. \"I think the trust has a really powerful role to play in helping to find solutions. Our experience of investing in solutions which are economically viable, as well as environmentally and socially sustainable, gives us the opportunity to show other landowners and people in the countryside what is possible.\" </p> <p>Ms Reynolds, a married mother of three, talks as if she has been part of the National Trust furniture for a long time. In fact she has, joining a regional committee in her early 20s - \"probably one of the youngest ever\", she lets slip. Along with a local group called the Save Sutton House campaign, she fought successfully for the trust to restore the rare Tudor house it owned in Hackney, east London. At the time, it was boarded up and inhabited by squatters and the trust was at a loss to know what to do. Ms Reynolds and her team fulfilled a vision of making it accessible for community use and education. \"We wanted to make it a place where children could come in and really explore.\" </p> <p>She is also proud of her campaigning role at the Council for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE), where she was director from 1992-98 and tackled issues such as housing development, energy supply and transport. At the end of her tenure, she was awarded a CBE for services to agro-environment and conservation. </p> <p>As well as her experience of campaigning on countryside issues, Ms Reynolds has just spent two years on the inside track of government as director of the women's unit at the Cabinet Office. \"That experience was enormously important, understanding how policy is made and implemented and working on issues that cut across different departments,\" she says. </p> <p>Although she was happy there, a friend spotted the National Trust's advertisement for a new director-general - a bait she found \"pretty irresistible\". The incumbent, Martin Drury, who has been with the trust for 27 years, retires from the \u00a3110,000-plus post at the end of the month. </p> <p>Although she does not officially start until January, Ms Reynolds has already embarked on a punishing schedule of visits to properties, from tin mines in Cornwall to a lighthouse on the north-east coast. She disagrees with the idea of the trust handing over some of its enormous wealth to other charities, but does applaud the increasing practice of working in partnership. \"I've been struck by how we are almost acting like an RDA [regional development agency] or an investment agency, because we raise money through a whole range of mechanisms, including from our members, and then distribute it around the country.\" </p> <p>Ms Reynolds is very definite about the trust's number one stakeholder. \"I have a very clear view that the people to whom the trust is accountable are the public. It was founded in 1895 for public benefit.\" However, she acknowledges the \"crucial\" role of members and points to some evidence that the membership is getting younger. Reasons for joining are also becoming more environmental, rather than to gain a season ticket to land and properties. </p> <p>Ms Reynolds would also like to capitalise on increasing public interest in the quality of food and organic production. \"We are quite interested in the marketing of rare breeds or other forms of products from the land that we can show have been farmed sensitively. One thing that is certain - the issue of environmental responsibility has been rising up the agenda in the trust for the last 20-30 years. We have been making tremendous efforts to show that we think and act as green as we can.\" </p> <p>Ms Reynolds borders on evangelical with her vision for the future. \"Our dependence on volunteers is extraordinary - there are just under 4,000 full-time staff in the trust but nearly 40,000 volunteers - half the work the trust does is done by volunteers, which is an extraordinary figure. The trust sees providing opportunities and rewarding volunteers as one of the main ways it can get its job done and involve people and help spread the message about what the trust does. </p> <p>\"Inclusiveness is a very 'pc' word, but actually a very meaningful one, and it is very important for an organisation like the trust. It is an amazing thing to have been here for 100 years and I want to make sure it lasts another 100 when all of us will be gone. And the reason it will be is because we have tapped into the hearts and minds of people. This is what will provide it with the sustenance to ensure its survival.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The woman set to take the helm of the National Trust claims not to have a personal view on hunting. Yet the hunting bill was one of the priorities in the Queen's speech and the trust still allows hunting on its land. Fiona Reynolds, the 42-year-old director-general designate, insists that \"my challenge is to look at a whole range of other things\". These things include managing one of Britain's largest charities with more than 2.5m members, 612,000 acres of land and 600 miles of coastline. On top of this, there is the upkeep of 250 historic houses, gardens and industrial buildings and 60m visitors a year to entertain. Annual expenditure on conservation and maintenance is \u00a3148m. Sitting in an armchair at the trust's headquarters overlooking St James Park in London, Ms Reynolds appears feisty, full of energy and ready to shake off the dusty image of the 105-year-old charity. \"The trust has to some extent a caricature image, not necessarily a negative one, but an image of grand country houses,\" she says. \"Whereas the breadth of what we do in relation to the countryside, and the huge responsibility as a land manager, mean we should be seen as a much more influential body. \"I'm hoping to draw together some clear ambitions for the trust, including the leadership role we can play in relation to the countryside and regeneration of land.\" One of Ms Reynolds's key concerns is what she sees as a general resignation that the countryside is in crisis. \"I think the trust has a really powerful role to play in helping to find solutions. Our experience of investing in solutions which are economically viable, as well as environmentally and socially sustainable, gives us the opportunity to show other landowners and people in the countryside what is possible.\" Ms Reynolds, a married mother of three, talks as if she has been part of the National Trust furniture for a long time. In fact she has, joining a regional committee in her early 20s - \"probably one of the youngest ever\", she lets slip. Along with a local group called the Save Sutton House campaign, she fought successfully for the trust to restore the rare Tudor house it owned in Hackney, east London. At the time, it was boarded up and inhabited by squatters and the trust was at a loss to know what to do. Ms Reynolds and her team fulfilled a vision of making it accessible for community use and education. \"We wanted to make it a place where children could come in and really explore.\" She is also proud of her campaigning role at the Council for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE), where she was director from 1992-98 and tackled issues such as housing development, energy supply and transport. At the end of her tenure, she was awarded a CBE for services to agro-environment and conservation. As well as her experience of campaigning on countryside issues, Ms Reynolds has just spent two years on the inside track of government as director of the women's unit at the Cabinet Office. \"That experience was enormously important, understanding how policy is made and implemented and working on issues that cut across different departments,\" she says. Although she was happy there, a friend spotted the National Trust's advertisement for a new director-general - a bait she found \"pretty irresistible\". The incumbent, Martin Drury, who has been with the trust for 27 years, retires from the \u00a3110,000-plus post at the end of the month. Although she does not officially start until January, Ms Reynolds has already embarked on a punishing schedule of visits to properties, from tin mines in Cornwall to a lighthouse on the north-east coast. She disagrees with the idea of the trust handing over some of its enormous wealth to other charities, but does applaud the increasing practice of working in partnership. \"I've been struck by how we are almost acting like an RDA [regional development agency] or an investment agency, because we raise money through a whole range of mechanisms, including from our members, and then distribute it around the country.\" Ms Reynolds is very definite about the trust's number one stakeholder. \"I have a very clear view that the people to whom the trust is accountable are the public. It was founded in 1895 for public benefit.\" However, she acknowledges the \"crucial\" role of members and points to some evidence that the membership is getting younger. Reasons for joining are also becoming more environmental, rather than to gain a season ticket to land and properties. Ms Reynolds would also like to capitalise on increasing public interest in the quality of food and organic production. \"We are quite interested in the marketing of rare breeds or other forms of products from the land that we can show have been farmed sensitively. One thing that is certain - the issue of environmental responsibility has been rising up the agenda in the trust for the last 20-30 years. We have been making tremendous efforts to show that we think and act as green as we can.\" Ms Reynolds borders on evangelical with her vision for the future. \"Our dependence on volunteers is extraordinary - there are just under 4,000 full-time staff in the trust but nearly 40,000 volunteers - half the work the trust does is done by volunteers, which is an extraordinary figure. The trust sees providing opportunities and rewarding volunteers as one of the main ways it can get its job done and involve people and help spread the message about what the trust does. \"Inclusiveness is a very 'pc' word, but actually a very meaningful one, and it is very important for an organisation like the trust. It is an amazing thing to have been here for 100 years and I want to make sure it lasts another 100 when all of us will be gone. And the reason it will be is because we have tapped into the hearts and minds of people. This is what will provide it with the sustenance to ensure its survival.\"",

      "body": "<p>It's becoming received wisdom that too many cancer charities are competing for money. Breast cancer is increasingly a politicised issue. So what significant impact can a small breast cancer organisation hope to make?</p> <p>\"We are a specialist organisation with a grassroots approach,\" explained Elisabeth Davies, director of the UK Breast Cancer Coalition (UKBCC). \"We equip people with the knowledge of how the NHS works, the concepts behind the acronyms, and then look at what is needed locally.\"</p> <p>This advocacy model has its roots in the National Breast Cancer Coalition, based in Washington, DC. \"Patients in the States are far more consumers within the healthcare process, and are happy to call themselves advocates,\" said Ms Davies. \"Here, people are more likely just to say, 'I know about this'.\"</p> <p>As part of enabling individuals to lobby for change, UKBCC recently became the first organisation to offer online campaign support through the interactive site Advocacy Online. \"A key question for campaigners now,\" said Advocacy Online's Mark Flanagan, \"is how to connect individuals with decision makers. The most credible organisations' campaigns will be those where individuals can speak for their own interests.\"</p> <p>Individuals have always been at the heart of UKBCC, founded in 1995 from six women's personal experiences of breast cancer. When they compared their treatments, they were shocked by the unfairness of access to services.</p> <p>Even with clear aims, the foundation years were sometimes difficult. \"When people have become involved precisely because they want to be active, it's alienating suddenly to find that board meetings are taken up by the details of a constitution and procedures,\" explained Ms Davies, then a volunteer with the coalition. \"But you absolutely have to do it.\"</p> <p>After three years the coalition had around 1,000 members, but frustratingly few resources. \"We were all volunteers,\" said Ms Davies. \"We couldn't invest the time to turn members from passive supporters into active advocates.\"</p> <p>October 1998 proved a turning point for the group, which now has pharmaceuticals company Roche among its corporate supporters. High-profile events staged with support from the Daily Express attracted investment, and enabled the coalition to recruit for the first time. It put strategic support before administration, and appointed Ms Davies as its first director. </p> <p>Two years later, the coalition has 3,000 supporters and 500 active advocates, and growth is bringing new challenges.</p> <p>Close relations with advocates are central to the organisation, which currently has personal contact with all active members. \"We have to maintain that as we grow,\" insisted Ms Davies, \"because we're asking a lot of people.\" Communication is designed to ensure that the organisation remains patient-focused, and its constitution includes the unusual specification that a majority of board members must have personal experience of breast cancer.</p> <p>But the strength of personal experience needs to be set in a broader context, the coalition argues. It works to develop advocates' objectivity, and is wary of relying on personal experience at the expense of organisational development. </p> <p>\"I know the fact that my mother died of breast cancer is a good story for journalists,\" said Ms Davies. \"But internally we try to be very inclusive. It has to be that you bring skills but you share them, so that when you're no longer there, the direction still is.\"</p> <p>The key challenge now is to promote further development of grassroots advocacy: personal, well-informed pressure for change. Can it flourish in the UK? Many would argue that at least a breeze of change is stirring in the NHS, with a new language of reform and the establishment of patient advocacy and liaison services. Its time may have come.</p> <p>\u0095 Kate Wilkinson is a communications consultant.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's becoming received wisdom that too many cancer charities are competing for money. Breast cancer is increasingly a politicised issue. So what significant impact can a small breast cancer organisation hope to make? \"We are a specialist organisation with a grassroots approach,\" explained Elisabeth Davies, director of the UK Breast Cancer Coalition (UKBCC). \"We equip people with the knowledge of how the NHS works, the concepts behind the acronyms, and then look at what is needed locally.\" This advocacy model has its roots in the National Breast Cancer Coalition, based in Washington, DC. \"Patients in the States are far more consumers within the healthcare process, and are happy to call themselves advocates,\" said Ms Davies. \"Here, people are more likely just to say, 'I know about this'.\" As part of enabling individuals to lobby for change, UKBCC recently became the first organisation to offer online campaign support through the interactive site Advocacy Online. \"A key question for campaigners now,\" said Advocacy Online's Mark Flanagan, \"is how to connect individuals with decision makers. The most credible organisations' campaigns will be those where individuals can speak for their own interests.\" Individuals have always been at the heart of UKBCC, founded in 1995 from six women's personal experiences of breast cancer. When they compared their treatments, they were shocked by the unfairness of access to services. Even with clear aims, the foundation years were sometimes difficult. \"When people have become involved precisely because they want to be active, it's alienating suddenly to find that board meetings are taken up by the details of a constitution and procedures,\" explained Ms Davies, then a volunteer with the coalition. \"But you absolutely have to do it.\" After three years the coalition had around 1,000 members, but frustratingly few resources. \"We were all volunteers,\" said Ms Davies. \"We couldn't invest the time to turn members from passive supporters into active advocates.\" October 1998 proved a turning point for the group, which now has pharmaceuticals company Roche among its corporate supporters. High-profile events staged with support from the Daily Express attracted investment, and enabled the coalition to recruit for the first time. It put strategic support before administration, and appointed Ms Davies as its first director. Two years later, the coalition has 3,000 supporters and 500 active advocates, and growth is bringing new challenges. Close relations with advocates are central to the organisation, which currently has personal contact with all active members. \"We have to maintain that as we grow,\" insisted Ms Davies, \"because we're asking a lot of people.\" Communication is designed to ensure that the organisation remains patient-focused, and its constitution includes the unusual specification that a majority of board members must have personal experience of breast cancer. But the strength of personal experience needs to be set in a broader context, the coalition argues. It works to develop advocates' objectivity, and is wary of relying on personal experience at the expense of organisational development. \"I know the fact that my mother died of breast cancer is a good story for journalists,\" said Ms Davies. \"But internally we try to be very inclusive. It has to be that you bring skills but you share them, so that when you're no longer there, the direction still is.\" The key challenge now is to promote further development of grassroots advocacy: personal, well-informed pressure for change. Can it flourish in the UK? Many would argue that at least a breeze of change is stirring in the NHS, with a new language of reform and the establishment of patient advocacy and liaison services. Its time may have come. \u0095 Kate Wilkinson is a communications consultant.",

      "bodyText": "Blood transfusions are \"extremely safe\", despite evidence that at least 14 people have died in the past seven years as a result of receiving unsafe blood during operations, says a government auditor. The National Audit Office (NAO) said the National Blood Service has taken \"effective measures\" to ensure blood safety, despite public fears over theoretical risks of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). It also reported that the service fully met demand from hospitals for blood products in 1999-00 - a significant improvement on the previous year, when shortages caused many hospitals to cancel operations. But although blood donations from the public currently meet demand, it says there is a risk that collections \"may decline\" and more should be done to make it easier for the public to donate, including shortening the length of time it takes to give blood. A survey of public attitudes to donation found that most people accepted that there was a \"continuing need to give blood\" and that the service therefore \"did not have to put a lot of effort into selling the merits of giving blood\". It also found that the principle of giving blood for free was still strong. Only 1% of those people who did not donate, or who had lapsed, said they would be attracted back by payment. The blood service believes that seven verifiable deaths due to unsafe transfusions of blood were reported between 1993 and 1998, when around 5m transfusions took place. A separate report quoted by the audit office, published in April 2000 by the Serious Hazards of Transfusion Group, said seven deaths were \"definitely attributed\" to transfusion during 1998-99, two of which were due to contamination. The blood service has spent \u00a360m a year since 1998 introducing a process called leucodepletion, which removes white cells from blood to reduce the risk of infection from variant CJD. The audit office report said that the blood service, which until 1994 was split into several regional authorities, was now fully integrated into a national service. It said that since the reorganisation, the service's performance of collecting blood from donors and delivering it to hospitals \"is as good as, and in many areas, better\" than before.",

      "body": "<p>The Sahara has crossed the Mediterranean, forcing thousands to migrate as a lethal combination of soil degradation and climate change turns parts of southern Europe into desert. </p> <p>A major UN conference was told yesterday that up to a third of Europe's soil could eventually be affected. </p> <p>A fifth of Spanish land is so degraded that it is turning into desert, according to figures released for the first time yesterday, and in Italy tracts of land in the south are now abandoned and technically desert. </p> <p>Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece are the four EU countries already so badly affected that they have joined the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD) which is meeting in Bonn this week. </p> <p>One expert, Maurizio Sciortino, said that there were many causes of the soil degradation, including changing weather patterns and the rise of global farming, which is making it uneconomic to run smallholdings and is driving people from the land. </p> <p>\"Land that has been carefully cultivated and preserved for 2,000 years, with terracing for soil conservation and careful irrigation to keep up productivity, is being abandoned and lost,\" he said. \"The walls of the terracing break down, the soil is washed away and we are left with bare rock. Once that happens there is no way back. </p> <p>\"The conditions are particularly bad in southern Italy, Spain and Greece. Even southern France is not immune but so far they do not admit it for political reasons.\" </p> <p>The problem is not confined to the EU. Bulgaria, Hungary, Moldova, Romania and Russia have all reported signs of desertification. Experts say Moldova in particular is \"highly vulnerable\" to desertification, with about 60% its farmland degraded. </p> <p>Beyond the Black Sea, there are belts of fast-degrading land stretching as far as Mongolia. China, for example, has said that land deterioration in its northern provinces is costing its economy \u00a34bn a year. </p> <p>In places such as drought-stricken Sardinia and Sicily, economic conditions are accelerating the problem. \"In many places tourism is making things far worse,\" Mr Sciortino said. </p> <p>\"Water is pumped from below ground, pulling salt water from the sea into the aquifers.

      "bodyText": "The Sahara has crossed the Mediterranean, forcing thousands to migrate as a lethal combination of soil degradation and climate change turns parts of southern Europe into desert. A major UN conference was told yesterday that up to a third of Europe's soil could eventually be affected. A fifth of Spanish land is so degraded that it is turning into desert, according to figures released for the first time yesterday, and in Italy tracts of land in the south are now abandoned and technically desert. Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece are the four EU countries already so badly affected that they have joined the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD) which is meeting in Bonn this week. One expert, Maurizio Sciortino, said that there were many causes of the soil degradation, including changing weather patterns and the rise of global farming, which is making it uneconomic to run smallholdings and is driving people from the land. \"Land that has been carefully cultivated and preserved for 2,000 years, with terracing for soil conservation and careful irrigation to keep up productivity, is being abandoned and lost,\" he said. \"The walls of the terracing break down, the soil is washed away and we are left with bare rock. Once that happens there is no way back. \"The conditions are particularly bad in southern Italy, Spain and Greece. Even southern France is not immune but so far they do not admit it for political reasons.\" The problem is not confined to the EU. Bulgaria, Hungary, Moldova, Romania and Russia have all reported signs of desertification. Experts say Moldova in particular is \"highly vulnerable\" to desertification, with about 60% its farmland degraded. Beyond the Black Sea, there are belts of fast-degrading land stretching as far as Mongolia. China, for example, has said that land deterioration in its northern provinces is costing its economy \u00a34bn a year. In places such as drought-stricken Sardinia and Sicily, economic conditions are accelerating the problem. \"In many places tourism is making things far worse,\" Mr Sciortino said. \"Water is pumped from below ground, pulling salt water from the sea into the aquifers. Imagine how much water it takes to keep an 18-hole golf course going for the tourists. The trouble is they use the money to buy petrol to drive the desalination plants for more water and that makes global warming worse. In the end it means more deserts. We have to stop this cycle.\" Italy has a programme of helping the countries of North Africa to combat desertification, partly in order to stem the increasing tide of refugees attempting to reach Europe. Valareo Calzolaio, the Italian environment minister, said that at first people migrated from the country to the cities and then \"toward remote western mirages - migrants fall to the network of criminal traders in human beings.\" He is also concerned about the a rise in the number of refugees from the east: \"If we do not take urgent action then within 10 years millions will be forced to migrate from their degraded land and they will be heading for Europe.\" Klaus T\u00f6pfer, the former German environment minister who is now executive director of the UN Environment Programme, said: \"Although often overlooked, soil is a natural resource that is no less important to human wellbeing and the environment than clean water and clean air, the two things that most people in the EU have been focusing on. \"The sustainable use of soil is one of Europe's greatest environmental, social and economic challenges.\" Domingo Jimenez-Beltran, executive director of the European Environment Agency, said: \"In some parts of Europe, the degradation is so severe that it has reduced the soil's capacity to support human communities and ecosystems and resulted in desertification.

If we had 100 times as much money we could do 100 similar schemes to push back the deserts.\" However, Mr Diallo said it was difficult to attract finance for such small local schemes. Action Plan At this year's Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD), countries in southern Europe produced action plans to deal with: \u2022 Seasonal droughts, very high rainfall variability and sudden high-intensity rainfall \u2022 Poor, highly erodable soil, prone to surface crusts \u2022 Crisis conditions in traditional agriculture with associated land abandonment \u2022 An increase in forest fires \u2022 Concentration of economic activity in coastal areas",

After rising 57p to \u00a315.95 yesterday, its stock price has improved almost \u00a38 since the deal was completed. In the past six months its shares have outperformed the FTSE All-Share index by 27%. </p> <p>The reason is simple: Royal Bank has delivered the promised benefits of the deal and it has not been shy about telling people. </p> <p>Royal Bank is heading into its quiet period ahead of full-year figures in March and has been busy briefing analysts on the merits of the deal. </p> <p>One broker to recently receive a visit from Royal Bank's top brass was SG Securities. In a note published yesterday, SG analyst John Tyce predicted that Royal Bank would have no difficulty demonstrating a substantial improvement NatWest's cost/income ratio by 2002. </p> <p>Furthermore, Mr Tyce reckoned there is still upside to be had from working the NatWest franchise even harder - potentially a \u00a3300m upgrade to his pretax profits forecasts for 2003. All of which could justify a share price of \u00a320.60 in Mr Tyce's opinion, something <strong> Lloyds TSB</strong> might want to note. Its shares closed 10p higher at 725p, nearly 60p off their year's high. </p> <p>The whole banking sector was in positive territory yesterday. The Asia-focused banks - <strong> HSBC</strong>, up 38p to \u00a310.10, and <strong> Standard Chartered</strong>, 4p higher at 950p - fared particularly well. Both were lifted by hopes Fed chairman Alan Greenspan might abandon his leaning toward higher interest rates.

      "bodyText": "If Lloyds TSB needs reassurance on the merits of, making a bid hostile or otherwise, for Abbey National, which was up 13p to \u00a311.84 yesterday, then it might want to cast an eye over the recent performance Royal Bank of Scotland. Since winning the battle for control of NatWest in March, the bank has seen its reputation in the Square Mile go from strength to strength. After rising 57p to \u00a315.95 yesterday, its stock price has improved almost \u00a38 since the deal was completed. In the past six months its shares have outperformed the FTSE All-Share index by 27%. The reason is simple: Royal Bank has delivered the promised benefits of the deal and it has not been shy about telling people. Royal Bank is heading into its quiet period ahead of full-year figures in March and has been busy briefing analysts on the merits of the deal. One broker to recently receive a visit from Royal Bank's top brass was SG Securities. In a note published yesterday, SG analyst John Tyce predicted that Royal Bank would have no difficulty demonstrating a substantial improvement NatWest's cost/income ratio by 2002. Furthermore, Mr Tyce reckoned there is still upside to be had from working the NatWest franchise even harder - potentially a \u00a3300m upgrade to his pretax profits forecasts for 2003. All of which could justify a share price of \u00a320.60 in Mr Tyce's opinion, something Lloyds TSB might want to note. Its shares closed 10p higher at 725p, nearly 60p off their year's high. The whole banking sector was in positive territory yesterday. The Asia-focused banks - HSBC, up 38p to \u00a310.10, and Standard Chartered, 4p higher at 950p - fared particularly well. Both were lifted by hopes Fed chairman Alan Greenspan might abandon his leaning toward higher interest rates. That also assisted Barclays, up 20p to \u00a321.13, and Halifax, 28.5p better at 671.5p. All of which assisted the FTSE 100 index of leading shares to recover from an early 47 point decline to end the day 48.5 stronger at 6,295. Oil group Shell, up 21.5p to 534.5p, also gave the index a boost as analysts belatedly welcomed Monday's half-yearly update.

But he said: 'We haven't said anything about this and we don't think it would be helpful to do so.' I agree with what he said to us in September. I do not think it is helpful.\"</p> <p>The bishop said Mr Hague was wrong to criticise the report which had transformed relations between the police and members of ethnic minorities. \"Yes there are fewer numbers [of police] but they are policing with the greater support from the community and therefore they are getting the intelligence,\" he said.</p> <p>His remarks were an embarrassing blow to Mr Hague who sparked a storm when he said Sir William Macpherson's description of the Metropolitan police as institutionally racist had led to a collapse in police morale.</p> <p>Tory officials last night angrily rejected the bishop's claim. Central Office produced a written note of the meeting in which Mr Hague reportedly gave no assurance on his stance.</p> <p>The decision to release minutes of a private meeting demonstrated the determination of Mr Hague to hit back at criticisms of his views on crime. He surprised many Tories on Monday when he dismissed calls for restraint from Damilola Taylor's parents to warn that another Labour government would lead to more tragedies in the inner cities.</p> <p>The bishop, whose diocese covers Peckham, where Damilola was killed, said it was \"foolish\" to link falling police numbers to Damilola's death. \"With this particular crime, we don't know what happened. It is very foolish to speculate.\"</p> <p>The commission for racial equality is to write to the political parties expressing its fear that the row over police numbers, stop and search and the murder of Damilola will break the political consensus not to use the race card in the election.</p> <p>The CRE chairman, Gurbux Singh, has been in private talks with the parties to persuade them to again sign the compact they agreed prior to the 1997 general election.

      "bodyText": "William Hague suffered a damaging blow yesterday when a Church of England bishop accused him of reneging on a commitment to refrain from making political capital out of the Macpherson report. Tom Butler, the Bishop of Southwark, expressed surprise that the Tory leader had criticised the report months after assuring a group of church leaders that he would accept Sir William Macpherson's findings into the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence. In an interview with Radio 4's Today programme, the bishop said Mr Hague had been \"very firm\" during the meeting in September that the Tories would not play the race card. \"William Hague actually raised the question of the Macpherson report and said that some people were critical. But he said: 'We haven't said anything about this and we don't think it would be helpful to do so.' I agree with what he said to us in September. I do not think it is helpful.\" The bishop said Mr Hague was wrong to criticise the report which had transformed relations between the police and members of ethnic minorities. \"Yes there are fewer numbers [of police] but they are policing with the greater support from the community and therefore they are getting the intelligence,\" he said. His remarks were an embarrassing blow to Mr Hague who sparked a storm when he said Sir William Macpherson's description of the Metropolitan police as institutionally racist had led to a collapse in police morale. Tory officials last night angrily rejected the bishop's claim. Central Office produced a written note of the meeting in which Mr Hague reportedly gave no assurance on his stance. The decision to release minutes of a private meeting demonstrated the determination of Mr Hague to hit back at criticisms of his views on crime. He surprised many Tories on Monday when he dismissed calls for restraint from Damilola Taylor's parents to warn that another Labour government would lead to more tragedies in the inner cities. The bishop, whose diocese covers Peckham, where Damilola was killed, said it was \"foolish\" to link falling police numbers to Damilola's death. \"With this particular crime, we don't know what happened. It is very foolish to speculate.\" The commission for racial equality is to write to the political parties expressing its fear that the row over police numbers, stop and search and the murder of Damilola will break the political consensus not to use the race card in the election. The CRE chairman, Gurbux Singh, has been in private talks with the parties to persuade them to again sign the compact they agreed prior to the 1997 general election. The compact was a publicly agreed understanding that no party would use raceto gain votes.",

In a surprising twist, Wiltshire police officers, who have been investigating chemical warfare experiments on humans, are referring back to the local coroner the death of Ronald Maddison, 20. The move implies that detectives believe the misadventure verdict of the original inquest, held in secret in 1953, was wrong. Only a handful of inquests are reopened in any year. Ultimately, it is up to the high court, with the consent of the attorney general after a report from the coroner, to decide whether to hold a new inquest. For months a Wiltshire police squad has been investigating the death which happened during the cold war at the Ministry of Defence's Porton Down chemical warfare establishment near Salisbury. Yesterday, Alan Care of the solicitors Russell Jones and Walker said on behalf of the Maddison family: \"The only reason I can see to reopen this inquest is for the coroner and jury to consider an unlawful killing verdict. I cannot envisage anything more serious for the MoD who ran Porton Down for many years.\" Maddison was part of an experiment involving 396 men which was aimed at establishing the amount of nerve gas which when applied to the clothed or bare skin of men would cause incapacitation or death. But the experiment went tragically wrong when he died 40 minutes after liquid nerve gas was deliberately dripped on to his arm by Porton scientists in a gas chamber. Ten days after his death, an inquest was held behind closed doors \"in the interests of national security\". Only officials and Maddison's father were allowed to attend, but he was sworn to secrecy by the authorities. According to his family, he never told his wife or any relatives what he heard in the secret inquest. Porton Down now admits that the government hushed up details of the death as it wanted to hide from the public the extent of the human experiments and British work on nerve gas during the cold war. The coroner's papers on the death have never been published. A fresh inquest would almost certainly be held in public. More than 20,000 human guinea pigs have taken part in experiments at Porton Down since 1916.

Mr Hague, who was criticised this week for linking his attacks on home office policy to the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor, resumed his offensive asking the prime minister if he agreed police morale was low. Mr Blair, during the last prime minister's question time before Christmas, responded that the main reason for low morale was the previous government's cutting of the police's housing allowance. Mr Hague reprised his opinion that the police had been undermined by the Macpherson report into the killing of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence, and that its effectiveness has been curtailed by fears at stopping and searching people from minority groups. However, Mr Blair said: \"I said after the Macpherson report that it is extremely important for police to continue to use their stop and search powers\u0085 these powers are still in use.

The prime minister said that his was the party investing in the police and demanded Mr Hague reveal whether he intended to match the government's level of investment. Mr Hague said the prime minister was \"off his head\" if he thought the Conservatives would cut policing budgets. The Tory leader began his attack on the government's crime policy with an accusation that its electronic tagging policy had led to 1,000 crimes being committed, including two rapes by people released early and tagged. Mr Blair said that while it was true some crimes had been committed, tagging was an additional resource and that all governments, including the opposition's, used early release schemes. Mr Hague said: \"There has been no clearer demonstration of this government's complacency on crime.\" During question time there was a disturbance in the public gallery as a protestor, reportedly a foreign national, shouted down onto the Commons but was ignored by Mr Blair as he delivered his answers.

Well, there's been nobody in the office for the last two days except for muggins. Everybody's nominally at work, of course, but as soon as they get in, they're all off to the bars in the City before you can say \"open it carefully and don't forget your credit card\". But me? I've got to stay here and keep an eye on developments at Tottenham Hotspur, where Daniel Levy, season ticketholder and head of sports and leisure group English National Investment Company, is about to buy 27% of Alan Sugar's 40% share in the club for \u00a322m.</p> <p>Formal announcements could even be made to the Stock Exchange later today. Why couldn't they do it in the morning, eh? I had plans to pop a couple of corks with a lap dancer, I mean my business partner, in a hotel room this lunchtime. Y'buggers! As if I give two hoots about Levy, who now has a 30% controlling interest in the club and will become executive director while looking to appoint a new chairman. Gah!</p> <p>And what was the point of getting rid of that Sugar bloke anyway? This Enic lot - who already own major stakes in Rangers, Vicenza and Slavia Prague - aren't even going to get their moolah out. \"Enic's philosophy has never been to throw money at clubs,\" Oliver Butler, the editor of football business magazine Soccer Investor, told the London Evening Standard today. \"Spurs might be different because they're a big club but they've still got shareholders to answer to and are unlikely to alter their approach.\" So why did they keep me here and ruin my Christmas? Sob!</p> <p><strong>ADVERTISMENT</strong></p> <p>HSBC's Internet Bank never closes. It is always open for business so home or away, you're winning. Register today at <a href=\"http://www.hsbc.co.uk/ebank\">www.hsbc.co.uk/ebank</a></p> <p><strong>MANU IS LIMP</strong></p> <p>The Fiver was feeling a touch melancholy earlier today. For a change, it wasn't because we feared for the state of the planet, or for our non-existent love life, or for MP Keith Vaz's belly - which we make an even-money favourite to explode on Boxing Day. No, the cause of our sorrow was our old adversary He Was He Is Emmanuel Petit, whose depression is now so severe that his once proud pony-tail hangs limply in the Barcelona air.</p> <p>And our thoughts darkened when we heard Rivaldo was also fuming at the way He Was He Is has been treated. \"We make him come to Barcelona where he doesn't play or not at his best post,\" he sobbed. \"He is sad, it is natural.\" But at lunchtime, relief seemed at hand. Teamtalk reported that cunning old Egyptian fox Mohammed Al-Fulham was planning a Harrods deposit-box style raid on the Catalan capital. His target? None other than one unappreciated Frenchman whose favourite book is the Celestine Prophecy!</p> <p>It all seemed to make sense: \u00a38m for Petit sounded like a reasonable price, and Teamtalk backed it up by quoting \"insiders\" at Fulham who claimed a deal was \"a real possibility\". Unfortunately, those insiders don't answer to everyone's favourite PR king Max Clifford, who this afternoon told the Fiver: \"There's no truth in it at all. Fulham have not spoken to Barcelona or Mr Petit.\" And then, in a flash, after bidding us a fond Christmas, the busy PR guru was gone. You don't think Santa's got involved in a scrape with a pop star and a Ferrari, do you?</p> <p><strong>THE FIVER'S INTERACTIVE ADVENT CALENDAR</strong></p> <p>Dec 20: <a href=\"http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,413910,00.html\">Click here</a></p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I'd heard of Chris de Burgh before I came over to England. He's very famous in Holland and all over the world. I must admit I was amazed at how many of his songs I knew because I thought I only knew Lady in Red and Revolution.

But our favourites will always be Laurel and Hardy - they were the greatest. So imagine how happy we were when we heard about a Teesside duo who faithfully replicate Stan and Ollie's greatest moments. Guffaw as the big overweight bloke gives out some orders and shakes his head sadly! Roar as his little confused chum stands in a pile of rubble, close to tears, scratching his head!</p> <p>\"Both of us are very comfortable with the roles we have,\" quipped little Bryan Robson as he slipped on a bar of soap, skidded through several rooms and yanked a set of curtains from the wall. \"Terry's picking the team and taking the training so I can be more relaxed and do other things. There are plenty of things to do around a football club,\" the loveable funster chirruped before accidentally stepping on a shovel and giving himself two black eyes.</p> <p>\"I knew we would work well together,\" Robbo screamed, as both men carried a grandfather clock across a busy road. \"Terry doesn't have an ego and I haven't got an ego. People questioned Terry's commitment to the club, but they have all been proved wrong.\" Watch out for that model T coming round the corn... crash, clang, etc. and so on.</p> <p>\"That's why Terry was so annoyed when he read all these stories claiming he had flown straight back to London after the match at Sunderland,\" concluded little Bry, picking himself up and dusting himself down. \"He spent the whole weekend looking for a house and he has found one. He moved in this week.\" Oh, Bryan!

Formal announcements could even be made to the Stock Exchange later today. Why couldn't they do it in the morning, eh? I had plans to pop a couple of corks with a lap dancer, I mean my business partner, in a hotel room this lunchtime. Y'buggers! As if I give two hoots about Levy, who now has a 30% controlling interest in the club and will become executive director while looking to appoint a new chairman. Gah! And what was the point of getting rid of that Sugar bloke anyway? This Enic lot - who already own major stakes in Rangers, Vicenza and Slavia Prague - aren't even going to get their moolah out. \"Enic's philosophy has never been to throw money at clubs,\" Oliver Butler, the editor of football business magazine Soccer Investor, told the London Evening Standard today. \"Spurs might be different because they're a big club but they've still got shareholders to answer to and are unlikely to alter their approach.\" So why did they keep me here and ruin my Christmas? Sob! ADVERTISMENT HSBC's Internet Bank never closes. It is always open for business so home or away, you're winning.

For a change, it wasn't because we feared for the state of the planet, or for our non-existent love life, or for MP Keith Vaz's belly - which we make an even-money favourite to explode on Boxing Day. No, the cause of our sorrow was our old adversary He Was He Is Emmanuel Petit, whose depression is now so severe that his once proud pony-tail hangs limply in the Barcelona air. And our thoughts darkened when we heard Rivaldo was also fuming at the way He Was He Is has been treated. \"We make him come to Barcelona where he doesn't play or not at his best post,\" he sobbed. \"He is sad, it is natural.\" But at lunchtime, relief seemed at hand. Teamtalk reported that cunning old Egyptian fox Mohammed Al-Fulham was planning a Harrods deposit-box style raid on the Catalan capital. His target? None other than one unappreciated Frenchman whose favourite book is the Celestine Prophecy! It all seemed to make sense: \u00a38m for Petit sounded like a reasonable price, and Teamtalk backed it up by quoting \"insiders\" at Fulham who claimed a deal was \"a real possibility\". Unfortunately, those insiders don't answer to everyone's favourite PR king Max Clifford, who this afternoon told the Fiver: \"There's no truth in it at all. Fulham have not spoken to Barcelona or Mr Petit.\" And then, in a flash, after bidding us a fond Christmas, the busy PR guru was gone. You don't think Santa's got involved in a scrape with a pop star and a Ferrari, do you? THE FIVER'S INTERACTIVE ADVENT CALENDAR Dec 20: Click here QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I'd heard of Chris de Burgh before I came over to England. He's very famous in Holland and all over the world. I must admit I was amazed at how many of his songs I knew because I thought I only knew Lady in Red and Revolution. We met him afterwards in the VIP room where we thanked him for his concert because we'd had a really good time\" - Sander Westerveld's big night out. WHAT AN AMUSING DOUBLE ACT Cannon and Ball, Little and Large, sinister drag artistes The Krankies... the Fiver loves a double act. But our favourites will always be Laurel and Hardy - they were the greatest. So imagine how happy we were when we heard about a Teesside duo who faithfully replicate Stan and Ollie's greatest moments. Guffaw as the big overweight bloke gives out some orders and shakes his head sadly! Roar as his little confused chum stands in a pile of rubble, close to tears, scratching his head! \"Both of us are very comfortable with the roles we have,\" quipped little Bryan Robson as he slipped on a bar of soap, skidded through several rooms and yanked a set of curtains from the wall. \"Terry's picking the team and taking the training so I can be more relaxed and do other things. There are plenty of things to do around a football club,\" the loveable funster chirruped before accidentally stepping on a shovel and giving himself two black eyes. \"I knew we would work well together,\" Robbo screamed, as both men carried a grandfather clock across a busy road. \"Terry doesn't have an ego and I haven't got an ego. People questioned Terry's commitment to the club, but they have all been proved wrong.\" Watch out for that model T coming round the corn... crash, clang, etc. and so on. \"That's why Terry was so annoyed when he read all these stories claiming he had flown straight back to London after the match at Sunderland,\" concluded little Bry, picking himself up and dusting himself down. \"He spent the whole weekend looking for a house and he has found one. He moved in this week.\" Oh, Bryan! That's another fine mess you've got him into. THE RUMOUR MILL Arsenal want highly-rated Bordeaux keeper Ulrich Rame as the long-term successor to David Seaman. Paolo Maldini has admitted he would like to play in England. \"Somewhere like Chelsea appeals, as I have good friends there like Gianfranco Zola and Marcel Desailly,\" he said. NEWS IN BRIEF Aston Villa's Turkish defender Alpay will lay a wreath at Elland Road before Saturday's Premiership match with Leeds, as a gesture in memory of the two Leeds fans who died on the streets of Istanbul in April. Tottenham will today complete the signing of 18-year-old East Fife striker Steve Ferguson for a nominal fee, subject to a medical. Leicester have pledged to mount a \"vigorous defence\" of Matt Elliott after he was charged by the FA with using violent and threatening behaviour towards Coventry's Craig Bellamy. Paul Jewell faces a touchline ban after being charged with making \"insulting and abusive comments to match officials\" during Sheffield Wednesday's Worthington Cup quarter-final against Birmingham last week. Manchester United have been fined 5,000 Swiss Francs (about \u00a32,000) for \"improper conduct\" during their 3-1 Big Cup win against PSV Eindhoven. Uefa have banned Alan Smith for three under-21 matches after he was sent off while playing for the England side against Finland in October. Fernando Ricksen is considering an appeal against his two-game suspension for kicking Aberdeen midfielder Darren Young. Rangers director-secretary Campbell Ogilvie said: \"Within the SFA articles there is a right to appeal and it is up to the player if he wants to do so. Rest assured he is considering such an eventuality.\" Fourth Division Calais, shock finalists in last season's French Cup, have been drawn to meet First Division leaders Sedan in the competition's first round next month.

      "body": "<p>Poor old St Nicholas. According to legend, the fourth-century priest was a self-effacing chap who preferred to be out of the limelight. A dab hand at good works, he wasn't the sort of character who went looking for praise. So when he saw a pauper's family in dire need, he decided to climb on their roof and lob a few coins down the chimney by way of an anonymous gift. </p> <p>So far so good, but when the coins landed on a stocking drying in the fireplace the family heard the noise and discovered their philanthropic visitor. Alas for St Nick, far from slipping away quietly into the shadows, he earned himself a place in history: 16 centuries on, his name is known to children everywhere as the generous, cheery Christmas present-bearer. </p> <p>So far, so depressing for the bashful do-gooder, but now things have gone from bad to worse. A new poll reveals that, at the dawn of Christianity's third millennium, he has overtaken his boss as the embodiment of Yuletide. Of 1,200 eight-to-16-year-olds questioned by media buying agency MediaCom TMB, 67% said they associate this time of year with the red-suited, white-bearded version of St Nick, Santa Claus; only 8% link Christmas with Christ himself. </p> <p>At first sight, this would seem further confirmation that Christmas is crassly commercialised, merely materialistic. But irony piles on irony because, in this post-Christian age, there are signs that Father Christmas, the figure bequeathed us by St Nicholas, is achieving a quasi-religious status. This has gone so far that church leaders have now launched a campaign to end what they call \"the cult of Father Christmas\" and restore St Nicholas as the symbol of the festive season. Are we moving towards a time when Santa Claus is regarded as more sacred than God? </p> <p>This scenario might sound fanciful, but look at the outrage caused last week by the vicar who, during a school talk, thought he was doing no harm in mentioning to a group of seven-to-11-year-olds that \"Father Christmas doesn't really exist\". The Rev Clive Evans could not have imagined the storm of protest his aside would provoke: by the age of seven and eight, he evidently expected that most children would have worked out that a stocky OAP in fancy dress was unlikely to be able to squeeze down the flue of a \"burns as real\" gas fire with a bag of micro-scooters over his shoulder. Obviously his own son Simon, eight, is fully in the picture, and Evans assumed that everyone else's kid would be, too. </p> <p>How wrong he was. Within hours of Evans's clanger, lips were quivering all over the village of Long Buckby in Northamptonshire. Not the children's, of course: most of them took the news on the chin and merely rerouted their wish lists away from Santa's website and towards Dad's mobile phone. No, it was the parents who were devastated: they had hoped their little babes would still believe in Father Christmas at 18, presumably. Or at least until secondary school. </p> <p>\"He did upset a lot of people, I'm afraid,\" says Jeanette Goddard, head teacher of Long Buckby Junior School. \"And most of the comments came from parents - I think it's fair to say that the reference to Father Christmas passed a lot of the children by. But parents do get very irate about their children being told Father Christmas doesn't exist.\" </p> <p>Some people, she said, had also got annoyed about why the vicar had been allowed to address the school, which is non-denominational. \"But these days most children get so little religious input, if we didn't let the vicar talk to them, it would be missing from their lives completely.\" </p> <p>Why did the parents care so much? If the vicar had told the children there was no God, it is hard to imagine there would have been more of an outcry. Perhaps less: while some children are raised as non-believers in God, almost none are raised as non-believers in Father Christmas. It is no coincidence that Santa's stature has grown over the last four or five decades in inverse proportion to the decline of belief in God because, however happy we've all been to cast off the idea of deity and church, we are not quite so comfortable with the idea of bringing up children whose lives are untouched by spirituality. </p> <p>We love the idea that they believe in this godlike figure who sweeps through the whole world bringing good fortune to all because, in our hearts, we mourn the fact that we don't believe in him any more: we love the simplicity of the tale because, in an unfair and complex world, the story of Father Christmas is a powerful parable about equality, justice, and putting children first. </p> <p>\"I think most adults secretly would like to believe in Father Christmas, too.

      "bodyText": "Poor old St Nicholas. According to legend, the fourth-century priest was a self-effacing chap who preferred to be out of the limelight. A dab hand at good works, he wasn't the sort of character who went looking for praise. So when he saw a pauper's family in dire need, he decided to climb on their roof and lob a few coins down the chimney by way of an anonymous gift. So far so good, but when the coins landed on a stocking drying in the fireplace the family heard the noise and discovered their philanthropic visitor. Alas for St Nick, far from slipping away quietly into the shadows, he earned himself a place in history: 16 centuries on, his name is known to children everywhere as the generous, cheery Christmas present-bearer. So far, so depressing for the bashful do-gooder, but now things have gone from bad to worse. A new poll reveals that, at the dawn of Christianity's third millennium, he has overtaken his boss as the embodiment of Yuletide. Of 1,200 eight-to-16-year-olds questioned by media buying agency MediaCom TMB, 67% said they associate this time of year with the red-suited, white-bearded version of St Nick, Santa Claus; only 8% link Christmas with Christ himself. At first sight, this would seem further confirmation that Christmas is crassly commercialised, merely materialistic. But irony piles on irony because, in this post-Christian age, there are signs that Father Christmas, the figure bequeathed us by St Nicholas, is achieving a quasi-religious status. This has gone so far that church leaders have now launched a campaign to end what they call \"the cult of Father Christmas\" and restore St Nicholas as the symbol of the festive season. Are we moving towards a time when Santa Claus is regarded as more sacred than God? This scenario might sound fanciful, but look at the outrage caused last week by the vicar who, during a school talk, thought he was doing no harm in mentioning to a group of seven-to-11-year-olds that \"Father Christmas doesn't really exist\". The Rev Clive Evans could not have imagined the storm of protest his aside would provoke: by the age of seven and eight, he evidently expected that most children would have worked out that a stocky OAP in fancy dress was unlikely to be able to squeeze down the flue of a \"burns as real\" gas fire with a bag of micro-scooters over his shoulder. Obviously his own son Simon, eight, is fully in the picture, and Evans assumed that everyone else's kid would be, too. How wrong he was. Within hours of Evans's clanger, lips were quivering all over the village of Long Buckby in Northamptonshire. Not the children's, of course: most of them took the news on the chin and merely rerouted their wish lists away from Santa's website and towards Dad's mobile phone. No, it was the parents who were devastated: they had hoped their little babes would still believe in Father Christmas at 18, presumably. Or at least until secondary school. \"He did upset a lot of people, I'm afraid,\" says Jeanette Goddard, head teacher of Long Buckby Junior School. \"And most of the comments came from parents - I think it's fair to say that the reference to Father Christmas passed a lot of the children by. But parents do get very irate about their children being told Father Christmas doesn't exist.\" Some people, she said, had also got annoyed about why the vicar had been allowed to address the school, which is non-denominational. \"But these days most children get so little religious input, if we didn't let the vicar talk to them, it would be missing from their lives completely.\" Why did the parents care so much? If the vicar had told the children there was no God, it is hard to imagine there would have been more of an outcry. Perhaps less: while some children are raised as non-believers in God, almost none are raised as non-believers in Father Christmas. It is no coincidence that Santa's stature has grown over the last four or five decades in inverse proportion to the decline of belief in God because, however happy we've all been to cast off the idea of deity and church, we are not quite so comfortable with the idea of bringing up children whose lives are untouched by spirituality. We love the idea that they believe in this godlike figure who sweeps through the whole world bringing good fortune to all because, in our hearts, we mourn the fact that we don't believe in him any more: we love the simplicity of the tale because, in an unfair and complex world, the story of Father Christmas is a powerful parable about equality, justice, and putting children first. \"I think most adults secretly would like to believe in Father Christmas, too. I know I would,\" says mother-of-three Delia Perry. \"So, of course, you make a lot of it, and when they find out, you're a bit upset. My son Carl, who's 10, found out last year. I was very angry to discover that he was being teased by other children in his class over it.

It seems to represent a kind of primitive need in parents. It's almost like: how lovely that children can believe - and how awful that we grow out of it.\" Even parents who go to tortuous lengths to avoid lying to their children buy into the fib, backing it up with visits to a grotto and letters to Lapland.

      "body": "<p><strong> Felicity Collier</strong><br> Chief executive, British Agencies for Adoption </p> <p> There needs to be far better support in place for adoptive parents - and the children they adopt from local authority care who have more complex needs than the newborns adopted 30 years ago. The prevailing mythology is that politically correct social workers block wonderful, loving parents from adopting. In our experience, that is not the case. If parents want to adopt, they are putting themselves on the line and it is important that they get a fair hearing, but it is also important to remember that the children in the care system need protecting. </p> <p> Verdict: Yes</p> <p><strong> Christine Freeman</strong> <br>British parent who adopted from abroad </p> <p>My adopted son is from Mexico. I adopted him in Canada, rather than here, because there is a much more open policy on adoption there. Here, inter-country adoption is shaped by immigration policy. Reforms to the present system are a good thing: the reason why so many parents have to adopt abroad is because they have been excluded from adopting here because of the restrictive policies. The one restriction here I am in favour of is the one on adoptive parents who smoke because I think it is bad for a child to go into an environment where parents smoke. </p> <p> Verdict: Yes </p> <p><strong> Sean Galligan</strong> <br>Chair, Albert Kennedy Trust </p> <p>The government has made adoption too complicated and has ruled out far too many prospective adopters. These rules were originally established to make sure that the right kind of parents were chosen, but turning someone down because they are overweight or live in the wrong area is taking things to extremes and does not put the best interests of the child first. Sexuality should not be a factor which stops people from adopting. Saying gays and lesbians can adopt is saying they have the same legal rights as heterosexuals. It is a long, slow battle towards equality. </p> <p> Verdict: Yes</p> <p><strong> Monica Duck</strong><br> Director, Post-Adoption Centre </p> <p>I support the idea of improved adoption services. It is very important to ensure that all parties in the adoption have the sort of services that will meet the children's needs. One of the most important things for parents is to have a package of post-adoption support to help support the child through their formative years. Adoptive children are now older and more likely to have emotional problems. The most important thing is to recruit families that are child-centred and able to meet the complex needs of these children, rather than focusing on matters that are irrelevant.</p> <p> Verdict: Yes</p> <p><strong> Ann van Meeuwen</strong><br> Principal policy officer, Barnardo's </p> <p> We would like to see more children benefiting, but adoption these days is not straightforward because it is rarely of newborn babies. We would like to see the government provide post-adoption support and the money to pay for this support. If parents knew that adopting didn't mean just being left to get on with it and that financial and other forms of support were available, it might encourage more to come forward. The majority of parents who adopt are white, middle-class and childless; and more people from minority groups and single parents are needed.</p> <p> Verdict: Yes</p>",

      "bodyText": "Felicity Collier Chief executive, British Agencies for Adoption There needs to be far better support in place for adoptive parents - and the children they adopt from local authority care who have more complex needs than the newborns adopted 30 years ago. The prevailing mythology is that politically correct social workers block wonderful, loving parents from adopting. In our experience, that is not the case. If parents want to adopt, they are putting themselves on the line and it is important that they get a fair hearing, but it is also important to remember that the children in the care system need protecting. Verdict: Yes Christine Freeman British parent who adopted from abroad My adopted son is from Mexico. I adopted him in Canada, rather than here, because there is a much more open policy on adoption there. Here, inter-country adoption is shaped by immigration policy. Reforms to the present system are a good thing: the reason why so many parents have to adopt abroad is because they have been excluded from adopting here because of the restrictive policies. The one restriction here I am in favour of is the one on adoptive parents who smoke because I think it is bad for a child to go into an environment where parents smoke. Verdict: Yes Sean Galligan Chair, Albert Kennedy Trust The government has made adoption too complicated and has ruled out far too many prospective adopters. These rules were originally established to make sure that the right kind of parents were chosen, but turning someone down because they are overweight or live in the wrong area is taking things to extremes and does not put the best interests of the child first. Sexuality should not be a factor which stops people from adopting. Saying gays and lesbians can adopt is saying they have the same legal rights as heterosexuals. It is a long, slow battle towards equality. Verdict: Yes Monica Duck Director, Post-Adoption Centre I support the idea of improved adoption services. It is very important to ensure that all parties in the adoption have the sort of services that will meet the children's needs. One of the most important things for parents is to have a package of post-adoption support to help support the child through their formative years. Adoptive children are now older and more likely to have emotional problems. The most important thing is to recruit families that are child-centred and able to meet the complex needs of these children, rather than focusing on matters that are irrelevant. Verdict: Yes Ann van Meeuwen Principal policy officer, Barnardo's We would like to see more children benefiting, but adoption these days is not straightforward because it is rarely of newborn babies. We would like to see the government provide post-adoption support and the money to pay for this support. If parents knew that adopting didn't mean just being left to get on with it and that financial and other forms of support were available, it might encourage more to come forward. The majority of parents who adopt are white, middle-class and childless; and more people from minority groups and single parents are needed. Verdict: Yes",

      "body": "<p>Have you managed to buy a Bob the Builder figure yet? Manufacturers may have plastered ads all over comics, billboards, TV, films and the internet, but I can't find one local shop with any member of the construction team for my son. </p> <p>It is testament to the power of marketing that the demand for a particular toy can be so inflamed that its popularity burns out the country's supply. And, as with the infamous Buzz Lightyear sell-out of Christmas 1997, the more rare and unobtainable a toy becomes, the more rampant the children's desire for the toys they have set their hearts on will be. </p> <p>At Christmas, marketing campaign temperatures, for these toys for younger children and for fashion or lifestyle accessories aimed at older children, soar off the thermometer. It is not hard to understand why. Many toy stores, such as Hamleys, make approximately 50% of their annual profit in December. Britain's toy market is worth about \u00a31.66bn a year, while designer clothes and CDs aimed at kids are also multi-million-pound industries. Ultimately, parents are the target for this commercial blitz and it can be difficult to know how to handle it, particularly if money is tight. </p> <p>Jan Thompson, a 34-year-old single mother in Willesden, north London, explains how marketing affects her and her 13-year-old daughter Gill: \"When we see ads for Nike or Reebok trainers, it's very hard to explain that we can't afford them while half of Gill's classmates wear them. It makes her feel as if she isn't as good her friends.\" </p> <p>Besides being strapped for cash, there are other reasons for people resisting commercialism. Elizabeth Peck, 37, a writer and her TV producer husband Mike, 45, live in Bristol, They try to control carefully what their children Amelia, four, and Joe, two, watch and read. </p> <p>\"I allow them to watch only Teletubbies and Tweenies,\" Elizabeth says. \"We keep a close eye on what they see and would never let Amelia on the internet on her own. I don't want their play and toys to be determined by adverts. We want them to find their own way of playing.\" </p> <p>Keeping control while you are bombarded by hard-sell messages can, however, be difficult. The Llewellyns, in Wimbledon, prefer to concentrate their efforts on defusing \"pester power\" rather than shielding their sons Thomas, eight, and Hector, six, from commercial pressures. </p> <p>\"TV ads don't seem to have a significant effect,\" says 36-year-old mother Philippa Llewellyn. \"Even though Hector may be influenced by them, it is for only a short time. Thomas seems more influenced by peer pressure than adverts. Older children at school seem to give him the idea that Pokemon or Gameboy is the must-have toy.\" </p> <p>The peer-pressure phenomenon is well observed. \"It is from upper primary school and above that children get into wearing the same gear and get prone to peer pressure,\" comments educational psychologist Jenni Smith, \"but for younger children marketing pressures tend to go over their heads.\" </p> <p>Not all advertisers agree: earlier this year, the Co-op announced its decision to stop promoting high-sugar, high-fat, \"unhealthy\" foods during children's viewing times; and the Tesco supermarket chain operates a similar voluntary code. In Sweden, a ban on television advertising aimed at children under 12 has been in effect for the past decade, and there have been moves in Ireland this year to follow suit. </p> <p>But television is not the only battle-ground. The Internet is a rapidly-growing forum for child-oriented marketing, with sites ranging from <a href=\"http://www.pokemon.com\" target=\"_NEW\">pokemon.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.barbie.com\" target=\"_NEW\">barbie.com</a> to <a href=\"http://www.lego.com\" target=\"_NEW\">lego.com</a>. Richard Marshall is a director of Tullo Marshall Warren, a leading direct marketing agency that is increasingly targeting web users. He argues that these types of sites \"provide a safe environment for children to play online\". </p> <p>\"Today's children are highly computer-literate,\" he continues, \"and if the internet empowers them to influence what they want for Christmas, so be it - even if it is a bit more clinical than the letter to Santa.\" </p> <p>So just how ethical is it for businesses to use advertising to pitch to children - people whom in most other spheres (voting, sex and legal documents, for example) are treated as being incapable of making important decisions? Mike Jempson, director of media ethics charity Presswise, is in no doubt. \"These ads are pernicious,\" he argues. \"Their message is, 'If you haven't got this product, you are abnormal.' And the poor are most vulnerable to this because they already feel excluded by society. The aim of most marketing is to sell goods, but ads aimed at children are designed to get kids to pressurise their peers and parents. This is divisive, no matter how wealthy the family.\" </p> <p>According to Jempson, advertising reinforces social exclusion by holding up a constant taunt to those who cannot afford to buy into the fantasy world it creates. In November, chancellor Gordon Brown made a public attack on child-targeted adverts, while Sweden is trying to get the European Union to follow its lead in banning this type of marketing. </p> <p>But to Amy Lawson, stepmother of two boys and managing director of ad agency Wieden and Kennedy, whose clients include Nike, Virgin Interactive and Diet Coke, such action would be an extreme restriction on personal liberty. \"We live in a free society where consumers have rights to choose, and ads enable children to make comparisons,\" says Lawson. \"If we prevent a whole section of the population from seeing something, what will we censor next? At some point, children have to learn how to choose, and if they don't have experience of this as they are growing up, they won't be able to handle it later. </p> <p>\"Parents need to teach them to manage expectations,\" Lawson concludes. \"So if they can't have a product now, they understand about waiting.\" </p> <p>For the time being, at least, child-targeted advertising is simply a reality that parents have to face - by being realistic. In Jenni Smith's view, we should get away from the feeling that we will damage a child by refusing them something they have fallen in love with on the TV. \"It is more important to lay down boundaries for children about what they can and can't have, rather than what they can and can't watch,\" she says. \"If parents can explain why something has been refused, this helps children understand how to make their own choices.\" </p> <p>So, stick to your boundaries. But before you do, if you find a store that has a Bob The Builder, please let me know.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Lima, Peru</strong><br> <strong>October, 1997</strong></p> <p> The naked parrot looked like a human fetus spliced onto a kosher chicken. It was so old it had lost every single one of its feathers, even its pinfeathers, and its bumpy, jaundiced skin was latticed by a network of rubbery blue veins. </p> <p>\"Pathological,\" muttered Switters, meaning not simply the parrot but the whole scene, including the shrunken old woman in whose footsteps the bird doggedly followed as she moved about the darkened villa. The parrot's scabrous claws made a dry, scraping noise as they fought for purchase on the terra-cotta floor tiles, and when, periodically, the creature lost its footing and skidded an inch or two, it issued a squawk so quavery and feeble that it sounded as if it were being clucked, whether in sympathy or disapproval one could not tell, for she never turned to her devoted little companion but wandered aimlessly from one piece of ancient wooden furniture to another in her amorphous black dress. </p> <p>Switters feigned appreciation, but he was secretly repulsed, all the more so because Juan Carlos, who stood beside him on the patio, also spying in the widow's windows, was beaming with pride and satisfaction. Switters slapped at the mosquitoes that perforated his torso and cursed every hair on that hand of Fate that had snatched him into South too-goddamned vivid America. </p> <p><strong>Boquichicos, Peru</strong><br> <strong>November 1997 </strong></p> <p>Attracted by the lamplight that seeped through the louvers, a mammoth moth beat against the shutters like a storm. Switters watched it with some fascination as he waited for the boys to bring his luggage up from the river. That moth was no butterfly that was certain, It was a night animal, and it had a night animal's mystery.</p> <p>Butterflies were delicate and gossamer, but this moth possessed strength and weight. Its heavy wings were powdered like the face of an old actress. Butterflies were presumed to be carefree, moths were slaves to a fiery obsession. Butterflies seemed innocuous, moths somehow ... erotic. The dust of the moth was sexual dust. The twitch of the moth was a sexual twitch. Suddenly Switters touched his throat and moaned. He moaned because it occurred to him how much the more resembled a clitoris with wings. </p> <p>Vivid. </p> <p>There were grunts on the path behind him, and Inti emerged from the forest bearing, somewhat apprehensively, Switter's crocodile-skin valise. In a moment the other two boys appeared with the rest of his gear. It was time to review accommodations in the Hotel Boquichicos. He dreaded what he might find behind its shuttered windows, its double-screened doors, but he motioned for the boys to follow him in. \"Let's go. This insect -\" He nodded at the great moth that, fan though it might, was unable to stir the steaming green broth that in the Amazon often substitutes for air. \"This insect is making me feel -\" Switters hestitated to use the word, even though he knew Inti could understand no more than a dozen simple syllables of English. \"This insect is making me feel libidinous.\" </p> <p><strong>Central Syria</strong><br> <strong>May 1998 </strong></p> <p>Trekking towards al Qaz-as in a late spring rain, the nomads were soaked and nearly giddy. Behind them, at lower elevations, the grass was already yellowing and withering, fodder not for flocks but for wildfires; ahead, the mountain passes conceivably could still be obstructed by snow. Whatever anxieties the band maintained, however, were washed away by the downpour. In country such as this, hope's other name was moisture. </p> <p>Even the sheep and goats seemed merry, lighter of hoof, although individual beasts paused from time to time to shake rainwater from their coats, vigorously, stiffly, causing them to look like self-conscious burlesque queens. Their leathery black muzzles, glistening with rain, were pointed - not so much by their drivers as by a migratory instinct older than humanity - towards distant pastures. </p> <p>Switters was one of four men - the Khan, the Khan's eldest son, an experienced pathfinder, and himself who travelled on horseback, at the head of the procession. The rest were on foot. They had been on the move, dawn to dusk, for almost a week. </p> <p>About two miles back, prior to beginning their gradual ascent, they had passed a large compound, an oasis, undoubtedly, completely surrounded by a high mud wall. The boughs of orchard trees rose above the wall, and the scent of orange blossoms boosted to a higher power the already intoxicating small of the rain. From inside the compound, Switters thought he heard the wild sugary shriek of girlish laughter. Several of the young men must have heard it, too, for they turned their heads to stare wistfully at the remote estate. </p> <p>The band pressed on. That is what nomads do. Forward the march. The burden and the bleating. </p> <p>Switters, however, could not get the mini-oasis out of his mind. Something about it - is mysterious walls, its lush vegetation, its auditory hint of young women splashing in the rain - had gripped his imagination with such steady pressure that eventually he announced to his hosts his intention to return and investigate the place. One might say they were shocked, except that his very presence among them was in and of itself so extraordinary that they were partially immune to further bewilderment. </p> <p>The khan shook his head and his eldest son, who spoke passable English, objected, \"Oh Sir, we must not turn back. The flocks-\" </p> <p>Switters who spoke passable Arabic, interrupted to explain that he meant to go alone. </p> <p>\"But Sir,\" sad the eldest son, wringing his hands and screwing up his forehead until it looked like the rolled-back lid of a sardine can, \"the horse. We have only these four, you see, and we - \" </p> <p>\"No, no, good buddy. Assure your papa I had no notion of galloping off with his fine nag. Now, he can let his next eldest son hop up and take a load off his tootsies.\" </p> <p>\"But, sir\" </p> <p>\"I'll just zip on back there in my starship. If you boys'll be so good as to ready it for me.\" </p> <p>The khan waved the procession to a halt. At that exact moment the rain stopped as well. Two of the tribesman unfastened Switter's chair from behind the saddle, unfolded it, placed it on a reasonably level patch, and set its brake. Then they helped him off the horse and lifted him gently into the seat. They strapped his croc-skin valise to the chair back and laid his computer, satellite telephone, and customized Beretta 9-mm revolver, each wrapped in a separate plastic garbage bag, on his lap. </p> <p>Elaborate farewells were exchanged, after which the nomads watched for many minutes in nothing short of awe as Switters, laboriously, precariously - but singing all the while - manoeuvred the rickety, hand-operated wheelchair over the brutal rocks and ensnaring sands of a landscape so harsh in its promise that a mere glimpse of it would propel a Romantic poet to therapy or a developer to gin. </p> <p>Slowly he dissolved into the wilderness. </p> <p>He seemed to be singing \"Send in the Clowns.\" </p> <p><strong>Vatican City</strong><br> <strong>May 1999 </strong></p> <p>The Cardinal ordered Switters and his party to queue up single file. The garden path was narrow, he explained, and besides, it would be unseemly to approach His Holiness all in a bunch. Switters was to go first. If his weapon had not been confiscated at the last security check-point, he might have insisted on bringing up the rear, but now it didn't matter. </p> <p>Because of his \"disability\", Switters needn't feel obliged to kneel upon reaching the throne, the cardinal had generously conceded. Switters wondered if, nevertheless, he would be expected to kiss the pope's ring. Only way I'm smooching that ring, he thought, is if they paste a crumb of hashish on it, or else smear it with pussy juice or red-eye gravy. </p> <p>As he thought that, he was remembering an actress he used to know, who, in order to entice a tiny trained terrier to follow her around during a movie scene, had had to have scraps of raw calf's liver stapled to the soles of her high-heeled shoes. </p> <p>Thinking of that terrier magnitized by meat-baited slippers reminded him then of the old bald parrot that had waddled after its mistress in a Lima suburb many months before - and for a moment Switters was back in Peru. That's the way the mind works. </p> <p>That's the way the mind works: the human brain is genetically disposed towards organisation, yet if not tightly controlled, will link one imagerial fragment to another on the flimsiest of pretence and in the most freewheeling manner, as if it takes a kind of organic pleasure in creative association, without regard for logic, or chronological sequence. </p> <p>Now, it appears that this prose account has unintentionally begun in partial mimicry of the mind. Four scenes have occurred at four different locations at four separate times, some set apart by months or years. And while they do maintain chronological order and a connective element (Switters), and while the motif is a far cry from the kind of stream-of-consciousness that makes Finnegans Wake simultaneously the most realistic and the most unreadable book ever written (unreadable precisely because it is so realistic), still, alas, the preceding is probably not the way in which an effective narrative ought properly to unfold - not even in these days when the world is showing signs of awakening from its linear trance, its dangerously restrictive sense of itself as a historical vehicle chugging down a one-way street toward some preordained apocalyptic goal. </p> <p>Henceforth, this account shall gather itself at an acceptable starting point (every beginning in narration is somewhat arbitrary and the one that follows is no exception), from which it shall then move forward in a so-called timely fashion, shunning the wantonly tangential influence of the natural mind and stopping only occasionally to smell the adjectives of kick some ass. </p> <p>Since this new approach should render chapter headings (those that designate date and place) unnecessary, they will from now on be scratched. If the next chapter were to have a heading, however it would read: </p> <p><strong>Seattle </strong><br> <strong>October 1997 </strong></p> <p>It was on a mist-bearded Saturday morning, grey as a ghoul and cool as clam aspic, that Switters showed up at his grandmother's house. En route from the airport, he had stopped by Pike Place Market, where he bought a bouquet of golden chrysanthemums, as well as a medium-sized pumpkin. Now he was forced to juggle these items in order to free a hand with which to turn up his trench coat collar against the microdontic nipping of the drizzle. He had also purchased a capsule of XTC from a hipster fish merchant he knew, and as he walked from the rental car to the stately mansion, he managed to get it to his mouth and swallow it without the benefit of liquid. It tasted like snapper. </p> <p>He punched the bell. After a brief interval, his grandmother's voice crackled out of the speaker. \"Who is it? What do you want? This had better be good.\" The woman refused to keep a downstairs maid, although she was eighty-three years old and had the wherewithal. </p> <p>\"It's me. Switters.\" </p> <p>\"Who?\" </p> <p>\"Switters. Your favourite relation. Buzz me in, Maestra.\" </p> <p>\"Heh! 'Favourite relation' in your dreams, maybe. Do you come bearing gifts?\" </p> <p>\"Absolutely\" </p> <p>He heard the electronic loosening of the latch. \"I'm advancing. Brace yourself, Maestra.\" </p> <p>\"Heh!\" </p> <p>When Switters was less than a year old, his grandmother had stood before his highchair, her hands on her still glamorous hips. \"You're starting to jabber like a damn disk jockey,' she said. \"Pretty soon you'll be having a name for me, so I want to make this clear: you are not to insult me with one of those declasse G words, like granny or grams or gramma or whatever, you understand; and if you ever call me nannie or nonna - or moomaw or big mamma or mawmaw I'll bust your cute little chops. I'm aware that it's innate in the human infant to produce M sounds followed by soft vowels in response to materialistic stimuli, so if you find it primally necessary to label me with something of that ilk, then let it be 'maestra' or 'teacher'. I don't know if I'll ever teach you anything worthwhile, and I sure as hell don't want to be anybody's master, but at least maestra has got some dignity. Try saying it.\" </p> <p>Little more than a year later, when he was two, the child had marched up to his Grandmother, pinned her with his already fierce, hypnotic green eyes, planted his hands on his hips, and commanded \"Call me Switters.\" Maestra had studied him for a while, had puzzled over his sudden identification with his non too illustrious surname, and finally nodded. \"Very well,\" she said. \"Fair enough.\" </p> <p>His mother continued to call him Baby Dumpling. But not for long. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters/story/0,6761,413892,00.html\">Continue</a></p>",

Switters was one of four men - the Khan, the Khan's eldest son, an experienced pathfinder, and himself who travelled on horseback, at the head of the procession. The rest were on foot. They had been on the move, dawn to dusk, for almost a week. About two miles back, prior to beginning their gradual ascent, they had passed a large compound, an oasis, undoubtedly, completely surrounded by a high mud wall. The boughs of orchard trees rose above the wall, and the scent of orange blossoms boosted to a higher power the already intoxicating small of the rain. From inside the compound, Switters thought he heard the wild sugary shriek of girlish laughter. Several of the young men must have heard it, too, for they turned their heads to stare wistfully at the remote estate. The band pressed on. That is what nomads do. Forward the march. The burden and the bleating. Switters, however, could not get the mini-oasis out of his mind. Something about it - is mysterious walls, its lush vegetation, its auditory hint of young women splashing in the rain - had gripped his imagination with such steady pressure that eventually he announced to his hosts his intention to return and investigate the place. One might say they were shocked, except that his very presence among them was in and of itself so extraordinary that they were partially immune to further bewilderment. The khan shook his head and his eldest son, who spoke passable English, objected, \"Oh Sir, we must not turn back. The flocks-\" Switters who spoke passable Arabic, interrupted to explain that he meant to go alone. \"But Sir,\" sad the eldest son, wringing his hands and screwing up his forehead until it looked like the rolled-back lid of a sardine can, \"the horse. We have only these four, you see, and we - \" \"No, no, good buddy. Assure your papa I had no notion of galloping off with his fine nag. Now, he can let his next eldest son hop up and take a load off his tootsies.\" \"But, sir\" \"I'll just zip on back there in my starship. If you boys'll be so good as to ready it for me.\" The khan waved the procession to a halt. At that exact moment the rain stopped as well. Two of the tribesman unfastened Switter's chair from behind the saddle, unfolded it, placed it on a reasonably level patch, and set its brake. Then they helped him off the horse and lifted him gently into the seat. They strapped his croc-skin valise to the chair back and laid his computer, satellite telephone, and customized Beretta 9-mm revolver, each wrapped in a separate plastic garbage bag, on his lap. Elaborate farewells were exchanged, after which the nomads watched for many minutes in nothing short of awe as Switters, laboriously, precariously - but singing all the while - manoeuvred the rickety, hand-operated wheelchair over the brutal rocks and ensnaring sands of a landscape so harsh in its promise that a mere glimpse of it would propel a Romantic poet to therapy or a developer to gin. Slowly he dissolved into the wilderness. He seemed to be singing \"Send in the Clowns.\" Vatican City May 1999 The Cardinal ordered Switters and his party to queue up single file. The garden path was narrow, he explained, and besides, it would be unseemly to approach His Holiness all in a bunch. Switters was to go first. If his weapon had not been confiscated at the last security check-point, he might have insisted on bringing up the rear, but now it didn't matter. Because of his \"disability\", Switters needn't feel obliged to kneel upon reaching the throne, the cardinal had generously conceded. Switters wondered if, nevertheless, he would be expected to kiss the pope's ring. Only way I'm smooching that ring, he thought, is if they paste a crumb of hashish on it, or else smear it with pussy juice or red-eye gravy. As he thought that, he was remembering an actress he used to know, who, in order to entice a tiny trained terrier to follow her around during a movie scene, had had to have scraps of raw calf's liver stapled to the soles of her high-heeled shoes. Thinking of that terrier magnitized by meat-baited slippers reminded him then of the old bald parrot that had waddled after its mistress in a Lima suburb many months before - and for a moment Switters was back in Peru. That's the way the mind works. That's the way the mind works: the human brain is genetically disposed towards organisation, yet if not tightly controlled, will link one imagerial fragment to another on the flimsiest of pretence and in the most freewheeling manner, as if it takes a kind of organic pleasure in creative association, without regard for logic, or chronological sequence. Now, it appears that this prose account has unintentionally begun in partial mimicry of the mind. Four scenes have occurred at four different locations at four separate times, some set apart by months or years. And while they do maintain chronological order and a connective element (Switters), and while the motif is a far cry from the kind of stream-of-consciousness that makes Finnegans Wake simultaneously the most realistic and the most unreadable book ever written (unreadable precisely because it is so realistic), still, alas, the preceding is probably not the way in which an effective narrative ought properly to unfold - not even in these days when the world is showing signs of awakening from its linear trance, its dangerously restrictive sense of itself as a historical vehicle chugging down a one-way street toward some preordained apocalyptic goal. Henceforth, this account shall gather itself at an acceptable starting point (every beginning in narration is somewhat arbitrary and the one that follows is no exception), from which it shall then move forward in a so-called timely fashion, shunning the wantonly tangential influence of the natural mind and stopping only occasionally to smell the adjectives of kick some ass. Since this new approach should render chapter headings (those that designate date and place) unnecessary, they will from now on be scratched. If the next chapter were to have a heading, however it would read: Seattle October 1997 It was on a mist-bearded Saturday morning, grey as a ghoul and cool as clam aspic, that Switters showed up at his grandmother's house. En route from the airport, he had stopped by Pike Place Market, where he bought a bouquet of golden chrysanthemums, as well as a medium-sized pumpkin. Now he was forced to juggle these items in order to free a hand with which to turn up his trench coat collar against the microdontic nipping of the drizzle. He had also purchased a capsule of XTC from a hipster fish merchant he knew, and as he walked from the rental car to the stately mansion, he managed to get it to his mouth and swallow it without the benefit of liquid. It tasted like snapper. He punched the bell. After a brief interval, his grandmother's voice crackled out of the speaker. \"Who is it? What do you want? This had better be good.\" The woman refused to keep a downstairs maid, although she was eighty-three years old and had the wherewithal. \"It's me. Switters.\" \"Who?\" \"Switters. Your favourite relation. Buzz me in, Maestra.\" \"Heh! 'Favourite relation' in your dreams, maybe. Do you come bearing gifts?\" \"Absolutely\" He heard the electronic loosening of the latch. \"I'm advancing. Brace yourself, Maestra.\" \"Heh!\" When Switters was less than a year old, his grandmother had stood before his highchair, her hands on her still glamorous hips. \"You're starting to jabber like a damn disk jockey,' she said. \"Pretty soon you'll be having a name for me, so I want to make this clear: you are not to insult me with one of those declasse G words, like granny or grams or gramma or whatever, you understand; and if you ever call me nannie or nonna - or moomaw or big mamma or mawmaw I'll bust your cute little chops. I'm aware that it's innate in the human infant to produce M sounds followed by soft vowels in response to materialistic stimuli, so if you find it primally necessary to label me with something of that ilk, then let it be 'maestra' or 'teacher'. I don't know if I'll ever teach you anything worthwhile, and I sure as hell don't want to be anybody's master, but at least maestra has got some dignity. Try saying it.\" Little more than a year later, when he was two, the child had marched up to his Grandmother, pinned her with his already fierce, hypnotic green eyes, planted his hands on his hips, and commanded \"Call me Switters.\" Maestra had studied him for a while, had puzzled over his sudden identification with his non too illustrious surname, and finally nodded. \"Very well,\" she said. \"Fair enough.\" His mother continued to call him Baby Dumpling. But not for long. Continue",

Right in the middle of it, and not wearing his family tartan, was our very own Mr Ritchie asking me to dance.

It's just the media that are being so silly.\" The most burning issue in her mind at the moment is Christmas Day, where she will have to balance the midnight service a morning family carol service and cook dinner for 14.</p> <p>While Susan takes care of the spiritual side of the community, the local solicitor John Gunn, who also functions as a notary, vice-chairman of the local school and treasurer of the local Imperial Cancer Research Fund, reminds me of how local people work as part of a tradition that spans centuries. \"We have a fragile working rural community,\" he says. \"Farming is getting harder all the time, and tourism is really a main source of economy, so this is a great opportunity for us to get on the map. Essentially, it's great publicity.\"</p> <p>About 10 minutes away from Dornoch is Skibo Castle, where the Madonna wedding party is staying. It has had a long tradition of high society revelry since the late 19th century. Scottish-born Andrew Carnegie,who made millions from steel in Pittsburgh and became one of the richest men in the world, missed his homeland and bought Skibo Castle so he could bring people as varied as Helen Keller, the Rockefellers, Rudyard Kipling and Edward VII together. Edward even granted the property permission to fly a double sided flag that shows the Union Jack on one side and the stars and stripes on the other.</p> <p>Yet only a stone's throw from the grandeur of the castle gates lives Margaret Thomson, Carnegie's great-grand daughter and also one of the first women of her generation to run a farm. Over lunch, she admits not to be that worried about the arrival of one of the world's greatest pop icons - at the moment she is more concerned with tagging her sheep according to the new EU regulations. \"I think it's brilliant Madonna has come up here,\" she says, throwing another Labrador off her lap, \"and I think it will bring the area a lot of attention. But I have to admit half the time up here I'm not sure what planet I'm on except the farm.\"</p> <p>As we drive home past the Skibo Gates where photographers are shivering in the cold, I wonder if the press really have any clue about the world they are currently occupying. Of course, they are not here for that, and if they were, it would be easy to paint a charmingly quaint picture of life up here, full of sheep, and funny crofting characters whose family have been in the area for generations (and we do have them).</p> <p>But this is not the point. The point is that up here we are far removed from the madness of London life, and maybe, despite the ratpack, that is why Madonna is here too.</p>",

It's just the media that are being so silly.\" The most burning issue in her mind at the moment is Christmas Day, where she will have to balance the midnight service a morning family carol service and cook dinner for 14. While Susan takes care of the spiritual side of the community, the local solicitor John Gunn, who also functions as a notary, vice-chairman of the local school and treasurer of the local Imperial Cancer Research Fund, reminds me of how local people work as part of a tradition that spans centuries. \"We have a fragile working rural community,\" he says. \"Farming is getting harder all the time, and tourism is really a main source of economy, so this is a great opportunity for us to get on the map. Essentially, it's great publicity.\" About 10 minutes away from Dornoch is Skibo Castle, where the Madonna wedding party is staying. It has had a long tradition of high society revelry since the late 19th century. Scottish-born Andrew Carnegie,who made millions from steel in Pittsburgh and became one of the richest men in the world, missed his homeland and bought Skibo Castle so he could bring people as varied as Helen Keller, the Rockefellers, Rudyard Kipling and Edward VII together. Edward even granted the property permission to fly a double sided flag that shows the Union Jack on one side and the stars and stripes on the other. Yet only a stone's throw from the grandeur of the castle gates lives Margaret Thomson, Carnegie's great-grand daughter and also one of the first women of her generation to run a farm. Over lunch, she admits not to be that worried about the arrival of one of the world's greatest pop icons - at the moment she is more concerned with tagging her sheep according to the new EU regulations. \"I think it's brilliant Madonna has come up here,\" she says, throwing another Labrador off her lap, \"and I think it will bring the area a lot of attention. But I have to admit half the time up here I'm not sure what planet I'm on except the farm.\" As we drive home past the Skibo Gates where photographers are shivering in the cold, I wonder if the press really have any clue about the world they are currently occupying. Of course, they are not here for that, and if they were, it would be easy to paint a charmingly quaint picture of life up here, full of sheep, and funny crofting characters whose family have been in the area for generations (and we do have them). But this is not the point. The point is that up here we are far removed from the madness of London life, and maybe, despite the ratpack, that is why Madonna is here too.",

It also means, for the homeless, shopping carts.</p> <p>The shopping cart or trolley is the preferred method by which homeless people can transport their belongings as they move from patch to patch, and in them they can store their clothes, blankets, sleeping bags, newspapers and all the necessities of life on the street.</p> <p>Traditionally, they have helped themselves to these vehicles from outside the wealthy supermarkets of the city but the disappearance of shopping trolleys is one of those urban problems to which an extraordinary amount of time is dedicated. This week it was announced that the 'uncart' had been developed, a trolley that, when wheeled outside a supermarket's parking lot, will seize up and go no further, its little wheels locking up.</p> <p>In the meantime, police have been arresting people for having stolen shopping Trolleys, so in a bid to save homeless people from going to court, local charities are buying trolleys and giving them free to the homeless.</p> <p>But the 'uncart' is not the only imaginative development in the transport policies of the city. Science fiction writer Ray Bradbury, author of the classic Fahrenheit 451, was invited by LA's Metropolitan Transport Authority to address them on what the future should hold for them. Bradbury is 80 now and he gave them what for.</p> <p>Looking at the MTA headquarters, a spiffy building that cost $500 million to build, he told his hosts: \"it's ridiculous, this building. You could build a transit system for the cost of putting this place up.\" He suggested that the board could just as easily hold their meetings in a nearby cafe, Clifton's Cafeteria.</p> <p>Bradbury said that he had suggested a monorail for the city 40 years ago but had been given short shrift. Now he was still recommending it as a way to escape the gridlocked freeways and the minimal subway system.</p> <p>It would have to be an improvement on the current system, which is used by only 5 per cent of commuters. The current chaos on the roads goes back to dark days half a century ago when an unholy alliance of automobile, oil and tyre interests, including Firestone, General Motors and Standard Oil, bought up land in order to kill off public transport and allow their own interests to flourish.</p> <p>The perpetrators of this scheme were punished under the anti-trust laws in 1949 with a laughable fine of $37,000, by which time the damage had been done (the scheme provided part of the plot for the film, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?).</p> <p>Now we have come full circle and transport is once again provoking anger and invention in equal measure.

This means the proliferation of the suburban tank, otherwise known as the sport utility vehicle, ordinary cars, motorbikes, bicycles and now, of course, scooters which surely must be about to go the way of the yo-yo and CB radio. It also means, for the homeless, shopping carts. The shopping cart or trolley is the preferred method by which homeless people can transport their belongings as they move from patch to patch, and in them they can store their clothes, blankets, sleeping bags, newspapers and all the necessities of life on the street. Traditionally, they have helped themselves to these vehicles from outside the wealthy supermarkets of the city but the disappearance of shopping trolleys is one of those urban problems to which an extraordinary amount of time is dedicated. This week it was announced that the 'uncart' had been developed, a trolley that, when wheeled outside a supermarket's parking lot, will seize up and go no further, its little wheels locking up. In the meantime, police have been arresting people for having stolen shopping Trolleys, so in a bid to save homeless people from going to court, local charities are buying trolleys and giving them free to the homeless. But the 'uncart' is not the only imaginative development in the transport policies of the city. Science fiction writer Ray Bradbury, author of the classic Fahrenheit 451, was invited by LA's Metropolitan Transport Authority to address them on what the future should hold for them. Bradbury is 80 now and he gave them what for. Looking at the MTA headquarters, a spiffy building that cost $500 million to build, he told his hosts: \"it's ridiculous, this building. You could build a transit system for the cost of putting this place up.\" He suggested that the board could just as easily hold their meetings in a nearby cafe, Clifton's Cafeteria. Bradbury said that he had suggested a monorail for the city 40 years ago but had been given short shrift. Now he was still recommending it as a way to escape the gridlocked freeways and the minimal subway system. It would have to be an improvement on the current system, which is used by only 5 per cent of commuters. The current chaos on the roads goes back to dark days half a century ago when an unholy alliance of automobile, oil and tyre interests, including Firestone, General Motors and Standard Oil, bought up land in order to kill off public transport and allow their own interests to flourish. The perpetrators of this scheme were punished under the anti-trust laws in 1949 with a laughable fine of $37,000, by which time the damage had been done (the scheme provided part of the plot for the film, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?). Now we have come full circle and transport is once again provoking anger and invention in equal measure. Wheels on fire indeed.

Statistics from the International Data Corporation show a fall in Toshiba's share of China's laptop market from 19.4% to 15.4% in the second quarter of the year. A Toshiba spokesperson admitted that hostile Chinese media reports may have been a factor. Toshiba came under heavy fire not only from computer experts but from Chinese nationalists after it was reported that compensation paid by the corporation in the US for an alleged defect would not be available to Chinese purchasers. Toshiba explained in vain that the compensation had only been paid because it risked facing a high punitive award in the state of Texas not because it admitted liability for the alleged defect. It also claimed that laptops sold in China did not have the same potential problem in the floppy disk controller. A barrage of hostile comments was quickly posted on Chinese website discussion groups. In September a Chinese hacker organisation calling itself the \"Bayonet Group\" successfully attacked the homepage of Toshiba (China). Several hundred approving messages appeared in the space of two days on sina.com, one of China's most prominent sites. \"I express the greatest respect towards this hacker and actions,\" declared a typical message. \"The Japanese cruelly massacred the Chinese, looted the wealth of China, and never stopped from the time of the Japanese pirates of the 14th century to now!\" Japan's wartime atrocities have left a strong undercurrent of popular hostility which Beijing sometimes encourages but at other times tries to keep under control.

China maintains that the death toll was as high as 300,000. On December 13, the anniversary of the massacre, several thousand local people smashed windows at a new restaurant which had been erected on the site of a commemorative monument. The memorial stone had been shifted, apparently by the builders, and lay broken a short distance away. The popular anger was intensified because the restaurant had only opened on the previous day at a ceremony attended by top government leaders. About 2,000 angry residents maintained a vigil outside the restaurant complex over the weekend, demanding to know why the monument had been moved. Some Chinese have expressed concern at the ease with which nationalistic hostility is aroused by cases such as that of Toshiba. Such cases, a commentator wrote in the Beijing Youth Daily, \"do not harm the national pride of the Chinese nation at all, because true national pride is based on national strength, economic prosperity and cultural development instead of smiles on foreigners' faces\". \"If we believe that civilisation will conquer ignorance,\" wrote another contributor criticising the hackers, \"we must start from ourselves and first learn to be civilised.\" But majority public opinion is incensed by recurring attempts by Japanese rightwing historians to minimise the extent of the Nanjing massacre, and by a succession of real or fancied insults today.

      "bodyText": "China has singled out population growth as the key factor restricting its future economic and social development. It says it represents the country's number one challenge this century. A white paper on population control coincides with the publication yesterday of a 12-point list of government priorities in which population pressure comes top and reunification with Taiwan does not even get a mention. The white paper admits that China has \"a huge population but a weak economic foundation\" and that although over 300m births \"have been averted\" in the past 20 years by population controls, a net rise of at least 10m people a year for the next decade is forecast - a figure many experts believe will prove to be an underestimate. The 12 \"challenges for the new century\" were published in the Communist party's organ, the People's Daily, yesterday. Top of the list was \"population pressure which will rise to an estimated 1.6bn [from the current 1.3bn] by the 2030s\", the newspaper said. The next priorities were: economic competition with the developed world; China's deteriorating environment; the need to develop more rational economic structures; and the need to reduce the gap between China's rich and poor. The fight against \"world hegemonism and power politics\" comes in at the bottom of the list. But the population paper also strikes a realistic footnote, detailing a formidable range of social and economic problems which the Chinese government has barely begun to tackle. It states that the sharp rise in the adult labour force has placed great pressure on the job market, that the social security system cannot cope with the number of people living longer, and that the gap between rich and poor provinces is hard to eradicate. The white paper also warns that the increase in China's \"floating population\" of migrant workers from the countryside - estimated unofficially at 150m to 200m - will make it harder to keep the birth rate down. There is an enlightened willingness to acknowledge the seamy side of modern Chinese society and the continuing discrimination against female births, warning that \"any action of maltreating, drowning and discarding girls is forbidden, and such crimes as mistreatment and trafficking of children should be severely punished\". Help for female children, disabled girls, children in single parent families and in poverty, and street children should also receive government attention. International aid groups in Beijing say that over the past two to three years, their counterparts in Chinese ministries have become much more willing to discuss such problems frankly. But they warn that obstruction at the local level, either through incompetent or corrupt officials, is still a serious problem. In a candid assessment of China's current social strains , the white paper focuses on the need to improve health provision, particularly in the countryside so that farming families can ensure that their children will survive. It also calls for \"strenuous efforts\" to check the spread of Aids and other sexually transmitted diseases. The importance of education was also acknowledged as a vital ingredient. \"The rate of illiteracy should be further reduced\", the paper says. \"The right to education of minors, women, ethnic minorities, the handicapped and poverty-stricken people should be protected.\"",

      "bodyText": "Indonesia's President Abdurrahman Wahid is to visit troubled Irian Jaya province in a bid to quell violent separatism, officials said today. Details of the trip were released a day after President Wahid made a brief visit to Aceh, the predominantly Muslim province in north-west Sumatra that is also the scene of a bloody independence struggle. When he visits Irian Jaya on December 25, Wahid hopes to meet with community and religious leaders and take part in Christmas celebrations, presidential palace official Pria Sambadha said. Unlike much of Indonesia, where 90% of people are Muslim, Irian Jaya is home to many Christians Rebels in the province, located on the western half of New Guinea island and also known as West Papua, have been fighting for independence since Indonesia took control of the former Dutch colony in 1963. There has been an upsurge in violence recently, with at least 19 people killed in clashes this month. Police arrested five separatist leaders ahead of a December 1 ceremony to mark the 39th anniversary of a failed, unilateral declaration of independence from Dutch rule. Irian Jaya community leader Sofyan Wandgai met with President Wahid in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta today and said the president repeated demands that the five be released. President Wahid's earlier requests have been ignored by security officers and hardline members of his government. The five men, including head of the Papua Presidium Council Theys Eluay, have been accused of subversion and face up 20 years in prison if convicted. Yesterday, President Wahid visited Aceh and admitted that he had made mistakes in handling the separatist crisis that has claimed at least 432 lives since a ceasefire came into effect between Aceh rebels and government forces in June. In a nationally televised speech, he said peace negotiations with the rebel Free Aceh Movement must continue even if the cease-fire lapses when it expires on January 15. He countered threats from the military and cabinet ministers who have called for tough action. President Wahid ordered Indonesian troops to stop attacking civilians and start building trust. However, in an ominous turn, Defense Minister Mohammad Mahfud said direct peace talks with the rebels will end after the ceasefire expires. \"From that time on there will be no more direct negotiations with the rebels, but if they like they can take part in talks between the government and Acehnese leaders,\" he told journalists.

      "body": "<p>Maestra failed to greet him in the vestibule, so Switters wandered the ground floor searching for her. Nearly a year has passed since he'd been in the house, but it was as he remembered it: spare, elegant, and spotless (Maestra had a professional housecleaning service come in twice a week; her meals she ordered delivered from Chinese and pizza take-out joints), and a dramatic contrast to the dumps in which her offspring - and their offspring had often resided. Maestra had done all right for herself. Above the living room fireplace was an Henri Matisse of a mountainous blue nude reclining, distorted limbs akimbo, on a jazzy patterned harem sofa. He was reasonably sure it was authentic. </p> <p>He found her in the library, perched at a computer. Much of the library was jammed with electronic equipment, twice the amount as on his last visit. Her collection of great books was now double and triple parked at one end of the room, while at the other end there were two computers, an array of modems, printers and telephones, a forty-inch television set into which a stack of black boxes was jacked, a fax machine and a helmet with goggles attached, which Switters took to be some type of virtual reality device. </p> <p>\"Maestra! Surfing so early in the day?\" </p> <p>\"Less traffic this time of the morning. Switters! Are you alone?\" </p> <p>\"Of course. Who'd I dare bring with me?\" </p> <p>Punching off-line, she swivelled to face him. \"Well, I did intercept an e-mail message in which you promised little Suzy you were gonna take her 'all the way to grandma's house.'\" Her affectionate gaze hardened into a glare. </p> <p>Switters blushed so incandescently he could have hired out his face as a beer sign. It was one of those instances, rare in his life, when he was at a loss for words. </p> <p>\"Perhaps that expression has some different connotation for you. Eh? Something I'm not hip to?\" Her smile was ironic and a tad malicious. \"After all, you've always exhibited the good taste not to refer to me as 'grandma.'\" </p> <p>\"Uh, er,\" Switters stammered, \"Suzy? Suzy's in Sacremento, how in hell did you access her email?\" </p> <p>\"Heh! Easy as pie. Child's play. You of all people ought to know that.\" The edges of her smile softened some. \"All right Switters Come here, Kiss those wrinkly old cheeks. It's a blessing to see you. A mixed blessing, but a blessing nontheless. Mmm. Boy. So what'd you bring me? Great, you know I'm crazy about mums. And a most fine pumpkin. Yes. Excellent damn pumpkin.\" Her disappointment in the presents was ill concealed. </p> <p>From his jacket pocket, he fished a Bakelite bracelet, pinkish butterscotch in tone. \"Found this in an antique shop in Paris. Guy claimed it belonged to Josephine Baker.\" </p> <p>\"Well, its mine now!\" Maestra was immoderately fond of bracelets, often wearing as many as ten on each thin arm. \"That's so thoughtful of you, Switters. So sweet.\" She paused, adding the bracelet to her jumble and admiring it there. \"But don't think this lets you off the hook, buddy boy. I don't have to tell you what a wicked degenerate you are.\" </p> <p>\"Oh, tell me anyway. I never tire of hearing it. Puts a spring in my step.\" </p> <p>\"You are a wicked degenerate. A rascal, a wastrel, a pervert... Don't look so pleased with yourself. This business with little Suzy is not funny. It's sick. What's more, it's criminally prosecutable. You've always been the most irresponsible-\" </p> <p>\"Now, now. How can you say that? I'm a dedicated, decorated public servant with a top-secret security clearance. Hardly the resume of a slacker.\" </p> <p>\"I'm supposed to sleep better nights knowing the likes of you is guarding the henhouse? It amazes me you've lasted in that job.\" </p> <p>\"Over a decade now.\" </p> <p>\"It amazes me they ever recruited you in the first place.\" </p> <p>\"It was my firm jaw and air of tragic nobility.\" </p> <p>\"It was your academic record.\" There was an irrepressible yeast of pride in her voice when she said, \"The dean of students at Berkely told me personally they'd never seen the likes of you when it came to cybnernetics and linguistics...\" </p> <p>\"Don't forget modern poetry. I had nine hours of modern poetry.\" </p> <p>\"He neglected to mention that. And the rugby fellow, that swarthy Englishman, he said you were the only American he'd ever coached who actually understood the game.\" </p> <p>\"Nigel was just buttering you up. He was consumed with desire for you. You drove him wild.\" </p> <p>\"Heh! Rubbish! I was a senior citizen even then. Rugby's barbaric. Worse than football. But there's no denying it, you hit the grade-point jackpot.\" </p> <p>\"Genes, Maestra. Abilities I inherited from you.\" </p> <p>\"Heh\" The old woman beamed in spite of herself. \"You were clever, in some areas, but I'm still surprised they'd recruit you, considering your extracurricular activities and your weak moral fiber.\" </p> <p>\"It's government service, Maestra. Morality's scarely an issue.\" </p> <p>\"You have a point there, unfortunately. So what monkey business has that agency of yours got its nose into now? What're you up to?

I believe she's going back to school.\" </p> <p>\"Of course she's going to school! She's a teenager!\" </p> <p>Maestra fell quiet and remained quiet for such a lengthy period that Switters wondered if she might have nodded off, as the elderly are wont to do. Either that or she was truly very angry. He cleared his throat. He cleared it again. Louder now. </p> <p>\"South America,\" she said abruptly. </p> <p>\"Yes.\" </p> <p>\"Nice.\" </p> <p>\"Not nice. No. South America holds a minimum of charm for this buckeroo.\" </p> <p>\"I suppose. The death squads, the poverty, the corruption, the destruction of nature.\" </p> <p>\"Hmm, well, yes, there's that.\" He scratched his himself, as if thinking of South America made him itch. \"And then there's the fact that it's just too goddamn vivid.\" </p> <p>She regarded him quizzically, but when she spoke she asked not what he meant by \"vivid\" but to what country, exactly, was he travelling in South America? </p> <p>\"Peru.\" </p> <p>\"Peru. Yes. That's what I understand. Lima, Peru.\" There followed anther long silence, but this time he could tell she wasn't drifting in any geriatric ozone. Her eyes simultaneously narrowed and brightened until they looked like apertures through which Tabasco droplets enter the world, and the zing zing zing zing of synapatic archery was very nearly audible. </p> <p>\"Jeez\" he muttered eventually, shaking his head. \"If J. Robert Oppenheimer had thought that hard, he'd have invented video poker instead of the A-bomb.\" </p> <p>Maestra smiled sardonically. \"Prove to me,\" she said, \"that chivalry can still eat lunch in this town.\" </p> <p>With a rattle of bracelets, she extended both arms. \"I need to be excused.\" </p> <p>Switters was taken back at how light she was, how frail. Her body was a husk compared to the meaty pulp of her spirit and her voice. Yet once he had helped her to her feet, she left the room rather briskly, barely relying on the rustic mahogany cane that she seemed to sport mainly for effect. He heard her rat-a-tatting it along the banister posts as she climbed the stairs. </p> <p>******</p> <p>After tossing his trench coat over a modem (underneath he wore a gray Irish tweed suit and a solid red T-shirt), he strolled to the library windows. Maestra's house sat high on the bluffs of he Magnolia District, so called because a botanically challenged early explorer had mistaken its profusion of madrona trees for an unrelated species that graced more southerly climes. Magnolia's cliffs overlooked the shipping lanes through which all manner of vessels, from warships to oil tankers to funky little salmon-snaggers, sailed from the Pacific to Seattle's docks by way of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound. Maestra's second husband had been a sea captain and owner of tugboats and he liked to keep an eye on the tides. On this drizzly day, the captain wouldn't have seen very much. The sky and the water looked like separate panels of the same chalk-fogged blackboard. Nature had erased the diagrammed sentences and multiplication tables, leaving a view that was all pan and not orama. </p> <p>Switters turned from the misty void and was instantly confronted with its opposite: namely a well-defined object of lurid coloration. It was the pumpkin, only its orangeness had become so intense it seemed to be undergoing spontaneous combustion right there on the library table. Switters didn't know whether to reach for a fire extinguisher or fall down and worship. The thing was blazing - and spinning, as well. At least, it appeared to be, for a minute or two. He blinked and rubbed his eyes. Then he remembered. </p> <p>He had forgotten about ingesting the XTC. It was starting to come on, and come on strong. Knowing that 150 milligrams of 3, 4 methylenedioxy-methamptehtamine, to call it by its rightful name, would not produce hallucinations, he figured that his present-moment awareness must be substantially heightened. With that in mind, he pulled up a chair and sat directly facing the gourd. It was no longer afire, but it was very pretty and very friendly, and Switters felt compelled to caress its haptic contours. </p> <p>\"We search for the door in the side of the pumpkin,\" he whispered, \"but unlike Cinderella's coach, it is drawn only by its own slow ripening.\" (Where was this coming from?) \"Distracted by the toothy glitter of com, mice leave it to round, to orange: a globe of lost continents, a faceless head, its true identity known only to the Halloween knife and certain deputies of the pie police. 0 pumpkin, pregnant squaw bladder, hardiest of moons, scarecrow's beachball, in the name of farmers' daughters everywhere, remove your hood and - \" </p> <p>\"Switters!\" Maestra had entered the room behind him. \"What the hell are you saying to that poor fruit? Is this what nine hours of modern poetry does to a man?\" </p> <p>\"My queen. You have returned.\" </p> <p>\"Christ, boy! See the frost is off your pumpkin. Have you finally gone around the bend?\" </p> <p>He smiled at her sweetly. Shyly, he studied his white sneakers. \"Maestra, would you mind putting on some music? I feel like dancing.\" </p> <p>\"Never mind the damn music. Sailor Boy and I want your undivided attention.\" </p> <p>It was then that he noticed the parrot. </p> <p>******</p> <p>How his grandmother, in her fragility, had managed to fetch Sailor's cage from her upstairs sitting room, Switters could not imagine. Although airily constructed of wicker and copper wire, it was spacious, as birdcages go, and probably none too light. Normally a sceptic, Maestra had become convinced that pyramids possessed the power to refresh and preserve organic tissue, whether of a plucked apple or a fully feathered bird, and inspired by an article on the subject in a reputable science magazine, she had long ago commissioned a craftsman to build her parrot a cage in the model of the Great Pyramid, although whether its geometric shape added to or subtracted from its total weight was something that had never been considered. Its impact on Sailor Boy's health was likewise unproven, yet no observer could dispute the salubrious sheen of his plumage. </p> <p>\"I'm aware,\" she said, \"of your antipathy toward animals.\" </p> <p>\"Why, that's slander, Maestra. I cherish all God's creatures, great and small.\" It was the XTC talking. The XTC grinning. </p> <p>\"Okay, pets then. I have it on good authority, namely you yourself, that you don't like pets. Why are you acting so goofy?\" </p> <p>He scratched his jaw in a pensive manner. \"It's cages I dislike. Cages and leashes and hobbles and halters. It's the taming I dislike. I appreciate that a pet can be a comfort to one such as yourself, but domesticity shrinks the soul of a beast. If God had meant for animals to five indoors, he would have given them second mortgages.\"</p> <p> \"It's the wild kingdom that you fancy.\" </p> <p>\"Well, sometimes nature has a tendency to go over the top, lay it on a bit thick with the creeping and crawling and sliming and hissing and stinging and ceaseless reproducing. But generally speaking, yes, my respect is for the thing that sniffs its prey instead of sniffing my crotch, the thing that shits in the elephant grass instead of shitting in a box in my kitchen.\" </p> <p>\"Your phrasing is indelicate, but your meaning is clear. You prefer your creatures wild and free. That's good. That's very good.\" </p> <p>\"Is it good, Maestra?\" His expression was that of a proud child who has just been praised for some trivial if heartfelt achievement. </p> <p>\"Yes, it's very damn good because it means that you are philosophically disposed to undertake the little mission I'm about to assign you.\" </p> <p>Switters blinked. He was in a drug-induced neurologically based state of blissful benevolence, a state in which ego was softened, fear dissolved, and trust expanded, yet through it all he sensed that he was about to be conned. </p> <p>It turned out that his grandmother wanted Switters to take Sailor the parrot with him to South America and release the bird in the jungle there. At her advanced age she faced the inevitable, and while its life expectancy was almost certainly greater than her own, the parrot, too, was no spring chicken. She wanted her pet to spend its remaining years flying free in the forest of its birth. </p> <p>\"But, but, uh,\" Switters sputtered, \"you've had Sailor for about as long as I can remember. . . .\" </p> <p>\"Thirty-four, thirty-five years. And he was at least that old when I acquired him.\" </p> <p>\"Sounds right. I'm thirty-six. So, why at this late date?\" </p> <p>\"Don't pretend to be a knucklehead. You know why. I've always assumed that he was leading a good life, but that may have been a chauvinistic presumption. I mean, he's behind bars, isn't he? You might recall that he used to be loose in the house, but in recent years he's taken to ripping up the draperies with his beak and committing other disagreeable and destructive deeds. He's undergone a personality change. You're the one who's claimed that all pets eventually become anthropomorphically neurotic. Correct? Anyway, I've had to keep him locked up. You have no idea how guilty I've felt. So it's for my conscience as well as for his 'shrunken soul' that I want you to liberate him.\" </p> <p>\"But, but I thought Sailor was from Brazil. He's a Brazilian parrot. I'm going to Peru.\" </p> <p>\"Quit speaking to me like I'm senile. Brazil, Peru - the Amazon jungle's the Amazon jungle. Birds and beasts don't recognise national boundaries. They have better sense.\" </p> <p>\"Okay, but I'm not going to the Amazon jungle. I'm going to Lima.\" His voice was fuzzy, and muffled by faux nonchalance. \"Lima's on the coast. There's desert around it. It's hundreds of kilometers from the Amazon.\" He turned to face the cage. Sailor was tearing at a bunch of grapes, but his head was cocked to the side, with one shiny orb trained on Switters, as if he could detect the man's abnormal state. \"Sorry, ole birdy, ol' pal, but if you expect to wing home to the emerald forest, you're gonna have to redeem your frequent-flyer miles.\" </p> <p>Maestra was neither amused nor dissuaded. \"Your tone disappoints me,\" she said. The pupils of his aforementioned fierce, hypnotic green eyes were so dilated they looked like the burners on a dollhouse stove. She stared into them without trepidation. \"A quick detour, that's all I'm asking. It may widen the pinhole in your travel map, but you're going to have to do it for me.\" </p> <p>\"Oh, no. No, no. It wouldn't be anywhere near quick enough for me. If I'm not out of South America within forty-eight hours, I will have forfeited all claim to future happiness. Can't do it, Maestra. It's an ordeal in the making, and it's too much to ask.\" </p> <p>She clapped her age-spotted hands together with such a sharp pop that it caused the parrot to start and flutter. \"Then I'm no longer asking. I'm insisting.\" </p> <p>Switters grinned. He loved the whole world at that moment, South America and a demanding old matriarch included, but he wasn't going to let himself be manipulated. \"You forget, I'm the only member of our family you've never been able to intimidate or control. That's why you adore me. So, you might as well - \" </p> <p>\"Heh! The reason I tolerate you, to the extent that I do tolerate you, is that you're the only one of us left with any tricks in his bag. In this case, I'm afraid, those very tricks of yours are your undoing.\" She paused briefly for the threat that was in it. \"You see, buddy boy, I happen to have on file every e-mail mash note you I've posted to Suzy in the past six months.\" </p> <p>\"No, you don't\" he blurted out confidently, but somehow he knew she wasn't bluffing. </p> <p>\"Want to bet?\" She went directly to the smaller and older of her two computers, the Mac Performa 6115, and within a few minutes had pulled up a text. \"All right, this one is dated thirty, September. Ahem. It reads, and I quote, 'I long to greet your delta like a rooster greets the dawn. ' \" </p> <p>\"Oh, dearie me.\" Blushing, he slumped in his chair and began to croon very softly, \"Send in the Clowns.\" </p> <p>******</p> <p>In the discussion that followed, the word blackmail fell many times from Switters's lips. He said it without rancor, she responded without guilt. </p> <p>\"I can't believe my own grandmother would stoop to blackmail.\" He shook his dark blond curls. He was bemused. </p> <p>\"Nobody else will believe it, either. But they'll have no choice but to believe the sordid evidence of Suzy's e-mail. I ask you again: Do you want your mother and stepfather to read those messages? Want your superiors in Virginia to read them? Mull it over.\" </p> <p>\"Blackmail most foul. No pun intended.\" </p> <p>\"It's for a good cause. Don't take it so hard. And you know, I've been contemplating updating my will. The Sierra Club probably wouldn't know what to do with the cabin at Snoqualmie, so I'm now considering, only considering, leaving it to you.\" </p> <p>\"I...\"</p> <p>\"Hush. Just listen. My Matisse that you've always been kind of gaga about? At present it's destined for the Seattle Art Museum, but 1 might be persuaded to keep it in the family. If Sailor was sprung free and my heart was at peace.\" </p> <p>\"Blackmail wasn't sin enough. Now you've added bribery.\" </p> <p>\"Yes. The old B and B. It doesn't get any better than that.\" </p> <p>\"You realised from the start that bribery alone wouldn't work.\" </p> <p>\"Materialism is one of the few vices you don't subscribe to. Yet, deep down, even you have a pitty-pat sense of self survival.\" </p> <p>He made a final effort to escape his fate. \"Perhaps this hasn't occurred to you, Maestra, not being a traveler, but a person can't just take live animals in and out of foreign countries. Most countries have strict quarantine laws regarding pets. I'll wager Peru - \"</p> <p>\"Switters! You're a CIA agent, for Christ's sake Surely you have ways of getting any manner of restricted items through the tightest of customs. You told me once it was like diplomatic immunity, only better.\" </p> <p>Defeated, he slumped further in his chair. In that position, he was Defeated, he slumped at eye level with the pumpkin, and he imagined he could detect its seeds spiraling inside of it like stars in a galaxy or bees in a hive. </p> <p>******</p> <p>Conspicuously pleased with herself, Maestra strutted over, bracelets clattering, and gently poked his neck with her cane. \"Sit up straight,boy. Do you want to be Quasimodo when you grow up?\" From somewhere in her richly brocaded kimono, she produced a thrice-folded sheet of crumpled pink paper. \"All this blackmail and bribery has given me an appetite. Let's do lunch!\" She slapped the cheap brochure and a cordless phone onto the table between him and the pumpkin. \"There's a new Thai restaurant opened in the Magnolia shopping area. Why don't you order for us? Five years in Bangkok should've given you a modicum of expertise!\"</p> <p>He ought to be hungry (except for a pint of Redhook ate at Pike Place Market, he'd had no breakfast) just as he ougbt to be furious with Maestra, yet thanks to the XTC, he was neither. \"Like sedated spacemen conserving their energy for the unimaginable encounters ahead, the pumpkin seeds lie suspended in their reticulum of slime!\" Those were the very words he whispered, but luckily she paid them no heed, having already moved to the pyramid to speak to the parrot. Unlike those old women who coo baby-talk to their birds, Maestra spoke to Sailor exactly as she spoke to everyone else, which is to say, with language that was fairly formal and occasionally flowery, a self-amused, ironic eloquence that to some degree, though he might deny it, had influenced Switters's own manner of speech. (As for the parrot, on those rare occasions when it spoke at all, it would utter but a single sentence, and it was always the same. \"Peeple of zee wurl, relax,\" is what it would say, as if giving sage advice in a raspy Spanish accent.) </p> <p>Seeing no route around it, and aiming to please, he studied the menu and picked up the phone. As he requested such dishes as tom kabug and pak tud tak, names that routinely sounded like a harelip pleading for a package of thumbtacks, the tricky tonalities of Thai didn't faze him. The waiter, in fact, mistook him for a fellow countryman, until Switters explained that despite his immaculate accent, he could not actually speak that tongue that in all probability had been invented by the ancient Asian ancestors of Elmer Fudd. </p> <p>In less than thirty minutes, cartons of aromatic food were clustered, steaming, on the library table. Wafts of lemongrass, chili paste, and coconut milk envlivened the technologized old room. </p> <p>After about five torrid forkfuls of pla lard prik, Maestra dozed off in her swivel chair and slept for hours. </p> <p>Switters didn't eat a bite, but danced alone in front of the CD player until deep in the dark afternoon. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Maestra failed to greet him in the vestibule, so Switters wandered the ground floor searching for her. Nearly a year has passed since he'd been in the house, but it was as he remembered it: spare, elegant, and spotless (Maestra had a professional housecleaning service come in twice a week; her meals she ordered delivered from Chinese and pizza take-out joints), and a dramatic contrast to the dumps in which her offspring - and their offspring had often resided. Maestra had done all right for herself. Above the living room fireplace was an Henri Matisse of a mountainous blue nude reclining, distorted limbs akimbo, on a jazzy patterned harem sofa. He was reasonably sure it was authentic. He found her in the library, perched at a computer. Much of the library was jammed with electronic equipment, twice the amount as on his last visit. Her collection of great books was now double and triple parked at one end of the room, while at the other end there were two computers, an array of modems, printers and telephones, a forty-inch television set into which a stack of black boxes was jacked, a fax machine and a helmet with goggles attached, which Switters took to be some type of virtual reality device. \"Maestra! Surfing so early in the day?\" \"Less traffic this time of the morning. Switters! Are you alone?\" \"Of course. Who'd I dare bring with me?\" Punching off-line, she swivelled to face him. \"Well, I did intercept an e-mail message in which you promised little Suzy you were gonna take her 'all the way to grandma's house.'\" Her affectionate gaze hardened into a glare. Switters blushed so incandescently he could have hired out his face as a beer sign. It was one of those instances, rare in his life, when he was at a loss for words. \"Perhaps that expression has some different connotation for you. Eh? Something I'm not hip to?\" Her smile was ironic and a tad malicious. \"After all, you've always exhibited the good taste not to refer to me as 'grandma.'\" \"Uh, er,\" Switters stammered, \"Suzy? Suzy's in Sacremento, how in hell did you access her email?\" \"Heh! Easy as pie. Child's play. You of all people ought to know that.\" The edges of her smile softened some. \"All right Switters Come here, Kiss those wrinkly old cheeks. It's a blessing to see you. A mixed blessing, but a blessing nontheless. Mmm. Boy. So what'd you bring me? Great, you know I'm crazy about mums. And a most fine pumpkin. Yes. Excellent damn pumpkin.\" Her disappointment in the presents was ill concealed. From his jacket pocket, he fished a Bakelite bracelet, pinkish butterscotch in tone. \"Found this in an antique shop in Paris. Guy claimed it belonged to Josephine Baker.\" \"Well, its mine now!\" Maestra was immoderately fond of bracelets, often wearing as many as ten on each thin arm. \"That's so thoughtful of you, Switters. So sweet.\" She paused, adding the bracelet to her jumble and admiring it there. \"But don't think this lets you off the hook, buddy boy. I don't have to tell you what a wicked degenerate you are.\" \"Oh, tell me anyway. I never tire of hearing it. Puts a spring in my step.\" \"You are a wicked degenerate. A rascal, a wastrel, a pervert... Don't look so pleased with yourself. This business with little Suzy is not funny. It's sick. What's more, it's criminally prosecutable. You've always been the most irresponsible-\" \"Now, now. How can you say that? I'm a dedicated, decorated public servant with a top-secret security clearance. Hardly the resume of a slacker.\" \"I'm supposed to sleep better nights knowing the likes of you is guarding the henhouse? It amazes me you've lasted in that job.\" \"Over a decade now.\" \"It amazes me they ever recruited you in the first place.\" \"It was my firm jaw and air of tragic nobility.\" \"It was your academic record.\" There was an irrepressible yeast of pride in her voice when she said, \"The dean of students at Berkely told me personally they'd never seen the likes of you when it came to cybnernetics and linguistics...\" \"Don't forget modern poetry. I had nine hours of modern poetry.\" \"He neglected to mention that. And the rugby fellow, that swarthy Englishman, he said you were the only American he'd ever coached who actually understood the game.\" \"Nigel was just buttering you up. He was consumed with desire for you. You drove him wild.\" \"Heh! Rubbish! I was a senior citizen even then. Rugby's barbaric. Worse than football. But there's no denying it, you hit the grade-point jackpot.\" \"Genes, Maestra. Abilities I inherited from you.\" \"Heh\" The old woman beamed in spite of herself. \"You were clever, in some areas, but I'm still surprised they'd recruit you, considering your extracurricular activities and your weak moral fiber.\" \"It's government service, Maestra. Morality's scarely an issue.\" \"You have a point there, unfortunately. So what monkey business has that agency of yours got its nose into now? What're you up to? What're you doing in Seattle? How long before you leave me?\" \"Upon the rosy-fingered dawn.\" \"Tomorrow? No!\" \"I fly to South America first thing in the morning - but I'll be back in a wink. Actually, I'm supposed to be starting a thirty-day leave, but the yard boss insisted I postpone it just long enough to dash down to Lima and back. Really, I'll probably only be there overnight.\" He saw her eyes narrow behind her spectacles. \"Assassination?\" \"I don't do windows. You've been watching too much TV. Company recruited a very promising young dude down there, indigenous operative, fronted him a new Honda as a signing bonus, and now he's backing out on the deal.\" \"You're ready to terminate him with extreme prejudice.\" \"Get real, I'm gonna lobby him, try to talk him into staying aboard.\" \"Why you?\" \"I guess because we have similar backgrounds. He earned a double master's from the University of Miami. Computer science and languages.\" \"No modern poetry?\" She was needling him. \"Me thinks not, Maestra, But I bet he can quote a line or two from Howl\" \"And what'll you do on your vacation? May I expect another intrusion?\" \"Absolutely. Another bangle, too. First thing, when I get back. Uh, I was hoping you'd let me use the cabin up at Snoqualmie Pass for a week or two. I've sucked way too much cement this year. But juju rising off them city sidewalks. I need to babble with a brook or two, inhale starlight, make friends with some trees. Then I may hop over to Sacramento briefly, regale the family.\" \"Including Suzy?\" \"Uh, well, uh Suzy quite possibly may be on the premises. I believe she's going back to school.\" \"Of course she's going to school! She's a teenager!\" Maestra fell quiet and remained quiet for such a lengthy period that Switters wondered if she might have nodded off, as the elderly are wont to do. Either that or she was truly very angry. He cleared his throat. He cleared it again. Louder now. \"South America,\" she said abruptly. \"Yes.\" \"Nice.\" \"Not nice. No. South America holds a minimum of charm for this buckeroo.\" \"I suppose. The death squads, the poverty, the corruption, the destruction of nature.\" \"Hmm, well, yes, there's that.\" He scratched his himself, as if thinking of South America made him itch. \"And then there's the fact that it's just too goddamn vivid.\" She regarded him quizzically, but when she spoke she asked not what he meant by \"vivid\" but to what country, exactly, was he travelling in South America? \"Peru.\" \"Peru. Yes. That's what I understand. Lima, Peru.\" There followed anther long silence, but this time he could tell she wasn't drifting in any geriatric ozone. Her eyes simultaneously narrowed and brightened until they looked like apertures through which Tabasco droplets enter the world, and the zing zing zing zing of synapatic archery was very nearly audible. \"Jeez\" he muttered eventually, shaking his head. \"If J. Robert Oppenheimer had thought that hard, he'd have invented video poker instead of the A-bomb.\" Maestra smiled sardonically. \"Prove to me,\" she said, \"that chivalry can still eat lunch in this town.\" With a rattle of bracelets, she extended both arms. \"I need to be excused.\" Switters was taken back at how light she was, how frail. Her body was a husk compared to the meaty pulp of her spirit and her voice. Yet once he had helped her to her feet, she left the room rather briskly, barely relying on the rustic mahogany cane that she seemed to sport mainly for effect. He heard her rat-a-tatting it along the banister posts as she climbed the stairs. ****** After tossing his trench coat over a modem (underneath he wore a gray Irish tweed suit and a solid red T-shirt), he strolled to the library windows.

Normally a sceptic, Maestra had become convinced that pyramids possessed the power to refresh and preserve organic tissue, whether of a plucked apple or a fully feathered bird, and inspired by an article on the subject in a reputable science magazine, she had long ago commissioned a craftsman to build her parrot a cage in the model of the Great Pyramid, although whether its geometric shape added to or subtracted from its total weight was something that had never been considered. Its impact on Sailor Boy's health was likewise unproven, yet no observer could dispute the salubrious sheen of his plumage. \"I'm aware,\" she said, \"of your antipathy toward animals.\" \"Why, that's slander, Maestra. I cherish all God's creatures, great and small.\" It was the XTC talking. The XTC grinning. \"Okay, pets then. I have it on good authority, namely you yourself, that you don't like pets. Why are you acting so goofy?\" He scratched his jaw in a pensive manner. \"It's cages I dislike. Cages and leashes and hobbles and halters. It's the taming I dislike. I appreciate that a pet can be a comfort to one such as yourself, but domesticity shrinks the soul of a beast. If God had meant for animals to five indoors, he would have given them second mortgages.\" \"It's the wild kingdom that you fancy.\" \"Well, sometimes nature has a tendency to go over the top, lay it on a bit thick with the creeping and crawling and sliming and hissing and stinging and ceaseless reproducing. But generally speaking, yes, my respect is for the thing that sniffs its prey instead of sniffing my crotch, the thing that shits in the elephant grass instead of shitting in a box in my kitchen.\" \"Your phrasing is indelicate, but your meaning is clear. You prefer your creatures wild and free. That's good. That's very good.\" \"Is it good, Maestra?\" His expression was that of a proud child who has just been praised for some trivial if heartfelt achievement. \"Yes, it's very damn good because it means that you are philosophically disposed to undertake the little mission I'm about to assign you.\" Switters blinked. He was in a drug-induced neurologically based state of blissful benevolence, a state in which ego was softened, fear dissolved, and trust expanded, yet through it all he sensed that he was about to be conned. It turned out that his grandmother wanted Switters to take Sailor the parrot with him to South America and release the bird in the jungle there. At her advanced age she faced the inevitable, and while its life expectancy was almost certainly greater than her own, the parrot, too, was no spring chicken. She wanted her pet to spend its remaining years flying free in the forest of its birth. \"But, but, uh,\" Switters sputtered, \"you've had Sailor for about as long as I can remember. . . .\" \"Thirty-four, thirty-five years. And he was at least that old when I acquired him.\" \"Sounds right. I'm thirty-six. So, why at this late date?\" \"Don't pretend to be a knucklehead. You know why. I've always assumed that he was leading a good life, but that may have been a chauvinistic presumption. I mean, he's behind bars, isn't he? You might recall that he used to be loose in the house, but in recent years he's taken to ripping up the draperies with his beak and committing other disagreeable and destructive deeds. He's undergone a personality change. You're the one who's claimed that all pets eventually become anthropomorphically neurotic. Correct? Anyway, I've had to keep him locked up. You have no idea how guilty I've felt. So it's for my conscience as well as for his 'shrunken soul' that I want you to liberate him.\" \"But, but I thought Sailor was from Brazil. He's a Brazilian parrot. I'm going to Peru.\" \"Quit speaking to me like I'm senile. Brazil, Peru - the Amazon jungle's the Amazon jungle. Birds and beasts don't recognise national boundaries. They have better sense.\" \"Okay, but I'm not going to the Amazon jungle. I'm going to Lima.\" His voice was fuzzy, and muffled by faux nonchalance. \"Lima's on the coast. There's desert around it. It's hundreds of kilometers from the Amazon.\" He turned to face the cage. Sailor was tearing at a bunch of grapes, but his head was cocked to the side, with one shiny orb trained on Switters, as if he could detect the man's abnormal state. \"Sorry, ole birdy, ol' pal, but if you expect to wing home to the emerald forest, you're gonna have to redeem your frequent-flyer miles.\" Maestra was neither amused nor dissuaded. \"Your tone disappoints me,\" she said. The pupils of his aforementioned fierce, hypnotic green eyes were so dilated they looked like the burners on a dollhouse stove. She stared into them without trepidation. \"A quick detour, that's all I'm asking. It may widen the pinhole in your travel map, but you're going to have to do it for me.\" \"Oh, no. No, no. It wouldn't be anywhere near quick enough for me. If I'm not out of South America within forty-eight hours, I will have forfeited all claim to future happiness. Can't do it, Maestra. It's an ordeal in the making, and it's too much to ask.\" She clapped her age-spotted hands together with such a sharp pop that it caused the parrot to start and flutter. \"Then I'm no longer asking. I'm insisting.\" Switters grinned. He loved the whole world at that moment, South America and a demanding old matriarch included, but he wasn't going to let himself be manipulated. \"You forget, I'm the only member of our family you've never been able to intimidate or control. That's why you adore me. So, you might as well - \" \"Heh! The reason I tolerate you, to the extent that I do tolerate you, is that you're the only one of us left with any tricks in his bag. In this case, I'm afraid, those very tricks of yours are your undoing.\" She paused briefly for the threat that was in it. \"You see, buddy boy, I happen to have on file every e-mail mash note you I've posted to Suzy in the past six months.\" \"No, you don't\" he blurted out confidently, but somehow he knew she wasn't bluffing. \"Want to bet?\" She went directly to the smaller and older of her two computers, the Mac Performa 6115, and within a few minutes had pulled up a text. \"All right, this one is dated thirty, September. Ahem. It reads, and I quote, 'I long to greet your delta like a rooster greets the dawn. ' \" \"Oh, dearie me.\" Blushing, he slumped in his chair and began to croon very softly, \"Send in the Clowns.\" ****** In the discussion that followed, the word blackmail fell many times from Switters's lips. He said it without rancor, she responded without guilt. \"I can't believe my own grandmother would stoop to blackmail.\" He shook his dark blond curls. He was bemused. \"Nobody else will believe it, either. But they'll have no choice but to believe the sordid evidence of Suzy's e-mail. I ask you again: Do you want your mother and stepfather to read those messages? Want your superiors in Virginia to read them? Mull it over.\" \"Blackmail most foul. No pun intended.\" \"It's for a good cause. Don't take it so hard. And you know, I've been contemplating updating my will. The Sierra Club probably wouldn't know what to do with the cabin at Snoqualmie, so I'm now considering, only considering, leaving it to you.\" \"I...\" \"Hush. Just listen. My Matisse that you've always been kind of gaga about? At present it's destined for the Seattle Art Museum, but 1 might be persuaded to keep it in the family. If Sailor was sprung free and my heart was at peace.\" \"Blackmail wasn't sin enough. Now you've added bribery.\" \"Yes. The old B and B. It doesn't get any better than that.\" \"You realised from the start that bribery alone wouldn't work.\" \"Materialism is one of the few vices you don't subscribe to. Yet, deep down, even you have a pitty-pat sense of self survival.\" He made a final effort to escape his fate. \"Perhaps this hasn't occurred to you, Maestra, not being a traveler, but a person can't just take live animals in and out of foreign countries. Most countries have strict quarantine laws regarding pets. I'll wager Peru - \" \"Switters! You're a CIA agent, for Christ's sake Surely you have ways of getting any manner of restricted items through the tightest of customs. You told me once it was like diplomatic immunity, only better.\" Defeated, he slumped further in his chair. In that position, he was Defeated, he slumped at eye level with the pumpkin, and he imagined he could detect its seeds spiraling inside of it like stars in a galaxy or bees in a hive. ****** Conspicuously pleased with herself, Maestra strutted over, bracelets clattering, and gently poked his neck with her cane. \"Sit up straight,boy. Do you want to be Quasimodo when you grow up?\" From somewhere in her richly brocaded kimono, she produced a thrice-folded sheet of crumpled pink paper. \"All this blackmail and bribery has given me an appetite. Let's do lunch!\" She slapped the cheap brochure and a cordless phone onto the table between him and the pumpkin. \"There's a new Thai restaurant opened in the Magnolia shopping area. Why don't you order for us? Five years in Bangkok should've given you a modicum of expertise!\" He ought to be hungry (except for a pint of Redhook ate at Pike Place Market, he'd had no breakfast) just as he ougbt to be furious with Maestra, yet thanks to the XTC, he was neither. \"Like sedated spacemen conserving their energy for the unimaginable encounters ahead, the pumpkin seeds lie suspended in their reticulum of slime!\" Those were the very words he whispered, but luckily she paid them no heed, having already moved to the pyramid to speak to the parrot. Unlike those old women who coo baby-talk to their birds, Maestra spoke to Sailor exactly as she spoke to everyone else, which is to say, with language that was fairly formal and occasionally flowery, a self-amused, ironic eloquence that to some degree, though he might deny it, had influenced Switters's own manner of speech. (As for the parrot, on those rare occasions when it spoke at all, it would utter but a single sentence, and it was always the same. \"Peeple of zee wurl, relax,\" is what it would say, as if giving sage advice in a raspy Spanish accent.) Seeing no route around it, and aiming to please, he studied the menu and picked up the phone. As he requested such dishes as tom kabug and pak tud tak, names that routinely sounded like a harelip pleading for a package of thumbtacks, the tricky tonalities of Thai didn't faze him. The waiter, in fact, mistook him for a fellow countryman, until Switters explained that despite his immaculate accent, he could not actually speak that tongue that in all probability had been invented by the ancient Asian ancestors of Elmer Fudd. In less than thirty minutes, cartons of aromatic food were clustered, steaming, on the library table. Wafts of lemongrass, chili paste, and coconut milk envlivened the technologized old room. After about five torrid forkfuls of pla lard prik, Maestra dozed off in her swivel chair and slept for hours. Switters didn't eat a bite, but danced alone in front of the CD player until deep in the dark afternoon.",

A marquee had been erected in the garden of the Virgin chief's Georgian home, and inside chilled champagne bottles stood waiting to be uncorked. </p> <p>From the sense of expectation visible on the faces not just of Branson's staff, but also his wife and family, it was clear Sir Richard did not expect to lose. </p> <p>When the bad news came faces dropped and somewhere at the back of the marquee a champagne flute smashed. Sir Richard emerged to deliver a stinging rebuke to those in government and on the lottery commission who he believed had delivered this defeat: </p> <p>\"It goes without saying we are sad, disappointed and baffled. </p> <p>\"Having said that obviously we congratulate Camelot for a good fight for being able to turn the decision ... </p> <p>\"Four out of the five judges had voted for the People's Lottery only two and a half months ago. One new judge turns up and somehow manages to turn a number of them round. </p> <p>\"This government was elected on the basis that they would create a lottery in which all the profits went to the good causes. It was an election pledge and it's not being honoured and it's sad I think to see that one civil servant [Lord Burns] can be appointed to a commission and change things round so dramatically without speaking to us, without ever answering my phone calls ...</p> <p>\"We have glanced through the reasons they have given - they have acknowledged that our costs are much less than Camelot and that the income is much greater. We haven't really absorbed the reasons but they look pretty superficial. </p> <p>\"Last week was the lowest takings ever for the lottery. It needed a change. The people of Britain wanted to see a change - desperately wanted to see a change - and the sad thing is that charities and good causes up and down the country will suffer. </p> <p>\"It's cost us \u00a340m but we believe something like a billion and a half pounds extra money has gone to good causes by our bidding, not just this time but the first time round as well. \" </p> <p>His anger vented there was still time for one more stunt, one rich in irony given the circumstances. A coach pulled by four horses drew up outside the house and Santa Claus leapt off with a sack of presents. Before he could hand them out, however, an actor playing Scrooge emerged and dragged St Nick away.</p>",

From the sense of expectation visible on the faces not just of Branson's staff, but also his wife and family, it was clear Sir Richard did not expect to lose. When the bad news came faces dropped and somewhere at the back of the marquee a champagne flute smashed. Sir Richard emerged to deliver a stinging rebuke to those in government and on the lottery commission who he believed had delivered this defeat: \"It goes without saying we are sad, disappointed and baffled. \"Having said that obviously we congratulate Camelot for a good fight for being able to turn the decision ... \"Four out of the five judges had voted for the People's Lottery only two and a half months ago. One new judge turns up and somehow manages to turn a number of them round. \"This government was elected on the basis that they would create a lottery in which all the profits went to the good causes. It was an election pledge and it's not being honoured and it's sad I think to see that one civil servant [Lord Burns] can be appointed to a commission and change things round so dramatically without speaking to us, without ever answering my phone calls ... \"We have glanced through the reasons they have given - they have acknowledged that our costs are much less than Camelot and that the income is much greater. We haven't really absorbed the reasons but they look pretty superficial. \"Last week was the lowest takings ever for the lottery. It needed a change. The people of Britain wanted to see a change - desperately wanted to see a change - and the sad thing is that charities and good causes up and down the country will suffer. \"It's cost us \u00a340m but we believe something like a billion and a half pounds extra money has gone to good causes by our bidding, not just this time but the first time round as well. \" His anger vented there was still time for one more stunt, one rich in irony given the circumstances. A coach pulled by four horses drew up outside the house and Santa Claus leapt off with a sack of presents. Before he could hand them out, however, an actor playing Scrooge emerged and dragged St Nick away.",

The previous commissioner spent months with us, analysing our game plans and marketing strategy. All that Lord Burns has done is come in, read the documents and change the other commissioners' minds. The reality is that people, the players, wanted the People's Lottery to win.\" In a long statement of reasons for rejecting the People's Lottery, the commission returned repeatedly to the suggestion that it was more risky to appoint a new operator. The commission also said it believed Camelot would register higher sales. Camelot which has run the lottery since its launch six years ago has so far raised more than \u00a39bn for good causes. There was inevitable speculation that the publication of a critical biography of Sir Richard by investigative journalist Tom Bower may have had some influence. The process of awarding the next licence which runs from October next year has been plagued with difficulty. The former chairwoman of the commission, Dame Helena Shovelton, resigned after her decision to pursue exclusive negotiations with Sir Richard's bid was overturned in court and described as \"conspicuously unfair\". Camelot has promised to raise \u00a315bn for good causes during the next seven year licence, almost 50% higher than the current term. It will keep the existing game format of six numbers from 49, as well as Thunderball and the Instants scratchcards. New elements will include at least four additional online games and a greater choice of ways to play through the internet, mobile phones and interactive television.Ms Thompson promised \u00a31bn of investment in new terminals, marketing and infrastructure.

      "body": "<p>At 8.30am on Monday, the five members of the National Lottery Commission locked themselves away to assess the two bids for the next seven-year licence to run the game. </p> <p>Four of them had been there before. On that occasion, in mid-August, they came to the unanimous conclusion that the commission should proceed with exclusive negotiations with Sir Richard Branson's People's Lottery, consigning Camelot to history. </p> <p>By the time they emerged from a gruelling 12-hour meeting late on Monday evening, however, all but one commission member had changed their minds. The lottery was back in Camelot's hands. The lone voice of dissent, Hilary Blume, resigned from the commission to express her dissatisfaction. </p> <p>Two things had happened in the intervening months. The first was the appointment of Lord Burns, who was parachuted in as commission chairman after Dame Helena Shovelton's dramatic resignation. Second was probably the most spirited piece of scrapping that the corporate world has seen from Camelot, which culminated in Dame Helena's departure from office. </p> <p>If ever there was an example of victory being snatched from the jaws of defeat, then Camelot's Lazarus-like recovery was it. Capitalising on the commission's mishandling of the bidding process, it underwent a transformation from one of the most vilified companies in Britain to being cast as the underdog in an unfair contest for the licence. The groans which might otherwise have been expected on its victory yesterday were replaced with nods that justice had been done. </p> <p>The lengthy negotiations on Monday seem to suggest that this may not have been as clear cut a decision as some reports made out. </p> <p>When he was appointed in October Lord Burns was warmly welcomed by both camps, but Sir Richard was yesterday left cursing what he described as the whim of one civil servant defeating his long held ambitions. Simon Burridge, chief executive of the People's Lottery, was incandescent over the role that Lord Burns had played. \"He has imposed his own will on the rest of the commission. Our bids haven't changed and suddenly everything's turned around. It was a fantastically shoddy performance.\" </p> <p>Lord Burns clearly demonstrated in his judgment that he was risk averse, choosing the safer option of the tried and tested operator. There was, he said, \"more uncertainty\" surrounding the People's Lottery. He appeared to suggest that it would be highly unlikely that any company could successfully challenge Camelot. </p> <p>The statement of reasons also suggested that Camelot was likely to achieve higher sales, that Sir Richard's bid had underestimated the costs of starting up and that his changes to the game format were too risky. The financial robustness of the People's Lottery was also questioned. The decision, however, may have compromised Lord Burns's fellow commissioners who had lent towards the People's Lottery bid in the earlier decision. </p> <p>No substantive changes had been allowed in either bid between the August pronouncement and yesterday's decision - Camelot and the People's Lottery were merely given the chance to belie very specific concerns. For that reason, the People's Lottery believes that it may be able to fight the latest decision in the courts. </p> <p>There was one figure who proved even more influential than the commission chairman. Lord Burns would not have been appointed had it not been for the efforts of Dianne Thompson, the feisty chief executive-designate who waged Camelot's campaign. For her, yesterday's decision was a personal triumph. </p> <p>She owns to having met Sir Richard only twice. The first time was on the sofa at GMTV. After they left the studio, his one remark to her was allegedly that she was very short. On the second occasion, at a party, he spoke with confidence about his chances of winning, before she reminded him that they had met before, and that she worked for Camelot. </p> <p>Sir Richard, it would seem, underestimated his diminutive opponent. He yesterday conceded that she had put up a \"great fight\". </p> <p>A single mother and self avowed straight talking Yorkshire woman, she did much to dispel the fat cat, profiteering image that had blighted the company. A Co-op butcher's daughter from Batley, the impression she left was instead of a passionate and fair minded campaigner. </p> <p><strong>Infamous</strong><br> </p> <p>Her career included a spell as marketing director of Woolworths and then Signet, the retailer which owned the Ratners jewellery chain, where she had the task of turning the business around in the wake of the infamous \"crap\" comment. </p> <p>Before taking the top job at Camelot she had been commercial operations director at the company. She unsurprisingly noted that Lord Burns was a man \"with the courage to make the right decision\". </p> <p>The invitation to tender for the licence from October next year was made in November 1999 and the outcome was twice delayed before events turned in mid-August. </p> <p>Despite running what experts argue is the most successful national lottery in the world, Camelot began the fight against Sir Richard with the odds stacked against it. </p> <p>It has to date raised \u00a39.2bn for good causes, but its stewardship of the lottery has been dogged with controversy. From dramatic slumps in the sale of scratchcards, to front page headlines crying foul play over the size of its profits and fatcat accusations over its directors' high pay, Camelot has not had an easy ride. </p> <p>But the real damage was done by Camelot's chief software supplier, the US firm GTech. In February, a whistleblower informed the commission that GTech had covered up a software glitch which had caused some winners to be shortchanged. The story proved incendiary. </p> <p>Neither was this the first time that GTech had sullied Camelot's reputation. Guy Snowdon, the former chairman, was forced to resign after losing a libel case against Sir Richard, who alleged that GTech had attempted to bribe him to withdraw during the last round of bidding in the early 1990s. </p> <p>On the decision day in August, Camelot's bid was dismissed because of fears over the probity of GTech, despite the resignations of the men responsible for covering up the software problems. The prevarications of the commission worked in Camelot's favour, by making the company look as though it had been wronged. Dame Helena also left a chink of light for Camelot by giving Sir Richard one month to allay the commission's concerns about the robustness of his bid, instead of simply awarding the licence to the People's Lottery and continuing discussions on the fine print in private. </p> <p>Within two days Camelot had applied for a judicial review that was to prove pivotal. Dame Helena's decision was thrown out in a judgement that the commission had been \"conspicuously unfair\". Camelot was back in the game and had a month to revise its bid. </p> <p><strong>Bruising</strong><br> </p> <p>The bruising encounter between Camelot and the commission that followed resulted in Dame Helena's resignation. A relentless campaign in the media ensued, culminating in the contention that Dame Helena had subjected the company to a \"gratuitous insult\" with a half-hearted apology signed by one of her aparatchiks. </p> <p>When Camelot scheduled a board meeting to decide whether to call for Dame Helena's resignation, she quit, claiming she had been a target of \"personal vilification\" in the media. </p> <p>Camelot had already done much to repair its public image. Ms Thompson's \u00a3330,000 salary is a third lower than her predecessor's, and further bonuses have been ruled out. Dividends to shareholders have been halved. </p> <p>In the additional month, Camelot severed its relationship with GTech by buying its UK operation. </p> <p>Its bid was backed by the Post Office and a promised \u00a315bn will be raised for good causes during the life of the licence. </p> <p>The suspicion among some that the commission had been coloured by political values which preferred Sir Richard's non-profit making bid also probably aided Camelot. The real loser in the process though was not Sir Richard but the commission itself, and, by association, the culture secretary, Chris Smith, who appointed its members. The questions about how the process could so desperately lose credibility are only just beginning. </p> <p><strong>Statements</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/lottery/story/0,7369,413551,00.html\">The lottery commission</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/lottery/story/0,7369,413558,00.html\">Hilary Blume: why I resigned</a></p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/lottery/story/0,7369,412968,00.html\">Explained: the lottery bids</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/lottery/story/0,7369,395428,00.html\">November 10 2000: The debate between who will run the lottery continues </a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.national-lottery.co.uk/\">National lottery</a><br><a href=\"http://www.natlotcomm.gov.uk\">The Lottery Commission</a><br><a href=\"http://www.camelotplc.com/\">Camelot</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.thepeopleslottery.co.uk/\">People's Lottery</a></p>",

Prior to taking the job he chaired the government's inquiry into hunting, which was widely viewed as giving grist to the anti-hunting lobby. The appointment of one of Whitehall's most experienced figures was viewed as a signal that the culture secretary, Chris Smith, hoped to restore some credibility to the tarnished bidding process. Whether he has managed to do so will depend largely on whether Sir Richard Bran son decides to challenge the commission's decision in the courts. The merits of a non-profit making bid such as the People's Lottery's were always likely to be lost on Lord Burns. He was a Thatcherite appointee to the Treasury, where he worked for almost 20 years.

Perhaps most worryingly, she did not deny that she gives children fishfingers as Christmas presents. I admit I was going out on a limb with that one and couldn't have backed it up if challenged, but it seems to be a gamble that paid off, because we must assume it's true. </p> <p>In fact, she did not deny that the Asylum Support Regulations published this year define toys as not being an \"essential living need\", which means that the level of support for refugees was calculated expressly to exclude the possibility of their buying toys. Since those were the government's words, Ms Roche is hard-pressed to shake them off, although bolder ministers would try. I believe the correct thing for politicians to say about something like that is: \"We were trying to start a debate\". Instead, Ms Roche tells us that refugees \"can use their vouchers in 23,500 retail outlets on anything they want\". I suppose that's true; they could buy the kid a pony if they starved her for a year and Asda had one in stock. </p> <p>It is hard to develop a clear picture of exactly what's happening nationwide, because the asylum support system is in chaos. Which shops are designated to take vouchers varies from place to place, and the items that shops will exchange for them vary even more. With refugees dispersed to all kinds of remote places, there is no guarantee that they can spend their vouchers anywhere nearby at all. The ones in prison get no vouchers but full board and free racial abuse. </p> <p>The main point about vouchers is that their function is to humiliate vulnerable people and make them identifiable in communities that might already be reluctant to accept them. The only people who benefit from the scheme are the far right, the supermarkets, the Sodexho corporation which prints the vouchers, and the government, which gets to demonstrate that it is tough on toys and tough on the causes of toys. If, as Ms Roche suggests, the level of support is similar to that provided to other welfare claimants, the scheme is more expensive than paying cash. </p> <p>In fact, when Ms Roche says that the support given by NASS is \"broadly equivalent to income support levels\", she is right only to the extent that it's less. It is true that, although the value of vouchers is much lower than income support, refugees get a few other bits and bobs that partly close the gap. When everything is added up, refugees get about 80% of income support, quite a bit less than not very much. Moreover, \"free furnished accommodation\" is a grandiose way of describing the holes into which asylum seekers and other welfare claimants are dumped. In fact, most of the places laughably called \"hotels\" have got some furniture in them. Refugees are not disporting themselves on the finest chaises longues while single mums in the same B&amp;B sit enviously on metal spikes. In many cases, the accommodation on offer is much the same, but again, systems vary around the country, and landlords are a law unto themselves. </p> <p>The dispersal system itself is pure harassment. Recently, a refugee was sent from the Tees Valley to Leicester, away from his best friend and only known contact in the UK, on the pretext that there was no single male accommodation available. The same day, a man in Leicester was dispersed to the Tees Valley. </p> <p>But, in any case, is not Gordon Brown furious that, while he talks up his munificence, the Home Office brags that all welfare claimants live miserably, not just asylum seekers? In April, Jack Straw reassured the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture that, for all those on welfare, \"there is equally no special provision made for toys\".

She immediately told her boss, Michael Oates, who appeared \"irritated\". Five minutes later, a colleague told her she was being sacked for being unreliable. </p> <p>An employment tribunal in Manchester reached a unanimous decision in favour of Ms Percy, after reserving judgment in October. A compensation payout, based on loss of earnings, is to be decided. But Ms Percy found a new job one day after being dismissed from the \u00a311,000 a year post, so she will receive only one day's pay. </p> <p>\"This claim is not about money, it is about the principle of parents' rights,\" she said yesterday. \"It is wrong to say that single mothers are the only ones who suffer. </p> <p>\"The issues of sick children affect any couple where both parents work. I realised I had my commitments to work and I did not want to leave them without a secretary but Thomas had a very infectious complaint. I just wanted to do what was best.\" </p> <p>Ms Percy had worked at the company for six weeks. Mr Oates told the tribunal he sacked her because she was unreliable, impolite and had an attitude problem. She had arrived 30 minutes late for work on another occasion because her son was ill. But she had also been praised by the firm and had been given two bottles of wine as a reward for good work. </p> <p>Mr Oates said Ms Percy did not ask to go and pick up her son, but told him she was leaving, presenting the decision as a fait accompli. He said he regarded this as an example of a bad attitude and \"the last straw\". </p> <p>The employment tribunal rejected the company's claim that Ms Percy was sacked not because she had to pick up her child, but because of the way she asked. </p> <p>Her solicitor, John Cook, said three similar claims had been lodged in different parts of the country but this was the first ruling under the regulations which were added to the 1996 Employment Rights Act. He said the case would set a precedent for parents. </p> <p>\"There has been a plethora of changes in employment law in the past two years and companies need to be aware of this before taking such drastic action,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Employees now have more rights than ever, regardless of how long they have worked for the company.\" </p> <p>Christine Gowdridge, director of Maternity Alliance, which campaigns for balance between work and childcare, said: \"This case is quite extraordinary because there is a very straightforward legal right to take time off if your child is sick and particularly in an emergency. </p> <p>\"It is quite right that the claim was won and maybe it will publicise this little known right that everyone has to care for a sick dependant, even an elderly relative.\"</p>",

She had arrived 30 minutes late for work on another occasion because her son was ill. But she had also been praised by the firm and had been given two bottles of wine as a reward for good work. Mr Oates said Ms Percy did not ask to go and pick up her son, but told him she was leaving, presenting the decision as a fait accompli. He said he regarded this as an example of a bad attitude and \"the last straw\". The employment tribunal rejected the company's claim that Ms Percy was sacked not because she had to pick up her child, but because of the way she asked. Her solicitor, John Cook, said three similar claims had been lodged in different parts of the country but this was the first ruling under the regulations which were added to the 1996 Employment Rights Act. He said the case would set a precedent for parents. \"There has been a plethora of changes in employment law in the past two years and companies need to be aware of this before taking such drastic action,\" he said. \"Employees now have more rights than ever, regardless of how long they have worked for the company.\" Christine Gowdridge, director of Maternity Alliance, which campaigns for balance between work and childcare, said: \"This case is quite extraordinary because there is a very straightforward legal right to take time off if your child is sick and particularly in an emergency. \"It is quite right that the claim was won and maybe it will publicise this little known right that everyone has to care for a sick dependant, even an elderly relative.\"",

There have been concerns for some time that epilepsy drugs could harm the foetus, but scientists have found it difficult to assess whether any damage is caused by the medication, the disease itself or other factors. A study of 721 women with epilepsy carried out by researchers at the university department of neurology in Liverpool has now pointed the finger at the drug valproate which has been prescribed in the UK for 25 years. Writing in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, David Chadwick and colleagues said their findings suggest use of the drug in pregnancy \"carries particular risks for the development of children exposed in utero\". The findings have serious implications for women with epilepsy of childbearing age, who make up a third of all those taking anti-epileptic medicines. One in 250 pregnant women is estimated to be on anti-epilepsy medication. Hardly any of the 721 women who took part in a survey had changed the epilepsy drugs they were on during pregnancy, indicating that neither they nor their GPs were aware that their baby may be at risk of impaired brain development. The scientists asked the women, who were all registered with the Mersey regional epilepsy clinic, about their medication and about the educational development of their children. Children whose mothers had taken anti-epilepsy drugs while pregnant were 50% more likely than others to have additional educational needs, including extra help in mainstream schools or attendance at a special school. The numbers were particularly significant among women who had taken valproate alone. Their children had a threefold increased risk of additional needs. Those who had taken a combination which included valproate had over twice the risk. The authors point out that over 90% of pregnancies among women with epilepsy are problem free.

This legislation will ensure that these patients are followed up with tight supervision and, if they do not comply with their treatment, that risk will be minimised.\" Mind Chief executive Judi Clements said the charity was \"delighted\" that the government had listened to its concerns about compulsory treatment, and accepted the need for specialist independent advocates for psychiatric patients. She added: \"It is, however, deeply disappointing to see the government waste the best opportunity for decades to 'shore up the gaps' in mental health services by giving people the right to a psychiatric assessment, and a right to get the mental health services they need.\" NHS Confederation NHS Confederation chief executive Stephen Thornton said: \"The proposals for dangerous severe personality disorder must be based on rigorous definitions of dangerous severe personality disorder and treatability. \"They must also be acceptable within the constraints imposed by the European convention on human rights and the Human Rights Act 1998. At present mental health services have no reliable evidence on which to make the link between the severity of personality disorder and dangerousness.\" Kings Fund Angela Greatley, fellow in mental health at the Kings Fund, said the government needed to make sufficient resources available to implement its white paper, and called on ministers to publish an estimated of how much the reforms would cost. She added that there were concerns over compulsory treatment. \"The minister's statement does not allay our concerns over these aspects of the proposed new act, especially when people are to be treated on a compulsory basis in the community.\" Mental Health Foundation Nigel Duerdoth, director of programmes at the foundation, said the white paper plans to introduce compulsory treatment in the community were \"unworkable and impracticable, as well as against the spirit of human rights\". He added that the compulsory powers element was likely to damage the relationships between mental health users and staff. Mental After Care Association (MACA) Gil Hitchon, MACA chief executive, said she doubted whether the compulsory community treatment orders would be effective - and might even make things worse. \"More compulsory powers could harm the vital relationship of trust between users of services and care professionals, and drive people away from services, thereby increasing risk of harm to themselves or others.\"",

It now wants the club to serve the wider community of football fans.\" Since becoming FA chief executive in January, Mr Crozier, former Saatchi &amp; Saatchi joint chief executive, has tried to shake off the organisation's staid image. In October he appointed the organisation's first marketing director, Paul Barber, and hired three senior sports marketeers to restructure its marketing department. Last month he moved the FA from its traditional home in Lancaster Gate in west London into modern offices in Soho Square, near the heart of the advertising industry. Mr Crozier believes the FA's top properties are the England international team and the FA Cup. It believes they can help football's governing body generate a tenfold increase in revenues.",

Mr Cohen stressed that the board of Beenz had not yet decided which markets would be affected, but that a decision would be made by March.

Yet the topic wasn't quite as silly as it sounded.

I felt we needed Dr David Starkey to shriek at us what idiots we are.</p> <p>But first they debated another intractable moral question.

Yet the topic wasn't quite as silly as it sounded. What they were really discussing was whether heavenly beings had physical substance, and in the context of the time it made sense. But those theologians were like two blokes arguing the merits of Owen and Heskey over pints of Boddingtons compared to the House of Commons yesterday. The main debate was about stem cell research on embryos, one of those intractable moral questions which arouse terrific passions. I felt we needed Dr David Starkey to shriek at us what idiots we are. But first they debated another intractable moral question. This was their new \"deferred divisions\", which are votes on minor issues. Instead of trooping wearily through the lobbies, MPs just bung a cross on a piece of paper and the clerks tot them up. It saves a lot of time. But last week no fewer than 80 voted both \"aye\" and \"no\" on the same question. Not surprisingly, the Speaker ruled their papers out. The MPs who'd voted twice complained.

A deal was reached last Friday following protracted talks between lawyers for the parents and the Metropolitan Police Authority. It ends the gruelling seven-year battle Doreen and Neville Lawrence have fought with the Met. Under the terms of the \"full and final\" settlement, the service has not admitted it was negligent in its handling of the inquiry or in the way its officers treated Stephen's parents. Police hope that the case will not set a legal precedent allowing others to sue for alleged negligence. Scotland Yard, however, said the ex-gratia sum was recognition of the \"unique circumstances\" of the case, and the \"strength and determination\" of the Lawrences, who have campaigned tirelessly since their 18-year-old son was stabbed in Eltham, south London, by a group of white youths on April 22 1993. A police statement added: \"Public apologies have been made to Mr and Mrs Lawrence for the failings of the Metropolitan Police Service.\" The \u00a3320,000 figure was agreed after the Lawrences refused an offer of \u00a3250,000 in the autumn, and follows pressure from Ken Livingstone, the mayor of London, who urged a swift resolution to the claim. The Lawrences decided to launch a civil action against the Met after Sir William Macpherson's report into the the investigation, published in February 1999, which concluded that it had been mishandled by the force. They issued writs against 41 officers, including the then commissioner Sir Paul Condon, using the race relations act as the backbone of the claim. They demanded more than \u00a3500,000 compensation for \"alleged negligence, and or conspiracy, and or misfeasance in public office and or breach of statutory duties\". In statements to the high court, they claimed for psychological damage, the cost of their son's funeral in Jamaica, and the cost of the campaign to achieve justice for Stephen. Mrs Lawrence, 47, also asked for money to pay for trips she took to America and South Africa to try to get over the murder and the cost of taxi fares to take her son Stuart to his part-time job.

Motorists who kill and those who repeat offences will face tougher penalties, with longer driving bans for very drunk drivers. The package - the outcome of a review of penalties for the 9.5m motoring offences committed every year in Britain - is designed to help reduce the annual 3,400 death toll on the roads by 40% within 10 years. Motoring organisations last night welcomed the measures, particularly the emphasis on driver improvement and alcohol rehabilitation, as well as increased penalties for the most serious offences. Ministers are also proposing to shake up the points system with the introduction of a more punitive \"second tier\" of points for those who drive at excessive speeds, particularly in built-up areas, and extended driving bans.

The package also includes proposals for longer sentences for the most serious driving offences, including a minimum three year ban (instead of two) for death by dangerous driving, and imposing a lifetime ban on those with previous serious convictions.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Tony Blair says he wants the European Union to be a \"superpower\" and to that end member states are planning a joint rapid reaction force capable of operating autonomously. But one key area of cooperation is rarely mentioned - a common intelligence policy, the ties that would really bind, the ultimate test of mutual trust.</p> <p>Intelligence is an essential tool of military policy-making. As Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform puts it: \"the projected security and defence policy will be handicapped unless there is a high degree of intelligence-sharing among EU governments\". The International Institute for Strategic Studies concludes that \"the pledge to conduct EU-led military operations necessitates an integrated European intelligence architecture\".</p> <p>But this call strikes at the heart of the UK's special relationship with the United States, and it is nowhere more special than in the field of intelligence - military, political, diplomatic and economic. GCHQ, the government's eavesdropping centre, has a symbiotic relationship with its American big brother, the US National Security Agency. The Americans give more than Britain gives in return. However, an internal GCHQ staff manual notes that the agency's contribution to the relationship must be \"of sufficient scale and of the right kind to make a continuation of the Sigint [signals intelligence] alliance worthwhile to our partners\". It adds: \"This may entail on occasion the applying of UK resources to the meeting of US requirements.\"</p> <p>The alliance is spelled out in a secret UK-US treaty signed in 1948 to provide for privileged sharing of signals intelligence between the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. This Anglo-Saxon club and its worldwide surveillance network, code-named Echelon, makes the French suspicious. Yet the NSA has given France technological help with its (more limited) network of listening stations, dubbed \"Frenchelon\".</p> <p>The US wants to preserve its pre-eminent position in satellite imagery and, according to the IISS, it is insisting on the legal right to execute unilateral \"shutter control\" to block the gathering of images Washington regards as affecting its security interests.</p> <p>Even the UK cannot rely on the US. While France gave the UK key intelligence during the Falklands war, Washington, seeking a diplomatic solution, held back. And in an episode which left Whitehall officials trembling with shock, Washington stopped passing relevant intelligence to London in December 1994, when the senate voted to lift the UN arms blockade against ex-Yugoslavia.</p> <p>Two years later President Clinton launched a salvo of cruise missiles against Iraq after Saddam Hussein moved into the northern Kurdish area of the country. France said imagery from its Helios satellite showed the troop movements to be insignificant and refused to support the strikes. The Americans insisted the French were wrong and their satellite was not as good as the US.</p> <p>Spy satellites are expensive. British intelligence officials ask why they should start paying for European satellites when they can get more accurate imagery from the US for free. France argues that Europe will not be able to have an independent foreign policy so long as it is dependent on the Americans for satellite intelligence.</p> <p>France is the only European country with its own delivery system - the Ariane base in French Guyana - capable of putting satellites into space. Spain and Italy have contributed to the French-sponsored Helios satellite programme. Germany, as the chart illustrates, is developing a high-resolution satellite in response to American reluctance to share intelligence during the Kosovo war. Intelligence from Helios and SARLupe will be shared among EU partners.</p> <p>There is also the unsung work carried out by the Western European Union (WEU), now to be subsumed into the EU. The WEU provided valuable intelligence on Kosovo. Its satellite centre at Torrej\u00f3n in northern Spain is unique in providing collective - supranational - intelligence assessments. Satellites are not only vital in giving up-to-date military intelligence for EU troops on the ground. They provide decision-makers with early warnings, crucial to the EU's future role as crisis preventer and manager.</p> <p>But satellites are not the only intelligence tool and the military not the only customer. The security and intelligence agencies of EU member states increasingly exchange material obtained from informers, terrestrial surveillance, or electronic eavesdropping - on terrorists, drug-traffickers, money-launderers and on immigration. The Schengen Information System, the centre of the EU's internal security network, already holds over 9m files, 1.3m of them on individuals. Many of the EU's perceived threats, notably terrorism, are also regarded as priorities for action by the Americans and Russians as well as candidates for EU membership in central and eastern Europe.</p> <p>Charles Grant proposes a European intelligence committee to provide collective assessments based on information from satellites and sanitised intelligence provided by national capitals.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair says he wants the European Union to be a \"superpower\" and to that end member states are planning a joint rapid reaction force capable of operating autonomously. But one key area of cooperation is rarely mentioned - a common intelligence policy, the ties that would really bind, the ultimate test of mutual trust. Intelligence is an essential tool of military policy-making. As Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform puts it: \"the projected security and defence policy will be handicapped unless there is a high degree of intelligence-sharing among EU governments\". The International Institute for Strategic Studies concludes that \"the pledge to conduct EU-led military operations necessitates an integrated European intelligence architecture\". But this call strikes at the heart of the UK's special relationship with the United States, and it is nowhere more special than in the field of intelligence - military, political, diplomatic and economic. GCHQ, the government's eavesdropping centre, has a symbiotic relationship with its American big brother, the US National Security Agency. The Americans give more than Britain gives in return. However, an internal GCHQ staff manual notes that the agency's contribution to the relationship must be \"of sufficient scale and of the right kind to make a continuation of the Sigint [signals intelligence] alliance worthwhile to our partners\". It adds: \"This may entail on occasion the applying of UK resources to the meeting of US requirements.\" The alliance is spelled out in a secret UK-US treaty signed in 1948 to provide for privileged sharing of signals intelligence between the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. This Anglo-Saxon club and its worldwide surveillance network, code-named Echelon, makes the French suspicious. Yet the NSA has given France technological help with its (more limited) network of listening stations, dubbed \"Frenchelon\". The US wants to preserve its pre-eminent position in satellite imagery and, according to the IISS, it is insisting on the legal right to execute unilateral \"shutter control\" to block the gathering of images Washington regards as affecting its security interests. Even the UK cannot rely on the US. While France gave the UK key intelligence during the Falklands war, Washington, seeking a diplomatic solution, held back. And in an episode which left Whitehall officials trembling with shock, Washington stopped passing relevant intelligence to London in December 1994, when the senate voted to lift the UN arms blockade against ex-Yugoslavia. Two years later President Clinton launched a salvo of cruise missiles against Iraq after Saddam Hussein moved into the northern Kurdish area of the country. France said imagery from its Helios satellite showed the troop movements to be insignificant and refused to support the strikes. The Americans insisted the French were wrong and their satellite was not as good as the US. Spy satellites are expensive. British intelligence officials ask why they should start paying for European satellites when they can get more accurate imagery from the US for free. France argues that Europe will not be able to have an independent foreign policy so long as it is dependent on the Americans for satellite intelligence. France is the only European country with its own delivery system - the Ariane base in French Guyana - capable of putting satellites into space. Spain and Italy have contributed to the French-sponsored Helios satellite programme. Germany, as the chart illustrates, is developing a high-resolution satellite in response to American reluctance to share intelligence during the Kosovo war. Intelligence from Helios and SARLupe will be shared among EU partners. There is also the unsung work carried out by the Western European Union (WEU), now to be subsumed into the EU. The WEU provided valuable intelligence on Kosovo. Its satellite centre at Torrej\u00f3n in northern Spain is unique in providing collective - supranational - intelligence assessments. Satellites are not only vital in giving up-to-date military intelligence for EU troops on the ground. They provide decision-makers with early warnings, crucial to the EU's future role as crisis preventer and manager. But satellites are not the only intelligence tool and the military not the only customer. The security and intelligence agencies of EU member states increasingly exchange material obtained from informers, terrestrial surveillance, or electronic eavesdropping - on terrorists, drug-traffickers, money-launderers and on immigration. The Schengen Information System, the centre of the EU's internal security network, already holds over 9m files, 1.3m of them on individuals. Many of the EU's perceived threats, notably terrorism, are also regarded as priorities for action by the Americans and Russians as well as candidates for EU membership in central and eastern Europe. Charles Grant proposes a European intelligence committee to provide collective assessments based on information from satellites and sanitised intelligence provided by national capitals. Emphasise sanitised: Nato member states, let alone EU governments, do not trust each other sufficiently to provide raw intelligence, and probably never will. Yet intelligence cooperation depends on mutual trust. For the foreseeable future, it will also depend, at least in the military field, on the attitude of the Americans, whose technology is far ahead of the Europeans. Washington demonstrated its attitude by agreeing to share stealth technology with the UK on condition it is not passed on to the French. But maybe it will begin to realise, as it demands \"burden sharing\", that a European intelligence capability is as important as military equipment and properly-trained soldiers. Intelligence is now firmly on the EU's agenda. \u0095 Richard Norton-Taylor is the Guardian's security affairs editor richard.norton-taylor@ theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>The most remarkable aspect of William Hague's ill-judged outburst against the Macpherson report was his complete obliteration of what happened to Stephen Lawrence, what happened to the Lawrence family in their struggle for justice and finally what happened to the police who failed so abysmally to prosecute the killers. (Nothing). Hague has wiped out all three shameful events and replaced them with the charge that the Labour-instigated Macpherson report is instead the chief culprit.</p> <p>Macpherson, claims Hague, undermined police morale and law and order on the streets: accused of institutional racism, police fled the service, new recruits were hard to attract. The government admits Macpherson dealt a severe shock to the police. The truth hurt, but it was necessary and accepted by senior police officers. Police numbers, they say, are no longer declining. However Macpherson has entered Tory demonology as another liberal cause of crime.</p> <p>Undeterred, the government yesterday moved to implement one of Macpherson's most important recommendations. A new genuinely Independent Police Complaints Commission will be in place by 2003. As campaigned for vigorously by Liberty and Inquest (and the Guardian), over the last 20 years, the police will no longer investigate themselves in serious cases. This is what Macpherson said: \"Since PCA inquiries, certainly in major cases, are conducted with or through other police forces, the perception is that such investigations of police by police may not be seen to result in independent and fair scrutiny and that justice is not seen to be done\". Now at last it will be. No doubt the Tories will see this as yet another unwarranted assault upon the good name of the police, so it is worth recording some of the most serious recent cases.</p> <p>Since 1990 there have been 548 deaths in police custody. Liberty and Inquest know of no police officer who has ever been prosecuted let alone jailed in relation to any of these events. All of them were investigated by the police themselves. These cases have taken years of dilatory investigation, ending with no police officers in court. Often officers slip off to early retirement on full pensions, signing themselves out with \"stress\" or \"disability\" before disciplinary action can be taken. Macpherson reported that at least five officers would have faced disciplinary charges, \"but such charges could not be pursued because the officers had retired\". He recommended new terms of employment to allow disciplinary proceedings to be brought after retirement, something that still waits to be done.</p> <p>The many shocking cases that prompted this reform include that of Shiji Lapite. He was stopped by police for \"acting suspiciously\" and subsequently died from asphyxia as a result of a neckhold. The inquest jury was told that while caught in a fatal neckhold, one officer bit Lapite in the chest and another twice kicked him in the head as hard as he could. Lapite suffered 36 separate injuries, his voice box fractured during strangulation. Yet despite an inquest's verdict of \"unlawful killing\" there was no prosecution of any of the officers. The man's family took the case up to judicial review, where both the PCA and the crown prosecutor admitted their decision in the case had been \"flawed\". After that an inquiry into the CPS's handling of police cases ordered all serious police cases to be sent to a central unit - yet still no prosecutions have ever followed.</p> <p>The files of Liberty and Inquest are packed with such cases: some become famous such as Harry Stanley - the man shot dead for carrying a table leg in a bag - others just add to the statistics of those dead in prison or in police cells, often restrained by six or eight officers, often killed by lethal neckholds - but no one ever to blame. The reason they become famous cases is because they drag on forever, with no just or satisfactory resolution, leaving families in a constant state of public protest.</p> <p>Dealing day in and day out with the mad, bad and violent inevitably causes some police officers to fly out of control. All police forces will have some dangerous officers or just some very frightened ones. What matters most is how bad cases are handled - transparently, fairly and fast. It matters for the reputation of the police, as well as for the victims. The idea that letting daylight into the police, as Macpherson did, somehow undermines them, lowers their morale or lessens their authority is the exact opposite of the truth. The better they deal with their own miscreants, the more they will be trusted and the more support they will get back from the communities they police. Often complainants just want an explanation and an apology - too rarely given.</p> <p>Dealing well with complaints (there is a huge disparity between best and worst police forces), will presumably be dismissed by Hague as more of that \"paper-work\" that keeps bobbies off the beat. But \"paper-work\" is often what keeps bobbies on the beat. Managerial efficiency includes keeping a stern eye on absenteeism. The Met have cut their sickness rates from an average of 14 days per officer a year in 1996-7 down to only nine days a year last year. That saving is equivalent to an extra 500 officers on the beat.</p> <p>As the election approaches, Labour is worrying about how to get across the fact that crime has fallen, not risen as people always imagine. Polls show people think their own neighbourhood is safer than it was, but they still think crime \"out there\" is rising. Hardly surprising since everything they see and read tells them it must be so, local and national press as ever full of crime horrors, Crime Watch pumping it out every week, crime drama making violence seem to lurk everywhere. So far Labour has tried to seize popular support with strings of new laws, more crackdowns, more quick fixes. Child curfews and the like have little measurable effect on crime, but it all helps inflame fear of crime, now rebounding on Labour.</p> <p>Jack Straw and Tony Blair have used law and order as a cheap vote-getter every bit as cynically as the Tories. It is the issue, after all, that created and defined New Labour.

      "bodyText": "The most remarkable aspect of William Hague's ill-judged outburst against the Macpherson report was his complete obliteration of what happened to Stephen Lawrence, what happened to the Lawrence family in their struggle for justice and finally what happened to the police who failed so abysmally to prosecute the killers. (Nothing). Hague has wiped out all three shameful events and replaced them with the charge that the Labour-instigated Macpherson report is instead the chief culprit. Macpherson, claims Hague, undermined police morale and law and order on the streets: accused of institutional racism, police fled the service, new recruits were hard to attract. The government admits Macpherson dealt a severe shock to the police. The truth hurt, but it was necessary and accepted by senior police officers. Police numbers, they say, are no longer declining. However Macpherson has entered Tory demonology as another liberal cause of crime. Undeterred, the government yesterday moved to implement one of Macpherson's most important recommendations. A new genuinely Independent Police Complaints Commission will be in place by 2003. As campaigned for vigorously by Liberty and Inquest (and the Guardian), over the last 20 years, the police will no longer investigate themselves in serious cases. This is what Macpherson said: \"Since PCA inquiries, certainly in major cases, are conducted with or through other police forces, the perception is that such investigations of police by police may not be seen to result in independent and fair scrutiny and that justice is not seen to be done\". Now at last it will be. No doubt the Tories will see this as yet another unwarranted assault upon the good name of the police, so it is worth recording some of the most serious recent cases. Since 1990 there have been 548 deaths in police custody. Liberty and Inquest know of no police officer who has ever been prosecuted let alone jailed in relation to any of these events. All of them were investigated by the police themselves. These cases have taken years of dilatory investigation, ending with no police officers in court. Often officers slip off to early retirement on full pensions, signing themselves out with \"stress\" or \"disability\" before disciplinary action can be taken. Macpherson reported that at least five officers would have faced disciplinary charges, \"but such charges could not be pursued because the officers had retired\". He recommended new terms of employment to allow disciplinary proceedings to be brought after retirement, something that still waits to be done. The many shocking cases that prompted this reform include that of Shiji Lapite. He was stopped by police for \"acting suspiciously\" and subsequently died from asphyxia as a result of a neckhold. The inquest jury was told that while caught in a fatal neckhold, one officer bit Lapite in the chest and another twice kicked him in the head as hard as he could. Lapite suffered 36 separate injuries, his voice box fractured during strangulation. Yet despite an inquest's verdict of \"unlawful killing\" there was no prosecution of any of the officers. The man's family took the case up to judicial review, where both the PCA and the crown prosecutor admitted their decision in the case had been \"flawed\". After that an inquiry into the CPS's handling of police cases ordered all serious police cases to be sent to a central unit - yet still no prosecutions have ever followed. The files of Liberty and Inquest are packed with such cases: some become famous such as Harry Stanley - the man shot dead for carrying a table leg in a bag - others just add to the statistics of those dead in prison or in police cells, often restrained by six or eight officers, often killed by lethal neckholds - but no one ever to blame. The reason they become famous cases is because they drag on forever, with no just or satisfactory resolution, leaving families in a constant state of public protest. Dealing day in and day out with the mad, bad and violent inevitably causes some police officers to fly out of control. All police forces will have some dangerous officers or just some very frightened ones. What matters most is how bad cases are handled - transparently, fairly and fast. It matters for the reputation of the police, as well as for the victims. The idea that letting daylight into the police, as Macpherson did, somehow undermines them, lowers their morale or lessens their authority is the exact opposite of the truth. The better they deal with their own miscreants, the more they will be trusted and the more support they will get back from the communities they police. Often complainants just want an explanation and an apology - too rarely given. Dealing well with complaints (there is a huge disparity between best and worst police forces), will presumably be dismissed by Hague as more of that \"paper-work\" that keeps bobbies off the beat. But \"paper-work\" is often what keeps bobbies on the beat. Managerial efficiency includes keeping a stern eye on absenteeism. The Met have cut their sickness rates from an average of 14 days per officer a year in 1996-7 down to only nine days a year last year. That saving is equivalent to an extra 500 officers on the beat. As the election approaches, Labour is worrying about how to get across the fact that crime has fallen, not risen as people always imagine. Polls show people think their own neighbourhood is safer than it was, but they still think crime \"out there\" is rising. Hardly surprising since everything they see and read tells them it must be so, local and national press as ever full of crime horrors, Crime Watch pumping it out every week, crime drama making violence seem to lurk everywhere. So far Labour has tried to seize popular support with strings of new laws, more crackdowns, more quick fixes. Child curfews and the like have little measurable effect on crime, but it all helps inflame fear of crime, now rebounding on Labour. Jack Straw and Tony Blair have used law and order as a cheap vote-getter every bit as cynically as the Tories. It is the issue, after all, that created and defined New Labour. That killer leaked prime ministerial memo said it all: \"The government needs something tough with immediate bite which sends a message through the system. Maybe, the driving licence penalty for young offenders. But this should be done soon and I personally should be associated with it.\" Those five short sharp law-and-order and fraud measures in the pre-election Queen's speech show Labour just as eager to use and abuse fear of crime for its own political ends.

All symbolism and no substance\".</p> <p>He understood that the debate in Europe about ending employment discrimination on grounds of age and disability was motivated by good intentions and for entirely laudable aims. However, he added: \"If left unchecked, the impact would have had a detrimental effect on the forces by insisting that disabled people had a right to serve. We need to guard against such ill-conceived ideas in future but the fact that some thought they should apply to the forces is a reflection of that lack of awareness of military issues\".</p> <p>In a swipe at the \"litigious nation\" Britain was becoming, Sir Charles expressed surprise that policemen involved in the Hillsborough football disaster were awarded compensation for the horrors they had to cope with.</p> <p>\"I don't doubt the very real problems that can give rise to post traumatic stress disorder,\" he told the Royal United Services Institute.</p> <p>He added: \"But what really concerns me about the creeping advance of litigation is that it will breed a cautious group of leaders who may step back from courageous decisions for fear that they will be pursued through the courts if it all goes wrong.</p> <p>\"Could we one day see a subaltern being sued by his platoon for making a decision, perhaps in the heat of battle, which subsequently turns out to have been misjudged and resulting in death or injury?</p> <p>\"There is a culture of risk aversion developing in society which is anathema to servicemen. We are not foolhardy but our profession requires a degree of decisiveness, flair and courage which sits badly with some of the more restrictive practices of modern employment legislation.\"</p> <p>He made it clear he was strongly opposed to women fighting alongside men on the front line.

      "bodyText": "General Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of the defence staff, delivered in a speech last night a sweeping attack on what he called a culture of \"risk aversion\", warning of the prospect of young officers being sued by their platoons for leading men into action which could lead to death or injury. He said: \"If we hamstring our fighting services with inadequate funding, poor equipment, undermanning and inappropriate legislation then we will create a generation of sailors, soldiers and airmen who are little more than a gendarmerie. All symbolism and no substance\". He understood that the debate in Europe about ending employment discrimination on grounds of age and disability was motivated by good intentions and for entirely laudable aims. However, he added: \"If left unchecked, the impact would have had a detrimental effect on the forces by insisting that disabled people had a right to serve. We need to guard against such ill-conceived ideas in future but the fact that some thought they should apply to the forces is a reflection of that lack of awareness of military issues\". In a swipe at the \"litigious nation\" Britain was becoming, Sir Charles expressed surprise that policemen involved in the Hillsborough football disaster were awarded compensation for the horrors they had to cope with. \"I don't doubt the very real problems that can give rise to post traumatic stress disorder,\" he told the Royal United Services Institute. He added: \"But what really concerns me about the creeping advance of litigation is that it will breed a cautious group of leaders who may step back from courageous decisions for fear that they will be pursued through the courts if it all goes wrong. \"Could we one day see a subaltern being sued by his platoon for making a decision, perhaps in the heat of battle, which subsequently turns out to have been misjudged and resulting in death or injury? \"There is a culture of risk aversion developing in society which is anathema to servicemen. We are not foolhardy but our profession requires a degree of decisiveness, flair and courage which sits badly with some of the more restrictive practices of modern employment legislation.\" He made it clear he was strongly opposed to women fighting alongside men on the front line. Referring to a Ministry of Defence inquiry into their suitability for close combat roles, he said: \"From my perspective we must ensure that nothing, I repeat nothing, damages the combat effectiveness of the British armed forces.\" Sir Charles described the shortages of forces personnel - notably of RAF fast jet pilots - as \"critical\", given the worldwide operational tasks demanded of them. The shortage of 8,000 personnel in the army was now unlikely to be made good before 2008, he said. One of the problems, he said, was that defence since the end of the cold war had been a \"shrinking business\". In a swipe at the Treasury but praising the speed with which the armed forces had responded rapidly to the Sierra Leone crisis, he said: \"We cannot keep on doing more and more for less and less. No one can expect us to keep this up\". \u0095 The government was yesterday accused of insulting \"some of the bravest men who ever fought for this country\" over leaving Gurkhas out of a \u00a310,000 a head compensation package for former PoWs held in Japanese camps in the second world war.

The company, Euromin, faces a corporate manslaughter charge. The move follows a ruling by two high court judges in March that an earlier decision by the director of public prosecutions, David Calvert-Smith, and the crown prosecution service, not to prosecute Euromin or its general manager, was \"irrational\" and should be reconsidered \"with despatch\". Mr Calvert-Smith said yesterday that he had examined the evidence and decided that there was \"sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction\" and that it was \"in the public interest to prosecute\".

      "bodyText": "A doting father who believed he was Jesus Christ plunged a 14in carving knife into his sleeping daughter's heart in the belief she would come back to life after the attack, a jury heard yesterday. A Swansea crown court jury took five minutes to find Phillip Andrew Hall, 41, not guilty by reason of insanity of the murder of his daughter Emma, 12, last June . The judge, Mr Justice McKinnan, said the verdict allowed him to order that Hall, from Catbrook, Monmouthshire, was locked away in a secure psychiatric hospital without limit of time. In the meantime, he ordered that Hall be sent to Caswell Clinic, near Bridgend, pending a decision on which hospital he should be sent to long term. Earlier, the jury had been told that Hall believed he had to kill his own family and commit suicide to save 15 other families from death. Psychiatrists testified that Hall had been diagnosed as a chronic paranoid schizophrenic who suffered from profound delusions. Neil Bidder, for the prosecution, said Hall had a history of mental problems. But a series of hoax emails from a rival company led to him taking a bogus trip to India and might have been the catalyst for the tragedy. The trip took place while Hall, a marketing manager, was working for a new firm called Molecular Light Technology in June. The jury heard that Hall had been trained to demonstrate an experiment to the Indian clients. He became convinced that 15 full tubes that he had to take with him represented 15 Christian families which were facing death. A 16th empty tube represented his family which he would have to kill to save the others, he told psychiatrists He planned to kill Emma, son James, 10, and his wife, Karen, before committing suicide. The court heard that Hall had studied animal physiology and nutrition and enjoyed a successful career working for several multinational firms. Hall's first signs of delusional behaviour, it was told, began when he went to America briefly to work in 1992. He later claimed he had made a profound discovery - that he was Jesus Christ. He still managed to rise in his career despite spending time in psychiatric hospitals. After the trial, a statement issued by the Hall family said: \"Andy was the victim of a cruel hoax perpetrated apparently for business reasons by others. \"The hoax acted as a catalyst for this tragedy and had it not been carried out it seems likely that the awful consequences to the Hall family would not have happened. \"This is a tragedy in the truest sense.\"",

Perhaps most worryingly, she did not deny that she gives children fishfingers as Christmas presents. I admit I was going out on a limb with that one and couldn't have backed it up if challenged, but it seems to be a gamble that paid off, because we must assume it's true.</p> <p>In fact, she did not deny that the Asylum Support Regulations published this year define toys as not being an \"essential living need\", which means that the level of support for refugees was calculated expressly to exclude the possibility of their buying toys. Since those were the government's words, Ms Roche is hard-pressed to shake them off, although bolder ministers would try. I believe the correct thing for politicians to say about something like that is: \"We were trying to start a debate\". Instead, Ms Roche tells us that refugees \"can use their vouchers in 23,500 retail outlets on anything they want\". I suppose that's true; they could buy the kid a pony if they starved her for a year and Asda had one in stock.</p> <p>It is hard to develop a clear picture of exactly what's happening nationwide, because the asylum support system is in chaos. Which shops are designated to take vouchers varies from place to place, and the items that shops will exchange for them vary even more. With refugees dispersed to all kinds of remote places, there is no guarantee that they can spend their vouchers anywhere nearby at all. The ones in prison get no vouchers but full board and free racial abuse.</p> <p>The main point about vouchers is that their function is to humiliate vulnerable people and make them identifiable in communities that might already be reluctant to accept them. The only people who benefit from the scheme are the far right, the supermarkets, the Sodexho corporation which prints the vouchers, and the government, which gets to demonstrate that it is tough on toys and tough on the causes of toys. If, as Ms Roche suggests, the level of support is similar to that provided to other welfare claimants, the scheme is more expensive than paying cash.</p> <p>In fact, when Ms Roche says that the support given by NASS is \"broadly equivalent to income support levels\", she is right only to the extent that it's less. It is true that, although the value of vouchers is much lower than income support, refugees get a few other bits and bobs that partly close the gap. When everything is added up, refugees get about 80% of income support, quite a bit less than not very much. Moreover, \"free furnished accommodation\" is a grandiose way of describing the holes into which asylum seekers and other welfare claimants are dumped. In fact, most of the places laughably called \"hotels\" have got some furniture in them. Refugees are not disporting themselves on the finest chaises longues while single mums in the same B&amp;B sit enviously on metal spikes. In many cases, the accommodation on offer is much the same, but again, systems vary around the country, and landlords are a law unto themselves.</p> <p>The dispersal system itself is pure harassment. Recently, a refugee was sent from the Tees Valley to Leicester, away from his best friend and only known contact in the UK, on the pretext that there was no single male accommodation available. The same day, a man in Leicester was dispersed to the Tees Valley.</p> <p>But, in any case, is not Gordon Brown furious that, while he talks up his munificence, the Home Office brags that all welfare claimants live miserably, not just asylum seekers? In April, Jack Straw reassured the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture that, for all those on welfare, \"there is equally no special provision made for toys\". Well, praise be.</p> <p>There is a strong case for saying that displaced people with traumatised children and no extended family around them are even more in need than are other deprived families. The Medical Foundation has cited the particular therapeutic effects of play for refugee children. But the fact that we should even be weighing up the perks of being different kinds of pauper is a woeful indictment of government.

      "body": "<p>Randolph Apperson Hearst, who has died aged 85, was the one of the five sons of William Randolph Hearst who looked after the business side of his family's vast American newspaper, magazine and broadcasting empire. Quiet and fabulously wealthy, he was catapulted into most unwanted notoriety when his daughter, Patty, was kidnapped in February 1974 by a group of black militants calling themselves the Symbionese Liberation Army.</p> <p>In a classic example of what has been become known as the Stockholm syndrome, Patty Hearst seemed to have been converted by her captors, and went with them on a bank raid. She was caught by closed circuit television cameras holding a weapon, and subsequently sentenced to seven years in prison, of which she served just less than two years.</p> <p>At her trial she denied that she had embraced her kidnappers' revolutionary hostility to capitalism. Her father, who, with his wife, had faithfully attended the trial, conspicuous in his sober business suits, surprised many by refusing to condemn his daughter and trying to understand her feelings about the experience.</p> <p>Randolph Hearst's father, William Randolph Hearst Sr, was himself the son of a rich mining investor with major holdings in the Comstock silver lode in Nevada, the Anaconda copper mine in Montana and rich goldmines in California. The father was flamboyant. He was famous for reproving the western artist, Frederick Remington, hired to cover the Spanish-American war in Cuba but unable to find any fighting to paint, with the words: \"You provide the pictures, Mr Remington; I'll provide the war.\"</p> <p>The founding father won the San Francisco Examiner in a poker game and gave it as a present to his son, William Randolph Hearst, then a student at Harvard. Hearst Sr, brilliantly caricatured by Orson Welles and Herman Mankiewicz in the film Citizen Kane, built up a chain of rightwing newspapers and other media properties across America.</p> <p>When he died in 1951, Will- iam Randolph Hearst de clined to leave the properties to his five sons. Instead, he left them to be managed by accountants and editors, with the sons outnumbered on a 13-man board of trustees.</p> <p>After boarding school at Lawrenceville and Harvard, Randolph worked for various family papers and then served in the air transport command of the United States Army Air Corps, rising to the rank of captain.</p> <p>After the second world war, he worked his way up in the management of the San Francisco Call-Bulletin to become its publisher, shortly before his father's death. He then moved into the corporation management of the Hearst companies, becoming president, director and chief executive of Hearst Publishing and Hearst Consolidated Publication.</p> <p>The family business was losing millions of dollars a year. Randolph Hearst backed managers who pruned away unprofitable elements of the business and restored and increased its profitability.

      "bodyText": "Randolph Apperson Hearst, who has died aged 85, was the one of the five sons of William Randolph Hearst who looked after the business side of his family's vast American newspaper, magazine and broadcasting empire. Quiet and fabulously wealthy, he was catapulted into most unwanted notoriety when his daughter, Patty, was kidnapped in February 1974 by a group of black militants calling themselves the Symbionese Liberation Army. In a classic example of what has been become known as the Stockholm syndrome, Patty Hearst seemed to have been converted by her captors, and went with them on a bank raid. She was caught by closed circuit television cameras holding a weapon, and subsequently sentenced to seven years in prison, of which she served just less than two years. At her trial she denied that she had embraced her kidnappers' revolutionary hostility to capitalism. Her father, who, with his wife, had faithfully attended the trial, conspicuous in his sober business suits, surprised many by refusing to condemn his daughter and trying to understand her feelings about the experience. Randolph Hearst's father, William Randolph Hearst Sr, was himself the son of a rich mining investor with major holdings in the Comstock silver lode in Nevada, the Anaconda copper mine in Montana and rich goldmines in California. The father was flamboyant. He was famous for reproving the western artist, Frederick Remington, hired to cover the Spanish-American war in Cuba but unable to find any fighting to paint, with the words: \"You provide the pictures, Mr Remington; I'll provide the war.\" The founding father won the San Francisco Examiner in a poker game and gave it as a present to his son, William Randolph Hearst, then a student at Harvard. Hearst Sr, brilliantly caricatured by Orson Welles and Herman Mankiewicz in the film Citizen Kane, built up a chain of rightwing newspapers and other media properties across America. When he died in 1951, Will- iam Randolph Hearst de clined to leave the properties to his five sons. Instead, he left them to be managed by accountants and editors, with the sons outnumbered on a 13-man board of trustees. After boarding school at Lawrenceville and Harvard, Randolph worked for various family papers and then served in the air transport command of the United States Army Air Corps, rising to the rank of captain. After the second world war, he worked his way up in the management of the San Francisco Call-Bulletin to become its publisher, shortly before his father's death. He then moved into the corporation management of the Hearst companies, becoming president, director and chief executive of Hearst Publishing and Hearst Consolidated Publication. The family business was losing millions of dollars a year. Randolph Hearst backed managers who pruned away unprofitable elements of the business and restored and increased its profitability. From 1973 to 1996, he was chairman of the family's privately-owned holding company. He also occupied important positions in the Hearst family's charitable foundations. He served on the board of the National Council of Christians and Jews, and was a member of the council of both the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Until 1974, Hearst and his then wife, Catherine Campbell Hearst, led a cheerful and prominent social life in San Francisco, and his personal fortune grew inexorably. The most recent estimate by Forbes magazine put his net worth at $1.8bn, and shortly before his death he bought the 30,000-ft square Vanderbilt mansion in Manaplan, near Palm Beach, Florida. Then the thunderbolt fell. His daughter was abducted from her dormitory at the University of California at Berkeley. Her kidnappers demanded that her parents give millions of dollars to poor people in California, and Hearst started a programme called People In Need, to which he pledged $2m. Eventually, more than 90,000 bags of food were distributed to the poor. For a man of such wealth, who had done so well in business, Hearst was surprisingly shy and retiring. Friends say that he felt he had fallen short of his father's achievement. \"He was a nice man,\" said Frank Bennack Jr, the long-time editor of the San Francisco Examiner. \"Probably too nice for his own good.\" But when the family catastrophe happened, Hearst insisted on being his own media spokesman, and personally took on the burden of rescuing Patty, while trying to understand her motives - and those of her kidnappers. He was, said Larry Kramer, a former Examiner reporter, \"never the same afterwards\". Less than a month ago, the Hearst family sold the Examiner, its first newspaper property, and took over its ancient rival, the San Francisco Chronicle. Hearst's first marriage ended in divorce in 1982. A second marriage, to Maria Cynthia Scruggs, also ended in divorce. He is survived by his third wife, Veronica de Uribe, and his five daughters. \u0095 Randolph Apperson Hearst, newspaper and media executive, born December 2 1915; died December 18 2000",

However, Stiff were only interested in Kirsty, and invited her to record a debut solo single, They Don\u2019t Know; it was released in June 1979, after she had dropped out of art college.

BT wants a test case and presumably, if it is successful, will then go around the world demanding money from every internet developer and service provider in sight. </p> <p>BT's claimed patent over hyper-links dates from research work carried out in the 1970s on the long-forgotten Prestel information service. </p> <p>Most of the patents granted at the time have expired, but the one covering hyper-linking went to appeal in the US and did not come through until 1986. It runs, apparently, to 2006. </p> <p>Now, without getting into an argument about who invented the internet, it seems apposite to point out that this is the same company that on this side of the Atlantic is dragging its feet in allowing British consumers high speed access to the web. </p> <p>Web-related businesses are folding across the country every day, and it seems fair to argue that BT is at least partially to blame. Slow net access is one big reason why consumers have proved slow to consume online. </p> <p>The technology for instant page downloads, watchable video streaming and all the other things which make using the web a pleasant experience has been around for years. </p> <p>But BT has had to be forced to make it available, and even now makes it as difficult and unaffordable as possible - all because it fears its fat margins from handling the bulk of the country's communications will shrink. </p> <p>Maybe a few more people should start suing BT. </p> <p><strong> Water test </strong><br> </p> <p> The message from Ofwat yesterday came over loud and clear. The big water and sewage groups should not regard the regulator's new director-general, Philip Fletcher, as a pushover. </p> <p>During his first few months in the job he has been making sympathetic noises the industry has interpreted as a green light for its more ambitious schemes. </p> <p>Now Anglian Water has walked away from its first real tussle with Mr Fletcher with a bloodied nose. He has rejected Anglian's request for an interim price review, in effect telling the company to pull the other one. </p> <p>The regulatory system is not rigid. Mr Fletcher has agreed to change the price limits for two other companies faced with the same problem - an unexpectedly large number of customers switching from unmetered to metered water supplies. </p> <p>Water companies lose out when customers switch over to a metered supply. They have to install the meters free of charge, and a customer's annual bill usually falls. </p> <p>If the regulator's estimate of the number switching is too low then revenue and profits are hit. </p> <p>Anglian Water has always seen domestic meters as the best way of making the best use of its limited water supplies. But in this case, it appears to have acted prematurely. </p> <p>Severn Trent, the big Midlands water group, also believes that Ofwat has underestimated the likely rush to meters. But it has decided to wait until next year - when it will have concrete figures rather than projections - before taking the issue up with the regulator. </p> <p>It hopes to recover the extra costs during next year. </p> <p>Anglia obviously felt it could not wait so long. The sector has taken a battering since Sir Ian Byatt, the previous regulator, announced tough price controls for the 2000 to 2005 period. </p> <p>Some of the water companies have complained that the particularly sharp price cuts this year have damaged their financial standing, making it harder for them to borrow the money to fund the huge environmental programme ordered by the government. </p> <p>Anglian Water has said it may well take the metering issue to the competition commission for a final ruling. Such a move may make sense in commercial terms, but it would be a public relations disaster. The public perception is that there is too much water about at the moment. It is hardly the time, therefore, for a company to ask for a price increase so it can save the stuff.</p>",

In the US, BT has demanded unspecified royalties from 18 internet services providers and one of these - Prodigy Communications - has found itself on the receiving end of a full-blown lawsuit. BT wants a test case and presumably, if it is successful, will then go around the world demanding money from every internet developer and service provider in sight. BT's claimed patent over hyper-links dates from research work carried out in the 1970s on the long-forgotten Prestel information service. Most of the patents granted at the time have expired, but the one covering hyper-linking went to appeal in the US and did not come through until 1986. It runs, apparently, to 2006. Now, without getting into an argument about who invented the internet, it seems apposite to point out that this is the same company that on this side of the Atlantic is dragging its feet in allowing British consumers high speed access to the web. Web-related businesses are folding across the country every day, and it seems fair to argue that BT is at least partially to blame. Slow net access is one big reason why consumers have proved slow to consume online. The technology for instant page downloads, watchable video streaming and all the other things which make using the web a pleasant experience has been around for years. But BT has had to be forced to make it available, and even now makes it as difficult and unaffordable as possible - all because it fears its fat margins from handling the bulk of the country's communications will shrink. Maybe a few more people should start suing BT. Water test The message from Ofwat yesterday came over loud and clear. The big water and sewage groups should not regard the regulator's new director-general, Philip Fletcher, as a pushover. During his first few months in the job he has been making sympathetic noises the industry has interpreted as a green light for its more ambitious schemes. Now Anglian Water has walked away from its first real tussle with Mr Fletcher with a bloodied nose. He has rejected Anglian's request for an interim price review, in effect telling the company to pull the other one. The regulatory system is not rigid. Mr Fletcher has agreed to change the price limits for two other companies faced with the same problem - an unexpectedly large number of customers switching from unmetered to metered water supplies. Water companies lose out when customers switch over to a metered supply. They have to install the meters free of charge, and a customer's annual bill usually falls. If the regulator's estimate of the number switching is too low then revenue and profits are hit. Anglian Water has always seen domestic meters as the best way of making the best use of its limited water supplies. But in this case, it appears to have acted prematurely. Severn Trent, the big Midlands water group, also believes that Ofwat has underestimated the likely rush to meters. But it has decided to wait until next year - when it will have concrete figures rather than projections - before taking the issue up with the regulator. It hopes to recover the extra costs during next year. Anglia obviously felt it could not wait so long. The sector has taken a battering since Sir Ian Byatt, the previous regulator, announced tough price controls for the 2000 to 2005 period. Some of the water companies have complained that the particularly sharp price cuts this year have damaged their financial standing, making it harder for them to borrow the money to fund the huge environmental programme ordered by the government. Anglian Water has said it may well take the metering issue to the competition commission for a final ruling. Such a move may make sense in commercial terms, but it would be a public relations disaster. The public perception is that there is too much water about at the moment. It is hardly the time, therefore, for a company to ask for a price increase so it can save the stuff.",

Two stunning announcements provided bookends to George W's first official day as president-elect: a warning from Wall Street merger partners JP Morgan and Chase Manhattan started the day, and one from Microsoft - the software group's first in more than 10 years - ended it. Then, as traders were preparing for the weekend, eToys.com, the online toy company which was one of the earliest stars of the dot.com galaxy, announced on Friday night that it was going to run out of cash sooner than expected because of disappointing sales. </p> <p>This week brought further bad news: a warning from media group Time Warner.

The underlying motif for most has been that American consumers and corporations have stopped spending as much as they did during the glory days of the 1990s. </p> <p>One of the reasons the Fed indicated it was softening its anti-inflationary stance was the welter of evidence that the fast-paced US economy has hit a roadblock. </p> <p>However, yesterday President Clinton gave his vote of support in the economy. He said he did not think the president-elect would face a US economy inching toward recession, but a slower growth period of about 2.5%, half the rate of recent years. \"He'll have economic challenges, and you ought to give him a chance to meet with me and not try to figure it all out in advance,\" Mr Clinton said. </p> <p>The rash of profit warnings has pointed to a slowdown in consumer spending.

Along with signs from media companies such as Time Warner that big companies were clamping down on their advertising expenditure, the announcement provided evidence that other forms of corporate spending were decelerating. </p> <p>Some analysts have remained optimistic about next year in spite of all the bad news. Gerald Cohen, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, expects the technology sector to increase earnings on average by 15% next year. In 2000, earnings from hi-tech companies leaped an impressive 32%. Even the S&amp;P 500 members are expected to increase earnings by 8% on average, hardly recessionary levels. </p> <p>Mr Cohen blames the sense of chaos on the sharp slowing of growth in the last half of this year.

An inflatable doll constructed by Dr Phibes, Lolo Ferrari was part wet dream, part nightmare. </p> <p> <strong> Look At Lolo</strong> (Channel 4) was a revealing insight into the life and death of a woman whose insecurities drove her to reconstruct herself as a grotesque parody of the ideal female form.

Her plastic surgeon claimed, barefaced, that her breasts were her happiness, but it was clear that Lolo enjoyed less than a thimbleful of joy in her life. Always on the look out for new opportunities - what else could she be but famous? - Lolo stumbled from porn star to pop star and failed at both. From Eurotrash to plain trash (and there are those who wouldn't see the difference between the two), Lolo's tale was a depressing one of self-loathing, abuse and the malice of men directed at wounded women.

As this excellent, original and imaginative documentary made terribly clear, we could all be tyrants at heart and that isn't something you want to Chim Chim Cher-ee from the rooftops. </p> <p>Employing simple yet frighteningly telling techniques to establish just how tribal, how narrow-minded and prejudiced we can be, Five Steps To Tyranny was both illuminating and unsurprising. Over and over, man's - and woman's - inhumanity to our fellow homo sapiens was underlined, from discussion of the genocide in Rwanda to football fans leaving rivals to writhe in pain on the pavement. Whilst at the time, in 1994, the first prompted comments of \"It couldn't happen here\", the fact that the two instances were placed side by side, effectively illustrated that it could indeed happen here.

Essential viewing, Five Steps To Tyranny was profoundly saddening but compulsive for it. </p> <p>And speaking of atavistic behaviour, caution - and undergarments - were thrown to the wind in a <strong> Brookside</strong> (Channel 4) special as the Manor Park massive hit Liverpool town centre like a tsunami of hormones, Bacardi Breezers and cheap gold chains.

The artistes are the Human League, hit-making giants of the 80s and early 90s, and universally recognised as one of the seminal synthesiser outfits of all time. </p> <p>And the occasion? Well, you won't believe this. Philip Oakey, Susan Sulley and Joanne Catherall are playing my girlfriend's office party. Quite how the act that provided David Bowie with a vision of the future and spawned the pop colossus Dare have ended up at a commercial bank's \"do\" is beyond me. The event is a private affair. The fans aren't supposed to know about this, never mind the Guardian. We have sidled in courtesy of the \"and guest\" bit on the ticket. </p> <p>This seems a considerably scaled-down example of the modern phenomenon whereby the likes of Sting and Elton get millions for playing exclusive gigs for sheikhs. Three microphone stands survey proceedings teasingly from the stage. There are, worryingly, no synthesisers. Thankfully, the DJ - an old skool, Bananarama-playing type - reassures us: \"In 10 minutes! The Human League! Rocking back the 80s!\" Gulp. </p> <p>The League finally appear, in funereal black coats and dark glasses. Surely Sheffield's finest aren't embarrassed to be here? Suddenly, as Sound of the Crowd ends, off come the coats and shades, on go three bemused, ironic grins, and the audience erupts. </p> <p>For eight songs (sung to backing tapes, but really only the audience makes it that different from Madonna at Brixton), men shake Philip Oakey's hand while women fall at his feet - although that might just be the combination of lager and high heels. </p> <p>Oakey's hair has long since left him after the physical abuse it endured in the early 80s, but with the famous League Girls still drop-dead glitzy the trio look better than anyone who's ever shared a bill with Culture Club has a right to. </p> <p>The band stick to their classic hits, but while the tunes are well-worn, the incongruity of the setting brings new vigour. Wonderfully, several people point at Phil and sing the \"This is Phil talking...\" rap with him in Love Action. When Oakey shouts \"We're the Human League, from 30 miles away,\" you can almost imagine the business meeting that began \"How much?! Only up the road?!\" </p> <p>It says everything about the League's dignity that they refrain from changing the lyrics to Don't You Want Me to \"She was working as a bank tell-ah...\" What should have been a sad affair feels like an event, like Vera Duckworth popping into the local boozer. There is something distasteful about legends reducing themselves like this for money, but also something rather fabulous about the unique access these affairs give to normal people. My girlfriend's already compiling a wish list of next year's turns: Kraftwerk, late 70s punk obscurities the Lurkers and the Rolling Stones.</p>",

Quite how the act that provided David Bowie with a vision of the future and spawned the pop colossus Dare have ended up at a commercial bank's \"do\" is beyond me. The event is a private affair. The fans aren't supposed to know about this, never mind the Guardian. We have sidled in courtesy of the \"and guest\" bit on the ticket. This seems a considerably scaled-down example of the modern phenomenon whereby the likes of Sting and Elton get millions for playing exclusive gigs for sheikhs. Three microphone stands survey proceedings teasingly from the stage. There are, worryingly, no synthesisers. Thankfully, the DJ - an old skool, Bananarama-playing type - reassures us: \"In 10 minutes! The Human League! Rocking back the 80s!\" Gulp. The League finally appear, in funereal black coats and dark glasses. Surely Sheffield's finest aren't embarrassed to be here? Suddenly, as Sound of the Crowd ends, off come the coats and shades, on go three bemused, ironic grins, and the audience erupts. For eight songs (sung to backing tapes, but really only the audience makes it that different from Madonna at Brixton), men shake Philip Oakey's hand while women fall at his feet - although that might just be the combination of lager and high heels. Oakey's hair has long since left him after the physical abuse it endured in the early 80s, but with the famous League Girls still drop-dead glitzy the trio look better than anyone who's ever shared a bill with Culture Club has a right to. The band stick to their classic hits, but while the tunes are well-worn, the incongruity of the setting brings new vigour. Wonderfully, several people point at Phil and sing the \"This is Phil talking...\" rap with him in Love Action. When Oakey shouts \"We're the Human League, from 30 miles away,\" you can almost imagine the business meeting that began \"How much?! Only up the road?!\" It says everything about the League's dignity that they refrain from changing the lyrics to Don't You Want Me to \"She was working as a bank tell-ah...\" What should have been a sad affair feels like an event, like Vera Duckworth popping into the local boozer. There is something distasteful about legends reducing themselves like this for money, but also something rather fabulous about the unique access these affairs give to normal people. My girlfriend's already compiling a wish list of next year's turns: Kraftwerk, late 70s punk obscurities the Lurkers and the Rolling Stones.",

      "body": "<p>In the car park of Duke's Wharf, Nottingham, under the sign announcing \"24 Luxury Canal Side Apartments\", you get a good view of the castle looming up in the winter mist, a neoclassical palace perched on a mass of sandstone. This appears to be the identical vista to JMW Turner's watercolour Nottingham, Nottinghamshire. Trouble is, you can't see the canal, which also features in Turner's image - part of his great series of Picturesque Views in England and Wales, for luxury apartments. A figure comes out of the dark, wearing a suit and tie in the icy evening. Would I like to see the show flat? And so a search for Turner's Britain leads to an introduction to riverside living in the 21st century. </p> <p>Hi-tech industries have transformed the economy of Nottingham, explains Daniel, the estate agent, and there's a demand for this kind of inner-city home. Prices start at \u00a3100,000. There's a giant TV in the show flat, white furniture, and the view is just what I was looking for. From the front window you can see the castle like a dream image floating above the city, making you think not just of Turner but of Claude Lorrain, the 17th-century French master he set out to rival, whose paintings are full of fairytale castles. From the back window, you can see the canal, deserted, cleaned up. </p> <p>This is the scene of Turner's golden, shimmering watercolour Nottingham, in which the water reflects the busy life of the city. Tonight it reflects the new national headquarters of the Inland Revenue on the far shore - another reason the city needs executive housing, explains Daniel. \"And there's our Millennium Dome,\" he says, referring to a white, tent-like structure that houses leisure facilities for the civil servants to use after a hard day processing tax returns. </p> <p>In Turner's Nottingham, people crowd on to boats about to pass through a newly opened lock. It's a political allegory. One of the boats even flies the Greek flag, expressing solidarity with the Byronic cause of Greek independence. These people are celebrating their own political triumph: Turner's watercolour was painted soon after the passing of the 1832 Reform Act, which radically enlarged the number of people who could vote. The grey smoke of stubble burning on Castle Rock alludes to the fact that, in 1831, after an earlier attempt to pass the act failed, the crowd at Nottingham's Goose Fair rioted and set fire to the castle owned by the anti-reform Duke of Newcastle. </p> <p>Down the road, the Via Fossa bar exploits its medievalesque setting but with contemporary verve - none of your Olde Englande kitsch, but lots of wrought iron, reddish lighting, deep comfy seats. Would Turner have enjoyed a drink here? Acquaintances claimed he was extremely stingy, and would make excuses if they suggested he buy a bottle of wine. </p> <p>It's the kind of titbit that has been passed down the years in place of biographical insight. Britain's greatest artist is also the most difficult to know. Biographers bounce off him. It's only when you get to page 300 of a recent tome that you realise you haven't learnt much beyond the basics: Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775-1851), son of a Covent Garden barber, began to draw and paint at an early age, worked as an architects' draughtsman and topographer, was admitted to the Royal Academy schools, was recognised early on as a landscape artist of genius, became a prominent Academician, yet died lonely but rich - regarded by Victorians as half-mad, his inarticulacy and lack of social graces having exiled him from polite society. Turner's extreme inability to express himself in words continues to make the man, as opposed to his universally enjoyable art, remote. </p> <p>What we do know about JMW Turner is that he travelled. A lot. Apart from painting, it was the passion of his life. He spent several months every year touring Britain or the continent, his watercolours in his luggage, drawing everything he saw that came up to his standards of natural and human spectacle. Turner's art is, among other things, a testament to new possibilities for tourism in the 19th century, from the Alpine roads built by Napoleon to the steamer that took him to Fingal's Cave in the Hebrides. </p> <p>Turner painted all over Europe; he also painted tropical and desert scenes he never saw. Yet at the core of his fame as the quintessential British artist are his British landscapes. A Londoner, he painted Thames vistas from Richmond to Margate, but he also painted Portsmouth, Norham Castle, Teesdale, sea towns from Whitby to Flint, medieval ruins from Conwy to Dover. Turner's watercolours and oil paintings constitute a visionary map of Britain. </p> <p>Next year is the 150th anniversary of Turner's death, and if we can't find out much about Turner the man, we can still see a lot of the places he saw. Yet the more you look for it, the more you realise that Turner's Britain is not - and never was - an empirically verifiable place. In Turner's lifetime the map of Britain changed. The 1832 Reform Act changed the political topography of Britain, abolished rotten boroughs, created new constituencies. Turner's art can be seen as a painterly Reform Act, imagining the British landscape no longer as the province of a few aristocratic landowners but as the imaginative playground of us all. </p> <p>It seems strange that a more urban Britain should have found its self-image in landscape art, but that is what happened in the Romantic era. The countryside became, for an increasingly towny nation, a view. It became picturesque. The story of British art from the pastoral portraits of Gainsborough and the classicised Snowdonian views of Richard Wilson in the 18th century through to Turner's last masterpieces of the 1840s, is the story of the discovery of a British landscape. </p> <p> Today the British landscape is changing again, not just politically with the devolution of Wales and Scotland, but physically. Our land itself seems to have become unstable, coastlines threatening to change shape, rivers bursting their banks. This winter the country is looking Turneresque and you don't need to lash yourself to the mast of a ship in a storm - as Turner claimed to have done - to find yourself at the turbulent centre of his art. Just take a walk up London's Richmond Hill. </p> <p>The view from Richmond Hill, once home to the Prince Regent and Mrs Fitzherbert, has been famous since the 17th century. Turner made it the subject of a watercolour, in which picnickers are dwarfed by a shining sky, the Thames landscape in front of them catching fire. He also did a vast oil painting of the scene as a birthday tribute to the Prince Regent in 1819, and called it England. Strolling up the hill today, past antique shops and posh houses, you can see Turner's painting in front of you. </p> <p>But something is wrong. It's more Turner than Turner. The river is not a gentle, meandering ribbon. It's a torrent. Pushing at its banks, the Thames flows incredibly fast and the meadow between the hill and the river is partially flooded. Walking down to the shore, you see the river forming whirlpools and causing boats to strain at their moorings as it roars towards London. You think of Turner's visions of floods, typhoons, the Biblical Deluge. </p> <p>Further up the Thames is the site of one of Turner's masterpieces. Rain, Steam and Speed - The Great Western Railway (1844) may be the most important painting of the 19th century. It was revered by the French Impressionists as an unprecedented attempt to paint the modern world. A steam train hurtles towards us out of a maelstrom of rain, cloud and golden light. Rain washes across the surface of the canvas from right to left while the river below gleams and the sky behind the train billows. </p> <p>There is nothing fixed in this painting. The people fishing down by the river, looking up at the train, are insubstantial spirits. Only the material force of iron and brick, of industrial and natural energy, has any reality. Turner's contemporary Karl Marx described it best: all that is solid melts into air. </p> <p>The viaduct in Turner's painting is a sturdy Victorian structure - an engineering marvel by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, boasting the longest brick arches in the world. It still exists and is still in use. You can find it crossing the Thames at Maidenhead. According to the Daily Telegraph Guide to Commuterland, the best, most expensive properties in town can be found on the Thames around Maidenhead Bridge. </p> <p>The first sign that things are not right is the top of a park bench, with a plaque naming the person it commemorates, sticking out of the fast-moving water. Then you notice a wrought-iron footbridge whose two ends have vanished, leaving just a platform sticking up pointlessly. Across the river, the car park of Maidenhead Rowing Club has gone and the front door is in the river. Houses behind have sandbags against the flood. </p> <p>Clambering across a fence and trespassing onto Railtrack property, you can climb the wooded bank towards the railway to try to get the exact view painted by Turner. It soon becomes clear that this pointless. Turner's painting is a view from above, as if he were looking down on the viaduct and river from a high hill. But there is no high hill. </p> <p>Although Turner's details are recognisable, he transformed everything. The Thames shore is depicted as a deep valley, almost a gorge, but the land here is low-lying. Looking across this scene painted by Turner, you feel there is nothing stable in the world. If you were considering Constable and you found the scene of one of his most famous paintings flooded, you would say his reassuring vision of British rural life had been drowned. But this looks like Turner's revenge. He saw this landscape as grand, religious and historical, a place of tempests and wonders - but we tend to imagine our country as suburban, quiet, and go on holiday elsewhere if we crave spectacle. </p> <p>This wild landscape is not Britain as we imagine it, but it is a Britain that Turner saw. Turner's paintings have come true. As the rivers burst their banks, this doesn't look like such a small, containable land after all. It looks sublime, cursed and blessed: a place of high drama. </p> <p>In the no man's land of the flooded shore under Brunel's railway bridge a flock of Canadian geese play, seeming to enjoy this new space. It is a place that does not exist on any official map, this apocalyptic little corner of Turner's Britain. </p> <p>\u0095 Turner: The Great Watercolours is at the Royal Academy, London W1 (020-7300 8000), until February 18. The Great Turner (1775-1851): A Tribute is at the National Gallery of Scotland, The Mound, Edinburgh (0131-624 6200), from January 1 to March 4.</p>",

In the nine months to September 30 Ision had revenues of \u00a340.7m and pre-tax losses of \u00a36.8m. Energis believes the market Ision operates in should sustain strong growth for several years. The takeover involves a cash and shares payment of \u20ac812m to Swiss firm Distefora for its 75% stake and an offer for the remaining publicly traded shares which is likely to take the deal value to \u20ac1bn. The move comes at a trying time for Energis. Wanadoo's recent takeover of Freeserve has cast some doubt on Energis's long-term relationship with the British internet firm. Their contract runs until September 2003. Energis had secured a position to become the network provider to Richard Branson's People's Lottery but yesterday's decision by regulators to stick with Camelot is thought to have cost it \u00a340-50m in annual revenues.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Anyone in their mid-30s with an ounce of rebellion in their soul will remember Daddy was a Bank Robber, by the Clash. I can remember sitting in my bedroom, playing that single over and over, memorising the words. I was the adopted daughter of a law-abiding Dorset schoolteacher and how I craved the romance of it all. I had absolutely no idea then, as a music- and crime-obsessed teenager, that two decades on I would attend the funeral of a real-life bank robber, called Bobby King, and that I would be present at the funeral because he was my father.</p> <p>I was 32 when I found out the identity of my parents. For years they had simply been names in letters that my adoptive parents had received from the Children's Society. My \"putative\" (such an insulting word) father's occupation was given as \"painter and decorator\", presumably it was considered potentially prejudicial to inform prospective parents that they were about to adopt the child of a criminal. Like many adopted people my origins were shrouded in mystery, secrecy and, worse, misinformation.</p> <p>Searching for birth-parents is not an easy task, either practically or emotionally, and it wasn't until my birth-mother contacted the Children's Society herself that I had any success. After finding her it was relatively straightforward to locate Bob; his infamy certainly sped up the process. One night, fuelled by a desperate need to know and rather too much wine, I rehearsed my words, found the courage and telephoned him. The emotional impact of hearing my father's voice for the first time was without precedent; it was such an absurd thing to be doing - phoning a total stranger in order to tell him that I was his daughter.</p> <p>Getting the words out was an enormous struggle: all I wanted to do was to slam down the phone and forget the whole awful mess. I had no idea how he was going to react. Although by this time I was pretty sure of my facts, I was only too aware that if he decided to refute what I was saying there would be very little I could say or do. As I was soon to discover, his reaction to my garbled news was actually very much in character: \"Fucking hell love, are you sure?\"</p> <p>It was an extraordinary journey, travelling from Brighton to London to meet Bob for the first time.</p> <p>Thankfully, most of us meet our parents long before we're 32. In most families, even if a mother or father is not there, evidence of them is. Bob's absence from my life had been complete: no photos, no family anecdotes. All I had to go on was the brief, fabricated reference to him in my adoption papers, rather vague recollections of his criminal tendencies from my birth-mother and one fraught telephone conversation. I was in such a state I found it almost impossible to navigate the underground. I remember staring at the tube map, clutching the directions Bob had given me over the phone, on the verge of tears. I was convinced that if I'd lost the ability to read, then I certainly wouldn't be able to speak to a stranger who was also, apparently, my father.</p> <p>Despite the stressful journey, I arrived early at Bob's aptly chosen venue, a pub called the Starting Gate. It was an unusually hot day, which didn't help matters. I was horribly sticky, feeling sick and shaky. Ordering a pint of Guinness, it was all I could do not to confide in the barmaid the reasons for my all too evident distracted demeanour. Instead I chose a table with a clear view of the door, pretended to read the Guardian and thanked God that I hadn't yet given up smoking. As neither of us had the foresight to plan how we would recognise each other, I was obsessed by the horrifying notion that I might accuse the wrong man of being my father. Such a ghastly mistake wouldn't have seemed out of place on such a peculiar day.</p> <p>It is perhaps hard to believe, but as soon as Bob walked into the bar, recognition was immediate. I watched him order his drink, walk towards me, holding his tobacco - the same brand as mine - and his Guardian and I was certain, absolutely certain, that this was my father. There was something about his posture and the shape of his face. Even before I heard him speak, he reminded me of me.</p> <p>During the next four hours or so, we entertained each other with stories of our lives and perhaps surprisingly, we liked each other. It was a surreal experience sitting in unfamiliar surroundings, opposite someone who both was and was not my father, and yet I remember it fondly. We were both at pains to put each other at ease, and initial fears gradually vanished. There was so much to tell.</p> <p>I had recently qualified as an English teacher but it had taken me rather a long time to get there. Like my birth-mother, I'd had my first child as an unmarried teenager although, unlike her, I was able to keep my baby. The terrific support I'd received from my parents enabled me to pass some A-levels and go to university. Studying for a degree in literature, I'd further complicated things by having a second child at a ridiculously impractical time. I described sitting my finals with a newborn daughter sleeping in her pram just outside the exam hall, nipping out to breastfeed, in between struggling with essays on feminist theory - the irony was not lost on Bob. He was delighted that I had such great parents and was more than a little relieved to find that I had at least some understanding of going about life unconventionally.</p> <p>Bob's tales of the crimes he'd committed, his conviction for armed robbery and his 10-year stretch in prison were turned into comic routines as he beautifully imitated the voices of lawyers and social workers. I was astounded by the extent of his involvement in the criminal underground. He told me that in prison he had a choice, either become an obsessive body-builder or an obsessive reader: he opted for the latter and was delighted to find that I loved the same, somewhat obscure books. Imagined or real, I am still staggered by the common ground we found. On subsequent occasions friends of mine met Bob and were equally struck by the uncanny resemblances, particularly by the mannerisms that we shared. Before finding my birth-parents I had never really given much credence to genetic inheritance, always believing that environmental factors were of primary importance. I am still struggling to understand how I could possibly have inherited characteristics from a father I had never known.</p> <p>Long-held assumptions I'd had about my identity, about my place in the world, were shifted in the space of an afternoon.

      "bodyText": "Anyone in their mid-30s with an ounce of rebellion in their soul will remember Daddy was a Bank Robber, by the Clash. I can remember sitting in my bedroom, playing that single over and over, memorising the words. I was the adopted daughter of a law-abiding Dorset schoolteacher and how I craved the romance of it all. I had absolutely no idea then, as a music- and crime-obsessed teenager, that two decades on I would attend the funeral of a real-life bank robber, called Bobby King, and that I would be present at the funeral because he was my father. I was 32 when I found out the identity of my parents. For years they had simply been names in letters that my adoptive parents had received from the Children's Society. My \"putative\" (such an insulting word) father's occupation was given as \"painter and decorator\", presumably it was considered potentially prejudicial to inform prospective parents that they were about to adopt the child of a criminal. Like many adopted people my origins were shrouded in mystery, secrecy and, worse, misinformation. Searching for birth-parents is not an easy task, either practically or emotionally, and it wasn't until my birth-mother contacted the Children's Society herself that I had any success. After finding her it was relatively straightforward to locate Bob; his infamy certainly sped up the process. One night, fuelled by a desperate need to know and rather too much wine, I rehearsed my words, found the courage and telephoned him. The emotional impact of hearing my father's voice for the first time was without precedent; it was such an absurd thing to be doing - phoning a total stranger in order to tell him that I was his daughter. Getting the words out was an enormous struggle: all I wanted to do was to slam down the phone and forget the whole awful mess. I had no idea how he was going to react. Although by this time I was pretty sure of my facts, I was only too aware that if he decided to refute what I was saying there would be very little I could say or do. As I was soon to discover, his reaction to my garbled news was actually very much in character: \"Fucking hell love, are you sure?\" It was an extraordinary journey, travelling from Brighton to London to meet Bob for the first time. Thankfully, most of us meet our parents long before we're 32. In most families, even if a mother or father is not there, evidence of them is. Bob's absence from my life had been complete: no photos, no family anecdotes. All I had to go on was the brief, fabricated reference to him in my adoption papers, rather vague recollections of his criminal tendencies from my birth-mother and one fraught telephone conversation. I was in such a state I found it almost impossible to navigate the underground. I remember staring at the tube map, clutching the directions Bob had given me over the phone, on the verge of tears. I was convinced that if I'd lost the ability to read, then I certainly wouldn't be able to speak to a stranger who was also, apparently, my father. Despite the stressful journey, I arrived early at Bob's aptly chosen venue, a pub called the Starting Gate. It was an unusually hot day, which didn't help matters. I was horribly sticky, feeling sick and shaky. Ordering a pint of Guinness, it was all I could do not to confide in the barmaid the reasons for my all too evident distracted demeanour. Instead I chose a table with a clear view of the door, pretended to read the Guardian and thanked God that I hadn't yet given up smoking. As neither of us had the foresight to plan how we would recognise each other, I was obsessed by the horrifying notion that I might accuse the wrong man of being my father. Such a ghastly mistake wouldn't have seemed out of place on such a peculiar day. It is perhaps hard to believe, but as soon as Bob walked into the bar, recognition was immediate. I watched him order his drink, walk towards me, holding his tobacco - the same brand as mine - and his Guardian and I was certain, absolutely certain, that this was my father. There was something about his posture and the shape of his face. Even before I heard him speak, he reminded me of me. During the next four hours or so, we entertained each other with stories of our lives and perhaps surprisingly, we liked each other. It was a surreal experience sitting in unfamiliar surroundings, opposite someone who both was and was not my father, and yet I remember it fondly. We were both at pains to put each other at ease, and initial fears gradually vanished. There was so much to tell. I had recently qualified as an English teacher but it had taken me rather a long time to get there. Like my birth-mother, I'd had my first child as an unmarried teenager although, unlike her, I was able to keep my baby. The terrific support I'd received from my parents enabled me to pass some A-levels and go to university. Studying for a degree in literature, I'd further complicated things by having a second child at a ridiculously impractical time. I described sitting my finals with a newborn daughter sleeping in her pram just outside the exam hall, nipping out to breastfeed, in between struggling with essays on feminist theory - the irony was not lost on Bob. He was delighted that I had such great parents and was more than a little relieved to find that I had at least some understanding of going about life unconventionally. Bob's tales of the crimes he'd committed, his conviction for armed robbery and his 10-year stretch in prison were turned into comic routines as he beautifully imitated the voices of lawyers and social workers. I was astounded by the extent of his involvement in the criminal underground. He told me that in prison he had a choice, either become an obsessive body-builder or an obsessive reader: he opted for the latter and was delighted to find that I loved the same, somewhat obscure books. Imagined or real, I am still staggered by the common ground we found. On subsequent occasions friends of mine met Bob and were equally struck by the uncanny resemblances, particularly by the mannerisms that we shared. Before finding my birth-parents I had never really given much credence to genetic inheritance, always believing that environmental factors were of primary importance. I am still struggling to understand how I could possibly have inherited characteristics from a father I had never known. Long-held assumptions I'd had about my identity, about my place in the world, were shifted in the space of an afternoon. Not only had I met this most unusual man, I also discovered that he already had two sons. Having grown up as the eldest of two adopted daughters, I was suddenly also the younger sister of two half brothers. Understandably, my fascination was overwhelming. Who were they? Where were they and what did they do? My head spun with questions. Bob was happy to talk about my brothers, clearly proud of the fact that both had steered clear of crime. Convinced that they would be as curious as I was, Bob promised to tell them both of my existence. Returning home that day I was both elated and exhausted. I now had some understanding of the affair that had led to my birth, my origins had finally become less mysterious. The following day I received a postcard from Bob; scrawled on the back was an extract from a poem. I can wade Grief - Whole Pools of it - I'm used to that - But the least push of Joy Breaks up my feet - Perhaps Bob was better suited to the hardships of prison life than to the potential joys of fatherhood.

She immediately told her boss, Michael Oates, who appeared \"irritated\". Five minutes later, a colleague told her she was being sacked for being unreliable.</p> <p>An employment tribunal in Manchester reached a unanimous decision in favour of Ms Percy, after reserving judgment in October. A compensation payout, based on loss of earnings, is to be decided. But Ms Percy found a new job one <br> day after being dismissed from the \u00a311,000 a year post, so she will receive only one day's pay.</p> <p>\"This claim is not about money, it is about the principle of parents' rights,\" she said yesterday. \"It is wrong to say that single mothers are the only ones who suffer.</p> <p>\"The issues of sick children affect any couple where both parents work. I realised I had my commitments to work and I did not want to leave them without a secretary but Thomas had a very infectious complaint. I just wanted to do what was best.\"</p> <p>Ms Percy had worked at the company for six weeks. Mr Oates told the tribunal he sacked her because she was unreliable, impolite and had an attitude problem. She had arrived 30 minutes late for work on another occasion because her son was ill.

      "bodyText": "A single mother who was sacked after asking to leave work to collect her sick son from school won a claim for unfair dismissal yesterday in the first case to test regulations allowing parents time off if their child falls ill. Julie Percy, 35, from Baguley, Manchester, is the first parent to win a claim under the maternity and parental leave regulations which came into force last year, giving parents the right to take a \"reasonable amount\" of time off to care for a dependant. In March, Ms Percy, who worked as a secretary for Metcalfe and Co, chartered surveyors, received a call from her eight-year-old son's school telling her he had a temperature and a discharge from his ear and needed to see a doctor. She immediately told her boss, Michael Oates, who appeared \"irritated\". Five minutes later, a colleague told her she was being sacked for being unreliable. An employment tribunal in Manchester reached a unanimous decision in favour of Ms Percy, after reserving judgment in October. A compensation payout, based on loss of earnings, is to be decided. But Ms Percy found a new job one day after being dismissed from the \u00a311,000 a year post, so she will receive only one day's pay. \"This claim is not about money, it is about the principle of parents' rights,\" she said yesterday. \"It is wrong to say that single mothers are the only ones who suffer. \"The issues of sick children affect any couple where both parents work. I realised I had my commitments to work and I did not want to leave them without a secretary but Thomas had a very infectious complaint. I just wanted to do what was best.\" Ms Percy had worked at the company for six weeks. Mr Oates told the tribunal he sacked her because she was unreliable, impolite and had an attitude problem. She had arrived 30 minutes late for work on another occasion because her son was ill. But she had also been praised by the firm and had been given two bottles of wine as a reward for good work. Mr Oates said Ms Percy did not ask to go and pick up her son, but told him she was leaving, presenting the decision as a fait accompli. He said he regarded this as an example of a bad attitude and \"the last straw\". The employment tribunal rejected the company's claim that Ms Percy was sacked not because she had to pick up her child, but because of the way she asked. Her solicitor, John Cook, said three similar claims had been lodged in different parts of the country but this was the first ruling under the regulations which were added to the 1996 Employment Rights Act. He said the case would set a precedent for parents. \"There has been a plethora of changes in employment law in the past two years and companies need to be aware of this before taking such drastic action,\" he said. \"Employees now have more rights than ever, regardless of how long they have worked for the company.\" Christine Gowdridge, director of Maternity Alliance, which campaigns for balance between work and childcare, said: \"This case is quite extraordinary because there is a very straightforward legal right to take time off if your child is sick and particularly in an emergency. \"It is quite right that the claim was won and maybe it will publicise this little known right that everyone has to care for a sick dependant, even an elderly relative.\"",

      "body": "<p>Norman McKillop-Concannon is an angry man. And he has good reason to be - having spent eight weeks sleeping on the tiled floor of an empty council flat after the benefits agency turned down his plea for help because of what appears a glaring anomaly. </p> <p>The 54-year-old Sheffield engineer has worked most of his life. He has experienced redundancy two or three times when the city's engineering industry hit hard times, but has always managed to find another job quickly. He has always paid his dues and kept his national insurance payments up-to-date against the day when his luck would change. </p> <p>And it did change. Five years ago, his skin reacted to a new industrial lubricating oil and he developed a painful and ugly looking dermatitis - a condition which left him with an allergic reaction to most oils. </p> <p>Unable to work in the trade he knew, he took a succession of caretaking jobs. Each time, though, the skin condition came back and forced him out. He coped until May, when he had to give up a job as a gardener/ handyman in Dore after the skin condition flared again. Without a wage, he had to apply for housing benefit. </p> <p>This was when the problems started. Mr McKillop-Concannon became one of thousands of people let down by CSL, the company which took over the administration of housing benefits from Sheffield council's in-house service. Such a backlog of claims built up that hundreds of tenants faced eviction. </p> <p>Mr McKillop-Concannon was one of those who were evicted. He lost the furnished flat he had lived in for 27 years. But he bears no grudge against his landlady - and he even shrugs his shoulders over CSL's record. \"These things happen,\" he said, \"and there are other people who've been hit a lot harder than me.\" </p> <p>The deep resentment he carries around with him stems from what happened next. Knowing he was about to become homeless, he contacted the council's housing department which found him an unfurnished flat in the Broomhall area of Sheffield. All he needed was some basic furniture - a cooker and a bed - and he could start rebuilding his life again. </p> <p>Not a problem, he thought. He went to the benefits agency and applied for a community care grant from the social fund to buy the basics. But his application was turned down - he was left to sleep on the hard, tiled floor of the flat, unable to cook for himself, and nursing a growing anger. </p> <p>\"I don't want anyone to go through what I've gone through,\" he said. \"I have had to put up with so much crap from an organisation that's supposed to be there to meet social need, but doesn't seem to give a damn about people. </p> <p>\"For three months I've been told to fill in this form and that form, and never once has anyone asked me how I'm coping. Never once have they asked me if I needed any extra help or suggested somewhere I could go for help.\" </p> <p>After filling out the forms, the agency told him he did not qualify for a grant because he was not receiving income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance. \"After looking at your application and personal circumstances, we have decided the qualifying conditions for a payment from the social fund are not satisfied,\" said the letter turning down his application. </p> <p>At first, Mr McKillop-Concannon thought it was just a mistake: after all, he was getting jobseeker's allowance. \"But,\" he said, \"it wasn't the right kind of jobseeker's allowance, apparently.\" </p> <p>His allowance did not count because it was contribution-based, not means-tested. \"In other words, the fact that I had paid my contributions up-to-date meant I couldn't get the help I needed. It's insane. I was sleeping on the floor; I didn't have a cooker and I still couldn't get help because I'd been such a good boy and paid into the system. </p> <p>\"What was worse was the way I was treated. I was made to feel like a scrounger - like someone begging for help they had no right to. They treated me as if I was trying to con the system.\" </p> <p>Mr McKillop-Concannon was told he would have to wait six months. Only then would he become qualified for means-tested benefits, in turn qualifying him for help from the social fund. \"If I hadn't qualified for contribution-based support - if I hadn't paid my stamps - I could have got help straight away,\" he said. \"It's madness.\" </p> <p>His complaints and requests for a review produced another rejection and, at the end of August, he applied for a crisis loan. That was turned down, too. Sleeping on the floor with nothing to cook on did not amount to a risk to the \"health or safety\" of a 54-year-old.

      "bodyText": "Norman McKillop-Concannon is an angry man. And he has good reason to be - having spent eight weeks sleeping on the tiled floor of an empty council flat after the benefits agency turned down his plea for help because of what appears a glaring anomaly. The 54-year-old Sheffield engineer has worked most of his life. He has experienced redundancy two or three times when the city's engineering industry hit hard times, but has always managed to find another job quickly. He has always paid his dues and kept his national insurance payments up-to-date against the day when his luck would change. And it did change. Five years ago, his skin reacted to a new industrial lubricating oil and he developed a painful and ugly looking dermatitis - a condition which left him with an allergic reaction to most oils. Unable to work in the trade he knew, he took a succession of caretaking jobs. Each time, though, the skin condition came back and forced him out. He coped until May, when he had to give up a job as a gardener/ handyman in Dore after the skin condition flared again. Without a wage, he had to apply for housing benefit. This was when the problems started. Mr McKillop-Concannon became one of thousands of people let down by CSL, the company which took over the administration of housing benefits from Sheffield council's in-house service. Such a backlog of claims built up that hundreds of tenants faced eviction. Mr McKillop-Concannon was one of those who were evicted. He lost the furnished flat he had lived in for 27 years. But he bears no grudge against his landlady - and he even shrugs his shoulders over CSL's record. \"These things happen,\" he said, \"and there are other people who've been hit a lot harder than me.\" The deep resentment he carries around with him stems from what happened next. Knowing he was about to become homeless, he contacted the council's housing department which found him an unfurnished flat in the Broomhall area of Sheffield. All he needed was some basic furniture - a cooker and a bed - and he could start rebuilding his life again. Not a problem, he thought. He went to the benefits agency and applied for a community care grant from the social fund to buy the basics. But his application was turned down - he was left to sleep on the hard, tiled floor of the flat, unable to cook for himself, and nursing a growing anger. \"I don't want anyone to go through what I've gone through,\" he said. \"I have had to put up with so much crap from an organisation that's supposed to be there to meet social need, but doesn't seem to give a damn about people. \"For three months I've been told to fill in this form and that form, and never once has anyone asked me how I'm coping. Never once have they asked me if I needed any extra help or suggested somewhere I could go for help.\" After filling out the forms, the agency told him he did not qualify for a grant because he was not receiving income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance. \"After looking at your application and personal circumstances, we have decided the qualifying conditions for a payment from the social fund are not satisfied,\" said the letter turning down his application. At first, Mr McKillop-Concannon thought it was just a mistake: after all, he was getting jobseeker's allowance. \"But,\" he said, \"it wasn't the right kind of jobseeker's allowance, apparently.\" His allowance did not count because it was contribution-based, not means-tested. \"In other words, the fact that I had paid my contributions up-to-date meant I couldn't get the help I needed. It's insane. I was sleeping on the floor; I didn't have a cooker and I still couldn't get help because I'd been such a good boy and paid into the system. \"What was worse was the way I was treated. I was made to feel like a scrounger - like someone begging for help they had no right to. They treated me as if I was trying to con the system.\" Mr McKillop-Concannon was told he would have to wait six months. Only then would he become qualified for means-tested benefits, in turn qualifying him for help from the social fund. \"If I hadn't qualified for contribution-based support - if I hadn't paid my stamps - I could have got help straight away,\" he said. \"It's madness.\" His complaints and requests for a review produced another rejection and, at the end of August, he applied for a crisis loan. That was turned down, too. Sleeping on the floor with nothing to cook on did not amount to a risk to the \"health or safety\" of a 54-year-old. But he appealed again and, after an interview, his application was reconsidered and he has received a loan of \u00a3320. There is now a bed and a cooker in his flat and, thanks to the concern of the caretaker of his block of flats, he has a three-piece suite and a couple of bits and pieces that somebody else threw out. The housing benefit he applied for in May finally arrived last month, but he has just been diagnosed as clinically depressed - the first time in his life he has ever been \"anywhere near depression\". The benefits agency admits that cases such as Mr McKillop-Concannon's are \"a difficult area\". A spokesman said: \"On the other hand, we have to have rules to prevent people who can afford to live off their own income from claiming the benefits that are there for people who can't - and given that fact, a line has to be drawn somewhere.\"",

The withdrawal of welfare benefits from most 16 and 17-year-olds must be one factor, but another is that many young adults simply lack the basic skills to live independently. </p> <p>One organisation seeking to address this is the Brunswick Centre Young People's Project in Newcastle upon Tyne, a drop-in centre for impoverished and homeless l6 to 25-year-olds, which is running courses to help its users secure and keep tenancies. \"Things like how to keep a rent book or get your electricity turned on sound obvious,\" said course facilitator Tracey Morgan. \"But if you've never done it, how do you know what to do? Lots of young people don't cope because they've never learned how to live alone.\" </p> <p>The Brunswick's \"independent living skills\" course has been so successful that, last month, 35 representatives of charities and voluntary organisations - from the YMCA to Barnardo's - went to Newcastle to learn how to teach the course to young people in housing difficulty in their own areas. </p> <p>The majority of teenagers who secure tenancies run into financial difficulties and rent arrears. But there are other problems, such as how to tell unwanted visitors to stop coming round, taking drugs and causing trouble. \"Many young people living alone lack the confidence and assertiveness to say no, so they lose their tenancies as a result,\" said Ms Morgan. \"We need to get them to understand what assertiveness is, that it's different from aggression, and to develop that quality. When we teach this session, it's interesting when the most dominant person in the group usually loses control as the other members gain confidence.\" </p> <p>The Brunswick, which operates out of a room made available by a church in the centre of Newcastle, has about 170 clients on its books. One is Sean Wilkinson, a charming and sociable 21-year-old who completed the course two years ago. </p> <p>Mr Wilkinson had broken up with his girlfriend, with whom he shared a flat. Subsequently, he become homeless and, like one in three people who live rough, developed mental health problems. He found himself living on the streets of Newcastle after a spell in a psychiatric hospital. Eventually, an organisation called Stepping Stones picked him up. He recalls: \"They got me a flat with the Richmond Fellowship, which gives accommodation to people with mental health problems, but I still have to budget and pay for electricity, food, phone and gas. I couldn't have done it without the help I've had here. I got into such a mess with money in the past. I ran up debts of \u00a3700 after I split up with my partner.\" </p> <p>Ms Morgan helped Mr Wilkinson draw up a payment plan for his debts and a budget for day-to-day living. He's still signed off sick, but is decorating his flat and has high hopes of pursuing his interest in cooking when he is better. \"I've already passed the NVQ,\" he said. \"I'd love to own my own restaurant one day. I know I'm good.\" </p> <p>Care leavers constitute up to half of all homeless people. Ros Kelly, who has studied the independent living skills course to take back to Barnardo's, where she helps vulnerable young people to secure accommodation, said: \"Care leavers are so institutionalised, they haven't got a clue how to look after themselves. They've never cooked a meal or washed a shirt. They've grown up thinking, 'No matter how badly I behave, someone will look after me.' Well, they soon find out that's just not true.\" </p> <p>She believes the reason that so many young people leave home at l6 is \"abuse in all its varieties\", usually involving poverty and, quite often, a step-parent the teenager does not get on with. But sometimes it is just the impatience and intolerance of parents. \"Kids at l6 can be a pain in the neck, and they're often chucked out at that age by parents who forget they get over that stage and usually turn out OK,\" Kelly said. \"In other instances, though, it's outright violence and sexual abuse.\" </p> <p>Having so far taught one group of 14-year-olds, Kelly believes course participants need to have a failed tenancy behind them to appreciate what can go wrong. And there needs to be a change in attitude to these common failures. \"Young people need to realise it's normal to leave home, make a mess of it, and try again,\" she said. \"Currently, they are made to feel failures by a system which doesn't always appreciate these kids haven't got an open door at home.\" </p> <p>On a weekday afternoon, the Brunswick Centre is full of young people chatting, feeding children and getting advice from staff member Theresa Carey. Compared to other big cities, Newcastle has a large stock of accommodation for the homeless, although many bed spaces are held by long-term residents. </p> <p>Ms Carey said: \"The YMCA is proud of the fact that people stay in its supported accommodation so long, but it's not good because it's institutionalising them. Some become part of a subculture, moving from hostel to hostel. But when the time comes to move on and live independently, they can't do it. Bills come in and they throw them away. Supported accommodation should be short-term, because it detracts from the skills young people need to live their own lives.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>For many disabled and frail elderly people, assisted bathing is a godsend. \"It's become the rose of my week,\" says one. \"It's lovely, like being a baby again,\" says another. But despite such appreciation, and the critical importance of enabling people to continue living independently, help with bathing is a greatly overlooked aspect of social care. </p> <p>Why? According to Julia Twigg, author of a new book from which the above comments are taken, there remains a real taboo on discussion of bodily needs. In social services, moreover, the prevailing culture rarely permits proper consideration of the intensely personal nature of helping somebody to wash. \"Much has been written on managerial issues,\" she said, \"but very little that addresses the frontline realities of giving such care.\" </p> <p>Yet these realities raise a host of fascinating and challenging questions. Typically, an elderly person who as an adult may never have been seen naked by anybody except their spouse - and possibly not even by them - is expected to welcome a stranger into their home to help them with a most private act. That stranger, often young, may never before have seen an older person unclothed, in a society where ageing bodies are not visible. </p> <p>And the generational differences do not end with physical appearance. Ms Twigg recounts one episode where a young (female) care worker sought to wash the hair of an elderly (male) client. \"How dare you!\" he shouted. \"I've never washed my hair in 30-odd years!\" </p> <p>The book, Bathing - the Body and Community Care, is a first and ambitious attempt to look comprehensively at what the author describes as a \"missing dimension\" in the analysis of community care. It is based on a study, funded by the economic and social research council, of assisted bathing services in two sharply contrasting localities: a relatively wealthy area of inner London, where clients included the titled, and a deprived coastal district, where most clients were defined as lower-middle or working class. </p> <p>In all, 30 recipients of bathing help - 21 women and nine men - were interviewed either directly or, in the cases of three people with dementia, through their carers. Interviews were also conducted with 34 care workers - 31 women and three men - employed by social services or voluntary/private sector agencies, as well as four community nurses, three day centre staff and five frontline managers. </p> <p>Ms Twigg, reader in social policy at the University of Kent, found that receiving help had been an unwelcome development for most of the clients. \"Crossing this boundary ... marks a major shift in people's lives,\" she writes. Nevertheless, most approached the issue \"with stoicism\". </p> <p>One woman said: \"Well, at the beginning I didn't like being personally washed, of course, but after six years I haven't got any more hold-ups [sic] about that ...\" Another said that \"you pretend it doesn't matter\", but added: \"There are some people who are very liberated and I don't know, they sunbathe and wash naked ... well, I am too old, a generation not thinking that way.\" </p> <p>Some had set their own boundaries, such as insisting on washing intimate areas themselves. \"She would do underneath if I let her,\" said one woman of her care worker, \"but I said: 'No, if you don't mind Doreen, I'd rather do underneath myself.'\" </p> <p>Most women clients were adamant that they would not want a male bathing assistant. But this was not always a product of past prudishness: one woman confessed to having \"liked fun and games in my time, but not now - no\". As well as consciousness of their ageing bodies, this may reflect an acute awareness of what Ms Twigg describes as the inherently unequal power dynamics of assisted bathing - an inequality emphasised by gender difference. </p> <p>\"One person, strong and able, stands above and over another who is frail and physically vulnerable, forced to rely on their strength and goodwill,\" the author writes. \"Being naked in the face of someone who is not, contains a powerful dynamic of domination and vulnerability, and it is often used in situations of interrogation and torture as a means of subjugating the individual.\" </p> <p>For the care worker, the initial experience of assisted bathing can be equally disconcerting. One London client, named as Sir Peter, said: \"It's rather bad luck on the girls, scrubbing old gentlemen's backs.\" One worker admitted: \"It was a shock how, you know, I look at a person's body and say: 'Gosh, their body was like mine and look what it deteriorates to.'\" </p> <p>Such deterioration does not begin and end with appearances. As one worker confided: \"When Mrs Jones isn't quite so well one day, and you've got diarrhoea from the toilet to the front door, you know you've got to be able to have a bit of stomach for the job to actually be able to clear that up.\" </p> <p>The work, of course, tends to be poorly paid. Yet several workers in the study had degrees or were transitional staff, on their way to other roles in the care sector, such as social work or graduate nursing, or \"resting\" from their mainstream occupation. One worker was a dancer; another a singer-songwriter. </p> <p>Many of the London workers were black, with race emerging as a key theme at that study site. As Ms Twigg acknowledges, some of the clients had \"fairly racist\" views that created potential tension. She quotes one woman saying: \"I may be wrong here, but I think most white people, we have similar toilet habits - they may have quite different ones.\" Another said: \"I'm sorry I have to say, I'm not anti-racial [sic] at all but some of these black girls are very arrogant and belligerent and rude.\" </p> <p>In general, the black workers had become inured to such views. One said that \"if I hear it and I find it offensive, then I'll be like 'oh, you're so cheeky, how can you say that?'\" But one (male) worker, from Sierra Leone, turned the tables, remarking that in Africa \"we don't have social care ... the relatives take care of their old people\". </p> <p>Ms Twigg confesses that writing the book was not an altogether comfortable experience. \"I wanted to write about this topic, and not write in an evasive way,\" she said, \"but I did put things down on the page and then ask myself: 'Can I really say this about Mrs so-and-so?' </p> <p>\"There was a tension between a wish to be unevasive and a wish not to lessen, to demean the people I was writing about. I found that quite difficult at the time and I suppose that it is one of the reasons this remains such a taboo area.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Bathing - the Body and Community Care is published by Routledge at \u00a315.99</p>",

Yet several workers in the study had degrees or were transitional staff, on their way to other roles in the care sector, such as social work or graduate nursing, or \"resting\" from their mainstream occupation. One worker was a dancer; another a singer-songwriter. Many of the London workers were black, with race emerging as a key theme at that study site. As Ms Twigg acknowledges, some of the clients had \"fairly racist\" views that created potential tension. She quotes one woman saying: \"I may be wrong here, but I think most white people, we have similar toilet habits - they may have quite different ones.\" Another said: \"I'm sorry I have to say, I'm not anti-racial [sic] at all but some of these black girls are very arrogant and belligerent and rude.\" In general, the black workers had become inured to such views. One said that \"if I hear it and I find it offensive, then I'll be like 'oh, you're so cheeky, how can you say that?'\" But one (male) worker, from Sierra Leone, turned the tables, remarking that in Africa \"we don't have social care ... the relatives take care of their old people\". Ms Twigg confesses that writing the book was not an altogether comfortable experience. \"I wanted to write about this topic, and not write in an evasive way,\" she said, \"but I did put things down on the page and then ask myself: 'Can I really say this about Mrs so-and-so?' \"There was a tension between a wish to be unevasive and a wish not to lessen, to demean the people I was writing about. I found that quite difficult at the time and I suppose that it is one of the reasons this remains such a taboo area.\" \u0095 Bathing - the Body and Community Care is published by Routledge at \u00a315.99",

Following an inquiry into the killing, the regional NHS office has promised further checks to ensure reforms are implemented. </p> <p>Ms Morrison, 51, had almost 20 years' experience as a social worker.

      "bodyText": "Two years after social worker Jenny Morrison was stabbed to death by a client in a south London hostel, health and social services have begun to overhaul the system that failed her. Following an inquiry into the killing, the regional NHS office has promised further checks to ensure reforms are implemented. Ms Morrison, 51, had almost 20 years' experience as a social worker. On the day she died, she went to the Thurleigh Road hostel in Balham because of a deterioration in the condition of her client, Anthony Joseph, a paranoid schizophrenic. The inquiry reported last week that when she went, unaccompanied, with Joseph into the hostel's isolated lounge - a room with no panic alarms and no easy escape route - she had not been told he had previously been convicted for carrying a knife, had threatened mental hospital staff and had a history of sleeping with a machete under his pillow. In addition, she was unaware that he had spoken about \"demons\" torturing him and that he had said she \"would be brave\" to see him. Within minutes of their meeting, Joseph went to the hostel kitchen, fetched a knife and stabbed her more than 100 times. There was only one member of staff, a woman, on duty at the hostel. Joseph has been convicted of manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility and sent to Broadmoor special hospital indefinitely. The independent inquiry, chaired by barrister Peter Herbert, found that the risks Joseph posed to himself and others were \"systematically underestimated\". The inquiry report criticises Wandsworth council, which runs the hostel, and the South West London and St George's mental health trust, which coordinated his care, for \"serious management and systems failures\". Ms Morrison had planned to meet Joseph in the company of the hostel's manager and deputy manager, but had problems with her car and had to get a lift, arriving before they did. Irrespective of this, the report criticises the hostel's failure to meet Wandsworth's own minimum requirement of at least two care staff on duty at all times. In addition, it finds that inadequate, \"ad hoc\" sharing of vital information among professionals increased the likelihood of a fatality occurring. Neither Morrison nor the hostel staff were informed that Joseph had threatened his mother with a knife. Hostel staff had also not been told that he had previously been charged with possession of a kitchen knife, or that he had made threatening phone calls to two nurses at the Maudsley hospital, south London,where he had been a patient. Finally, the inquiry found there had been a three-week delay between hostel staff noticing that Joseph's behaviour had deteriorated and Ms Morrison being informed. Joseph had become Ms Morrison's client in 1998 when he was discharged from Springfield. In contrast to his earlier discharge from the Maudsley, he received no written care plan, no risk assessment in accordance with the care programme approach, no systematic monitoring of his medication and no out-patient follow-up.

      "body": "<p>A plan to open a hostel for asylum seekers has been thrown out after angry residents raised a storm of protest. They told their local council they feared that young children and elderly people would be put at risk and there would be a breakdown of law and order. The council said it understood their fears and turned down the proposal. Nobody was being racist, said councillors, but the hostel would be better placed somewhere else. </p> <p>Such episodes may not be headline news these days, but this didn't take place in a shires village or a well-heeled suburb of a commuter belt town. It happened last month in a pit village near Rotherham, in the heartland of what was once known as the Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire. The planning board of Rotherham borough council, on which Labour holds 58 of the 66 seats, refused to give the go-ahead for 30 men to be given refuge in the village of Wath upon Dearne while their applications for asylum were being processed. </p> <p>Those who remember the political action that centred on Sheffield and the nearby towns of Barnsley, Doncaster and Rotherham in the 70s and 80s may find it hard to believe that this could have happened in what was once a hotbed of socialism. After all, South Yorkshire threw open its arms to refugees from Chile who fled the Pinochet regime. Those asylum seekers - and others from across the globe - were warmly welcomed by communities throughout the county. In Sheffield, it was almost a state occasion when political activists were called to the City Hall ballroom to attend yet another welcoming party for refugees. What mattered above all else was that asylum seekers were made to feel at home. </p> <p>And at home they felt. Few Saturdays went by in South Yorkshire without a demonstration in support of some cause or other, and refugees were actively encouraged to march side by side with their new found friends. This was where the victorious miners' strikes of 1972 and 1974 were masterminded. It was here that Sheffield city council continually attempted to frustrate the Conservative government of the 80s, and the council's new leader, a youthful David Blunkett, had the red flag flown over the town hall to the annoyance of Thatcher and her ministers. </p> <p>Throughout the mines, the railways and the steel and engineering works, the socialist message rang out. Here, and overseas, fellow workers could count on the support of the rank and file in South Yorkshire. That, it seems, is no longer the way in at least one part of the \"socialist republic\". </p> <p>In October, residents of Wath upon Dearne, a former mining community on the outskirts of Rotherham, learned that a planning application had gone before the borough council to change the use of a former residential nursing home to a 30-bed hostel for asylum seekers. Rotherham businessman Terry Watson, owner of the building, had tried for more than a year to find a buyer. It had stood empty as he sought to sell it as a nursing home, flats or a hotel, but he had been unable to stimulate any interest. </p> <p>Mr Watson had reached an agreement with Safe Haven, a not-for-profit body, backed by a group of housing associations and sponsored by the Home Office, to turn the building into a hostel for refugees catering for up to 30 single men aged 18 to 30. </p> <p>But the plan triggered an outcry among locals. Feelings ran high at public meetings. A petition, with more than 700 signatures, and numerous letters from individual residents were sent to the council demanding the scheme be thrown out. </p> <p>Residents argued that the hostel should be sited on a council estate, not in a private residential area; that there would be an increase in crime, including vandalism and \"social disorder\"; and that property prices would fall. One resident claimed that parents would be \"terrified of letting their children play out\". Another asked: \"Can we be assured there are no child abusers, drug addicts or convicted rapists among them?\" </p> <p>Only one local stood up in defiance and supported the plan. Ged Dempsey, a delegate to Rotherham trades council and a member of a number of human rights groups, called on the local authority to join with the trades council and local churches \"to assist in demystifying, informing, challenging and breaking down the barriers to the issues involved\". </p> <p>Through the trades council, Mr Dempsey wrote to union branches and churches urging them to support his stand that asylum seekers were entitled to basic human rights and had been unjustly \"stigmatised, alienated and segregated\". He pointed out that the TUC's annual congress had agreed unanimously to defend the rights of asylum seekers. </p> <p>He was later supported by a number of churchmen. The Rev Tim Leach, of All Saints Church in the village, was one of two who attended a public meeting and spoke on behalf of accepting the refugees. He said: \"Among local residents, there were a good few who were not against the proposal. Regrettably, those who were against it were most vociferous.\" </p> <p>Rotherham's planners took everything into consideration and recommended to the planning board that the application be granted, stating: \"The premises shall be used as a hostel for asylum seekers only and for no other purpose. Asylum seekers occupying the premises shall be referred by the Home Office or local housing authority.\" But when board members started to discuss the plan, a very different view emerged. </p> <p>Labour member Sheila Walker, who chairs the board, told the meeting: \"I know what a close-knit community they are in Wath and this is not prejudice. This is nothing to do with racism. It's about whether this is the right place, and in our opinion it is not.\" Another Labour councillor, Margaret Clark, said: \"We live in a multicultural town, but some parts of Rotherham are more multicultural than others.\" </p> <p>If that was a blow to the men and women who built South Yorkshire's socialist republic, then what happened next was even worse. Moving that the plan be kicked out was Labour member and former National Union of Mineworkers stalwart Brian Walker, himself from Wath. He told the meeting: \"We have a long history of ethnic support and advice groups in the centre of Rotherham. We do not feel it would be fair to be putting them (the asylum seekers) out in Wath. Some of the asylum seekers don't want to be here. They want to be in the big cities where the jobs and the action are.\" Mr Walker was seconded by fellow Labour member Roger Stone, a former national president of the steel union, ISTC. </p> <p>Mr Walker and Mr Stone are two staunch trade unionists from industries that helped breed the socialists who built South Yorkshire's reputation. Together, they led the unanimous rejection of the hostel scheme. </p> <p>The council's planners, who had supported the proposal, were sent away to draw up an explanation for the scheme's rejection. A week later, the council reported that \"the full decision is still being formulated\". Eventually, the planners announced that the hostel would \"generate an unacceptable level of perceived fear\" for local residents in an area \"characterised by family housing\" and would be \"detrimental to the general residential majority of these residents\". This, said the planners belatedly, would not conform with the town's unitary development plan. </p> <p>It was also stressed that the council considered there was a general lack of support services in the area, which would mean refugees having to travel five miles into Rotherham - a journey \"inconvenient, unsettling and unsustainable\". </p> <p>This does not stand up to scrutiny, claims Tim Fordham, of Safe Haven. He said: \"If you take the line of argument about a lack of facilities to an ultimate conclusion, you would say that any area of the country which presently has no facilities for either asylum seekers or Britain's black and ethnic community should never accommodate people from these communities. This is clearly creating exclusion zones.\" There would have been mini-buses to take the refugees into Rotherham, Fordham adds. </p> <p>Safe Haven had supplied the council with answers to all the concerns raised by local residents in the days before the planning board met. Fordham addressed councillors on the day and believes he showed there was no evidence asylum seekers helped increase the crime rate. After all, it was in a refugee's interest not to be involved in crime lest it affect the final outcome of their case. He stressed there was no evidence to suggest asylum seekers offered a particular threat to old people and young children, or that house prices would be affected. </p> <p>He had already explained in writing that Safe Haven successfully managed a number of projects housing refugees elsewhere in South Yorkshire. He told them that when a similar scheme had been proposed in the High Green district of Sheffield, itwas met with hostility from the local community, but that Safe Haven had worked with local residents and their initial fears had not been realised. </p> <p> Arthur Jepson chairs the residents' association in High Green. He admits there were fears that allowing 34 flats to be used to house asylum seekers, most of them single men, would bring trouble to the district. \"Like everyone else, we had heard bad reports, but Safe Haven reassured us that this would not be the case,\" he said. \"We trusted them and gave them our support and we now find we have a community of nice people living among us.\" </p> <p>Jepson went to speak at a public meeting in Wath to try to allay any fears and reassure the protesters that Safe Haven would manage the scheme properly. \"I got a real slating,\" he said. \"All they could say was that our community could take the refugees if that was how we felt.\" </p> <p>Wath vicar Mr Leach believes Rotherham council should have trusted Safe Haven to manage the Wath scheme properly. \"The council should have made its decision on the merits of the application,\" he said. \"If there was a company who could manage it effectively and well, then it should have been given the chance. It seems Safe Haven was that company.\" </p> <p>Safe Haven, which is considering an appeal, has accused the council of taking a decision \"based on prejudice rather than on planning guidance\". Mr Dempsey echoes this. \"What the councillors did goes against everything that has been said nationally by both the Labour party and the TUC. They are not respecting socialist values,\" he said. \"The decision reeks of discrimination and intolerance when we in South Yorkshire have been in the forefront of the fight against injustice and prejudice through generation after generation. It's a very sad day indeed.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>University Hospital Birmingham last week became the fourth NHS trust in England to launch a new-style audiology service, complete with state-of-the-art digital hearing aids, as part of a \u00a310m project to bring services into the 21st century. The Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID) is at the forefront of this programme which warrants the label \"groundbreaking\" as much for its implementation, as its likely impact. For it is one of the first examples of a charity co-managing a Department of Health project. </p> <p>The relationship between the RNID, the department and fellow partners - the NHS's purchasing and supplies agency and the Medical Research Council's institute of hearing research - has been testing. Initial discussions constantly verged on breakdown. </p> <p>In one corner, the RNID was arguing for digital hearing aids to be universally available, insisting that the NHS's purchasing power - by far the largest in the world, with 600,000 aids bought each year - could reduce the \u00a32,000 retail price to \u00a375. In the other corner, NHS purchasing and supplies was challenging this premise and denying the figures. The charity also had to fight against the project becoming totally research-focused, instead of being the first wave of a national implementation stategy. </p> <p>Five million people could benefit from wearing a hearing aid. This number includes more than half of all people over 60. Yet only 2m have one, and of these, a third hardly use them. Technology some 30 years out of date - which accounts for hearing aids that whistle and amplify background noise as much as speech - plus waiting lists of up to 18 months for a hearing aid test are just two of the reasons for the low take-up. </p> <p>\"Audiology is a derelict service,\" said John Lowe, director of technology at the RNID. \"It's often out the back of a hospital, has no soundproof rooms to conduct hearing tests, is underfunded and staff morale is low. It's not a priority. After all, people don't die of hearing loss.\" </p> <p>The first-wave project intends to evaluate the costs and benefits of digital hearing aids and to examine the most effective ways to provide them through the NHS. But it is not just about 20 NHS trusts buying the latest technology and making it widely available. It is about modernising the whole service. This involves recruiting extra staff, working with IT departments, buying computer equipment, developing new service protocols and training staff in those protocols, and in fitting digital hearing aids. </p> <p>Having embarrassed the government, by highlighting the gulf between NHS hearing aids and their hi-tech counterparts available privately for \u00a32,000, the RNID was asked by the health department in January to co-manage the project. Mr Lowe admits this came as a shock and was not easy for a campaigning organisation to accept. </p> <p>\"We had to think carefully if our involvement would be good or bad,\" he said. \"We were flattered and we didn't want to respond to that. In the end, we thought the project would be more effective if we became part of the team.\" Having made clear that involvement would not silence its campaign to get the project rolled out across all audiology clinics, the charity took up the challenge. </p> <p>The department says partnership-working is a key government objective. \"We are using the RNID because of its expertise,\" said a spokesman, adding that views of the National Deaf Children's Society and British Deaf Association were also taken on board through a project reference group. </p> <p>The RNID's project management role entailed recruiting a first-wave team, comprising a full-time member of staff responsible for the day-to-day running of the project, an assistant and a project audiologist - seconded on a part-time basis from the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading - to advise on equipment, training and service delivery. In addition, much of Mr Lowe's time and that of James Strachan, RNID chief executive, is going into the project - not to mention the work of the charity's communications team in producing newsletters for audiology departments. </p> <p>According to the charity, all this is paid for out of the \u00a34m allocated by government for the project's first year. Some \u00a32m is paying for digital hearing aids, \u00a31.4m for computer equipment and the rest for extra staffing and training across the 15 trusts involved since April. Another five go live next April. </p> <p>Approaching half of the 240 audiology departments in England applied to become a first-wave project. The 20 selected represent a cross-section - from large, well-equipped city clinics to small, rural outfits. The Royal United hospital in Bath has been fitting the Starkey Gemini behind-the-ear digital hearing aid since the end of September. Andrew Reid, the hospital's head of audiology, said: \"It is a lot of stuff for the 10 staff to learn. There is ongoing training in using new audiology equipment and specialised computer software to programme the aids.\" </p> <p>Independent researchers are based at each of the 20 trusts. Their job is to examine the cost benefits of digital hearing aids, compared to the analogue variety, using quality of life measures. They will also test whether two digital aids are better than one and the effectiveness of four different aids. </p> <p>The audiology service currently costs the NHS \u00a357m a year or \u00a395 a person (\u00a345 for the analogue hearing aid and \u00a350 for the service). The RNID expects this to increase to a maximum of \u00a3138m a year or \u00a3230 a person (\u00a3150 for a digital aid and \u00a380 for an improved service), although it firmly believes the cost of digital aids can be brought down with economies of scale once the project is rolled out to all audiology departments by 2004.

      "bodyText": "University Hospital Birmingham last week became the fourth NHS trust in England to launch a new-style audiology service, complete with state-of-the-art digital hearing aids, as part of a \u00a310m project to bring services into the 21st century. The Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID) is at the forefront of this programme which warrants the label \"groundbreaking\" as much for its implementation, as its likely impact. For it is one of the first examples of a charity co-managing a Department of Health project. The relationship between the RNID, the department and fellow partners - the NHS's purchasing and supplies agency and the Medical Research Council's institute of hearing research - has been testing. Initial discussions constantly verged on breakdown. In one corner, the RNID was arguing for digital hearing aids to be universally available, insisting that the NHS's purchasing power - by far the largest in the world, with 600,000 aids bought each year - could reduce the \u00a32,000 retail price to \u00a375. In the other corner, NHS purchasing and supplies was challenging this premise and denying the figures. The charity also had to fight against the project becoming totally research-focused, instead of being the first wave of a national implementation stategy. Five million people could benefit from wearing a hearing aid. This number includes more than half of all people over 60. Yet only 2m have one, and of these, a third hardly use them. Technology some 30 years out of date - which accounts for hearing aids that whistle and amplify background noise as much as speech - plus waiting lists of up to 18 months for a hearing aid test are just two of the reasons for the low take-up. \"Audiology is a derelict service,\" said John Lowe, director of technology at the RNID. \"It's often out the back of a hospital, has no soundproof rooms to conduct hearing tests, is underfunded and staff morale is low. It's not a priority. After all, people don't die of hearing loss.\" The first-wave project intends to evaluate the costs and benefits of digital hearing aids and to examine the most effective ways to provide them through the NHS. But it is not just about 20 NHS trusts buying the latest technology and making it widely available. It is about modernising the whole service. This involves recruiting extra staff, working with IT departments, buying computer equipment, developing new service protocols and training staff in those protocols, and in fitting digital hearing aids.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For many disabled and frail elderly people, assisted bathing is a godsend. \"It's become the rose of my week,\" says one. \"It's lovely, like being a baby again,\" says another. But despite such appreciation, and the critical importance of enabling people to continue living independently, help with bathing is a greatly overlooked aspect of social care. </p> <p>Why? According to Julia Twigg, author of a new book from which the above comments are taken, there remains a real taboo on discussion of bodily needs. In social services, moreover, the prevailing culture rarely permits proper consideration of the intensely personal nature of helping somebody to wash. \"Much has been written on managerial issues,\" she says, \"but very little that addresses the frontline realities of giving such care.\" </p> <p>Yet these realities raise a host of fascinating and challenging questions. Typically, an elderly person who as an adult may never have been seen naked by anybody except their spouse - and possibly not even by them - is expected to welcome a stranger into their home to help them with a most private act. That stranger, often young, may never before have seen an older person unclothed, in a society where ageing bodies are not visible. </p> <p>And the generational differences do not end with physical appearance. Twigg recounts one episode where a young (female) care worker sought to wash the hair of an elderly (male) client. \"How dare you!' he shouted. \"I've never washed my hair in 30-odd years!\" </p> <p>The book, Bathing - the Body and Community Care, is a first and ambitious attempt to look comprehensively at what the author describes as a \"missing dimension\" in the analysis of community care. It is based on a study, funded by the economic and social research council, of assisted bathing services in two sharply contrasting localities: a relatively wealthy area of inner London, where clients included the titled, and a deprived coastal district, where most clients were defined as lower-middle or working class. </p> <p>In all, 30 recipients of bathing help - 21 women and nine men - were interviewed either directly or, in the cases of three people with dementia, through their carers. Interviews were also conducted with 34 care workers - 31 women and three men - employed by social services or voluntary/private sector agencies, as well as four community nurses, three day centre staff and five frontline managers. </p> <p>Twigg, reader in social policy at the University of Kent, found that receiving help had been an unwelcome development for most of the clients. \"Crossing this boundary ... marks a major shift in people's lives,\" she writes. Nevertheless, most approached the issue \"with stoicism\". </p> <p>One woman said: \"Well, at the beginning I didn't like being personally washed, of course, but after six years I haven't got any more hold-ups [sic] about that ...\" Another said that \"you pretend it doesn't matter\", but added: \"There are some people who are very liberated and I don't know, they sunbathe and wash naked ... well, I am too old, a generation not thinking that way.\" </p> <p>Some had set their own boundaries, such as insisting on washing intimate areas themselves. \"She would do underneath if I let her,\" said one woman of her care worker, \"but I said: 'No, if you don't mind Doreen, I'd rather do underneath myself.'\" </p> <p>Most women clients were adamant that they would not want a male bathing assistant. But this was not always a product of past prudishness: one woman confessed to having \"liked fun and games in my time, but not now - no\". As well as consciousness of their ageing bodies, this may reflect an acute awareness of what Twigg describes as the inherently unequal power dynamics of assisted bathing - an inequality emphasised by gender difference. </p> <p>\"One person, strong and able, stands above and over another who is frail and physically vulnerable, forced to rely on their strength and goodwill,\" the author writes. \"Being naked in the face of someone who is not, contains a powerful dynamic of domination and vulnerability, and it is often used in situations of interrogation and torture as a means of subjugating the individual.\" </p> <p>For the care worker, the initial experience of assisted bathing can be equally disconcerting. One London client, named as Sir Peter, said: \"It's rather bad luck on the girls, scrubbing old gentlemen's backs.\" One worker admitted: \"It was a shock how, you know, I look at a person's body and say: 'Gosh, their body was like mine and look what it deteriorates to.'\" </p> <p>Such deterioration does not begin and end with appearances. As one worker confided: \"When Mrs Jones isn't quite so well one day, and you've got diarrhoea from the toilet to the front door, you know you've got to be able to have a bit of stomach for the job to actually be able to clear that up.\" </p> <p>The work, of course, tends to be poorly paid. Yet several workers in the study had degrees or were transitional staff, on their way to other roles in the care sector, such as social work or graduate nursing, or \"resting\" from their mainstream occupation. One worker was a dancer; another a singer-songwriter. </p> <p>Many of the London workers were black, with race emerging as a key theme at that study site.

      "bodyText": "For many disabled and frail elderly people, assisted bathing is a godsend. \"It's become the rose of my week,\" says one. \"It's lovely, like being a baby again,\" says another. But despite such appreciation, and the critical importance of enabling people to continue living independently, help with bathing is a greatly overlooked aspect of social care. Why? According to Julia Twigg, author of a new book from which the above comments are taken, there remains a real taboo on discussion of bodily needs. In social services, moreover, the prevailing culture rarely permits proper consideration of the intensely personal nature of helping somebody to wash. \"Much has been written on managerial issues,\" she says, \"but very little that addresses the frontline realities of giving such care.\" Yet these realities raise a host of fascinating and challenging questions. Typically, an elderly person who as an adult may never have been seen naked by anybody except their spouse - and possibly not even by them - is expected to welcome a stranger into their home to help them with a most private act. That stranger, often young, may never before have seen an older person unclothed, in a society where ageing bodies are not visible. And the generational differences do not end with physical appearance. Twigg recounts one episode where a young (female) care worker sought to wash the hair of an elderly (male) client. \"How dare you!' he shouted. \"I've never washed my hair in 30-odd years!\" The book, Bathing - the Body and Community Care, is a first and ambitious attempt to look comprehensively at what the author describes as a \"missing dimension\" in the analysis of community care. It is based on a study, funded by the economic and social research council, of assisted bathing services in two sharply contrasting localities: a relatively wealthy area of inner London, where clients included the titled, and a deprived coastal district, where most clients were defined as lower-middle or working class. In all, 30 recipients of bathing help - 21 women and nine men - were interviewed either directly or, in the cases of three people with dementia, through their carers. Interviews were also conducted with 34 care workers - 31 women and three men - employed by social services or voluntary/private sector agencies, as well as four community nurses, three day centre staff and five frontline managers. Twigg, reader in social policy at the University of Kent, found that receiving help had been an unwelcome development for most of the clients. \"Crossing this boundary ... marks a major shift in people's lives,\" she writes. Nevertheless, most approached the issue \"with stoicism\". One woman said: \"Well, at the beginning I didn't like being personally washed, of course, but after six years I haven't got any more hold-ups [sic] about that ...\" Another said that \"you pretend it doesn't matter\", but added: \"There are some people who are very liberated and I don't know, they sunbathe and wash naked ... well, I am too old, a generation not thinking that way.\" Some had set their own boundaries, such as insisting on washing intimate areas themselves. \"She would do underneath if I let her,\" said one woman of her care worker, \"but I said: 'No, if you don't mind Doreen, I'd rather do underneath myself.'\" Most women clients were adamant that they would not want a male bathing assistant. But this was not always a product of past prudishness: one woman confessed to having \"liked fun and games in my time, but not now - no\". As well as consciousness of their ageing bodies, this may reflect an acute awareness of what Twigg describes as the inherently unequal power dynamics of assisted bathing - an inequality emphasised by gender difference. \"One person, strong and able, stands above and over another who is frail and physically vulnerable, forced to rely on their strength and goodwill,\" the author writes. \"Being naked in the face of someone who is not, contains a powerful dynamic of domination and vulnerability, and it is often used in situations of interrogation and torture as a means of subjugating the individual.\" For the care worker, the initial experience of assisted bathing can be equally disconcerting. One London client, named as Sir Peter, said: \"It's rather bad luck on the girls, scrubbing old gentlemen's backs.\" One worker admitted: \"It was a shock how, you know, I look at a person's body and say: 'Gosh, their body was like mine and look what it deteriorates to.'\" Such deterioration does not begin and end with appearances. As one worker confided: \"When Mrs Jones isn't quite so well one day, and you've got diarrhoea from the toilet to the front door, you know you've got to be able to have a bit of stomach for the job to actually be able to clear that up.\" The work, of course, tends to be poorly paid. Yet several workers in the study had degrees or were transitional staff, on their way to other roles in the care sector, such as social work or graduate nursing, or \"resting\" from their mainstream occupation. One worker was a dancer; another a singer-songwriter. Many of the London workers were black, with race emerging as a key theme at that study site. As Twigg acknowledges, some of the clients had \"fairly racist\" views that created potential tension. She quotes one woman saying: \"I may be wrong here, but I think most white people, we have similar toilet habits - they may have quite different ones.\" Another said: \"I'm sorry I have to say, I'm not anti-racial [sic] at all but some of these black girls are very arrogant and belligerent and rude.\" In general, the black workers had become inured to such views. One said that \"if I hear it and I find it offensive, then I'll be like 'oh, you're so cheeky, how can you say that?'\" But one (male) worker, from Sierra Leone, turned the tables, remarking that in Africa \"we don't have social care ... the relatives take care of their old people\". Twigg confesses that writing the book was not an altogether comfortable experience. \"I wanted to write about this topic, and not write in an evasive way,\" she says, \"but I did put things down on the page and then ask myself: 'Can I really say this about Mrs so-and-so?' \"There was a tension between a wish to be unevasive and a wish not to lessen, to demean the people I was writing about.

Without a wage, he had to apply for housing benefit. </p> <p>This was when the problems started.

Knowing he was about to become homeless, he contacted the council's housing department which found him an unfurnished flat in the Broomhall area of Sheffield. All he needed was some basic furniture - a cooker and a bed - and he could start rebuilding his life again. </p> <p>Not a problem, he thought. He went to the benefits agency and applied for a community care grant from the social fund to buy the basics. But his application was turned down - he was left to sleep on the hard, tiled floor of the flat, unable to cook for himself, and nursing a growing anger. </p> <p>\"I don't want anyone to go through what I've gone through,\" he says. \"I have had to put up with so much crap from an organisation that's supposed to be there to meet social need, but doesn't seem to give a damn about people. </p> <p>\"For three months I've been told to fill in this form and that form, and never once has anyone asked me how I'm coping. Never once have they asked me if I needed any extra help or suggested somewhere I could go for help.\" </p> <p>After filling out the forms, the agency told him he did not qualify for a grant because he was not receiving income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance. \"After looking at your application and personal circumstances, we have decided the qualifying conditions for a payment from the social fund are not satisfied,\" said the letter turning down his application. </p> <p>At first, McKillop-Concannon thought it was just a mistake: after all, he was getting jobseeker's allowance. \"But,\" he now says, \"it wasn't the right kind of jobseeker's allowance, apparently.\" </p> <p>His allowance did not count because it was contribution-based, not means-tested. \"In other words, the fact that I had paid my contributions up-to-date meant I couldn't get the help I needed. It's insane. I was sleeping on the floor; I didn't have a cooker and I still couldn't get help because I'd been such a good boy and paid into the system. </p> <p>\"What was worse was the way I was treated. I was made to feel like a scrounger - like someone begging for help they had no right to. They treated me as if I was trying to con the system.\" </p> <p>McKillop-Concannon was told he would have to wait six months. Only then would he become qualified for means-tested benefits, in turn qualifying him for help from the social fund. \"If I hadn't qualified for contribution-based support - if I hadn't paid my stamps - I could have got help straight away,\" he says. \"It's madness.\" </p> <p>His complaints and requests for a review produced another rejection and, at the end of August, he applied for a crisis loan. That was turned down, too. Sleeping on the floor with nothing to cook on did not amount to a risk to the \"health or safety\" of a 54-year-old.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>University Hospital Birmingham last week became the fourth NHS trust in England to launch a new-style audiology service, complete with state-of-the-art digital hearing aids, as part of a \u00a310m project to bring services into the 21st century. The Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID) is at the forefront of this programme which warrants the label \"groundbreaking\" as much for its implementation, as its likely impact. For it is one of the first examples of a charity co-managing a Department of Health project. </p> <p>The relationship between the RNID, the department and fellow partners - the NHS's purchasing and supplies agency and the Medical Research Council's institute of hearing research - has been testing. Initial discussions constantly verged on breakdown. </p> <p>In one corner, the RNID was arguing for digital hearing aids to be universally available, insisting that the NHS's purchasing power - by far the largest in the world, with 600,000 aids bought each year - could reduce the \u00a32,000 retail price to \u00a375. In the other corner, NHS purchasing and supplies was challenging this premise and denying the figures. The charity also had to fight against the project becoming totally research-focused, instead of being the first wave of a national implementation stategy. </p> <p>Five million people could benefit from wearing a hearing aid. This number includes more than half of all people over 60. Yet only 2m have one, and of these, a third hardly use them. Technology some 30 years out of date - which accounts for hearing aids that whistle and amplify background noise as much as speech - plus waiting lists of up to 18 months for a hearing aid test are just two of the reasons for the low take-up. </p> <p>\"Audiology is a derelict service,\" says John Lowe, director of technology at the RNID. \"It's often out the back of a hospital, has no soundproof rooms to conduct hearing tests, is underfunded and staff morale is low. It's not a priority. After all, people don't die of hearing loss.\" </p> <p>The first-wave project intends to evaluate the costs and benefits of digital hearing aids and to examine the most effective ways to provide them through the NHS. But it is not just about 20 NHS trusts buying the latest technology and making it widely available. It is about modernising the whole service. This involves recruiting extra staff, working with IT departments, buying computer equipment, developing new service protocols and training staff in those protocols, and in fitting digital hearing aids. </p> <p>Having embarrassed the government, by highlighting the gulf between NHS hearing aids and their hi-tech counterparts available privately for \u00a32,000, the RNID was asked by the health department in January to co-manage the project. Low admits this came as a shock and was not easy for a campaigning organisation to accept. </p> <p>\"We had to think carefully if our involvement would be good or bad,\" he says. \"We were flattered and we didn't want to respond to that. In the end, we thought the project would be more effective if we became part of the team.\" Having made clear that involvement would not silence its campaign to get the project rolled out across all audiology clinics, the charity took up the challenge. </p> <p>The department says partnership-working is a key government objective. \"We are using the RNID because of its expertise,\" says a spokesman, adding that views of the National Deaf Children's Society and British Deaf Association were also taken on board through a project reference group. </p> <p>The RNID's project management role entailed recruiting a first-wave team, comprising a full-time member of staff responsible for the day-to-day running of the project, an assistant and a project audiologist - seconded on a part-time basis from the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading - to advise on equipment, training and service delivery. In addition, much of Lowe's time and that of James Strachan, RNID chief executive, is going into the project - not to mention the work of the charity's communications team in producing newsletters for audiology departments. </p> <p>According to the charity, all this is paid for out of the \u00a34m allocated by government for the project's first year. Some \u00a32m is paying for digital hearing aids, \u00a31.4m for computer equipment and the rest for extra staffing and training across the 15 trusts involved since April. Another five go live next April. </p> <p>Approaching half of the 240 audiology departments in England applied to become a first-wave project. The 20 selected represent a cross-section - from large, well-equipped city clinics to small, rural outfits. The Royal United hospital in Bath has been fitting the Starkey Gemini behind-the-ear digital hearing aid since the end of September. Andrew Reid, the hospital's head of audiology, says: \"It is a lot of stuff for the 10 staff to learn. There is ongoing training in using new audiology equipment and specialised computer software to programme the aids.\" </p> <p>Independent researchers are based at each of the 20 trusts. Their job is to examine the cost benefits of digital hearing aids, compared to the analogue variety, using quality of life measures. They will also test whether two digital aids are better than one and the effectiveness of four different aids. </p> <p>The audiology service currently costs the NHS \u00a357m a year or \u00a395 a person (\u00a345 for the analogue hearing aid and \u00a350 for the service). The RNID expects this to increase to a maximum of \u00a3138m a year or \u00a3230 a person (\u00a3150 for a digital aid and \u00a380 for an improved service), although it firmly believes the cost of digital aids can be brought down with economies of scale once the project is rolled out to all audiology departments by 2004. The government has committed an initial \u00a325m for this. </p> <p>With partnership a much maligned term, Strachan likens the charity's role vis-a-vis the government, to a joint business venture. \"This is not contracting out,\" he says. \"It is closer to seconding our expertise and knowledge to the Department of Health with both sides having contractual obligations.\" </p> <p>Despite having started work in February, the contract was only signed last month after RNID lawyers advised that it could not be held to the delivery of a government project. Contract wording was changed to \"best endeavours to coordinate\". </p> <p>For other charities thinking of taking a similar route, Strachan says the key is to identify a problem and provide a solution by putting yourself in the shoes of government. \"We came in as a catalyst, telling government that we could affect the lives of millions for relatively little money. Now that must be music to most ministers' ears.\" </p> <p><strong> Joy of hearing classical music </strong><br></p> <p> Kathleen Brown, 85, has had a hearing aid for 10 years. Last week she was fitted with a digital model at Bath's Royal United hospital. \"Now I can hear what my two sons and their families are saying,\" she says. \"I used to wear my old hearing aid all the time, but it was inadequate. I used to see they were talking, but because I couldn't hear the words, I'd ask a question and find out that was what they'd been talking about.

Lucy Kyle Cambridge Battle of Hastings Although arguably the largest and most rapid development in the history of Hastings took place during the last century, it is far from a \"Victorian seaside town\" (Road rage, December 13).

I fear that the despoilation of this once most beautiful of towns and its surrounds is set to continue with the building of a pointless, and environmentally-damaging bypass very much on the cards. Steve Potter Hastings Appropriate behaviour? As a trainer of \"appropriate adults\", I was concerned at some of the points made by Karen Liebreich and her role as a voluntary appropriate adult (AA) in Hounslow, west London (Lessons for life, December 13). Given that one of the main roles of the AA is to support the young person in the hostile environment of the police station, and if necessary challenge the police, she should not be accepting \"rides home in squad cars\". She also does not seem to realise that at the time she is being the AA, all the young people she is working with are innocent. All her deductions seem based on an assumption of guilt.

Her simplistic attitudes to parenting, education, benefits and family transmission theories raise serious concerns about the level of training she has been given by social services or the young offender team she is representing. Research for the royal commission on criminal justice, conducted more than 10 years ago, found that many AAs did not understand the role, colluded with police and rarely opened their mouths in the interview. It seems that things have not changed much since then. Denis W Jones Seaford, East Sussex \u0095 Does Hounslow pay an allowance and mileage to their appropriate adults? If so, I might not have to worry about \"a recently arrived Somali boy\" making it back in the dark on his own to his \"undoubtedly depressing hostel\" and explaining to his aunt about final warnings, court appearances and recent \"interrogation\" in a police station. Am I alone in remembering when this service to children was given greater priority by local authorities? Stephen Boote Liverpool Spending power You state (Pump action, December 6) that total spending by \"local\" - parish and small town - councils cannot exceed \u00a33.50 per elector in a financial year (often known colloquially as the \"free resource\" although, of course, it is not \"free\" at all). This is incorrect.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Children in care must be haunted by what has happened to them, but all too often lack an outlet for their feelings. A new publication from Essex social services sets out to remedy that. </p> <p>A Suitcase Full of Emotions is a slim volume of poems, stories and drawings by children and young people who are, or have been, in the department's care. Some contributions are funny; many are heart-rendingly sad. All offer a rare insight into why youngsters end up in care and their experiences there - bad and good. </p> <p>In an impressive coup, Essex persuaded Andrew Motion, the poet laureate, to write a foreword to the collection. He calls it a \"very touching\" record of life for those in care. \"But they also show care for themselves: care for words, for shape, for rhythm, for coherence and for self-expression,\" he says. </p> <p>Seventeen-year-old Becky, one of the contributors, is now living with a family after being in children's homes. She says that at times she \"found it easier to express my feelings in writing than to speak to people\". John, also 17, says: \"Writing was a very good way for me to release frustration and aggression and I would like to write some more in the future.\" </p> <p>Sandra Coward, manager of children's residential services in Essex, says she has seen so much creative writing by youngsters that a publication was a natural progression. \"There are some powerful messages to take on board. Many of the children have experienced a great deal of pain in their lives and that comes through very strongly in the book.\" </p> <p>One of the most moving contributions is by Rosemary, 16, who writes in despair on being told she is to leave the home where she has settled and found the kind of support she never had from her mother. </p> <p>\"Love was a hard word for my mum - she did not like to cuddle me, I was only there to be shouted at and be hit when she was in anger,\" Rosemary says. \"I think my life was supposed to be hard and [to] live without a dad who did not love me, a mum who rejected me because she had no one else to hurt except me - me, the person who looks like the person who hurt her so badly. </p> <p>\"For 16 years it has been hard and upsetting and ruined, but people say it will only get better in years to come. It won't, it will get harder to live alone and everything is still dragging along [because] of what's happened to me for 16 bloody years and I will never forget the hurt, heart-broken sexual abuse - used, not loved - that happened to me, it will come with me no matter where I will go or where I will end up.\" </p> <p> <strong> I'd Like </strong><br></p> <p> I'd like to go home, <br></p> <p>For them to leave me <br></p> <p>alone, <br></p> <p>I'd like hope in my Life <br></p> <p>Not loads of strife. <br></p> <p>I'd like to have my mother, <br></p> <p>Or someone who cares, <br></p> <p>Someone who wants me, <br></p> <p>And will always be there. <br></p> <p>I don't want much more <br></p> <p>From my not so short life <br></p> <p>Just someone to listen <br></p> <p>And not WALK AWAY!<br> </p> <p>\u0095 Jodie, who wrote this poem for a forum organised by the It's My Life young people's group and Essex children's rights services. </p> <p><strong> A Notice </strong><br></p> <p> If you're happy, you will be and feel better <br></p> <p>Don't feel sad feel happy, families don't want to see you sad. <br></p> <p>Jump up and turn around and make a change, <br></p> <p>a new start is just what you need <br></p> <p>Be happy on home contact <br></p> <p>Be nice to people in the home <br></p> <p>Respect children's things, do not be naughty <br></p> <p>or take the things and break them. <br></p> <p>Be happy just what you want <br></p> <p>Try and be good you never know, <br></p> <p>you might go home with your Mum.<br> </p> <p>\u0095 Kimberley, 10, who lived in an Essex children's home <br></p> <p> <strong> A suitcase full of emotions </strong><br></p> <p> Why must I always run <br></p> <p>Forever searching <br></p> <p>Always seeking <br></p> <p>Never reaching <br></p> <p>The bed left unmade <br></p> <p>Coffee cups remain dirty <br></p> <p>Goodbye!! never spoken <br></p> <p>I gave you a suitcase <br></p> <p>Full of emotions <br></p> <p>Full of Hopes <br></p> <p>Full of fears <br></p> <p>Even the last of my secrets I <br></p> <p>Gave to you <br></p> <p>Leaving myself open wide <br></p> <p>Vulnerable, defenceless <br></p> <p>Exposed, torn away <br></p> <p>All of myself on display <br></p> <p>Every secret uncovered <br></p> <p>All rocks left unturned <br></p> <p>And still you come back for more <br></p> <p>\u0095 Denise, 14, who lives in an Essex children's home </p> <p>A Suitcase Full of Emotions is on sale at Chelmsford library at \u00a32.

      "bodyText": "Children in care must be haunted by what has happened to them, but all too often lack an outlet for their feelings. A new publication from Essex social services sets out to remedy that. A Suitcase Full of Emotions is a slim volume of poems, stories and drawings by children and young people who are, or have been, in the department's care. Some contributions are funny; many are heart-rendingly sad. All offer a rare insight into why youngsters end up in care and their experiences there - bad and good. In an impressive coup, Essex persuaded Andrew Motion, the poet laureate, to write a foreword to the collection. He calls it a \"very touching\" record of life for those in care. \"But they also show care for themselves: care for words, for shape, for rhythm, for coherence and for self-expression,\" he says. Seventeen-year-old Becky, one of the contributors, is now living with a family after being in children's homes. She says that at times she \"found it easier to express my feelings in writing than to speak to people\". John, also 17, says: \"Writing was a very good way for me to release frustration and aggression and I would like to write some more in the future.\" Sandra Coward, manager of children's residential services in Essex, says she has seen so much creative writing by youngsters that a publication was a natural progression. \"There are some powerful messages to take on board. Many of the children have experienced a great deal of pain in their lives and that comes through very strongly in the book.\" One of the most moving contributions is by Rosemary, 16, who writes in despair on being told she is to leave the home where she has settled and found the kind of support she never had from her mother. \"Love was a hard word for my mum - she did not like to cuddle me, I was only there to be shouted at and be hit when she was in anger,\" Rosemary says. \"I think my life was supposed to be hard and [to] live without a dad who did not love me, a mum who rejected me because she had no one else to hurt except me - me, the person who looks like the person who hurt her so badly. \"For 16 years it has been hard and upsetting and ruined, but people say it will only get better in years to come. It won't, it will get harder to live alone and everything is still dragging along [because] of what's happened to me for 16 bloody years and I will never forget the hurt, heart-broken sexual abuse - used, not loved - that happened to me, it will come with me no matter where I will go or where I will end up.\" I'd Like I'd like to go home, For them to leave me alone, I'd like hope in my Life Not loads of strife. I'd like to have my mother, Or someone who cares, Someone who wants me, And will always be there. I don't want much more From my not so short life Just someone to listen And not WALK AWAY! \u0095 Jodie, who wrote this poem for a forum organised by the It's My Life young people's group and Essex children's rights services. A Notice If you're happy, you will be and feel better Don't feel sad feel happy, families don't want to see you sad. Jump up and turn around and make a change, a new start is just what you need Be happy on home contact Be nice to people in the home Respect children's things, do not be naughty or take the things and break them. Be happy just what you want Try and be good you never know, you might go home with your Mum. \u0095 Kimberley, 10, who lived in an Essex children's home A suitcase full of emotions Why must I always run Forever searching Always seeking Never reaching The bed left unmade Coffee cups remain dirty Goodbye!! never spoken I gave you a suitcase Full of emotions Full of Hopes Full of fears Even the last of my secrets I Gave to you Leaving myself open wide Vulnerable, defenceless Exposed, torn away All of myself on display Every secret uncovered All rocks left unturned And still you come back for more \u0095 Denise, 14, who lives in an Essex children's home A Suitcase Full of Emotions is on sale at Chelmsford library at \u00a32. It can also be ordered by telephoning 01245-434247 or 01245-434179.",

The withdrawal of welfare benefits from most 16 and 17-year-olds must be one factor, but another is that many young adults simply lack the basic skills to live independently. </p> <p>One organisation seeking to address this is the Brunswick Centre Young People's Project in Newcastle upon Tyne, a drop-in centre for impoverished and homeless l6 to 25-year-olds, which is running courses to help its users secure and keep tenancies. \"Things like how to keep a rent book or get your electricity turned on sound obvious,\" says course facilitator Tracey Morgan. \"But if you've never done it, how do you know what to do? Lots of young people don't cope because they've never learned how to live alone.\" </p> <p>The Brunswick's \"independent living skills\" course has been so successful that, last month, 35 representatives of charities and voluntary organisations - from the YMCA to Barnardo's - went to Newcastle to learn how to teach the course to young people in housing difficulty in their own areas. </p> <p>The majority of teenagers who secure tenancies run into financial difficulties and rent arrears. But there are other problems, such as how to tell unwanted visitors to stop coming round, taking drugs and causing trouble. \"Many young people living alone lack the confidence and assertiveness to say no, so they lose their tenancies as a result,\" says Morgan. \"We need to get them to understand what assertiveness is, that it's different from aggression, and to develop that quality. When we teach this session, it's interesting when the most dominant person in the group usually loses control as the other members gain confidence.\" </p> <p>The Brunswick, which operates out of a room made available by a church in the centre of Newcastle, has about 170 clients on its books. One is Sean Wilkinson, a charming and sociable 21-year-old who completed the course two years ago. </p> <p>Wilkinson had broken up with his girlfriend, with whom he shared a flat. Subsequently, he become homeless and, like one in three people who live rough, developed mental health problems. He found himself living on the streets of Newcastle after a spell in a psychiatric hospital. Eventually, an organisation called Stepping Stones picked him up. He recalls: \"They got me a flat with the Richmond Fellowship, which gives accommodation to people with mental health problems, but I still have to budget and pay for electricity, food, phone and gas. I couldn't have done it without the help I've had here. I got into such a mess with money in the past. I ran up debts of \u00a3700 after I split up with my partner.\" </p> <p>Morgan helped Wilkinson draw up a payment plan for his debts and a budget for day-to-day living. He's still signed off sick, but is decorating his flat and has high hopes of pursuing his interest in cooking when he is better. \"I've already passed the NVQ,\" he says. \"I'd love to own my own restaurant one day. I know I'm good.\" </p> <p>Care leavers constitute up to half of all homeless people. Ros Kelly, who has studied the independent living skills course to take back to Barnardo's, where she helps vulnerable young people to secure accommodation, says: \"Care leavers are so institutionalised, they haven't got a clue how to look after themselves. They've never cooked a meal or washed a shirt. They've grown up thinking, 'No matter how badly I behave, someone will look after me.' Well, they soon find out that's just not true.\" </p> <p>She believes the reason that so many young people leave home at l6 is \"abuse in all its varieties\", usually involving poverty and, quite often, a step-parent the teenager does not get on with. But sometimes it is just the impatience and intolerance of parents. \"Kids at l6 can be a pain in the neck, and they're often chucked out at that age by parents who forget they get over that stage and usually turn out OK,\" Kelly says. \"In other instances, though, it's outright violence and sexual abuse.\" </p> <p> Having so far taught one group of 14-year-olds, Kelly believes course participants need to have a failed tenancy behind them to appreciate what can go wrong. And there needs to be a change in attitude to these common failures. \"Young people need to realise it's normal to leave home, make a mess of it, and try again,\" she says. \"Currently, they are made to feel failures by a system which doesn't always appreciate these kids haven't got an open door at home.\" </p> <p>On a weekday afternoon, the Brunswick Centre is full of young people chatting, feeding children and getting advice from staff member Theresa Carey.

Some become part of a subculture, moving from hostel to hostel. But when the time comes to move on and live independently, they can't do it. Bills come in and they throw them away.

      "body": "<p>Two years after social worker Jenny Morrison was stabbed to death by a client in a south London hostel, health and social services have begun to overhaul the system that failed her. Following an inquiry into the killing, the regional NHS office has promised further checks to ensure reforms are implemented. </p> <p>Morrison, 51, had almost 20 years' experience as a social worker. On the day she died, she went to the Thurleigh Road hostel in Balham because of a deterioration in the condition of her client, Anthony Joseph, a paranoid schizophrenic. </p> <p>The inquiry reported last week that when she went, unaccompanied, with Joseph into the hostel's isolated lounge - a room with no panic alarms and no easy escape route - she had not been told he had previously been convicted for carrying a knife, had threatened mental hospital staff and had a history of sleeping with a machete under his pillow. In addition, she was unaware that he had spoken about \"demons\" torturing him and that he had said she \"would be brave\" to see him. </p> <p>Within minutes of their meeting, Joseph went to the hostel kitchen, fetched a knife and stabbed her more than 100 times. There was only one member of staff, a woman, on duty at the hostel. </p> <p>Joseph has been convicted of manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility and sent to Broadmoor special hospital indefinitely. </p> <p>The independent inquiry, chaired by barrister Peter Herbert, found that the risks Joseph posed to himself and others were \"systematically underestimated\". The inquiry report criticises Wandsworth council, which runs the hostel, and the South West London and St George's mental health trust, which coordinated his care, for \"serious management and systems failures\". </p> <p>Morrison had planned to meet Joseph in the company of the hostel's manager and deputy manager, but had problems with her car and had to get a lift, arriving before they did. Irrespective of this, the report criticises the hostel's failure to meet Wandsworth's own minimum requirement of at least two care staff on duty at all times. </p> <p>In addition, it finds that inadequate, \"ad hoc\" sharing of vital information among professionals increased the likelihood of a fatality occurring. Neither Morrison nor the hostel staff were informed that Joseph had threatened his mother with a knife. </p> <p>Hostel staff had also not been told that he had previously been charged with possession of a kitchen knife, or that he had made threatening phone calls to two nurses at the Maudsley hospital, south London,where he had been a patient. </p> <p>Finally, the inquiry found there had been a three-week delay between hostel staff noticing that Joseph's behaviour had deteriorated and Morrison being informed. </p> <p>Joseph had become Morrison's client in 1998 when he was discharged from Springfield. In contrast to his earlier discharge from the Maudsley, he received no written care plan, no risk assessment in accordance with the care programme approach, no systematic monitoring of his medication and no out-patient follow-up. The hostel was also found to lack proper emergency procedures. </p> <p>The inquiry panel recommended improved hospital discharge procedures, staff training programmes, management procedures and supervision of medication. The council and the trust say they have already done much of this, but the London NHS region says it will be checking up. </p> <p>Herbert says the findings have national implications for mental health services. If Department of Health guidelines had been followed, there would have been less risk of a serious incident occurring.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two years after social worker Jenny Morrison was stabbed to death by a client in a south London hostel, health and social services have begun to overhaul the system that failed her. Following an inquiry into the killing, the regional NHS office has promised further checks to ensure reforms are implemented. Morrison, 51, had almost 20 years' experience as a social worker. On the day she died, she went to the Thurleigh Road hostel in Balham because of a deterioration in the condition of her client, Anthony Joseph, a paranoid schizophrenic. The inquiry reported last week that when she went, unaccompanied, with Joseph into the hostel's isolated lounge - a room with no panic alarms and no easy escape route - she had not been told he had previously been convicted for carrying a knife, had threatened mental hospital staff and had a history of sleeping with a machete under his pillow. In addition, she was unaware that he had spoken about \"demons\" torturing him and that he had said she \"would be brave\" to see him. Within minutes of their meeting, Joseph went to the hostel kitchen, fetched a knife and stabbed her more than 100 times. There was only one member of staff, a woman, on duty at the hostel. Joseph has been convicted of manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility and sent to Broadmoor special hospital indefinitely. The independent inquiry, chaired by barrister Peter Herbert, found that the risks Joseph posed to himself and others were \"systematically underestimated\". The inquiry report criticises Wandsworth council, which runs the hostel, and the South West London and St George's mental health trust, which coordinated his care, for \"serious management and systems failures\". Morrison had planned to meet Joseph in the company of the hostel's manager and deputy manager, but had problems with her car and had to get a lift, arriving before they did. Irrespective of this, the report criticises the hostel's failure to meet Wandsworth's own minimum requirement of at least two care staff on duty at all times. In addition, it finds that inadequate, \"ad hoc\" sharing of vital information among professionals increased the likelihood of a fatality occurring. Neither Morrison nor the hostel staff were informed that Joseph had threatened his mother with a knife. Hostel staff had also not been told that he had previously been charged with possession of a kitchen knife, or that he had made threatening phone calls to two nurses at the Maudsley hospital, south London,where he had been a patient. Finally, the inquiry found there had been a three-week delay between hostel staff noticing that Joseph's behaviour had deteriorated and Morrison being informed. Joseph had become Morrison's client in 1998 when he was discharged from Springfield. In contrast to his earlier discharge from the Maudsley, he received no written care plan, no risk assessment in accordance with the care programme approach, no systematic monitoring of his medication and no out-patient follow-up. The hostel was also found to lack proper emergency procedures. The inquiry panel recommended improved hospital discharge procedures, staff training programmes, management procedures and supervision of medication. The council and the trust say they have already done much of this, but the London NHS region says it will be checking up. Herbert says the findings have national implications for mental health services. If Department of Health guidelines had been followed, there would have been less risk of a serious incident occurring.",

      "body": "<p>Aplan to open a hostel for asylum seekers has been thrown out after angry residents raised a storm of protest. They told their local council they feared that young children and elderly people would be put at risk and there would be a breakdown of law and order. The council said it understood their fears and turned down the proposal. Nobody was being racist, said councillors, but the hostel would be better placed somewhere else. </p> <p>Such episodes may not be headline news these days, but this didn't take place in a shires village or a well-heeled suburb of a commuter belt town. It happened last month in a pit village near Rotherham, in the heartland of what was once known as the Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire. The planning board of Rotherham borough council, on which Labour holds 58 of the 66 seats, refused to give the go-ahead for 30 men to be given refuge in the village of Wath upon Dearne while their applications for asylum were being processed. </p> <p>Those who remember the political action that centred on Sheffield and the nearby towns of Barnsley, Doncaster and Rotherham in the 70s and 80s may find it hard to believe that this could have happened in what was once a hotbed of socialism. After all, South Yorkshire threw open its arms to refugees from Chile who fled the Pinochet regime. Those asylum seekers - and others from across the globe - were warmly welcomed by communities throughout the county. In Sheffield, it was almost a state occasion when political activists were called to the City Hall ballroom to attend yet another welcoming party for refugees. What mattered above all else was that asylum seekers were made to feel at home. </p> <p>And at home they felt. Few Saturdays went by in South Yorkshire without a demonstration in support of some cause or other, and refugees were actively encouraged to march side by side with their new found friends. This was where the victorious miners' strikes of 1972 and 1974 were masterminded. It was here that Sheffield city council continually attempted to frustrate the Conservative government of the 80s, and the council's new leader, a youthful David Blunkett, had the red flag flown over the town hall to the annoyance of Thatcher and her ministers. </p> <p>Throughout the mines, the railways and the steel and engineering works, the socialist message rang out. Here, and overseas, fellow workers could count on the support of the rank and file in South Yorkshire. That, it seems, is no longer the way in at least one part of the \"socialist republic\". </p> <p>In October, residents of Wath upon Dearne, a former mining community on the outskirts of Rotherham, learned that a planning application had gone before the borough council to change the use of a former residential nursing home to a 30-bed hostel for asylum seekers. Rotherham businessman Terry Watson, owner of the building, had tried for more than a year to find a buyer. It had stood empty as he sought to sell it as a nursing home, flats or a hotel, but he had been unable to stimulate any interest. </p> <p>Watson had reached an agreement with Safe Haven, a not-for-profit body, backed by a group of housing associations and sponsored by the Home Office, to turn the building into a hostel for refugees catering for up to 30 single men aged 18 to 30. </p> <p>But the plan triggered an outcry among locals. Feelings ran high at public meetings. A petition, with more than 700 signatures, and numerous letters from individual residents were sent to the council demanding the scheme be thrown out. </p> <p>Residents argued that the hostel should be sited on a council estate, not in a private residential area; that there would be an increase in crime, including vandalism and \"social disorder\"; and that property prices would fall. One resident claimed that parents would be \"terrified of letting their children play out\". Another asked: \"Can we be assured there are no child abusers, drug addicts or convicted rapists among them?\" </p> <p>Only one local stood up in defiance and supported the plan. Ged Dempsey, a delegate to Rotherham trades council and a member of a number of human rights groups, called on the local authority to join with the trades council and local churches \"to assist in demystifying, informing, challenging and breaking down the barriers to the issues involved\". </p> <p>Through the trades council, Dempsey wrote to union branches and churches urging them to support his stand that asylum seekers were entitled to basic human rights and had been unjustly \"stigmatised, alienated and segregated\". He pointed out that the TUC's annual congress had agreed unanimously to defend the rights of asylum seekers. </p> <p>He was later supported by a number of churchmen. The Rev Tim Leach, of All Saints Church in the village, was one of two who attended a public meeting and spoke on behalf of accepting the refugees. He says: \"Among local residents, there were a good few who were not against the proposal. Regrettably, those who were against it were most vociferous.\" </p> <p>Rotherham's planners took everything into consideration and recommended to the planning board that the application be granted, stating: \"The premises shall be used as a hostel for asylum seekers only and for no other purpose. Asylum seekers occupying the premises shall be referred by the Home Office or local housing authority.\" But when board members started to discuss the plan, a very different view emerged. </p> <p>Labour member Sheila Walker, who chairs the board, told the meeting: \"I know what a close-knit community they are in Wath and this is not prejudice. This is nothing to do with racism. It's about whether this is the right place, and in our opinion it is not.\" Another Labour councillor, Margaret Clark, said: \"We live in a multicultural town, but some parts of Rotherham are more multicultural than others.\" </p> <p>If that was a blow to the men and women who built South Yorkshire's socialist republic, then what happened next was even worse. Moving that the plan be kicked out was Labour member and former National Union of Mineworkers stalwart Brian Walker, himself from Wath. He told the meeting: \"We have a long history of ethnic support and advice groups in the centre of Rotherham. We do not feel it would be fair to be putting them (the asylum seekers) out in Wath. Some of the asylum seekers don't want to be here. They want to be in the big cities where the jobs and the action are.\" Walker was seconded by fellow Labour member Roger Stone, a former national president of the steel union, ISTC. </p> <p>Walker and Stone: two staunch trade unionists from industries that helped breed the socialists who built South Yorkshire's reputation. Together, they led the unanimous rejection of the hostel scheme. </p> <p>The council's planners, who had supported the proposal, were sent away to draw up an explanation for the scheme's rejection. A week later, the council reported that \"the full decision is still being formulated\". Eventually, the planners announced that the hostel would \"generate an unacceptable level of perceived fear\" for local residents in an area \"characterised by family housing\" and would be \"detrimental to the general residential majority of these residents\". This, said the planners belatedly, would not conform with the town's unitary development plan. </p> <p>It was also stressed that the council considered there was a general lack of support services in the area, which would mean refugees having to travel five miles into Rotherham - a journey \"inconvenient, unsettling and unsustainable\". </p> <p>This does not stand up to scrutiny, claims Tim Fordham, of Safe Haven. He says: \"If you take the line of argument about a lack of facilities to an ultimate conclusion, you would say that any area of the country which presently has no facilities for either asylum seekers or Britain's black and ethnic community should never accommodate people from these communities. This is clearly creating exclusion zones.\" There would have been mini-buses to take the refugees into Rotherham, Fordham adds. </p> <p>Safe Haven had supplied the council with answers to all the concerns raised by local residents in the days before the planning board met. Fordham addressed councillors on the day and believes he showed there was no evidence asylum seekers helped increase the crime rate. After all, it was in a refugee's interest not to be involved in crime lest it affect the final outcome of their case. He stressed there was no evidence to suggest asylum seekers offered a particular threat to old people and young children, or that house prices would be affected. </p> <p>He had already explained in writing that Safe Haven successfully managed a number of projects housing refugees elsewhere in South Yorkshire. He told them that when a similar scheme had been proposed in the High Green district of Sheffield, itwas met with hostility from the local community, but that Safe Haven had worked with local residents and their initial fears had not been realised. </p> <p> Arthur Jepson chairs the residents' association in High Green. He admits there were fears that allowing 34 flats to be used to house asylum seekers, most of them single men, would bring trouble to the district. \"Like everyone else, we had heard bad reports, but Safe Haven reassured us that this would not be the case,\" he says. \"We trusted them and gave them our support and we now find we have a community of nice people living among us.\" </p> <p>Jepson went to speak at a public meeting in Wath to try to allay any fears and reassure the protesters that Safe Haven would manage the scheme properly. \"I got a real slating,\" he says. \"All they could say was that our community could take the refugees if that was how we felt.\" </p> <p>Wath vicar Leach believes Rotherham council should have trusted Safe Haven to manage the Wath scheme properly. \"The council should have made its decision on the merits of the application,\" he says. \"If there was a company who could manage it effectively and well, then it should have been given the chance.

      "bodyText": "Aplan to open a hostel for asylum seekers has been thrown out after angry residents raised a storm of protest. They told their local council they feared that young children and elderly people would be put at risk and there would be a breakdown of law and order. The council said it understood their fears and turned down the proposal. Nobody was being racist, said councillors, but the hostel would be better placed somewhere else. Such episodes may not be headline news these days, but this didn't take place in a shires village or a well-heeled suburb of a commuter belt town. It happened last month in a pit village near Rotherham, in the heartland of what was once known as the Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire. The planning board of Rotherham borough council, on which Labour holds 58 of the 66 seats, refused to give the go-ahead for 30 men to be given refuge in the village of Wath upon Dearne while their applications for asylum were being processed. Those who remember the political action that centred on Sheffield and the nearby towns of Barnsley, Doncaster and Rotherham in the 70s and 80s may find it hard to believe that this could have happened in what was once a hotbed of socialism. After all, South Yorkshire threw open its arms to refugees from Chile who fled the Pinochet regime. Those asylum seekers - and others from across the globe - were warmly welcomed by communities throughout the county. In Sheffield, it was almost a state occasion when political activists were called to the City Hall ballroom to attend yet another welcoming party for refugees. What mattered above all else was that asylum seekers were made to feel at home. And at home they felt. Few Saturdays went by in South Yorkshire without a demonstration in support of some cause or other, and refugees were actively encouraged to march side by side with their new found friends. This was where the victorious miners' strikes of 1972 and 1974 were masterminded. It was here that Sheffield city council continually attempted to frustrate the Conservative government of the 80s, and the council's new leader, a youthful David Blunkett, had the red flag flown over the town hall to the annoyance of Thatcher and her ministers. Throughout the mines, the railways and the steel and engineering works, the socialist message rang out. Here, and overseas, fellow workers could count on the support of the rank and file in South Yorkshire. That, it seems, is no longer the way in at least one part of the \"socialist republic\". In October, residents of Wath upon Dearne, a former mining community on the outskirts of Rotherham, learned that a planning application had gone before the borough council to change the use of a former residential nursing home to a 30-bed hostel for asylum seekers. Rotherham businessman Terry Watson, owner of the building, had tried for more than a year to find a buyer. It had stood empty as he sought to sell it as a nursing home, flats or a hotel, but he had been unable to stimulate any interest. Watson had reached an agreement with Safe Haven, a not-for-profit body, backed by a group of housing associations and sponsored by the Home Office, to turn the building into a hostel for refugees catering for up to 30 single men aged 18 to 30. But the plan triggered an outcry among locals. Feelings ran high at public meetings. A petition, with more than 700 signatures, and numerous letters from individual residents were sent to the council demanding the scheme be thrown out. Residents argued that the hostel should be sited on a council estate, not in a private residential area; that there would be an increase in crime, including vandalism and \"social disorder\"; and that property prices would fall. One resident claimed that parents would be \"terrified of letting their children play out\". Another asked: \"Can we be assured there are no child abusers, drug addicts or convicted rapists among them?\" Only one local stood up in defiance and supported the plan. Ged Dempsey, a delegate to Rotherham trades council and a member of a number of human rights groups, called on the local authority to join with the trades council and local churches \"to assist in demystifying, informing, challenging and breaking down the barriers to the issues involved\". Through the trades council, Dempsey wrote to union branches and churches urging them to support his stand that asylum seekers were entitled to basic human rights and had been unjustly \"stigmatised, alienated and segregated\". He pointed out that the TUC's annual congress had agreed unanimously to defend the rights of asylum seekers. He was later supported by a number of churchmen. The Rev Tim Leach, of All Saints Church in the village, was one of two who attended a public meeting and spoke on behalf of accepting the refugees. He says: \"Among local residents, there were a good few who were not against the proposal. Regrettably, those who were against it were most vociferous.\" Rotherham's planners took everything into consideration and recommended to the planning board that the application be granted, stating: \"The premises shall be used as a hostel for asylum seekers only and for no other purpose. Asylum seekers occupying the premises shall be referred by the Home Office or local housing authority.\" But when board members started to discuss the plan, a very different view emerged. Labour member Sheila Walker, who chairs the board, told the meeting: \"I know what a close-knit community they are in Wath and this is not prejudice. This is nothing to do with racism. It's about whether this is the right place, and in our opinion it is not.\" Another Labour councillor, Margaret Clark, said: \"We live in a multicultural town, but some parts of Rotherham are more multicultural than others.\" If that was a blow to the men and women who built South Yorkshire's socialist republic, then what happened next was even worse. Moving that the plan be kicked out was Labour member and former National Union of Mineworkers stalwart Brian Walker, himself from Wath. He told the meeting: \"We have a long history of ethnic support and advice groups in the centre of Rotherham. We do not feel it would be fair to be putting them (the asylum seekers) out in Wath. Some of the asylum seekers don't want to be here. They want to be in the big cities where the jobs and the action are.\" Walker was seconded by fellow Labour member Roger Stone, a former national president of the steel union, ISTC. Walker and Stone: two staunch trade unionists from industries that helped breed the socialists who built South Yorkshire's reputation. Together, they led the unanimous rejection of the hostel scheme. The council's planners, who had supported the proposal, were sent away to draw up an explanation for the scheme's rejection. A week later, the council reported that \"the full decision is still being formulated\". Eventually, the planners announced that the hostel would \"generate an unacceptable level of perceived fear\" for local residents in an area \"characterised by family housing\" and would be \"detrimental to the general residential majority of these residents\". This, said the planners belatedly, would not conform with the town's unitary development plan. It was also stressed that the council considered there was a general lack of support services in the area, which would mean refugees having to travel five miles into Rotherham - a journey \"inconvenient, unsettling and unsustainable\". This does not stand up to scrutiny, claims Tim Fordham, of Safe Haven. He says: \"If you take the line of argument about a lack of facilities to an ultimate conclusion, you would say that any area of the country which presently has no facilities for either asylum seekers or Britain's black and ethnic community should never accommodate people from these communities. This is clearly creating exclusion zones.\" There would have been mini-buses to take the refugees into Rotherham, Fordham adds. Safe Haven had supplied the council with answers to all the concerns raised by local residents in the days before the planning board met. Fordham addressed councillors on the day and believes he showed there was no evidence asylum seekers helped increase the crime rate. After all, it was in a refugee's interest not to be involved in crime lest it affect the final outcome of their case. He stressed there was no evidence to suggest asylum seekers offered a particular threat to old people and young children, or that house prices would be affected. He had already explained in writing that Safe Haven successfully managed a number of projects housing refugees elsewhere in South Yorkshire. He told them that when a similar scheme had been proposed in the High Green district of Sheffield, itwas met with hostility from the local community, but that Safe Haven had worked with local residents and their initial fears had not been realised. Arthur Jepson chairs the residents' association in High Green. He admits there were fears that allowing 34 flats to be used to house asylum seekers, most of them single men, would bring trouble to the district. \"Like everyone else, we had heard bad reports, but Safe Haven reassured us that this would not be the case,\" he says. \"We trusted them and gave them our support and we now find we have a community of nice people living among us.\" Jepson went to speak at a public meeting in Wath to try to allay any fears and reassure the protesters that Safe Haven would manage the scheme properly. \"I got a real slating,\" he says. \"All they could say was that our community could take the refugees if that was how we felt.\" Wath vicar Leach believes Rotherham council should have trusted Safe Haven to manage the Wath scheme properly. \"The council should have made its decision on the merits of the application,\" he says. \"If there was a company who could manage it effectively and well, then it should have been given the chance. It seems Safe Haven was that company.\" Safe Haven, which is considering an appeal, has accused the council of taking a decision \"based on prejudice rather than on planning guidance\". Dempsey echoes this. \"What the councillors did goes against everything that has been said nationally by both the Labour party and the TUC. They are not respecting socialist values,\" he says. \"The decision reeks of discrimination and intolerance when we in South Yorkshire have been in the forefront of the fight against injustice and prejudice through generation after generation. It's a very sad day indeed.\"",

Reporting profits up 20% in the past six months, chief executive Aubrey Allen said the lull in the property market seen in the summer had ended and business was now \"very active\". He said London prices had been moving up in the past couple of months and the outlook for the new year - as City bankers walk away with record bonuses - was very positive. Many of the huge City payouts - one investment bank alone is handing out more than 50 \u00a31m cheques this month - will be directed straight into new property. \"It is wonderful for us,\" Mr Allen said. \"It is music to our ears. We almost want to start phoning them up. \"There are literally people walking through the door and saying 'I've got another \u00a3100,000 to spend'.\" Savills' own staff might soon be joining their ranks. The agency operates its own bonus system for which the payout date has been brought forward from April to December. Last year the group's top earner banked a \u00a3600,000 bonus and Mr Allen said this year looked \"pretty good\" too. He estimated that around 100 staff would receive bonuses of between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3150,000. Savills' turnover in the six months to the end of October was up 71% and profits climbed from \u00a38.8m to \u00a310.6m. Richard Jewson, the chairman, said the group was trading strongly but sounded a warning that nervous stock markets could test confidence. The shares closed unchanged at 218.5p.",

But by 1998/99, student debt had soared to \u00a32,473 a year.</p> <p>Students leaving university after a three-year course can now expect to have debts of around \u00a37,500.</p> <p>The report also found that 87% of students now say they experience financial hardship. Some 60% of students said money problems had negatively affected their academic performance. More worryingly, 61% said the funding system had deterred their friends from going to university, especially black students, women over 25, and those from poorer backgrounds.</p> <p>Tuition fees are seen as the major factor in increasing costs for students since 1996, with 35% paying the full \u00a31,000 towards their fees and 21% paying some of the fees.</p> <p>Owain James, NUS national president, said: \"The DfEE's own Student Income and Expenditure survey is a damning indictment of the government's student funding system. Their figures show student hardship is widespread. But this survey was carried out before the abolition of the maintenance grant in England and Wales, so the picture today is likely to be much worse. </p> <p>\"What more evidence does the government need? The Scottish parliament has rejected their funding system. In England, applications from poorer students have fallen. The government must act now to return maintenance grants to those from the poorest backgrounds, as received by Scottish students.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the government welcomed the figures as evidence that most higher education students received enough financial support to meet their essential costs.</p> <p>Education and Employment minister Tessa Blackstone said: \"The survey evidence confirms that the great majority of full-time students are taking out new fairer income loans which are interest-free in real terms with repayment linked to income. Students are generally receiving the support they need from loans, grants and contributions from their parents, but we recognise that further, targeted support is needed for some disadvantaged groups.\"</p> <p>This targeted help is to include, amongst other things, mature student bursaries and childcare grants to help out lone parents, identified as the highest debt group with an average debt of \u00a34,747 a year. </p> <p><strong>Useful link</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.moneyunlimited.co.uk/advicebank/financeyourstudentyears/0,6450,332023,00.html\">Finance your student years</a><br> Visit our advice bank section for help in sorting out your student finance</p>",

But by 1998/99, student debt had soared to \u00a32,473 a year. Students leaving university after a three-year course can now expect to have debts of around \u00a37,500. The report also found that 87% of students now say they experience financial hardship. Some 60% of students said money problems had negatively affected their academic performance. More worryingly, 61% said the funding system had deterred their friends from going to university, especially black students, women over 25, and those from poorer backgrounds. Tuition fees are seen as the major factor in increasing costs for students since 1996, with 35% paying the full \u00a31,000 towards their fees and 21% paying some of the fees. Owain James, NUS national president, said: \"The DfEE's own Student Income and Expenditure survey is a damning indictment of the government's student funding system. Their figures show student hardship is widespread. But this survey was carried out before the abolition of the maintenance grant in England and Wales, so the picture today is likely to be much worse. \"What more evidence does the government need? The Scottish parliament has rejected their funding system. In England, applications from poorer students have fallen. The government must act now to return maintenance grants to those from the poorest backgrounds, as received by Scottish students.\" Meanwhile, the government welcomed the figures as evidence that most higher education students received enough financial support to meet their essential costs. Education and Employment minister Tessa Blackstone said: \"The survey evidence confirms that the great majority of full-time students are taking out new fairer income loans which are interest-free in real terms with repayment linked to income. Students are generally receiving the support they need from loans, grants and contributions from their parents, but we recognise that further, targeted support is needed for some disadvantaged groups.\" This targeted help is to include, amongst other things, mature student bursaries and childcare grants to help out lone parents, identified as the highest debt group with an average debt of \u00a34,747 a year.
