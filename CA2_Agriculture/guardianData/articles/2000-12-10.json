      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown yesterday signalled future tax cuts for families as he promised a children's tax credit worth up to 2.5 per cent off the basic rate in the run-up to the election. In a speech designed to pep up Labour activists ahead of the campaign, the Chancellor said he would offer a more generous than expected \u00a310-a-week tax credit - cash back in the pay packet - targeted at lower-income parents. But he left the way clear for further generosity in what will be a highly political Budget just before the Government goes to the polls. Brown's speech will be seen as a response to the aggressive Tory tax-cutting agenda outlined over the last few weeks, attempting to position Labour as the party that can offer the most robustly calculated and wisely targeted cuts. His speech made clear that tax and spending will be the key battleground of the election campaign. Labour's manifesto would be based on a theme of prosperity for all, compared to 'irresponsible' offers of Tory cuts. 'So in future budgets tax cuts will be targeted on the priorities: work, families, savings and investment - helping pensioners such as our pensions credit - and the environment,' he said. 'But we will not go along with irresponsible or indiscriminate cuts that undermine our stability, irresponsible tax promises that risk repeating 1992 - where tax cuts before the election lead to public spending cuts and rises just after.' His criticisms were rubbished by the Tories however who said that after raising 'stealth taxes' worth up to 10p in the pound it was surprising Brown 'had the gall to start talking about tax cuts'. 'In the last three-and-a-half years they have put taxes up by stealth to the equivalent of almost 10p in the pound, hitting hard-working families hardest,' a Tory spokeswoman said. 'Now, in the final months before the election, they have the gall to start talking about tax cuts. No one will believe Labour's promises second time around.' Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Matthew Taylor said poorest families were paying more under Labour. 'The rich have benefited from tax cuts while pensioners, schools and the health service have gone without,' he said. 'Liberal Democrat priorities are to help poorer families by cutting tax on people with low incomes.' Privately senior Labour ministers have been worried that complacency among their supporters, who believe the Government has the election in the bag, could cost them dear next spring. Brown's speech, along with a similar address from Peter Mandelson, expected to warn of the dangers of voters switching off, was designed to galvanise the party into action. Meanwhile, the Tories will tomorrow signal a retreat on plans for housing benefit reform with a plan to save \u00a3475m on the welfare bill. Failing councils who cannot reduce fraud and error in housing benefit would be stripped of their powers to deliver it, with the national Benefits Agency stepping in, Shadow Social Security Secretary David Willetts will say. Previously the Tories had wanted the entire payment centralised but gave up on that as too draconian. The changes are viewed as a first step to reforms which could tighten eligibility for the benefit, reducing payments to some claimants. Cash saved would be added to the Tories' target of saving \u00a38bn on spending to give back in tax cuts.",

The RUC and Republican Socialists believe PIRA members murdered Trevor Kell in north Belfast last Tuesday evening. His death provoked the Ulster Defence Association - which, like the PIRA, is officially on ceasefire - to murder one Catholic and wound another in retaliation. If the PIRA unit did carry out the Kell killing, it will represent a serious challenge to Adams and the other leader of the republican movement, Martin McGuinness. The killing means that either there is a fresh split within the PIRA, or that someone in the organisation's leadership sanctioned the murder to thwart moves to extend the arms decommissioning process. Both dissident republican groupings - the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA - have denied any involvement in the Kell murder. Initial ballistic reports on the weapon used to kill the taxi driver, who had been lured to a house in the Protestant Ardoyne area, indicate a link with a gun the PIRA fired at two police officers in Co Armagh in June 1997. The PIRA's North Armagh Brigade used that weapon to kill constables John Graham and Derrick Johnston only weeks before its second ceasefire, in July 1997. The evidence pointing to PIRA involvement in the Kell murder comes only days before Bill Clinton's final visit to Ireland as President. The Irish and British governments had hoped to have a formula in place which could have broken political deadlock in Ulster during the President's trip. However, Irish government sources indicated last night that there was only a slim chance of a deal being done between the Northern Ireland parties before the presidential jet, Airforce One, touched down in Dublin on Tuesday. The Kell murder and the subsequent killing of Catholic workman Gary Moore, along with the attempted assassination of a Catholic taxi driver, create further complications in this difficult stage of the peace process. Sinn Fein's Gerry Kelly still insists that anti-ceasefire loyalist terrorists murdered Kell to try to provoke fellow loyalists to break their ceasefires and thus destabilise the process. But the RUC's chief constable, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, has blamed Republicans for killing Kell, although he refused to name the organisation responsible. The Continuity IRA yesterday publicly denied any involvement. A coded statement said its leadership was 'adamant that none of our units were involved'. It added: 'We would not willingly get involved in tit-for-tat sectarian conflict.' The Real IRA also rejected speculation that its members were behind Tuesday night's murder.

      "body": "<p>America's highest court yesterday intervened dramatically in the increasingly chaotic presidential election when it ordered a halt to the manual recount of votes in Florida.</p> <p>The US Supreme Court appeared to have swung the advantage away from Vice-President Al Gore just hours after tellers had begun recounting the votes that could have given him victory.</p> <p>The Supreme Court order stopped the recount until fresh hearings on Monday. However, the delay could be decisive for George W. Bush in a race in which time is becoming increasingly critical.</p> <p>The recount of 'undervotes' - those not registered by machine count - had been set in motion at 9.50am in Leon County's concrete and glass library at Tallahassee.</p> <p>Republican and Democratic observers, flown in overnight, were sworn in and looked on as a panel of eight judges, working around four white Formica tables, picked up the first ballots from Miami and stared at the now familiar lines of holes, dimples and chads.</p> <p>This had been the moment Gore was waiting for: the votes include 9,000 cast in Miami. On Friday the Florida Supreme Court, in ordering the recount sought by Gore, had whittled Bush's lead to just 193 votes out of roughly six million cast statewide.</p> <p>By mid-day yesterday, Gore had gained a net four votes on his rival, based on the first, partial returns from Orange County.</p> <p>The tally had developed into a frantic race against time, with a deadline imposed by Leon County court - assigned to manage the count - of 2pm today.</p> <p>Last night's dramatic intervention by the Supreme Court in Washington came after lawyers for Bush lodged an appeal. They also applied to the Federal Court of Appeals in Atlanta.</p> <p>The Atlanta court had been petitioned to stop the counts before they even began. But the judges allowed it to continue, adding the rider that the new tallies could not be certified unless the US Supreme Court so determined. Later the Washington court halted the count altogether. Friday's decision by the Florida Supreme Court, by 4-3 to order the recount, had been a punch in the windpipe for Bush, who had been due to fly to Washington tomorrow, start naming his Cabinet and meet President Clinton.</p> <p>The hand count applied to a total of 43,852 votes across Florida - way beyond what Gore's lawyers were asking. But other counties had been making a slower start yesterday - some with logistical problems, others delayed by political reluctance to comply with the order to count, handed down by the Florida Supreme Court.</p> <p>The logistical nightmare imposed by the deadline emerged as baffled officials across Florida gathered to begin the count. In most places, 'undervotes' - unlike Miami's, which have been separated - are mixed in with hundreds of thousands of others.</p> <p>The hurdles focused on Duval County, which incorporates the metropolis of Jacksonville - already under the spotlight of controversy after African-American voters accused the all-Republican electoral board of discrimination and mass disenfranchisement.</p> <p>Duval has to count 4,967 'undervotes', but they are mixed in with 291,000 others, boxed in a vault.

      "bodyText": "America's highest court yesterday intervened dramatically in the increasingly chaotic presidential election when it ordered a halt to the manual recount of votes in Florida. The US Supreme Court appeared to have swung the advantage away from Vice-President Al Gore just hours after tellers had begun recounting the votes that could have given him victory. The Supreme Court order stopped the recount until fresh hearings on Monday. However, the delay could be decisive for George W. Bush in a race in which time is becoming increasingly critical. The recount of 'undervotes' - those not registered by machine count - had been set in motion at 9.50am in Leon County's concrete and glass library at Tallahassee. Republican and Democratic observers, flown in overnight, were sworn in and looked on as a panel of eight judges, working around four white Formica tables, picked up the first ballots from Miami and stared at the now familiar lines of holes, dimples and chads. This had been the moment Gore was waiting for: the votes include 9,000 cast in Miami. On Friday the Florida Supreme Court, in ordering the recount sought by Gore, had whittled Bush's lead to just 193 votes out of roughly six million cast statewide. By mid-day yesterday, Gore had gained a net four votes on his rival, based on the first, partial returns from Orange County. The tally had developed into a frantic race against time, with a deadline imposed by Leon County court - assigned to manage the count - of 2pm today. Last night's dramatic intervention by the Supreme Court in Washington came after lawyers for Bush lodged an appeal. They also applied to the Federal Court of Appeals in Atlanta. The Atlanta court had been petitioned to stop the counts before they even began. But the judges allowed it to continue, adding the rider that the new tallies could not be certified unless the US Supreme Court so determined. Later the Washington court halted the count altogether. Friday's decision by the Florida Supreme Court, by 4-3 to order the recount, had been a punch in the windpipe for Bush, who had been due to fly to Washington tomorrow, start naming his Cabinet and meet President Clinton. The hand count applied to a total of 43,852 votes across Florida - way beyond what Gore's lawyers were asking. But other counties had been making a slower start yesterday - some with logistical problems, others delayed by political reluctance to comply with the order to count, handed down by the Florida Supreme Court. The logistical nightmare imposed by the deadline emerged as baffled officials across Florida gathered to begin the count. In most places, 'undervotes' - unlike Miami's, which have been separated - are mixed in with hundreds of thousands of others. The hurdles focused on Duval County, which incorporates the metropolis of Jacksonville - already under the spotlight of controversy after African-American voters accused the all-Republican electoral board of discrimination and mass disenfranchisement. Duval has to count 4,967 'undervotes', but they are mixed in with 291,000 others, boxed in a vault. The computer software that sorts the votes was flown from Miami early yesterday, to kickstart counting in Duval and elsewhere. However, a session of the all-Republican Duval board was broadcast on national television, showed officials deliberating with such painstaking reluctance to proceed, it amounted to an effective filibuster. Bobby Burchfield, a Republican lawyer monitoring the Miami count, argued that there were no clear standards. 'It seems to me fundamental that we should have the right to object,' he said outside the library. But, he promised: 'We're not going to disrupt the proceedings.' Jenny Backus, a Democratic spokeswoman, cast doubt on the Republicans' motives. 'What we've heard is that they're going to try to slow this down by every means they can.' The Miami count, however, would be over by the end of yesterday, said Dave Lang, clerk of Leon County courts. As the majority of the disputed ballots were from Democratic precincts in Miami-Dade County, the recount in the library could have pushed Mr Gore into the lead for the first time since election day. Republicans had kept up their attacks on the process, only allowed to register written challenges ballot by ballot, while Democrats had exuded nervous exhilaration, lest a call from the federal courts came.",

But last week, though the case went against her, she made legal history.</p> <p>Five judges from England and Scotland sitting on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ruled that when police that night asked her whether she was the driver of the car in question, they did not infringe the European Convention on Human Rights, now enshrined in domestic law.</p> <p>And the judges used this new judicial machinery to settle promptly an issue that had threatened to bring chaos to the prosecution of drink driving offences throughout the United Kingdom.</p> <p>With the approach of Christmas their ruling was welcomed by police and road safety organisations.

It also hears appeals from professionals such as doctors or dentists convicted of misconduct.</p> <p>But the late Donald Dewar saw the need to make sure that devolution did not produce quixotic results in various parts of the UK. Last year the committee began to emerge as an incipient UK constitutional court to regulate the relationship between Westminster and the new legislative bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. So far it has been concerned with cases arising under the convention, by which the Scottish Parliament and Executive have been bound since their inception last year. The convention became part of UK law in October under the Human Rights Act.</p> <p>Last week the five judges unanimously found that Miss Brown's right to a fair trial under the convention had not been compromised by the question about who was driving the car which the police had asked her under section 172(2)(a) of the Road Traffic Act 1988. They thus rejected the view of the High Court in Scotland that her answer - 'it was me' - was self-incriminating.</p> <p>Lord Bingham, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, said there had to be a fair balance between the general interests of the community - which justified measures against drinking and driving - and the personal rights of the individual.</p> <p>The judges also settled a question debated in previous cases. They confirmed that the Lord Advocate's actions as public prosecutor and a member of the Scottish Executive could raise 'devolution issues'.</p> <p>These are acts of the Scottish Parliament or the Executive which can be tested in court if their competency under statute or their compliance with the convention are in doubt.</p> <p>Last week, as staff restored the peers' chamber to normal after the state opening of Parliament, Lord Hope of Craighead, who delivered one of the leading judgments in the case of Brown, explained that while the Privy Council's ruling was not necessarily final - it could be challenged either in London or Strasbourg - it would be influential.</p> <p>In previous cases the English judges on the Privy Council have been reluctant to recognise 'devolution issues', probably from a reluctance to interfere in the processes of Scottish criminal law.</p> <p>But the case of Miss Brown has changed their view.

Now there was a route of appeal, over 'devolution issues' only, to the Privy Council.</p> <p>Although it was, he conceded, a 'slightly odd arrangement', the Privy Council had several advantages. It wasn't part of Westminster and its judges didn't have to be from the House of Lords but could come from a wider pool of senior figures from UK courts.</p> <p>'It's also possible for the Judicial Committee to move around in a way the House of Lords can't really do. It is in theory possible for the Privy Council to hear cases in Edinburgh, Cardiff or Belfast.'</p> <p>He continued: 'There's a feeling that, given that we can actually find time to do it, we'd quite like to be able to be seen to be participating in our function more visibly to the public.'</p> <p>In practice, though, the judges who sat on the Privy Council were mainly judges who sat in the House of Lords. 'That may seem a bit of a charade, really, just as if you were changing your hat by moving from one place to another, but it has an advantage that one wants if possible to avoid a disagreement between the House of Lords in English cases and the Privy Council sitting in Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish cases.'</p> <p>The case of Brown, he said, showed that a definitive judgment could be achieved more quickly than by taking the case through the judicial processes of each country.</p> <p>'It's a matter of equal concern north and south of the border as to what the position is under human rights if somebody's asked by a police officer to name the driver of the motor car,' he said.</p> <p>The Privy Council verdict was open to challenge, either in the Court of Appeal in England, the House of Lords or by individual petition to Strasbourg. But he continued: 'I suspect that there will be fairly strong feeling in the Court of Appeal in England, which I can't speak for, not to grant leave to appeal to the House of Lords against their decision in view of the fact that the Privy Council has already reached a decision ... They would have to persuade the appeal committee in the House of Lords that there was still a point left to be argued.'</p> <p>As for Strasbourg, he said: 'We've yet to find out what the result would be when the Strasbourg court places greater weight on views brought to bear by the judges of the highest level in this country. What we've tried to do is understand the Strasbourg jurisprudence. We believe that the decision in Brown is consistent with the Strasbourg jurisprudence and therefore would survive challenge. But in theory that route is open.'</p> <p>Early next year the Privy Council will hear a case arising from the conviction at Paisley in June last year of Robert McIntosh for drug trafficking. The prosecutor then applied for an order under the Misuse of Drugs Act confiscating his assets. The High Court in Scotland found that this violated McIntosh's right, under the convention, to a presumption of innocence.</p> <p>This case, too, said Lord Hope last week, not only involved a matter of concern on both sides of the border but also an issue reserved to Westminster. It had been dealt with in Scotland before England because the devolution legislation took effect before the Human Rights Act. The appeal to the Privy Council would be heard before an appeal could reach the House of Lords from the Court of Appeal.</p> <p>He continued: 'So again the Scottish position is being used as a test-bed to decide the issue on both sides of the border.'</p> <p>However, Lord Hope is anxious that the Privy Council should not become involved in pronouncing on Scottish criminal law or criminal practice.

Lord Hope said: 'I think one might almost say that the scales fell from the eyes of the judges when they realised that the system we'd been given is a very efficient one for dealing with [certain] problems in the quickest and most economical way possible.'

'That may seem a bit of a charade, really, just as if you were changing your hat by moving from one place to another, but it has an advantage that one wants if possible to avoid a disagreement between the House of Lords in English cases and the Privy Council sitting in Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish cases.' The case of Brown, he said, showed that a definitive judgment could be achieved more quickly than by taking the case through the judicial processes of each country. 'It's a matter of equal concern north and south of the border as to what the position is under human rights if somebody's asked by a police officer to name the driver of the motor car,' he said. The Privy Council verdict was open to challenge, either in the Court of Appeal in England, the House of Lords or by individual petition to Strasbourg. But he continued: 'I suspect that there will be fairly strong feeling in the Court of Appeal in England, which I can't speak for, not to grant leave to appeal to the House of Lords against their decision in view of the fact that the Privy Council has already reached a decision ...

This case, too, said Lord Hope last week, not only involved a matter of concern on both sides of the border but also an issue reserved to Westminster. It had been dealt with in Scotland before England because the devolution legislation took effect before the Human Rights Act. The appeal to the Privy Council would be heard before an appeal could reach the House of Lords from the Court of Appeal. He continued: 'So again the Scottish position is being used as a test-bed to decide the issue on both sides of the border.' However, Lord Hope is anxious that the Privy Council should not become involved in pronouncing on Scottish criminal law or criminal practice. Its strength was that it had been able to develop its own system without English influence. He said: 'I see a great deal of English law as operated in the Caribbean and my own preference is that we adhere to our own practices and our own law. It's a very fine line between dealing with a strict devolution issue point and becoming involved in Scottish criminal practice or Scottish substantive criminal law.' During the devolution debates in 1998 Lord Hope expressed anxieties that the Scottish public, in their enthusiasm for devolution, did not understand that the new parliament would not be sovereign, like Westminster, but open to review. Last week he said: 'You may remember that Tony Blair said in an unguarded moment that the powers were similar to those of a parish council, and that caused a lot of unease. Technically there was quite a lot in what he said.' But, he stressed, it was Westminster which was 'the odd one out'. The typical position in Europe and the Commonwealth was that parliaments were subject to review. 'Scotland has moved, as it were, into the 21st century by having a parliament which is the same as everywhere else in the world.' The devolution settlement had produced a lopsided result. England was a uniform country with no attempt to divide it into regions. 'And then you have Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland with a devolution system and a uniform appeals structure.' He added: 'To that extent, in a loose sense, you might say that the Privy Council is a kind of constitutional court, although we're again a long way from a typical constitutional court.' Lord Hope, the former Lord President who was appointed a Lord in Ordinary in 1996, expected the number of human rights cases would eventually fall after the 'initial wave' had passed. But he continued: 'If one finds that the government changes or the political complexion alters a bit, one may find a greater tension between Edinburgh and Westminster than exists at the moment. It's just possible that there may be a greater inclination by Westminster to challenge things done at Edinburgh and the avenue for doing that is through the Privy Council.'

      "body": "<p>He was a studious boy, observant of the Bible and so quiet that bullies used to pick on him at school. His mother brought him from Lagos in Nigeria to London in search of a decent education and a better life. That bright future expired in a dank block of flats in Peckham, where he was found, a few yards from home, dying of a stab wound. This is not Damilola Taylor but Shola Agoro, who was killed nine days previously and a few hundred yards away from the grubby stairwell where Damilola perished.</p> <p>No Government Ministers offered outrage or regret. No bewildered strangers dropped flowers where Shola fell. No closed-circuit cameras captured his last steps. 'He was my angel, my baby, my best friend,' his mother said, but few outside her family were invited to share her grief. The death of Shola Agoro went almost unremarked. Publicity, or lack of it, aside, there were only two variants in the parallel lives and fates of the two boys. Police have charged a youth with Shola's murder while no suspects have been traced in connection with Damilola's stabbing.</p> <p>But the real difference was one of age. Damilola was 10. Shola was 17; too young to vote, too young to have completed his engineering diploma, but old enough to become one more statistic in a litany of violence in a place where the stabbing of young men is too humdrum to register on the Richter scale of public shock.</p> <p>Of course, the murder of a 10-year-old is especially horrific. The dignity, the tears and the televised mourning of Damilola's family at his memorial service last week provoked a tide of sympathy and collective guilt. Beforehand, journalists made their pilgrimage to his home in Lagos and discovered, in sand streets where chickens scratched and children trekked to spartan classrooms, the seeds of what British society has supposedly squandered. This was a place where family values counted for something, reported those too moved by the lure of simplicity and communalism to note the corruption, the exponential rise in armed robbery or the fact that almost five murders a day are logged in a city where crime goes largely unreported and those who escape violence are likely to die of natural causes before they reach 50.</p> <p>And besides, look what miracles a rich society can perform for children. The most compelling portrait of last week was the dimpled infant fist of Jodie, the surviving conjoined twin, clamped round her father's finger. Here was an emblem of Britain's ability to marshal medical science and judicial wisdom to secure a child's life. How everyone loves a fairy-tale ending. And how quickly they forget that only weeks have passed since the Roman Catholic Church and assorted doctors and commentators clamoured that Jodie should, in the name of morality or humanity, be left to die.</p> <p>If her case reeks of ambivalence, then so does our attitude to children in general. We hype up the terror of murderers and abusers, rarely seeing how good intentions blur into mawkish sentiment and hysteria. Anyone in doubt over the prevalence of sex abuse in care homes and outside should reread Sir William Utting's damning report in 1997. Three years on, David Jones, a former football manager and care worker, is acquitted of abuse in a case that exposed the flaws of police work and the CPS. A dead priest is accused of paedophilia in a media storm in which evidence of culpability is secondary to the piquancy of the fact that he worked at the school attended by the Prime Minister's sons.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the NSPCC becomes the National Society For The Protection Of Corporate Culture. Its annual report suggested (a conclusion the charity disputes) that pen-pushers and advertisers fared better from its beneficence than abused children. The current appetite for naming, shaming and incarcerating for ever the armies of paedophiles perceived to be preying on our kids is not a spur to action. Screeches for something to be done merely occlude the suspicion that vast amounts of money are being spent on not doing it.</p> <p>But the real contradiction over how children are supported and protected resides with government. In several ways, Labour has had a good week. Stephen Byers' Green Paper on working parents finally acknowledges that babies do better if their parents get enough time off. Two weeks paid paternity leave and an increase in statutory maternity pay from \u00a360.20 to \u00a3100 a week, with the option of an extension of leave for a year, remains Scrooge-like by the standards of Paris or Stockholm. It is, however, a nod in the right direction.</p> <p>So is Tessa Jowell's explosion of the 'marriage-is-best' strategy. She doesn't want a family policy that makes 'some children feel they are first-class and others second-class'. All must be equally valued, cherished and made to feel worthy as long as their childhood endures. The pity is that others in Government set such a short expiry date. When do children stop being the potential prey of monsters and emerge as aggressors in their own right? Around the age of Damilola Taylor, according to the rules of matriculation into Jack Straw's yob culture.</p> <p>Henceforth, those between 10 and 13 found loitering after 10pm may be removed under curfew orders designed to underpin the Home Secretary's dislike of under-16s 'racketing' round the streets. That is what most teenagers do. But it will not be your child, or mine, who is delivered in a police van after being intercepted on a ramble home from a party. Given the police's lukewarm response, it may not be anyone's child. That does not diminish the Alice-in- Wonderland perversity of a policy that criminalises non-offending children in the hope of decriminalising them. There are more effective, quieter initiatives in place for turning children away from violence, but pointless, harmful measures supposedly play better to the mood decreeing that family breakdown inevitably breeds trainee 'yobs'.</p> <p>Of course there is a link between poverty and bad parenting and crime. But to wish to feed a criminal underclass with a Government-created army of mini-conscripts is as absurd as the idea that sober, Christian, family values are a guarantor of perfect outcomes. If they had been observed, then Jodie, now a symbol of survival in a toy-packed cot, would be dying or dead.</p> <p>But that is history now. So, soon, will be the brief flurry of national mourning for Damilola; a mood awkwardly rooted in comfort as well as in grief. The murder of a 10-year-old remains a rare aberration. So does the threat of the paedophile-at-large, but how much easier it is to deal with horrors unlikely to befall our children rather than to confront the fact that the vast majority of victims are other people's children assaulted by one of their own family in their own homes. As for Shola Agoro, still only a child at 17, he will remain one crime statistic among many. Too young to die, too old for martyrdom, his memory will be unruffled by hot gusts of public emotion and political posturing on solutions for a violent society. In the absence of easy answers, it is safe only to assume that the real problem centres not on those we vow to remember but on those whom we choose to forget.</p> <p><b>Related special report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/crime/\" target=\"_new\">Policing crime</a><br> <b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,404947,00.html\">30 November: Straw appeals to public after 'evil' schoolboy murder</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,404836,00.html\">30 November: 'My son is dead and I am bitter'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/leaders/story/0,3604,404700,00.html\">30 November, leader: Death in Peckham</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,404901,00.html\">30 November: Head defends bullying record</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/crime/article/0,2763,404903,00.html\">30 November: Estate is 'one of toughest in Europe'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,404333,00.html\">29 November: Death of a schoolboy</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4097793,00.html\">29 November: It's lawless out there</a><br><br><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Metropolitan police</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">The home office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/100/100821.pdf\" target=\"_new\">Ofsted report: the Oliver Goldsmith primary school</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.southlondononline.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Local media: South London online</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.southwark.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">London borough of Southwark</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.thereal.com/o-041798.html\" target=\"_new\">Photographs of the North Peckham estate</a></p>",

Portugal led a furious group of nations who claim they have been 'humiliated' by a decision to change the balance of power in favour of the five larger nations - Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Spain. A plan put forward by the French tripled the number of votes given to the big five while only doubling the votes given to smaller nations.

      "body": "<p>A globetrotting young woman who wields increasing power over the President of the United States will cross on to British soil from Ireland on Wednesday, one of three generations of women accompanying Bill Clinton on the last trip of his presidency.</p> <p>At her side will be a sprightly octogenarian, her grandmother - also a cogent influence on the US President and his legacy in the twilight of his office. The third woman will be the link between them: the senator for New York, who took her seat on Capitol Hill last week. They are Dorothy Rodham, her daughter Hillary and 20-year-old Chelsea.</p> <p>As the curtain descends on his presidency, Clinton already has one foot in the shadows as Hillary makes history and Chelsea emerges as a quiet power in her own right, after years of protected and protective seclusion.</p> <p>Chelsea has bloomed from a gawkish, frizzy-headed 12-year-old into a poised and independent young woman who posits vegetarianism against her father's taste for Big Macs.</p> <p>She has undergone a sea change in her ambitions - from the long-proclaimed profession of medicine to the family business of politics. As many interview requests for Chelsea as for the President now arrive at the White House (the answer is always no). And, like her father, she wants to go to Oxford.</p> <p>The other relative stranger in the formidable female trio is the President's mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham. For of all the places that Bill Clinton could go when he faces his identity crisis next January as the youngest former President (there's been much talk of Hollywood and Manhattan), he has chosen to stay with his mother-in-law down in Little Rock, Arkansas, where it all began.</p> <p>At Dorothy's condo in Hillcrest Heights, tucked among the cliffs that plunge into the Arkansas River, there's always an easy chair for Bill. 'I really like her,' explains the President. 'We really get along.'</p> <p>In Chelsea, Britain will get a close-up of a young woman steeled for the rigours of public life since the age of six. When her father was running for the governorship of Arkansas, Hillary told her daughter that people might one day say nasty things about Pop which were not true.</p> <p>There have been two very different moments when Chelsea stole the limelight from her parents. The first came during the summer horribilis of 1998, at the height of the Lewinsky scandal. After the President's trial by television, the Clinton trio took its longest walk across the South lawn towards an awaiting helicopter; Chelsea was a firewall wedged between her parents, part peacemaker, part victim.</p> <p>Chelsea's second moment came this autumn, during what is universally regarded as the proto-perfect political campaign her mother waged for the New York Senate seat.</p> <p>'A pleasure to meet you,' grinned Chelsea to the phalanx of cameras that turned away from their usual target, Hillary, to focus on the 20-year old - looking relaxed and the spitting image of her father.</p> <p>Although she had been at her father's side during the campaigns of 1992 and 1996, this was Chelsea's coming-out moment. More important - for both herself and the President's legacy - it also signalled Chelsea's emergence as a junior First Lady in her own right.</p> <p>Although Hillary insists that campaigning was Chelsea's choice, her appearances 'had some strategic value', says the New York pollster Maurice Caroll.

      "bodyText": "A globetrotting young woman who wields increasing power over the President of the United States will cross on to British soil from Ireland on Wednesday, one of three generations of women accompanying Bill Clinton on the last trip of his presidency. At her side will be a sprightly octogenarian, her grandmother - also a cogent influence on the US President and his legacy in the twilight of his office. The third woman will be the link between them: the senator for New York, who took her seat on Capitol Hill last week. They are Dorothy Rodham, her daughter Hillary and 20-year-old Chelsea. As the curtain descends on his presidency, Clinton already has one foot in the shadows as Hillary makes history and Chelsea emerges as a quiet power in her own right, after years of protected and protective seclusion. Chelsea has bloomed from a gawkish, frizzy-headed 12-year-old into a poised and independent young woman who posits vegetarianism against her father's taste for Big Macs. She has undergone a sea change in her ambitions - from the long-proclaimed profession of medicine to the family business of politics. As many interview requests for Chelsea as for the President now arrive at the White House (the answer is always no). And, like her father, she wants to go to Oxford. The other relative stranger in the formidable female trio is the President's mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham. For of all the places that Bill Clinton could go when he faces his identity crisis next January as the youngest former President (there's been much talk of Hollywood and Manhattan), he has chosen to stay with his mother-in-law down in Little Rock, Arkansas, where it all began. At Dorothy's condo in Hillcrest Heights, tucked among the cliffs that plunge into the Arkansas River, there's always an easy chair for Bill. 'I really like her,' explains the President. 'We really get along.' In Chelsea, Britain will get a close-up of a young woman steeled for the rigours of public life since the age of six. When her father was running for the governorship of Arkansas, Hillary told her daughter that people might one day say nasty things about Pop which were not true. There have been two very different moments when Chelsea stole the limelight from her parents. The first came during the summer horribilis of 1998, at the height of the Lewinsky scandal. After the President's trial by television, the Clinton trio took its longest walk across the South lawn towards an awaiting helicopter; Chelsea was a firewall wedged between her parents, part peacemaker, part victim. Chelsea's second moment came this autumn, during what is universally regarded as the proto-perfect political campaign her mother waged for the New York Senate seat. 'A pleasure to meet you,' grinned Chelsea to the phalanx of cameras that turned away from their usual target, Hillary, to focus on the 20-year old - looking relaxed and the spitting image of her father. Although she had been at her father's side during the campaigns of 1992 and 1996, this was Chelsea's coming-out moment. More important - for both herself and the President's legacy - it also signalled Chelsea's emergence as a junior First Lady in her own right. Although Hillary insists that campaigning was Chelsea's choice, her appearances 'had some strategic value', says the New York pollster Maurice Caroll. 'It's a plus, because Chelsea humanises Mrs Clinton; she makes her a Mom' - an image crucial to winning the women's vote. 'We need your help, we need your support,' Chelsea urged diners in a Polish restaurant in Buffalo. 'I love your grandchildren,' she beamed at an elderly minister. 'They're terrific.' But it was not only Hillary's political future that Chelsea was brought in to enhance. She had also opted to skip the fall quarter of her university year 'to spend more time with her father as he closed his two terms in office', says Hillary's spokeswoman Lissa Muscatine. Chelsea, says Muscatine, has wanted to 'experience and enjoy the final months of her father's presidency'. Chelsea spent much of the year travelling with her father on foreign policy assignments, including the Group of Eight meeting in Japan and the Camp David peace talks. Sources in the White House say that Chelsea played a 'delicate behind-the-scenes role' at Camp David, 'calming her father' who had 'blown a fuse a few times, with almost everybody'. She also mingled with the leaders to ease tensions, notably during a sticky dinner with Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak. One adviser admits that Chelsea was strategically deployed to embody the generations that would benefit from a Mid-East peace. When Clinton announced the collapse of the talks, he glanced straight at his daughter when he said: 'The clock is working against us'. In March, Chelsea accompanied her father to Asia and, more recently, to Africa and Colombia. 'She's terrific, charming and poised,' says Letita Baldridge, former chief of staff to Jaqueline Kennedy and Grande Dame of women's political image-building. Hillary and Chelsea were hosted by Vicky Swanson at a cancer benefit rock concert in Syracuse; Swanson said: 'She talked strongly about her passion and commitment - because of her grandmother'. This is an intriguing inspiration, given the weight of parental influence, but grandmother and granddaughter are known to be exceptionally close. The opaque but spirited octogenarian has only given two interviews since her son-in-law won the presidency in 1992. She liked Bill Clinton, she said in Vanity Fair two years ago, and thought he was good for her daughter. At the age of eight, Dorothy Howell was abandoned by her divorced parents and sent to live with her grandparents. She has since inculcated in her daughter and granddaughter the horror of divorce. As his presidency nears an end, Bill Clinton is said by aides to have seen more of Dorothy, consulted her and heeded her advice. One says that 'her presence [is] one of the things that makes him kind of sprightly these days'. Dorothy has, says a senior White House aide, become the pivot of the family - as she herself said once: 'Imagine having a carpenter's level inside you. You try to keep that bubble in the centre. Sometimes it will go way up there and you have to bring it back.'",

Outside her window the air was thick with smog, the roads packed with people.</p> <p>But a Chinese festival was approaching, and a friend who had travelled with her to China brought the news she'd been waiting for: 'They are going to shoot - to execute - the criminals. Then we will have the organs and they can carry out the transplant for you all.'</p> <p>This was in April, and Yong had travelled to a hospital run by the People's Liberation Army in the Chinese provincial city of Chongqing. She paid the hospital $10,000 in cash for her new organ.</p> <p>The friend who had travelled with her was Wilson Yeo, who had paid for a kidney from the same hospital a few months earlier, and has since helped many others make the trip. He, too, was in no doubt about where his new organ came from, though he did ask for more details about the donor.</p> <p>'I said to the doctor, give me more information, I'm worried, you know. He said: \"Don't worry, yours is a 19-year-old kidney, probably a drug smuggler, put to death\".' He had organised his trip directly with the head of the transplant unit and says the doctors were very open about the source of the kidneys.</p> <p>One of Wilson's biggest worries was carrying so much cash. But he was met at the airport by the head of the unit, in army uniform, and taken by army van to Chongqing's Third Affiliated Hospital.</p> <p>'At that point my only consideration was that I had to survive. I have a family. I have kids,' he says, 'I didn't think about the ethical part.'</p> <p>He says 30 people in three wards were waiting for a transplant during his stay. Four foreigners on his ward, paying twice as much as the Chinese, were given priority. He says one older man from Malacca was told he was unfit for the operation. But he slipped some extra cash to the doctor. He got his transplant, but died several days later.</p> <p>Yong, a science teacher, had been desperate, warned she would not survive on dialysis: 'It's only when the doctor said it's a problem, it's endangering my life, that I decided to go to China.' She says she showered the doctors with gifts after her operation - a pewter teapot, a silver chain and necklace. 'They treated us well, so we rewarded them.'</p> <p>Support groups in Malacca reckon several dozen desperate people suffering from kidney failure have made the journey, since two top officials from the Chongqing army hospital visited in 1998.

There is a 16-year waiting list for a kidney: with more than 6,000 people on dialysis, there were only six donors in Malaysia last year.</p> <p>Although moves are afoot to strengthen the Malaysian donor programme, kidney failure for most means life on a dialysis machine - four hours a day, three days a week.</p> <p>The director of the National Kidney Foundation in the capital Kuala Lumpur, Dr Thiruventhiran, says people come to him daily asking about going to China.</p> <p>'Most of my patients are desperate,' he says. 'I spend hours talking to patients. I'm not too sure what I'm doing now - trying to convince them not to do it or to do it. But I do want to give them a true picture of what's going on.'</p> <p>He says hospital records show 60 to 70 people have returned after operations in China this year, though the true figure is probably much higher, since records show only those needing after-care.</p> <p>He reckons several hundred have made the journey from Malaysia to a string of provincial Chinese hospitals offering commercial transplants.</p> <p>He confirms most kidneys are from executed convicts and says those returning have no paperwork about the donor and often awful complications.</p> <p>It's to Chongqing, though, that most of those from Malacca have travelled for their transplants. Posing as a prospective client, a Mandarin-speaking colleague telephoned the army hospital and was put through to Professor Li Qian Sheng, deputy director of the transplant unit.</p> <p>He offered the 'special' rate of 80,000 to 90,000 renminbi ($9,700 to $11,000) for a kidney. He said his unit had carried out 100 transplants this year alone on patients, largely from the overseas Chinese communities in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.</p> <p>His tone changed when asked whether the organs were from convicts: 'It's not convenient. I don't want to talk about this on the phone, but I can tell you they are good stuff.' Just say yes or no, we asked. 'No, no, no,' he said uncomfortably.</p> <p>In Malacca, Yong had to spend a month in hospital with complications after her return. But she has no regrets, and is now running a stall in a busy tourist street, trying to raise money to pay back the loan her daughter took out for the operation. Wilson is now jogging most afternoons, and organising another small group for Chongqing early next year.

He has few qualms about accepting a kidney from an executed convict. 'That's the way they do things in China.'</p> <p>For the desperate - those who can afford it - it's a question of survival.

      "body": "<p>Four months ago, for no apparent reason, the recorded voice of Stephen Hawking echoed ethereally round the Los Angeles convention centre. A weird, dislocated moment. The voice was backing Al Gore for President. Democrat delegations, partying on the floor, did not stop to listen - but now, perhaps, they should.</p> <p>This election has turned into a new, impenetrable chapter for Hawking's impenetrable book. A chapter, perhaps, called Finality Lost. The latest twist from Florida's Supreme Court - whether or not the decision is stayed or overturned as it leaves the sunshine state for federal courtrooms to the north - means one bleak thing. Emotionally, there can be no finality along any legal route. There may be decisions from Atlanta or from the US Supreme Court which hand the White House to George W. Bush, but there will be no settled end to the argument.</p> <p>If one more Florida judge out of seven had tipped the other way on Friday night, that would have signalled a reasonable close. Gore's backers on Capitol Hill, sensing defeat there, had long since decided to abandon the Vice-President and his unavailing fight: we would surely have been watching Al and George W. embracing, good sports in defeat and victory, healing statesmen bringing the country together (for at least 15 minutes).</p> <p>Forget it. The true focus - the only hope of finality - is back to the boxes of votes stacked in Leon County court house and in canvassing board cupboards around Florida.</p> <p>There are 40,000 or 50,000 of them that matter. They are the sole, emotional means left of telling America who really won - and the crazy thing is that three weeks of suit and counter-suit have brought us back only to a solution of common-sense fairness. The lawyers and politicians have merely got in the way.</p> <p>Simple facts. Florida's electoral system is a broken-down joke, a mix of clanky machines and muddy law. It is not up to coping with an election of massive import and harrowing closeness.</p> <p>There are four different ways of voting around the 67 counties, some ancient (like ticks on a piece of paper), some relatively modern (such as scanning marked forms into a computer). Only 25 counties use the wretched punch cards, and they, overwhelmingly, are where the problem lies.</p> <p>Sometimes, as the world now knows, the punches do not wholly detach the chad and the votes do not register on the IBM tabulating machines. You can count and recount mechanically, but only holding the cards up to the light and the human eye can discern intention. Does intention matter? It does when majorities are wafer thin.</p> <p>The Bush camp, for all their arrogancies and yobbo tactics, have always had a decent case - more decent than Democrat partisans have allowed. Look, they say: if the punch mechanisms are defective, they are at least neutral; they under-count equally between candidates. They are also the chosen, agreed way of deciding. The canvassing boards in Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties are all dominated by Democrats. The superviser who designed the butterfly ballot is a Democrat. If you play by the rules, these are the rules. We won.</p> <p>Worse still, they add, Gore is a bad loser. He will do anything to grind out spurious victory. He will shout 'Let every vote be counted' while his acolytes try to rule out tens of thousands of absentee ballots on technicalities. Desperate hypocrisy.</p> <p>There is no settled pattern for counting the semi-detached chads and dimples. Different counties have already staged their hand recounts differently. Shambles. Just stop messing about and admit it: We won.</p> <p>Bush's problem, though, has always been political rather than textbook technical. The 25 punch-card counties include most of Florida's biggest, poorest and most Democratic areas. Recounting there by hand would - statistically - favour Gore.</p> <p>That is why the gap (in Supreme Court terms) is down to 154, the whole presidency hanging by a chad. That is why Gore has been so desperate to set the hand recounts going.</p> <p>And the trouble for the Republicans today is that, emotionally again, he must be right. Almost three weeks back he offered his own solution - a statewide hand recount with plenty of time to agree standards and analyse the ballots.</p> <p>The Bush boys did not bite because (of course) they thought they might lose and wanted to hang on to the victories they had. Now the Florida Supreme Court has wrecked that strategy by ordering a statewide count of undervotes, the variously punctured chads. They have, in effect, ordered what Gore offered in early November: that a count not a court decides.</p> <p>You can whisk through dozens of immediately permutating scenarios from this point. The challenges, the injunctions, the stops and starts, the threat that Florida's state legislature, with its big Republican majority, will produce its own slate for the electoral college, the doomsday forecasts of the street-fighters on Capitol Hill deciding in the mists of Janu ary. Nightmare stuff: but this is an American nightmare. Yet the answer that matters is still in those boxes. The chads are hanging in there.</p> <p>You can, from afar, make too much of the political bias of judges, canvassing boards, even State warrior women like Katherine Harris. It was (remember) the Democrat Dade board who thwarted Gore by stopping recounting and the Democrat Palm Beach board which did not count chads the way he wanted.</p> <p>The Florida Supreme Court divided Democrat against Democrat.

      "bodyText": "Four months ago, for no apparent reason, the recorded voice of Stephen Hawking echoed ethereally round the Los Angeles convention centre. A weird, dislocated moment. The voice was backing Al Gore for President. Democrat delegations, partying on the floor, did not stop to listen - but now, perhaps, they should. This election has turned into a new, impenetrable chapter for Hawking's impenetrable book. A chapter, perhaps, called Finality Lost. The latest twist from Florida's Supreme Court - whether or not the decision is stayed or overturned as it leaves the sunshine state for federal courtrooms to the north - means one bleak thing. Emotionally, there can be no finality along any legal route. There may be decisions from Atlanta or from the US Supreme Court which hand the White House to George W. Bush, but there will be no settled end to the argument. If one more Florida judge out of seven had tipped the other way on Friday night, that would have signalled a reasonable close. Gore's backers on Capitol Hill, sensing defeat there, had long since decided to abandon the Vice-President and his unavailing fight: we would surely have been watching Al and George W. embracing, good sports in defeat and victory, healing statesmen bringing the country together (for at least 15 minutes). Forget it. The true focus - the only hope of finality - is back to the boxes of votes stacked in Leon County court house and in canvassing board cupboards around Florida. There are 40,000 or 50,000 of them that matter. They are the sole, emotional means left of telling America who really won - and the crazy thing is that three weeks of suit and counter-suit have brought us back only to a solution of common-sense fairness. The lawyers and politicians have merely got in the way. Simple facts. Florida's electoral system is a broken-down joke, a mix of clanky machines and muddy law. It is not up to coping with an election of massive import and harrowing closeness. There are four different ways of voting around the 67 counties, some ancient (like ticks on a piece of paper), some relatively modern (such as scanning marked forms into a computer). Only 25 counties use the wretched punch cards, and they, overwhelmingly, are where the problem lies. Sometimes, as the world now knows, the punches do not wholly detach the chad and the votes do not register on the IBM tabulating machines. You can count and recount mechanically, but only holding the cards up to the light and the human eye can discern intention. Does intention matter? It does when majorities are wafer thin. The Bush camp, for all their arrogancies and yobbo tactics, have always had a decent case - more decent than Democrat partisans have allowed. Look, they say: if the punch mechanisms are defective, they are at least neutral; they under-count equally between candidates. They are also the chosen, agreed way of deciding. The canvassing boards in Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties are all dominated by Democrats. The superviser who designed the butterfly ballot is a Democrat. If you play by the rules, these are the rules. We won. Worse still, they add, Gore is a bad loser. He will do anything to grind out spurious victory. He will shout 'Let every vote be counted' while his acolytes try to rule out tens of thousands of absentee ballots on technicalities. Desperate hypocrisy. There is no settled pattern for counting the semi-detached chads and dimples. Different counties have already staged their hand recounts differently. Shambles. Just stop messing about and admit it: We won. Bush's problem, though, has always been political rather than textbook technical. The 25 punch-card counties include most of Florida's biggest, poorest and most Democratic areas. Recounting there by hand would - statistically - favour Gore. That is why the gap (in Supreme Court terms) is down to 154, the whole presidency hanging by a chad. That is why Gore has been so desperate to set the hand recounts going. And the trouble for the Republicans today is that, emotionally again, he must be right. Almost three weeks back he offered his own solution - a statewide hand recount with plenty of time to agree standards and analyse the ballots. The Bush boys did not bite because (of course) they thought they might lose and wanted to hang on to the victories they had. Now the Florida Supreme Court has wrecked that strategy by ordering a statewide count of undervotes, the variously punctured chads. They have, in effect, ordered what Gore offered in early November: that a count not a court decides. You can whisk through dozens of immediately permutating scenarios from this point. The challenges, the injunctions, the stops and starts, the threat that Florida's state legislature, with its big Republican majority, will produce its own slate for the electoral college, the doomsday forecasts of the street-fighters on Capitol Hill deciding in the mists of Janu ary. Nightmare stuff: but this is an American nightmare. Yet the answer that matters is still in those boxes. The chads are hanging in there. You can, from afar, make too much of the political bias of judges, canvassing boards, even State warrior women like Katherine Harris. It was (remember) the Democrat Dade board who thwarted Gore by stopping recounting and the Democrat Palm Beach board which did not count chads the way he wanted. The Florida Supreme Court divided Democrat against Democrat. The hand recounts so far have had observers from both parties in at the death and, for all the Republican noise, been conducted without fundamental challenge to their fairness. On the ground, in short, there is more integrity and independence than the screaming politicians would have you believe. Nor, with proper manpower, need a recount of the undervotes take long. This is not putting a man on the moon: it is scrutinising the votes from a couple of British constituencies on election night. Is that better than Jeb Bush's legislature battalions producing their own 'victory' in the electoral college - or Tom DeLay's attack dogs picking Bush on the Hill next year? Absolutely, if there is to be any tranquillity thereafter. It is even better than the US Supreme Court stepping in and calling an artificial halt before the ballots can be recounted - for the ballots themselves will remain, testimony to an enduring, contrary reality throughout the Bush years.

      "body": "<p>Every time a Russian rocket lifts off from its launch pad at Baikonur, residents in the tiny Siberian village of Ploskoye, more than 1,000 miles away, are shaken nine minutes later by a terrible explosion. </p> <p>If it is dark, firework flashes are visible in the sky above their homes, with streaking flames burning through the air as fuel falls to Earth. During the day a misty yellowish cloud sometimes hangs over the region. Villagers say the noise of the blast sets dogs howling for hours. </p> <p>In the days after each launch, rocket fragments from the shuttles ferrying astronauts and equipment to Mir, or to the International Space Station, can be found in the hills and forests nearby. </p> <p>From time to time, local farmers discover massive, shining metal cylinders - up to seven metres long and three metres wide - which have in the past been seized with delight and converted into chicken coops, hunting huts or grain storage tanks. </p> <p>Recently, however, as more information emerges about the poisonous fuels lining the wreckage, locals have started to regard the debris with mounting alarm. Village doctors have charted a growth in illnesses among their patients - from cancer to bronchial spasms to defects in new-born children - and concluded they are connected to the scattering of cosmic litter on the region. Teachers report that in the days following each launch, children complain of stomach pains, dizziness and headaches and find it hard to concentrate. </p> <p>After decades of concealing the problem, the Russian space agency, Rosaviakosmos, has conceded the regular jettisoning of sections of rocket engine on this region of Siberia and up to 20 other areas in Russia may have a harmful effect on the local population and has agreed to fund preliminary research. Villagers demand compensation for the harmful effects of living for the past 40 years in what they see as a huge dustbin for Russia's space programme. </p> <p>The problem lies in the design of the Soyuz and Proton rockets, built to discard the engines that power their lift-off and passage through the atmosphere. The Soyuz's first four side-blocks - each of which contains four engines - drop from its hull around a minute after lift-off over Kazakhstan. The second stage of the rocket, which contains another four engines, drops eight minutes later, while a third is meant to burn up in the sky. </p> <p>According to maps held at Rosaviakosmos's headquarters in Moscow, the second section should fall somewhere within an area in an uninhabited part of the mountains of Gorno-Altai, classified Dropping Region 306. In reality, say the villagers of Ploskoye and nearby Novoaleiskoye, several miles outside the allocated space, the rocket pieces rain down on them. </p> <p>The danger of anyone being hurt by a falling fragment is extremely slim, and Rosaviakosmos officials point out that since Russia's space programme began in 1960, the only casualties have been cattle. But the real danger lies in the unburnt rocket fuel that falls with the metal. </p> <p>While Soyuz rockets are powered by a relatively innocuous combination of kerosene and liquid oxygen, Proton rockets run on a highly noxious fuel called heptyl which can cause severe blood and liver problems. Viktor Pakhomov, 55, head of the Ploskoye administration, is seeking to discover why, in his village of 1,000, people are becoming more and more unwell. For 40 years, little official research has been done into the connections between illness and the space programme; so Pakhomov has tried to catalogue its effects himself. </p> <p>As a result of his attempts to collect and identify toxic fuel remnants, he has burnt his retinas to the point of near-blindness, suffered from temporary paralysis in his hands and scorched his lungs by breathing in poisonous fluids. 'We have never been sent any protective equipment to help us handle the material, because the local authorities have never admitted there is a problem,' he said. </p> <p>The space agency warns him of most launches, and he broadcasts a radio warning telling locals to stay inside and avoid drawing water from rivers in the days following. </p> <p>He has recorded all cases of sickness after launches. Villagers have become ill from eating cucumbers from their gardens after rocket debris was found nearby, men have come out in blisters from swimming in the river, and farmers' arms have been covered in sores harvesting hay. </p> <p>Ploskoye doctor Olga Varova is besieged by new patients every time a rocket is launched. 'We have people complaining of nausea, vomiting, headaches and finding it hard to breathe,' she said. 'But more worrying are what appear to be the cumulative effects of the pollution. In the last five years, not one child in the village has been born completely fit - each baby has been diagnosed with blood problems or nervous system complaints.' </p> <p>Emma Ladoga, acting head doctor at the regional hospital, said: 'People here aren't ill because they're poor; we think their illnesses are connected to the environmental situation.' A study showed people from the affected villages were twice as likely to suffer from thyroid cancers as those in a control village. </p> <p>Mikhail Shashin, head of the Siberian environmental group, Katun, said pollution from space activity was a serious international problem - only American citizens did not suffer in the same way, because rockets launched in the US drop their debris over the ocean. 'If the situation is to improve, we need to have a global agreement restricting the number of rocket launches,' he said. </p> <p>Under a new agreement signed between Rosaviakosmos and the local authorities, the region surrounding Ploskoye will get 90,000 roubles (\u00a32,250) every time a commercial launch takes place. The money does not represent compensation, but is allocated as rent on the land for the six hours during which lift-off occurs. </p> <p>'We don't believe there is any case for compensation yet. Rocket launches, like industrial activity, aeroplane or car travel, naturally have some effect on the environment, but there is nothing to prove people are suffering,' Alexander Bolysov of Rosaviakosmos commented. 'These environmental issues have become very fashionable recently. Nobody ever suggests that we should stop air travel because people occasionally die on aeroplanes.' </p> <p>But the allocation of new money to fund research into environmental and health problems in the region indicates the organisation has become uncomfortable about inhabitants' complaints. </p> <p>So far the only money villagers in Ploskoye have seen was a nine rouble (22.5p) handout from the local administration to each inhabitant earlier this year. </p> <p>Nikolai Shtifinov, head of the local environment committee, said: 'In any civilised country, the government would admit the problem and would pay us compensation. What do we get? Nine roubles - it's not even enough to buy a jar of coffee.'</p>",

In the days after each launch, rocket fragments from the shuttles ferrying astronauts and equipment to Mir, or to the International Space Station, can be found in the hills and forests nearby. From time to time, local farmers discover massive, shining metal cylinders - up to seven metres long and three metres wide - which have in the past been seized with delight and converted into chicken coops, hunting huts or grain storage tanks. Recently, however, as more information emerges about the poisonous fuels lining the wreckage, locals have started to regard the debris with mounting alarm. Village doctors have charted a growth in illnesses among their patients - from cancer to bronchial spasms to defects in new-born children - and concluded they are connected to the scattering of cosmic litter on the region. Teachers report that in the days following each launch, children complain of stomach pains, dizziness and headaches and find it hard to concentrate. After decades of concealing the problem, the Russian space agency, Rosaviakosmos, has conceded the regular jettisoning of sections of rocket engine on this region of Siberia and up to 20 other areas in Russia may have a harmful effect on the local population and has agreed to fund preliminary research. Villagers demand compensation for the harmful effects of living for the past 40 years in what they see as a huge dustbin for Russia's space programme. The problem lies in the design of the Soyuz and Proton rockets, built to discard the engines that power their lift-off and passage through the atmosphere. The Soyuz's first four side-blocks - each of which contains four engines - drop from its hull around a minute after lift-off over Kazakhstan. The second stage of the rocket, which contains another four engines, drops eight minutes later, while a third is meant to burn up in the sky. According to maps held at Rosaviakosmos's headquarters in Moscow, the second section should fall somewhere within an area in an uninhabited part of the mountains of Gorno-Altai, classified Dropping Region 306. In reality, say the villagers of Ploskoye and nearby Novoaleiskoye, several miles outside the allocated space, the rocket pieces rain down on them. The danger of anyone being hurt by a falling fragment is extremely slim, and Rosaviakosmos officials point out that since Russia's space programme began in 1960, the only casualties have been cattle. But the real danger lies in the unburnt rocket fuel that falls with the metal. While Soyuz rockets are powered by a relatively innocuous combination of kerosene and liquid oxygen, Proton rockets run on a highly noxious fuel called heptyl which can cause severe blood and liver problems. Viktor Pakhomov, 55, head of the Ploskoye administration, is seeking to discover why, in his village of 1,000, people are becoming more and more unwell. For 40 years, little official research has been done into the connections between illness and the space programme; so Pakhomov has tried to catalogue its effects himself. As a result of his attempts to collect and identify toxic fuel remnants, he has burnt his retinas to the point of near-blindness, suffered from temporary paralysis in his hands and scorched his lungs by breathing in poisonous fluids. 'We have never been sent any protective equipment to help us handle the material, because the local authorities have never admitted there is a problem,' he said. The space agency warns him of most launches, and he broadcasts a radio warning telling locals to stay inside and avoid drawing water from rivers in the days following. He has recorded all cases of sickness after launches. Villagers have become ill from eating cucumbers from their gardens after rocket debris was found nearby, men have come out in blisters from swimming in the river, and farmers' arms have been covered in sores harvesting hay. Ploskoye doctor Olga Varova is besieged by new patients every time a rocket is launched. 'We have people complaining of nausea, vomiting, headaches and finding it hard to breathe,' she said. 'But more worrying are what appear to be the cumulative effects of the pollution. In the last five years, not one child in the village has been born completely fit - each baby has been diagnosed with blood problems or nervous system complaints.' Emma Ladoga, acting head doctor at the regional hospital, said: 'People here aren't ill because they're poor; we think their illnesses are connected to the environmental situation.' A study showed people from the affected villages were twice as likely to suffer from thyroid cancers as those in a control village. Mikhail Shashin, head of the Siberian environmental group, Katun, said pollution from space activity was a serious international problem - only American citizens did not suffer in the same way, because rockets launched in the US drop their debris over the ocean. 'If the situation is to improve, we need to have a global agreement restricting the number of rocket launches,' he said. Under a new agreement signed between Rosaviakosmos and the local authorities, the region surrounding Ploskoye will get 90,000 roubles (\u00a32,250) every time a commercial launch takes place. The money does not represent compensation, but is allocated as rent on the land for the six hours during which lift-off occurs. 'We don't believe there is any case for compensation yet. Rocket launches, like industrial activity, aeroplane or car travel, naturally have some effect on the environment, but there is nothing to prove people are suffering,' Alexander Bolysov of Rosaviakosmos commented. 'These environmental issues have become very fashionable recently. Nobody ever suggests that we should stop air travel because people occasionally die on aeroplanes.' But the allocation of new money to fund research into environmental and health problems in the region indicates the organisation has become uncomfortable about inhabitants' complaints. So far the only money villagers in Ploskoye have seen was a nine rouble (22.5p) handout from the local administration to each inhabitant earlier this year. Nikolai Shtifinov, head of the local environment committee, said: 'In any civilised country, the government would admit the problem and would pay us compensation. What do we get? Nine roubles - it's not even enough to buy a jar of coffee.'",

      "body": "<p>We can fix the moment and cherish it like the memory of first love through the long, Mogadon days of the election 'debate'. On the afternoon of Wednesday 6 December, Tony Blair levelled with the public and described the joint programme of New Labour and the Old Conservatives with unprecedented candour and a scrupulous respect for all the relevant facts. He stared across the Commons at the admittedly disorientating figures of William Hague and Ann Widdecombe and countered their ridicule of his Queen's Speech with:</p> <p>'What is the alternative? What does the Right Hon Gentleman offer? Why was it that he made a policy-free speech, apart from a load of nonsense from the shadow Home Secretary, most of which we are doing in any event?'</p> <p>I couldn't have put it better myself. As an epitaph for a political class that strikes the poses of tough-on-crime populism to keep the proles' eyes from fixing on anything but the ball, the Prime Minister's flash of honesty is impossible to beat.</p> <p>Before us we have the first Labour administration in a generation. For two years it stuck to Conservative tax and spending limits while the gap between rich and poor spanned an ever-wider chasm and squalid public services degenerated yet further. For about six months it busied itself with this and that. My progressive colleagues were impressed, although I'm afraid all that lodged in my brain was the Government's determination to privatise hospitals and air traffic control - services which Thatcher at her most unbalanced had left unmolested.</p> <p>Now Blair is rushing into a needlessly early election with the slogan that there is no reason to vote for nonsensical Tory stunts because New Labour's will be just as asinine. A glance at Blair's programme confirms that this is one promise which will be kept. The Queen's Speech showed him to be a trivial man who believes his most urgent tasks are to go for fox hunters, juries, drunks and children up after bedtime.</p> <p>There is a great temptation when confronted with such banalities to dismiss the Hagues and Blairs as gesture politicians who can't do real damage. And in many instances contemptuous indifference is all you need.</p> <p>Last week's headline-grabbing announcement was that the age at which curfews could be imposed on children who have committed no crime would rise from 10 to 16. Alert journalists noted that Blair's love of the tactics of martial law wouldn't change the world. English councils already have the power to place the under-10s under house arrest. No local authority has used them. Not one.</p> <p>Who can blame them? The inspiration for kiddie curfews came from a conversation I had with a rambling Jack Straw in 1996. He was impressed by the poll ratings Bill Clinton had achieved after he advocated treating teenagers as the enemies within (or, rather, without). Straw phoned me back to say he didn't mean it and asked me to forget what he had said.</p> <p>Because I refused and The Observer ran the story, New Labour had to invent a policy in 30 seconds and pretend it was the result of a solemn and rigorous analysis.</p> <p>But the banal can also be dangerously brutal. All the punditry of the past week has missed the Government's decision to introduce a bill which tears up the presumption that we are innocent until proved guilty.</p> <p>If you have money and the police take against you, they will be able to demand that you either prove your wealth was earned legally or lose it. An accusation will be enough to force you to reveal your finances. Your assets will be frozen while you wait for the case to come to court. When it does, the police will not have to 'prove beyond reasonable doubt' that your lucre is the proceeds of crime - just that the money was 'probably' made illegally.</p> <p>The measure, of course, is aimed against the gangsters whose astonishing fortunes have been built on drug prohibitions that Blair and Hague support. Like many others, I find the criminal profits that the unwinnable war creates terrifying, not least because of the corruption the money promotes - you can't move in the Old Bailey these days without running into alleged bent copper prosecutions.</p> <p>What the Government is saying is that if the police 'know' that Bloggs is a drugs baron we should trust them and that should be enough. No need for boring old legal procedures. Often detectives do know and if the bill becomes law our mafiosi could become like Al Capone, another beneficiary of prohibition, and be caught by accountants rather than detectives.</p> <p>But in the US, to which New Labour has again turned for ideas to fill its tiny mind, some gangsters are caught but many more flourish unmolested. It is the innocent who carry cash who suffer the most. Gamblers going to Las Vegas, black men in flash cars and those who pay in notes rather than with credit cards are stopped and fleeced and have to fight for years to get their property back. The lesson is that when you remove the rule of law, the law of unintended consequences kicks in with a vengeance.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the lesson from America our politicians want to learn is the exact opposite. Peter Mandelson and Tony Blair are disturbed that a booming economy, for the wealthy at any rate, has not yet produced an Al Gore victory. A strong economy was not enough for the US Democrats, Mandelson has been telling his friends. New Labour must fight on 'quality of life issues' - of which crime is the most prominent. Hence a Queen's Speech stuffed with assaults on liberty Xeroxed from Bill Clinton's worthless administration.</p> <p>I often wonder if Mandelson is animated by any intelligence beyond low cunning. If Gore loses, he should blame his and Clinton's ferocious crime policies. Two million Americans are denied the vote because they have been dumped in a vast prison system, whose size only the countries of the old Soviet Union can match. Those who have served their time are disenfranchised on release as an additional punishment. If they could have voted, most who bothered would have voted Democrat and Gore would have the White House.</p> <p>The American Third Way is, gratifyingly, being destroyed by its own cynical barbarism - or 'pragmatism' as it's now called. How does the clich\u00e9 run? Something about what is happening in America today happens in Britain five years later.</p> <p>We know that Peniel Pentecostal Church has taken over much of the Brentwood and Ongar Conservative Association. The papers have been full of how dissident Essex Tories begged Martin Bell to stand against their MP, Eric Pickles, who found it politic to welcome the evangelists to the Conservative congregation. Less has been said about what it was in the theology of the Peniel Pentecostalists which has driven loyalists in one of the last ditches of Tory England to revolt.</p> <p>The sect is led by 'Bishop' Michael Reid, a Mercedes-driving former policeman, who promises his credulous flock that his miracles can cure cancer. (He has made millions by selling insurance policies to the faithful as backups in case his prayers for divine intervention are unanswered.)</p> <p>The Bishop is a traditionalist on sexual questions, and if he ever gets thrown out of the God business he could make a comfortable living on the Daily Mail . At the Peniel Women's Conference, Reid read from the Good Wives Guide , published in America a mere 50 years ago, and commended its rules. Here, for the benefit of women readers wondering how to keep a man, is the advice of the pastor tending the soul of the modern Conservative Party.</p> <p>'Have dinner ready. Plan ahead, even the night before, to have a delicious meal ready on time for his return. This is a way of letting him know that you have been thinking about him and are concerned about his needs.'</p> <p>On no account must you look tired after the cooking, rather, 'take 15 minutes to rest so you'll be refreshed when he arrives. Touch up your makeup, put a ribbon in your hair and be fresh-looking. He has just been with a lot of work-weary people. Be a little gay and a little more interesting for him. [No, I do not think the Bishop wants wives to pander to male lesbian fantasies.] His boring day may need a lift and one of your duties is to provide it.'</p> <p>The children must look as good as you do. 'Take a few minutes to wash their hands and faces (if they are small). Minimise all noise. At the time of his arrival, eliminate all noise of the washer, dryer or vacuum.'</p> <p>When the grooming is done, the wife must be prepared to defer to the man at all times. If she speaks at all it should be in a 'low, soothing and pleasant voice'. She may think that her husband has fallen under the influence of crackpot preachers and politicians, but she should learn to hold her tongue. 'Listen to him. Let him talk first - remember, his topics of conversation are more important than yours.' Even in suspicious circumstances she must be silent. 'Never complain if he's late home for dinner or even if he stays out all night. Remember, he is the master of the house and as such will always exercise his will with fairness and truthfulness. You have no right to question him.'</p> <p>The humiliated and servile Tory wife has always been a figure of fun. How good it is to see that the party of young Willie Hague is keeping the tradition alive.</p>",

An accusation will be enough to force you to reveal your finances. Your assets will be frozen while you wait for the case to come to court. When it does, the police will not have to 'prove beyond reasonable doubt' that your lucre is the proceeds of crime - just that the money was 'probably' made illegally. The measure, of course, is aimed against the gangsters whose astonishing fortunes have been built on drug prohibitions that Blair and Hague support. Like many others, I find the criminal profits that the unwinnable war creates terrifying, not least because of the corruption the money promotes - you can't move in the Old Bailey these days without running into alleged bent copper prosecutions. What the Government is saying is that if the police 'know' that Bloggs is a drugs baron we should trust them and that should be enough. No need for boring old legal procedures. Often detectives do know and if the bill becomes law our mafiosi could become like Al Capone, another beneficiary of prohibition, and be caught by accountants rather than detectives. But in the US, to which New Labour has again turned for ideas to fill its tiny mind, some gangsters are caught but many more flourish unmolested. It is the innocent who carry cash who suffer the most. Gamblers going to Las Vegas, black men in flash cars and those who pay in notes rather than with credit cards are stopped and fleeced and have to fight for years to get their property back. The lesson is that when you remove the rule of law, the law of unintended consequences kicks in with a vengeance. Unfortunately, the lesson from America our politicians want to learn is the exact opposite. Peter Mandelson and Tony Blair are disturbed that a booming economy, for the wealthy at any rate, has not yet produced an Al Gore victory. A strong economy was not enough for the US Democrats, Mandelson has been telling his friends. New Labour must fight on 'quality of life issues' - of which crime is the most prominent. Hence a Queen's Speech stuffed with assaults on liberty Xeroxed from Bill Clinton's worthless administration. I often wonder if Mandelson is animated by any intelligence beyond low cunning. If Gore loses, he should blame his and Clinton's ferocious crime policies. Two million Americans are denied the vote because they have been dumped in a vast prison system, whose size only the countries of the old Soviet Union can match. Those who have served their time are disenfranchised on release as an additional punishment. If they could have voted, most who bothered would have voted Democrat and Gore would have the White House. The American Third Way is, gratifyingly, being destroyed by its own cynical barbarism - or 'pragmatism' as it's now called. How does the clich\u00e9 run? Something about what is happening in America today happens in Britain five years later. We know that Peniel Pentecostal Church has taken over much of the Brentwood and Ongar Conservative Association. The papers have been full of how dissident Essex Tories begged Martin Bell to stand against their MP, Eric Pickles, who found it politic to welcome the evangelists to the Conservative congregation. Less has been said about what it was in the theology of the Peniel Pentecostalists which has driven loyalists in one of the last ditches of Tory England to revolt. The sect is led by 'Bishop' Michael Reid, a Mercedes-driving former policeman, who promises his credulous flock that his miracles can cure cancer. (He has made millions by selling insurance policies to the faithful as backups in case his prayers for divine intervention are unanswered.) The Bishop is a traditionalist on sexual questions, and if he ever gets thrown out of the God business he could make a comfortable living on the Daily Mail . At the Peniel Women's Conference, Reid read from the Good Wives Guide , published in America a mere 50 years ago, and commended its rules. Here, for the benefit of women readers wondering how to keep a man, is the advice of the pastor tending the soul of the modern Conservative Party. 'Have dinner ready. Plan ahead, even the night before, to have a delicious meal ready on time for his return. This is a way of letting him know that you have been thinking about him and are concerned about his needs.' On no account must you look tired after the cooking, rather, 'take 15 minutes to rest so you'll be refreshed when he arrives. Touch up your makeup, put a ribbon in your hair and be fresh-looking. He has just been with a lot of work-weary people. Be a little gay and a little more interesting for him. [No, I do not think the Bishop wants wives to pander to male lesbian fantasies.] His boring day may need a lift and one of your duties is to provide it.' The children must look as good as you do. 'Take a few minutes to wash their hands and faces (if they are small). Minimise all noise. At the time of his arrival, eliminate all noise of the washer, dryer or vacuum.' When the grooming is done, the wife must be prepared to defer to the man at all times. If she speaks at all it should be in a 'low, soothing and pleasant voice'. She may think that her husband has fallen under the influence of crackpot preachers and politicians, but she should learn to hold her tongue. 'Listen to him. Let him talk first - remember, his topics of conversation are more important than yours.' Even in suspicious circumstances she must be silent. 'Never complain if he's late home for dinner or even if he stays out all night. Remember, he is the master of the house and as such will always exercise his will with fairness and truthfulness. You have no right to question him.' The humiliated and servile Tory wife has always been a figure of fun. How good it is to see that the party of young Willie Hague is keeping the tradition alive.",

      "byline": "Tamsin Blanchard",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The question everyone wants to ask John Pawson, who appears to live his life with only the clothes on his back and the bare walls of his home, is 'Where's all your stuff?' You know - the books, the newspapers, the bits of post, the elastic bands, the odd socks, the CDs, the spare change, the coffee cup left over from breakfast - the detritus that clutters up most of our lives. Well, I have the answer. I've seen it with my own eyes. The general mess and chaos is all there. It's just hidden behind closed doors. What Pawson has managed to do in his own west London home is not pare down his life to a Zen-like minimum of possessions and 'stuff', but to build a house with adequate storage. Open any of the cupboard doors in the family's kitchen, and you will be relieved to discover that John Pawson is a human being, just like the rest of us. He's just a bit more organised. </p> <p>We've seen the Pawson home, where the minimalist architect lives with his wife Catherine and their two children, Caius and Benedict, on TV. We've seen it in the pages of magazines, and we've read about it in books. To actually set foot inside feels a little like stepping on to a film set. It's a Victorian semi that has been gutted and pared back to a modern, open space filled with light and calm, and very little else. Early next year, Pawson's latest project - a new showroom for Bulthaup, the German kitchen company - will open to the public. 'My thing was not to upstage the kitchen or the art - it's a fairly neutral background. I wanted to provide a calm place where you and your partner can go and sit and have a bit of fun planning your kitchen.' </p> <p>'Bulthaup is a very functional and well designed product,' says Pawson. And kitchens are an area he is interested in. He's currently working on a cookbook with food writer Annie Bell. 'It's called Living and Eating . I wanted a list, so throughout the year there are very simple, straightforward meals for friends and family - not highfalutin dinner party stuff, just proper food. He and Bell have been discussing menus for some time, and the photos for the book are being shot in his own kitchen. She does the eating part and he provides the lifestyle angle. 'I also wanted to say to people, \"I suggest before the meal you have this ap\u00e9ritif and you drink it out of this glass, and for this particular meal you use this knife, fork and plate.\" It's just like saying here is a blueprint and then you can say bollocks if you want to. You can either adopt it or completely disagree with it. </p> <p>'For me, heaven is a beautiful piece of white fish and some interesting green vegetables or a bit of salad on the side. It's a plate with a bit of space and something I can visually handle, rather than this pile of food that I used to have as a child because my father liked a joint of meat every night. I'm not saying I don't like that occasionally. It's not precious nouvelle cuisine all the time.' But Pawson does prefer fish to meat, unlike his children, who have developed a taste for steak - the bloodier the better. 'Caius likes his blue.' </p> <p>It seems as though we are soon going be as familiar with Pawson's kitchen as we are with Nigella Lawson's. 'It's the focal point of the house,' he says. It's the place where the family eats together, where the boys might do their homework, where guests might socialise. It's where the family plays canasta. The first thing that sets the basement kitchen apart from most others is that it is divided into two sections - one indoors and one out. The two spaces are divided by a wall of glass, but the kitchen units - a long run of white, floor-based units - are built along the full length, 7 metres of them outside and 10 metres inside. The limestone floor is the same inside and out, but obviously discolours and weathers outside. And even the tables are the same. Like the floor, the one outside has turned dark from being exposed to the elements. Outside, there is a built-in barbecue. The boiler is kept in one of the outside units, too. It all makes for a strange symmetry. </p> <p>Although it might look as cold on the inside as it is outside, the kitchen is a very comfortable place to be. 'You can't do good architecture unless you understand about living in it,' he says. The under-floor heating makes it warm, and the smell of coffee is inviting. I can hear a coffee machine spluttering away, but of course it is nowhere to be seen. Then Pawson opens one of the tall floor-to-ceiling cupboards on the opposite side to the floor units and, as if by magic, pulls out a simple white Wedgwood handle-less china cup half-filled with dark, thick espresso. It's like watching a TV chef - 'And here's one I prepared earlier.' </p> <p>Just as many people have their fridge or dishwasher built into their kitchen units, John Pawson has everything, including the coffee machine and kettle, built in. 'I don't like gadgets,' he says. 'We all have too much stuff because of weddings and presents. You just accumulate things - the juice extractor, the ice-cream maker. You have to make a decision to limit them.' </p> <p>The family has a toaster, but Dad prefers to make his toast under the grill. He is not a big cook. Catherine does the supermarket shopping (he says he is banned from going because he just buys armfuls of raspberries or cases of water, and she complains that he never checks the prices) and she does most of the cooking, too. 'Ben says I am quite good at toast,' he says. </p> <p>The kitchen system itself was designed by Pawson in 1996 for the exclusive Belgian specialists, Obumex. Most of the units, made from very hard polyester with stainless steel trim, have drawers in them. Pawson opens a cupboard door (there are no knobs, or bars - just a handle built into the top of each door) and behind it is a series of drawers. Deep ones contain pots and pans, or glass storage jars filled with cooking ingredients. Others hold stacks of white china plates and bowls, or cups and mugs, which, like most people's, are reassuringly mismatched.

      "bodyText": "The question everyone wants to ask John Pawson, who appears to live his life with only the clothes on his back and the bare walls of his home, is 'Where's all your stuff?' You know - the books, the newspapers, the bits of post, the elastic bands, the odd socks, the CDs, the spare change, the coffee cup left over from breakfast - the detritus that clutters up most of our lives. Well, I have the answer. I've seen it with my own eyes. The general mess and chaos is all there. It's just hidden behind closed doors. What Pawson has managed to do in his own west London home is not pare down his life to a Zen-like minimum of possessions and 'stuff', but to build a house with adequate storage. Open any of the cupboard doors in the family's kitchen, and you will be relieved to discover that John Pawson is a human being, just like the rest of us. He's just a bit more organised. We've seen the Pawson home, where the minimalist architect lives with his wife Catherine and their two children, Caius and Benedict, on TV. We've seen it in the pages of magazines, and we've read about it in books. To actually set foot inside feels a little like stepping on to a film set. It's a Victorian semi that has been gutted and pared back to a modern, open space filled with light and calm, and very little else. Early next year, Pawson's latest project - a new showroom for Bulthaup, the German kitchen company - will open to the public. 'My thing was not to upstage the kitchen or the art - it's a fairly neutral background. I wanted to provide a calm place where you and your partner can go and sit and have a bit of fun planning your kitchen.' 'Bulthaup is a very functional and well designed product,' says Pawson. And kitchens are an area he is interested in. He's currently working on a cookbook with food writer Annie Bell. 'It's called Living and Eating . I wanted a list, so throughout the year there are very simple, straightforward meals for friends and family - not highfalutin dinner party stuff, just proper food. He and Bell have been discussing menus for some time, and the photos for the book are being shot in his own kitchen. She does the eating part and he provides the lifestyle angle. 'I also wanted to say to people, \"I suggest before the meal you have this ap\u00e9ritif and you drink it out of this glass, and for this particular meal you use this knife, fork and plate.\" It's just like saying here is a blueprint and then you can say bollocks if you want to. You can either adopt it or completely disagree with it. 'For me, heaven is a beautiful piece of white fish and some interesting green vegetables or a bit of salad on the side. It's a plate with a bit of space and something I can visually handle, rather than this pile of food that I used to have as a child because my father liked a joint of meat every night. I'm not saying I don't like that occasionally. It's not precious nouvelle cuisine all the time.' But Pawson does prefer fish to meat, unlike his children, who have developed a taste for steak - the bloodier the better. 'Caius likes his blue.' It seems as though we are soon going be as familiar with Pawson's kitchen as we are with Nigella Lawson's. 'It's the focal point of the house,' he says. It's the place where the family eats together, where the boys might do their homework, where guests might socialise. It's where the family plays canasta. The first thing that sets the basement kitchen apart from most others is that it is divided into two sections - one indoors and one out. The two spaces are divided by a wall of glass, but the kitchen units - a long run of white, floor-based units - are built along the full length, 7 metres of them outside and 10 metres inside. The limestone floor is the same inside and out, but obviously discolours and weathers outside. And even the tables are the same. Like the floor, the one outside has turned dark from being exposed to the elements. Outside, there is a built-in barbecue. The boiler is kept in one of the outside units, too. It all makes for a strange symmetry. Although it might look as cold on the inside as it is outside, the kitchen is a very comfortable place to be. 'You can't do good architecture unless you understand about living in it,' he says. The under-floor heating makes it warm, and the smell of coffee is inviting. I can hear a coffee machine spluttering away, but of course it is nowhere to be seen. Then Pawson opens one of the tall floor-to-ceiling cupboards on the opposite side to the floor units and, as if by magic, pulls out a simple white Wedgwood handle-less china cup half-filled with dark, thick espresso. It's like watching a TV chef - 'And here's one I prepared earlier.' Just as many people have their fridge or dishwasher built into their kitchen units, John Pawson has everything, including the coffee machine and kettle, built in. 'I don't like gadgets,' he says. 'We all have too much stuff because of weddings and presents. You just accumulate things - the juice extractor, the ice-cream maker. You have to make a decision to limit them.' The family has a toaster, but Dad prefers to make his toast under the grill. He is not a big cook. Catherine does the supermarket shopping (he says he is banned from going because he just buys armfuls of raspberries or cases of water, and she complains that he never checks the prices) and she does most of the cooking, too. 'Ben says I am quite good at toast,' he says. The kitchen system itself was designed by Pawson in 1996 for the exclusive Belgian specialists, Obumex. Most of the units, made from very hard polyester with stainless steel trim, have drawers in them. Pawson opens a cupboard door (there are no knobs, or bars - just a handle built into the top of each door) and behind it is a series of drawers. Deep ones contain pots and pans, or glass storage jars filled with cooking ingredients. Others hold stacks of white china plates and bowls, or cups and mugs, which, like most people's, are reassuringly mismatched. Shallower ones are for cutlery. 'I haven't got round to doing the insides yet and organising. I've got this white rubber on the bottom because I don't really like divisions. I just like things lying there.' As it is, it's organised. Everything has its place. But it is by no means anally retentive. If Pawson had his way, however, he would have a whole bank of dishwashers so that they would act as storage as well as machines. 'It's crazy that you take a dish from the dishwasher to the cupboard and then to the table.' he says. He thinks you should simply unload dishes as you need them and put the dirties into the other machine ready to be washed. With a kitchen as minimal as this, detail is everything.

The taps are underneath the work surface - two linear chunks of steel that are satisfying to hold and turn. The same knobs are used for the customised gas cooker hob.

Urged on by similar forces - a press that proclaims Anglo-Saxon supremacy and rejects engagement with Europe as threat to national identity - today's Tories are going down the same road. A century ago, Conservative politicians picked quarrels with all of Britain's potential partners, even threatening to go to war with the United States over an obscure border dispute in South America. Economic isolation followed political posturing when, in 1902, Conservative leader Joe Chamberlain launched his campaign for economic protectionism through a system of trade preferences within the British Empire.

In the 1983 election, Labour wanted to pull out of Europe, a position that was maintained into the Nineties by senior Labour politicians and trade union leaders. John Smith defied this disfiguring Euroscepticism and fought to pull the party away from isolationism. Along with Neil Kinnock and Tony Blair, he helped transform the party's attitude. In 1997, Conservative newspaper adverts depicted Blair as a tiny puppet sitting on the knee of Chancellor Kohl. It did not prevent a Labour landslide. Instead of learning the obvious lesson, William Hague has become a latter-day champion of isolationism. It matters little what the European issue is. On the Euro, the Rapid Reaction Force and now the Treaty of Nice, the Conservative line is to say No. History is said to repeat itself, first as tragedy then as farce. In the case of the politics of isolationism, history in our country simply repeats itself, period. The Conservatives have become a single-issue party obsessed with saying No to Europe. As a Labour MP, I may welcome the electoral gains that come to Labour as the British people will always reject such politics. But our nation's interests are not served by the obsessive press and political campaign against Europe. I long to see a young Tory John Smith who will stand up in the Conservative Party for common sense on Europe. Isolationist anti-Europeanism is dead-end politics. Labour learnt that lesson the hard way. Can William Hague or Michael Portillo? Denis MacShane is MP for Rotherham.",

The answer, it turns out, lies not so much with good acumen than with good fortune. Like so many medical discoveries before it, this breakthrough was made by pure serendipity.</p> <p>It all happened when a German man, known in the world of Aids research as 'the Berlin patient', went against doctor's orders and temporarily stopped his triple combination drug treatment. In fact, he stopped and started his treatment several times before eventually ceasing the drugs for good. To the astonishment of his physicians, the virus has remained undetectable in his bloodstream ever since.</p> <p>His haphazard approach to treatment thus sparked the current spate of trials.</p> <p>Of course, such serendipitous leaps forward have happened before. One of the most shocking examples occurred in 1847 when a man named Phineas Gage accidentally lobotomised himself.</p> <p>He was working on the American railroad blasting rocks when an explosion sent an iron bar through the front of his skull.

She is a great advocate of 'blue-sky' research - the term given to curiosity driven investigations which often have their origins in the accidental, unexplained or unexpected. She claims that some of medicine's most ground-breaking advances have occurred in this way.</p> <p>Take the case of the South African doctors who stumbled across a potential treatment for the deadly Ebola virus which recently killed over 100 people in Uganda. The disease is fatal in almost 90 per cent of cases, and yet in 1997 a patient managed to beat the condition after receiving the 'wrong' medication.</p> <p>The man had arrived in South Africa seeking treatment for his 'chronic gastritis' and doctors, unaware that he was actually suffering from Ebola, put him on steroids.</p> <p>Amazingly, he responded so positively that he was well enough to return home. Details of the patient's case were passed to American researchers and tests are now taking place to see if steroid treatment can be used to combat Ebola.</p> <p>Viagra, dubbed the miracle cure for impotence, is another accidental triumph.

Simply remind yourself over and over, 'It's perfectly natural and OK for me to feel shy and awkward.' Because it is. In fact, shyness and awkwardness, when one is open and accepting about it, can be quite fetching. Thom York, for example, has made a career from it. So be shy, but be proud to be shy.

      "body": "<b>Lorraine Tapper, social worker, 45</b> <p>There wasn't anything specific that made me go into therapy, my whole life just didn't seem to be working out. It was a combination of factors: career, money, bad relationships. Being unhappy was a dominant theme for me. I really wasn't enjoying my life and it probably was pretty miserable for people to be around me. I was shy, afraid, angry and resentful - all these things that I just didn't want to be. Then I saw an ad for a one-day self-development course run by Christene Burgess who works from London's Ability Centre.</p> <p>The self-esteem course helped me see I could do things differently, so I decided to have one-to-one therapy. It took a while to work because I was still very resistant. I'd had a lot of years of being scared and sad, and there wasn't going to be an immediate solution. I'd been in therapy for about a year and a half when a friend recommended the Life Training programme in Belsize Park. I did one of the weekend workshops and it was a real eye-opener. We did a lot of partnership work in a variety of situations - on the course they teach you that people are your mirrors - they give you feedback and that, in turn, gives you opportunity for growth.</p> <p>One of the biggest things I learnt was how to deal with resentment. My father had been dead for 22 years and I was still angry with him for being strict with me as a child. One of the processes they teach you is how by holding that resentment, it affects your life and not the life of the person you're holding that resentment for. Knowing my part in my unhappiness meant that I could choose to be different.</p> <p>I used to be angry all the time, rigid - I was always right, everyone was always wrong. Before, I wouldn't let people see me upset, sad or vulnerable, now I realise the strength in having all my emotions. A few months ago a male client came into the office ranting and raving. At one time I'd have been defensive and stressed by the situation. Now I was able to see in front of me a man who was very hurt, very scared and frightened. I let him say what he had to say, and he really calmed down.</p> <p>I'm now developing my own business as a personal life coach. Before I'd only be happy if I'd got the right job, the right boyfriend. Now I'm just happy because I'm alive. I've found my sense of self and become a rounded person who makes a contribution to the world, whether it's through work, relationships or my teaching. And I've discovered that real happiness isn't attached to external things, it's an internal way of being. </p> <p><b>Max Mezzowave, composer, 34</b></p> <p> At 24, I was a complete stress victim. I worked as a courier, driving around London in the rush hour. I was very aggressive. I also used to go out drinking and partying every night. I was incredibly self-destructive and I'd rely on drink as an escape. I was in huge debt. I was almost in the gutter, living in bedsits and bumming around on people's floors. As a result, I wasn't very healthy either. In truth, I wasn't a desirable person. I was very depressed with myself, I felt I had an ability to do more with my life.</p> <p>Luckily, someone came along at the right time to point me in the right direction. Ironically, it was a person I'd met in a bar. She told me about sahaja yoga and meditation. Sahaja yoga focuses on the Indian philosophy of the seven chakras in your body; you meditate while someone heals you. I started to see the benefits straightaway. It was the first time I'd felt relaxed in a while.</p> <p>After five years, I moved on to the Chinese practice of Qi Gong. This is similar in that through movement and exercise, an instructor will give you the 'software' to channel your energy. When you reflect and expand on that, it's possible to become completely harmonised with your surroundings.</p> <p>Both yoga and Qi Gong have benefited me in lots of ways; I'm much calmer and more at peace with myself. I've started to understand what I'm about as a person, that whatever your actions give out, they affect other people and if you do or say something aggressive, it has a way of coming back. But when you become more positive, you feel more balanced, more open to people, more understanding of others and you see their value. I suppose I've just accepted how I am. Of course there are days when you feel shit, but if you accept it and have the faith that it's going to get better, then it starts to change. </p> <p>It's been magical really, and comes through when I'm composing, so it's helped my music career. The healing part of Qi Gong also gives me great satisfaction, I do one-to-one teaching but I now want to push the practice out to a wider audience. I'm working on a project so that people can benefit from Qi Gong through the internet (<a href=\"http://www.mezzowave.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.mezzowave.com</a>), video and live performance. I know this may open me to cynics, but I see it as a test. Now I'm just enjoying what I have and living in the moment. I've got a good message to give to other people, that of happiness and goodwill - it's just up to them to accept it.</p> <p><b>Faith Buck, artist, 29</b></p> <p> I spent three years in college studying graphic design. I thought this would be the best route to a creative career: I'd be a qualified graphic designer and somebody would employ me. But it didn't work out like that. After college I spent 18 months on the dole, then went through a variety of poorly paid, mundane jobs. I'd get ill frequently and it didn't help that I didn't get sick pay. </p> <p>In May this year I went on a cycling holiday in Lefkada, Greece.

      "bodyText": "Lorraine Tapper, social worker, 45 There wasn't anything specific that made me go into therapy, my whole life just didn't seem to be working out. It was a combination of factors: career, money, bad relationships. Being unhappy was a dominant theme for me. I really wasn't enjoying my life and it probably was pretty miserable for people to be around me. I was shy, afraid, angry and resentful - all these things that I just didn't want to be. Then I saw an ad for a one-day self-development course run by Christene Burgess who works from London's Ability Centre. The self-esteem course helped me see I could do things differently, so I decided to have one-to-one therapy. It took a while to work because I was still very resistant. I'd had a lot of years of being scared and sad, and there wasn't going to be an immediate solution. I'd been in therapy for about a year and a half when a friend recommended the Life Training programme in Belsize Park. I did one of the weekend workshops and it was a real eye-opener. We did a lot of partnership work in a variety of situations - on the course they teach you that people are your mirrors - they give you feedback and that, in turn, gives you opportunity for growth. One of the biggest things I learnt was how to deal with resentment. My father had been dead for 22 years and I was still angry with him for being strict with me as a child. One of the processes they teach you is how by holding that resentment, it affects your life and not the life of the person you're holding that resentment for. Knowing my part in my unhappiness meant that I could choose to be different. I used to be angry all the time, rigid - I was always right, everyone was always wrong. Before, I wouldn't let people see me upset, sad or vulnerable, now I realise the strength in having all my emotions. A few months ago a male client came into the office ranting and raving. At one time I'd have been defensive and stressed by the situation. Now I was able to see in front of me a man who was very hurt, very scared and frightened. I let him say what he had to say, and he really calmed down. I'm now developing my own business as a personal life coach. Before I'd only be happy if I'd got the right job, the right boyfriend. Now I'm just happy because I'm alive. I've found my sense of self and become a rounded person who makes a contribution to the world, whether it's through work, relationships or my teaching. And I've discovered that real happiness isn't attached to external things, it's an internal way of being. Max Mezzowave, composer, 34 At 24, I was a complete stress victim. I worked as a courier, driving around London in the rush hour. I was very aggressive. I also used to go out drinking and partying every night. I was incredibly self-destructive and I'd rely on drink as an escape. I was in huge debt. I was almost in the gutter, living in bedsits and bumming around on people's floors. As a result, I wasn't very healthy either. In truth, I wasn't a desirable person. I was very depressed with myself, I felt I had an ability to do more with my life. Luckily, someone came along at the right time to point me in the right direction. Ironically, it was a person I'd met in a bar. She told me about sahaja yoga and meditation. Sahaja yoga focuses on the Indian philosophy of the seven chakras in your body; you meditate while someone heals you. I started to see the benefits straightaway. It was the first time I'd felt relaxed in a while. After five years, I moved on to the Chinese practice of Qi Gong. This is similar in that through movement and exercise, an instructor will give you the 'software' to channel your energy. When you reflect and expand on that, it's possible to become completely harmonised with your surroundings. Both yoga and Qi Gong have benefited me in lots of ways; I'm much calmer and more at peace with myself. I've started to understand what I'm about as a person, that whatever your actions give out, they affect other people and if you do or say something aggressive, it has a way of coming back. But when you become more positive, you feel more balanced, more open to people, more understanding of others and you see their value. I suppose I've just accepted how I am. Of course there are days when you feel shit, but if you accept it and have the faith that it's going to get better, then it starts to change. It's been magical really, and comes through when I'm composing, so it's helped my music career. The healing part of Qi Gong also gives me great satisfaction, I do one-to-one teaching but I now want to push the practice out to a wider audience. I'm working on a project so that people can benefit from Qi Gong through the internet (www.mezzowave.com), video and live performance. I know this may open me to cynics, but I see it as a test. Now I'm just enjoying what I have and living in the moment. I've got a good message to give to other people, that of happiness and goodwill - it's just up to them to accept it. Faith Buck, artist, 29 I spent three years in college studying graphic design. I thought this would be the best route to a creative career: I'd be a qualified graphic designer and somebody would employ me. But it didn't work out like that. After college I spent 18 months on the dole, then went through a variety of poorly paid, mundane jobs. I'd get ill frequently and it didn't help that I didn't get sick pay. In May this year I went on a cycling holiday in Lefkada, Greece. It was a tremendously special place, really uplifting for the soul. I was telling everyone I was an artist, even though I wasn't drawing anything. It was then that I decided to rediscover my creativity. My main problem had been getting my artwork seen. I hadn't knocked on too many doors and the few times I had, it had been so discouraging. I can't motivate myself; there has to be a reason for drawing a picture, so I set up the drawing room website (www.the-drawing-room.org.uk). All I wanted was ideas to unblock my creativity. I say to people, 'What do you want a picture of and I'll draw it?' I don't charge: I want the ideas to be free-flowing and I thought asking for money would put people off.

I used to doubt my abilities, but the positive responses I've had to my pictures have added to my self-esteem and confidence. It's gratifying when people turn round and say you've correctly interpreted how they feel. Or that you've added something to their perception of things.

      "body": "<p>Am I happy? Why can't I be happy? Shouldn't I be happier than I am? These are questions that nowadays plague us. In past centuries, people worried about dying and whether they would go to heaven, but nobody worries about heaven any more; we want to be happy now. Until therapists came along and told us to talk about our feelings, people rarely talked about being happy or unhappy. In most of the years I have been alive - I was born in 1930 - most people were unhappy and many depressed, but they kept their feelings to themselves. Nowadays, a particular feature of the baby boomers and those younger is that they talk about happiness, and their lack of it, all the time.</p> <p>We like to think that suffering ennobles us and gives us distinction, and so we like to think that previous generations had happier lives than we do. When Oliver James says, in Britain on the Couch, that in the 1950s people were happier than they are today, he is talking sentimental nonsense. The 50s were very tough and for many of us just plain horrible. I know, because I was there. I would much rather be in my twenties now than, as I was, in my twenties in the 50s.</p> <p>In those years, women's magazines were devoted to instructing women how to make their husbands happy. There was no advice about how a woman could make herself happy, except by being a devoted wife and mother. Now magazines overflow with advice about how we can spend every moment of our lives achieving happiness. Unhappiness has become unacceptable. We often feel so overwhelmed by the endless bad news the media brings us that we turn away from any mention of misery. Moreover, we believe that if we are happy we will be seen as successful. Thus the word 'sad', which refers to the appropriate emotion to follow loss or disappointment, is used derogatively. 'He's a sad guy. He ought to get a life' is a major condemnation. Depression, once a state of mind of which to be ashamed, is less stigmatised, but it is discussed endlessly and described as a vast epidemic sweeping the planet, while the words 'depressed' and 'depression' are applied to any dysphoric feeling such as unhappiness, disappointment, lack of enthusiasm, even irritability.</p> <p>Over the years that happiness and unhappiness emerged from the shadows and became major topics of discussion and anxiety, I had to deal with happiness and unhappiness in my personal life and in my professional life as a clinical psychologist. I became an expert in my own personal happiness, and, although I cannot tell you exactly how to go about being happy, I can certainly tell you how to stop yourself from being happy. And if you can practise not stopping yourself from being happy, there is a good chance that you will be happy.</p> <p>I spent the first 40 years of my life being unhappy. There were bursts of happiness, usually associated with my son or with places I visited, but there was a leaden quality to my life, as if it were a permanent rainy day. I became happy very slowly, and did not realise that this was happening until one summer day in 1975, when I was walking across an ordinary stretch of grass. I looked down and saw little white daisies rising up from the grass, as if they were floating and dancing. I had been so busy establishing and then heading a new department of clinical psychology in Lincolnshire, I had not noticed that I was changing. The 1970s were what I now call the golden age of clinical psychology in the UK. Then we were not yet ground down by managers who cared about money but not people, and there was money available for us to study the new therapeutic techniques that were being developed and that changed us as much as they changed our clients.</p> <p>My unhappiness must have started not long after I was born to a depressed mother. Recent research on the interaction between depressed mothers and their newborn babies shows that a baby is keenly aware when a mother does not respond in the way that the baby wants and needs. After repeated failures to attract the mother's attention, the baby gives up trying and becomes distressed.</p> <p>This was the pattern not just of my babyhood but also my childhood. I loved my mother and wanted to gain her loving attention, but I could never please her. In no uncertain terms, she let me know that I was fat, ugly and lazy and that I irritated her with my cough. The fact that I had a lung disease, now diagnosed as bronchiectasis, which required me to cough in order to breathe, and which caused periods of intense physical weakness, passed her by. Unfortunately, there are many people like my mother who are so wrapped up in themselves that they are quite unable to give their children the unconditional love that all children need in order to keep that sense of being valuable and acceptable with which they are born. Like all small children deprived of unconditional love, I could explain my situation in only one way - there was something about me which was wrong, bad, unacceptable. The fault was in my essence and could not be eradicated.</p> <p>Likewise, my friend Jack decided as a child, as many children do, that the disappointments, losses and betrayals he had suffered at the hands of adults were his own fault because he was not good enough. As an adult, he presented himself as cool and self-confident, but inside was a worm of self-doubt. However, he made life much harder for himself because he habitually thought in particular ways; he could never admit that he was wrong in anything, because doing that made him feel weak and vulnerable, yet at the same time he criticised himself harshly and endlessly. He was sure that he did not deserve to be successful and therefore happy. Like many people, Jack was a confirmed pessimist, believing that it is better to expect little and avoid the pain of disappointment. Moreover, he believed that worrying about something prevented it happening. He would complain to me that, with his success in his chosen field, he ought to be happy, but, as I would point out to him, thinking as he did, how could he be happy?</p> <p>The turning point in my life came when the intellectual knowledge I had as a psychologist, that I actually could eradicate my self-doubt and instead value and accept myself, became knowledge of the heart and not just the head. A frequent theme in my books is why people refuse to let such knowledge into their hearts. If you have built your whole life on doubting your self-worth, then learning to value and accept yourself will change everything - how you think, how you get on with people, the choices you make. Change creates uncertainty, and uncertainty creates fear. Frightened of change, many people choose to stay with the devil they know, and so they remain unhappy.</p> <p>If you do decide to change, you have to set out on a journey that only you can make. There are no maps. Gurus like me can only tell you about their journey, and perhaps you might be helped by that. We can always learn from other people's stories. As a psychologist, I had the privilege of listening to many different stories, and, as I did, I learned a great deal about my clients, but I learned even more about myself. The question that fascinated me was not why my client had become depressed, or obsessional, or psychotic - as their story unfolded that was easy to see - but why I had not fallen into any of those dreaded states.</p> <p>Many of my clients had had childhoods far worse than mine, but equally many had had childhoods little different from mine - my mother was by no means unique. During my first job in England, as I listened to these clients, I became aware that, despite similar upbringings, they often had ideas and responses that were profoundly different from mine. I wanted to research this.</p> <p>Fortunately for me, a major shift in the way research in psychology is done was under way in the 1960s. Instead of having to study large groups of people, it was now becoming scientifically respectable to study individuals, which was what I wanted to do. Also, one of my colleagues, Don Bannister, had just come back from the USA with a new psychological theory and research method - George Kelly's Personal Construct Theory and repertory grids - which I could use. For 10 years, I did academic research and wrote academic papers, but burying my results in academic journals helped no one. I began to write books that everyone could read.</p> <p>George Kelly had not discovered something new but had simply repackaged what the ancient Greek philosopher Epictetus had said, 'It is not things in themselves that trouble us but our opinion of things.' It is not what happens to you that leads you to be happy or unhappy, but rather how you interpret what happens to you. It was my interpretation of what had happened to me that led to my being a psychologist and not to being a patient in a psychiatric clinic. As a small child, I realised that, if I were to survive, I had to discover why my mother behaved as she did. I did not hear the word 'psychologist' until I was 15, but I had been one all those years.</p> <p>I certainly had not heard of Epictetus, but I did know what Epictetus knew. I could easily see that, whatever occurred, my mother would interpret it pessimistically, my father optimistically, while I had my own interpretation, and my sister had hers. How we interpreted an event determined what each of us did next. I was very fortunate, in that my parents' example didn't teach me that there is only one way to interpret events. This can result in growing up to believe that the world is only as we see it, and when we are too fixed as a person in this way, we soon get into difficulties, because events keep disconfirming our expectations. If you want to be very unhappy, spend your life insisting that you are right and everyone else is wrong.</p> <p>When we are forced by circumstances to live and work in ways that bring us little joy, we need to protect ourselves against a sense of unending misery by putting into every day some little activity which we enjoy. If we can concentrate on carrying out that activity and not think about matters outside of what we are doing, we create the circumstances where happiness can arise. As a child, I would go for a swim, and I knew that if I concentrated on the shape of the next wave and how I would catch it, I forgot about the miseries of home and school and I would feel happy. Later, as a psychologist, I came to see that happiness is an emotion like all other emotions - a by-product of an experience. We cannot will an emotion into being. You can be angry only when you are angry. You can be happy only when you are happy.</p> <p>And happiness, like other emotions, comes in different strengths - from mild contentment to ecstatic joy. Instead of enjoying whatever strength of happiness they feel, though, some people destroy this feeling by worrying that they ought to be happier. They forget that we cannot physically sustain any strong emotion for any length of time, and that a lasting sense of mild contentment makes life so much easier. Equally, whenever we get angry or frightened, or hate someone, or feel shame or guilt, it is extremely important to ask ourselves whether the strength of the emotion we feel is an appropriate response to what has happened. Getting wildly angry over something you would ordinarily find mildly irritating shows that there is something amiss in your life.</p> <p>Many people are confused about unhappiness. How much should they bear? When does it become unhealthy? Unhappiness, like happiness, is an emotion, and it arises from how we interpret an event. Often people will seek to shame us for being insufficiently distressed - as my cat-loving friend often seeks to do to me when a moggy dies - and at the same time people will criticise us for not getting over a disaster quickly enough. Fearing unhappiness, many people fail to recognise that there are losses that we can never get over completely, even though the pain might lessen with time. These are losses for which there can be no replacement or recompense, and to which unhappiness is an entirely rational response. We can replace a television set or even a flooded house, but we cannot replace someone we love who has died.</p> <p>I have heard a professor of psychiatry declare that the appropriate length of time to mourn one's parents is two years. Any longer, and mourning is the symptom of depression known as 'irrational grief'. So much nonsense is talked about depression that it is no wonder that people get confused about what is unhappiness and what is depression. Yet the two states are very distinct. In our society, it is easy to become depressed because our culture teaches us that to be good we have to accept responsibility for whatever goes wrong. Someone bumps into you in the street and you say, 'Sorry'. Through the incompetence of the managers, your firm goes bust, and you, a worker, feel that you are to blame. If you want to turn your unhappiness into depression, all that you have to do is to blame yourself for the disaster that has befallen you. You will know when you are depressed, because you will feel that you are utterly alone, locked in some kind of prison. When you are unhappy, no matter how great your suffering, other people can comfort you and you can comfort yourself, but when you are depressed you feel nothing of the comfort people give you, and you treat yourself as your own worst enemy.</p> <p>Depression, unhappiness and happiness can be understood and dealt with only by understanding how we each interpret ourselves and our world. We create our own individual interpretations, and our interpretations determine what we do and feel. We cannot always change what is happening to us, but we are always free to change how we interpret what is happening to us.</p> <p>People are able to be much happier now than they were when I was young, because we can know so much more now about ourselves, because we are prepared to discuss these matters among ourselves, sharing and changing our ideas. I was lucky enough to be able to do this, and slowly I found that the accompanying feeling to my life changed from unhappiness to happiness. I wish I could do this for every unhappy person, but it is something we each have to do for ourselves. If we want to, we can.</p> <p><b>Towards a brighter future: Five steps to a happier life</b></p> <p>It will help you be happy if you bear in mind the following:</p> <p>1 Happiness is not a goal to be achieved, but an emotion that is a by-product of what you do.</p> <p>2 Thinking in terms of whether you deserve or don't deserve to be happy will stop you being happy.</p> <p>3 There is nothing wrong with feeling sad, which is the appropriate emotion to feel after you have suffered a loss or disappointment.</p> <p>4 Depression is not just being very unhappy. We become depressed when we blame ourselves for the disaster that has befallen us. Being depressed means feeling that you are utterly alone, locked into some kind of horrible prison, where no comfort can reach you and you will not comfort yourself.</p> <p>5 To create the conditions whereby happiness can blossom you have to do some or all of the following:</p> <p>\u0095 Understand that what you do is a result of how you have interpreted what happens, and that you are free to change your interpretations.</p> <p>\u0095 See yourself as valuable and acceptable. To do this, you may have to review your childhood and recognise that as a child you came to the conclusion that you must have been bad and unacceptable, otherwise the adults around you would not have treated you as they did. Look at this now from an adult's perspective.</p> <p>\u0095 Listen to how you talk to yourself and, if you are constantly criticising yourself and making impossible demands on yourself, stop doing it. Be your own best friend.</p> <p>\u0095 Cultivate the ability to live in the present, paying attention only to what is going on around you. By fretting about what has happened in the past and anxiously planning the future, we inevitably shut ourselves off from a great source of happiness - that of fully experiencing what is before us.</p> <p>\u0095 Use the ability to be in the present by, every day, giving yourself some little treat or reward. Do not do this because you deserve it, but because it's a nice thing to do.</p>",

Likewise, my friend Jack decided as a child, as many children do, that the disappointments, losses and betrayals he had suffered at the hands of adults were his own fault because he was not good enough. As an adult, he presented himself as cool and self-confident, but inside was a worm of self-doubt. However, he made life much harder for himself because he habitually thought in particular ways; he could never admit that he was wrong in anything, because doing that made him feel weak and vulnerable, yet at the same time he criticised himself harshly and endlessly. He was sure that he did not deserve to be successful and therefore happy. Like many people, Jack was a confirmed pessimist, believing that it is better to expect little and avoid the pain of disappointment. Moreover, he believed that worrying about something prevented it happening. He would complain to me that, with his success in his chosen field, he ought to be happy, but, as I would point out to him, thinking as he did, how could he be happy? The turning point in my life came when the intellectual knowledge I had as a psychologist, that I actually could eradicate my self-doubt and instead value and accept myself, became knowledge of the heart and not just the head. A frequent theme in my books is why people refuse to let such knowledge into their hearts. If you have built your whole life on doubting your self-worth, then learning to value and accept yourself will change everything - how you think, how you get on with people, the choices you make. Change creates uncertainty, and uncertainty creates fear. Frightened of change, many people choose to stay with the devil they know, and so they remain unhappy. If you do decide to change, you have to set out on a journey that only you can make. There are no maps. Gurus like me can only tell you about their journey, and perhaps you might be helped by that. We can always learn from other people's stories. As a psychologist, I had the privilege of listening to many different stories, and, as I did, I learned a great deal about my clients, but I learned even more about myself. The question that fascinated me was not why my client had become depressed, or obsessional, or psychotic - as their story unfolded that was easy to see - but why I had not fallen into any of those dreaded states. Many of my clients had had childhoods far worse than mine, but equally many had had childhoods little different from mine - my mother was by no means unique. During my first job in England, as I listened to these clients, I became aware that, despite similar upbringings, they often had ideas and responses that were profoundly different from mine. I wanted to research this. Fortunately for me, a major shift in the way research in psychology is done was under way in the 1960s. Instead of having to study large groups of people, it was now becoming scientifically respectable to study individuals, which was what I wanted to do. Also, one of my colleagues, Don Bannister, had just come back from the USA with a new psychological theory and research method - George Kelly's Personal Construct Theory and repertory grids - which I could use. For 10 years, I did academic research and wrote academic papers, but burying my results in academic journals helped no one. I began to write books that everyone could read. George Kelly had not discovered something new but had simply repackaged what the ancient Greek philosopher Epictetus had said, 'It is not things in themselves that trouble us but our opinion of things.' It is not what happens to you that leads you to be happy or unhappy, but rather how you interpret what happens to you. It was my interpretation of what had happened to me that led to my being a psychologist and not to being a patient in a psychiatric clinic. As a small child, I realised that, if I were to survive, I had to discover why my mother behaved as she did. I did not hear the word 'psychologist' until I was 15, but I had been one all those years. I certainly had not heard of Epictetus, but I did know what Epictetus knew. I could easily see that, whatever occurred, my mother would interpret it pessimistically, my father optimistically, while I had my own interpretation, and my sister had hers. How we interpreted an event determined what each of us did next. I was very fortunate, in that my parents' example didn't teach me that there is only one way to interpret events. This can result in growing up to believe that the world is only as we see it, and when we are too fixed as a person in this way, we soon get into difficulties, because events keep disconfirming our expectations. If you want to be very unhappy, spend your life insisting that you are right and everyone else is wrong. When we are forced by circumstances to live and work in ways that bring us little joy, we need to protect ourselves against a sense of unending misery by putting into every day some little activity which we enjoy. If we can concentrate on carrying out that activity and not think about matters outside of what we are doing, we create the circumstances where happiness can arise. As a child, I would go for a swim, and I knew that if I concentrated on the shape of the next wave and how I would catch it, I forgot about the miseries of home and school and I would feel happy. Later, as a psychologist, I came to see that happiness is an emotion like all other emotions - a by-product of an experience. We cannot will an emotion into being. You can be angry only when you are angry. You can be happy only when you are happy. And happiness, like other emotions, comes in different strengths - from mild contentment to ecstatic joy. Instead of enjoying whatever strength of happiness they feel, though, some people destroy this feeling by worrying that they ought to be happier. They forget that we cannot physically sustain any strong emotion for any length of time, and that a lasting sense of mild contentment makes life so much easier. Equally, whenever we get angry or frightened, or hate someone, or feel shame or guilt, it is extremely important to ask ourselves whether the strength of the emotion we feel is an appropriate response to what has happened. Getting wildly angry over something you would ordinarily find mildly irritating shows that there is something amiss in your life. Many people are confused about unhappiness. How much should they bear? When does it become unhealthy? Unhappiness, like happiness, is an emotion, and it arises from how we interpret an event. Often people will seek to shame us for being insufficiently distressed - as my cat-loving friend often seeks to do to me when a moggy dies - and at the same time people will criticise us for not getting over a disaster quickly enough. Fearing unhappiness, many people fail to recognise that there are losses that we can never get over completely, even though the pain might lessen with time. These are losses for which there can be no replacement or recompense, and to which unhappiness is an entirely rational response. We can replace a television set or even a flooded house, but we cannot replace someone we love who has died. I have heard a professor of psychiatry declare that the appropriate length of time to mourn one's parents is two years. Any longer, and mourning is the symptom of depression known as 'irrational grief'. So much nonsense is talked about depression that it is no wonder that people get confused about what is unhappiness and what is depression. Yet the two states are very distinct. In our society, it is easy to become depressed because our culture teaches us that to be good we have to accept responsibility for whatever goes wrong. Someone bumps into you in the street and you say, 'Sorry'. Through the incompetence of the managers, your firm goes bust, and you, a worker, feel that you are to blame. If you want to turn your unhappiness into depression, all that you have to do is to blame yourself for the disaster that has befallen you. You will know when you are depressed, because you will feel that you are utterly alone, locked in some kind of prison. When you are unhappy, no matter how great your suffering, other people can comfort you and you can comfort yourself, but when you are depressed you feel nothing of the comfort people give you, and you treat yourself as your own worst enemy. Depression, unhappiness and happiness can be understood and dealt with only by understanding how we each interpret ourselves and our world. We create our own individual interpretations, and our interpretations determine what we do and feel. We cannot always change what is happening to us, but we are always free to change how we interpret what is happening to us. People are able to be much happier now than they were when I was young, because we can know so much more now about ourselves, because we are prepared to discuss these matters among ourselves, sharing and changing our ideas. I was lucky enough to be able to do this, and slowly I found that the accompanying feeling to my life changed from unhappiness to happiness. I wish I could do this for every unhappy person, but it is something we each have to do for ourselves. If we want to, we can. Towards a brighter future: Five steps to a happier life It will help you be happy if you bear in mind the following: 1 Happiness is not a goal to be achieved, but an emotion that is a by-product of what you do. 2 Thinking in terms of whether you deserve or don't deserve to be happy will stop you being happy. 3 There is nothing wrong with feeling sad, which is the appropriate emotion to feel after you have suffered a loss or disappointment. 4 Depression is not just being very unhappy. We become depressed when we blame ourselves for the disaster that has befallen us. Being depressed means feeling that you are utterly alone, locked into some kind of horrible prison, where no comfort can reach you and you will not comfort yourself. 5 To create the conditions whereby happiness can blossom you have to do some or all of the following: \u0095 Understand that what you do is a result of how you have interpreted what happens, and that you are free to change your interpretations. \u0095 See yourself as valuable and acceptable. To do this, you may have to review your childhood and recognise that as a child you came to the conclusion that you must have been bad and unacceptable, otherwise the adults around you would not have treated you as they did. Look at this now from an adult's perspective. \u0095 Listen to how you talk to yourself and, if you are constantly criticising yourself and making impossible demands on yourself, stop doing it. Be your own best friend. \u0095 Cultivate the ability to live in the present, paying attention only to what is going on around you. By fretting about what has happened in the past and anxiously planning the future, we inevitably shut ourselves off from a great source of happiness - that of fully experiencing what is before us. \u0095 Use the ability to be in the present by, every day, giving yourself some little treat or reward. Do not do this because you deserve it, but because it's a nice thing to do.",

And, of course, there's that contradictory appeal of revealing something not meant to be seen.' This isn't the first time Thompson has unintentionally turned an innocent pastime into a major art project. A liking for the 1970s-style logo found on board games by the now defunct company Philmar Ltd resulted in Thompson picking up its jigsaws from second-hand stores. Initially completing and framing them, 130 or so puzzles down the line, Thompson now photographs them, documents them in his Philmar booklet and returns them to the second-hand recycling system. He's even applied to pay up the \u00a3200 it would cost to own the Philmar logo. If he's successful there could be Philmar T-shirts and embroidered patches in the offing and maybe even a future show of things not meant to be worn. \u0095 Works Not To Be Shown: 1-80 starts on Wednesday 13 December and runs until Saturday 6 January 2001 at the Mobile Home Gallery, 3rd Floor, 42 Theobalds Road, London WC1 (020 7405 7575). Open Monday to Saturday, 12-6pm. Admission free",

This weekend there is little reassurance to be gleaned from this national institution so beloved of well-heeled, middle-class investors. The firm that proclaims its age so proudly on its literature - 'founded in 1762' - announced plans last Friday to close to new business. Equitable remains solvent, but now exists only to wind down its remaining policies and meet its existing obligations. This could take 30 years, as some policyholders will be young people who recently started pensions. The company acknowledged that its returns will probably suffer because its with-profits fund 'will need to be invested to a greater extent in bonds and gilts rather than equities, which historically have generated higher returns in the longer term'. Insurers can spread their risk heavily into equities only if they are generating new business, particularly long-term pension business where the risks can be divided between thousands of new policyholders and over an unending time span. Most of Equitable's 500,000 policyholders will be free to move their funds, although the firm has said it will apply a 10 per cent deduction by taking advantage of the 'market value adjustment' rules, which let insurers penalise leavers to help protect policyholders who stay.

      "body": "<p>On Tuesday evening at London's Park Lane Hilton a man in a dinner jacket and a bow tie navigated a course between the tables of his well-dined peers, stepped into the sweaty spotlight and accepted his outfit's award as company of the year.</p> <p>So what, you may think. These sort of junkets go on in scores of venues, night after night. Jolly good for Moss Bros's business and extremely enjoyable for those with a penchant for warm chablis and cold beef wellington.</p> <p>OK, so he was handed the award by Ian Hislop, editor of Private Eye and panellist on BBC's Have I Got News For You. </p> <p>Rather swankier than collecting a trophy from, say, local radio's Simon Bates or the editor of Company Car Driver.</p> <p>But the status of the celebrity is no surprise because the Growing Business Awards were jointly presented by the CBI, Britain's premier industrial organisation. And you can see why this man's firm deserved its gong. 'Rapid growth since its inception just five years ago ... The past 18 months has seen its turnover rise from \u00a37 million to \u00a340m - a staggering 471 per cent increase,' exulted the subsequent press release.</p> <p>No, the surprise is this model company's identity - Claims Direct. You may not have come across this thrusting operation unless you watch daytime television - where its commercials are ubiquitous. The press release, somewhat managerially, refers to this as 'accessibility of the product to its customer base'. </p> <p>And what is that customer base? The victims of personal injury, whom Claims Direct invites to call it on a 'No win, no fee' basis to seek compensation. The company is not a firm of lawyers; rather, it passes respondents on to solicitors who pay Claims Direct a fee. And the company also sells its customers an insurance policy for \u00a31,350 - to cover legal costs if they lose. Set aside the fact that this may seem to sit oddly with the 'no fee' slogan - and the fact that Claims Direct has attracted a certain amount of unfavourable publicity - even from 'victorious' customers complaining that they could not recover the insurance cost and were left with very little compensation.</p> <p>Let us assume that the company has helped lots of little people win redress for the pain they suffered. Even so, what it amounts to is that the CBI's company of the year is, effectively, an ambulance chaser.</p> <p>Were there no innovative manufacturers available for consideration? If not, what does this tell us, and the Confederation, about the state of British industry?</p> <p>Of course, we all accept that profit is the bottom line - without it we'd be down the Swanee, or perhaps the Tyne. Capital no longer has to battle for the hearts and minds of the people against red-blooded socialism. But it should be aware of the picture it presents. The fact that its award winners are completely above board is not enough.</p> <p>The title 'company director' has never commanded instant respect. In my youth a high proportion of the defendants in cases of armed robbery were described as company directors (often, for some reason, from Essex). </p> <p>A sceptical public has watched and detested as the privatisation 'fat cats' lined their pockets, and is now more than half-convinced that, left to their own devices, railway and airline chiefs would always put profit before safety.</p> <p>We love business: we know it's the only way. But we have to at least try to help the rest of the population to agree.</p> <p>Oh yes, and in case you thought this year's award was a solitary publicity mistake, guess who picked up a gong last year? Martha Lane Fox. And how does that play to the gallery now the shares have so mightily fallen.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On Tuesday evening at London's Park Lane Hilton a man in a dinner jacket and a bow tie navigated a course between the tables of his well-dined peers, stepped into the sweaty spotlight and accepted his outfit's award as company of the year. So what, you may think. These sort of junkets go on in scores of venues, night after night. Jolly good for Moss Bros's business and extremely enjoyable for those with a penchant for warm chablis and cold beef wellington. OK, so he was handed the award by Ian Hislop, editor of Private Eye and panellist on BBC's Have I Got News For You. Rather swankier than collecting a trophy from, say, local radio's Simon Bates or the editor of Company Car Driver. But the status of the celebrity is no surprise because the Growing Business Awards were jointly presented by the CBI, Britain's premier industrial organisation. And you can see why this man's firm deserved its gong. 'Rapid growth since its inception just five years ago ... The past 18 months has seen its turnover rise from \u00a37 million to \u00a340m - a staggering 471 per cent increase,' exulted the subsequent press release. No, the surprise is this model company's identity - Claims Direct. You may not have come across this thrusting operation unless you watch daytime television - where its commercials are ubiquitous. The press release, somewhat managerially, refers to this as 'accessibility of the product to its customer base'. And what is that customer base? The victims of personal injury, whom Claims Direct invites to call it on a 'No win, no fee' basis to seek compensation. The company is not a firm of lawyers; rather, it passes respondents on to solicitors who pay Claims Direct a fee. And the company also sells its customers an insurance policy for \u00a31,350 - to cover legal costs if they lose. Set aside the fact that this may seem to sit oddly with the 'no fee' slogan - and the fact that Claims Direct has attracted a certain amount of unfavourable publicity - even from 'victorious' customers complaining that they could not recover the insurance cost and were left with very little compensation. Let us assume that the company has helped lots of little people win redress for the pain they suffered. Even so, what it amounts to is that the CBI's company of the year is, effectively, an ambulance chaser. Were there no innovative manufacturers available for consideration? If not, what does this tell us, and the Confederation, about the state of British industry? Of course, we all accept that profit is the bottom line - without it we'd be down the Swanee, or perhaps the Tyne. Capital no longer has to battle for the hearts and minds of the people against red-blooded socialism. But it should be aware of the picture it presents. The fact that its award winners are completely above board is not enough. The title 'company director' has never commanded instant respect. In my youth a high proportion of the defendants in cases of armed robbery were described as company directors (often, for some reason, from Essex). A sceptical public has watched and detested as the privatisation 'fat cats' lined their pockets, and is now more than half-convinced that, left to their own devices, railway and airline chiefs would always put profit before safety. We love business: we know it's the only way. But we have to at least try to help the rest of the population to agree. Oh yes, and in case you thought this year's award was a solitary publicity mistake, guess who picked up a gong last year? Martha Lane Fox. And how does that play to the gallery now the shares have so mightily fallen.",

      "body": "<p>At eight o'clock on Friday night Tony Blair and Robin Cook were ushered towards President Chirac's suite of offices at the Acropolis Centre in Nice. They would have 20 minutes to speak to the French president and Lionel Jospin, the prime minister.</p> <p>In that 20 minutes Britain was being asked to lay out its final negotiating position in Europe's most important summit in a generation - one that would define the future shape and scope of the goverance of an enlarged European Union.</p> <p>With Blair and Cook was Sir Stephen Wall, the head of the Cabinet Office European Secretariat and the man brought to Downing Street by Blair to give Number 10 a bit of European backbone.</p> <p>Chirac began the meeting by asking what Britain's final position was on the Nice summit. Blair once again went through the so-called 'six red lines', the six areas where Britain would not budge on giving up its veto in Europe, including the three most problematic: tax, social security and border issues. Britain was not bluffing, Chirac was told. There would be no compromise on these issues.</p> <p>At 8.20pm Chirac thanked the men for coming and brought the meeting to a close. It was one of 15 meetings Chirac was to have that night, 'the confessionals' where each of the members of the European Union would lay down their 'non-negotiable' position.</p> <p>Blair and Cook returned to their hotel, the West End, near the sea front. They knew the meeting they had just had with Chirac was a 'biding time' meeting. The real battle would commence in the morning.</p> <p>At 7.30am the redrafted treaty was delivered to them, written overnight by French officials. It was supposed to take into account everybody's 'red lines' so carefully explained the night before. Over breakfast, Cook and his officials went through the draft page by page. On the European Commission, Britain was relaxed about plans to reduce the number of commissioners for the big countries from two to one. On the issue of the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers, the key decision-making body in the EU, Britain was happy with plans to increase the overall number of votes and give Britain proportionally more power in the council. Britain's parity with Germany was also maintained.</p> <p>But then came page two and two phrases neither Cook nor Blair wanted to see - social affairs and tax. Two of Britain's red lines had been breached: indirect taxation would be discussed without a British veto in five years' time and social security schemes would be 'co-ordinated' by the EU.</p> <p>Blair and Cook met to discuss the document. In an hour's time would be the first meeting of the heads of government in the Acropolis Centre. They would have to make it clear that there was no room for manoeuvre.</p> <p>At 9.30am the heads of government meeting began. and it was immediately clear that it was not only Britain that was having problems.</p> <p>Portugal's Prime Minister Antonio Guterres condemned it as 'an institutional coup d'\u00e9tat'. Ireland's Bertie Ahern was described as going 'ballistic'over the abandonment of the national veto over some areas of taxation - a no-go area for the Irish and Luxembourg as well as Britain.</p> <p>The small states were especially outraged by a French proposal to reweight votes in the EU's decision-making Council of Ministers so that three big states and one small one could block any decision.</p> <p>Among the few EU leaders who did not reject the draft out of hand was Germany's Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who said simply that more work had to be done. The reason that Schroeder was so sanguine was straightforward. Schr\u00f6der and Chirac - both staying at Nice's smartest hotel, the Negresco - had sat up into the small hours on Saturday discussing possible compromises.</p> <p>As Chirac went around the room, delegation after delegation made it clear that the lat est French version of the treaty was doomed to failure.</p> <p>And among the British delegation, Blair and Cook knew that, even if they were isolated, they had to make it clear that they were willing to risk the whole summit, and with it the whole of the French EU presidency, rather than bend on their red lines. 'We know that Blair cannot go back to the House of Commons and sell what he has at the moment to the British people,' said a senior French official.</p> <p>Now with the summit deadlocked, questions are already being asked over the way Chirac has conducted the treaty negotiations and the summit, amid anger over his highhanded behaviour..</p> <p>And it is not only the Britain and the smaller states who are angry over their treatment by the French leader. Signs of tension were already clear on Friday when Chirac clashed with the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi. When one of Prodi's aides entered the room, Chirac ordered him out, provoking a sharp rejoinder from Prodi: 'I see my civil servants wherever I want and whenever I want,' he is reported to have said.</p> <p>Although the two men appeared at a joint press conference later, Chirac rejected Prodi's offer to attend the bilateral confessionals. Officials suggested that Prodi's absence could damage Chirac's chances of achieving a compromise.</p> <p>But it is not only the French who are being accused of a lack of finesse. It has also emerged that cack-handed diplomatic manoeuvring on Thursday afternoon had put paid to Britain's one firm ally on the social security issue - Denmark. At 4pm, a press officer for the British EU team went over to the Danish press desk and asked the assembled journalists if they would be willing to meet Kim Darroch, director of the Foreign Office EU division, for a briefing.</p> <p>In a highly unusual move, Darroch then came down to the press room and, with a huddle of Danish journalists around him, started briefing against the Danish government on the social security issue, saying that they had got bad legal advice. The Danes went back to their Prime Minister to ask for clarification and were met with astonished and angry rebuttals. The gaffe meant that Britain could no longer count on Denmark as an ally.</p> <p>By lunchtime yesterday it was stalemate. During a short break Hubert V\u00e9drine, the French Foreign Minister, admitted that the situation was 'difficult'.</p> <p>The package can never make everyone happy,' said V\u00e9drine's deputy, Pierre Moscovici. 'We are overstepping some of these lines and compromise means everybody has to give, even on the most sensitive issues of national interest.'</p> <p>V\u00e9drine admitted that such was the failure of the first document, France would have to redraft the treaty again, only hours before the summit was due to end. Other delegations muttered that most of these issues should have been sorted out weeks ago.</p> <p>At 5pm a second draft was drawn up and officials began to prepare to work through the night, trying to find a way through the fog. 'Put it this way,' said one Foreign Office official, 'I've booked my hotel room for one more night.'</p> <p>A third draft was expected in the early hours of this morning. Britain expects the taxation and social security issues to be dropped from the final agreement but not until much later in the negotiations. In his introductory letter to the heads of government, Chirac said that he wanted the summit complete by noon. As they worked through the night, that deadline was becoming ever closer, with the whiff of stalemate still in the air.</p> <p>'I am still confident we will get an agreement,' the Prime Minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said. 'But there are still some difficult areas to deal with.' At breakfast again this morning, Blair and Cook may have some tough negotiating still to do.</p> <p><b>Related special reports</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/IMF\">IMF and World Bank summit in Prague 2000</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/wto/\">World Trade Organisation summit 1999</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/m2k\">May2K demonstrations</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/debt/0,2759,178197,00.html\">Debt relief</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/emu\">Economic and monetary union</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/eurocommission/0,2759,180395,00.html\">European commission</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/europarl/0,2759,180401,00.html\">European parliament</a> <br><br><b>Interactive guide</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/flash/0,5860,408196,00.html\">How the European nations relate to each other</a> <br><br><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.indymedia.org/\" target=\"_new\">Updates from protesters - Indymedia</a> <br><a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/comm/nice_council/index_en.htm\" target=\"_new\">Press release: Nice summit - EU</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Britain was braced for more flood chaos last night as heavy rain and gale force winds threatened to swamp a country already reeling from fierce storms on Friday. </p> <p>A brief respite brought good weather yesterday but was set to change for the worse, with forecasters predicting more bad weather blowing in from the west. </p> <p>'More rain is on the way. Areas at risk of flooding will have to be vigilant - that's anywhere draining off high ground including parts of south Wales, south-west England and Northern Ireland,' said meteorologist Jeremy Plester. </p> <p>The last set of storms that swept across Britain at the end of last week killed four people and brought widespread rail chaos, triggered power cuts in south Wales and created deadly road conditions. At one stage most of west Wales was effectively cut off as two major roads were flooded. </p> <p>However, as well as rendering hundreds homeless and causing millions of pounds of damage, the storms also produced their share of 'Dunkirk spirit' as a beleaguered population came to terms with yet more flooding. </p> <p>In what is thought to be the first operation of its kind in Britain, the Royal Mail rescued three of its postal trains stranded by floods and transported them by road to rail lines unaffected by the rising waters. </p> <p>Three \u00a31 million engines and 18 coaches had been marooned west of Exeter, but after being driven 40 miles up the M5 on low-loader lorries the trains were put back on the railway and were able to continue their journey to deliver sacks full of Christmas post. </p> <p>'The response was an unusual response to an unusual situation,' said a spokesman for English, Welsh and Scottish railways. </p> <p>The operation had lasted throughout Friday night and involved dozens of railway workers, most of whom had volunteered their time for free. </p> <p>Elsewhere, several people were rescued from their cars after getting stuck in flood waters in west Wales, and coastguards and police in wetsuits rescued a man who was stuck up to his waist in mud at a flooded caravan park in Dawlish Warren, Devon. More than 160 people, including pensioners, were eventually evacuated from the site by boat and helicopter after it was cut off by a local river that had burst its banks. </p> <p>Last night the Environment Agency said 102 flood warnings were still in force across England and Wales, but warned that the number could rise as the expected fresh rainfall would boost river levels. In Wales especially people were urged to be on their guard as large swathes of Monmouthshire and west Wales were still under at least a foot of water. </p> <p>Severe flood warnings have been placed on the River Monnow at Skenfrith and Forge Road, and Waterly Lane, Monmouthshire. The River Wye from Hereford to Ross-on-Wye and the River Severn between Bevere and Powick are also on severe alerts. </p> <p>The River Ouse in York, which came within inches of flooding the city's historic centre during last month's floods, peaked yesterday at 13ft above its normal level, but still 5ft below the critical level. Officials said riverside paths in the city were being flooded but there was nothing like the disruption caused in November. </p> <p>Experts believe the coming rains are unlikely to be the last in what is already the wettest autumn since records began. 'I can't see how the situation is going to ease much now until Spring,' said Environment Agency director Archie Robertson. </p> <p>Ben Gill, president of the National Farmers Union, said the disastrous weather could destroy up to five million tonnes of winter cereal crops in yet another blow to an already battered farming industry.</p>",

Areas at risk of flooding will have to be vigilant - that's anywhere draining off high ground including parts of south Wales, south-west England and Northern Ireland,' said meteorologist Jeremy Plester. The last set of storms that swept across Britain at the end of last week killed four people and brought widespread rail chaos, triggered power cuts in south Wales and created deadly road conditions. At one stage most of west Wales was effectively cut off as two major roads were flooded. However, as well as rendering hundreds homeless and causing millions of pounds of damage, the storms also produced their share of 'Dunkirk spirit' as a beleaguered population came to terms with yet more flooding. In what is thought to be the first operation of its kind in Britain, the Royal Mail rescued three of its postal trains stranded by floods and transported them by road to rail lines unaffected by the rising waters. Three \u00a31 million engines and 18 coaches had been marooned west of Exeter, but after being driven 40 miles up the M5 on low-loader lorries the trains were put back on the railway and were able to continue their journey to deliver sacks full of Christmas post. 'The response was an unusual response to an unusual situation,' said a spokesman for English, Welsh and Scottish railways. The operation had lasted throughout Friday night and involved dozens of railway workers, most of whom had volunteered their time for free. Elsewhere, several people were rescued from their cars after getting stuck in flood waters in west Wales, and coastguards and police in wetsuits rescued a man who was stuck up to his waist in mud at a flooded caravan park in Dawlish Warren, Devon. More than 160 people, including pensioners, were eventually evacuated from the site by boat and helicopter after it was cut off by a local river that had burst its banks. Last night the Environment Agency said 102 flood warnings were still in force across England and Wales, but warned that the number could rise as the expected fresh rainfall would boost river levels. In Wales especially people were urged to be on their guard as large swathes of Monmouthshire and west Wales were still under at least a foot of water. Severe flood warnings have been placed on the River Monnow at Skenfrith and Forge Road, and Waterly Lane, Monmouthshire. The River Wye from Hereford to Ross-on-Wye and the River Severn between Bevere and Powick are also on severe alerts. The River Ouse in York, which came within inches of flooding the city's historic centre during last month's floods, peaked yesterday at 13ft above its normal level, but still 5ft below the critical level. Officials said riverside paths in the city were being flooded but there was nothing like the disruption caused in November. Experts believe the coming rains are unlikely to be the last in what is already the wettest autumn since records began. 'I can't see how the situation is going to ease much now until Spring,' said Environment Agency director Archie Robertson. Ben Gill, president of the National Farmers Union, said the disastrous weather could destroy up to five million tonnes of winter cereal crops in yet another blow to an already battered farming industry.",

'Business', 'credit' and 'television' are all included in the recommended modern vocabulary. Old-fashioned aspirations such as charity, equality and tolerance - as well as the specific words 'rights' and 'responsibilities' - do not feature.</p> <p>Blunkett has been determined to force through the introduction of lessons in citizenship since his appointment in 1997. The new curriculum was pioneered by his former politics teacher, Professor Bernard Crick.</p> <p>Crick recommended that 5 per cent of teaching time be devoted to the subject. However, after disputes with teachers, the citizenship curriculum will be compulsory for secondary schools only on its introduction in September 2002. It has been tried out at primary schools in preparation for it to be implemented in them later. Its authors claim it will lead to better behaviour and attendance.</p> <p>Nigel de Gruchy, general-secretary of the teachers' second largest union, the NAS/UWT, said: 'Good schools teach these important issues in a natural way. Compulsion just means more policy statements and meetings and bureaucracy. Why do schools have to be given a whole lot of extra work to do for no particular purpose?'</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the largest union, the National Union of Teachers, said: 'You can still teach right and wrong and involvement in the community across the curriculum. You don't need to be told to cross every I and dot every T by central government. Teachers start griping justifiably when something is imposed on them which they think is a waste of time.</p> <p>'No doubt this will all go off with a huge fanfare. Both this Government and the previous one have been too happy to overload teachers with all sorts of things. But you have to have time to teach.'</p> <p>As they prepare to receive citizenship lessons, British 11-year-olds are still failing to reach key targets in basic subjects. Latest tests show that 28 per cent of children beginning secondary education are not reaching the Government's expected standard in maths, and 25 per cent are failing to achieve an equivalent level in English.</p> <p>Blunkett will unveil the new teaching materials on Wednesday, the same day Home Secretary Jack Straw launches 250,000 Government-funded guides telling children of their entitlements under the new Human Rights Act.</p> <p>Mulligan concedes: 'Seeing the politicians around them, many children will be very cynical about citizenship by the time they're 14 or 15. They've got to learn the lesson that life's like that.'</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk\">ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Old-fashioned aspirations such as charity, equality and tolerance - as well as the specific words 'rights' and 'responsibilities' - do not feature. Blunkett has been determined to force through the introduction of lessons in citizenship since his appointment in 1997. The new curriculum was pioneered by his former politics teacher, Professor Bernard Crick. Crick recommended that 5 per cent of teaching time be devoted to the subject. However, after disputes with teachers, the citizenship curriculum will be compulsory for secondary schools only on its introduction in September 2002. It has been tried out at primary schools in preparation for it to be implemented in them later. Its authors claim it will lead to better behaviour and attendance. Nigel de Gruchy, general-secretary of the teachers' second largest union, the NAS/UWT, said: 'Good schools teach these important issues in a natural way. Compulsion just means more policy statements and meetings and bureaucracy. Why do schools have to be given a whole lot of extra work to do for no particular purpose?' A spokeswoman for the largest union, the National Union of Teachers, said: 'You can still teach right and wrong and involvement in the community across the curriculum. You don't need to be told to cross every I and dot every T by central government. Teachers start griping justifiably when something is imposed on them which they think is a waste of time. 'No doubt this will all go off with a huge fanfare. Both this Government and the previous one have been too happy to overload teachers with all sorts of things. But you have to have time to teach.' As they prepare to receive citizenship lessons, British 11-year-olds are still failing to reach key targets in basic subjects. Latest tests show that 28 per cent of children beginning secondary education are not reaching the Government's expected standard in maths, and 25 per cent are failing to achieve an equivalent level in English. Blunkett will unveil the new teaching materials on Wednesday, the same day Home Secretary Jack Straw launches 250,000 Government-funded guides telling children of their entitlements under the new Human Rights Act. Mulligan concedes: 'Seeing the politicians around them, many children will be very cynical about citizenship by the time they're 14 or 15. They've got to learn the lesson that life's like that.' ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk",

An analysis of voting patterns by the office of the Clerk to the Parliament reveals that another 20 peers voted in fewer than one per cent of divisions. The figures reveal that Tory peers are much less likely to vote in the House of Lords than Labour peers, even though the Conservatives are campaigning strongly not to have the House of Lords abolished. The figures will be seized on to question whether the Lords can claim to represent a wide swathe of public opinion- and how peers see their job. Critics say that the growth of 'empty benches syndrome' in the Lords shows that many members are too old, too ill, or too busy with business and other interests to attend. The trend to appoint younger peers, who have 'day jobs' and young children, may also affect attendance. The voting patterns, analysed for the Labour peer Lord Lipsey, reveal that many of the most famous names in the Lords rarely appear for votes on Government business. Andrew Lloyd-Webber, the theatre tycoon and Conservative peer, voted once once out of 186 votes between November 1999 and the end of the last session of parlia ment - and that was for the Government. Lord Archer, also a Tory peer, appeared for four votes. Lord Lawson, former Chancellor of the Exchequer and a Tory peer, voted 14 times, a rate of 7.5 per cent.

Meanwhile friends of Lloyd-Webber said he was given his title for service to the arts and was 'obviously not a working peer', adding that he had opened a West End show and a Broadway show in the past year. Lord Owen, former leader of the Social Democratic Party, voted only once. For the Labour peer and film director Lord Attenborough the figure was 15 votes or 8 per cent, while for Lord Hattersley it was 16 votes.

      "body": "<p>Neil Hamilton, the disgraced Conservative Minister, will tomorrow launch a bid to overturn last year's High Court decision that he was not libelled when Mohamed al-Fayed, the owner of Harrods, accused him of taking payments in cash, gift vouchers and holidays at the Paris Ritz in return for asking questions in parliament.</p> <p>The Hamiltons' lawyers are expected to say that Fayed improperly obtained defence documents which helped him - though not his legal team - to win the court battle. The tycoon is accused of paying Benjy 'The Binman' Pell, a freelance tipster who is reported to make his living rifling the rubbish of the rich and famous for saleable documents, a total of \u00a310,000 for notes thrown away by Hamilton's lawyers. Fayed has always denied the claim which, if true, could lead the Appeal Court to overturn the original verdict.</p> <p>But The Observer has learned that a City of London police investigation into the allegation, launched nine months ago following a complaint by Hamilton's solici tors, has been dropped. Last week, the officer leading the inquiry wrote to Fayed's lawyers telling them that 'on the basis of the evidence available at this date' the Egyptian tycoon was not to be interviewed and that, following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, he had decided not to charge anyone. The timing could not be worse for the Hamiltons.</p> <p>At the weekend, no one seemed certain whether the case would go ahead. Max Clifford, the publicist who is spokesman for Fayed, said he could no longer see 'any point' in Hamilton's appeal. The Hamiltons' lawyers were not available for comment.</p> <p>The stakes are high and interest is fierce. Last year, after a five-week case dubbed 'Liar vs Liar' by the press, a jury decided that the allegations made by Fayed were fair and that he had not libelled the former MP. The court ordered Hamilton, 51, to pay both sides' million pound- plus legal costs.</p> <p>Hamilton, who lost his Tatton seat in the 1997 election to the broadcaster Martin Bell, was ruined. Since then he has busied himself giving legal advice to former constituents. His wife, Christine, recently confessed to turning to alcohol and pills. Appearances on talk shows and two books have kept the couple afloat but they are ostracised from Conservative Party circles.</p> <p>Though a victory next week is unlikely to mean a political, or a social, comeback it would offer an escape from the massive legal bill. Currently the Hamiltons' Cheshire manor house is mortgaged to the lawyers. The couple, who once enjoyed four overseas holidays a year, have been reduced to bucket-shop trips to Spain where they stay at friends' villas. They say the rain streams through the roof of their London flat because they do not have the money for repairs.</p> <p>Yet there are backers who are willing to provide funds for continuing legal action. The Hamiltons have hired a legal team headed by one of Britain's leading libel QCs. The former politician has admitted drawing on the financial support of 'a blind trust' of the wealthy and influential, reportedly including Gyles Brandreth, the former Conservative MP, Taki, the Greek-born society columnist, and Norris McWhirter, the founder of the Guinness Book of Records.</p> <p>Supporters of Fayed are outraged by the flow of funds to Hamilton. 'There are many people out there who are enemies of Mohamed [al-Fayed] who want to attack from a distance but remain in hiding. Someone is putting a lot of money into this.

      "bodyText": "Neil Hamilton, the disgraced Conservative Minister, will tomorrow launch a bid to overturn last year's High Court decision that he was not libelled when Mohamed al-Fayed, the owner of Harrods, accused him of taking payments in cash, gift vouchers and holidays at the Paris Ritz in return for asking questions in parliament. The Hamiltons' lawyers are expected to say that Fayed improperly obtained defence documents which helped him - though not his legal team - to win the court battle. The tycoon is accused of paying Benjy 'The Binman' Pell, a freelance tipster who is reported to make his living rifling the rubbish of the rich and famous for saleable documents, a total of \u00a310,000 for notes thrown away by Hamilton's lawyers. Fayed has always denied the claim which, if true, could lead the Appeal Court to overturn the original verdict. But The Observer has learned that a City of London police investigation into the allegation, launched nine months ago following a complaint by Hamilton's solici tors, has been dropped. Last week, the officer leading the inquiry wrote to Fayed's lawyers telling them that 'on the basis of the evidence available at this date' the Egyptian tycoon was not to be interviewed and that, following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, he had decided not to charge anyone. The timing could not be worse for the Hamiltons. At the weekend, no one seemed certain whether the case would go ahead. Max Clifford, the publicist who is spokesman for Fayed, said he could no longer see 'any point' in Hamilton's appeal. The Hamiltons' lawyers were not available for comment. The stakes are high and interest is fierce. Last year, after a five-week case dubbed 'Liar vs Liar' by the press, a jury decided that the allegations made by Fayed were fair and that he had not libelled the former MP. The court ordered Hamilton, 51, to pay both sides' million pound- plus legal costs. Hamilton, who lost his Tatton seat in the 1997 election to the broadcaster Martin Bell, was ruined. Since then he has busied himself giving legal advice to former constituents. His wife, Christine, recently confessed to turning to alcohol and pills. Appearances on talk shows and two books have kept the couple afloat but they are ostracised from Conservative Party circles. Though a victory next week is unlikely to mean a political, or a social, comeback it would offer an escape from the massive legal bill. Currently the Hamiltons' Cheshire manor house is mortgaged to the lawyers. The couple, who once enjoyed four overseas holidays a year, have been reduced to bucket-shop trips to Spain where they stay at friends' villas. They say the rain streams through the roof of their London flat because they do not have the money for repairs. Yet there are backers who are willing to provide funds for continuing legal action. The Hamiltons have hired a legal team headed by one of Britain's leading libel QCs. The former politician has admitted drawing on the financial support of 'a blind trust' of the wealthy and influential, reportedly including Gyles Brandreth, the former Conservative MP, Taki, the Greek-born society columnist, and Norris McWhirter, the founder of the Guinness Book of Records. Supporters of Fayed are outraged by the flow of funds to Hamilton. 'There are many people out there who are enemies of Mohamed [al-Fayed] who want to attack from a distance but remain in hiding. Someone is putting a lot of money into this. I do not think it is at all healthy,' said Clifford yesterday. Last November the country was transfixed as 'the phoney Pharoah' and 'the biggest crook in town' - as they were described by lawyers - battled it out in the law court. George Carman QC, for Fayed, put in a bravura performance as he explained how Hamilton took \u00a330,000 in cash and gifts from Fayed between 1985 and 1989 in return for a variety of services including putting down parliamentary questions. Describing the high cost of the Ritz, owned by Fayed, at the time of the Hamiltons' all-expenses paid visit in 1987, he said: 'It would have cost a dog \u00a347 to spend the night and that's before the wretched animal had anything to eat.' Fayed himself provided equal entertainment. When asked why he had added the prefix 'al' to his name - denoting nobility in Arabic - the tycoon merely answered: 'You can call me Al Capone if you want.' jason.burke@observer.co.uk",

What the so-called 'experts' on eating disorders who have condemned her seem to have chosen to ignore is, firstly, that children whose mothers make them aware of the relationship between what they eat and drink and their physical appearance don't automatically become paranoid about food, and, secondly, that the incidence of obesity in children is far higher than anorexia or bulimia.</p> <p>It is a sad fact that increasing numbers of children are eating too much, aided and abetted by the ready availability of chocolates, crisps and fast food.

A Raleigh staff member said the Prince was 'a very comfortable person, a genuine person, very open and honest'. The Prince said: 'I'm with a group of people I wouldn't normally be with. There are some real characters who don't hold back any words at all.' He is sleeping in a former nursery classroom with 15 others - 'The living conditions here aren't exactly what I'm used to' - who share two toilets and a makeshift shower. During his visit William has been nicknamed 'el principe' by locals and 'Little Princess' by his British contemporaries, 27 of whom are on Raleigh's 'at risk' programme, which takes socially excluded young people. The Prince will spend Christmas at Sandringham. He starts studying the history of art at St Andrews University next September.",

'I received your postcard in the hospital at Arles,' he begins, 'where I have been quartered following an attack of something the matter with my brains, or otherwise fever, which had nearly passed off already.'</p> <p>Three years earlier, at the age of 33, Van Gogh had travelled to Paris and became a particularly close friend of Paul Gauguin. But on Christmas Eve 1888, they argued badly and Van Gogh lunged at Gauguin before mutilating himself by cutting a large slice from his ear. He wrapped the severed piece in paper and gave it to a prostitute.

'And as for the causes and consequences of said illness,' he writes, 'I think I shall be wise to leave the solving of these problems to the fortuitous discussions of the Dutch catechists, that is to say whether I am mad or not, or whether I have been mad, and am still mad, in some imagination of a purely sculptural nature.'</p> <p>The date of the letter, which is expected to reach more than \u00a3100,000 at auction at Sotheby's in New York on Wednesday and which belongs to a descendant of Koning, marks the beginning of the end of a productive period for the artist. Al-though he sold only one painting for 400 francs in his lifetime, he painted more than 200 canvases in the 15 months from February 1888.</p> <p>The letter goes on to describe the portrait the artist had on his easel at the time. Comparing his output to that of a Dutch philosopher of the day, Frederik Van Eeden, he wonders whether he is artistically capable of singing 'a lullaby in colours' and decides to leave that 'to the critics'.</p> <p>'But we talked all this over sufficiently at the time, didn't we?' he goes on. 'I mean the eternal problem of colours, which leads us on as far as our tranquillity of mind will allow.' Van Gogh then mentions the famous picture he had just painted of his doctor, F\u00e9lix Rey, now in the Pushkin Museum, Moscow. 'At any rate,' he writes, 'on leaving the hospital, I made a portrait of my own doctor. And I haven't wholly lost my equilibrium as a painter.'</p> <p>The clarity of thought in the letter supports the theory that Van Gogh's bout of illness had been brought on by poor diet and alcohol. The symptoms of acute intermittent porphyria - skin rashes, sensitivity to light, indigestion and mental disturbances - are brought on by both.</p> <p>In the past, art historians have pointed to Van Gogh's periods of intense activity as evidence of manic depression.</p> <p>Despite an improvement after his stay in the hospital, he declined again. In the last 70 days of his life, Van Gogh painted 70 canvases. On 29 July 1890, he died at 37 from a self-inflicted bullet wound.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:vanessa.thorpe@observer.co.uk\">vanessa.thorpe@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

'But we talked all this over sufficiently at the time, didn't we?' he goes on. 'I mean the eternal problem of colours, which leads us on as far as our tranquillity of mind will allow.' Van Gogh then mentions the famous picture he had just painted of his doctor, F\u00e9lix Rey, now in the Pushkin Museum, Moscow. 'At any rate,' he writes, 'on leaving the hospital, I made a portrait of my own doctor. And I haven't wholly lost my equilibrium as a painter.' The clarity of thought in the letter supports the theory that Van Gogh's bout of illness had been brought on by poor diet and alcohol. The symptoms of acute intermittent porphyria - skin rashes, sensitivity to light, indigestion and mental disturbances - are brought on by both. In the past, art historians have pointed to Van Gogh's periods of intense activity as evidence of manic depression. Despite an improvement after his stay in the hospital, he declined again. In the last 70 days of his life, Van Gogh painted 70 canvases. On 29 July 1890, he died at 37 from a self-inflicted bullet wound. vanessa.thorpe@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Call it the elephant test. If it looks like an elephant and sounds like an elephant then - the test goes - it is an elephant you're dealing with. Last week the elephant test, originally outlined by William Hague, was being applied to the emerging shape of the European Union.</p> <p>If it has a flag - the Eurosceptics say - and its own anthem, standard passports and a single currency; if it has a president and laws; if it is going to have a constitution and an army, then that's a European superstate you're dealing with.</p> <p>What that means has been spelt out in apocalyptic terms by the same Eurosceptics who have been using the elephant test to divine the future structure of the EU. Writing in the Mail on Sunday , John Laughland has warned that such a superstate would be worse than Stalin's Soviet Union.</p> <p>In a European superstate, the Eurosceptics say, British soldiers will be forced to march to 'President' Romano Prodi's tune. The blue and gold of Europe's flag will flutter above our public buildings - No 10 included. Centuries of British culture, our common law and political traditions would be consigned to history. Then, as Tory MP John Redwood predicts, the United Kingdom will have perished as an independent nation.</p> <p>This weekend as Europe's leaders met in Nice for the most fractious EU summit in a decade, no one underestimated its scope and importance. Officials in Nice have drawn comparisons with the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, insisting that the treaty which emerges will define the shape of Europe for the next 100 years. But the unanswered question remains: Exactly what kind of a beastie will the new Europe be? The answer, according to academics, constitutional experts, diplomats and European officials interviewed by The Observer, is that it will fall far short of a superstate, though they are divided about what form the EU will eventually take.</p> <p>The question will not be answered in Nice alone. Behind the momentum for greater European integration, there exists a separate momentum that is making Europe more homogeneous by the day. Nor is the changing culture exclusively European.</p> <p>From Trieste to Tralee, a generation of Europeans has grown up watching the same Hollywood films and television shows, reading the same books, wearing clothes from Gap and drinking Starbucks' coffee. Despite the tentative emergence of a European identity, that identity is defined by the globalisation of culture as a shared sense of a European values. And, for all the warnings of the Eurosceptics, one feature of this new European identity is undeniable: in spite of all the efforts of the French, the lingua franca of the businessmen, officials, and academics of the emerging European generation is English.</p> <p>One powerful image of a new Europe that is developing outside the political debate is provided by the Eurostar service from Brussels to London. Last Friday evening David, an 18-year-old student was leaning up against the newsagent's wall opposite the Eurostar terminal in the Belgian capital. 'I feel more European than Belgian,' he said 'but that's probably because I'm of Italian origin. Europe is a strong state and it's going to get stronger.'</p> <p>On the train itself Maxim, Stephanie and Melanie were travelling home to France from university in Brussels. 'We all feel European,' Stephanie said, 'but we can still keep our national identity.'</p> <p>'There are two real tests,' Dr Julia Smith, director of the European programme at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, says, calling from Zagreb, where she has been explaining the intricacies of the Nice summit to an audience of Croatians - whose country aspires to membership of the expanded EU.</p> <p>'Is there going to be a single European defence force - a real European army - and a single tax regime throughout Europe? Those are the two things that are stopping us from becoming a European superstate. The reality is that they are never going to happen.</p> <p>'The French position on the European rapid reaction force, all the posturing, is purely for domestic consumption. The real problem, I'm afraid, is the British media. Take the claims that Germany and Italy are planning a new inter-governmental conference after Nice to draw up a constitution to create a European superstate. What absolute nonsense!'</p> <p>Her view is shared by other prominent British academics and historians, including Eric Hobsbawm, Norman Davies, Corelli Barnett and Larry Siedentop.</p> <p>'The fact is,' says Hobsbawm, 'that the idea of the nation state which is sovereign, independent and that no one interferes with - the nineteenth-century idea - no longer corresponds to the reality of the world today. There is one such state - the United States - and perhaps Japan and China also qualify. But in the rest of the world we are subject to the influence of the international markets, global corporations, bodies like the World Trade Organisation set up by treaty or convention that affect all our lives.</p> <p>'We live in a world where more and more states are banding together - whether in Europe, the Americas or Asia - to make policies that benefit the member states. That does not mean new superstates are being created, rather that we are living in a world where layers of governance overlap in many different ways.</p> <p>'The real problem Europe is facing is not one of the creation of a superstate, but of the balance of power of states within such an organic grouping that may eventually represent 27 states. Those problems will be enormous.'</p> <p>Historian Norman Davies too is dubious about the use of terms such as superstate to describe the future enlargement and political development of Europe. 'The debate is presented in terms of two extreme positions, neither of which is going to apply to a Europe of the future. The first describes an amorphous, glorified Common Market of the kind we started out with, foreseeing no further radical changes to the structure despite the challenges of enlargement. That can't go on.</p> <p>'The second describes a classic superstate which would have a head of state, an executive in permanent session, a legislative assembly to whom it is answerable and its own individual judiciary. There is no sign of that happening or any likelihood of it in the future. The truth is that what we are seeing is the development of a new kind of polity of the kind that has never been seen before.'</p> <p>Davies believes drawing up a European constitution of the kind envisaged by Germany and Italy for a new inter-governmental conference four years after Nice, as well as a charter of rights, would not qualify the EU for statehood, let alone super-statehood.</p> <p>'You cannot have a social club or economic organisation - or even a football club - without an executive that organises it on the basis of an understood set of rules. At the moment that executive - contrary to what the Eurosceptics would have you believe - is the Council of Ministers, not the European Commission under Romano Prodi... And those Ministers represent their national interests, not the interests of a superstate.'</p> <p>Larry Siedentop, an Oxford politics don and author of the recently published Democracy in Europe , believes that a 'federal superstate' in the European context is 'a complete misnomer'. 'Ultimately the present moves may lead to a kind of federation but a different kind of entity than we have seen elsewhere.</p> <p>'The important thing is not to confuse centralism - of the kind espoused by the French - with federalism.' It might, he says, look 'something like a state', although of the loosest possible kind. Indeed, experts in European law believe that far from seeing more power transferred from sovereign states to a 'European state', any effort to draw up a constitution post-Nice, drawing on powers already invested in the existing European treaties such as Maastricht would - in reality - define the practical limits of centralised European powers.</p> <p>'In the current circumstances,' says Christophe Hellion, deputy director of the Centre for European Legal Studies at Cambridge University, an expert in the law of EU integration, 'member states are not very keen to extend to full functional government the powers of the EU. Rather, they want to take control of the way in which decisions are being taken. That is what Nice is about.</p> <p>'Rather than expanding the power of the Commission or the EU they want to limit it... Indeed what we are seeing at Nice is not the building of a superstate but the opposite in the way in which individual states are fighting to retain their national identities within Europe.'</p> <p>It is a trend reflected in the development of a European jurisprudence which, the Eurosceptics warn, would subsume British common law. It is a view not shared by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham, who, in a landmark ruling on a European human rights case last week, said the justice system in the EU allowed flexibility to reflect national priorities.</p> <p>Hellion, meanwhile, denies that moves to formulate a constitution post-Nice would lay a framework for European statehood, insisting instead it would serve simply to fulfill the demands of those - like Czech President Vaclav Havel - who asked for a coherent setting out of legal obligations that could be understood by 'every child in every European school', and not simply by government treaty lawyers.</p> <p>'Europe works like this,' says a senior German diplomat. 'When I am at home I support my local German football club. When Germany plays as a national side, I support the German team. But when Europe is playing against America in the Ryder Cup, then I support the Europeans.</p> <p>'The problem is that Britain is a society totally geared to winning or losing, and that is how they approach EU summits - like a football game. That is wrong. What is not being understood in Britain is that within Europe we want everyone to win. That is what is driving all this.</p> <p>'People seem to connect the idea of a constitution with a superstate. Look, the policy-making power of anything in the world that you might want to call a superstate is defined by the size of its budget. The budget of the EU is limited by treaty to 1.27 per cent of the member states' GDP, of which it uses less than one per cent. No large state uses less than 30 per cent.</p> <p>'Europe is not a federal state as we understand it. Nor is it a federation of states. It is something entirely new, something we have never seen before.'</p> <p>Not surprisingly the view that the new Europe will not threaten the integrity of its member nations is enthusiastically endorsed by Romano Prodi, the former Italian Prime Minister who is President of the European Commission. 'It is the only way in which our nation states can express themselves in a globalised world. There is no other way,' he said last week. A former professor of economics, Prodi has more of the air of a genial academic than of the scheming, power- hungry centralist at the head of a budding superstate, as demonised by the Eurosceptics.</p> <p>Sitting below a large seventeenth-century painting of a cherub in his office in Brussels, Prodi compares Europe's future without a union to the fate of Renaissance Italy whose city-states dominated science, the economy, military science, the fine arts, and technology, yet failed to become a world power because they failed to unite politically.</p> <p>'At the end of the story, this is irresistible. Otherwise we disappear from the world map. Even Germany has no hope of having a decisive say in the world. Think of China. When you go to Shanghai you see the scale of the world. Can you conceive then that the voice of a single European country on its own can be heard? I don't think so.'</p> <p>Prodi's critics, who include a number of European leaders, complain he is the weak leader of a disappointing team and that he has failed to restore the Commission's tainted image . He has set himself the task of bringing Europe closer to its citizens and halting a trend among European governments to strike deals among themselves, by-passing the Commission.</p> <p>Prodi claims to have made some progress, but he knows very well that he is not the most powerful man in the EU. 'I am not the king of Europe,' he says.</p> <p>In Italy, Prodi shepherded a group of left-wing forces towards the political centre and became, with Tony Blair and President Bill Clinton, a standard bearer of the Third Way. He remains more economically liberal than most EU leaders and sympathises with Blair's ambition to keep taxation out of Brussels' hands.</p> <p>'My motto the day I arrived was very simple - if a country wants to have lower taxation and expensive hospitals, or higher taxation and free hospitals, why not? Or free school, why not? I am not bothered.'</p> <p>\u0095 Denis Staunton writes for the 'Irish Times'</p> <p><br><b>All-powerful Brussels?

      "bodyText": "Call it the elephant test. If it looks like an elephant and sounds like an elephant then - the test goes - it is an elephant you're dealing with. Last week the elephant test, originally outlined by William Hague, was being applied to the emerging shape of the European Union. If it has a flag - the Eurosceptics say - and its own anthem, standard passports and a single currency; if it has a president and laws; if it is going to have a constitution and an army, then that's a European superstate you're dealing with. What that means has been spelt out in apocalyptic terms by the same Eurosceptics who have been using the elephant test to divine the future structure of the EU. Writing in the Mail on Sunday , John Laughland has warned that such a superstate would be worse than Stalin's Soviet Union. In a European superstate, the Eurosceptics say, British soldiers will be forced to march to 'President' Romano Prodi's tune. The blue and gold of Europe's flag will flutter above our public buildings - No 10 included. Centuries of British culture, our common law and political traditions would be consigned to history. Then, as Tory MP John Redwood predicts, the United Kingdom will have perished as an independent nation. This weekend as Europe's leaders met in Nice for the most fractious EU summit in a decade, no one underestimated its scope and importance. Officials in Nice have drawn comparisons with the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, insisting that the treaty which emerges will define the shape of Europe for the next 100 years. But the unanswered question remains: Exactly what kind of a beastie will the new Europe be? The answer, according to academics, constitutional experts, diplomats and European officials interviewed by The Observer, is that it will fall far short of a superstate, though they are divided about what form the EU will eventually take. The question will not be answered in Nice alone. Behind the momentum for greater European integration, there exists a separate momentum that is making Europe more homogeneous by the day. Nor is the changing culture exclusively European. From Trieste to Tralee, a generation of Europeans has grown up watching the same Hollywood films and television shows, reading the same books, wearing clothes from Gap and drinking Starbucks' coffee. Despite the tentative emergence of a European identity, that identity is defined by the globalisation of culture as a shared sense of a European values. And, for all the warnings of the Eurosceptics, one feature of this new European identity is undeniable: in spite of all the efforts of the French, the lingua franca of the businessmen, officials, and academics of the emerging European generation is English. One powerful image of a new Europe that is developing outside the political debate is provided by the Eurostar service from Brussels to London. Last Friday evening David, an 18-year-old student was leaning up against the newsagent's wall opposite the Eurostar terminal in the Belgian capital. 'I feel more European than Belgian,' he said 'but that's probably because I'm of Italian origin. Europe is a strong state and it's going to get stronger.' On the train itself Maxim, Stephanie and Melanie were travelling home to France from university in Brussels. 'We all feel European,' Stephanie said, 'but we can still keep our national identity.' 'There are two real tests,' Dr Julia Smith, director of the European programme at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, says, calling from Zagreb, where she has been explaining the intricacies of the Nice summit to an audience of Croatians - whose country aspires to membership of the expanded EU. 'Is there going to be a single European defence force - a real European army - and a single tax regime throughout Europe? Those are the two things that are stopping us from becoming a European superstate. The reality is that they are never going to happen. 'The French position on the European rapid reaction force, all the posturing, is purely for domestic consumption. The real problem, I'm afraid, is the British media. Take the claims that Germany and Italy are planning a new inter-governmental conference after Nice to draw up a constitution to create a European superstate. What absolute nonsense!' Her view is shared by other prominent British academics and historians, including Eric Hobsbawm, Norman Davies, Corelli Barnett and Larry Siedentop. 'The fact is,' says Hobsbawm, 'that the idea of the nation state which is sovereign, independent and that no one interferes with - the nineteenth-century idea - no longer corresponds to the reality of the world today. There is one such state - the United States - and perhaps Japan and China also qualify. But in the rest of the world we are subject to the influence of the international markets, global corporations, bodies like the World Trade Organisation set up by treaty or convention that affect all our lives. 'We live in a world where more and more states are banding together - whether in Europe, the Americas or Asia - to make policies that benefit the member states. That does not mean new superstates are being created, rather that we are living in a world where layers of governance overlap in many different ways. 'The real problem Europe is facing is not one of the creation of a superstate, but of the balance of power of states within such an organic grouping that may eventually represent 27 states. Those problems will be enormous.' Historian Norman Davies too is dubious about the use of terms such as superstate to describe the future enlargement and political development of Europe. 'The debate is presented in terms of two extreme positions, neither of which is going to apply to a Europe of the future. The first describes an amorphous, glorified Common Market of the kind we started out with, foreseeing no further radical changes to the structure despite the challenges of enlargement. That can't go on. 'The second describes a classic superstate which would have a head of state, an executive in permanent session, a legislative assembly to whom it is answerable and its own individual judiciary. There is no sign of that happening or any likelihood of it in the future. The truth is that what we are seeing is the development of a new kind of polity of the kind that has never been seen before.' Davies believes drawing up a European constitution of the kind envisaged by Germany and Italy for a new inter-governmental conference four years after Nice, as well as a charter of rights, would not qualify the EU for statehood, let alone super-statehood. 'You cannot have a social club or economic organisation - or even a football club - without an executive that organises it on the basis of an understood set of rules. At the moment that executive - contrary to what the Eurosceptics would have you believe - is the Council of Ministers, not the European Commission under Romano Prodi... And those Ministers represent their national interests, not the interests of a superstate.' Larry Siedentop, an Oxford politics don and author of the recently published Democracy in Europe , believes that a 'federal superstate' in the European context is 'a complete misnomer'. 'Ultimately the present moves may lead to a kind of federation but a different kind of entity than we have seen elsewhere. 'The important thing is not to confuse centralism - of the kind espoused by the French - with federalism.' It might, he says, look 'something like a state', although of the loosest possible kind. Indeed, experts in European law believe that far from seeing more power transferred from sovereign states to a 'European state', any effort to draw up a constitution post-Nice, drawing on powers already invested in the existing European treaties such as Maastricht would - in reality - define the practical limits of centralised European powers.

      "body": "<p>Faced with a near trebling of passenger numbers over the next 20 years, the Government will this week announce proposals for a building programme to vastly expand the capacity of Britain's airports and a relaxation of rules on night flights.</p> <p>A consultation document on the future of aviation is set to ignite battles with environmental groups, residents and local authorities as fierce as those over Heathrow's Terminal Five and the second runway at Manchester.</p> <p>The plans - to be outlined by Transport Minister Lord Macdonald on Tuesday - include a huge expansion of regional airports. A second priority will be to build new runways and terminals for airports around London.</p> <p>Sixty local authorities will launch a pre-emptive strike tomorrow with the publication of a study highlighting the environmental and economic costs of allowing unrestricted growth in the number of flights. The Strategic Aviation Special Interest Group of the Local Government Association will be urging the Government to look at alternative ways of developing the economy.</p> <p>The Government will set out ways to meet the growing demand for air travel up to 2030.

      "bodyText": "Faced with a near trebling of passenger numbers over the next 20 years, the Government will this week announce proposals for a building programme to vastly expand the capacity of Britain's airports and a relaxation of rules on night flights. A consultation document on the future of aviation is set to ignite battles with environmental groups, residents and local authorities as fierce as those over Heathrow's Terminal Five and the second runway at Manchester. The plans - to be outlined by Transport Minister Lord Macdonald on Tuesday - include a huge expansion of regional airports. A second priority will be to build new runways and terminals for airports around London. Sixty local authorities will launch a pre-emptive strike tomorrow with the publication of a study highlighting the environmental and economic costs of allowing unrestricted growth in the number of flights. The Strategic Aviation Special Interest Group of the Local Government Association will be urging the Government to look at alternative ways of developing the economy. The Government will set out ways to meet the growing demand for air travel up to 2030. The Department of the Environment Transport and the Regions recently forecast that the number of passengers would grow from 160 million to as many as 461m over the next 20 years. The document is set to infuriate environmentalists by suggesting there is not much that can be done to slow the growth in air traffic. The Government wants to introduce a tax on aviation fuel, but thinks that it would only have a marginal impact on traffic numbers, and can only been done in co-operation with all other world powers, including the US.

From next spring air traffic control chiefs plan to halve the minimum space separating jets to 1,000ft at the higher levels. The news comes as senior industry experts are expressing fears that a mid-air crash over Europe is 'imminent'. Controllers in Scotland, who deal with more than a thousand planes a day flying across the north Atlantic at these higher levels, told The Observer that such narrow separation had been known to produce violent turbulence, causing jumbo jets to roll without warning. They warned that introducing similar moves with only minimal training into the teeming skies over Europe, where most aircraft are climbing or descending and military traffic regularly causes safety alerts, would reduce the margin for error and 'could be very scary'. A spokesman for the UK controllers' union IPMS said: 'Our chief concern is that controllers are only going to get one day's training now prior to the new system going live in April.' The row adds to an increasingly chaotic picture of air traffic control across Europe, where the new separation limits will be introduced in 2002, with widespread safety failings and overworked, understaffed services mirroring the problems at the heart of the creaking London ATC system. Well-placed sources at Eurocontrol told The Observer that soaring traffic over the Continent and serious under-resourcing in radar centres such as Maastricht in the Netherlands posed serious threats. 'Safety has been eroded to the point where the risk of a collision is imminent,' said a senior source. Other sources say there have been at least 50 safety-related incidents investigated at Maastricht this year, mostly of aircraft infringing legal separation limits, said by one source to be 'a near-miss by another name'. The number is rising dramatically every year, The Observer was told, although official figures have yet to be released. Other causes of concern at the Maastricht centre include: \u0095 Operating manuals more than five years out of date; \u0095 Controllers adapting to new procedures 'on the job' without simulator training; \u0095 'Vast differences' between controllers over acceptable risk when aircraft converge; \u0095 Lack of preparation for an expected 100 per cent rise in air traffic in the next decade. One controller said: 'We are in a business that is trying to juggle safety with stuffing as many aircraft into the sky as possible. The fundamental procedures are unsafe.'

Like the current deal, the aborted T-Online takeover would also have been an all-share offer. T-Online's shares have fallen from DM40 to DM16 over that period. </p> <p>Given that Dixons would surely have been prevented from selling its shares at least until now, its holding in the combined group would, therefore, be worth little over a third of what it was then. Not such a big difference from the takeover price. </p> <p>It is also worth remembering that Dixons has invested only around \u00a375,000 in Freeserve, raised close to \u00a3100 million from last year's flotation and that its stake in the business is currently worth more than \u00a31bn, on paper. </p> <p>Of course, Wanadoo's shares could well fall further before Dixons is allowed to offload its stake - it can sell a fifth within the first six months following the completion of the deal and the remainder within five years. But which analyst could say with certainty that Freeserve's shares do not have further to fall? </p> <p>Add in reports that consumers are already bored with the internet, the slump in advertising as dotcoms become deadcoms, the low level of e-commerce and the rise in unmetered access.

Its stake in the combined group will be just 12.7 per cent, compared with its 80 per cent holding in Freeserve, so it will be treated differently in Dixons' accounts. </p> <p>Unfortunately, however, the state of that underlying business is looking less healthy than it was. </p> <p>The evidence from the high street so far is that Christmas is being delayed, and the fear is it may be completely cancelled. </p> <p>Dixons is still signalling that there is no cause for concern, but the pessimists worry that it is simply playing for time while it waits to see whether sales recover some momentum. </p> <p>That nervousness is likely to continue until Dixons reports its results, and gives some indication of Christmas trading, on 1 January - so the shares will be volatile until then. </p> <p>In the longer term, the question is where it goes next. Will it be looking for more acquisitions on the continent, which could put it into competition with Kingfisher? And will its cost-cutting programme be enough to prevent a further erosion of margins? </p> <p>Those with the stomach for a bit of turbulence should buy for the long term. </p> <p><strong> Buoyant Bass keeps a cool head</strong><br> </p> <p> Sir Ian Prosser, chairman of Bass, must be wondering what on earth he has to do to please the City.

But it points to the excellent returns it is currently enjoying from refurbishing both its own estate and the 550 pubs acquired from Allied Domecq, now dubbed the development estate, and hints that it will wait until more of those benefits have flowed to profits before it does anything drastic. It should be careful not to leave it too late. </p> <p>On the face of it, its pubs chain is doing well. Sales rose almost a fifth and operating profit by a quarter in the year to September. But much of the sales growth came from the Allied pubs; excluding that, sales are down and those falls have continued into the start of the current year. </p> <p>Bass prefers to concentrate on the potential for improving the Allied estate. Certainly, the rises have been spectacular - a trebling in sales is not unusual. Only 15 per cent of the Allied pubs have been converted so far, so there is still plenty of scope for growth there. </p> <p>It is also reviewing the future of 1,000 or so underperforming pubs. The review will not be complete until January but if, as the City expects, they are sold, it will highlight the performance of the rest of the estate. </p> <p>The question is, how long will they continue performing? Food and drink retailing through large chains seems to be a constant race to stay ahead of a fickle public: as soon as a successful format is rolled out, the public gets fed up with it. </p> <p>Bass's hotel chain is enjoying buoyant trading, with sales up by 36 per cent and profits by 24 per cent. The \u00a33 billion war chest it has following the disposal of its brewing operations is most likely to be invested here. </p> <p>Bass' record on acquisitions is patchy - it has been unable to roll out the Inter-Continental chain fast enough to justify the high price it paid - so it must buy wisely this time. </p> <p>The fact that it is taking the power to buy back more shares suggests it is not in a rush to spend its cash, which is encouraging. But the rise in the shares last week makes them look fully valued. </p> <p>Until it decides what to buy, the shares are a hold at best.</p>",

Bass prefers to concentrate on the potential for improving the Allied estate. Certainly, the rises have been spectacular - a trebling in sales is not unusual. Only 15 per cent of the Allied pubs have been converted so far, so there is still plenty of scope for growth there. It is also reviewing the future of 1,000 or so underperforming pubs. The review will not be complete until January but if, as the City expects, they are sold, it will highlight the performance of the rest of the estate. The question is, how long will they continue performing? Food and drink retailing through large chains seems to be a constant race to stay ahead of a fickle public: as soon as a successful format is rolled out, the public gets fed up with it. Bass's hotel chain is enjoying buoyant trading, with sales up by 36 per cent and profits by 24 per cent. The \u00a33 billion war chest it has following the disposal of its brewing operations is most likely to be invested here. Bass' record on acquisitions is patchy - it has been unable to roll out the Inter-Continental chain fast enough to justify the high price it paid - so it must buy wisely this time. The fact that it is taking the power to buy back more shares suggests it is not in a rush to spend its cash, which is encouraging. But the rise in the shares last week makes them look fully valued. Until it decides what to buy, the shares are a hold at best.",

But there is a delicious irony in the story, for Xerox ought to have been the most valuable company the world has ever seen - as big as Microsoft, Intel, IBM, 3COM and Hewlett-Packard combined. Why? Because there was a time, in the early Seventies, when Xerox owned almost every key ingredient of personal computer technology, but spectacularly failed to recognise the fact. When company executives eventually realised what magic their research scientists had unleashed, they were too late and too clumsy in bringing the technology to market. Someone later wrote a book about this. Its title - Fumbling the Future - said it all. </p> <p>The Xerox story is one of the defining legends of the computer business. In 1969, in a rare fit of inspiration, the company decided to set up a high-powered research lab in California in order to find out what the 'paperless office' hype was all about. The Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) turned out to be an inspired bet. The director of its Computer Science Lab was Bob Taylor, the guy who had commissioned and funded the Arpanet. Taylor recruited a cohort of formidable computer scientists and gave them unlimited research funds and an open brief. In four years they repaid his trust by inventing most of the computing technology we use today - high-resolution, bit-mapped screens, windowing interfaces, template-based word-processing, the laser printer and ethernet local area networking. </p> <p>The first laser printer was invented by Gary Starkweather and was working in November 1971. In April 1974 Chuck Thacker switched on the Alto, the first computer that looked and worked like a modern PC or Macintosh. (Its first task was to display an animated image of Sesame Street's Cookie Monster.) The following month, Bob Metcalfe wrote a patent application for ethernet networking. By August, software for displaying overlapping, resizable windows and pop-up menus was working. By October 1974 Charles Simonyi and others had finished 'Bravo' - the world's first user-friendly, general-purpose word processing program (and the precursor of Microsoft Word). </p> <p>Xerox executives were bemused by all this stuff. They couldn't figure out a business model for exploiting the technology. Eventually they marketed it as a clunky, expensive, large-scale, integrated 'office system'. But in the meantime, the techies had demonstrated their stuff to Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. </p> <p>Jobs famously asked them if they had any plans to exploit it. They shrugged - that was up to the suits. So Jobs decided that he would bring the technology to the mass market if Xerox wouldn't. The Apple Macintosh - and, later, Microsoft Windows - were the results of this heist. Afterwards, Jobs quoted Picasso's celebrated aphorism: 'Minor artists borrow; great artists steal.' </p> <p>All of which is no consolation to Xerox's current bosses as they wriggle to save the company. Last week, in a poignant gesture, they spun off a small company, Gyricon Media, to exploit technology recently developed by PARC - a flexible, paper-thin material that can be used to display computer-generated text. </p> <p>The first applications will be in creating changeable signs for retail stores. For example, during the day, when housewives are shopping, displays might feature families using a product. When office workers start filing in at night, the store manager could hit a button and change the display to show men in suits. Or Xerox executives, looking lost. </p> <p><br> <a href=\"mailto:john.naughton@observer.co.uk\">john.naughton@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

In four years they repaid his trust by inventing most of the computing technology we use today - high-resolution, bit-mapped screens, windowing interfaces, template-based word-processing, the laser printer and ethernet local area networking. The first laser printer was invented by Gary Starkweather and was working in November 1971. In April 1974 Chuck Thacker switched on the Alto, the first computer that looked and worked like a modern PC or Macintosh. (Its first task was to display an animated image of Sesame Street's Cookie Monster.) The following month, Bob Metcalfe wrote a patent application for ethernet networking. By August, software for displaying overlapping, resizable windows and pop-up menus was working. By October 1974 Charles Simonyi and others had finished 'Bravo' - the world's first user-friendly, general-purpose word processing program (and the precursor of Microsoft Word). Xerox executives were bemused by all this stuff. They couldn't figure out a business model for exploiting the technology. Eventually they marketed it as a clunky, expensive, large-scale, integrated 'office system'. But in the meantime, the techies had demonstrated their stuff to Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Jobs famously asked them if they had any plans to exploit it. They shrugged - that was up to the suits. So Jobs decided that he would bring the technology to the mass market if Xerox wouldn't. The Apple Macintosh - and, later, Microsoft Windows - were the results of this heist. Afterwards, Jobs quoted Picasso's celebrated aphorism: 'Minor artists borrow; great artists steal.' All of which is no consolation to Xerox's current bosses as they wriggle to save the company. Last week, in a poignant gesture, they spun off a small company, Gyricon Media, to exploit technology recently developed by PARC - a flexible, paper-thin material that can be used to display computer-generated text. The first applications will be in creating changeable signs for retail stores. For example, during the day, when housewives are shopping, displays might feature families using a product. When office workers start filing in at night, the store manager could hit a button and change the display to show men in suits. Or Xerox executives, looking lost. john.naughton@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>A quarter of a million homes repossessed, a 7 per cent slump in house prices - and double that in London - as well as a 50 per cent drop in the number of sales... Who could forget the Nineties housing slump? </p> <p>No one, if the Government has its way. From debt summits and task forces to campaigns fronted by pop star Louise, the authorities are warning us of the perils of borrowing too much. Last week, it was the turn of Howard Davies, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, to have a go at those responsible for the bulk of our debts: the mortgage lenders. </p> <p>London house prices, Davies said, were remarkably close to the peaks reached before the last slump. So is it wise for mortgage lenders to be quite so generous? </p> <p>'It may be that the London premium will remain at this historically high level,' Davies told the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML). 'But clearly one cannot exclude the possibility of a fall in London house prices, which could put very high loan-to-value loans into the danger zone.' </p> <p>So is there a risk of a rerun of the boom-and-bust housing market which proved so painful a decade ago? Or is Davies taking regulatory prudence to the extreme? </p> <p>The doom-mongers could certainly find plenty of similarities between the current market and that of the Eighties boom. It may now be a bit less frothy than it was, but London dinner parties are still buzzing with tales of gazumping, of lottery-style profits made in just a few years, and of houses in desirable areas being snapped up almost beforegoing on sale. </p> <p>Figures from the CML show that the average loan is now 2.24 times the borrower's annual income, rising to 2.28 times for first-time buyers. That is higher than it was at the height of the Eighties boom when, even for first-time buyers, the average was less than 2.2 times income. </p> <p>It is once again relatively easy to borrow 100 per cent of the value of the property - something few lenders would offer during the post-slump Nineties. Indeed, you can get even more than that: Northern Rock's Together mortgage offers borrowers up to 125 per cent of the price of their house. </p> <p>And prices have been rising. The average house now costs over \u00a3102,000, a 20 per cent rise in two years; in London, the rise has been an even more dramatic 33 per cent. But what most worries Davies is that house prices in London are now almost 60 per cent above the national average, higher than at the top of the Eighties boom. </p> <p>'The last peak in this ratio was followed by five to six years in which London prices underperformed the rest of the market by around 30 per cent,' Davies points out. </p> <p>Yet no one, not even Davies, is predicting a slump of that proportion this time. Indeed, most forecasters expect the housing market to show steady, if unspectacular, growth. The CML, for example, thinks prices will rise by 6 per cent next year and 5 per cent in 2002, with the number of transactions staying close to the average of around 1.5 million a year. </p> <p>The key reason for the confidence this time round is interest rates. The Eighties boom was killed by a dramatic hike in rates. They rose from 9.5 to 15 per cent in little over a year, pushed up largely to kill the consumer boom which soaring house prices had caused. It's different this time. Davies says: 'The level of interest rates is considerably lower now than it was then, and with monetary policy now in the safe hands of the Bank of England, there is good reason to hope that we shall not see the kind of high interest rate peaks which characterised the Seventies, Eighties and early Nineties.' </p> <p>If he is right - and most economists agree with him - the high debt levels are far less worrying than they would have been. 'The critical point is that if interest rates are low, you can afford to borrow more,' said Rob Thomas, housing market analyst with UBS Warburg. </p> <p>This is reflected by the fact that despite the recent rise in house prices, borrowers are paying only around 25 per cent of their salaries in mortgage payments, compared with more than 36 per cent at the peak of the last boom. </p> <p>The problem is, mortgages are not the only debts we have, and our other borrowings have been rising fast. The Office of Fair Trading, which used Louise to launch its debt campaign last month, points out that the average person has \u00a32,500 in unsecured borrowing - personal loans, credit card debt and so on. Total unsecured borrowing has increased by 60 per cent over the past year to a total of more than \u00a3159 billion. Taking that into account, borrowers are far more stretched than they used to be. Of course, mortgage lenders insist that they take unsecured debts into account when deciding how much to lend for a house purchase. And all say they have learnt the lessons of the Eighties, claiming to be far more prudent about lending than they were then. </p> <p>The evidence suggests, however, that the only thing that has changed is the economic outlook. Loans as a multiple of income are higher than they ever were. Some new entrants to the market, such as Standard Life, do not even look at such things as income multiples in deciding whether to grant a mortgage; they concentrate on how much is left by people's existing outgoings to meet mortgage payments. </p> <p>And, following the furore over endowment policies, which were pushed with such enthusiasm by lenders in the Eighties boom, many lenders no longer concern themselves with the way in which a loan will be repaid. </p> <p>The most extreme example of this is the interest-only mortgage, designed for the well-heeled. Users of these do not have to take out any insurance or investment product to pay off the loan when it matures. Instead, the aim is to repay it with anticipated bonus payments, inheritances or perhaps a large future salary increase. It is, obviously, a high-risk product. Yet the most recent statistics show that 16 per cent of all new lending was made on an interest-only basis. </p> <p>One mortgage broker said: 'I would be interested to know how many of these people really understand the risks they are taking.' </p> <p>Northern Rock insists that its Together mortgage, which may be repaid in any way, is a prudent approach to lending, even though borrowers can end up with loans 25 per cent higher than the value of their homes. </p> <p>The former building society says most of these customers have credit card and personal loan debts, and if they switch these to their mortgage account, the interest rate is so much lower they can afford to borrow more. </p> <p>This is fine if house prices remain stable or go on rising. But if they fall, borrowers who have to sell could find it impossible to pay off their loans - just as so many people did in the Eighties. </p> <p><strong>How the boom went bust</strong></p> <p>The Nineties housing slump was much more than bad news for the banks and building societies, who were faced with a rising tide of bad debts and a stagnant market which lasted for much of the following decade. The boom-and-bust in the property market touched all corners of the economy, affecting almost everyone in the country. Indeed, much of the downturn in the early Nineties can be directly attributed to it. </p> <p>The key was confidence. As house prices soared, so did a general feeling of well-being. The more you think your house is worth, the more you will be willing to spend on other things, from foreign holidays to smart restaurants. The consumer economy boomed. </p> <p>When house prices started falling and interest rates began to rise, such feelings of wealth evaporated. People who are worried that they won't be able to pay their mortgage are not likely to spend their savings on other things. The consumer economy slumped. Unemployment rose, which exacerbated the problem. </p> <p>So is there such a risk to the economy this time round? The consensus is no. John Butler, UK economist at HSBC, points out that the economy is no longer being driven only by the strength of the housing market. Falling unemployment and the strength of equity markets are both big contributors to confidence. </p> <p>So even if the property market does turn down, it is unlikely to have the serious impact it had in the Eighties. But there will still, of course, be many casualties.</p>",

That is higher than it was at the height of the Eighties boom when, even for first-time buyers, the average was less than 2.2 times income. It is once again relatively easy to borrow 100 per cent of the value of the property - something few lenders would offer during the post-slump Nineties. Indeed, you can get even more than that: Northern Rock's Together mortgage offers borrowers up to 125 per cent of the price of their house. And prices have been rising. The average house now costs over \u00a3102,000, a 20 per cent rise in two years; in London, the rise has been an even more dramatic 33 per cent. But what most worries Davies is that house prices in London are now almost 60 per cent above the national average, higher than at the top of the Eighties boom. 'The last peak in this ratio was followed by five to six years in which London prices underperformed the rest of the market by around 30 per cent,' Davies points out. Yet no one, not even Davies, is predicting a slump of that proportion this time. Indeed, most forecasters expect the housing market to show steady, if unspectacular, growth. The CML, for example, thinks prices will rise by 6 per cent next year and 5 per cent in 2002, with the number of transactions staying close to the average of around 1.5 million a year. The key reason for the confidence this time round is interest rates. The Eighties boom was killed by a dramatic hike in rates. They rose from 9.5 to 15 per cent in little over a year, pushed up largely to kill the consumer boom which soaring house prices had caused. It's different this time. Davies says: 'The level of interest rates is considerably lower now than it was then, and with monetary policy now in the safe hands of the Bank of England, there is good reason to hope that we shall not see the kind of high interest rate peaks which characterised the Seventies, Eighties and early Nineties.' If he is right - and most economists agree with him - the high debt levels are far less worrying than they would have been. 'The critical point is that if interest rates are low, you can afford to borrow more,' said Rob Thomas, housing market analyst with UBS Warburg. This is reflected by the fact that despite the recent rise in house prices, borrowers are paying only around 25 per cent of their salaries in mortgage payments, compared with more than 36 per cent at the peak of the last boom. The problem is, mortgages are not the only debts we have, and our other borrowings have been rising fast. The Office of Fair Trading, which used Louise to launch its debt campaign last month, points out that the average person has \u00a32,500 in unsecured borrowing - personal loans, credit card debt and so on. Total unsecured borrowing has increased by 60 per cent over the past year to a total of more than \u00a3159 billion. Taking that into account, borrowers are far more stretched than they used to be. Of course, mortgage lenders insist that they take unsecured debts into account when deciding how much to lend for a house purchase. And all say they have learnt the lessons of the Eighties, claiming to be far more prudent about lending than they were then. The evidence suggests, however, that the only thing that has changed is the economic outlook. Loans as a multiple of income are higher than they ever were. Some new entrants to the market, such as Standard Life, do not even look at such things as income multiples in deciding whether to grant a mortgage; they concentrate on how much is left by people's existing outgoings to meet mortgage payments. And, following the furore over endowment policies, which were pushed with such enthusiasm by lenders in the Eighties boom, many lenders no longer concern themselves with the way in which a loan will be repaid. The most extreme example of this is the interest-only mortgage, designed for the well-heeled. Users of these do not have to take out any insurance or investment product to pay off the loan when it matures. Instead, the aim is to repay it with anticipated bonus payments, inheritances or perhaps a large future salary increase. It is, obviously, a high-risk product. Yet the most recent statistics show that 16 per cent of all new lending was made on an interest-only basis. One mortgage broker said: 'I would be interested to know how many of these people really understand the risks they are taking.' Northern Rock insists that its Together mortgage, which may be repaid in any way, is a prudent approach to lending, even though borrowers can end up with loans 25 per cent higher than the value of their homes. The former building society says most of these customers have credit card and personal loan debts, and if they switch these to their mortgage account, the interest rate is so much lower they can afford to borrow more. This is fine if house prices remain stable or go on rising. But if they fall, borrowers who have to sell could find it impossible to pay off their loans - just as so many people did in the Eighties. How the boom went bust The Nineties housing slump was much more than bad news for the banks and building societies, who were faced with a rising tide of bad debts and a stagnant market which lasted for much of the following decade. The boom-and-bust in the property market touched all corners of the economy, affecting almost everyone in the country. Indeed, much of the downturn in the early Nineties can be directly attributed to it. The key was confidence. As house prices soared, so did a general feeling of well-being. The more you think your house is worth, the more you will be willing to spend on other things, from foreign holidays to smart restaurants. The consumer economy boomed. When house prices started falling and interest rates began to rise, such feelings of wealth evaporated. People who are worried that they won't be able to pay their mortgage are not likely to spend their savings on other things. The consumer economy slumped. Unemployment rose, which exacerbated the problem. So is there such a risk to the economy this time round? The consensus is no. John Butler, UK economist at HSBC, points out that the economy is no longer being driven only by the strength of the housing market. Falling unemployment and the strength of equity markets are both big contributors to confidence. So even if the property market does turn down, it is unlikely to have the serious impact it had in the Eighties. But there will still, of course, be many casualties.",

This will not only protect borrowers from falling into negative equity but could also enable them to borrow more cheaply. Repayment mortgages also reduce the risk. </p> <p>He also suggests borrowers who move house should reduce their mortgage term so their loan ends at or before their expected retirement date.

He cites the example of someone earning \u00a325,000 a year buying a \u00a3100,000 property with a 25-year repayment mortgage. Assuming interest of 5.74 per cent, a homebuyer borrowing the full \u00a3100,000 or four times their income will pay \u00a3159 more than if they borrowed \u00a375,000. But if interest rates rose to 10 per cent, borrowing four times income would cost \u00a3230 more. Kennard recommends that homebuyers save as much as possible before looking for a property so they have a decent deposit. This will not only protect borrowers from falling into negative equity but could also enable them to borrow more cheaply. Repayment mortgages also reduce the risk. He also suggests borrowers who move house should reduce their mortgage term so their loan ends at or before their expected retirement date. 'Borrowers who keep taking out 25-year mortgages could end up having to pay a mortgage out of their pension,' he warns.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b> AC/DC</b> London Wembley Arena <p> I have a theory about AC/DC - a wispy thought that hits me halfway through their set. Their lead guitarist, Angus Young, is playing a guitar solo, balanced on a rising lift in one corner of the stage. Coaxing all manners of bluesy screams from his guitar, slowly riffing on the spot, Young glares demonically at the audience. He looks enraptured in his instrument's black noise. Robert Johnson, the old Mississippian blues guitarist who famously gave himself to the devil in 1938, seems momentarily reincarnated. </p> <p>This wasn't always the case. In the mid-Seventies, AC/DC ushered in the age of hard rock - innuendo-laden and musically forthright - to FM radio. The group set the foundations for their genre; Bon Scott's vocals evoked images of bleeding arteries, alongside Young's alcoholic blues riffs and a square rhythm section. A clutch of early albums, 1975's High Voltage , 1976's Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap and 1977's Let There Be Rock have been effortlessly recycled over a 25-year career. And the blueprint would later inspire US heavy metal (Guns 'n Roses, Hanoi Rocks), the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (Iron Maiden, Saxon) and grunge (Nirvana, Soundgarden). </p> <p>But Scott died in 1980, choking on his own vomit in the back of a friend's car. A new singer, Brian Johnson, resurrected the group's fortunes, producing the finest moment of their recording career - 1980's Back In Black. And over the past 20 years, the group has enjoyed steady success as an unpretentious but entertaining live act. Their dedication to the three-chord riff-- hardly the most adventurous of musical tangents - remains astounding. </p> <p>Brian Johnson now rations his voice down to a comfortable wheeze that alternates between a carburettor hum and a masonry drill: 'Ya doin' alright?', 'Are there any bad boys in the house?' Web-footed and awkward, he stands stage-edge, pounding his fists together -his audience, likewise, returns similar movements. The set-list weighs heavily towards the group's Bon Scott era - 'Whole Lotta Rosie', 'Let There Be Rock' and 'TNT'. </p> <p>But it's Young who provides the most melodramatic moments, stalking the stage in tiny, ferret-like movements - finally stripping off his trademark schoolboy uniform down to his shorts. A 25-foot tall, bronzed statue of him gazes out from the back of the stage -the idol breathes smoke, glinting its eyes across the crowd as fans chant 'Angus! Angus! Angus!' Young's presence - and the histrionics it produces - is the closest thing to idolatry in rock today. </p> <p>The guitarist, perhaps surprisingly, in recent years has been reclaimed as hard rock's solely functioning rock god - younger rock/rap groups such as US-based Limp Bizkit, Creed and Korn, perhaps conscious of their inattentive fanbase, encourage a democracy that shuns guitar solos. And while veterans like Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Buddy Guy have been redesigned by an MTV-generated sheen, Young seems to remember the sweatshop days of his youth in Sydney. </p> <p>The comparisons with Robert Johnson are irresistible - overlooking the obvious racial differences, the recorded output of both displays an economic use of guitars, reliant on riffs and nuances. Both were principally guitarists who catalogued the same interest in their lyrics - sex. On 'I'm a Steady Rollin' Man', re-corded in 1937, Johnson perforates his words with an insistent riff. He sings: 'I'm a steady rollin' man, I roll both night and day/But I haven't got no sweet woman, boys to be rollin' this-a-way.' </p> <p>Likewise, Young, the principal songwriter in AC/DC, wrote the similarly themed 'Highway To Hell' in 1979. Bon Scott's edgy vocals compete with Young's amped-up vision of Johnson's womanising: 'I'm on the highway to hell/No stop signs, no speed limit/Nobody's gonna slow me down/Like a wheel, gonna spin it/Nobody's gonna mess me around'. </p> <p>In 1937, perhaps predicting his own untimely death, Johnson penned 'Me and the Devil Blues': 'Me and the Devil was walkin' side by side/Me and the Devil, ooh, was walkin' side by side/And I'm going to beat my woman/Until I get satisfied'. 'Highway To Hell' is similarly full of devilish imagery, alternately pleading for absolution while fetishising the occult: 'Hey Satan, paid my dues/Playing in a rocking band/Hey Momma, look at me/I'm on my way to the promised land/I'm on a highway to hell'. It mightn't be any more than coincidence, of course. Only, Young instils the feeling that he might indeed have sold his soul to some otherworldly cause. Always lean and ragged, he looks beanpole thin these days, almost meditative in his craft. His bandmates seem peripheral as Young wields solos like a man running for the finishing line. </p> <p>The group's sexual fixations - no more sophisticated than adolescent fantasies - are legendary. On 'Hard As A Rock', as Johnson blares out the second verse - 'The lightnin' rod, strike it hot/Gonna hit you like a Rushmore rock/No nicotine, and no pipe dreams/So low and dirty it's damn right mean' - a cinema projector swings into view. Animated images of naked, purple-faced dwarves chasing voluptuous maidens race across the screen. As the rhythm section flails out the last chorus, German V2 rockets explode from battlefields, a train enters a tunnel and plumes of gaseous fire ejaculate from sidestage. </p> <p>All impossible to watch without grinning of course, and I leave still sniggering. Next morning, as the train shudders to a halt outside Kentish Town, I break into a smile. Perhaps the railroad metaphor isn't so clumsy after all: as Young well understands, every old Mississippian bluesman should fall on to the wrong side of the tracks.</p>",

      "body": "<b> Royal Ballet </b> Royal Opera House, London WC2 <p> Instead of cafeteria dance - a bit of this, a bit of that, something sweet at the end - a good mixed bill of ballets is like a well-chosen menu: each dish enhances another. Anthony Dowell's selection of English ballets to French music (until 20 December) is a five-star programme, excellently danced. </p> <p>It begins with a premonition of war and ends with an angry elegy. Kenneth MacMillan's closing Gloria, to Francis Poulenc's setting of part of the Latin Mass, summons the spirits of a lost generation. As ecstatic Amens ring out from the chorus in the orchestra pit, the dancers above them tilt their helmeted heads to one side. They are listening to the voices of the dead, whom they are about to join. The context of the ballet is the First World War but the soldiers could belong to any army, any era. </p> <p>Frederick Ashton's opening ballet, La Valse, has its waltzing couples whirling on the edge of the abyss suggested by Ravel's ominous music. The orchestra, which rumbles almost imperceptibly at the start, ends with a cataclysmic roar. The curtain rises and descends on a haunted ballroom: these demonic dancers, like the Wilis in Giselle, are trapped in time. There is a wonderful moment near the start when a woman in a red dress is swung into the air. Her flaring skirt is a distress beacon, doomed to go unanswered. </p> <p>Because Ravel's waltz rhythms slip and slide, the distinction in the dancing between hectic and messy is a close call, even with Emmanuel Plasson conducting. It's almost impossible for the men in black, coat-tails flying, to leap and land in unison. But Zenaida Yanowsky, long and willowy as the leading lady in white, is the clear focus of the swirling mass, the queen bee of the swarm. </p> <p>Ashton's Symphonic Variations (1946), created after the end of the Second World War, floats like the sigh of a long-held breath. The worst is behind. Ashton's magic trick is to ask for unaccented dancing: if the six soloists 'just do' the steps, without emphasising any at the expense of others, the choreography flows effortlessly on C\u00e9sar Franck's music. If the dancers are seen to try too hard - especially the two women, who have to keep pace with the fastest variation - they can look frantic. Belinda Hatley and Jaimie Tapper get it just right. Miyako Yoshida in the central role is blessed with a thistledown jump, so light that her partner, Inaki Urlezaga, seems scarcely to hold her. </p> <p>Antony Tudor's Lilac Garden (1936), at the heart of the programme, has been high on Dowell's wish-list of ballets for his farewell season as artistic director. The potential problem for audiences here is that Lilac Garden is a very English ballet, returning changed by its reincarnation in the United States, where Tudor emigrated in 1939. Its American curator, Sallie Wilson, has mounted it with French ballerina Sylvie Guillem in the leading role of Caroline. </p> <p>It could have been a travesty: instead, it's a gift to treasure. True, Guillem's style is too extravagant to be in period: the ballet is set in Edwardian times, when emotions were buttoned up behind a stiff upper lip. Caroline has to renounce her lover and marry a stick of a man she does not love - an unlikely sacrifice for a woman of Guillem's temperament. But she is a magnificent dance-actress, and she makes it work. </p> <p>Her high extensions when she dances with her lover are in great contrast with her submissive posture towards her husband-to-be. She absents her true self from her encounters with the man she must marry: she can't bear to touch him or meet his eyes. He takes her away from her life at the end, renouncing his past as well. Everyone in the lilac-drenched garden is in collusion, covering up for each other, preserving the facade. </p> <p>All the young men are in dress-uniform. In the context of this programme, their military bearing is a reminder that their world is about to crack apart. The pretty girls who try to console Caroline's broken-hearted lover will soon be bandaging his wounds. Like Ashton's waltzers and MacMillan's soldiers, Tudor's Edwardians shield their eyes in pain.</p>",

Ashton's magic trick is to ask for unaccented dancing: if the six soloists 'just do' the steps, without emphasising any at the expense of others, the choreography flows effortlessly on C\u00e9sar Franck's music. If the dancers are seen to try too hard - especially the two women, who have to keep pace with the fastest variation - they can look frantic. Belinda Hatley and Jaimie Tapper get it just right. Miyako Yoshida in the central role is blessed with a thistledown jump, so light that her partner, Inaki Urlezaga, seems scarcely to hold her. Antony Tudor's Lilac Garden (1936), at the heart of the programme, has been high on Dowell's wish-list of ballets for his farewell season as artistic director. The potential problem for audiences here is that Lilac Garden is a very English ballet, returning changed by its reincarnation in the United States, where Tudor emigrated in 1939. Its American curator, Sallie Wilson, has mounted it with French ballerina Sylvie Guillem in the leading role of Caroline. It could have been a travesty: instead, it's a gift to treasure. True, Guillem's style is too extravagant to be in period: the ballet is set in Edwardian times, when emotions were buttoned up behind a stiff upper lip. Caroline has to renounce her lover and marry a stick of a man she does not love - an unlikely sacrifice for a woman of Guillem's temperament. But she is a magnificent dance-actress, and she makes it work. Her high extensions when she dances with her lover are in great contrast with her submissive posture towards her husband-to-be. She absents her true self from her encounters with the man she must marry: she can't bear to touch him or meet his eyes. He takes her away from her life at the end, renouncing his past as well. Everyone in the lilac-drenched garden is in collusion, covering up for each other, preserving the facade. All the young men are in dress-uniform. In the context of this programme, their military bearing is a reminder that their world is about to crack apart. The pretty girls who try to console Caroline's broken-hearted lover will soon be bandaging his wounds. Like Ashton's waltzers and MacMillan's soldiers, Tudor's Edwardians shield their eyes in pain.",

It is an emotional art form both on and off the stage (and not only in London). Scottish Opera has endured severe financial hardships in the past few seasons, compounded by administrative muddle and loss of key personnel. Yet its productions, with only one or two exceptions, have been outstanding. Musical standards remain high and musicians perform with palpable enthusiasm. Somewhere, someone has had the imagination to secure exceptional combinations of singers and artists. </p> <p>The results have been impressive. Their Wagner earlier this year - Parsifal and Rheingold - won high praise. Now a new Madama Butterfly produced by David McVicar, fresh from his radical staging of La Boh\u00e8me for Glyndebourne Touring Opera, adds to the company's roster of accomplishments. </p> <p>In contrast to his Boh\u00e8me, this Butterfly observes convention down to the smallest detail. The argument that the more popular an opera is, the more it requires updating, conceptualising or generally messing around simply does not apply to Butterfly . Puccini's realisation of the true-life story of a young geisha girl who marries, and then is deserted by Pinkerton, a brash American naval officer, defies attempts to separate it from its cultural context. The musical content in effect forbids it: five Japanese folk songs and pentatonic motifs are woven into the score together with Sousa's 'The Stars and Stripes Forever'. Not much scope for concentration camp, espresso bar or inner-city wasteland settings here (though doubtless they have been tried). </p> <p>Yannis Thavoris, the designer, has created a clean, handsome set in which eccentric particulars (such as the tilted perspective) offset tradition and familiarity. All is minimal, in echt Japanese style. A teahouse of seemingly perfect authenticity fills the stage, its flimsy sliding panels - upon which Pinkerton snidely comments - implying a fragility at the heart of this make-believe love nest. In Act II, it adapts to become the house interior. In each case, the structure of the house creates framed images in which the action takes place. Butterfly wears a version of geisha costume and arranges her only belongings - a clasp, a clay pot, the dagger with which her father killed himself - on a small shrine to one side. Her censorious family dresses in sober Edwardian costume (the work was premiered in 1904), as if at once flirting with foreign customs while yet condemning Butterfly for falling prey to their very charms. </p> <p>One of McVicar's strengths as a director is his ability to push singers to explore the dramatic potential of their characters. Here, as in Boh\u00e8me, Puccini's apparently two-dimensional figures (they are often portrayed as such) can take on greater psychological depth, enabling us to hear with new, bright clarity what the music is telling us. Pinkerton can seem merely a rudimentarily cruel xenophobe and no more. Here, expressively sung by Ian Storey, he seemed almost poignant - genuinely captivated by Butterfly, blindly and clumsily unaware of his power over her. His actions are shockingly crass, while his musical character is strangely vulnerable. For the first time, he won our sympathy. </p> <p>When he returns, married to an American bride, his remorse at finding the faithful Butterfly still waiting for him seems real. No longer is this merely a bathetic tale of cultural imperialism but a human love triangle in which Pinkerton, at the centre, has wholly misjudged the situation. There is nothing here that we don't already know, but McVicar has made the drama boldly convincing. Without tricks or gimmickry, he has added salt to the cloying sweetness of this dangerously sentimental drama. Indulgently done, no opera makes one more inclined to share Britten's view of Puccini ('I think his operas are dreadful'). But mawkishness is kept to a minimum in this brisk, thoughtful production. </p> <p>Guido Ajmone-Marsan, conducting, must take much of the credit. He tackled the edgily contrapuntal orchestral opening with an attack which showed he meant business. The orchestra responded with zest and pre cision, sustaining momentum throughout the evening yet saving enough passion for the grand, tear-jerking climax. In the title role, the Azerbaijani soprano Natalia Dercho demonstrated intensity, fervour and intelligence. Her powerful voice has a slightly rasping edge. If this perhaps reduced the usual tenderness or fragility of the child-bride, it nevertheless added emotional depth. Peter Van Hulle's simpering, whining Goro was excellent and Jason Howard, despite a heavy cold, brought insight and troubled humanity to the role of Sharpless, with Jane Irwin equally touching as the maid Suzuki. As Butterfly's young son, forced to watch his mother destroy herself, Sam Aschavir pulled our collective heartstrings and stole the show. </p> <p>Another small boy could be said to have stolen the show at the opening ceremony of the Great Court of the British Museum. The eight-year-old Mozart's short sacred piece, 'God is our Refuge and Strength', was sung by in-house singers on Wednesday night. This motet is the first vocal composition in the Kochel catalogue (the list of Mozart's works compiled by an admiring botanist nearly a century later).

Live, its creator seems an almost marginal figure, sitting behind his keyboards to one side of the stage while a succession of vocal talents take turns with his songs, and a deftly edited barrage of images and film clips provides visual commentary upon them. With a string quartet and a busy rhythm section also in play, the show works better then one might imagine, building a series of enchanting moments into an uplifting experience. </p> <p>Many of the highlights were provided by the lanky, bearded figure of Jayanta Gose, a singer of wondrous quality. After an opening wail straight from a temple courtyard, set to tremulous bass synth and with a shot of planet earth to go with it, he moved on to some soaring, meditative melodies for numbers like 'Vidya'. He was soon holding his own in an Anglo-Hindi rapping duel with JC001, a bounding figure who is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the fastest rapper alive. Propelled by a tabla blitz, the exchange of phonetic fisticuffs between the two men is a phenomenon you won't see anywhere else. </p> <p>Entirely different shades were provided by Sawhney's three female vocalists. Tina Grace delivered a new song, 'Cold and Intimate', which was laced with a bluesy, rocky feel. Nina Miranda, of Brazilian group Smoke City, lent her lilting samba tones to 'Homelands', a number that wafts breezily between Rio and Bombay. Then there was Eska, blasting soulfully forth alongside Jayanta Bose on 'Immigrant', and various other combinations to keep the palate refreshed. </p> <p>Sawhney himself is content to act as musical director, periodically turning aside from his keyboards to pick and strum at an acoustic Spanish guitar, threading delicate flamenco lines through numbers. Flamenco and North Indian classical, he contends, are close relations, and he has the music to prove it. </p> <p>Towards the end, the mood shifted soberly to 'Beyond Skin', a commentary on nuclear weapons (no minor issue where India and Pakistan are concerned), with Robert Oppenheimer's quotation from Indian scripture, 'Now I am become death, Vishnu, the destroyer of worlds', on the screen. For a finale there was 'Broken Skin', a number soaked in jazz-funk influences which were also apparent on the encore - a massed rendition of the clubland favourite, Nuyorican Soul's 'Black Gold of the Sun'. </p> <p>It was a masterful performance, drawing a line beneath Beyond Skin . Next month he sets off to draw inspiration from sources as disparate as South Africa, Aboriginal Australia and Native America - while collaborations with Sting and Algeria's Cheb Mami are in the bag for his next record.

Live, its creator seems an almost marginal figure, sitting behind his keyboards to one side of the stage while a succession of vocal talents take turns with his songs, and a deftly edited barrage of images and film clips provides visual commentary upon them. With a string quartet and a busy rhythm section also in play, the show works better then one might imagine, building a series of enchanting moments into an uplifting experience. Many of the highlights were provided by the lanky, bearded figure of Jayanta Gose, a singer of wondrous quality. After an opening wail straight from a temple courtyard, set to tremulous bass synth and with a shot of planet earth to go with it, he moved on to some soaring, meditative melodies for numbers like 'Vidya'. He was soon holding his own in an Anglo-Hindi rapping duel with JC001, a bounding figure who is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the fastest rapper alive. Propelled by a tabla blitz, the exchange of phonetic fisticuffs between the two men is a phenomenon you won't see anywhere else. Entirely different shades were provided by Sawhney's three female vocalists. Tina Grace delivered a new song, 'Cold and Intimate', which was laced with a bluesy, rocky feel. Nina Miranda, of Brazilian group Smoke City, lent her lilting samba tones to 'Homelands', a number that wafts breezily between Rio and Bombay. Then there was Eska, blasting soulfully forth alongside Jayanta Bose on 'Immigrant', and various other combinations to keep the palate refreshed. Sawhney himself is content to act as musical director, periodically turning aside from his keyboards to pick and strum at an acoustic Spanish guitar, threading delicate flamenco lines through numbers. Flamenco and North Indian classical, he contends, are close relations, and he has the music to prove it. Towards the end, the mood shifted soberly to 'Beyond Skin', a commentary on nuclear weapons (no minor issue where India and Pakistan are concerned), with Robert Oppenheimer's quotation from Indian scripture, 'Now I am become death, Vishnu, the destroyer of worlds', on the screen. For a finale there was 'Broken Skin', a number soaked in jazz-funk influences which were also apparent on the encore - a massed rendition of the clubland favourite, Nuyorican Soul's 'Black Gold of the Sun'. It was a masterful performance, drawing a line beneath Beyond Skin . Next month he sets off to draw inspiration from sources as disparate as South Africa, Aboriginal Australia and Native America - while collaborations with Sting and Algeria's Cheb Mami are in the bag for his next record. Watch his space.",

An ill-prepared astrophysicist and his wife (a lawyer, but that's not her main point) are obliged to entertain a couple who might offer the husband professional advancement. In the first (the funniest) version, the wails of a child punctuate the action; in another, the infant is pronounced unusually self-sufficient.

Together, these actors present a masterclass in comic timing. </p> <p>An entirely different lesson is to be learnt from Max Stafford-Clark's production of <strong> Rita, Sue and Bob Too</strong>. Andrea Dunbar's play, set on a Bradford council estate, was first staged in 1982: it's lost none of its conviction. Two 15-year-old schoolgirls cop off with a married man, taking it in enthusiastic turn to have a 'jump' with him in his car: ankle socks wave in the air, rubber johnnies slosh around alarmingly. </p> <p>Within Es Devlin's coal-black cave of a design - in which windows turn out to be television screens - are enacted divorce, a pregnancy, a major street row, a muted feminist ending. The play carries its themes lightly. The dialogue is punchy and funny. The girls are brilliantly played by Emily Aston and Emma Rydal: vigorously fleshy, vocally deadpan, hilarious, callous and loyal. Thatcherite policies are glimpsed obliquely: men who lose their jobs lose their cars - and their potency. </p> <p>Dunbar was writing about the world she came from: she did so with the confidence of an insider. The other half of the Soho double bill is Robin Soans's <strong> A State Affair</strong>, a compilation of interviews conducted this year on Dunbar's estate. These interleaved first-hand accounts have the anti-climactic ebb-and-flow structure of documentary; they are performed with a combination of naturalism and rhetoric. They show that things have got worse since Dunbar's day: the old fear was pregnancy; the new fear is death from drugs.

Well, what is that intangible, but instantly recognisable, quality that gives A the edge over B and C? </p> <p>It's all relative, of course. The answers to these questions will vary from country to country, from community to community. In America, it's a fair bet that Time and Newsweek will reflect the values of their society and choose someone like Hillary Clinton or Madonna or - perish the thought - George Dubya. In France, such polls have nominated philosophers, artists, latter-day militants like eco-protesting farmer Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, generals and film stars. But in Britain - what, or rather, who? </p> <p>Do we, for instance, really subscribe to the cult of celebrity ? Is fame - and yet more fame - what matters? Or do we, in our secret hearts, want to redress the balance of power, to break away from an agenda set by an omnivorous, and seemingly omniscient, news media? Dorothy Parker, a woman who knew a thing or two about the workings of the press and its values, once wrote: 'I'm never going to be famous. My name will never be writ large on the roster of Those Who Do Things. I don't do anything. Not one single thing. I used to bite my nails, but I don't even do that any more.' </p> <p>From the catalogue of Those Who Do Things, but glancing away from the headlines and the morning blare of the Today programme, should we recognise fearless Don Hale, the editor of the Matlock Mercury whose long campaign to free Stephen Downing (wrongly jailed for 27 years for a murder he did not commit) looks to be on the brink of vindication? There can can be few finer achievements in recent journalism. Or should we pick out Sir Nicholas Serota, the man behind Tate Modern? Or Tim Smit, the eco-dome fanatic from Cornwall whose vision of a better future environment will speak urgently to thousands of waterlogged home-owners? Or Pam Warren, 'the lady in the mask' who so bravely gave evidence at the Paddington rail inquiry? Or Joanne Rowling, for giving so many millions of hours of reading pleasure to so many millions of all ages? Or Steve Redgrave, that 'oar-some' Olympic champion?

Is it to do with power or success or charisma or triumphing over adversity, or what? Is it political, commercial, artistic or spiritual? Is it courage, dedication or performance? Is it..? Well, what is that intangible, but instantly recognisable, quality that gives A the edge over B and C? It's all relative, of course. The answers to these questions will vary from country to country, from community to community. In America, it's a fair bet that Time and Newsweek will reflect the values of their society and choose someone like Hillary Clinton or Madonna or - perish the thought - George Dubya. In France, such polls have nominated philosophers, artists, latter-day militants like eco-protesting farmer Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, generals and film stars. But in Britain - what, or rather, who? Do we, for instance, really subscribe to the cult of celebrity ? Is fame - and yet more fame - what matters? Or do we, in our secret hearts, want to redress the balance of power, to break away from an agenda set by an omnivorous, and seemingly omniscient, news media? Dorothy Parker, a woman who knew a thing or two about the workings of the press and its values, once wrote: 'I'm never going to be famous. My name will never be writ large on the roster of Those Who Do Things. I don't do anything. Not one single thing. I used to bite my nails, but I don't even do that any more.' From the catalogue of Those Who Do Things, but glancing away from the headlines and the morning blare of the Today programme, should we recognise fearless Don Hale, the editor of the Matlock Mercury whose long campaign to free Stephen Downing (wrongly jailed for 27 years for a murder he did not commit) looks to be on the brink of vindication? There can can be few finer achievements in recent journalism. Or should we pick out Sir Nicholas Serota, the man behind Tate Modern? Or Tim Smit, the eco-dome fanatic from Cornwall whose vision of a better future environment will speak urgently to thousands of waterlogged home-owners? Or Pam Warren, 'the lady in the mask' who so bravely gave evidence at the Paddington rail inquiry? Or Joanne Rowling, for giving so many millions of hours of reading pleasure to so many millions of all ages? Or Steve Redgrave, that 'oar-some' Olympic champion? Or Nigella Lawson for her grace, charm and fortitude? Or the amazingly talented Susan Greenfield, for making science as approachable as high-heels?

      "body": "<p><strong> Human Image</strong> Joseph Hotung Great Court Gallery, British Museum, London WC1 until 11 February </p> <p> Far above the Great Court a tiny plane glides by, its vapour trail hyphenated in the immense lattice of Norman Foster's glass roof. The whole sky seems to be contained in this rival canopy. Light chases across its vaulting expanse, clouds cast shadows on the marble courtyard below. Watch long enough and you might see the Milky Way appear. You feel yourself shrink as you look. </p> <p>Bigger than the Turbine Hall, higher than the Dome, the Great Court dwarfs everything in sight. It wants you to be lost in awe, amazed by the architecture, dazzled by its canyon of pale, gleaming stone. The scale is completely inhuman - how could it not be? Foster's canopy has to accommodate a quartet of neoclassical facades, the largest courtyard in Europe and the full height of the Reading Room, its dome even larger than St Paul's. All the pigeons in Trafalgar Square could wing through this space and seem no more than a pinch of confetti. </p> <p>Enter through any of the four grand doors and you immediately become part of the spectacle, a walk-on in the Library Scene, an extra in the milling crowd. Gaze up at the broad, spiral stair case that wraps around the Reading Room and you see others leaning over the bannisters like passengers at the prow of the Titanic. Climb those steps yourself and you can look way down into Sydney Smirke's great rotunda and see your fellow actors wandering the set with its authentic props: the desk where Karl Marx wrote Das Kapital, the catalogues where vanished readers once prospected for books. </p> <p>Presuming on his modesty, I don't believe Foster would claim any more for his designs than that they enhance what already existed. His stairways take you inches from the roof of those neoclassical facades, put you on a level with Smirke's fabulous cupola, where you can see the original latticework from which Foster so clearly took his cue. He has clarified the British Museum's muddled layout by making the Great Court its central hub - and he's done it by illuminating the architectural past. The only confusion left is the museum's baffling, even shocking response. </p> <p>'A vibrant meeting place' is the museum's telling description of the Great Court, as if it were no more than a mall full of caf\u00e9s and shops selling lattice-pattern ties. Monumental sculptures have been installed beside the four doors as 'markers' to the different wings. An Easter Island statue, once vast, is now reduced to another face in the crowd - albeit magnificently stern - beside a busy exit. The monumental lion that crowned a cliff edge in Turkey, four centuries before Christ, now acts as a handy signpost to the Asian collection. As for the Joseph Hotung Gallery itself, in which objects are jammed like ornaments in a cupboard, I guess it's a shorthand 'taster' for the rest of the museum. </p> <p>The gallery is a meagre space, a curve of corridor up near the roof that feels like an awkward attic. It is far too small for the 100 works in 'Human Image', the opening exhibition. If they were hairpins, stamps and toby jugs, it might just be big enough. But these are some of the largest, not to say greatest, treasures anywhere in the museum - marble goddesses, golden gods, tall totems with elaborate ritual scars. Michelangelo's sketch for the Sistine Adam could do with a wall to itself. The stunning Discobolus, a classical athlete compressing all his rippling power into one fling of the discus, would fill the gallery in its own right. </p> <p>Still, the curators have made the best of their lot, dividing this tight space into nine separate zones - Creation, Devotion, Power and so forth, any category broad enough to unite an Estonian banknote, say, and a statue of Mao in the same notional bracket. These zones are eccentric. The Greek Nereid you might expect to find under Perfection appears in the Drapery department, her tunic contrasted with the Fortuny pleats of an Egyptian monarch. Meanwhile, the Degas drawing of woman alongside is not remotely concerned with drapes. What's so startling here is that the woman looks straight back at you through a pair of binoculars - as if caught on early Kodak in a Paris crowd. </p> <p>Clearly, these categories are meant to tease. Shouldn't Mao be in Power? Doesn't this amazing bronze Hercules deserve to be in Portraits, since it looks exactly like a Scorsese mafioso? Why is this African head, its features so exquisitely refined, in Abstraction instead of Perfection? The answer to that one lies in Picasso's sketch for Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, placed just beyond it in a cunning sightline. </p> <p>Spot the likeness, make the connection: that's the idea behind this show. But the associations it sets up are often meaningless and visually trite. A bust of sightless Homer is reflected in the glass protecting a Japanese watercolour of Diogenes: two greybeards - so what? A crystal skull sits next to a sinister Aztec mask, made from a human skull inlaid with turquoise and jet, two spheres of glinting pyrite for eyeballs. The juxtaposition makes dead-heads of them both, yet the mask is that most extraordinary leap of imagination: an image of the Mexican god Tezcatlipoca, a likeness of something - or someone - that cannot be seen. </p> <p>So many of the objects in this show were made to awe and unsettle. They were vested with powers that Western art hasn't been able to muster for centuries. How they were once seen, what they were for: you get at least some sense of this when you come across them in the museum's separate collections. Out of context, shoehorned in with Picasso and the rest, they are merely presented as unusual examples of the human image; worse, as source material for modern art. </p> <p>It might be argued that nothing could diminish the impact of the Mayan maize god, so beautiful in his erotic trance. Or the thirteenth-century ivory Virgin, leaning back to get a prouder look at the child in her lap. Or the tiny Buddha, desert winds lifting his fragile robes. But jam them all together in a frantic cocktail party and you can barely see them, let alone experience their charisma. Just as the Great Court now looks like a giant computer graphic, flawless, smooth and utterly impersonal, so this show, in the words of the chief curator, is meant to function like hypertext. Why not, in that case, consign all these pointless cross-references to one of the computers in the Reading Room and allow these great works of art to speak uniquely for themselves?</p>",

Wear your favourite flats by all means this Christmas, but realise that you'll be making a statement. To blend, you need to soar. </p> <p>There are no easy answers as to why heels are suddenly sky high. In the past they have been used for both affected decoration (all those Restoration dandies) and sensible foot protection (raised clogs evolved from a desire to avoid street debris in pre-sanitation industrial towns). </p> <p>The fashion historian Professor Elizabeth Wilson of the University of North London thinks it may be a way of marking out the present moment as different from what has gone before. 'For the past few years young women have been wearing trainers everywhere - to parties, to the office, as well as to the gym. High heels are an extreme reaction to that, a way of saying that the saturation of fashion by sports clothing is finally over.' In which case, Miu Miu's attempt last year to mix elements of both by producing trainers with huge heels starts to make a strange (if hideous) kind of sense. </p> <p>Wilson points out, too, that the current focus on heels may be simply pragmatic, a response to the fact that there's not a lot of leeway when it comes to playing around with shoe design. 'Like all clothing, shoes have a basic and unchanging function, which is to keep you protected from the environment. But whereas a jacket can be all sorts of shapes and sizes and still do its job, a shoe is much more constrained. The heel is one part of the structure that you can alter without compromising the whole enterprise.' </p> <p>There are economic forces at work, too. Fashion's obsession with novelty is a way of making sure we spend money on new clothing before the old stuff has worn out. And over the past few years accessories, and shoes in particular, have proved themselves particularly profitable. 'Shoes and bags are comparatively cheap to produce,' explains Alice Rawsthorn, the architecture and design critic. 'Some time ago clever design companies like Prada and Gucci realised that there was much more money to be made in shoes and accessories than in other kinds of high-fashion items. They threw their best design talent in that direction, and the result has been an outpouring of creativity.' </p> <p>As a result shoes, or certain brands of shoes, have achieved a kind of iconic presence, even among those who don't usually consider themselves footwear-oriented. Go into Prada's flagship store in Bond Street on a rainy Monday and you will see gaggles of women, all ages and sizes, patting and murmuring over rocket-heels which start at \u00a3200. </p> <p> I recently succumbed and bought a pair. They look like something a mill girl might have worn for a date with a visiting GI. The heel is clunky and, crucially, four inches high. There is a lot of top stitching, reprising the look of this season's crucial Prada bowling bag (matching your shoes and bag, if you can afford it, is no longer confined to Hyacinth Bouquet). </p> <p>I know I should feel foxy, but on the couple of occasions I've worn my new shoes I feel like a little girl who has been rummaging in the dressing-up box (either that, or an unconvincing transvestite). Half a size too big (that's no one's fault but mine), I have to clench my toes and, every other part of me in order to stay upright. Far from sashaying around parties with a tall and eager stride, I shuffle like a Chinese adolescent who hasn't got used to her footbinding. Of course, if you're good at these things, like Naomi Campbell, you can fall off your platforms, laugh like a drain, and everyone thinks it's fresh and cute. I tried it and people thought I was drunk. </p> <p>Clearly I'm unusual, though, since it is female desire for high heels which is making them walk out of the shops in such phenomenal numbers. Shoe designer Emma Hope believes that women buy them for the simple reason that they make them look fantastic. 'The most ordinary leg looks long and sexy when it's perched on top of an extra three inches. A good ankle becomes an elegant one, and thighs and hips look magically thinner.' Wendy Dagworthy, Professor of Fashion at the Royal College of Art, says that there's something about even a modest kitten heel that makes you suddenly aware of your posture and automatically stand up taller. </p> <p>Of course, this all assumes that you know how to pick out the right pair of shoes in the first place. The key thing this winter is to team your heels with trousers rather than skirts, short or otherwise. Realising the potential for turning out like white trash, Red magazine helpfully devotes its lead fashion feature this month to achieving a shoe-trouser match which aims for YSL while avoiding Loughton. </p> <p>But other kinds of pleasure are in play. High heels set in motion all kinds of desires, visual or otherwise, in both men and women. Beatrice Faust, an academic commentator on fashion, believes that wearing high heels 'makes the buttocks undulate about twice as much as walking in flat heels, with correspondingly greater sensation transmitted to the vulva,' which could explain why the woman standing next to you in her Manolo Blahniks looks quite so cheerful. Men also seem to pick up on the physical re-alignment that high heels involve. Pelvis and breasts are thrust forward, bottom tucked under and yet, as Faust observes, simultaneously jiggling about. It's about as graphic as you can get while still keeping your clothes on. And then there's Alison Lurie's theory. According to her classic The Language of Clothes, an extended leg is a sign of sexual availability in several animal groups: a pair of heels from Gucci, she believes, sends the same message among humans. </p> <p>All this comes marinaded with a bit of light-hearted sado-masochism. Once she puts on her Pradas, an average-sized woman knows she will tower over at least half the men in the room. 'It doesn't make me feel remotely unfeminine to talk down to a man. I love the feeling,' says Alice Rawsthorn, (5ft 6in in her stockinged feet). Emma Hope (5ft 8in) concurs: 'I've never known any of my customers mind about being taller than their partners. The only exception is on their wedding day, when they worry it might look a bit odd. The big fear then is looking like Bernie Ecclestone and his wife.' </p> <p>In case anyone should doubt that the way a woman feels about her heels is intimately entwined with her stance towards her partner, you have only to look at the cautionary tale of Diana, Princess of Wales. In the early years of her marriage, when she was desperate to make Charles love her, the 5ft 10in youngster wore shoes as flat as ballet pumps. By the early Nineties, when she had given up on him, she was towering over him in killer spikes. </p> <p>The dominatrix effect of high heels doesn't stop there. The click-clack sound they make on hard flooring announces your arrival in a satisfyingly strict way, and you also find yourself becoming more assertive in your movements. </p> <p>'Since heels are more difficult to walk in, it means that you don't waste a single bit of energy', says Hope. 'When I'm wearing them I'm able to stride boldly through rooms full of people, rather than scuttling round the outside, just because I don't want to put myself to any extra discomfort.' </p> <p>There's also a hint of danger too. Stiletto, after all, means 'little dagger' and the combination of spiky heel and pointy toe means that a shoe can turn into a cruel and handy weapon in a moment. 'Last year Gucci did some black patent shoes with a steel heel which men seemed to find incredibly exciting,' remembers Rawsthorn, who also admits that the steel heels were incredibly uncomfortable to wear. </p> <p>It plays, of course, on the whole S and M fantasy. The woman, who is usually smaller, weaker and more vulnerable, has temporarily become the strong, dangerous predator. </p> <p>'Temporarily', though, is the key word here. As in all sado-masochistic fantasies, the power imbalance must be safely negotiable and reversible for the fantasy to work. The situation is sexy because at any moment the woman can take off her shoes (or, more crucially, be told to take them off) and go back to being a stumpy and unthreatening 5ft 4in. </p> <p>Which begs the question whether high heels are the sort of thing that any good feminist should be seen dead in. They throw up all the tensions which surrounded the Wonderbra several years back. Do women pad out their breasts for their own pleasure or for men's? Eva Herzogovina seemed pretty thrilled with hers in the original Wonderbra advert, but you can't spend your whole time peering down your own cleavage. Likewise, although you may feel like a big, sexy girl in your high heels, it's impossible to see the things unless you're sitting down. Is it the male gaze rather than yours which is being catered to? </p> <p>Alice Rawsthorn has thought long and hard about the issue. 'As a young, educated, independent woman in the mid-Eighties, I absolutely refused to wear high heels. I felt that to do so would have been to send out the wrong message about how I wanted to be seen. It would have been like betraying my gender.' </p> <p>But something has happened since then, and by the early Nineties Rawsthorn had become a dedicated wearer of high heels, with a particular passion for Manolo Blahnik, which have now become something of a signature for her. 'As women achieved more real economic and social power in the late Eighties, those old Stalinist dictates about what a good feminist should and shouldn't wear fell away,' explains Rawsthorn. 'Independent, educated, professional women are now sufficiently secure not to have to worry about whether a pair of high heels sends out the wrong message.' </p> <p>Post-feminist or not, Rawsthorn still refuses to do cleavage, even during a season when every V-neck sweater is slashed to the navel. 'That, to me, still seems to generate the wrong signals about femininity. But I have a friend who feels the complete opposite. She doesn't mind showing cleavage, but she absolutely refuses to do high heels. The key word here is choice.' </p> <p>And choice, indeed, also explains why the old feminist argument about high heels ruining women's feet and spines while laying them open to attack (no chance to run from a mugger) no longer holds water. 'The difference with high heels this time around is that women aren't wearing them all day, every day, like they did in the Forties and Fifties,' says Professor Elizabeth Wilson. 'As a result they're not developing the hammer toes and bunions which bedevilled an earlier generation.' </p> <p>Wendy Dagworthy recalls with a shudder the 'perpetual pain' she experienced in the Seventies and Eighties from constantly wearing high heels, and swears that she will never put herself through it again, no matter how fashionable they might be. Among her young and trend-conscious students, however, she notes that high heels are worn only sporadically, and juggled with trainers. </p> <p>Rawsthorn concurs: 'I wear Manolos out to dinner and Nikes during the day. And as for the safety issues, I always drive or walk to my destination in flat shoes and then change when I get there. There's no way that wearing heels means that I've compromised my health, safety or anything else.'</p>",

I tried it and people thought I was drunk. Clearly I'm unusual, though, since it is female desire for high heels which is making them walk out of the shops in such phenomenal numbers. Shoe designer Emma Hope believes that women buy them for the simple reason that they make them look fantastic. 'The most ordinary leg looks long and sexy when it's perched on top of an extra three inches. A good ankle becomes an elegant one, and thighs and hips look magically thinner.' Wendy Dagworthy, Professor of Fashion at the Royal College of Art, says that there's something about even a modest kitten heel that makes you suddenly aware of your posture and automatically stand up taller. Of course, this all assumes that you know how to pick out the right pair of shoes in the first place. The key thing this winter is to team your heels with trousers rather than skirts, short or otherwise. Realising the potential for turning out like white trash, Red magazine helpfully devotes its lead fashion feature this month to achieving a shoe-trouser match which aims for YSL while avoiding Loughton. But other kinds of pleasure are in play. High heels set in motion all kinds of desires, visual or otherwise, in both men and women. Beatrice Faust, an academic commentator on fashion, believes that wearing high heels 'makes the buttocks undulate about twice as much as walking in flat heels, with correspondingly greater sensation transmitted to the vulva,' which could explain why the woman standing next to you in her Manolo Blahniks looks quite so cheerful. Men also seem to pick up on the physical re-alignment that high heels involve. Pelvis and breasts are thrust forward, bottom tucked under and yet, as Faust observes, simultaneously jiggling about. It's about as graphic as you can get while still keeping your clothes on. And then there's Alison Lurie's theory. According to her classic The Language of Clothes, an extended leg is a sign of sexual availability in several animal groups: a pair of heels from Gucci, she believes, sends the same message among humans. All this comes marinaded with a bit of light-hearted sado-masochism. Once she puts on her Pradas, an average-sized woman knows she will tower over at least half the men in the room. 'It doesn't make me feel remotely unfeminine to talk down to a man. I love the feeling,' says Alice Rawsthorn, (5ft 6in in her stockinged feet). Emma Hope (5ft 8in) concurs: 'I've never known any of my customers mind about being taller than their partners. The only exception is on their wedding day, when they worry it might look a bit odd. The big fear then is looking like Bernie Ecclestone and his wife.' In case anyone should doubt that the way a woman feels about her heels is intimately entwined with her stance towards her partner, you have only to look at the cautionary tale of Diana, Princess of Wales. In the early years of her marriage, when she was desperate to make Charles love her, the 5ft 10in youngster wore shoes as flat as ballet pumps. By the early Nineties, when she had given up on him, she was towering over him in killer spikes. The dominatrix effect of high heels doesn't stop there. The click-clack sound they make on hard flooring announces your arrival in a satisfyingly strict way, and you also find yourself becoming more assertive in your movements. 'Since heels are more difficult to walk in, it means that you don't waste a single bit of energy', says Hope. 'When I'm wearing them I'm able to stride boldly through rooms full of people, rather than scuttling round the outside, just because I don't want to put myself to any extra discomfort.' There's also a hint of danger too. Stiletto, after all, means 'little dagger' and the combination of spiky heel and pointy toe means that a shoe can turn into a cruel and handy weapon in a moment. 'Last year Gucci did some black patent shoes with a steel heel which men seemed to find incredibly exciting,' remembers Rawsthorn, who also admits that the steel heels were incredibly uncomfortable to wear. It plays, of course, on the whole S and M fantasy. The woman, who is usually smaller, weaker and more vulnerable, has temporarily become the strong, dangerous predator. 'Temporarily', though, is the key word here. As in all sado-masochistic fantasies, the power imbalance must be safely negotiable and reversible for the fantasy to work. The situation is sexy because at any moment the woman can take off her shoes (or, more crucially, be told to take them off) and go back to being a stumpy and unthreatening 5ft 4in. Which begs the question whether high heels are the sort of thing that any good feminist should be seen dead in. They throw up all the tensions which surrounded the Wonderbra several years back. Do women pad out their breasts for their own pleasure or for men's? Eva Herzogovina seemed pretty thrilled with hers in the original Wonderbra advert, but you can't spend your whole time peering down your own cleavage. Likewise, although you may feel like a big, sexy girl in your high heels, it's impossible to see the things unless you're sitting down. Is it the male gaze rather than yours which is being catered to? Alice Rawsthorn has thought long and hard about the issue. 'As a young, educated, independent woman in the mid-Eighties, I absolutely refused to wear high heels. I felt that to do so would have been to send out the wrong message about how I wanted to be seen. It would have been like betraying my gender.' But something has happened since then, and by the early Nineties Rawsthorn had become a dedicated wearer of high heels, with a particular passion for Manolo Blahnik, which have now become something of a signature for her. 'As women achieved more real economic and social power in the late Eighties, those old Stalinist dictates about what a good feminist should and shouldn't wear fell away,' explains Rawsthorn. 'Independent, educated, professional women are now sufficiently secure not to have to worry about whether a pair of high heels sends out the wrong message.' Post-feminist or not, Rawsthorn still refuses to do cleavage, even during a season when every V-neck sweater is slashed to the navel. 'That, to me, still seems to generate the wrong signals about femininity. But I have a friend who feels the complete opposite. She doesn't mind showing cleavage, but she absolutely refuses to do high heels. The key word here is choice.' And choice, indeed, also explains why the old feminist argument about high heels ruining women's feet and spines while laying them open to attack (no chance to run from a mugger) no longer holds water. 'The difference with high heels this time around is that women aren't wearing them all day, every day, like they did in the Forties and Fifties,' says Professor Elizabeth Wilson. 'As a result they're not developing the hammer toes and bunions which bedevilled an earlier generation.' Wendy Dagworthy recalls with a shudder the 'perpetual pain' she experienced in the Seventies and Eighties from constantly wearing high heels, and swears that she will never put herself through it again, no matter how fashionable they might be. Among her young and trend-conscious students, however, she notes that high heels are worn only sporadically, and juggled with trainers. Rawsthorn concurs: 'I wear Manolos out to dinner and Nikes during the day. And as for the safety issues, I always drive or walk to my destination in flat shoes and then change when I get there. There's no way that wearing heels means that I've compromised my health, safety or anything else.'",

      "body": "<p>Last week the newspapers summed up an abbreviated life in four frozen frames. A child, captured by a series of closed-circuit security cameras, skips across a paved square then slows down as he enters a building. Next he is seen inside a lift, solemn and composed. An hour later the same child bled to death in a grimy stairwell, this time out of sight of the cameras.</p> <p>Those CCTV images have become Damilola Taylor's perfunctory memorial. Sad hindsight now finds puzzles and mysteries in them. In his silver jacket, which playfully copies an astronaut's uniform, he seems to be moonwalking through bleak Peckham. He leaps between decorative oblong blocks, bent sideways to maintain his balance. Children never just walk or plod or slouch or trudge like the rest of us. They have too much energy to get rid of, and because their vitality is infinite they feel no need to conserve it.</p> <p>Two minutes later, caught by the next camera, Damilola has set himself a geometrical test: he sprints in a straight line, keeping to a track marked on the pavement. Here again is the essence of childhood, which makes private maps and fills empty space with obstacles to be overcome. What invisible gauntlet did he think he was running?</p> <p>The last image, taken by the camera in the library lift, is the most unsettling. The space entombs him: the man with whom he shares this box holds a bundle of flowers. But Damilola is smiling. The exhilaration of his race through the streets has not yet drained from his body. And besides that, he has so much future to look forward to.</p> <p>From these four images, the papers constructed a short story, which ends in a trail of ellipses leading to that nearby stairwell: the Daily Mail called it 'Dammy's Final Hour', which The Mirror varied to 'Dami's Last Steps'.</p> <p>The omnipresence of security cameras like those in Peckham means a visual obituary can be pieced together for any of us. But whereas spoken tributes try to honour lives which have ended, the camera has a drier, colder eye and reveals the awkward, ignorant haste with which people rush towards death or disaster. Princess Diana, hustled through a revolving door at the Paris Ritz, thought she was speeding home to bed. Jill Dando, efficiently running errands in a Hammersmith shopping mall, had office supplies to buy. James Bulger, happily teamed up with two new friends, straggled off to play down by the railway line. Leanne Tiernan, shopping in Leeds two weeks ago, had Christmas presents to find: the CCTV cameras followed her some of the way but can't report on her present whereabouts.</p> <p>All these people were smiling, like Damilola, in the confident contemplation of un-numbered tomorrows. CCTV tells a harsher truth than most elegies. Lives don't end at some appointed moment; they just stop, abruptly and unexpectedly, as if a camera had suddenly run out of tape.</p> <p>The footage replays itself in a perpetual present, which is the blithe tense in which we all live. But if you look more closely the tempo has something eerie and unsettling about it. The cameras don't record motion; each time they blink they freeze an instant, and there's a gap before the next exposure, so that bodies look jittery, artificially animated from outside - not so much alive as undead. Their testimony is all the crueller because, after a death, images are no consolation. You can rerun the tapes but you can't reverse time and bring back the person you have lost.</p> <p>The images of Damilola are also a reminder of our accountability to technology, and of our blind trust in it. We are living inside a panopticon, inhabiting a prison of transparent walls, with guards ceaselessly invigilating the internees. Everything must be made visible. There are 150,000 CCTV cameras in London, a million elsewhere in the country, and their professional snooping is augmented by the efforts of amateurs. Camcorders in the delivery room make home movies of our bleeding, screeching entry into the world, and preserve on tape a trauma we have mercifully forgotten. When a disaster occurs there's always a witness with a camera to hand: remember the footage, taken from a passing lorry, of Concorde blazing as it crashed outside Paris last summer.</p> <p>We have become used to being perpetually on set, our every movement in a public place overseen from some secret control room. Is this the fulfilment of Andy Warhol's prophecy, which promised a few minutes of stardom for all?</p> <p>Not everyone is happy with this visual conscription. A while ago a man called Geoff Peck slashed his wrists in the street. He didn't intend his death to be a spectacle for passers-by; he was homeless and therefore had no private space to retire to, no door to close behind him. CCTV operators saw his suicide attempt, and sent the paramedics to save him. When Peck recovered he learned to his dismay that his anguish had been used to entertain the nation: the local authority which maintained the cameras had sold the tape, without consulting him, to the BBC and ITV.</p> <p>He was right to feel betrayed, abused, belittled. Though the omniscient cameras have become our memorialists, they lack the emotional qualifications for the job. Their view is negligently blurred since they can't discriminate between the indifferent blobs they photograph - until Damilola is outlined by a red circle, as if detained in a rifle sight. And their silence has an anaesthesia of its own, muffling any response.</p> <p>Charlie Chaplin once said that tragedy was life seen in close-up, whereas comedy represented the world in long shot. CCTV cameras need to keep watch on entire precincts so they prefer long shots, which make room for crowds; the singularity of the close-up is no part of their duty. Inside the lift, Damilola gets closer to the camera but he remains a background figure. The foreground is monopolised by the man with the bouquet, who must have a rendezvous ahead of him.</p> <p>Casually unfocused, blandly unable to tell the difference between a man on his way to meet his girlfriend and a boy on his way to be killed, this image is already a species of Pop Art, like those bright, glossy Warhol paintings of car crashes and executions in the electric chair which acknowledge misery and pain. To the distress of his family, James Bulger became one of Pop's short-lived celebrities after his death when the artist Jamie Wagg took newspaper reproductions of the CCTV tapes and made laminated prints from them, which he called 'cartoons for tapestry'. The pictures didn't bother to commemorate the child: Wagg simply entitled them 'Shopping Mall' and 'Railway Line'. In this he was true to the CCTV aesthetic since the cameras are concerned with places, not with the people in messy, fugitive transit through them. Their purpose is to protect property, not human life, and they are only interested in us if we happen to be vandals or shoplifters or derelicts whose blood, like Geoff Peck's, seems likely to be an insanitary nuisance.</p> <p>If you've ever glimpsed yourself on a monitor inside a shop door, you'll know how reductively ruthless CCTV is. Here you are in all your scruffy, grungy insignificance. The camera is egalitarian, as the Marquess of Blandford discovered in August when a security guard watching CCTV at Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge saw him pocket two pairs of sunglasses. The Marquess was found not guilty in court, but video evidence like this turns us inside out and exposes the pitiful banality of our misdeeds; the Marquess's alleged haul included a stick of deodorant.</p> <p>Jill Dando's shopping list on the last morning of her life was equally humdrum. CCTV showed her buying fax paper at Rymans and searching in Dixons for a blue ink cartridge, which she couldn't find. The tapes draw baleful attention to the short-term thinking we rely on to get through our lives. How important was the elusive cartridge, when seen by the eye of eternity?</p> <p>I remember once, as a child in Australia, thinking I might have been singled our for attention by that punitive eternal eye. I had misbehaved all afternoon. Now the sun was setting, and it looked like a bloodshot eye, burning a hole in the membrane of the sky. 'He's looking at you,' said my mother, meaning God. I thought about her threat, and after a while, when the glaring sun had disappeared, decided not to be afraid. How could the all-seeing supervisor be everywhere and see everything?</p> <p>Now I know better. God's ocular chores have been taken over by machines, which between them have a million eyes. Sleeplessly staring at us, they know what happens while we are asleep. In 1999 a railway engineer was convicted of indecently assaulting a woman on the station platform at Harrow and Wealdstone. It was CCTV that accused him; the woman, who had been at a St Patrick's Day revel, had no memory of the assault. 'I became hysterical,' she told the judge, 'when I saw the video.'</p> <p>Tapes, unlike human beings, have total recall. Student protesters in Chicago in 1968, defending themselves against Mayor Daley's thuggish police, chanted an appeal to the television cameras: 'The whole world is watching!' That faith in an impartial, objective jury of viewers seems sadly dated. Today the whole world is being watched - and by whom? Probably, if we recall the closed house where Big Brother took place, by Davina McCall. The God who judged our actions has been replaced, thanks to CCTV, by a sniggering, prurient goddess, delighted to catch us picking our noses, scratching our bums and stabbing our best friends in the back.</p> <p>The Royle Family caters to this paranoia: it suggests that, while the Royles think they are watching television, television actually watches them, thanks to a camera secreted in the cathode tube. An eye as disenchanted as that of CCTV shows them up in all their dreary squalor. In our cities the avoidance of eye contact is a crucial, cautious protocol. As Robert de Niro demonstrates in Taxi Driver - when talking to his reflection in the mirror - to catch someone else's eye is to ask for trouble. But though we don't look at each other any more, we are collectively under observation. CCTV represents all that's left of the communal sense.</p> <p>Cameras like these are supercilious. Because they look down on the world and its foreshortened populace, they confer power on whoever does the looking. What if they decide that they know how to foresee the future? At Bristol University computers are analysing video clips of criminals in order to develop software which will prompt CCTV cameras to predict assaults before they occur. Behaviour deemed to be suspicious is being minutely anatomised; the language of bodies about to pounce or start a fight is being systematically studied. The scientists writing software for Home Office computers assume that people are automata, pre-programmed and incorrigible. Therefore why not arrest malefactors before they do anything wrong?</p> <p>If the cameras are permitted to make such judgments they may, as the civil rights campaigner Simon Davies has warned, 'start penalising extreme or unusual behaviour, which leads to social exclusion'.</p> <p>The state usually justifies its incursions on our freedom and privacy by claiming we're being deprived of liberty for our own good. CCTV surveillance is meant to guarantee security. But will a society policed by cameras be utopian or totalitarian? The film director Wim Wenders speculates about compulsory visibility in The End of Violence, where Gabriel Byrne, as a scientist who once worked for Nasa, studies Los Angeles on a battery of video screens inside the Griffith Park Observatory. Satellites, like angels in orbit, can zoom in on traffic violators, muggers and jay-walkers; there will surely be no more violence in a city where everyone is on tape. At least that's what Byrne believes, until he realises - just before his employer has him killed - that the observer is being observed.</p> <p>In Philip Noyce's film Sliver, William Baldwin plays the owner of a New York skyscraper who oversees the lives of his tenants from his CCTV headquarters. His motives, he imagines, are benign; when the tape shows a man molesting his step-daughter, he issues a divinely disembodied warning over the telephone. 'We should wire the whole town,' he tells Sharon Stone. But his own merely human eyes are fickle, inattentive. He records a murder, but never gets round to viewing the tape which identifies the culprit. He prefers to replay footage of himself making sweaty love to Stone. Breaking into his electronic den, she demands that he hand over over her cassette. 'I want my privacy,' she says. 'I want my own experiences.' She regains this autonomy, with the aid of a gun, and shoots holes in Baldwin's bank of monitors.</p> <p>It's the kind of falsely conclusive victory which is only possible in a film. Cameras ensure that nothing is private, and nothing therefore is sacred. Last week David Attenborough added to television's armoury of intruders by introducing a cheeky gadget which he called Bouldercam - a camera camouflaged as a boulder, which needs no intrepid human operator. Left in place in the savannah, Bouldercam spied on two mating lions. The male lowered himself into place and did some thrusting while he bit the scruff of his partner's neck to hold her down; flies settled on the recumbent, snarling female, which might have bothered her if the whole brusque transaction had lasted more than a few seconds. As seen by this candid camera, the king of beasts was just one more shaggy, unkempt member of the Royle Family.</p> <p>If a God existed, he'd need an eye as multifaceted as a fly's in order to keep track of all those monitors which exhibit the destructive antics of his creation. And that is what those desolate images from Peckham suggest - the world as it might be viewed by a fly on the wall, which discerns no special providence in the fall of a sparrow or the death of a 10-year-old boy, seeing everything but understanding nothing.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last week the newspapers summed up an abbreviated life in four frozen frames. A child, captured by a series of closed-circuit security cameras, skips across a paved square then slows down as he enters a building. Next he is seen inside a lift, solemn and composed. An hour later the same child bled to death in a grimy stairwell, this time out of sight of the cameras. Those CCTV images have become Damilola Taylor's perfunctory memorial. Sad hindsight now finds puzzles and mysteries in them. In his silver jacket, which playfully copies an astronaut's uniform, he seems to be moonwalking through bleak Peckham. He leaps between decorative oblong blocks, bent sideways to maintain his balance. Children never just walk or plod or slouch or trudge like the rest of us. They have too much energy to get rid of, and because their vitality is infinite they feel no need to conserve it. Two minutes later, caught by the next camera, Damilola has set himself a geometrical test: he sprints in a straight line, keeping to a track marked on the pavement. Here again is the essence of childhood, which makes private maps and fills empty space with obstacles to be overcome. What invisible gauntlet did he think he was running? The last image, taken by the camera in the library lift, is the most unsettling. The space entombs him: the man with whom he shares this box holds a bundle of flowers. But Damilola is smiling. The exhilaration of his race through the streets has not yet drained from his body. And besides that, he has so much future to look forward to. From these four images, the papers constructed a short story, which ends in a trail of ellipses leading to that nearby stairwell: the Daily Mail called it 'Dammy's Final Hour', which The Mirror varied to 'Dami's Last Steps'. The omnipresence of security cameras like those in Peckham means a visual obituary can be pieced together for any of us. But whereas spoken tributes try to honour lives which have ended, the camera has a drier, colder eye and reveals the awkward, ignorant haste with which people rush towards death or disaster. Princess Diana, hustled through a revolving door at the Paris Ritz, thought she was speeding home to bed. Jill Dando, efficiently running errands in a Hammersmith shopping mall, had office supplies to buy. James Bulger, happily teamed up with two new friends, straggled off to play down by the railway line. Leanne Tiernan, shopping in Leeds two weeks ago, had Christmas presents to find: the CCTV cameras followed her some of the way but can't report on her present whereabouts. All these people were smiling, like Damilola, in the confident contemplation of un-numbered tomorrows. CCTV tells a harsher truth than most elegies. Lives don't end at some appointed moment; they just stop, abruptly and unexpectedly, as if a camera had suddenly run out of tape. The footage replays itself in a perpetual present, which is the blithe tense in which we all live. But if you look more closely the tempo has something eerie and unsettling about it. The cameras don't record motion; each time they blink they freeze an instant, and there's a gap before the next exposure, so that bodies look jittery, artificially animated from outside - not so much alive as undead. Their testimony is all the crueller because, after a death, images are no consolation. You can rerun the tapes but you can't reverse time and bring back the person you have lost. The images of Damilola are also a reminder of our accountability to technology, and of our blind trust in it. We are living inside a panopticon, inhabiting a prison of transparent walls, with guards ceaselessly invigilating the internees. Everything must be made visible. There are 150,000 CCTV cameras in London, a million elsewhere in the country, and their professional snooping is augmented by the efforts of amateurs. Camcorders in the delivery room make home movies of our bleeding, screeching entry into the world, and preserve on tape a trauma we have mercifully forgotten. When a disaster occurs there's always a witness with a camera to hand: remember the footage, taken from a passing lorry, of Concorde blazing as it crashed outside Paris last summer. We have become used to being perpetually on set, our every movement in a public place overseen from some secret control room. Is this the fulfilment of Andy Warhol's prophecy, which promised a few minutes of stardom for all? Not everyone is happy with this visual conscription. A while ago a man called Geoff Peck slashed his wrists in the street. He didn't intend his death to be a spectacle for passers-by; he was homeless and therefore had no private space to retire to, no door to close behind him. CCTV operators saw his suicide attempt, and sent the paramedics to save him. When Peck recovered he learned to his dismay that his anguish had been used to entertain the nation: the local authority which maintained the cameras had sold the tape, without consulting him, to the BBC and ITV. He was right to feel betrayed, abused, belittled. Though the omniscient cameras have become our memorialists, they lack the emotional qualifications for the job. Their view is negligently blurred since they can't discriminate between the indifferent blobs they photograph - until Damilola is outlined by a red circle, as if detained in a rifle sight. And their silence has an anaesthesia of its own, muffling any response. Charlie Chaplin once said that tragedy was life seen in close-up, whereas comedy represented the world in long shot. CCTV cameras need to keep watch on entire precincts so they prefer long shots, which make room for crowds; the singularity of the close-up is no part of their duty. Inside the lift, Damilola gets closer to the camera but he remains a background figure. The foreground is monopolised by the man with the bouquet, who must have a rendezvous ahead of him. Casually unfocused, blandly unable to tell the difference between a man on his way to meet his girlfriend and a boy on his way to be killed, this image is already a species of Pop Art, like those bright, glossy Warhol paintings of car crashes and executions in the electric chair which acknowledge misery and pain. To the distress of his family, James Bulger became one of Pop's short-lived celebrities after his death when the artist Jamie Wagg took newspaper reproductions of the CCTV tapes and made laminated prints from them, which he called 'cartoons for tapestry'. The pictures didn't bother to commemorate the child: Wagg simply entitled them 'Shopping Mall' and 'Railway Line'. In this he was true to the CCTV aesthetic since the cameras are concerned with places, not with the people in messy, fugitive transit through them. Their purpose is to protect property, not human life, and they are only interested in us if we happen to be vandals or shoplifters or derelicts whose blood, like Geoff Peck's, seems likely to be an insanitary nuisance. If you've ever glimpsed yourself on a monitor inside a shop door, you'll know how reductively ruthless CCTV is. Here you are in all your scruffy, grungy insignificance. The camera is egalitarian, as the Marquess of Blandford discovered in August when a security guard watching CCTV at Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge saw him pocket two pairs of sunglasses. The Marquess was found not guilty in court, but video evidence like this turns us inside out and exposes the pitiful banality of our misdeeds; the Marquess's alleged haul included a stick of deodorant. Jill Dando's shopping list on the last morning of her life was equally humdrum. CCTV showed her buying fax paper at Rymans and searching in Dixons for a blue ink cartridge, which she couldn't find. The tapes draw baleful attention to the short-term thinking we rely on to get through our lives. How important was the elusive cartridge, when seen by the eye of eternity? I remember once, as a child in Australia, thinking I might have been singled our for attention by that punitive eternal eye. I had misbehaved all afternoon. Now the sun was setting, and it looked like a bloodshot eye, burning a hole in the membrane of the sky. 'He's looking at you,' said my mother, meaning God. I thought about her threat, and after a while, when the glaring sun had disappeared, decided not to be afraid. How could the all-seeing supervisor be everywhere and see everything? Now I know better. God's ocular chores have been taken over by machines, which between them have a million eyes. Sleeplessly staring at us, they know what happens while we are asleep. In 1999 a railway engineer was convicted of indecently assaulting a woman on the station platform at Harrow and Wealdstone. It was CCTV that accused him; the woman, who had been at a St Patrick's Day revel, had no memory of the assault. 'I became hysterical,' she told the judge, 'when I saw the video.' Tapes, unlike human beings, have total recall. Student protesters in Chicago in 1968, defending themselves against Mayor Daley's thuggish police, chanted an appeal to the television cameras: 'The whole world is watching!' That faith in an impartial, objective jury of viewers seems sadly dated. Today the whole world is being watched - and by whom? Probably, if we recall the closed house where Big Brother took place, by Davina McCall. The God who judged our actions has been replaced, thanks to CCTV, by a sniggering, prurient goddess, delighted to catch us picking our noses, scratching our bums and stabbing our best friends in the back. The Royle Family caters to this paranoia: it suggests that, while the Royles think they are watching television, television actually watches them, thanks to a camera secreted in the cathode tube. An eye as disenchanted as that of CCTV shows them up in all their dreary squalor. In our cities the avoidance of eye contact is a crucial, cautious protocol.

      "bodyText": "Has the rise and spectacular fall of dotcom entrepreneurs changed Britain's attitude to bankrupts? Do we see them as spirited visionaries who are prepared to take risks? Or as a bunch of dodgy dealers who get what they deserve? The answer depends on who you ask. The Government, some entrepreneurs, and a few banks claim a shift in attitude is taking place. But what about those who have experienced bankruptcy? 'I don't think anything is different. It is still a taboo. It is still a stigma. It is still something to feel ashamed of and embarrassed by,' says James (not his real name). James ran a fashion business for five years. But it folded after he made 'a couple of mistakes' in a fickle, unforgiving trade. He managed to pay off the smaller traders, but was left with a \u00a33,000 VAT bill. He was made bankrupt for the standard three-year period. (You can be made bankrupt for owing as little as \u00a3750.) While serving his time James was an 'undischarged' bankrupt and as such faced several restrictions. He could not have a chequebook or a debit card. He could not, in fact, have any sort of credit whether with a tradesman, a utility service or a department store. 'I was reduced to a passport account. I felt like a 15-year-old again. It is was so humiliating and [it] made doing everyday normal things virtually impossible.' He could not work as a director, a manager or a company owner. He could not keep any wages. Living expenses were allowed but the rest went to the official receiver to pay off creditors - in this case the Inland Revenue. 'I was having to do some crappy job when I could have been out there again, doing something great. We were having to living hand to mouth.We still are.' A family man, James finished his bankruptcy period last year, was duly 'discharged' and is now employed at a wholesale firm. Looking back, he says: 'It felt like I was serving a civil imprisonment.

Those who are not confident of their ability to choose the right one in either camp could be as well in an indexed fund as an actively managed one.",

The proceeds of his mother's house, \u00a330,000, are locked away at his solicitor's because his mother's will said he could not receive it until he turned 30.

He realises that it is 'a bit rich' to suggest they have money problems: 'That is a lot of money, but it is not enough to allow my wife and me to pack it all in and move to Hawaii (something neither of us actually wants to do) but I am concerned that we are doing nothing at the moment to maximise our money's potential.' </p> <p>Tony earns \u00a317,000 a year, with another \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000 from freelance work.

      "byline": "Neasa MacErlean",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There are two ways of managing your money. You can give it a lot of your time, scout around for the best deals and regularly take your custom to places offering better rates and rewards. Or - like most of us - you probably find yourself too busy doing other things to spend time each month deal-hunting. My aim is to help both groups, but particularly inactive investors. For them, the first tip is that if you'll end up staying with the same mortgage lender or savings institution for years, pick a good one to start with. </p> <p>True, the deal-hunters should come out best in the long run. A new intensity of competition over the past five years means that the shrewdest mortgage borrowers will gain most by moving their loan every few years. </p> <p>But a financial couch potato can still prosper. Finding a lender that consistently charged 1 per cent less than most and sticking with it would save \u00a312,500 over the life of a \u00a3100,000 mortgage. Savers who choose badly could lose potential interest of between 5 and 6 per cent a year - worth perhaps \u00a3500 a year on a \u00a310,000 deposit. </p> <p>So how do you find the best institutions? And does your estimate of 'trustworthiness' matter? For a start, don't always put your faith in'best buy' tables. Players in all areas of personal finance deliberately structure their products to appear in the best buys. Researcher Moneyfacts calls this 'playing the chart'. The best are often not listed those listed as the best buys, but those consistently appearing near the top of the tables. </p> <p>Many are rather cavalier in the way they describe their products. E-loan, the website information provider on mortgages, classifies 26 loans as'flexible' - but says it has probably had twice that number of providers who claim they have flexible products. When these products have been scrutinised, however, they have not turned out to be different. </p> <p>The word 'ethical' is misused,too. Ethical investment plans have become extremely popular, but not because fund managers and product providers have seen the light: some are plain cynical and will call a product 'ethical' just to attract new groups of investors. </p> <p>Unfortunately, personal finance is too complicated a subject to allow easy answers. Which? magazine does good work researching consumer areas from holidays to gym membership to building contractors, yet it does not look at specific savings and mortgage products. 'The mortgage market changes so rapidly that we haven't been able to look at it,' says spokeswoman Kate Levine. </p> <p>So consumers can find themselves very confused when they try to differentiate between product providers. If you manage to keep out of the grasp of the bad ones, you have done half the job. Just as the devil is supposed to have the best tunes, so the bad providers and ruthless salespeople are expert at cynical marketing. </p> <p>The fact that more than a million people may have been wrongly advised to switch from employers' pension schemes into personal pension plans a decade ago shows how easy it is for marketing schmooze to prevail over cold, hard facts. </p> <p>But if you want to do the job properly, find a bank or building society you like and approve of. 'If you don't like your service provider, you should change it,' says Frank Eve, managing director of E-loan. If you find it too authoritarian, slow to answer your questions or obfuscating, these are all indications that it may not be right for you. </p> <p>The most important factor when choosing a product is the interest rate, according to research organisation Mintel.

      "bodyText": "There are two ways of managing your money. You can give it a lot of your time, scout around for the best deals and regularly take your custom to places offering better rates and rewards. Or - like most of us - you probably find yourself too busy doing other things to spend time each month deal-hunting. My aim is to help both groups, but particularly inactive investors. For them, the first tip is that if you'll end up staying with the same mortgage lender or savings institution for years, pick a good one to start with. True, the deal-hunters should come out best in the long run. A new intensity of competition over the past five years means that the shrewdest mortgage borrowers will gain most by moving their loan every few years. But a financial couch potato can still prosper. Finding a lender that consistently charged 1 per cent less than most and sticking with it would save \u00a312,500 over the life of a \u00a3100,000 mortgage. Savers who choose badly could lose potential interest of between 5 and 6 per cent a year - worth perhaps \u00a3500 a year on a \u00a310,000 deposit. So how do you find the best institutions? And does your estimate of 'trustworthiness' matter? For a start, don't always put your faith in'best buy' tables. Players in all areas of personal finance deliberately structure their products to appear in the best buys. Researcher Moneyfacts calls this 'playing the chart'. The best are often not listed those listed as the best buys, but those consistently appearing near the top of the tables. Many are rather cavalier in the way they describe their products. E-loan, the website information provider on mortgages, classifies 26 loans as'flexible' - but says it has probably had twice that number of providers who claim they have flexible products. When these products have been scrutinised, however, they have not turned out to be different. The word 'ethical' is misused,too. Ethical investment plans have become extremely popular, but not because fund managers and product providers have seen the light: some are plain cynical and will call a product 'ethical' just to attract new groups of investors. Unfortunately, personal finance is too complicated a subject to allow easy answers. Which? magazine does good work researching consumer areas from holidays to gym membership to building contractors, yet it does not look at specific savings and mortgage products. 'The mortgage market changes so rapidly that we haven't been able to look at it,' says spokeswoman Kate Levine. So consumers can find themselves very confused when they try to differentiate between product providers. If you manage to keep out of the grasp of the bad ones, you have done half the job. Just as the devil is supposed to have the best tunes, so the bad providers and ruthless salespeople are expert at cynical marketing. The fact that more than a million people may have been wrongly advised to switch from employers' pension schemes into personal pension plans a decade ago shows how easy it is for marketing schmooze to prevail over cold, hard facts. But if you want to do the job properly, find a bank or building society you like and approve of. 'If you don't like your service provider, you should change it,' says Frank Eve, managing director of E-loan. If you find it too authoritarian, slow to answer your questions or obfuscating, these are all indications that it may not be right for you. The most important factor when choosing a product is the interest rate, according to research organisation Mintel. But believing the institution to be 'trustworthy' is also important. This was cited as one of the two most important factors by 28 per cent of adults in Mintel's 'Deposit and Savings Account' research conducted this year. Nationwide, the UK's largest building society, is very clearly aiming to be trustworthy. Like many of the other societies fighting to retain mutual status, it is working hard to prove that it does give good service to its customer-owners. By and large, it does seem to avoid marketing gimmicks. Many of its products are genuinely and consistently competitive, even though they do not appear in the best buy tables each week.

The former was asked to grant an injunction to stop the count before it had even begun, and a 41-page brief to the Supreme Court pointed to 'serious constitutional errors' in the Florida court's decision.

Counts in other areas were complicated by logistical problems and an imposed deadline of 2pm today, but some, completed early, showed modest gains for Gore.</p> <p>Even the excitement of Democrats in the counting rooms was qualified by the knowledge that the Supreme Court could stop the count at any moment.</p> <p>Bush had accordingly submitted a 'supplemented memorandum' arguing that the situation 'powerfully demonstrated the need for a stay'.</p> <p>Justice Anthony Kennedy arrived at the Washington court to convene all nine judges - an unpredecented move on a weekend.</p> <p>The court itself is bitterly divided. Its rulings on major issues over the past two Presidential terms have invariably been settled 5-4, occasionally 6-3, with President Clinton's judges, Stephen Beyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, cancelling out ultra-conservatives Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who take a hard right-wing line (George Bush has praised both of them).</p> <p>But seven of the nine judges were appointed by Presidents Bush, Reagan, Ford and Nixon - and two moderate conservatives have held the balance. Yesterday they voted on partisan lines.</p> <p>The stay on the count was supported by Scalia, Thomas, Judge Anthony Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor - all appointed by Republican presidents - headed by the Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who has a long conservative track record.</p> <p>Gore's lawyers had urged the Supreme Court to allow the counting of votes while the court considered its juris diction over a formal appeal from Bush, due yesterday afternoon. Gore's lawyers said it was 'remarkable' for Bush to simply ask the court to stop the count.</p> <p>The court had one basic question before it: would it allow the vote to continue before Gore's time ran out, or not? Even if the court had granted Bush's appeal, the count would have continued and Gore's possible lead established before any hearing.</p> <p>The baffled counters dropped their ballots, which were put back in file boxes; the counting rooms were empty within minutes.</p> <p>Officials in the Gore campaign were almost speechless with bitterness. Spokesman Ron Klain said the counts were 'going well', with 13 counties finished. 'We were in a position for Vice President Gore and Senator Joe Lieberman to take the lead,' he said.</p> <p>Looking shattered, David Boies - the attorney whose victory on Friday had brought Gore to the brink of the presidency - said: 'The timing issue is the most disappointing thing about what the Supreme Court has done.

It asked the court to rule the recount unconstitutional and stop it. The formal appeal was due later yesterday afternoon, but was not necessary. The judges kept their silence, however, as the time drew near to commence counting at 8am. The count duly started of 9,000 votes cast in Miami, abandoned two weeks ago with a baying Republican mob kicking at the counting room door, and which the Gore camp was confident would see him overtake Bush's lead before the end of the day. Counts in other areas were complicated by logistical problems and an imposed deadline of 2pm today, but some, completed early, showed modest gains for Gore. Even the excitement of Democrats in the counting rooms was qualified by the knowledge that the Supreme Court could stop the count at any moment. Bush had accordingly submitted a 'supplemented memorandum' arguing that the situation 'powerfully demonstrated the need for a stay'. Justice Anthony Kennedy arrived at the Washington court to convene all nine judges - an unpredecented move on a weekend. The court itself is bitterly divided. Its rulings on major issues over the past two Presidential terms have invariably been settled 5-4, occasionally 6-3, with President Clinton's judges, Stephen Beyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, cancelling out ultra-conservatives Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who take a hard right-wing line (George Bush has praised both of them). But seven of the nine judges were appointed by Presidents Bush, Reagan, Ford and Nixon - and two moderate conservatives have held the balance. Yesterday they voted on partisan lines. The stay on the count was supported by Scalia, Thomas, Judge Anthony Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor - all appointed by Republican presidents - headed by the Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who has a long conservative track record. Gore's lawyers had urged the Supreme Court to allow the counting of votes while the court considered its juris diction over a formal appeal from Bush, due yesterday afternoon. Gore's lawyers said it was 'remarkable' for Bush to simply ask the court to stop the count. The court had one basic question before it: would it allow the vote to continue before Gore's time ran out, or not? Even if the court had granted Bush's appeal, the count would have continued and Gore's possible lead established before any hearing. The baffled counters dropped their ballots, which were put back in file boxes; the counting rooms were empty within minutes. Officials in the Gore campaign were almost speechless with bitterness. Spokesman Ron Klain said the counts were 'going well', with 13 counties finished. 'We were in a position for Vice President Gore and Senator Joe Lieberman to take the lead,' he said. Looking shattered, David Boies - the attorney whose victory on Friday had brought Gore to the brink of the presidency - said: 'The timing issue is the most disappointing thing about what the Supreme Court has done. It makes it much more difficult to get the count completed even if the count gets the go-ahead'.

      "bodyText": "The Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak flummoxed the nation yesterday when he announced he would resign today and push for re-election to the prime ministership in 60 days to seek a fresh mandate to tackle what he called the country's emergency situation. \"There are those who doubt the mandate I received from the citizens of Israel\", Mr Barak said in a televised address to the nation. \"Tomorrow I will advise the president of my resignation (and) in 60 days we will go to special elections for prime minister.\" He said he made his decision in consultation with his family over Friday night dinner, and took it to prevent Israel from contending full general elections for both the prime ministership and the parliament at a time when the country's security was so fragile. \"Due to the emergency situation the country is in... and the need to continue reducing the violence and moving forward the chances of peace negotiations, I have decided to ask again for the trust of the people of Israel,\" said Barak at a hastily convened news conference at his Jerusalem office. \"Tomorrow morning I will officially inform the president of my decision to resign and to stand in special elections as the head of the Labour Party for prime minister of Israel.\" Israeli law prevents parliament from dissolving itself, and Mr Barak's opponents for a prime ministerial vote must be sitting assembly members. A beleagured Barak will therefore avoid competing against former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opinion polls suggest would win an election. \"I, as prime minister, who was elected by a large majority, intend to ask the nation's permission to continue the path that we started on in the secure belief this is the right and true and only way for the state of Israel,\" Mr Barak said. Explaining his decision to call a special election for his position and not hold a general election, he said: \"I see no need to drag the country into unnecessary elections.\" He added that if parliament now chose to dissolve itself, then a suitable date would be found for prime ministerial and parliamentary elections. The cunning move for special elections for prime minister would reduce the chance that Mr Barak would be challenged for his party's leadership. He would likely stand against right-wing Likud leader Mr Ariel Sharon for the prime minister's post. The tormented Israeli leader has come under attack for his handling of a Palestinian uprising that broke out in the vacuum left by deadlocked peace talks. It had been speculated in the past that Mr Barak would use this time to make a major efforts to reach some sort of an agreement with the Palestinians before an election, and polls suggest that without such an achievement, his chances of re-election would be extremely slim. The Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Ahmed Qrei, said that it could be difficult to conclude a deal under such a tight timetable. \"I don't think there is any possibility to reach a peace agreement within this period,\" Qrei said. He added that the coming 60 days would appear to be a \"time out\" from the peace process. Mr Barak told a press gathering in Jerusalem that he would continue to seek ways to restart talks with the Palestinians but that he could not promise anything. Popular support for Mr Barak has taken a nosedive in the two months since fighting broke out. The vast majority of some 300 people killed have been Palestinian, but Israelis' sense of security has been battered and bruised, and many have lost faith in the peace process. A poll in the Hebrew daily, Maariv, indicated that Mr Netanyahu is ahead of Mr Barak by 45 to 27 percent, suggesting that half of Mr Barak's voters in the last election have now deserted him. Mr Barak's move is widely viewed as an effort to ensure that he runs against the opposition Likud leader Mr Sharon and not Mr Netanyahu, who resigned from politics upon his election defeat. When a prime minister resigns, triggering elections for prime minister but not for parliament, Israeli law requires any candidate to be members of parliament. A Likud member close to Mr Netanyahu said that he expected the prime minister to honour his commitment to change the law to enable Mr Netanyahu to run. Mr Danny Naveh insisted that in any case, \"any Likud leader will defeat the prime minister of Israel, and we will revert Israel to what we all hope will be a road of peace with security.\"",

Enough...you know her. You might well be her. </p> <p>And there's no real point in sneering, for this woman is one of the most potent forces in society today. Ever wondered just who buys all those Tube advertised Bridget Jones chick-lit rip-offs in their millions? Who it was that kept the trillions rolling in for Body Shop and Phil Collins and Tesco Metro and Friends and Louis de Berni\u00e9res and Hello! magazine? It was Everywoman. It was Shelaine Green. </p> <p>I'd wanted to meet Shelaine after reading last week that she paid over \u00a36,000 to have her name used as a character in the next novel by Kathy Lette. Hers was the highest bid in an auction in aid of the Medical Foundation for the Victims of Torture, in which authors such as Kathy and Nick Hornby agreed to use the bidder's name in their next works; so Kathy's fans will next year meet a character called Shelaine Green who will be feisty, sassy and other ballsy girl-traits. But I'd wanted to meet the real one because I suspected there might be an important circular irony here, in that the Everywoman Kathy and others have been selling to for years was now about to star in a book designed exactly for her. I suspected that in Shelaine I might find some answers: who, really, was Everywoman, and how would the reality of the book-buying woman collide with the fiction of the female character she would become? I couldn't have been more right in my prejudices; and I couldn't, of course, have been more wrong. </p> <p>Shelaine is almost unbearably pleasant. Trying to argue with her is like having a soft pillow-fight with the goddess of benignity, and she refuses to take offence at anything I say, even when trashing her chosen profession of marketing. She was born in Guernsey, 'a lovely place to grow up, safe and prosperous, and wonderful beaches.' This has bequeathed to her the odd accent of the island which leads many to think she's Australian: a fast throaty giggle and ready smile add to the impression. She left, however, as it was growing too stifling. She went, at 18, to Bath, to read chemistry - 'I'd loved all the bangs and smells at school. But research chemistry was a little duller than that. So I looked around for something that would keep me using my brain, and that's how I went into marketing. Friends who did it said they were really busy, and it was all common-sense stuff.' </p> <p>So she lived with two other girls in a flat in Olympia. 'We used to call ourselves the blonde, the brunette and the mousy-brown. Guess which I was! That was how we did our invitations _ we had great fun, great parties.' Later, she won a Cosmopolitan competition to spend a year at INSEAD, the French business school, and recalls it as her 'wildest year: you should have seen us, crazy, walking through the airport with our little badges on saying \"Cosmo high fliers\". It was a good year.' </p> <p>Now she lives with her long-term boyfriend - usually, anyway: he's away doing an MBA of his own - in a large, light penthouse flat off Ladbroke Grove. She's just spent three months travelling round South America (the mandatory Nepal trip was in 1991), and she adores her job, working freelance from home and proving rather successful at it (although her ability to bid at the auction was helped by a 'bit of an inheritance' earlier this year). She's always looking for 'fresh challenges', she says, and if bored she gets on the phone to one of her girlfriends for a 'good gossip'. She's 'not big on opera or ballet, but I like gentle classical, to switch off. A lot of my entertainment's like that. I read Hello! and watch Neighbours , and buy these switch-off books, because work's intense enough - life is intense enough.' She is 'not drastically political. I'm one of those people who tries to sort out their immediate environment - work, friends, family - rather than saving the world.' </p> <p>So far, so predictable. But then there are the subtleties, and the self-knowledge. She talks, when pressed, of difficulties. 'I've had my share of bad relationships. And my parents split up when I was 10, which was bad. But,' - she perks up again, as ever - 'it worked out for the best. They're very happy. </p> <p>'Generally, I've been lucky. I like my life. Would I change anything? I would have loved to be an actress but I was never that good, and also I used to do quite well in my exams and stuff. Maybe life can fall too sweetly for you sometimes. It's the only thing I wish I'd done. It's great to play somebody who's not like you. Maybe that's why I liked this idea of being a character for Kathy. I'm no good at put-down one-liners. I can't crack jokes, I'm not outrageous. So it's a chance to be completely different. There are so many things that hold you back in life, you're too polite, but as a Kathy Lette character you can say what you damn well please.' </p> <p>But would she actually like to be one of these people. 'No. I don't really think they exist, do you?' </p> <p>She's self-knowing, and wisely happy with it, although she surprises herself slightly when asked about wanting children. 'Pass. I feel I'll sort of be ready by about 50, which is biologically too late. It's never been a burning burning desire for me; I tend to take care of everybody else.' </p> <p>Shelaine has been utterly without guile and absurdly likeable throughout. She is Everywoman, no doubt: easy to predict en masse , but subtly individual, differently likeable, in real life. One could cavil at the belief that political interaction is just for those who 'want to save the world', or at swapping a career doing and discovering things for one simply selling things, but you also have to wonder how many of us easy pontificators would instantly look for a charity on which to spend a little inheritance. </p> <p>Lette wouldn't be able to make a character out of the real Shelaine, which is the whole point. But I do hope she does her justice.</p>",

I'd wanted to meet Shelaine after reading last week that she paid over \u00a36,000 to have her name used as a character in the next novel by Kathy Lette. Hers was the highest bid in an auction in aid of the Medical Foundation for the Victims of Torture, in which authors such as Kathy and Nick Hornby agreed to use the bidder's name in their next works; so Kathy's fans will next year meet a character called Shelaine Green who will be feisty, sassy and other ballsy girl-traits. But I'd wanted to meet the real one because I suspected there might be an important circular irony here, in that the Everywoman Kathy and others have been selling to for years was now about to star in a book designed exactly for her. I suspected that in Shelaine I might find some answers: who, really, was Everywoman, and how would the reality of the book-buying woman collide with the fiction of the female character she would become? I couldn't have been more right in my prejudices; and I couldn't, of course, have been more wrong. Shelaine is almost unbearably pleasant. Trying to argue with her is like having a soft pillow-fight with the goddess of benignity, and she refuses to take offence at anything I say, even when trashing her chosen profession of marketing. She was born in Guernsey, 'a lovely place to grow up, safe and prosperous, and wonderful beaches.' This has bequeathed to her the odd accent of the island which leads many to think she's Australian: a fast throaty giggle and ready smile add to the impression. She left, however, as it was growing too stifling. She went, at 18, to Bath, to read chemistry - 'I'd loved all the bangs and smells at school. But research chemistry was a little duller than that. So I looked around for something that would keep me using my brain, and that's how I went into marketing. Friends who did it said they were really busy, and it was all common-sense stuff.' So she lived with two other girls in a flat in Olympia. 'We used to call ourselves the blonde, the brunette and the mousy-brown. Guess which I was! That was how we did our invitations _ we had great fun, great parties.' Later, she won a Cosmopolitan competition to spend a year at INSEAD, the French business school, and recalls it as her 'wildest year: you should have seen us, crazy, walking through the airport with our little badges on saying \"Cosmo high fliers\". It was a good year.' Now she lives with her long-term boyfriend - usually, anyway: he's away doing an MBA of his own - in a large, light penthouse flat off Ladbroke Grove. She's just spent three months travelling round South America (the mandatory Nepal trip was in 1991), and she adores her job, working freelance from home and proving rather successful at it (although her ability to bid at the auction was helped by a 'bit of an inheritance' earlier this year). She's always looking for 'fresh challenges', she says, and if bored she gets on the phone to one of her girlfriends for a 'good gossip'. She's 'not big on opera or ballet, but I like gentle classical, to switch off. A lot of my entertainment's like that. I read Hello! and watch Neighbours , and buy these switch-off books, because work's intense enough - life is intense enough.' She is 'not drastically political. I'm one of those people who tries to sort out their immediate environment - work, friends, family - rather than saving the world.' So far, so predictable. But then there are the subtleties, and the self-knowledge. She talks, when pressed, of difficulties. 'I've had my share of bad relationships. And my parents split up when I was 10, which was bad. But,' - she perks up again, as ever - 'it worked out for the best. They're very happy. 'Generally, I've been lucky. I like my life. Would I change anything? I would have loved to be an actress but I was never that good, and also I used to do quite well in my exams and stuff. Maybe life can fall too sweetly for you sometimes. It's the only thing I wish I'd done. It's great to play somebody who's not like you. Maybe that's why I liked this idea of being a character for Kathy. I'm no good at put-down one-liners. I can't crack jokes, I'm not outrageous. So it's a chance to be completely different. There are so many things that hold you back in life, you're too polite, but as a Kathy Lette character you can say what you damn well please.' But would she actually like to be one of these people. 'No. I don't really think they exist, do you?' She's self-knowing, and wisely happy with it, although she surprises herself slightly when asked about wanting children. 'Pass. I feel I'll sort of be ready by about 50, which is biologically too late. It's never been a burning burning desire for me; I tend to take care of everybody else.' Shelaine has been utterly without guile and absurdly likeable throughout. She is Everywoman, no doubt: easy to predict en masse , but subtly individual, differently likeable, in real life. One could cavil at the belief that political interaction is just for those who 'want to save the world', or at swapping a career doing and discovering things for one simply selling things, but you also have to wonder how many of us easy pontificators would instantly look for a charity on which to spend a little inheritance. Lette wouldn't be able to make a character out of the real Shelaine, which is the whole point. But I do hope she does her justice.",

There is plenty of detail about daily life in a rapidly transforming city and country, but Grass's real obsession is with registering ripples of correspondence, many of them faint and all of them obscure to an international readership, across two centuries of German history. </p> <p>The hero of the novel is Theo Wuttke, a 70-year-old who once wore the blue of the Luftwaffe uniform. In East Germany during the Cold War, he lectured on cultural subjects and managed to ruffle the feathers of the regime, however untopical the title of his presentation might seem to be. He has long since renounced controversy but can't shake off his 'day-and-night shadow', the security agent Ludwig Hoftaller, who still knows any number of exploitable secrets, whether about Wuttke's wartime dalliances in France or the questionable loyalties of his estranged sons living in the West.</p> <p>Grass's cover illustration shows a crowd of tall Wuttkes and stumpy Hoftallers in conversation, and at various points in the book he seeks to impose them on the reader, usually by the same conceit of multiplication, as an iconic couple, if not Laurel and Hardy then Quixote and Sancho Panza. </p> <p>It is Wuttke's quixoticism to regard himself as the reincarnation of 'the Immortal', a writer and political commentator born in the same town (Neuruppin) on the same day (30 December), albeit 100 years earlier (in 1819 rather than 1919). His conversation skips back and forth between the centuries, in a way that his intimates now take for granted. Hoftaller is well used to being addressed as 'Tallhover', his nineteenth-century equivalent, the agent who kept tabs on the Immortal. The Immortal is never named in full, but his books are given their titles, and Wuttke is nicknamed 'Fonty', so it isn't hard to identify 'T.F.' as Theodor Fontane. </p> <p>Part of the attraction of Fontane for Grass (born 1927) may be that the work for which he is best remembered is 'an old man's late harvest' (Effi Briest appeared in 1895). In any case, Fontane's varied output of essays, war journalism, poems and fiction offers rich pickings for a twentieth-century writer who seeks, like Wuttke's favourite remembered schoolteacher, 'to eliminate the meaningless separation between the subjects of history and German by incorporating historical quotations into the latter and literary evidence into the former'. </p> <p>It's true that Effi Briest has achieved classic status, as a novel of adultery fit to share a shelf with Madame Bovary and Anna Karenina (Grass has tracked down a suitably lugubrious homage in Krapp's Last Tape: 'Scalded the eyes out of me reading Effi again, a page a day, with tears again'), but the details of his life and work are somewhat out of the way. Too Far Afield (the title is taken, without apparent irony, from Effi Briest) provides nothing in the way of exposition, just incessant allusion. The effect is to burden the modest flow of the story with cryptic references, to the point of inducing thromboses and aneurysms of narrative. </p> <p>When Wuttke's unknown granddaughter, whose mother was the product of a liaison in wartime France, shows up in Berlin, some breaking up of sclerotic literary deposits might be hoped for, some clearing of drains. But she too is an enthusiast of the writer she calls 'Monsieur X', to the point of having written a paper on the role played in his works by Newfoundland dogs. </p> <p>The habit of withholding names is extended to history and politics as well as literature. Any reader who doesn't immediately recognise 'the Sulfur-Yellow Collar' as Bismarck will have to be patient indeed, since the identification is spelled out only on page 524. And as for 'the Saxon Goatee'...</p> <p>Grass does come up with one grand image, free of allusive encrustation, for the repetitiveness, almost the repetition-compulsion, of German history: the old-fashioned lift, of the sort known as a paternoster, in the Ministries building where Wuttke works half days as a file courier, its chain of cabins open at the front and continuously moving, passing turning points in the cellar and the attic. It was while riding the paternoster that Wuttke met his wife in the 1930s, when the building housed Goering's Air Ministry, and the antiquated mechanism is still functional when the Handover Trust moves in to facilitate unification, that velvety Anschluss. </p> <p>Alongside the political pessimism of Too Far Afield is an incongruously pure faith in high culture. When, in a branch of McDonald's, Fonty recites all 23 stanzas of a ballad of Fontane's on a Scottish theme, he is applauded rather than moved on. His clandestine anti-Nazi broadcasts in France were highly effective, even though he was largely reading from Fontane's memoirs of the Franco-Prussian war: he 'had the impact of a bomb every time they broadcast him. Just look at the statistics on defectors round Lyon'.</p> <p>Even after unification, a lecture of Fonty's on literary themes electrifies a mixed audience into shouting the names of their favourite Fontane characters ('Where's Alonzo Giesh\u00fcbler, the noble apothecary?'). If the repetitiveness of history, the sense that 'in Germany nothing ever changes', as Fonty puts it, is a source of anguish, the continuity of German culture seems, for Grass at least, to be a potent consolation. But how can it be, when history and German are the same subject? If literature has no separate status, then it must suffer a cancellation of immunity. </p> <p>But the problem with Too Far Afield, from most readers' point of view, is more likely to be textural than philosophical. Fontane defended his old-fashioned preference for chapter headings on the basis that he favoured resting places, not only in art but in life: 'I have no use for parks without benches.' Grass has admittedly provided chapter headings for his combination of memorial garden and public park.

As Alfred North Whitehead famously put it, the whole of our Western philosophy is a footnote to Plato. </p> <p>As befits an executive editor of the Economist, Gottlieb rises to Aristotle. It is Aristotle's truly awesome range, toughness of intellect and systematic powers which engage Gottlieb's enthusiasm. Here 'the dreams of reason' are dreamt and acted upon in daylight. Works which encompass physics and semiotics, comparative anatomy and formal logic, poetics and politics, theology and meteorology, were to determine the agenda of Western philosophic and scientific inquiry for more than 1,000 years. Via Latin translation (and thanks to Cicero), concepts such as 'potential', 'dynamics', 'energy', 'substance', 'quality', 'essence', 'category' and many others continue to articulate our questions to the world. Even 'Mrs Aristotle' finds her chastened place in Gottlieb's lively perspective. </p> <p>A useful look at the Epicurean, Stoic and Sceptic sages who follow on Plato and Aristotle takes the narrative to St Augustine. It is both refreshing and absolutely legitimate to find Augustine considered as a major philosophic player. A fair measure of our readings of consciousness and self-consciousness derive from Augustine's formidable strengths and candours of introspection. Very possibly, we would have had neither Montaigne, nor Rousseau nor, it may well be, Freud without Augustine's precedent. Augustinian analyses of free will and determinism remain fresh. As do his meditations, in so many ways unsurpassed, on the nature of time (here also, omission of any reference to Heidegger detracts). </p> <p>By the time of Augustine's death in AD 430, the foundations of philosophy, of psychology, of political theory, of logic and inquiry into the nature of language in the West had been laid. Gottlieb's breathless account of medieval scholasticism and renaissance Neo-Platonism is, intentionally no doubt, an epilogue. The great subversions of Bacon and of Descartes lie on the horizon. </p> <p>The virtues of this compendium are manifest. It is written with brisk humour. Lewis Carroll turns up next to Parmenides; Flann O' Brien helps illuminate Hesiod; Umberto Eco hovers in the Aristotelian wings. The skills of a senior journalist and expositor inform even opaque and controversial issues. The 'common reader' owes gratitude to Gottlieb's avocation. But it is these same virtues which entail an underlying drawback. Only very rarely does this cool, often amused chronicle provide its readers with any intimation of the strangeness, the almost physical obduracy, the solitude of 'doing philosophy'. It is not in these smiling pages that we will experience the brain-numbing tensions which generate a theorem in formal logic. Gottlieb's enviable good sense skates lightly over much that is dark.</p>",

It is Aristotle's truly awesome range, toughness of intellect and systematic powers which engage Gottlieb's enthusiasm. Here 'the dreams of reason' are dreamt and acted upon in daylight. Works which encompass physics and semiotics, comparative anatomy and formal logic, poetics and politics, theology and meteorology, were to determine the agenda of Western philosophic and scientific inquiry for more than 1,000 years. Via Latin translation (and thanks to Cicero), concepts such as 'potential', 'dynamics', 'energy', 'substance', 'quality', 'essence', 'category' and many others continue to articulate our questions to the world. Even 'Mrs Aristotle' finds her chastened place in Gottlieb's lively perspective. A useful look at the Epicurean, Stoic and Sceptic sages who follow on Plato and Aristotle takes the narrative to St Augustine. It is both refreshing and absolutely legitimate to find Augustine considered as a major philosophic player. A fair measure of our readings of consciousness and self-consciousness derive from Augustine's formidable strengths and candours of introspection. Very possibly, we would have had neither Montaigne, nor Rousseau nor, it may well be, Freud without Augustine's precedent. Augustinian analyses of free will and determinism remain fresh. As do his meditations, in so many ways unsurpassed, on the nature of time (here also, omission of any reference to Heidegger detracts). By the time of Augustine's death in AD 430, the foundations of philosophy, of psychology, of political theory, of logic and inquiry into the nature of language in the West had been laid. Gottlieb's breathless account of medieval scholasticism and renaissance Neo-Platonism is, intentionally no doubt, an epilogue. The great subversions of Bacon and of Descartes lie on the horizon. The virtues of this compendium are manifest. It is written with brisk humour. Lewis Carroll turns up next to Parmenides; Flann O' Brien helps illuminate Hesiod; Umberto Eco hovers in the Aristotelian wings. The skills of a senior journalist and expositor inform even opaque and controversial issues. The 'common reader' owes gratitude to Gottlieb's avocation. But it is these same virtues which entail an underlying drawback. Only very rarely does this cool, often amused chronicle provide its readers with any intimation of the strangeness, the almost physical obduracy, the solitude of 'doing philosophy'. It is not in these smiling pages that we will experience the brain-numbing tensions which generate a theorem in formal logic. Gottlieb's enviable good sense skates lightly over much that is dark.",

He apologised for his typing, but assured the colonel that, 'I am one of the best writers currently using the English language as both a musical instrument and a political weapon.' It was sweetly naive of him to imagine that military despots value such credentials; nevertheless, his self-assessment was just.

His best known work (' To His Coy Mistress', 1646) is by turns grisly, profound and in its sexual candour, the work of a first class 'satyrist' in the truest sense. </p> <p>Its imagery was appropriated by Eliot and overshadows even Shelley. For the first time,though, Marvell the politician is predominant, making this biography invaluable to historians of the Civil War and Restoration. Murray acknowledges that most biographical details are as unverifiable as those pertaining to Shakespeare. But in an effort to avoid the fanaticism that has plagued Shakespearean criticism (Was he (Marvell) gay? He was a spy!), he only tentatively discusses what might have happened, without really conveying what it might have been like. Rather dispassionate then, but well-written and intelligently so. </p> <p> <strong> Eating Naked (Stories)</strong> <br>Stephen Dobyns<br>Penguin \u00a37.99, pp276<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000347958,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Characters are crushed by pigs, molested with carrots, and take dining al fresco very (un)seriously. But the common denominator is that, having fallen out of love, most are able to fall back in love with life again.

His best known work (' To His Coy Mistress', 1646) is by turns grisly, profound and in its sexual candour, the work of a first class 'satyrist' in the truest sense. Its imagery was appropriated by Eliot and overshadows even Shelley. For the first time,though, Marvell the politician is predominant, making this biography invaluable to historians of the Civil War and Restoration. Murray acknowledges that most biographical details are as unverifiable as those pertaining to Shakespeare. But in an effort to avoid the fanaticism that has plagued Shakespearean criticism (Was he (Marvell) gay? He was a spy!), he only tentatively discusses what might have happened, without really conveying what it might have been like. Rather dispassionate then, but well-written and intelligently so. Eating Naked (Stories) Stephen Dobyns Penguin \u00a37.99, pp276 Buy it at BOL Characters are crushed by pigs, molested with carrots, and take dining al fresco very (un)seriously. But the common denominator is that, having fallen out of love, most are able to fall back in love with life again. Of these 16 (progressively darker) stories, not one is a dud. Dobyns's moral is that getting the girl/boy is often less important than getting the joke.

      "body": "<p><strong> Index on Censorship: The Last Laugh</strong><br>\u00a38.99, pp193 </p> <p>You might be forgiven for thinking that comedy has lost its potential to subvert in Britain. Comedians who once lampooned Thatcher are selling out to the Murdoch networks or shackling themselves to Tory peers. A self-congratulating government hires comedy writers to pen its speeches, and, if the great Tom Lehrer had not pronounced satire dead when Kissinger won the Nobel Peace Prize, someone else would have had to in the wake of the current presidential fiasco. </p> <p>Elsewhere, comedy is still a potent weapon, as the current issue of Index on Censorship demonstrates. If you're Colombian or Palestinian, satirising the wrong people can get you shot, as the respective pieces here by Fabio Castillo and Mark Nesbit explain. </p> <p>Psychoanalyst Adam Phillips suggests, in his interview with Index editor Ursula Owen, that 'humour is the last thing before violence. It would be optimistic to say that all you've got to do is laugh and the regime comes tumbling down, but it would be equally na\u00efve to assume that humour has no power'. </p> <p>Two of the most interesting essays here are about a more insidious form of censorship, perpetrated in the name of political correctness. US comic Bill Hicks became the first comedian to be censored on the David Letterman show, for a few relatively innocent digs at Christians, pro-Lifers and lesbians. Hicks discovered that CBS was screening pro-Life commercials in the breaks during the Letterman Show. New Yorker journalist John Lahr picked up his story and exposed it.</p> <p>The second piece is by US comic Scott Capurro, whose Edinburgh show this year had audience members walking out in disgust at his very near-the-knuckle Holocaust material. This bears out an earlier assertion that the point, if not the explanation of humour is that nothing, and no one, is sacred.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Index on Censorship: The Last Laugh \u00a38.99, pp193 You might be forgiven for thinking that comedy has lost its potential to subvert in Britain. Comedians who once lampooned Thatcher are selling out to the Murdoch networks or shackling themselves to Tory peers. A self-congratulating government hires comedy writers to pen its speeches, and, if the great Tom Lehrer had not pronounced satire dead when Kissinger won the Nobel Peace Prize, someone else would have had to in the wake of the current presidential fiasco. Elsewhere, comedy is still a potent weapon, as the current issue of Index on Censorship demonstrates. If you're Colombian or Palestinian, satirising the wrong people can get you shot, as the respective pieces here by Fabio Castillo and Mark Nesbit explain. Psychoanalyst Adam Phillips suggests, in his interview with Index editor Ursula Owen, that 'humour is the last thing before violence. It would be optimistic to say that all you've got to do is laugh and the regime comes tumbling down, but it would be equally na\u00efve to assume that humour has no power'. Two of the most interesting essays here are about a more insidious form of censorship, perpetrated in the name of political correctness. US comic Bill Hicks became the first comedian to be censored on the David Letterman show, for a few relatively innocent digs at Christians, pro-Lifers and lesbians. Hicks discovered that CBS was screening pro-Life commercials in the breaks during the Letterman Show. New Yorker journalist John Lahr picked up his story and exposed it. The second piece is by US comic Scott Capurro, whose Edinburgh show this year had audience members walking out in disgust at his very near-the-knuckle Holocaust material. This bears out an earlier assertion that the point, if not the explanation of humour is that nothing, and no one, is sacred.",

By night, however, the tables turn nightmarishly: now at the furnace's mercy, Roussel is forced to conjure up discordant images and write interminable works which no one understands - 'Complaining that no one realises/The infinite is in my least verse'. Only in the final eight quatrains is order restored: by prodigious work, the poet reasserts control over his imagination, flames flare up as a fresh shift of workers produces verses and 'At this explosion deriving/From my universal genius/I see the world bow/ Before this name: Raymond Roussel.' </p> <p>What is extraordinary about this poem is how uncannily it predicted Roussel's career and life, in all but one crucial respect. Two years after it was written, 'Mon \u00e2me' became a sober description of his mental state. For six months he was gripped by 'an extraordinarily intense sensation of universal glory' as, barely sleeping or eating, he wrote a 5,600-line poem. This period featured in a study of displaced forms of religious mania written by his psychologist, Pierre Janet. 'Whatever I wrote was surrounded by rays of light; I used to close the curtains, for I was afraid the shining rays emanating from my pen might escape into the outside world through even the smallest chink'. There could be no doubt that this poem would secure him the fame of his heroes Jules Verne, Victor Hugo and Pierre Loti. </p> <p>Strikingly enough, 'La Doublure', the poem in question, is, as Mark Ford says, a story of mundane disappointment and obscurity which gives no sign of having been written with 'a thousand flaming pen nibs'. The understudy of the title fails on stage and in love, and two-thirds of the poem is given over to minutely detailed descriptions of the revellers at Nice Carnival. It received two reviews - 'more or less unintelligible', 'very boring'. Roussel collapsed. </p> <p>His night of the soul lasted 10 years. He wrote interminable poems - the 20,000-line, unfinished 'Les Noces', for instance, page after page describing soap bubbles blown by a child on a caf\u00e9 terrace - as he struggled to discover the compositional method, proc\u00e9d\u00e9, which would allow him to recover la gloire.</p> <p>Essentially based on puns, the proc\u00e9d\u00e9 is a way of playing with language to make it generate his increasingly fairytale works. He would break down a random sentence - 'Napoleon premier empereur', for instance - into assonantally related words. The result - nappe oll\u00e9 ombre miettes (tablecloth, ol\u00e9, shadow, crumbs) - would give him the image of castanet-clicking flamenco dancers on a heavily leaden table. With his love of illusion, he cast this as a tableau wrought by a sculptor capable of shaping water into momentary reliefs. Et voil\u00e0. A liquid drawing so detailed one can discern the shadows cast by the breadcrumbs on the tablecloth.</p> <p>Or he would take two almost identical sentences, in which each word has two, unrelated meanings, and extract the beginning of a story - a cryptogram on a billiard table in a country house - and its end - a group of Europeans held hostage in an African kingdom. All that was left was to write it. </p> <p>By 30, feeling he had achieved the required 'sensations of art', he embarked on the novel Impressions d'Afrique. This reveals an extraordinary world which he elaborated for the rest of his life, suspended, as Cocteau said, 'from elegance, fairyland and fear' and full of inventors, virtuosi and miraculous inventions. A worm, for instance, in a trough full of a strange water as heavy as mercury with a narrow slit in its base, suspended above a zither. Trained by a Hungarian musician, the worm arches its body to regulate the flow of drops on to the zither and thus plays wondrously complex rhapsodies and waltzes with 'a savagely dramatic range of expression'. Entering his flood of stories is, as Andr\u00e9 Gide said, like being swept up in a Gulf Stream of the imagination. </p> <p>What 'Mon \u00e2me' failed to see, however, is to whom such an experience would appeal. Roussel couldn't stand psychology and since his works start and end with language, they have a uniquely strange, distant quality, like 'a complicated set of tools whose use cannot be discovered', as John Ashbery puts it. Yet still Roussel all but bankrupted himself publishing, advertising, serialising and staging his work. His books barely sold. Performances became pitched battles between Surrealists and their opponents who bombarded the stage with coins and baked apples. And he could never understand why. </p> <p>Born in the same circumstances as Proust, Roussel lived an equally insulated life. He never wore clothes more than a certain number of times - collars once. He worked furiously, writing in a vacuum-sealed room in his vast villa or as he travelled endlessly round the world by ship without ever looking out of his cabin. It seems that, rather as Percy Grainger may be said to have been the inventor of the tracksuit, Roussel's impact on mass culture may have lain in tourism, rather than literature. When he became phobic to luggage, he devised a luxury caravan which became the talk of the motor shows. The total lack of consolations in his lonely life led him to commit suicide in 1933. </p> <p>As he has reached near-canonical status in France, people have tended to dwell on the life more than the work. But in this wonderful, first full-length account in English, the poet Ford has struck an impeccable balance. Roussel emerges as a luminous, unique figure, 'outrageous in his innocence and logic'. Reading this book, one understands why Breton said that he, along with Lautr\u00e9amont, is 'the greatest hypnotist of modern times.'</p>",

Professional biographers have become more and more efficient at providing exhaustive accounts of the inner crises that inflect the daily life of famous individuals, and less and less effective at offering coherent historical narratives of the times from which they emerge. Biography is the historiographical expression of a culture that fetishises personality. It's history lite.</p> <p>The Doctors of Revolution, by the Israeli writer Shlomo Barer, is scarcely adulterated or dilute. It's the real thing, or so it seems: a collective biography that, as the sleeve-notes tell us, is also 'history in the grand style'.

Professional biographers have become more and more efficient at providing exhaustive accounts of the inner crises that inflect the daily life of famous individuals, and less and less effective at offering coherent historical narratives of the times from which they emerge. Biography is the historiographical expression of a culture that fetishises personality. It's history lite. The Doctors of Revolution, by the Israeli writer Shlomo Barer, is scarcely adulterated or dilute. It's the real thing, or so it seems: a collective biography that, as the sleeve-notes tell us, is also 'history in the grand style'. In his acknowledgments, Barer rather blokeishly refers to his hope 'to bring to life in authentic detail a bunch of unusually controversial characters'. But this is a far more ambitious book than that. Covering the period between 1796 and the aftermath of 1848, it traces the lives of a group of philosophers and poets who, with Promethean impudence, set out to change the world as well as merely to interpret it. The biographies of Marx, Heine, the anarchist Bakunin, and at least 50 other lesser figures are unfurled by Barer in a fascinating narrative of the social and cultural history in which modernity itself was defined. The first half of the nineteenth century was a period in which European culture was capillarised with a sense of political optimism. On the margins of bourgeois society, confederations of exiles congregated to argue in crowded caf\u00e9s or the smoke-filled offices of literary journals.

Buckingham was widely hated for his Catholic sympathies and his flagrant manipulation to his own ends of the Stuart patronage and subsidies system - the more so in view of his perceived Svengali-like influence over the king. </p> <p>Contemporary ballads openly accused the two of them of sodomy (though the perpetrators of such 'libels' were invariably arrested and imprisoned). The king was devastated by Buckingham's death while the general public openly rejoiced at the end of a malign influence over their monarch. </p> <p>John Felton, the man who fatally stabbed Buckingham in the chest with a ten-penny knife, was a professional soldier from a respectable, strongly Protestant family which had fallen on hard times. Buckingham owed him \u00a380 in back pay and had apparently denied him promotion. Arrested without a struggle at the scene of the crime - 'I am the man! Here I am!' he is supposed to have cried - Felton was tried for murder and hanged in November. His body was displayed on a public gibbet until it rotted. The event is seen as a turning point, a wake-up call to the king presaging the forthcoming civil wars. </p> <p>Buckingham's assassination has been described ever since as the deranged act of a loner with a grievance against his victim. Felton's behaviour, however, suggests more control and calm premeditation. In July he had borrowed a copy of a formal complaint lodged by the House of Commons against Buckingham for his Popish sympathies, and for the way he was conducting hostilities with France. Having read it, Felton fasted and prayed for two months, then, on 18 August, resolved to kill Buckingham.</p> <p>He borrowed money from his mother, purchased a dagger, and sewed a paper inside his hat stating that he was acting 'for the honour of his God, his king and his country'. Before setting out for Portsmouth he asked a local London church to say prayers for him the following Sunday. Afterwards he was calm and coherent; he conducted himself with dignity during his trial and while awaiting execution. </p> <p>In Ehud's Dagger, James Holstun re-examines Felton's story, and those of a sequence of other non-\u00e9lite individuals and groups who changed the course of history around the time of the so-called English Revolution. He argues that a coherent story can be told 'from below' of the events which led up to the execution of Charles I and the establishing, first of an English Commonwealth, and then of the Protectorate under Oliver Cromwell. According to Holstun, Felton, the visionary Anna Trapnell and the would-be assassin of Cromwell, Edward Sexby, were all motivated in part by immediate, personal contingencies and in part by arguments and attitudes held in common with the generality of their community - what Holstun anachronistically calls their 'class'. </p> <p>According to Holstun, Felton's mixed motivation - part private grievance, part sincerely held belief in his victim's pernicious influence upon the whole nation - produced a series of decisions which culminated in a consciously executed revolutionary act. </p> <p>'Felton complexly fused his personal and public motives: as a gentleman forced into military service, then subject to labour without pay and the humiliation of a public rebuff, he generalised the injury to his status and his stomach as an injury to the nation, and undertook a project that he thought would heal both at once.' </p> <p>Holstun wants to make a collection of seventeenth-century malcontents into the true heroes of the English Revolution. Exploiting the rich work which has been done on contextualising the English Revolution over the past 20 years, in both history and criticism (specifically new historicist criticism), he sets out to retrieve an unashamedly Marxist story of victorious proletariats, and the overthrow of protocapitalist \u00e9lites. Indeed, he spends almost half the book on a detailed appraisal of the work of the major scholars in the field of the past two decades - expending an enormous amount of verbal effort on winnowing the grain from the chaff, and ending up with a rather meagre kernel of what he regards as usable methodology. </p> <p>Holstun is charmingly open about the fact that such a turning back towards a Marxist account of this period of English history smacks of nostalgia. He is engaged, he says, on a radical project. 'By radical project, I mean praxis organised in a collective effort to totalise society by changing it from an oppressive inhuman thing controlling people from without, to a human process that people control for themselves in a relatively democratic way. That's at best a down payment on an argument, at worst a musty exercise in romantic anticapitalism. Even I feel a little awkward writing this way.' </p> <p>If Holstun feels awkward, so, I fear, does his reader. Holstun's accounts of his working people's lives and actions are vivid and compelling. Sadly, whenever he arrives at the point of serious analysis, the creaky Marxist categories arrest his fluency, and bog down fascinating evidence in a mire of jargon. </p> <p>John Felton and Anna Trapnell, Holstun shows us convincingly, did understand what they were undertaking. They acted strategically. Trapnell's swoons and prophetic trances enabled her to continue to speak out at moments when decorum and political exigency threatened to silence her. The soldiers of the New Model Army knowingly manipulated a language of group responsibility and no named leaders to thwart the efforts of senior officers to head off their radical initiatives. </p> <p>Holstun cannot establish whether any of his maverick agents of history could see the larger picture, or had a clear idea of what kind of crisis their actions might precipitate.

Even in childhood there seemed too many thoughts for his page, before he became one of the most astonishing writers of the Romantic age. Bare-knuckled controversialist, plangent lonely heart, impassioned theatre and art critic, he reinvented journalism and the essay. His favourite quality in art was 'gusto', which animates his own prose. </p> <p>AC Grayling (philosopher and broadsheet regular) is drawn to the critic-metaphysician, but forbearingly shunts philosophical discussion to the appendices of his measured biography. Hazlitt's unflinching directness helps Grayling keep emotion close to the surface. His most personal writing was his most public, full of fire and grudge, and his published work was his most confessional. </p> <p>Coleridge told Hazlitt that he had guts in his brains. A dissenting childhood and education encouraged uncomfortably independent thought, which remained a touchstone whether in impassioned response to Edmund Kean's magnetic acting, which made his reputation as a critic, or in his unpopular lifelong advocacy of Napoleon. He became a star hack, but could not long toe the party line for any publication. </p> <p>'I have never given the lie to my own soul,' claimed his last published essay: Hazlitt 'set out in life with the French Revolution' and clasped his principles close. He had an unforgiving eye for backsliders like Wordsworth and Coleridge, whom he had trudged 10 muddy miles to hear as a youth, but who later disappointed ('Alas! Frailty, thy name is Genius!'). His attacks on the poets were cruelly supported by close reading, though generous about their best work. In turn, Grayling amusingly tracks their elaborate tittle-tattle, slinging more dirt with each repetition. </p> <p>A friend said he had never known Hazlitt out of love, but although he married two spirited women, he never achieved the relationship he idealised.

      "bodyText": "The Quarrel of the Age: the Life and Times of William Hazlitt AC Grayling Weidenfeld and Nicholson \u00a325, pp399 Buy it at BOL 'I wish people made larger paper,' wrote William Hazlitt at 12. Even in childhood there seemed too many thoughts for his page, before he became one of the most astonishing writers of the Romantic age. Bare-knuckled controversialist, plangent lonely heart, impassioned theatre and art critic, he reinvented journalism and the essay. His favourite quality in art was 'gusto', which animates his own prose. AC Grayling (philosopher and broadsheet regular) is drawn to the critic-metaphysician, but forbearingly shunts philosophical discussion to the appendices of his measured biography. Hazlitt's unflinching directness helps Grayling keep emotion close to the surface. His most personal writing was his most public, full of fire and grudge, and his published work was his most confessional. Coleridge told Hazlitt that he had guts in his brains. A dissenting childhood and education encouraged uncomfortably independent thought, which remained a touchstone whether in impassioned response to Edmund Kean's magnetic acting, which made his reputation as a critic, or in his unpopular lifelong advocacy of Napoleon. He became a star hack, but could not long toe the party line for any publication. 'I have never given the lie to my own soul,' claimed his last published essay: Hazlitt 'set out in life with the French Revolution' and clasped his principles close. He had an unforgiving eye for backsliders like Wordsworth and Coleridge, whom he had trudged 10 muddy miles to hear as a youth, but who later disappointed ('Alas! Frailty, thy name is Genius!'). His attacks on the poets were cruelly supported by close reading, though generous about their best work. In turn, Grayling amusingly tracks their elaborate tittle-tattle, slinging more dirt with each repetition. A friend said he had never known Hazlitt out of love, but although he married two spirited women, he never achieved the relationship he idealised. Unusually sexually savvy in print - he caused outrage by insisting that Desdemona married Othello because she fancied him rotten - he yearned for a romantic, erotic and intellectual partnership. Too much reading, probably.",

The fans will no doubt blame Tottenham's negativity under George Graham as they sat back, believing that all they needed to do was play out time for their first away league victory of the season. They paid an expensive price which will do little to ease the pressure on Graham or Alan Sugar, his chairman. </p> <p>The match saw the reappearance of the popular Bantam Bird mascot after a local campaign to have him restored. But it was the Tottenham cockerel which crowed first. It was an unusual goal too. </p> <p>Spurs kicked off but the referee made them retake it because Les Ferdinand had encroached into the Bradford half. From the restart the ball fell to King, who hit a shot from 25 yards which took a deflection off Jamie Lawrence and spun past Matt Clarke into the bottom corner of the net. </p> <p>It provided an early wake-up call and within eight minutes Lawrence had restored the balance. Dean Windass hitting in a corner which the Bradford midfielder bundled past Neil Sullivan. </p> <p>If the Spurs fans expected their team to capitulate at this point they were pleasantly surprised in the 21st minute. Having withstood some home pressure, they won a disputed corner which Stephen Clemence landed onto the head of Sol Campbell, who directed it past Clarke with a diving effort. </p> <p>The Spurs support were transported back to a happier era with their side's third goal seven minutes after the break, which was in the old Tottenham tradition. Ferdinand cushioned a long ball from Sullivan and displayed wonderful awareness to slip the ball to Tim Sherwood. He responded with a pass back to Ferdinand, which dissected the home defence, allowing the former England striker to roll the ball into the path of Armstrong who tapped it home. </p> <p>They should have known better than to start celebrating too early because in the 69th minute Bradford brought themselves back into it when Peter Atherton crossed for Windass to head home. Stan Collymore had a header ruled out for offside and Windass hit the post before Bradford drew level. Lee Sharpe's cross was headed back across the goal by Stuart McCall for Carbone to smash the ball home. It was little wonder that Jeffries praised his side's spirit.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is no coincidence that Bradford's fans have abandoned the five-minute dash to leave early since Jim Jeffries took over as manager as, for the third consecutive match since the Scotsman replaced Chris Hutchings, his side were involved in a dramatic finish. At Middlesbrough they conceded a late goal which cost them victory, against Coventry the following week they came from behind to record a rare win and they completed the sequence here when Benito Carbone's spectacular 89th-minute volley rescued a point against Tottenham to take them off the bottom of the Premiership. That looked an unlikely conclusion when Ledley King scored for the visitors after only 10 seconds, the fastest goal in the Premiership's history, and again when Chris Armstrong put them 3-1 up nine minutes into the second-half. But, having come out of the blocks like an Olympic sprinter, Tottenham collapsed across the line like a Sunday jogger hitting the wall in the London Marathon. The fans will no doubt blame Tottenham's negativity under George Graham as they sat back, believing that all they needed to do was play out time for their first away league victory of the season. They paid an expensive price which will do little to ease the pressure on Graham or Alan Sugar, his chairman. The match saw the reappearance of the popular Bantam Bird mascot after a local campaign to have him restored. But it was the Tottenham cockerel which crowed first. It was an unusual goal too. Spurs kicked off but the referee made them retake it because Les Ferdinand had encroached into the Bradford half. From the restart the ball fell to King, who hit a shot from 25 yards which took a deflection off Jamie Lawrence and spun past Matt Clarke into the bottom corner of the net. It provided an early wake-up call and within eight minutes Lawrence had restored the balance. Dean Windass hitting in a corner which the Bradford midfielder bundled past Neil Sullivan. If the Spurs fans expected their team to capitulate at this point they were pleasantly surprised in the 21st minute. Having withstood some home pressure, they won a disputed corner which Stephen Clemence landed onto the head of Sol Campbell, who directed it past Clarke with a diving effort. The Spurs support were transported back to a happier era with their side's third goal seven minutes after the break, which was in the old Tottenham tradition. Ferdinand cushioned a long ball from Sullivan and displayed wonderful awareness to slip the ball to Tim Sherwood. He responded with a pass back to Ferdinand, which dissected the home defence, allowing the former England striker to roll the ball into the path of Armstrong who tapped it home. They should have known better than to start celebrating too early because in the 69th minute Bradford brought themselves back into it when Peter Atherton crossed for Windass to head home. Stan Collymore had a header ruled out for offside and Windass hit the post before Bradford drew level. Lee Sharpe's cross was headed back across the goal by Stuart McCall for Carbone to smash the ball home. It was little wonder that Jeffries praised his side's spirit.",

Twice in the first half he smothered the ball as Sam Dalla Bona raced through; twice he was fully extended by long-range shots from Dennis Wise and Rati Aleksidze.

Six minutes later Taribo West, given an opportunity to clear Wise's flick, somehow allowed Gustavo Poyet to produce a low centre that Gudjohnsen slid in to prod home. </p> <p>'He's got a lot of talent, and he's only young,' said Wise after a performance in which Chelsea's youth shone in all areas of the pitch, with Dalla Bona in midfield and John Terry in defence sharing the plaudits with Gudjohnsen. </p> <p>'All our young lads played extremely well. It's nice to have youngsters playing because as you get older you can't play as often as you like.' </p> <p>Eight minutes before half-time, Chelsea scored their third as Terry's immaculate 45-yard crossfield pass fell at Babayaro's feet on the left wing. The Nigerian's control was poor, but only sent the ball rolling to Gudjohnsen, who had time and space to find Poyet with a right-footed cross which was headed emphatically past Poom. </p> <p>'We were just too passive, and I don't know why,' said Derby manager Jim Smith. 'The first goal should have been cleared with comfort, the second was schoolboy defending by West which really just summed the first half up, and for the third we had two men in the box and Poyet got a free header. They were all really amateur goals.' </p> <p>To be fair, Derby were forced into changes after last week's impressive win at Ipswich, with Seth Johnson suspended and Georgi Kinkladze and Stefano Eranio victims of colds. Smith was forced to play the transfer-listed Lars Bohinen, whose last start had been in Derby's 4-0 defeat here in May. </p> <p>He is unlikely to have been too pleased by the improvement. Chelsea were also hit by suspensions, with Frank Leboeuf and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink ruled out, but any fears that the loss of their top scorer would see them lose their cutting edge were swiftly dispelled. </p> <p>Eight minutes after half-time Gianfranco Zola capped another fine move with the fourth, lashing in a left-footed drive when fed by Dalla Bona. Chris Riggott's consolation, a free header from Lilian Martin's free-kick two minutes later, lent the scoreline a flattering sense of dignity for Derby, when in truth it should have shouted only humiliation. </p> <p>'We're fine at home,' said Wise. 'We play very well at home. But we've got to sort something out away from home, because that's where things seem to be going wrong.' </p> <p>A record of one defeat in 20 home games is certainly not what one would expect from a team sitting 11th in the league.

But the Irish goalkeeper excelled in the second half, saving well from Giggs, Solskjaer and Roy Keane, who made amends when he increased United's lead with a shot that Kiely got his hand to but could not prevent from crossing the line. That should have been that, but for the third time this season United let a 3-1 lead evaporate - or rather Charlton wrenched it away from them. Bartlett gave them hope when his stooping header made it 3-2 in the 79th minute, and substitute John Robinson ensured it was a happy Valley when he scored with a shot on the turn after Jensen's 85th minute corner was only half-cleared. 'What pleased me most was that we got back into it by playing good football, not just through blood and guts,' said Curbishley. 'The players were really on the floor at half-time, most teams would have folded when United went 3-1 ahead.' Ferguson agreed. 'Charlton kept going and deserved a point. In every season there is a game when you have to battle and scrap.'",

      "body": "<p>There used to come a point in almost every movie musical when one of the inevitable Broadway wannabes would look round the barn and pipe up, 'Let's put the show on right here!' The response was usually along the lines of 'Well, it's mad, but it just might work...' And lo! Everyone sang and danced their way to success. </p> <p>Truth being stranger than clich\u00e9, that very notion of re-inventing theatre spaces - or, to borrow estate agent terminology, location, location, location - is spreading through theatre like wildfire for the simple reason that the biggest problem facing the allegedly dying art form is the buildings themselves. </p> <p>The terms 'theatre' and 'West End' have become synonymous. Say the word 'theatre' and most people immediately think chocolate-box interiors, gilt proscenium arch and uncomfortable seats. In other words, lush, plush and dangerous to go. </p> <p>Venues such as the Elizabethan Globe theatre or adaptable 'black box' studio theatres up and down the country are bold reminders that theatre did not always aspire to the polite, Victorian condition of safe, well-dressed, middle-class audiences watching similarly safe, well-dressed, middle-class characters on stage. </p> <p>Yet the overwhelming majority of British theatres spring from - and are mired in - nineteenth century architecture and artistic ideals. Some of them, particularly those designed by the great Frank Matcham, are acoustic marvels in which the majority of the audience sits in close relation to the stage, but all too often they're redolent of museums. They're hardly versatile or suited to the expectations of twenty-first century audiences. </p> <p>For experiment and excitement you have to look further afield, which explains the appeal of 'event theatre' such as the Shakespeare in Shoreditch season where the Almeida director Jonathan Kent turned the old Gainsborough film studios (which had been languishing in neglect, having been used as a musty, cluttered carpet warehouse) into a temporary theatre to house Richard II and Coriolanus starring Ralph Fiennes. With that success under his belt, Kent has turned his attentions to two further events, both home and away. </p> <p>Before closing for a lottery-funded refit, the Almeida will host his production of The Tempest , designed by his Gainsborough designer Paul Brown and starring his fellow artistic director Ian McDiarmid as Prospero. As soon as that is up and running, Kent and company will decamp to less than luxurious Kings Cross. </p> <p>This means that although Anna Friel recently graced Broadway in Patrick Marber's Closer, from next March you can see her in Kent's production of Lulu - Wedekind's study of sexual obsession - in an old bus station, which designer Rob Howell will be turning into a 500-seat theatre. </p> <p>Originally, there was talk of creating the production at The Old Vic, but Kent is excited that the Almeida team has pulled off the Kings Cross project. 'It has its own aesthetic, a sort of urban brutalism in rather sharp contrast to the high Romanticism of the Gainsborough Studios.' Kent's father, brother and cousin are all architects so the language is second nature to him. The neatness of presenting so famous a sexual portrait in this location hasn't escaped him - 'the area has its fair share of Lulus' - and he welcomes the fact that this will help give the play a contemporary edge. </p> <p>Placing plays in context in this way is nothing new. As far as I know, nobody has yet staged The Sound of Music in an Austrian Schloss, but five years ago Max Stafford-Clark presented his production of Three Sisters upstairs, downstairs and in my lady's chamber in a dramatically snowbound country house in Hertfordshire to illuminating effect. </p> <p>It's not quite a case of 'if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen', more 'if you want to be truly theatrical, get out of the theatre'. </p> <p>Kent is one of those directors who still cleaves to tradition by presenting plays but who tends to shy away from traditional buildings. He has successfully directed the Almeida company in the West End but he seems happier being involved in increasingly imaginative makeovers of often derelict buildings. </p> <p>The term 'location scout' used to be confined to cinema, one of those vaguely self-explanatory phrases that drifted past you during the credits unlike its more enigmatic compatriots 'Key Grip' or 'Best Boy'. Increasingly, however, 'location scout' is becoming part of Kent's job description. And he's not alone. </p> <p>Tastes have changed and much of this is bound up in a question of size. Many directors are now more than a little uncomfortable working in large-scale theatres. You don't have to run the National to realise that an enormous stage like the Olivier Theatre (let alone the 1,100-seat auditorium) is hugely problematic to fill. </p> <p>Tim Supple recently foundered directing Romeo and Juliet at the Olivier, but his small-scale Shakespeare at the RSC and the Young Vic had been strikingly atmospheric. Indeed, exceptions like Michael Grandage's powerful work on the vast open stage of the Sheffield Crucible notwithstanding, almost every great Shakespeare production of the last 25 years from Trevor Nunn's terrifying and justly legendary Macbeth to Stephen Pimlott's arrestingly analytical Richard II has taken place in a small space. </p> <p>That is directly reflected in the the atres that regularly hog the limelight, ie the 250-seat Donmar and the 300-seat Almeida. Why? Because audiences weaned on TV and film close-up want to get up close and personal. Furthermore, the addiction to TV-style naturalism - more behaving than acting - can initially make the bolder, more energised acting required in large theatres seem vaguely out of proportion and difficult to take. </p> <p>Those directors who don't have the organisational back-up or clout to convert an industrial building into a theatre are opting in ever greater numbers for the late-twentieth century alternative: site-specific work. Utterly unlikely venues are being commandeered for one-off experiment. Are You Being Served? proved that department stores aren't usually centres of dramatic excellence, but passers-by (and the media) were fascinated when the London International Festival of Theatre (LIFT) presented an ongoing, non-stop life-story 'acted out' behind the windows of Clapham's department store Arding and Hobbs. </p> <p>Two years earlier, director Deborah Warner took individuals along a shiveringly creepy journey through the abandoned St Pancras Hotel. It was like being on a ghost train with no engine but real chills. She then put angels in the architecture, turning a disused top floor of the Euston Tower into what might be termed 'a playground'. </p> <p>All of these might more usefully be described as theatrical installations, a form that reached an early high with Robert Wilson's thrilling, gravely beautiful HG in London's Clink vaults - the most highly charged drama I've ever seen without actors, each room absolutely hummed with the uncanny tension between absence and presence. A minutely recreated 1900s dining room ached with the sense of its inhabitants having fled, leaving behind overturned chairs and a congealed, unfinished meal; a post-First World War influenza ward was conjured up by serried ranks of immaculately-made, ghoulishly over-lit, empty beds. </p> <p>Over the past 20 years, LIFT has radically - and occasionally roguishly - redefined what we regard as theatre and much of the experimentation in this country can be traced to its influence. </p> <p>Theatregoers were even to be found lapping up experiments in Bobby Baker's north London kitchen. And next year boasts further frontline activity with, among other things, pyrotechnics in a Hackney park, a show which ditches seats and replaces them with beds, and a night-time journey in boats along the Thames. </p> <p>Not that every out-of-theatre experiment has produced ravishing results. The Turn of the Screw at Clerkenwell's ancient House of Detention turned out to be all gong and no dinner: heaps of atmosphere and spooky lighting but no clearly defined space in which to present a convincing narrative. </p> <p>Even Th\u00e9tre de Complicit\u00e9 wunderkind Simon McBurney came a cropper when he went site-specific with The Vertical Line . He crossed a John Berger lecture with a walking tour in a disused tube tunnel: it was full of resonance, little substance and less drama. </p> <p>Kent's valedictory production at the Almeida cunningly straddles both styles. The site-specific quality comes from designer Paul Brown's almost 'Goodbye to all that' approach, putting up scaffolding and knocking down part of the structure in advance of the rebuild. At the same time it amounts to a re-invention of a known space. </p> <p>Brown sees it as being highly appropriate to the ideas that course through Shakespeare's final play. ' The Tempest is peculiarly appropriate. It's about discord and union: we're doing the chaos, the actors are doing the resolution.' The rebuild and roof replacement - for reasons of safety and audience comfort - means that Brown has licence to make waves. Literally. His design uses tons of water to create a space in which the elements appear to have taken over. 'The storm's a storm, not a slight shower. It would be so much safer to stick with grains of sand and a jug of water but we're going for big again.' </p> <p>Such grand projects - so-called 'event theatre' - can have unlooked-for consequences. The circumstances of a hyped production can outweigh its true content. Kent is also aware that short-term gain can lead to long-term strain. 'The danger is that you brutalise an audience who only respond to the event,' he observes cautiously. Brown is even clearer. 'The danger of constantly trying to find different ways is that you re-invent theatre, but forget to do the work.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, the future of theatre unquestionably lies in upsetting deadening certainty. Satisfaction guaranteed is fine for Holiday Inns but stultifying for audiences. The secret is in the equation between audience, material and environment. </p> <p>Or, as Jeanette Winterson put it in Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit: 'Something unexpected in a usual place (our favourite aunt in our favourite poker parlour) or something usual in an unexpected place (our favourite poker in our favourite aunt).' </p> <p>Coincidentally, in the mid-Eighties, Winterson used to write the odd theatre review. Maybe she was on to something. </p> <p> 'The Tempest' opens at the Almeida, London N1 on Thursday (020 7359 4404) </p> <p>'Lulu' opens at Kings Cross in March.</p>",

In that context, Gray's goal must be regarded as a bonus for Reid. Yet Sunderland's second-half performance was certainly more incisive. No doubt chastened by what Reid usually describes as 'a few words' during the break, Sunderland coped better with Middlesbrough's rugged approach. </p> <p>The home team promised much with Gavin McCann's 20-yard shot which prompted a fine save from Schwarzer in the opening seconds of the half. And they delivered on that promise thanks to the gruesome error by Schwarzer. </p> <p>The angle was sharp when Sunderland skipper Gray closed in on a loose ball in the 54th minute, but the keeper allowed a low shot to skid through his arms and under his body for the full-back's first goal of the season. </p> <p>Kevin Phillips came close to scoring on either side of the goal, but Middlesbrough's spirited response to the setback was another plus point for Venables.

Minutes later O'Halloran pulled off a back-heel, received the ball back and fizzed a shot just past the upright. </p> <p>Piling on the early pressure it was obvious that Swindon had taken in new gaffer Andy King's wise words in the programme: 'I have said for a long time now that we will find it easier to compete if we can get ourselves ahead in games instead of going behind.' Absolutely, Andy, and here's another thing - the team that scores the most goals wins. </p> <p>On 17 minutes O'Halloran struck again. Danny Invincible, once of the Marconi Stallions, teed the ball up on the edge of the area and O'Halloran belted it over Swan and into the net. It was a high-quality goal, quite out of keeping with the game. </p> <p>The big question, now: would Swindon, one-nil up, find it 'easier to compete'? Gratifyingly for Andy King the answer was yes.

Swindon were in the ascendant, Gateshead were struggling to defend their one-goal deficit. </p> <p>Six minutes after half-time, the ball bobbled on the edge of the area and O'Halloran scissor-kicked it on the half-volley over Swan and into the net. Gateshead, who had never really got into the game, were now pretty much out of it. </p> <p>But encouraged by their fans, who banged on their drum and chanted throughout, Gateshead struggled on and even forced Bart Griemink to make a save when he backpedalled quickly after Paul Talbot's cross turned into a shot. Swindon, however, remained the more dangerous. They should have increased their lead as Williams first missed the goal from four yards and then from six yards and finally managed to place a glancing header on target only for the ball to be cleared off the line by captain Kitchen.

Even their fans stopped singing. Substitutions were made, 'young Alan Young', just 17, coming on for Invincible and setting up a goal for Steve Cowe. With three minutes to go Bobby Howe scored and the crowd, well, they thought about booing but most of them gave him a polite clap. They were more enthusiastic about Cowe's second and Swindon's fifth.

      "byline": "Glenn Gibbons at Rugby Park",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This was a match a visiting manager would find easy to love. Especially if, as in Hearts' Craig Levein's case, he had only taken over eight days earlier. For Levein, here was a day to savour. For Bobby Williamson and those supporters with Kilmarnock tattooed onto their affections, it was something of an ordeal. </p> <p>In the conditions - a freezing, cutting wind made Rugby Park a trial - nobody could reasonably expect an exhibition of top-quality football. In this regard, the home support would not have been surprised to see their side give a pedestrian and aimless performance. </p> <p>In these circumstances, players are often accused of a lack of endeavour. It is, of course, usually quite the opposite, with those taking part striving energetically to gain an edge and managing only to aggravate their own problems with passes over-hit through anxiety and defensive lapses induced by haste. No amount of urgency can alter those days - and, for Kilmarnock, this was one of them - when most of those taking part appear to be afflicted by a loss of touch. </p> <p>Steve Fulton, Andy Kirk and a number of other Tynecastle players proved immediately before and soon after half-time to be gratifying exceptions to the general dishevelment of the first half - when Hearts, too, looked quite cumbersome - when they scored the goals which made victory a certainty. </p> <p>But just before Fulton's opener no bookmaker would have accepted a single wager on the game ending scoreless. Opportunities had been as rare as an accurate train schedule, thanks largely to moderate and unimaginative passing from defence and midfield. </p> <p>An individual piece of improvisation was required and Fulton provided it on the stroke of half-time when he carried the ball forward from midfield, played a slick one-two with Colin Cameron and slid the ball low to the left of Gordon Marshall from the left side of the penalty area. </p> <p>Kirk owed his later opportunities to appalling defending by the home side, but the little striker's finishing was magnificent.

      "bodyText": "This was a match a visiting manager would find easy to love. Especially if, as in Hearts' Craig Levein's case, he had only taken over eight days earlier. For Levein, here was a day to savour. For Bobby Williamson and those supporters with Kilmarnock tattooed onto their affections, it was something of an ordeal. In the conditions - a freezing, cutting wind made Rugby Park a trial - nobody could reasonably expect an exhibition of top-quality football. In this regard, the home support would not have been surprised to see their side give a pedestrian and aimless performance. In these circumstances, players are often accused of a lack of endeavour. It is, of course, usually quite the opposite, with those taking part striving energetically to gain an edge and managing only to aggravate their own problems with passes over-hit through anxiety and defensive lapses induced by haste. No amount of urgency can alter those days - and, for Kilmarnock, this was one of them - when most of those taking part appear to be afflicted by a loss of touch. Steve Fulton, Andy Kirk and a number of other Tynecastle players proved immediately before and soon after half-time to be gratifying exceptions to the general dishevelment of the first half - when Hearts, too, looked quite cumbersome - when they scored the goals which made victory a certainty. But just before Fulton's opener no bookmaker would have accepted a single wager on the game ending scoreless. Opportunities had been as rare as an accurate train schedule, thanks largely to moderate and unimaginative passing from defence and midfield. An individual piece of improvisation was required and Fulton provided it on the stroke of half-time when he carried the ball forward from midfield, played a slick one-two with Colin Cameron and slid the ball low to the left of Gordon Marshall from the left side of the penalty area. Kirk owed his later opportunities to appalling defending by the home side, but the little striker's finishing was magnificent. A long kick from Antti Niemi was completely missed by Sean Hessey, giving Kirk possession 25 yards out. He quickly volleyed it over Marshall, his technique so precise that the ball dipped under the bar with feet to spare. Gus MacPherson must have been infected by Hessey's sluggishness soon after, when he miscalculated a clearance and knocked the ball against Kirk, leaving the Hearts man to run unchallenged into the penalty area. He chose a spot low to the right of Marshall and delivered the ball to it with his right foot from 12 yards. Victory was the least Hearts deserved. Even during that generally uninspired first half, they were the more compact and intelligent side, always appearing more likely to inflict damage.

Truly, madly, deeply, he cares about Sheffield Wednesday Football Club - and there haven't exactly been truckloads who do on the payroll in recent years. </p> <p>His brand of loyalty borders on self-sacrifice.

As French agents representing Frederic 'King' Kanoute and non-scoring 'striker' Kaba Diawara waited for them to change, they admired the pictures of Hammers past and present on the walls. Pausing before a picture of the 1966 World Cup winners, with Bobby Moore holding the trophy aloft, one of the agents asked a passerby: 'Which one is 'Arry?'. Harry, we salute you. Not only are you the game's most geezerish wheeler-dealer, but your aura of greatness has somehow convinced people you won the game's ultimate prize in 1966.

      "body": "<p>The FA Cup second round brought further embarrassment to Nationwide League teams. </p> <p>The ones with particular cause to take a critical look at themselves were Lincoln City, who fell 1-0 at home to Dagenham and Redbridge - a last-minute goal by Mark Janney; Cambridge United, who fell 2-1 at Morecambe and Oxford United, who were two goals ahead at Chester but crashed 3-2. </p> <p>Another team with red faces were Orient, who found themselves 3-2 behind at Northwich - after being 2-0 in front - and scrambled to a draw through a Chris Tate goal eight minutes from the end. </p> <p>Such signs of vulnerability are rather more difficult to detect at the top of the First Division, where Fulham increased their lead to 10 points with a stunning 3-1 win at West Bromwich Albion. Fulham midfielder scored their first two goals - both crackers - and after Des Lyttle had given the home team a glimmer of hope, Andre Stolcers put them firmly in their place again. </p> <p>In addition Fulham and Chesterfield (the only teams unbeaten away), Wimbledon also have an excellent record on opponents' grounds. </p> <p>However, their players might well have viewed the 3-0 win at Birmingham with mixed feelings - and that also applies to their wives and girlfriends. </p> <p>In an interview in The Sun, Wimbledon's manager, Terry Burton, had suggested that the contrast between his team's results at home and away might have had something to do with the fact that his players usually spend the eve of an away game in a hotel on their own. </p> <p>To Burton, the good thing about that is that there is little danger of their energy being sapped by too much sex. Wimbledon have won as many as seven of their First Division away matches this season - compared to only one victory at Selhurst Park - and Burton said: 'Maybe they are rampant when they stay at home the night before a game and are then worn out for the game. </p> <p>'Right now, we have no plans to put them in a hotel before home matches - but who knows?' </p> <p>The latest away success was some result - not least because Wimbledon's centre-forward, John Hartson, was sent off. Wimbledon were 2-0 ahead when he was banished after 67 minutes, but Birmingham's hopes of a comeback were destroyed by a second goal from Damien Francis. </p> <p>Being 'rampant' - in the way Burton interprets it - is clearly no problem for QPR, the only team who have yet to win away. and a side who have not exactly been impressive at home either. </p> <p>Before the trip to Blackburn, their manager, Gerry Francis, had said: 'We have been letting in some disappointing goals, so we've been working hard this week to tighten that up.' </p> <p>It seemed to work because, apart from a penalty which Matt Jansen missed, Blackburn had few clear chances. However, QPR's run without an away win continued; they had to settle for a goalless draw. </p> <p>It was two points lost rather than one gained for them, because the teams below them in the bottom three - Huddersfield and Stockport - both won. </p> <p>Blackburn defender Darren Peacock has announced his retirement from the game on medical advice. </p> <p>The decision follows a serious neck injury Peacock sustained while playing on loan for Wolves at Fulham last month. </p> <p>'It is disappointing to say the least and not how I planned to end my career, but the medical people said it would be too risky for me to play on,' said Peacock, who joined Blackburn on a free in June 1998 from Newcastle United.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The FA Cup second round brought further embarrassment to Nationwide League teams. The ones with particular cause to take a critical look at themselves were Lincoln City, who fell 1-0 at home to Dagenham and Redbridge - a last-minute goal by Mark Janney; Cambridge United, who fell 2-1 at Morecambe and Oxford United, who were two goals ahead at Chester but crashed 3-2. Another team with red faces were Orient, who found themselves 3-2 behind at Northwich - after being 2-0 in front - and scrambled to a draw through a Chris Tate goal eight minutes from the end. Such signs of vulnerability are rather more difficult to detect at the top of the First Division, where Fulham increased their lead to 10 points with a stunning 3-1 win at West Bromwich Albion. Fulham midfielder scored their first two goals - both crackers - and after Des Lyttle had given the home team a glimmer of hope, Andre Stolcers put them firmly in their place again. In addition Fulham and Chesterfield (the only teams unbeaten away), Wimbledon also have an excellent record on opponents' grounds. However, their players might well have viewed the 3-0 win at Birmingham with mixed feelings - and that also applies to their wives and girlfriends. In an interview in The Sun, Wimbledon's manager, Terry Burton, had suggested that the contrast between his team's results at home and away might have had something to do with the fact that his players usually spend the eve of an away game in a hotel on their own. To Burton, the good thing about that is that there is little danger of their energy being sapped by too much sex. Wimbledon have won as many as seven of their First Division away matches this season - compared to only one victory at Selhurst Park - and Burton said: 'Maybe they are rampant when they stay at home the night before a game and are then worn out for the game. 'Right now, we have no plans to put them in a hotel before home matches - but who knows?' The latest away success was some result - not least because Wimbledon's centre-forward, John Hartson, was sent off. Wimbledon were 2-0 ahead when he was banished after 67 minutes, but Birmingham's hopes of a comeback were destroyed by a second goal from Damien Francis. Being 'rampant' - in the way Burton interprets it - is clearly no problem for QPR, the only team who have yet to win away. and a side who have not exactly been impressive at home either. Before the trip to Blackburn, their manager, Gerry Francis, had said: 'We have been letting in some disappointing goals, so we've been working hard this week to tighten that up.' It seemed to work because, apart from a penalty which Matt Jansen missed, Blackburn had few clear chances. However, QPR's run without an away win continued; they had to settle for a goalless draw. It was two points lost rather than one gained for them, because the teams below them in the bottom three - Huddersfield and Stockport - both won. Blackburn defender Darren Peacock has announced his retirement from the game on medical advice. The decision follows a serious neck injury Peacock sustained while playing on loan for Wolves at Fulham last month. 'It is disappointing to say the least and not how I planned to end my career, but the medical people said it would be too risky for me to play on,' said Peacock, who joined Blackburn on a free in June 1998 from Newcastle United.",

      "bodyText": "The magic of the cup is an expression we hear less and less these days, which is a sad indictment of the modern game. This week in the Worthington Cup, we at Crystal Palace take on Sunderland, Fulham play Liverpool and there are two other First Division sides in the quarter-finals - Birmingham and Sheffield Wednesday. No Manchester United, Arsenal or Chelsea in there, but this is a competition some of the bigger clubs do not take too seriously these days. And let's face it, if Manchester United can treat the FA Cup so lightly that they did not enter it last season, why would they take the Worthington Cup any more seriously? But the bigger clubs' loss is our gain, and this competition is now the best chance for First Division and smaller Premiership clubs to have a big day out, though sadly not at Wembley for a few years to come.

      "body": "<p>When you think what Europe has given Argentina down the centuries - hundreds of poor, moaning Welsh farmers; the planet's most notorious Nazi war criminals; Pedro de Mendoza and his murderous conquistadors; Max Hastings yomping pompously into Port Stanley; Jeremy Irons overacting dolorously in The Mission; and the comparatively benign offerings of Catholicism, scrofula and Sun headlines - it's a wonder they don't turn us back at Buenos Aires's groovy new airport with a clack of silvered heels and a polite request to take off before we start introducing ugliness, or vegetarianism. </p> <p>They don't, of course. They're too well-mannered, too friendly, too European themselves. And they're happy these days for people to see their gloriously eclectic country. Too often in recent years, it seems, Argentina has been used simply as a jumping-off point for South America in general - Peru, Chile, Patagonia - by the type of backpacker who wants to 'find himself' (stink) for six months before coming safely back to his Ladbroke Grove trust fund with a knot round his wrist and absurd hygiene theories. </p> <p>So the grown-up thing to do is stay inside the borders, spend a little money and savour the oddnesses and beauties of this proud and bizarre country, from soup to nuts, tropics to tundra. There's so much to enjoy about Argentina - heady nights in the capital, all art and dance and tales and drink, or the life-affirming serenity of the pampas, and all of it floodingly scented with history, awash with love and blood, sex and death - that it's hard to take in on one trip. </p> <p>But it would be daft to go to this continent without a trip north to Iguazu Falls, South America's Niagara. Here, after 800 miles gathering anger across Brazil, the river reaches the end of a high plateau on the border with Argentina and Paraguay and, as reality itself appears to schism, hurls itself into space with the force of a great sea tumbling off the edge of the world. </p> <p>You can follow walkways high and low almost all the way round the 275 cataracts - some, like the seriously frightening Garganta del Diablo (Devil's Throat), falling 270 feet straight to the teeth of the gorge with a booming power that soaks you with spray and adrenalin, others catching outcrops on the way to send jets streaming towards the ferns and macaws and orchids of the surrounding jungle. There are grand views too from the Brazilian side, to which you can cross temporarily with a little organisation. But the best views are from below, by boat: walk to the foot of the gorge and board one of the 'ribs' which speed out and under the highest of the falls: you'll return soaked, but exhilarated if not downright delirious. </p> <p>For falls which are more impressive (by all accounts) than Niagara, Iguazu is charmingly uncluttered with tourists. Still, if you want to get completely away from humanity, try spending a night or two at the nearby <a href=\"http://www.yacutinga.com\">Yacutinga eco-lodge</a> in the tropical heart of the huge protected 'green corridor' shared by Brazil and Argentina. Peace envelops you as warmly as the foliage, and days can be spent drifting in canoes in search of the perfect toucan and the scariest spider, or just eating by the pool, readying yourself for the lurch back into Buenos Aires. </p> <p>Astoundingly European with its wide colonial avenues, belle epoque architecture and waterfronts worn from the first steps of generations of Italians, Spanish, Germans and British seeking the new Europe, the capital is reminiscent of Lisbon, perhaps, or Paris before the bombing, albeit with many more inhabitants - 13 million at the last count. You could stay for two weeks easily, just learning your history and wandering between flea-markets and public gardens; but there are two or three trips which you should try to make, even if simply passing through. </p> <p>La Recoleta is a cemetery in the way that Iguazu is a waterfall. A strange and beautiful city of the dead, this necropolis covers acres of Buenos Aires' most exclusive land with impossible plinths and black marble obelisks and hauntingly surreal Deco sculpture. People save up their entire lives to die here. I was reluctant to leave until, at the Duarte family tomb wherein lies the body of Eva Peron, a fat, ringletted American - sporting, unaccountably, what appeared to be a velour kettledrum around her waist - decided to enhance the quiet reflection of the moment by screeching 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina', which was saddening, not least because I once vowed to get through life without having Lloyd Webber sung in front of me again except by someone holding a loaded pistol. </p> <p>It took three fabulous ice-creams and a trip to the Tigre delta to rid my face of its rictus of fascinated loathing. But two minutes on the river and cares fly. The delta, a labyrinthine twist of scores of miles of criss-crossing brown water surrounding lush woodland, is where Buenos Aires, rich and poor, comes to play on weekends and holidays. Lumpen coracles and belching river buses jostle the sleek speedboats, all sending a high dirty wash blattering against the pilings of a thousand riverside homes. These range from peeling ramshackle hutches to glittering simulacrums of Versailles, but high- and low-born swim, tan and feast together and the effect is colourful, easy, wet and rather wonderful. </p> <p>Take time on the way back to cruise through the San Isidro district, a kind of Hampstead of Buenos Aires, with its fine churches and views, and try not to be put off by the thought that many happy years were also spent here by Josef Mengele, thanks to Juan Peron's liberal attitude to post-war passports for architects of the destruction of European Jewry. </p> <p>The waterfront in the centre is where you'll want to feed: every other capital waterfront in the world may also have been converted into ritzy wine bars, but this one's been done well. The old town itself, however, is still marvellous for food, and for decent tango clubs. Pass, too, through the other waterfront area, La Boca, once the archetypal dodgy dockside roughhouse where the tango began in brothels and wharf-rats skewered each other for the love of a good dancer (sex and death, again). </p> <p>The secret of the pampas - the almost unimaginably flat, yawning grasslands where eight million cattle are suitably prepared for their eventual role in the kitchen by spending their days in one vast smooth pan - is to stop. Driving endlessly through the pampas is, frankly, boring. Stop, however, and you will hear the birds, and the water, and smell the clear air and the eucalyptus. Best of all is to stop at a ranch for a night or so, as we did at the elegant <a href=\"http://www.estancialajosefina.com.ar\">Estancia La Josefina</a>, about 150 km south of the capital, there to sit and breathe in one long bucolic sigh. Tiny puppies played gently beneath the legs of our horses as we rode grass tracks with the so-dapper gauchos, later returning to feast outside on about 17 differently delicious barbe cued cuts of the farm's own beef. A soft wind blowing in the trees above was all there was to remind us that time had not stopped. </p> <p>Which made San Carlos de Bariloche a shock. We had seen so much, learnt so much, of Argentina that this new diversity shouldn't have surprised; but, still, landing suddenly in Heidi's home town a day later raised a few (half-frozen) eyebrows. Snowy fjords, icy waterfalls, gay wooden chalets and welcoming hot chocolate emporiums ... finding the Tyrol in northern Patagonia was odd. It was almost a delight, being another glimpse of this rivetingly different country. But for me, there was a touch too much history; this was where Martin Bormann and Erich Priebke hid until taken by Mossad, and a certain red-cheeked Teutonic hand-rubbing cheerfulness to its Christmassy tweeness, made it seem simply too foreign, too many miles from the land's own history, from its unruly Mediterranean passions, from its heroic tales of Simon Bolivar and Jos\u00e9 de San Martin and Manuel Belgrano, from all the sex and all the death. </p> <p>Still, our hotel, the fairly magnificent Llao Llao, would be a wonderful way to relax with spas and golf and apres-ski comfort if you were that way inclined, and the surroundings are fabulous, tugging the heart further down into Patagonia, towards the near-mystical Tierra del Fuego. Next trip, perhaps.

      "body": "<p>Hi Sam, </p> <p>I'm just back from working in <strong>Washington DC</strong> for a few months. It's a great city to explore - I hope the following tips help.</p> <p>Visit the Kennedy Center - a massive performing arts venue built in memory of JFK. There's a free \"Millennium Stages\" concert there every night at 6pm, and you can tour the centre itself during the day. Some of the concerts are great - international artists as well as the national symphony orchestra have played there as part of the season. It's right by Watergate as well, and offers an unrivalled view of the city from the roof. Take the metro to Foggy Bottom, where a free shuttle bus will pick you up and deliver you to the centre's door. From there, head back to Capitol Hill (Union Station metro on the red line). The Union Station food court - right next to the metro - offers a variety of food that'll keep you going for the rest of the day.</p> <p>After refuelling, head towards the Capitol and walk straight down the mall to the Lincoln Memorial - a long walk, but it's worth it. You'll pass joggers, (sorry - you're trying to get away from them!), but it's a great place to see people enjoy the city. Along the way, stop in at the Smithsonian Museums which line the Mall. The best are Natural History and American History (get there early for a ticket for the American Presidency exhibition). Air and Space is the most popular museum in the world, but its exhibits look a little tired now. Watch out - the museums close at 5.30, so don't miss them. The Newseum in Arlington (Rosslyn Metro) is great - with very up to date exhibits on how the media screwed up its election coverage, and like all museums in the area, it's free. And if you're interested in the press, call the Washington Post to arrange a tour - they only offer them on Mondays. You'll get to see the newsroom, and hear a little bit about the history of the place. It's also free. You can also take a tour of the Pentagon, the FBI building and the White House, all of which are worthwhile if you have the time.</p> <p>At night, head for Georgetown - a taxi to M and Wisconsin streets is your best bet - the metro is a bit of a hike. Try Paparazzi, on Wisconsin, for a more expensive drink. Then just carry on down to M street till you find other bars to knock around in. Mr Smith's has a live pianist who leads the assembled throng in a sing-a-long at the weekends, with a band upstairs. There's even a British bar - The Guards - should you get a bit homesick. And during the day Georgetown offers good shopping, and it's a beautiful walk along the canal which runs parallel to M Street.</p> <p>Adams Morgan is also a good bet for nightlife.

      "bodyText": "Hi Sam, I'm just back from working in Washington DC for a few months. It's a great city to explore - I hope the following tips help. Visit the Kennedy Center - a massive performing arts venue built in memory of JFK. There's a free \"Millennium Stages\" concert there every night at 6pm, and you can tour the centre itself during the day. Some of the concerts are great - international artists as well as the national symphony orchestra have played there as part of the season. It's right by Watergate as well, and offers an unrivalled view of the city from the roof. Take the metro to Foggy Bottom, where a free shuttle bus will pick you up and deliver you to the centre's door. From there, head back to Capitol Hill (Union Station metro on the red line). The Union Station food court - right next to the metro - offers a variety of food that'll keep you going for the rest of the day. After refuelling, head towards the Capitol and walk straight down the mall to the Lincoln Memorial - a long walk, but it's worth it. You'll pass joggers, (sorry - you're trying to get away from them!), but it's a great place to see people enjoy the city. Along the way, stop in at the Smithsonian Museums which line the Mall. The best are Natural History and American History (get there early for a ticket for the American Presidency exhibition). Air and Space is the most popular museum in the world, but its exhibits look a little tired now. Watch out - the museums close at 5.30, so don't miss them. The Newseum in Arlington (Rosslyn Metro) is great - with very up to date exhibits on how the media screwed up its election coverage, and like all museums in the area, it's free. And if you're interested in the press, call the Washington Post to arrange a tour - they only offer them on Mondays. You'll get to see the newsroom, and hear a little bit about the history of the place. It's also free. You can also take a tour of the Pentagon, the FBI building and the White House, all of which are worthwhile if you have the time. At night, head for Georgetown - a taxi to M and Wisconsin streets is your best bet - the metro is a bit of a hike. Try Paparazzi, on Wisconsin, for a more expensive drink. Then just carry on down to M street till you find other bars to knock around in. Mr Smith's has a live pianist who leads the assembled throng in a sing-a-long at the weekends, with a band upstairs. There's even a British bar - The Guards - should you get a bit homesick. And during the day Georgetown offers good shopping, and it's a beautiful walk along the canal which runs parallel to M Street. Adams Morgan is also a good bet for nightlife. Try Tryst on Columbia Road for a relaxed beer - but it does get crowded at peak times. Always carry your passport if you want to get into a bar - they are very strict about ID in America. You have to be over 21 to drink, but if you look under 30 they WILL ask you for proof of your age. And nothing but a passport or a US driver's licence works. And be prepared to talk about politics all night - everyone in DC, be they a journalist, lawyer or poltiical staffer, talks about it all night in the bars - especially at the moment. Wrap up warmly - it's freezing out there!

This week, I was hacking my way through the Florida swampland known as the Office of Secretary of State Katherine Harris and found a couple thousand more names of voters electronically 'disappeared' from the vote rolls. About half of those named are African-Americans. They had the right to vote, but they never made it to the balloting booths. </p> <p>When we left off our Florida story two weeks ago, The Observer discovered that Harris's office had ordered the elimination of 8,000 Florida voters on the grounds that they had committed felonies in other states. None had. Harris bought the bum list from a company called ChoicePoint, a firm whose Atlanta executive suite and boardroom are filled with Republican funders. ChoicePoint, we have learned, picked up the list of faux felons from state officials in - ahem - Texas. In fact, it was a roster of people who, like their Governor, George W, had committed nothing more than misdemeanours. </p> <p>For Harris, Florida Governor Jeb Bush and his brother, the Texas blacklist was a mistake made in Heaven. Most of those targeted to have their names 'scrubbed' from the voter roles were African-Americans, Hispanics and poor white folk, likely voters for Vice-President Gore. We don't know how many voters lost their citizenship rights before the error was discovered by a few sceptical county officials, before ChoicePoint, which has gamely 'fessed-up to the Texas-sized error, produced a new list of 58,000 felons. In May, Harris sent on the new, improved scrub sheets to the county election boards. Maybe it's my bad attitude, but I thought it worthwhile to check out the new list. Sleuthing around county offices with a team of researchers from internet newspaper Salon.com, we discovered that the 'correct' list wasn't so correct. </p> <p>One elections supervisor, Linda Howell of Madison County, was so upset by the errors that she refused to use the Harris/ChoicePoint list. How could she be so sure the new list identified innocent people as felons? Because her own name was on it, 'and I assure you, I am not a felon'. </p> <p>Our 10-county review suggests a minimum 15 per cent misidentification rate. That makes another 7,000 innocent people accused of crimes and stripped of their citizenship rights in the run-up to the presidential race. And not just any 7,000 people. Hillsborough (Tampa) county statisticians found that 54 per cent of the names on the scrub list belonged to African-Americans, who voted 93 per cent for Gore. </p> <p>Now our team, diving deeper into the swamps, has discovered yet a third group whose voting rights were stripped. The ChoicePoint-generated list includes 1,704 names of people who, earlier in their lives, were convicted of felonies in Illinois and Ohio. Like most American states, these two restore citizenship rights to people who have served their time in prison and then remained on the good side of the law. </p> <p>Florida strips those convicted in its own courts of voting rights for life. But Harris's office concedes, and county officials concur, that the state of Florida has no right to impose this penalty on people who have moved in from these other states. (Only 13 states, most in the Old Confederacy, bar reformed criminals from voting.) </p> <p>Going deeper into the Harris lists, we find hundreds more convicts from the 35 other states which restored their rights at the end of sentences served. If they have the right to vote, why were these citizens barred from the polls? Harris didn't return my calls. But Alan Dershowitz did. The Harvard law professor, a renowned authority on legal process, said: 'What's emerging is a pattern of reducing the total number of voters in Florida, which they know will reduce the Democratic vote.' </p> <p>How could Florida's Republican rulers know how these people would vote? I put the question to David Bositis, America's top expert on voting demographics. Once he stopped laughing, he said the way Florida used the lists from a private firm was, 'an obvious technique to discriminate against black voters'. In a darker mood, Bositis, of Washington's Center for Political and Economic Studies, said the sad truth of American justice is that 46 per cent of those convicted of felony are African-American. In Florida, a record number of black folk, over 80 per cent of those registered to vote, packed the polling booths on November 7. Behind the curtains, nine out of 10 black people voted Gore. </p> <p>Mark Mauer of the Sentencing Project, Washington, pointed out that the 'white' half of the purge list would be peopled overwhelmingly by the poor, also solid Democratic voters. </p> <p>Add it up. The dead-wrong Texas list, the uncorrected 'corrected' list, plus the out-of-state ex-con list. By golly, it's enough to swing a presidential election. I bet the busy Harris, simultaneously in charge of both Florida's voter rolls and George Bush's presidential campaign, never thought of that. </p> <p>But enough is never enough, it seems. We have discovered a fourth group of Gore voters also barred from the polls. </p> <p>It was Thursday, 2am. On the other end of the line, heavy breathing, then a torrent too fast for me to catch it all. 'Vile... lying... inaccurate... pack of nonsense... riddled with errors'... click! This was not a ChoicePoint whistleblower telling me about the company's notorious list. It was ChoicePoint's own media communications representative, Marty Fagan, communicating with me about my, 'sleazy disgusting journalism' in reporting on it. </p> <p>I was curious about this company that appears - although never say never in this game - to have chosen the next President for America's voters. Its board dazzles with Republican stars, including billionaire Ken Langone and Home Depot tycoon Bernard Marcus, big Republican funders. </p> <p>Florida is the only state to hire an outside firm to suggest who should lose citizenship rights. That may change. 'Given a new President, and what we accomplished in Florida, we expect to roll across the nation,' ChoicePoint told me ominously. </p> <p>They have quite a pedigree for this solemn task. The company's Florida subsidiary, Database Technologies (now DBT Online), was founded by one Hank Asher. When US law enforcement agencies alleged that he may have been associated with Bahamian drug dealers - although no charges were brought - the company lost its data management contract with the FBI. Hank and his friends left last year and so, in Florida's eyes, the past is forgiven. </p> <p>Thursday, 3am. (I should say both calls were at my request). A new, gentler voice giving me ChoicePoint's upbeat spin. 'You say we got over 15 per cent wrong - we like to look at that as up to 85 per cent right!' That's 7,000 votes-plus - the bulk Democrats, not to mention the thousands on the Texas list. Gore may lose by 500 votes. </p> <p>I contacted San Francisco-based expert Mark Swedlund. 'It's just fundamental industry practice that you don't roll out the list statewide until you have tested it and tested it again,' he said. 'Dershowitz is right: they had to know that this jeopardised thousands of people's registrations. And they would also know the [racial] profile of those voters.' </p> <p> 'They' is Florida state, not ChoicePoint. Let's not get confused where the blame lies. Harris's crew lit this database fuse, then acted surprised when it blew up. Swedlund says ChoicePoint had a professional responsibility to tell the state to test the list; ChoicePoint says the state should not have used its 'raw' data. </p> <p> Until Florida privatised its Big Brother powers, laws kept the process out in the open. This year, when one county asked to see ChoicePoint's formulas and back-up for blacklisting voters, they refused - these were commercial secrets. So we'll never know how America's president was chosen. </p> <p>ChoicePoint complains that I said Harris signed their contract. It was a Beth Emory. I'm still more than 85 per cent accurate. </p> <p><br><a href=\"mailto:gregory.palast@observer.co.uk\">gregory.palast@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

I was curious about this company that appears - although never say never in this game - to have chosen the next President for America's voters. Its board dazzles with Republican stars, including billionaire Ken Langone and Home Depot tycoon Bernard Marcus, big Republican funders. Florida is the only state to hire an outside firm to suggest who should lose citizenship rights. That may change. 'Given a new President, and what we accomplished in Florida, we expect to roll across the nation,' ChoicePoint told me ominously. They have quite a pedigree for this solemn task. The company's Florida subsidiary, Database Technologies (now DBT Online), was founded by one Hank Asher. When US law enforcement agencies alleged that he may have been associated with Bahamian drug dealers - although no charges were brought - the company lost its data management contract with the FBI. Hank and his friends left last year and so, in Florida's eyes, the past is forgiven. Thursday, 3am. (I should say both calls were at my request). A new, gentler voice giving me ChoicePoint's upbeat spin. 'You say we got over 15 per cent wrong - we like to look at that as up to 85 per cent right!' That's 7,000 votes-plus - the bulk Democrats, not to mention the thousands on the Texas list. Gore may lose by 500 votes. I contacted San Francisco-based expert Mark Swedlund. 'It's just fundamental industry practice that you don't roll out the list statewide until you have tested it and tested it again,' he said. 'Dershowitz is right: they had to know that this jeopardised thousands of people's registrations. And they would also know the [racial] profile of those voters.' 'They' is Florida state, not ChoicePoint. Let's not get confused where the blame lies. Harris's crew lit this database fuse, then acted surprised when it blew up. Swedlund says ChoicePoint had a professional responsibility to tell the state to test the list; ChoicePoint says the state should not have used its 'raw' data. Until Florida privatised its Big Brother powers, laws kept the process out in the open. This year, when one county asked to see ChoicePoint's formulas and back-up for blacklisting voters, they refused - these were commercial secrets. So we'll never know how America's president was chosen. ChoicePoint complains that I said Harris signed their contract. It was a Beth Emory. I'm still more than 85 per cent accurate. gregory.palast@observer.co.uk",

Another man, an art teacher in a backwoods town, showed me the reams of paper on which his poems were kept. And on Navarin Island, the southernmost place in the world with a permanent settlement, I came across a farmhand who lived alone in a shanty 30 miles from the island's only town, brewing tea, frying pancakes and writing poems. </p> <p>Some of the recurrent themes of Chilean poetry are solitude, the fragile and beautiful landscape, and the brutal wars waged by the Spanish against the Mapuche Amerindians.

Built on seven hills, with winding cobbled streets housing ornate Italian mansions and rundown tenements in equal measure, this is one of the most extraordinary cities in Latin America. The hills are so steep that there are numerous funicular lifts rising from the commercial heart into the warren of the upper town, where you will find rusting 2CVs and hear tangos and Mexican ranchero music echoing through the narrow streets. The houses tend to be tall and brightly painted, and the streets create such a maze that even locals get hopelessly lost. On a clear day, you can see Aconcagua, the highest mountain in the Americas. </p> <p>Such a romantic and contradictory place as Valpara\u00edso was bound to appeal to Neruda and, in the last decade of his life, he bought a house here. Brightly painted and filled with almost as many artefacts as Isla Negra, La Sebastiana echoed the organised chaos of Valpara\u00edso itself.

Awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971, he was diagnosed with cancer shortly afterwards. As a lifelong communist and friend of President Allende, Pinochet's coup and Allende's death in September 1973 was more than he could bear, and Neruda died in Santiago two weeks later.

The Latin American equivalent of Bath, it takes all the things we expect to find in Mexico - the colours, the churches, the markets, the pre-Hispanic temples, the music and the food - and wraps them in a small package surrounded by cactus-covered hills. It even has its own answer to the Roman Baths, the ancient Zapotec capital of Monte Alban. </p> <p>It's difficult to talk about Oaxaca without lapsing into clich\u00e9; so difficult in fact that I'm not even going to try. As the guidebooks tell you, it is a quaint town of cobbled streets and rainbow-coloured buildings, where you can buy Indian crafts at bustling markets, and be serenaded at dinner by a wandering mariachi band. I'm sorry but it's true. And if that hasn't put you off, here are a few suggestions on how to spend your time. </p> <p>Start your day with a coffee in the Z\u00f3calo. This large and shady square is the heart of the city. Sit for long enough in one of the pavement cafes and most of Oaxaca will come to you - usually with something to sell. The Zocalo's bandstand, fountains and benches are a magnet for tourists, begging children, canoodling teenagers, shoe-shine boys (no, my Reeboks don't need polishing thank you), pigeons and street vendors wrestling with improbably large bunches of silver balloons. </p> <p>Mornings are for markets and Oaxaca has plenty of these. Head for one of the covered markets specialising in local crafts or take your chances at the mammoth Mercado de Abastos. Traders will instinctively know that you are not really there to buy one of their bright yellow cornfed chickens complete with trailing giblets, or a birdcage, a bag of fried grasshoppers ( chapulines - the local speciality) or indeed anything for that matter, though anything is what they seem to do best here. One wrong turn and you could be lost forever among the piles of fat chilli peppers, cactus leaves, racks of CDs, vast tubs of cocoa beans, nuts and leather belts. Every so often you will encounter a mill where a selection of the above ingredients are taken to be ground into a mole (a paste for making the distinctive local sauces, not a small underground creature). </p> <p>Time for a quick lunch - do as the locals do and opt for some tacos filled with pork, chicken or quesillo , the local stringy cheese - before heading up to Monte Alban. A 20-minute bus ride from the centre, this hilltop site was once the administrative and religious capital for the Zapotec people who lived here from about 500BC to AD600. The stones and the setting are atmospheric enough but the trip will be even more rewarding if you, or your guide, know that the terrace is where the sacrificial altar used to be, the strange hieroglyphs with their upside down heads celebrate the conquest of surrounding peoples, and the arrow-shaped building is known as the Observatory for its alignment with the sun and stars. </p> <p>They throw you out at six but hang on until the last moment to savour the feeling of having this magical spot to yourself. As the sun goes down and the crowds leave, the wind picks up and bats start to circle. </p> <p>This visit will have raised more questions than it answers making a visit to the Centro Cultural Santo Domingo the logical next stop. Housed in a former convent, this excellent museum tells the history of Oaxaca and its people through artifacts ranging from pre-Hispanic fertility symbols to furniture brought by the Spanish conquistadors. Most people make a beeline for Room 3 with its display of gold, silver, pearl and bones unearthed from the tomb of one of Monte Alban's great leaders. </p> <p>A visit to the church of Santo Domingo next door will show that the Spanish so-called 'conquest' was always more of a process of compromise. The images of Christ on the cross are particularly gruesome - apparently the only way the Spanish could get the indigenous population to accept the story of the crucifixion was by presenting it as a bloody human sacrifice - a notion they would have been quite comfortable with. Similarly, the large squares in front of Oaxaca's churches stem from the Indians' refusal to enter temples - many of the original services would have been held outside the front door. </p> <p>Your day will probably end where it began - in the Z\u00f3calo, this time with a bottle of Sol or a tequila. The Indian women will be selling gardenias and spicy tamales and a man who looks strangely familiar will try and sell you the rug you said no to that morning.</p>",

      "body": "<p> Little has changed since Mark Twain steamed down the R\u00edo San Juan 144 years ago. For the time being, Nicaragua's environment remains unspoilt, boasting the largest remaining rainforest north of the Amazon, which covers 17 per cent of the country. Eager to separate truth from fiction, we followed in Twain's footsteps, starting our voyage at the port of San Carlos, a scrappy, muddy town on Lake Nicaragua. </p> <p>The quickest way to get to get to San Carlos these days is to fly from Managua. La Costu\u00f1a airlines have a daily service for \u00a357 return. But, while it may be quick, it's not for the nervous. Still, a splendid view of volcanoes and lakes from the minuscule 16-seater plane compensates for the fear factor. Sort of. Forty-five nerve-wracking minutes later, we landed on a runway that resembled an Irish country road, a sticky mess of muck and stones. </p> <p>San Carlos, a port town of 35,000, was almost wiped-out by a major fire during the 1978-1979 revolution and has never recovered fully. The streets are unpaved, and houses, jeeps, children, roosters and pigs are all coated in mud. Russian jeeps - Sandinista relics - ferried us to the waterside where we were to begin our journey along the R\u00edo San Juan, Central America's second longest river, by 'panga' or motorised canoe. </p> <p>In Travels With Mr Brown, Twain records his journey into the heart of the Nicaraguan jungle. Not being quite so brave, we were going to the Reserva Bi\u00f3logica Indio-Ma\u00edz. Echoing Twain, we steamed down to El Castillo and saw the same fortress, a 'stately old adobe castle' he had visited. According to Twain: 'There is a dangerous rapid here. It is said to be artificial - formed by man in former times to keep the pirate boats from penetrating the interior. We had to climb ashore here, walk around the rapids, and get on another steam wheeler.' </p> <p>Our driver, Ricardo, was more skilful than his historical counterpart. He managed to steer us over the rapids, a turbulent ride that rocked the boat roughly from side to side, bringing to mind the crocodiles and sharks that live in these parts. </p> <p>We continued down the river, enchanted by the forest. It is still an unspoilt jungle - some of the most pristine rainforest in the world. Yet its days may be numbered as plans are afoot to build Nicaragua's answer to the Panama Canal. . </p> <p>For now, it retains its magnificence. A mist hung over the river and cedar, mahogany and almond trees surpassed heights more usually associated with skyscrapers. Our lodgings for the night, the Refugio Bartelo, stood at the point where the R\u00edo Bartelo converges with the R\u00edo San Juan. </p> <p>The sleeping accommodation was a wooden block of rooms with vaulted, high ceilings and en suite bathrooms. Mine contained a double bed, bunk beds and a few shelves. Mosquito nets are provided, but repellent is a must. There are no windows, just shutters that are closed at dusk. A generator powers a dim electric light. In the guestbook, I found this comment from Debra, a traveller from the USA: 'I like the tiny frog from the forest and the bat in my room at night.' </p> <p>The garden is full of tropical flowers, the type that cost \u00a320 a stem in London. Proof, if it were needed, that money can't buy everything for the strays in London don't attract feeding humming birds. A pet spider monkey, Daniella, a rescued orphan, roams around making eyes at men but growling at women. </p> <p> Our fellow guests were Mexican scientists studying a species of river lobster. In a recent one-month study, biologists discovered every species of Central American animal within three kilometres of the Refugio, including jaguars, spider, howler and white-faced monkeys, three-toed sloths, six types of kingfisher, and 11 types of humming bird. </p> <p>Although the rainy season was over, a freak hurricane in Venezeula brought heavy rain, scuppering our plans for a long afternoon walk in the rainforest. We resorted to plan B - spending the afternoon lounging around in the Rancho - a large veranda-like structure, a thatched roof on stilts. Hammocks were suspended around its perimeter, overlooking the swelling river, the Nicaraguan rainforest on our side and the Costa Rican jungle on the other bank. There was nothing for it but to take to the hammocks and drink beer. </p> <p>The next morning we were afloat again, bound for the 36-Island archipelago of Solentiname, the 'Sacred Islands' of Lake Nicaragua. The freak rain continued, so we bedded down under massive binliners, leaving only our faces exposed. We glided along for about four hours before entering Lake Nicaragua. For lunch we stopped at Isla La Venada, or Deer Island. The comida corriente of chicken, fish, rice, beans, cabbage and tomato salad and pineapple rice water cost 20 Cordobas, about \u00a31 each. </p> <p>William Urroz, el Patr\u00f3n of the Rancho restaurant, moved here 12 years ago to introduce new plants - coffee, avocado, lemon, lime and oranges - and organic methods to the fertile island. He has since branched out and now farms crocodiles and turtles, not for consumption but for stock regeneration. The crocodiles are 'free range' he explained - no swimming, then. On Sunday, the only day of rest for most Nicaraguans, a neighbour, sweet but somewhat the worse for wear, swung gently in a hammock, making slurred conversation. He explained himself. 'Hoy, ron. Mana\u00f1a, machete' - 'Today, rum. Tomorrow, machete.' The machete is the all-round tool of choice for most men in the rural areas of Nicaragua. </p> <p>It brought to mind a passage from The Jaguar Smile , Salman Rushdie's book about his journey to Nicaragua in 1986: 'The campesinos ... were familiar with the workings of the AK-47 automatic rifle. They were also geniuses with the machete. The campesino who had hacked to pieces the tree that held us up could have shaved you without breaking the skin. Alternatively, he could have sliced you like a loaf.' </p> <p>Rushdie says that The Jaguar Smile 'now reads like a period piece, a fairy tale of one of the hottest moments of the cold war'. Those were the days of the communist Sandinista's fierce battle against the Ronald Reagan-funded Contras. The bad Nicaragua of the headlines has stuck in most people's minds, even though the country has been at peace for 10 years. . And if it's not war, it's weather. Hurricane Mitch struck in 1998, killing 2,200 Nicaraguans. Then there are the earthquakes. </p> <p>Yet the real Nicaragua is the place that lies behind the headlines. A land of smoking volcanoes, warm tropical nights, hammocks and rocking chairs and Flor de Ca\u00f1a rum, a place of waters and wilds, but also of elegant colonial cities such as L\u00e9on with its cathedrals and fading Sandanista murals, and Granada, the oldest city in Latin America, and the place I dream of returning to: the city where I would spend my honeymoon.</p> <p><strong>Getting there</strong></p> <p>Sandra Jordan travelled around Nicaragua with <a href=\"http://www.toursnicaragua.com\">Tours Nicaragua</a>. Their 14 night/15 day 'Discover Nicaragua' trip, taking in colonial cities, markets, historical sites, jungles, cloud forests, volcanoes and beaches can be booked in the UK through Pura Aventura, cost \u00a31,954.

On Sunday, the only day of rest for most Nicaraguans, a neighbour, sweet but somewhat the worse for wear, swung gently in a hammock, making slurred conversation. He explained himself. 'Hoy, ron. Mana\u00f1a, machete' - 'Today, rum. Tomorrow, machete.' The machete is the all-round tool of choice for most men in the rural areas of Nicaragua. It brought to mind a passage from The Jaguar Smile , Salman Rushdie's book about his journey to Nicaragua in 1986: 'The campesinos ... were familiar with the workings of the AK-47 automatic rifle. They were also geniuses with the machete. The campesino who had hacked to pieces the tree that held us up could have shaved you without breaking the skin. Alternatively, he could have sliced you like a loaf.' Rushdie says that The Jaguar Smile 'now reads like a period piece, a fairy tale of one of the hottest moments of the cold war'. Those were the days of the communist Sandinista's fierce battle against the Ronald Reagan-funded Contras. The bad Nicaragua of the headlines has stuck in most people's minds, even though the country has been at peace for 10 years. . And if it's not war, it's weather. Hurricane Mitch struck in 1998, killing 2,200 Nicaraguans. Then there are the earthquakes. Yet the real Nicaragua is the place that lies behind the headlines. A land of smoking volcanoes, warm tropical nights, hammocks and rocking chairs and Flor de Ca\u00f1a rum, a place of waters and wilds, but also of elegant colonial cities such as L\u00e9on with its cathedrals and fading Sandanista murals, and Granada, the oldest city in Latin America, and the place I dream of returning to: the city where I would spend my honeymoon.

The first was that after being questioned by police she was charged with stealing a bottle of gin and driving while over the limit. The second took a little longer. But last week, though the case went against her, she made legal history.</p> <p>Five judges from England and Scotland sitting on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ruled that when police that night asked her whether she was the driver of the car in question, they did not infringe the European Convention on Human Rights, now enshrined in domestic law.</p> <p>And the judges used this new judicial machinery to settle promptly an issue that had threatened to bring chaos to the prosecution of drink driving offences throughout the United Kingdom.</p> <p>With the approach of Christmas their ruling was welcomed by police and road safety organisations. Until last year the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council seemed a relic of empire, dealing largely with cases from the Commonwealth. Much of its most contentious business in recent times has concerned appeals against the death penalty in the Caribbean. It also hears appeals from professionals such as doctors or dentists convicted of misconduct.</p> <p>But the late Donald Dewar saw the need to make sure that devolution did not produce quixotic results in various parts of the UK. Last year the committee began to emerge as an incipient UK constitutional court to regulate the relationship between Westminster and the new legislative bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. So far it has been concerned with cases arising under the convention, by which the Scottish Parliament and Executive have been bound since their inception last year. The convention became part of UK law in October under the Human Rights Act.</p> <p>Last week the five judges unanimously found that Miss Brown's right to a fair trial under the convention had not been compromised by the question about who was driving the car which the police had asked her under section 172(2)(a) of the Road Traffic Act 1988. They thus rejected the view of the High Court in Scotland that her answer - 'it was me' - was self-incriminating.</p> <p>Lord Bingham, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, said there had to be a fair balance between the general interests of the community - which justified measures against drinking and driving - and the personal rights of the individual.</p> <p>The judges also settled a question debated in previous cases. They confirmed that the Lord Advocate's actions as public prosecutor and a member of the Scottish Executive could raise 'devolution issues'.</p> <p>These are acts of the Scottish Parliament or the Executive which can be tested in court if their competency under statute or their compliance with the convention are in doubt.</p> <p>Last week, as staff restored the peers' chamber to normal after the state opening of Parliament, Lord Hope of Craighead, who delivered one of the leading judgments in the case of Brown, explained that while the Privy Council's ruling was not necessarily final - it could be challenged either in London or Strasbourg - it would be influential.</p> <p>In previous cases the English judges on the Privy Council have been reluctant to recognise 'devolution issues', probably from a reluctance to interfere in the processes of Scottish criminal law.</p> <p>But the case of Miss Brown has changed their view. Lord Hope said: 'I think one might almost say that the scales fell from the eyes of the judges when they realised that the system we'd been given is a very efficient one for dealing with [certain] problems in the quickest and most economical way possible.'</p> <p>Before devolution, he said, there was a right of appeal from the Court of Session in Scotland in civil but not in criminal cases which had always been regarded as 'beyond the scope of the Union'. Now there was a route of appeal, over 'devolution issues' only, to the Privy Council.</p> <p>Although it was, he conceded, a 'slightly odd arrangement', the Privy Council had several advantages. It wasn't part of Westminster and its judges didn't have to be from the House of Lords but could come from a wider pool of senior figures from UK courts.</p> <p>'It's also possible for the Judicial Committee to move around in a way the House of Lords can't really do. It is in theory possible for the Privy Council to hear cases in Edinburgh, Cardiff or Belfast.'</p> <p>He continued: 'There's a feeling that, given that we can actually find time to do it, we'd quite like to be able to be seen to be participating in our function more visibly to the public.'</p> <p>In practice, though, the judges who sat on the Privy Council were mainly judges who sat in the House of Lords. 'That may seem a bit of a charade, really, just as if you were changing your hat by moving from one place to another, but it has an advantage that one wants if possible to avoid a disagreement between the House of Lords in English cases and the Privy Council sitting in Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish cases.'</p> <p>The case of Brown, he said, showed that a definitive judgment could be achieved more quickly than by taking the case through the judicial processes of each country.</p> <p>'It's a matter of equal concern north and south of the border as to what the position is under human rights if somebody's asked by a police officer to name the driver of the motor car,' he said.</p> <p>The Privy Council verdict was open to challenge, either in the Court of Appeal in England, the House of Lords or by individual petition to Strasbourg. But he continued: 'I suspect that there will be fairly strong feeling in the Court of Appeal in England, which I can't speak for, not to grant leave to appeal to the House of Lords against their decision in view of the fact that the Privy Council has already reached a decision ... They would have to persuade the appeal committee in the House of Lords that there was still a point left to be argued.'</p> <p>As for Strasbourg, he said: 'We've yet to find out what the result would be when the Strasbourg court places greater weight on views brought to bear by the judges of the highest level in this country. What we've tried to do is understand the Strasbourg jurisprudence. We believe that the decision in Brown is consistent with the Strasbourg jurisprudence and therefore would survive challenge. But in theory that route is open.'</p> <p>Early next year the Privy Council will hear a case arising from the conviction at Paisley in June last year of Robert McIntosh for drug trafficking. The prosecutor then applied for an order under the Misuse of Drugs Act confiscating his assets. The High Court in Scotland found that this violated McIntosh's right, under the convention, to a presumption of innocence.</p> <p>This case, too, said Lord Hope last week, not only involved a matter of concern on both sides of the border but also an issue reserved to Westminster. It had been dealt with in Scotland before England because the devolution legislation took effect before the Human Rights Act. The appeal to the Privy Council would be heard before an appeal could reach the House of Lords from the Court of Appeal.</p> <p>He continued: 'So again the Scottish position is being used as a test-bed to decide the issue on both sides of the border.'</p> <p>However, Lord Hope is anxious that the Privy Council should not become involved in pronouncing on Scottish criminal law or criminal practice. Its strength was that it had been able to develop its own system without English influence.</p> <p>He said: 'I see a great deal of English law as operated in the Caribbean and my own preference is that we adhere to our own practices and our own law. It's a very fine line between dealing with a strict devolution issue point and becoming involved in Scottish criminal practice or Scottish substantive criminal law.'</p> <p>During the devolution debates in 1998 Lord Hope expressed anxieties that the Scottish public, in their enthusiasm for devolution, did not understand that the new parliament would not be sovereign, like Westminster, but open to review.</p> <p>Last week he said: 'You may remember that Tony Blair said in an unguarded moment that the powers were similar to those of a parish council, and that caused a lot of unease.

The typical position in Europe and the Commonwealth was that parliaments were subject to review. 'Scotland has moved, as it were, into the 21st century by having a parliament which is the same as everywhere else in the world.'</p> <p>The devolution settlement had produced a lopsided result. England was a uniform country with no attempt to divide it into regions. 'And then you have Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland with a devolution system and a uniform appeals structure.'</p> <p>He added: 'To that extent, in a loose sense, you might say that the Privy Council is a kind of constitutional court, although we're again a long way from a typical constitutional court.'</p> <p>Lord Hope, the former Lord President who was appointed a Lord in Ordinary in 1996, expected the number of human rights cases would eventually fall after the 'initial wave' had passed.</p> <p>But he continued: 'If one finds that the government changes or the political complexion alters a bit, one may find a greater tension between Edinburgh and Westminster than exists at the moment.

The case of Brown, he said, showed that a definitive judgment could be achieved more quickly than by taking the case through the judicial processes of each country.

Nevertheless, it is an extraordinary place: the densest rain-forest with the most diverse flora and fauna of any jungle in the world. The centre for most tours is Manaus, a city of over 2 million people where you can arrange to visit several smaller Amazonian tributaries and the largest riverine archipelago in the world.</p> <p><strong> 2 Maraj\u00f3</strong><br> Near the mouth of the Amazon, this is the world's largest river island. Home to crocodiles, water buffalo, boa constrictors and wonderful beaches, it is an idyllic spot to relax after the rigours of a jungle trip.</p> <p><strong> 3 Fortaleza Beaches</strong><br> The beaches near the northern city of Fortaleza (in Cear\u00e1 State) are among the most beautiful in Brazil.</p> <p><strong> 4 The Sertao</strong><br> Inland from Recife and Bahia, you come to Brazil's badlands, the Sert\u00e3o. This is a region of dry hills, scrub and breathtaking views, providing a relatively peaceful and unexpected glimpse of rural Brazil.</p> <p><strong> 5 Brasilia</strong><br> Although many visitors find Brasilia a little soulless, it has to be on the list of top ten places in Brazil, simply because of its extraordinary architecture. The city is laid out in the shape of a bow and arrow, according to the winning design in a competition set by President Kubitschek in 1956.</p> <p><strong> 6 Rio de Janeiro</strong><br> Whatever you think of the hype, Rio is unquestionably a great city. A string of pearly white beaches, mountains thick with jungle and the 710-metre high Corcovado mountain crowned with the statue of Christ are just the most obvious of its attractions. The bohemian district of Santa Teresa has some very atmospheric colonial architecture, the Botanical Gardens are among the best in Latin America, and the surroundings provide some great excursions, especially to Parat\u00ed and Teres\u00f3polis.</p> <p><strong> 7 The Pantanal</strong><br> The Amazon may be more famous, but the Pantanal is probably a better bet for wildlife enthusiasts. This is a vast expanse of wetlands set near several major rivers, where you can see 650 species of birds, 230 species of fish, anteaters, armadillos, pumas, deer, caymans and yellow anacondas.</p> <p><strong> 8 The train to Bolivia</strong><br> It may seem strange to recommend a train ride, but this is unquestionably one of the most memorable journeys anywhere in Latin America. Leaving the dusty town of Campo Grande, the train makes for the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra via the border town of Corumb\u00e1, on a journey which can take three days through deserted wetlands and jungle.</p> <p><strong> 9 The Vaqueiro country near Porto Alegre</strong><br> Porto Alegre is one of Brazil's more prosperous cities, and in the hinterland is the home of Brazil's cowboys, the vaqueiros, who lead a classic ranching lifestyle on sprawling cattle-raising farms which may be more readily associated with Argentina or Uruguay. This is a great area for anyone who loves huge, empty skies and the real country way of living.</p> <p><strong> 10 Igua\u00e7u Falls</strong><br> These tumultuous waterfalls are among the principal reasons that tourists come to Brazil. They are so immense that they can be seen clearly from aircraft passing overhead on the way to Buenos Aires.</p> <p><strong>Ten things you didn't know about Bahia</strong></p> <p>1 Bahia houses one of the most lavish sculptures of Christ anywhere in Latin America. It was made in 1730 by Francisco Xavier das Chagas, a slave with no formal training, and is set apart from other sculptures by its drops of blood, made from whale oil, ox blood, banana resin and 2000 rubies. </p> <p>2 Bahia was the capital of Brazil until 1763.</p> <p>3 The wealth reaped from the sugar and tobacco plantations was so immense that Baia was the second richest city in the Portuguese empire.</p> <p>4 It was at Bahia that Charles Darwin first set foot on South American soil.

      "body": "<p> When Prince Charles visited Uruguay last year, he cracked a joke about corned beef. 'I remember eating it until it came out of my ears,' he told a bemused delegation of Montevidean businessmen. The idea that the postwar royal household might have had trouble getting hold of fresh meat beggars belief, but the Prince meant well. He had already made a faux pas in Argentina with comments on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands, and as an ice-breaker it could have been much worse. </p> <p>The meat processing industry was just one of many trade links between Britain and this small, once-prosperous country on the River Plate. The British brought their industrial know-how to South America in the late nineteenth century, building Uruguay's now defunct railway system, introducing electric trams to the capital Montevideo and crowding the business landscape with import and export firms, utility companies, insurers and banks. Some traces of this economic interdependence remain today: Tienda Inglesa, a supermarket chain founded by Don David Robertson in 1870; a fusty British Society; a golf club that serves high tea; and the ancient British Leyland Royal Tiger buses that still belch and fart their way up and down Montevideo's high street, the Avenida 18 de Julio. </p> <p>And then there's Fray Bentos. It's a place, not just a brand name; a town of 20,000, not a steak and kidney pudding. If Prince Charles's itinerary had allowed it, he might have liked to make the journey 300 km north-west of the capital, to pay homage to the tinned meat he was apparently fed as a boy. For more than a century, a factory in Fray Ben tos processed cows into a myriad of useful and edible products for worldwide export. Originally a German enterprise, the plant was taken over by a British company in the 1920s and subsequently nicknamed El Anglo. </p> <p>The last machines ground to a halt in 1979, and the site has since been converted into a museum and industrial estate. Local historian Eduardo Irigoyen is on hand to guide the curious. 'We get about 2,000 visitors a year,' he says. 'Most of them are German or British - the Germans come for academic reasons, the British get very emotional and say they were raised on corned beef.' </p> <p>Many tourists come to Uruguay to trace cultural and familial links. The population is just 3.2 million, but a flick through the Montevideo phone book shows that its origins can be traced to almost every European country. Benedetti, Cajarville, Giucci, Goldberg, Oxandabarat, Porcezanski, Juan Jackson, Carlos Cash, Don Juan Henderson and Guillermo Brown - the last four sounding like a quartet of modern-day gauchos. Waves of immigration during wars or periods of eco nomic depression have created a society that is neither European nor truly Latin American. Uruguayans shop at the local fabrica de pasta, have a world-class pelota team and drink Scotch as if there were no tomorrow. </p> <p>One thing they don't do is eat corned beef. Norberto Bardolli tried it a couple of times during his 40 years at El Anglo, but it's clearly not a memory he savours.

      "bodyText": "When Prince Charles visited Uruguay last year, he cracked a joke about corned beef. 'I remember eating it until it came out of my ears,' he told a bemused delegation of Montevidean businessmen. The idea that the postwar royal household might have had trouble getting hold of fresh meat beggars belief, but the Prince meant well. He had already made a faux pas in Argentina with comments on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands, and as an ice-breaker it could have been much worse. The meat processing industry was just one of many trade links between Britain and this small, once-prosperous country on the River Plate. The British brought their industrial know-how to South America in the late nineteenth century, building Uruguay's now defunct railway system, introducing electric trams to the capital Montevideo and crowding the business landscape with import and export firms, utility companies, insurers and banks. Some traces of this economic interdependence remain today: Tienda Inglesa, a supermarket chain founded by Don David Robertson in 1870; a fusty British Society; a golf club that serves high tea; and the ancient British Leyland Royal Tiger buses that still belch and fart their way up and down Montevideo's high street, the Avenida 18 de Julio. And then there's Fray Bentos. It's a place, not just a brand name; a town of 20,000, not a steak and kidney pudding. If Prince Charles's itinerary had allowed it, he might have liked to make the journey 300 km north-west of the capital, to pay homage to the tinned meat he was apparently fed as a boy. For more than a century, a factory in Fray Ben tos processed cows into a myriad of useful and edible products for worldwide export. Originally a German enterprise, the plant was taken over by a British company in the 1920s and subsequently nicknamed El Anglo. The last machines ground to a halt in 1979, and the site has since been converted into a museum and industrial estate. Local historian Eduardo Irigoyen is on hand to guide the curious. 'We get about 2,000 visitors a year,' he says. 'Most of them are German or British - the Germans come for academic reasons, the British get very emotional and say they were raised on corned beef.' Many tourists come to Uruguay to trace cultural and familial links. The population is just 3.2 million, but a flick through the Montevideo phone book shows that its origins can be traced to almost every European country. Benedetti, Cajarville, Giucci, Goldberg, Oxandabarat, Porcezanski, Juan Jackson, Carlos Cash, Don Juan Henderson and Guillermo Brown - the last four sounding like a quartet of modern-day gauchos. Waves of immigration during wars or periods of eco nomic depression have created a society that is neither European nor truly Latin American. Uruguayans shop at the local fabrica de pasta, have a world-class pelota team and drink Scotch as if there were no tomorrow. One thing they don't do is eat corned beef. Norberto Bardolli tried it a couple of times during his 40 years at El Anglo, but it's clearly not a memory he savours. After the British left, he exchanged Christmas cards with his old foreman Peter King. 'I never had any problems with los ingleses ,' says Bardolli, now aged 76 and still living in the barrio built to house the factory workforce. 'We spent a lot of time together, we even caddied for them on their golf course.' Eduardo and I retrace the steps of the doomed herd; from the crush of the corrales past the disinfecting water jets, along treacherous aerial walkways and paths fortified with cast-iron... to the slaughterhouse.

      "bodyText": "An emergency meeting will take place behind closed doors in Whitehall tomorrow to try to avert a winter crisis in Britain's classrooms that could see pupils sent home. The Observer can reveal that teacher shortages are set to seriously disrupt primary and secondary schools across the country from January. Children may end up at home during school hours, which will affect employers as working parents face childcare difficulties. Schools Minister Estelle Morris will meet representatives from councils to discuss the crisis and devise solutions. These range from four-day weeks in schools and fast-track recruitment, to action to attract teachers from abroad and bring back those who have left the profession. One idea to be discussed is an exchange scheme to guarantee all teachers a year working abroad. The teacher shortage has been slowly building for some time. This year many teachers who normally come from Australia and New Zealand have stayed at home because of the Olympics in Sydney, the millennium celebrations and their countries' own teacher shortages. Research has shown that in London suburbs only 56 per cent of new teacher vacancies are being filled. The study, by Professor Alistair Ross at the Institute for Policy Studies in Education, found schools across 22 London authorities were particularly struggling to find head and deputy heads with just 38 per cent of all posts advertised being filled. The problem is also being felt in Essex, Hampshire, Berkshire, Kent, Blackburn and rural areas of Scotland and Wales. 'This is serious, and we are in for a long-term national crisis,' said Ross. 'It is not confined to London but schools are very good at papering over the cracks because teachers will step in to cover for colleagues.' Last week a memo was sent from the Department of Education to local authorities warning of the possibilities of a four-day week being imposed in some parts of the country. The letter asked local education chiefs to develop emergency strategies to tackle staffing problems. Four schools in the South- east - where the problem is greatest - have already been forced to send children home this term while others have shared one teacher between two classes. In Hampshire, Cherry Card, headteacher of Fernhill county primary school, told parents that unless a teacher can be found in the next few weeks then ten-year-olds will be sent home at noon daily. A Hampshire County Council spokeswoman said rising house prices meant it was increasingly difficult to recruit new teachers. 'We have many vacancies for the spring term,' she said. A spokeswoman at Surrey County Council said internal reorganisation and supply teachers would be filling the gaps in January. Ralph Tabberer, of the Teacher Training Agency, last week announced that the number of places available for those training to be teachers on part-time and flexible programmes will more than double next year to 1,500. Former teacher Ian Penman, now with Timeplan, the UK's biggest teacher recruitment agency, said: Britain has 400,000 teachers in its classrooms and 400,000 trained teachers who are not. I cannot think of another profession where there is such a pool of inactive people.'",

These words were spoken last year by Ann Jones, the wife of former Southampton football manager David Jones. She was describing her husband's reaction to the multiple allegations of sexual abuse he was facing. </p> <p>On Tuesday, in a courtroom packed with expectant journalists, the long nightmare of David Jones, his wife, and their four children, came to an end. One of Britain's most popular football managers walked out of Liverpool Crown Court an innocent man after all charges against him were withdrawn. </p> <p>A week before Jones's trial began, relatively few people understood how any former care worker could possibly be facing more than 20 counts of physical and sexual abuse, all of which were false. But, by the time the trial collapsed on Tuesday, practically every national newspaper knew the explanation. David Jones was a victim of 'trawling' - a form of police investigation which has evolved only in the last 10 years. </p> <p>Much credit for bringing about this transformation in public understanding should go to BBC journalists David Rose and Gary Horne and their Panorama film In the Name of the Children . </p> <p>In the film, which was transmitted on the eve of the Jones trial, and in an article which was published in this newspaper on 26 November, Rose reported on the case of Roy Shuttleworth, a care worker who is serving 10 years in prison for crimes he could not have committed. Shuttleworth, too, was the victim of a trawling operation. </p> <p>In such operations police officers deliberately seek out former residents of care homes and invite them to make complaints. Some of these complaints are true and have helped convict social workers who have indeed betrayed the trust placed in them. </p> <p>But there are clear indications that many of the allegations are false. There is also compelling evidence, some of it captured on film by Panorama, that one of the main motives for fabricating allegations of physical and sexual abuse is money. </p> <p>After Jones's trial collapsed on Tuesday, his solicitor, Stephen Pollard, said that the prosecution witnesses would have been 'utterly discredited' if the case had continued. He said that more witnesses than the defence could possibly use had volunteered to give evidence that the accusations against Jones had been fabricated in order to gain compensation. </p> <p>David Jones was fortunate. As the Shuttleworth case shows, other trials where the evidence indicates that the defendant is innocent have had different outcomes. </p> <p>To investigate such trials is to enter a grotesque Alice-in-Wonderland world in which convicted criminals, often with long records of deception, swear solemn oaths on the Bible and give testimony which sends decent men to prison. It is a world in which lies are ratified by the court and where honest service to other people is penalised with prison sentences of up to 15 years. It is a world where political correctness and the compensation culture have triumphed over justice. </p> <p>Why, if evidence suggests that individual allegations are fabricated, do juries use them as a basis for convicting? The answer is simple. </p> <p>In cases where allegations are trawled, juries are not able to assess individual complaints on their own merits. The whole purpose of trawling is to try to prove that abuse has taken place not by finding supporting evidence but by multiplying the number of complaints against a particular suspect. </p> <p>In fact, the sheer quantity of allegations does not prove anything. But this method continues to be used because it works; it usually results in convictions. By launching trawling operations, and piling up huge numbers of allegations against individual care workers, police forces have found a way of destroying the presumption of innocence and obscuring the weakness of individual complaints. Whenever this happens, justice itself will almost inevitably fail. </p> <p>Without any doubt these operations are dangerous. But what is truly terrifying is the speed with which they have spread from police force to police force until, at a cost of hundreds of millions of pounds, practically the whole country has been covered by a trawling net. </p> <p>It should be emphasised once again that some trawled allegations will lead to the conviction of people who are guilty. But it is precisely the fact that it has a core of reasonableness that renders this particular witch-hunt so dangerous, and makes it more likely that innocent men like David Jones will be stretched on the rack which has been devised for the guilty. </p> <p>The other group who are already beginning to suffer are those who were abused while in care. For, by producing large numbers of false allegations, trawling operations have debased the entire currency of complaints. Tragically, real victims may now find that their truthful testimony is disbelieved. </p> <p>'If the public knew what was going on they would be appalled,' said Merseyside solicitor Chris Saltrese at the beginning of last week. He is right. Except that he was speaking before the collapse of the Jones trial on Tuesday. By Wednesday morning the public did know what was going on. Or at least they were a lot better informed. </p> <p>This is crucial. One reason why the current witch-hunt has spread so rapidly and so silently is that all democracies depend ultimately on journalists to safeguard their essential liberties. Yet in this case journalists bear the main responsibility for creating a moral panic around care homes and, until very recently, for keeping both politicians and the public in the dark about what has really been happening. </p> <p>Now that the media spotlight on David Jones has at last illuminated this darkness, it is time for the Government to act. Until now Home Office Ministers have responded to complaints about trawling by saying that operational matters are for chief constables to decide. But the Government did not say that in the Stephen Lawrence case, and it should not say it now. When the Government does intervene, as it surely must, it should not fall into the trap of blaming the police. Its task should be not to chastise the police but to rescue them from the folly we have forced them into. </p> <p>For the police did not create a moral panic about sexual abuse in care homes. We did. By doing so and by placing intolerable pressure on police forces to investigate non-existent paedophile rings, we have created a machine for bringing about injustice. This machine is now out of control and has already led to the greatest series of miscarriages of justice in British legal history. </p> <p>The collapse of the David Jones trial on Tuesday gives us an opportunity to bring this machine to a halt. It is an opportunity which should not be missed. </p> <p> Richard Webster is the author of The Great Children's Home Panic .</p>",

It followed 28 separate complaints by Lindo about police harassment of him and his family.

His wife, a Haringey Council housing officer, has been forced to take leave from work as a result of stress, and has herself been the alleged victim of a police assault.</p> <p>Deputy metropolitan commissioner Ian Blair told The Observer yesterday that the inquiry was an attempt by senior officers to break the cycle of arrests and complaints that has dogged the Lindo case. Scotland Yard hopes its swift conclusion will reassure the black community that the force is ridding itself of institutional racism in the aftermath of the Macpherson inquiry into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.</p> <p>'We are conscious of being a post-Stephen Lawrence organisation,' said Blair. 'We are trying to learn and admit our mistakes. But we also have to be fair to officers who work in a very challenging environment.'</p> <p>He said it would be impossible to discipline any of those involved because none had been given the opportunity to respond to Lindo's claims. 'This is not the vehicle for the discipline of any individual. We now need mature reflection on a complex issue.' He had no immediate plans for a further investigation.</p> <p>The inquiry team studied 93 individual intelligence reports on the Lindos, involving a total of 49 officers. A number of the incidents reported involved racially derogatory comments about the family.</p> <p>Gaffur said an unusually high level of correspondence between Lindo and the Police Complaints Authority had yielded no tangible result.</p> <p>Delroy and Sonia Lindo want a full public inquiry, and have indicated that an apology from the police will not be enough.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.bright@observer.co.uk\">martin.bright@observer.co.uk</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><br><a href=\"http://www.cre.gov.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">Commission for Racial Equality</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">Metropolitan Police</a></p>",

After pressure from Lee Jasper, race adviser to London Mayor Ken Livingstone, the police agreed to the inquiry. Lindo says his life has been made impossible since the harassment began. His wife, a Haringey Council housing officer, has been forced to take leave from work as a result of stress, and has herself been the alleged victim of a police assault. Deputy metropolitan commissioner Ian Blair told The Observer yesterday that the inquiry was an attempt by senior officers to break the cycle of arrests and complaints that has dogged the Lindo case. Scotland Yard hopes its swift conclusion will reassure the black community that the force is ridding itself of institutional racism in the aftermath of the Macpherson inquiry into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence. 'We are conscious of being a post-Stephen Lawrence organisation,' said Blair. 'We are trying to learn and admit our mistakes. But we also have to be fair to officers who work in a very challenging environment.' He said it would be impossible to discipline any of those involved because none had been given the opportunity to respond to Lindo's claims. 'This is not the vehicle for the discipline of any individual. We now need mature reflection on a complex issue.' He had no immediate plans for a further investigation. The inquiry team studied 93 individual intelligence reports on the Lindos, involving a total of 49 officers. A number of the incidents reported involved racially derogatory comments about the family. Gaffur said an unusually high level of correspondence between Lindo and the Police Complaints Authority had yielded no tangible result. Delroy and Sonia Lindo want a full public inquiry, and have indicated that an apology from the police will not be enough. martin.bright@observer.co.uk Useful links Commission for Racial Equality Metropolitan Police",

      "body": "<p>Our story begins in the Shah's Iran: a 17-year-old militant, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, sets up a guerilla movement, arms himself with a knife and stabs a policeman as he tries to steal his gun. His plan was to rob a bank for revolutionary funds. But the policeman shoots him in the stomach and the teenager is jailed for seven years.</p> <p>Freed after the 1979 revolution, our former revolutionary is made head of the Propaganda Bureau of Islamic Arts and Thought. He writes radio plays and books and makes short documentaries. He then moves on to feature films and soon wins international recognition with movies such as 1989's Dasstforoosh (The Peddler). By this time he has made 15 features and written 28 books. All this from a man who left school at 11 to help support his family and didn't see his first film until after the revolution.</p> <p>Mohsen Makhmalbaf is now a superstar in Iran and a legend in world cinema. He was awarded the medal of L'Officier de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government last year, yet little is known of him in Britain. This is about to change, with the opening in the UK on 29 December of his daughter Samira's movie, Blackboards, which won the Jury prize at this year's Cannes festival. Still only 18, Samira was a judge at the Venice Film Festival last summer and earlier this year received the Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut Award and the Unesco Federico Fellini medal. </p> <p>It is just four years since Samira, who appeared in her father's film The Cyclist when she was eight, decided to leave school before her diploma year to study cinema. But where? There were no film schools in Iran. Her father drafted a proposal to the Ministry of Culture asking for funds and permission to set up the country's first film school with places for 100 students. But Makhmalbaf was already a thorn in the side of the Ministry. They told him 'that one dangerous filmmaker like me was enough for one country and that 100 others like me were not needed'. </p> <p>So he set up The Makhmalbaf Film School at home. His first students were his children, his wife Marzieh Meshkini and four friends. The youngest was Hana, then eight, whose short video The Day the Aunt was Ill was screened just a year later at the 1997 Locarno Film Festival. The oldest was Ebrahim Ghafori, in his twenties, who went on to photograph Samira's first film, The Apple, and Blackboards.</p> <p>Makhmalbaf remortgaged his home to finance the school and the making of his 1996 film, A Moment of Innocence, in which he appears with the policeman he stabbed in his youth, who turned up one day asking to be in one of his films. Banned by the Ministry of Culture because Makhmalbaf refused to make the cuts they demanded, it remains his favourite film.</p> <p>Because he was not allowed to distribute A Moment of Innocence Makhmalbaf lost the family home. Nonetheless, he dedicated himself to teaching for the next four years. Two years after the school was set up, Samira, the catalyst, made her first feature, The Apple, in which she re-enacts the lives of two young girls whose father kept them locked up for 11 years with their blind mother. </p> <p>Inevitably, since her father wrote, produced and edited the film, some suggested that it was more her father's film than hers. But it was clear to those who knew Samira that, young as she was, she was too strong-minded to play second fiddle. She said at Cannes that she expected people to suggest that her father was the real auteur of The Apple, and that made her happy 'because that meant it was a good film'. But the suggestions became tiresome. 'Of course there is his presence,' she snapped one day at a press conference. He was editor, screenwriter and father. That's quite an influence.'</p> <p>Her new film Blackboards, set in Iranian Kurdistan, is also edited by Makhmalbaf but this time she co-wrote with him and any lingering doubts about the extent of her father's involvement are firmly banished on viewing her brother Maysam's documentary, How Samira Made Blackboards, which was shown at Venice this year. </p> <p>Shot with a handheld camera and a few professional actors among local amateurs, Blackboards centres on two itinerant teachers carrying blackboards in the mountains near the Iraq border seeking pupils. One meets a group of boys who smuggle contraband (much of it almost too heavy for them to carry), the other a group of Iraqi refugees trying to cross the border, most of them before they die of old age, all constantly in danger of air and ground attack from border guards. Samira lived with the Kurds while location-seeking and evolving her screenplay and filmed for three months ('without even calling home') in the hostile natural terrain which also hides postwar land mines. One scene of Maysam's documentary shows her unsuccessful attempts to persuade a professional actor to tone down his performance. In response to his comment that she should 'never tell an actor what to do', she replaces him with a non-professional. Her hard physical training at her father's film school also came to the fore when she plunged into an icy river in order to persuade her actors to do likewise. </p> <p>For Samira, cinema 'borders between dream and reality'. She describes her film as appearing 'realistic because of the extreme simplicity of the dialogue which resembles real-life words that the characters would speak'. </p> <p>Marzieh Meshkini is Samira's aunt - and her stepmother. Marzieh's sister, who died tragically young in an accident, was Makhmalbaf's first wife. A 30-year-old geology and biology graduate, Marzieh was an assistant director on Makhmalbaf's The Silence, and on Samira's The Apple and Blackboards. The Day I Became a Woman, her own first film, screened this year in Venice and winner of the Jury Prize in Thessaloniki, is as remarkable and fascinating as either of her step-daughter's. Due to open in the UK next year, it comprises three stories about women at the beginning, middle and the end of their lives.</p> <p>The extraordinary Makhmalbaf Film House is now a formidable force in Iran - and not only in film. Samira, while largely conforming to dress codes, wears a black scarf wound around her head and tucked subversively behind her ears in place of a hijab. She accepted the Cannes award 'on behalf of the new, young generation who struggle for democracy and a better life in Iran' and donated her $5,000 Truffaut award to the building of a school for 40 pupils in the village of Dehbar in Kurdestan.</p> <p>The family production house has clearly established its space and influence in Iranian and international cinema with films that are personal, highly original and uniquely Iranian. 'Hollywood has occupied cinemas all over the world. Because we're not occupied we can develop our own cinema,' says Meshkini. </p> <p>Mohsen Makhmalbaf, whose ironically surrealist short film The Test of Democracy made its debut at Venice 2000, is shooting in remote Iranian Baluchestan Sun behind the Moon, which deals with Afghan refugees in Iran. Samira and Meshkini are deciding what to do next and we have yet to discover what the future holds for Maysam and Hana. </p> <p>Blackboards opens in the UK on 29 December.

They are the Daily and Sunday Express, in a real sense. They will take their talents else where, to eager competitors. It is, thus far, a dismal, disorderly performance. </p> <p>And yet, remember, there was something worth bidding for, something apparently worth \u00a3125 million, before this frenzy began. The Daily Mail (like the Telegraph) was in the ring, offering professional purpose. That may not have appealed to Lord Hollick, over and out of the door carrying his cash, but it's a suitable place to start any calmer consideration of what the Express could still rescue from the debris strewn across Blackfriars bridge. Why was the young Lord Rothermere so interested? </p> <p>Forget the tales of ancestral hubris: Harmsworth and Aitken, Montagu and Capulet. They're fun, but they butter no share prices. If Associated was interested in buying its ancient rival, there was method, and potential profitability, in their madness. Savings? Of course, through management synergies: but savings without recovering sales don't offer hope. The Mail had a plan. </p> <p>Part of that plan, to be sure, was defensive. Why let a fresh foe operate on your middle-market patch when you can achieve an effective monopoly for a few million more? Not enough. Buying the Express titles to keep them on a life support system isn't the Mail way. Look, rather, at the growth of their Metro morning freesheets in many of Britain's biggest cities. </p> <p>There are two driving ideas behind these Metros, both of them, as it happens, borrowed and developed from the Swedes who invented the concept. One is that free papers fed to a captive commuter audience can generate rich advertising revenues (especially if a core product can be rolled out to attract national display advertisers). The other is that a spartan diet of simple, politically neutral news, to be sampled on the Tube, can persuade young travellers who wouldn't otherwise get the reading habit to start picking up a newspaper for the first time. </p> <p>The thesis, in sum, is that the Metros don't drain away sales from the paid-for titles (especially the Evening Standard); rather they fill a gap in the market. Perhaps, on the figures, that isn't quite true. There is some seepage on many titles. Yet, still, it remains broadly right and broadly illustrated by Metro's distribution (not circulation) figures - now nearing 800,000 every morning. </p> <p>Question: if the notion of simplicity and neutrality works for these frees, would it also work for a drastically changed Express which had the same editorial approach and filled in the holes between the Tube stations - an Express which was, in effect, the core of this core product? Pull that trick and you have a different kind of mid-market tabloid reaching almost 2 million readers every morning. </p> <p>We'll probably never know. The Expresses and the Star have a distinct and equally uncertain future in liaison with OK!, Big Ones and Asian Babes. Celebrities and nipples have their \u00a3125m time of national trial. What's interesting, however, is the creativity Associated brought to the table: the emphasis on new papers, and new approaches to getting them into readers' hands. </p> <p>That is true strategy. In the newsprint world around us, the world where facts ordain necessary decisions, you can feel the next 'reality' taking shape. Newsprint itself won't be so so cheap: watch for 15 per cent price rises next year. This will be a particular pain for 'free' sheets, which rely on advertising to provide profit on the bottom line. </p> <p>Against that (and against the march of e-commerce) there's a natural premium on original thinking, on innovation that fits changed circumstances. Maybe the Mail senses that every formula has its sell-by date; maybe it can feel the joints stiffening, the older columnists slowing up, the memory of the perfect family in the perfect (Fifties) Britain fading. In which case, it will need to move on as well. </p> <p>But the Express, losing readers and staff, gaining only turmoil for the moment? That looks like the Mail 's Plan B. If you can't buy it, let it be sold to somebody who doesn't love and understand, a proprietor without the gift of calm.</p>",

If Associated was interested in buying its ancient rival, there was method, and potential profitability, in their madness. Savings? Of course, through management synergies: but savings without recovering sales don't offer hope. The Mail had a plan. Part of that plan, to be sure, was defensive. Why let a fresh foe operate on your middle-market patch when you can achieve an effective monopoly for a few million more? Not enough. Buying the Express titles to keep them on a life support system isn't the Mail way. Look, rather, at the growth of their Metro morning freesheets in many of Britain's biggest cities. There are two driving ideas behind these Metros, both of them, as it happens, borrowed and developed from the Swedes who invented the concept. One is that free papers fed to a captive commuter audience can generate rich advertising revenues (especially if a core product can be rolled out to attract national display advertisers). The other is that a spartan diet of simple, politically neutral news, to be sampled on the Tube, can persuade young travellers who wouldn't otherwise get the reading habit to start picking up a newspaper for the first time. The thesis, in sum, is that the Metros don't drain away sales from the paid-for titles (especially the Evening Standard); rather they fill a gap in the market. Perhaps, on the figures, that isn't quite true. There is some seepage on many titles. Yet, still, it remains broadly right and broadly illustrated by Metro's distribution (not circulation) figures - now nearing 800,000 every morning. Question: if the notion of simplicity and neutrality works for these frees, would it also work for a drastically changed Express which had the same editorial approach and filled in the holes between the Tube stations - an Express which was, in effect, the core of this core product? Pull that trick and you have a different kind of mid-market tabloid reaching almost 2 million readers every morning. We'll probably never know. The Expresses and the Star have a distinct and equally uncertain future in liaison with OK!, Big Ones and Asian Babes. Celebrities and nipples have their \u00a3125m time of national trial. What's interesting, however, is the creativity Associated brought to the table: the emphasis on new papers, and new approaches to getting them into readers' hands. That is true strategy. In the newsprint world around us, the world where facts ordain necessary decisions, you can feel the next 'reality' taking shape. Newsprint itself won't be so so cheap: watch for 15 per cent price rises next year. This will be a particular pain for 'free' sheets, which rely on advertising to provide profit on the bottom line. Against that (and against the march of e-commerce) there's a natural premium on original thinking, on innovation that fits changed circumstances. Maybe the Mail senses that every formula has its sell-by date; maybe it can feel the joints stiffening, the older columnists slowing up, the memory of the perfect family in the perfect (Fifties) Britain fading. In which case, it will need to move on as well. But the Express, losing readers and staff, gaining only turmoil for the moment? That looks like the Mail 's Plan B. If you can't buy it, let it be sold to somebody who doesn't love and understand, a proprietor without the gift of calm.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Kyle MacLachlan leans closely into my tape recorder. We are in a London restaurant, the first course has just arrived, and clearly he feels the occasion should be meticulously documented. 'For the record,' he tells the tape, 'this looks fantastic. Lentil soup with a little bit of basil sprinkled on top - no, arugula. I think it's arugula.' </p> <p>Fans of David Lynch's cult television series Twin Peaks will recognise the gesture. As FBI agent Dale Cooper, MacLachlan developed a signature line in Dictaphone recordings. 'Diane,' he would always begin, addressing his unseen secretary, 'I must remember to find out what kind of trees these are', or 'I had a damn fine slice of cherry pie this afternoon'. In these messages, which ranged from the nerdily mundane to the pricelessly important, MacLachlan's whole style was to be found - he played the controlled, sharp-eyed cop, with a feeling for the darkness beyond and a compulsion to set down every detail, for the record.</p> <p>MacLachlan knows it's his most famous role, and he likes to play with it. He will tell you, for instance, that he really isn't crazy about cherry pie, but then he will keep breaking off sentences to make sure the Dictaphone has registered his running commentary of peripheral information. He both is and is not his screen persona. And perhaps, for many, that persona is no longer the most familiar thing about him.</p> <p>MacLachlan hasn't worked with David Lynch for nearly a decade, and he hasn't really inhabited a role in the same way since. The media gaze has shifted, instead, to his glamorous love life. He has had long-term relationships with two of his leading ladies, Laura Dern and Lara Flynn Boyle, but it wasn't until 1992, when he started dating the supermodel Linda Evangelista, that his private life became quite so public.</p> <p>In the six years the couple were together, they adorned the pages of a thousand magazines. 'It was wonderful,' he says now, 'she'd be working in Cairo, and I'd go with her, and I'd work on scripts or I'd read...' He smiles. 'Neglecting the career, you know.' That, to some extent, was a choice. 'I liked who I was, in a way. It was a great excuse not to have to deal with struggles in Los Angeles, and the process of trying to get through that door.'</p> <p>Now, though, his career has reached a turning point. No longer 'chasing the cash cow', as he puts it, or being shoehorned into a standard Hollywood career, he plays an intriguing Claudius in a new screen version of Hamlet, his favourite play ('That one and Othello. And Lear. And Macbeth. OK, I like a lot of Shakespeare'). The film's director, Michael Almereyda, says MacLachlan was concerned he might be 'too young and, perhaps, too benign to play the poisonous king'. But he cast him, Almereyda says, because of the double edge that had come across so well in his movies with Lynch, that 'something clouded and equivocal in his eyes'.</p> <p>Maclachlan has longer hair now than his uniform slicked crop, and, at 41, a slightly more rugged, more bronzed face. He's confident, jokey, at ease with himself. But he does still have that all-American voice, and the charm of a boyish, accidental gentleman. Over the course of a long conversation, he becomes very open, softly self-searching, willing to peel back a few layers of his life to show you how very Lynch-like he is, after all.</p> <p>Kyle MacLachlan grew up in a small town called Yakima, in Washington State, a place similar to Twin Peaks, or Lumberton, the setting for his best Lynch movie, Blue Velvet. </p> <p>He describes it as 'a fruit producing and farming kind of place', and goes on: 'our house had been built on an old apple orchard. As kids we would pick the apples and try and sell them to the neighbours. I remember going down to the cannery with my Mom and canning fruit for the season. It was really, you know, one of those places where you don't have to lock your doors.' His father was an attorney, then a stockbroker, and an excellent pianist. His mother was active in the community. Kyle was the eldest of three brothers, and felt that he had to be 'not only responsible, but really good, really well-behaved. I didn't want to cause my parents any kind of worry'. He felt particular pressure from his mother. 'I wanted to make her proud of me, more than anything else.' </p> <p>When he went to college, in Seattle, he felt out of place, young for his age, and frightened. His parents had recently got divorced, and although to some extent he experienced this as a liberation from the pressure to be good - 'I smoked pot for the first time, started staying out late for the first time, doing the kind of things that I would never have gotten away with before' - he only spent a couple of terms at drama school and went home again. </p> <p>Back in Yakima, he worked in a lumber factory making doors, but the theatre bug hadn't quite left him. 'It was an odd mix - I was infected by it, but I was also very resistant to it. I felt I shouldn't be liking it. Should is a very big word in my life.'</p> <p>After an inspiring stint in summer stock theatre, he went back to school, and this time, when he had to do an emotional scene, instead of joking around, 'I just lost my shit'. A short monologue he had written about his father precipitated an outpouring: 'It was one of the best things I could have done, for my psyche as well as for the building of my career... That says a bit about that emotional distancing that was really important to me, growing up - to stay together, to stay on top of it, to be always in control.'</p> <p>It says something about his own character, but also about those he came to play on screen. In his Lynch roles, and especially in Blue Velvet, he plays a naif with a blank, fresh face - a cipher that has some curiosity behind it. In Twin Peaks he is the calm man in control of any situation, who has a hidden secret in his past. MacLachlan's screen presence is founded on precisely the kind of two-way tension he describes in relation to his life. Blue Velvet 's Jeffrey Beaumont is a boy who is, as MacLachlan puts it, 'frightened by his fascinations'. He is drawn to the world of violent adult sex, the land of 'bad things', but he is also of a piece with the red roses and the picket fence.</p> <p>When David Lynch cast him in Dune, MacLachlan's first film, as a good son leading his people into intergalactic battle, he said he saw in him a 'genuine spiritual quality, a sort of innocence'. Two years later, he saw Blue Velvet 's Jeffrey in Kyle: 'He can play naive and innocent and obsessive,' Lynch said. 'With some actors, when you look in their eyes, you just don't see them thinking. Kyle can think on-screen.' MacLachlan, it seems, thought that way off-screen, too. 'I read the script,' he tells me, 'and I said, I understand everything that goes on, I understand how you could be drawn into a woman like this.'</p> <p>The woman in question, a heavy-lidded nightclub singer played by Isabella Rossellini, became the source of another, rather interesting double bind in MacLachlan's life. In the film, Rossellini's character Dorothy Vallens has a sado-masochistic affair with a violent man played by Dennis Hopper. In a difficult scene, Jeffrey watches them through the slatted doors of a wardrobe. He gets drawn, not unwillingly, into a love triangle, and into their murderous world. Before he agreed to do the movie, MacLachlan asked his parents to read the script.</p> <p>'My Dad was fine with it, but I gave it to my Mom to read, and she couldn't say anything. I asked her point-blank, are you all right with this, and she said, well, no. And I said, then I won't do it.' What his mother objected to was the way in which Rossellini, the sex object and mother-figure, was treated in the film. 'That whole thing was very shocking to her,' MacLachlan explains. 'I'm not saying she should have been more worldly. I'm saying she had exactly the right reaction. The reaction that was wrong was mine. Well, not wrong, it was understandable, but not honest.'</p> <p>Why was it not honest? I ask. 'Well, because months went by, and I couldn't get a job. And David called again, and partly because I needed to work and partly because the script had never left my head, I said yes. And David said, \"I knew you'd come back.\"'</p> <p>Lynch and MacLachlan had, in those early days, a relationship so finely tuned it was almost telepathic. Lynch likened himself to Jeffrey, his fictional creation, and MacLachlan was sometimes seen as Lynch's alter-ego. When he played the character, he borrowed some of Lynch's personal traits. The buttoned-up shirt, for example, is trademark Lynch. Once, when asked why he wore his shirts like that, Lynch replied, with a worried logic that could just as well have come from Kyle, that he felt 'too vulnerable with the top button opened'.</p> <p>Famously, Lynch directs by instinct, and somehow, MacLachlan understood what he wanted. 'He'd say, \"A little more like Elvis\". I was kind of going, OK... is it the hair? Is it the voice? The sneer? But it wasn't about Elvis at all. It was about the essence of Elvis. Or sometimes we'd do a take and we would huddle together, and just nod - not speaking, and I would go do the scene again and that would be it. It was very strange. It was really strange.'</p> <p>Blue Velvet is now regarded as a classic, but MacLachlan's mother, whom he had been so eager to please, even as he was drawn, in fiction, to another older woman, died before the film was released. 'My Mom had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer when I was filming Dune ,' MacLachlan says, 'so that would have been '83. And she didn't want to tell me, didn't want to tell me, didn't want to tell me, and finally told me - she didn't want me to worry. That's the kind of woman she was. She didn't want to bother me, because I was working on my first film and all that. But she fought it for five years.'</p> <p>I ask him how he took her death. 'Ummm...,' he reflects, 'I have guilt about it now, because I felt like I should have been there more for her during the time she was suffering - I think I was very selfish. I was 23, through like 28, and I was in the middle of my career, and in LA, and I would talk to her, and she was always very positive. Her husband would say that it was late at night when he was holding her...'</p> <p>At this point, MacLachlan covers his face, and muffles a brief, unexpected sob. There is a pause, and when he takes his hands away his eyes are welled up with tears. 'At night was when the fear would overtake her. But she never let it out for kids. She was... quite remarkable. Anyway,' he goes on, fully composed now, 'she fought it, and she died on 11 January. That was '86, coming up on 15 years ago. I have so many questions for her now... I'm much more ready to talk about feelings. I wasn't then.'</p> <p>MacLachlan and Lynch parted ways after Twin Peaks, and, ever self-critical, he insists that this is his own fault. 'I really abused the relationship,' he says. 'I don't know how David feels about me talking about this,' MacLachlan pauses, 'but... what the fuck, you know... Without getting too specific about it... David and Mark [Frost - the executive producers of Twin Peaks] were only around for the first series, and I fought and fought to try and get them back - but... I think we all felt a little abandoned. So I was fairly resentful when the film, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, came round. I wanted to have a meaningful discussion about some of those scenes, and David was unwilling to do that, so I was not in those scenes - Chris Isaac was in them, instead of me. And looking back, I blame myself for the process... you learn a lesson. And that sort of was... the crack. I don't know if David and I will work together again. I hope so.'</p> <p>Initially, those who represented Maclach- lan in LA worried that the Lynch imprint might be too strong, and that his quirky roles would hinder him on the traditional Hollywood ladder. They vied for romantic leads on his behalf. 'I remember Sex, Lies, and Videotape came,' he says, 'and I turned it down, because I thought it was too much of the same thing. And Jimmy Spader did it. I was trying to move away from those kind of roles.' The unfortunate consequence of this plan was that he missed out on the work he would have been best at.</p> <p>He has, however, worked regularly: with Oliver Stone on The Doors, in which he played a stiff Ray Manzarek, the keyboard player. He was Joseph K in a version of The Trial, a Pinter adaptation of Kafka filmed in Prague. For fun, he took a part in the movie of The Flintstones, and a year later, in 1995, he appeared in a famous chauvinistic flop, Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls. 'No, no,' he insists, laughing, 'I want you to bring up Showgirls. You can't run from your past!' He had thought, he explains, that the film would turn out to be much darker, harder.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the video rests in peace as soft porn, mostly thanks to two of his own 'great love scenes', as he sarcastically puts it. 'The pool sequence,' he sighs, 'was terrifying. Because I had to be completely starkers walking into the pool... I remember reading an article about Oliver Reed, before they shot that naked wrestling scene in Women in Love, about him stroking himself off-camera, and trying to bring some life into his manhood - not to get a full on, you know, but just to sort of give it girth and... potential. And ah... when I did that scene I was completely with Oliver on that one.'</p> <p>In 1997 he made a film with Mike Figgis, One Night Stand, in which he plays a prim cuckold, and he has since worked with Figgis again, on the recent movie Time Code. He did some TV, and commercials (you may even remember him in a British Vodaphone ad). But for most of the 90s, he was famous for being, as the tabloids would have it, Linda's live-in lover.</p> <p>The couple met in 1992, when Evangelista was married to Gerald Marie, the head of Elite modelling agency, who recently resigned after allegations that he had seduced underage girls. MacLachlan was asked to do a photo shoot, an ad for Barney's department store in New York, with Linda Evangelista.</p> <p>'I didn't know who Linda Evangelista was,' he says. 'I mean, I knew she was a model, and I fantasised that maybe she looked like Helena Christiansen or something like that... So I met her there, and I was just, quite taken, you know - and I think it was true of her, too.' A rumour soon spread that they had got together that first night, since MacLachlan turned up for work the next day wearing the same T-shirt. 'I didn't come to work in the same T-shirt,' he says, justifying himself, 'but it was a similar T-shirt. It was a motorcycle T-shirt.' He pauses, thinking whether to go on. 'We didn't get together the first night. We actually got together the second night. If truth be told.'</p> <p>Evangelista left her husband, and they stayed together for six years. 'The glamorous part of it,' he remembers, 'I knew I was a visitor, somehow. The travelling, and restaurants - there was certainly a lot of that, but there was also a lot of really great family hangin' out fun. That was one of the great things about Linda, she loved to have a good time with friends, and entertaining. That's where she's at her best - she loves having people around and a bunch of noise, and we shared that.'</p> <p>They broke up over the issue of marriage. They had been engaged so long, MacLachlan says, it was getting to be ridiculous. 'It was just... sealing the deal, with the marriage. I was quite happy just being with her. I wasn't necessarily resistant to marriage but it seemed like I was, and maybe I was, but I just liked things the way we were. Obviously she wanted more. So. She called it a day.' I ask if he was still in love with her for a long time. 'Yeah. Yeah, I was. Obviously the feelings that I was going through were more complex than that, but, yeah. And once I'd gotten through that I met Desir\u00e9e.'</p> <p>He met his current girlfriend, a publicist named Desir\u00e9e Gruber, at his chiropractor's office. He describes a scene that could have been scripted by Woody Allen. 'I was in traction, because I'd ruptured a disk. I'd been there so long I knew how to take myself out of traction. So I got out of my traction chair, and hobbled up to the front desk and said hello. And quite by chance, I went to this party, and she was there. We ended up just talking and having a great night. Then I found out she lived in New York! That was about a year and a half ago. So we've been commuting, and I've been spending more time in New York - working on Sex and the City, and seeing theatre... I just started to thaw a little bit.'</p> <p>MacLachlan seems contented, ready to 'talk about feelings', as he says, and happier about his career. 'I feel a bit of a turn now,' he says, 'back towards something that I really want to do. And it feels good, it feels like I'm staking out a new road, in a way.' He stars in a new series of Sex and the City, he's just shot a British film, Me Without You, on the Isle of Man, and seems proud of his part in Hamlet . He is very articulate about how Hamlet's stepfather should appear, and why his charming portrayal is so appropriate.</p> <p>'He shouldn't look like a bad guy,' MacLachlan argues. 'He shouldn't be a villain. You want to discover that, as the audience, you want to see that emerge. Because it's like the shell that's holding Claudius together slowly starts to split, and all this stuff starts seeping out'. After our meal, MacLachlan tells me that certain things had become clearer to him as we spoke. What exactly, I ask. 'Oh,' he says, 'just some things about my childhood, and the power of the expectation that was on me.' He knew about it, he thinks, but had not put it together in that way before. As he considers what was under the surface, he makes a gesture with his hand, as if trying to force a ball into water. It's a perfect image of suppression - wanting to sink something that floats - and yet in that very fine line of tension, he has built his entire acting life.</p> <p>\u2022 Hamlet opens on Friday. The new series of Sex and the City starts on 10 January on Channel 4 at 10pm.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Kyle MacLachlan leans closely into my tape recorder. We are in a London restaurant, the first course has just arrived, and clearly he feels the occasion should be meticulously documented. 'For the record,' he tells the tape, 'this looks fantastic. Lentil soup with a little bit of basil sprinkled on top - no, arugula. I think it's arugula.' Fans of David Lynch's cult television series Twin Peaks will recognise the gesture. As FBI agent Dale Cooper, MacLachlan developed a signature line in Dictaphone recordings. 'Diane,' he would always begin, addressing his unseen secretary, 'I must remember to find out what kind of trees these are', or 'I had a damn fine slice of cherry pie this afternoon'. In these messages, which ranged from the nerdily mundane to the pricelessly important, MacLachlan's whole style was to be found - he played the controlled, sharp-eyed cop, with a feeling for the darkness beyond and a compulsion to set down every detail, for the record. MacLachlan knows it's his most famous role, and he likes to play with it. He will tell you, for instance, that he really isn't crazy about cherry pie, but then he will keep breaking off sentences to make sure the Dictaphone has registered his running commentary of peripheral information. He both is and is not his screen persona. And perhaps, for many, that persona is no longer the most familiar thing about him. MacLachlan hasn't worked with David Lynch for nearly a decade, and he hasn't really inhabited a role in the same way since. The media gaze has shifted, instead, to his glamorous love life. He has had long-term relationships with two of his leading ladies, Laura Dern and Lara Flynn Boyle, but it wasn't until 1992, when he started dating the supermodel Linda Evangelista, that his private life became quite so public. In the six years the couple were together, they adorned the pages of a thousand magazines. 'It was wonderful,' he says now, 'she'd be working in Cairo, and I'd go with her, and I'd work on scripts or I'd read...' He smiles. 'Neglecting the career, you know.' That, to some extent, was a choice. 'I liked who I was, in a way. It was a great excuse not to have to deal with struggles in Los Angeles, and the process of trying to get through that door.' Now, though, his career has reached a turning point. No longer 'chasing the cash cow', as he puts it, or being shoehorned into a standard Hollywood career, he plays an intriguing Claudius in a new screen version of Hamlet, his favourite play ('That one and Othello. And Lear. And Macbeth. OK, I like a lot of Shakespeare'). The film's director, Michael Almereyda, says MacLachlan was concerned he might be 'too young and, perhaps, too benign to play the poisonous king'. But he cast him, Almereyda says, because of the double edge that had come across so well in his movies with Lynch, that 'something clouded and equivocal in his eyes'. Maclachlan has longer hair now than his uniform slicked crop, and, at 41, a slightly more rugged, more bronzed face. He's confident, jokey, at ease with himself. But he does still have that all-American voice, and the charm of a boyish, accidental gentleman. Over the course of a long conversation, he becomes very open, softly self-searching, willing to peel back a few layers of his life to show you how very Lynch-like he is, after all. Kyle MacLachlan grew up in a small town called Yakima, in Washington State, a place similar to Twin Peaks, or Lumberton, the setting for his best Lynch movie, Blue Velvet. He describes it as 'a fruit producing and farming kind of place', and goes on: 'our house had been built on an old apple orchard. As kids we would pick the apples and try and sell them to the neighbours. I remember going down to the cannery with my Mom and canning fruit for the season. It was really, you know, one of those places where you don't have to lock your doors.' His father was an attorney, then a stockbroker, and an excellent pianist. His mother was active in the community. Kyle was the eldest of three brothers, and felt that he had to be 'not only responsible, but really good, really well-behaved. I didn't want to cause my parents any kind of worry'. He felt particular pressure from his mother. 'I wanted to make her proud of me, more than anything else.' When he went to college, in Seattle, he felt out of place, young for his age, and frightened. His parents had recently got divorced, and although to some extent he experienced this as a liberation from the pressure to be good - 'I smoked pot for the first time, started staying out late for the first time, doing the kind of things that I would never have gotten away with before' - he only spent a couple of terms at drama school and went home again. Back in Yakima, he worked in a lumber factory making doors, but the theatre bug hadn't quite left him. 'It was an odd mix - I was infected by it, but I was also very resistant to it. I felt I shouldn't be liking it. Should is a very big word in my life.' After an inspiring stint in summer stock theatre, he went back to school, and this time, when he had to do an emotional scene, instead of joking around, 'I just lost my shit'. A short monologue he had written about his father precipitated an outpouring: 'It was one of the best things I could have done, for my psyche as well as for the building of my career... That says a bit about that emotional distancing that was really important to me, growing up - to stay together, to stay on top of it, to be always in control.' It says something about his own character, but also about those he came to play on screen. In his Lynch roles, and especially in Blue Velvet, he plays a naif with a blank, fresh face - a cipher that has some curiosity behind it. In Twin Peaks he is the calm man in control of any situation, who has a hidden secret in his past. MacLachlan's screen presence is founded on precisely the kind of two-way tension he describes in relation to his life. Blue Velvet 's Jeffrey Beaumont is a boy who is, as MacLachlan puts it, 'frightened by his fascinations'. He is drawn to the world of violent adult sex, the land of 'bad things', but he is also of a piece with the red roses and the picket fence. When David Lynch cast him in Dune, MacLachlan's first film, as a good son leading his people into intergalactic battle, he said he saw in him a 'genuine spiritual quality, a sort of innocence'. Two years later, he saw Blue Velvet 's Jeffrey in Kyle: 'He can play naive and innocent and obsessive,' Lynch said. 'With some actors, when you look in their eyes, you just don't see them thinking. Kyle can think on-screen.' MacLachlan, it seems, thought that way off-screen, too. 'I read the script,' he tells me, 'and I said, I understand everything that goes on, I understand how you could be drawn into a woman like this.' The woman in question, a heavy-lidded nightclub singer played by Isabella Rossellini, became the source of another, rather interesting double bind in MacLachlan's life. In the film, Rossellini's character Dorothy Vallens has a sado-masochistic affair with a violent man played by Dennis Hopper. In a difficult scene, Jeffrey watches them through the slatted doors of a wardrobe. He gets drawn, not unwillingly, into a love triangle, and into their murderous world. Before he agreed to do the movie, MacLachlan asked his parents to read the script. 'My Dad was fine with it, but I gave it to my Mom to read, and she couldn't say anything. I asked her point-blank, are you all right with this, and she said, well, no. And I said, then I won't do it.' What his mother objected to was the way in which Rossellini, the sex object and mother-figure, was treated in the film. 'That whole thing was very shocking to her,' MacLachlan explains. 'I'm not saying she should have been more worldly. I'm saying she had exactly the right reaction. The reaction that was wrong was mine. Well, not wrong, it was understandable, but not honest.' Why was it not honest? I ask. 'Well, because months went by, and I couldn't get a job. And David called again, and partly because I needed to work and partly because the script had never left my head, I said yes. And David said, \"I knew you'd come back.\"' Lynch and MacLachlan had, in those early days, a relationship so finely tuned it was almost telepathic. Lynch likened himself to Jeffrey, his fictional creation, and MacLachlan was sometimes seen as Lynch's alter-ego. When he played the character, he borrowed some of Lynch's personal traits. The buttoned-up shirt, for example, is trademark Lynch. Once, when asked why he wore his shirts like that, Lynch replied, with a worried logic that could just as well have come from Kyle, that he felt 'too vulnerable with the top button opened'. Famously, Lynch directs by instinct, and somehow, MacLachlan understood what he wanted. 'He'd say, \"A little more like Elvis\". I was kind of going, OK... is it the hair? Is it the voice? The sneer? But it wasn't about Elvis at all. It was about the essence of Elvis. Or sometimes we'd do a take and we would huddle together, and just nod - not speaking, and I would go do the scene again and that would be it. It was very strange. It was really strange.' Blue Velvet is now regarded as a classic, but MacLachlan's mother, whom he had been so eager to please, even as he was drawn, in fiction, to another older woman, died before the film was released. 'My Mom had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer when I was filming Dune ,' MacLachlan says, 'so that would have been '83. And she didn't want to tell me, didn't want to tell me, didn't want to tell me, and finally told me - she didn't want me to worry. That's the kind of woman she was. She didn't want to bother me, because I was working on my first film and all that. But she fought it for five years.' I ask him how he took her death. 'Ummm...,' he reflects, 'I have guilt about it now, because I felt like I should have been there more for her during the time she was suffering - I think I was very selfish. I was 23, through like 28, and I was in the middle of my career, and in LA, and I would talk to her, and she was always very positive. Her husband would say that it was late at night when he was holding her...' At this point, MacLachlan covers his face, and muffles a brief, unexpected sob. There is a pause, and when he takes his hands away his eyes are welled up with tears. 'At night was when the fear would overtake her. But she never let it out for kids. She was... quite remarkable. Anyway,' he goes on, fully composed now, 'she fought it, and she died on 11 January. That was '86, coming up on 15 years ago. I have so many questions for her now... I'm much more ready to talk about feelings. I wasn't then.' MacLachlan and Lynch parted ways after Twin Peaks, and, ever self-critical, he insists that this is his own fault. 'I really abused the relationship,' he says. 'I don't know how David feels about me talking about this,' MacLachlan pauses, 'but... what the fuck, you know... Without getting too specific about it... David and Mark [Frost - the executive producers of Twin Peaks] were only around for the first series, and I fought and fought to try and get them back - but... I think we all felt a little abandoned. So I was fairly resentful when the film, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, came round. I wanted to have a meaningful discussion about some of those scenes, and David was unwilling to do that, so I was not in those scenes - Chris Isaac was in them, instead of me. And looking back, I blame myself for the process... you learn a lesson. And that sort of was... the crack. I don't know if David and I will work together again. I hope so.' Initially, those who represented Maclach- lan in LA worried that the Lynch imprint might be too strong, and that his quirky roles would hinder him on the traditional Hollywood ladder. They vied for romantic leads on his behalf. 'I remember Sex, Lies, and Videotape came,' he says, 'and I turned it down, because I thought it was too much of the same thing. And Jimmy Spader did it. I was trying to move away from those kind of roles.' The unfortunate consequence of this plan was that he missed out on the work he would have been best at. He has, however, worked regularly: with Oliver Stone on The Doors, in which he played a stiff Ray Manzarek, the keyboard player. He was Joseph K in a version of The Trial, a Pinter adaptation of Kafka filmed in Prague. For fun, he took a part in the movie of The Flintstones, and a year later, in 1995, he appeared in a famous chauvinistic flop, Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls. 'No, no,' he insists, laughing, 'I want you to bring up Showgirls. You can't run from your past!' He had thought, he explains, that the film would turn out to be much darker, harder. Nevertheless, the video rests in peace as soft porn, mostly thanks to two of his own 'great love scenes', as he sarcastically puts it. 'The pool sequence,' he sighs, 'was terrifying. Because I had to be completely starkers walking into the pool... I remember reading an article about Oliver Reed, before they shot that naked wrestling scene in Women in Love, about him stroking himself off-camera, and trying to bring some life into his manhood - not to get a full on, you know, but just to sort of give it girth and... potential. And ah... when I did that scene I was completely with Oliver on that one.' In 1997 he made a film with Mike Figgis, One Night Stand, in which he plays a prim cuckold, and he has since worked with Figgis again, on the recent movie Time Code. He did some TV, and commercials (you may even remember him in a British Vodaphone ad). But for most of the 90s, he was famous for being, as the tabloids would have it, Linda's live-in lover. The couple met in 1992, when Evangelista was married to Gerald Marie, the head of Elite modelling agency, who recently resigned after allegations that he had seduced underage girls. MacLachlan was asked to do a photo shoot, an ad for Barney's department store in New York, with Linda Evangelista. 'I didn't know who Linda Evangelista was,' he says. 'I mean, I knew she was a model, and I fantasised that maybe she looked like Helena Christiansen or something like that... So I met her there, and I was just, quite taken, you know - and I think it was true of her, too.' A rumour soon spread that they had got together that first night, since MacLachlan turned up for work the next day wearing the same T-shirt. 'I didn't come to work in the same T-shirt,' he says, justifying himself, 'but it was a similar T-shirt. It was a motorcycle T-shirt.' He pauses, thinking whether to go on. 'We didn't get together the first night. We actually got together the second night. If truth be told.' Evangelista left her husband, and they stayed together for six years. 'The glamorous part of it,' he remembers, 'I knew I was a visitor, somehow. The travelling, and restaurants - there was certainly a lot of that, but there was also a lot of really great family hangin' out fun. That was one of the great things about Linda, she loved to have a good time with friends, and entertaining. That's where she's at her best - she loves having people around and a bunch of noise, and we shared that.' They broke up over the issue of marriage. They had been engaged so long, MacLachlan says, it was getting to be ridiculous. 'It was just... sealing the deal, with the marriage. I was quite happy just being with her. I wasn't necessarily resistant to marriage but it seemed like I was, and maybe I was, but I just liked things the way we were. Obviously she wanted more. So. She called it a day.' I ask if he was still in love with her for a long time. 'Yeah. Yeah, I was. Obviously the feelings that I was going through were more complex than that, but, yeah. And once I'd gotten through that I met Desir\u00e9e.' He met his current girlfriend, a publicist named Desir\u00e9e Gruber, at his chiropractor's office. He describes a scene that could have been scripted by Woody Allen. 'I was in traction, because I'd ruptured a disk. I'd been there so long I knew how to take myself out of traction. So I got out of my traction chair, and hobbled up to the front desk and said hello. And quite by chance, I went to this party, and she was there. We ended up just talking and having a great night. Then I found out she lived in New York! That was about a year and a half ago. So we've been commuting, and I've been spending more time in New York - working on Sex and the City, and seeing theatre... I just started to thaw a little bit.' MacLachlan seems contented, ready to 'talk about feelings', as he says, and happier about his career. 'I feel a bit of a turn now,' he says, 'back towards something that I really want to do. And it feels good, it feels like I'm staking out a new road, in a way.' He stars in a new series of Sex and the City, he's just shot a British film, Me Without You, on the Isle of Man, and seems proud of his part in Hamlet . He is very articulate about how Hamlet's stepfather should appear, and why his charming portrayal is so appropriate. 'He shouldn't look like a bad guy,' MacLachlan argues. 'He shouldn't be a villain. You want to discover that, as the audience, you want to see that emerge. Because it's like the shell that's holding Claudius together slowly starts to split, and all this stuff starts seeping out'. After our meal, MacLachlan tells me that certain things had become clearer to him as we spoke. What exactly, I ask. 'Oh,' he says, 'just some things about my childhood, and the power of the expectation that was on me.' He knew about it, he thinks, but had not put it together in that way before. As he considers what was under the surface, he makes a gesture with his hand, as if trying to force a ball into water. It's a perfect image of suppression - wanting to sink something that floats - and yet in that very fine line of tension, he has built his entire acting life. \u2022 Hamlet opens on Friday. The new series of Sex and the City starts on 10 January on Channel 4 at 10pm.",

      "body": "<p>Andreas Whittam Smith leapt into the limelight again the other day - the Bishop as Batman - by saying there should be sex shops in every town. His argument was perfectly logical. As president of the British Board of Film Classification, he oversees a species of video-rated 'Restricted 18' that can only be sold in licensed sex shops. But if there is no licensed shop in an area - and there are very few outside Soho - porn-seekers go to illegal traders who sell videos out of the backs of cars and mix paedophile and bestial material along with the normal hardcore. So Andreas believes local authorities should control and supervise the trade rather than ignore it, by encouraging the establishment of sex shops. </p> <p>Like so many of Andreas's arguments, this is on the one hand sensible and on the other hand slightly mad, or at any rate unrealistic. Naturally it sent the Daily Mail into a screaming frenzy. Stephen Glover, his old adversary from The Independent, accused him of wanting to sweep a tide of filth through every high street, so that you couldn't pop out for a loaf of bread without confronting 'window displays of mind-boggling sexual contraptions'. Other papers took up the hue and cry but Andreas, far from being alarmed by the clamour, was delighted. 'There was even a cartoon in The Sun !' he beams. He is an absolute Liz Hurley when it comes to publicity. </p> <p>He became president of the BBFC two years ago, and until that moment he had never been a consumer of pornography in any form. What, really, never - not at school, not in the Army, never ever ever? 'No. I'd never seen a sex video in my life. The first one I saw - which wasn't strictly speaking a sex video - astonished me hugely. It was called Pregnant and Milking No 5 - it was the number five that got me! So I looked at this thing and I discovered that there is a genre, which some men pay money to see, which is of pregnant women very dolefully and unenergetically stripping and fondling their breasts - that's all they do. I was very new to the job; I didn't know the rules at all. So I thought, oh dear, we can't have this in ordinary shops -- we'd better make it R18. So that's what I did. I now know that that was a completely wrong decision - it's not like hard porn where the camera is about one inch from the action - but it still languishes in R18.' </p> <p>I must say I find it weird discussing blue films with Andreas - I keep wanting to hoot and snigger and shout 'weyhay'! He was my boss for three years when I worked on the Independent on Sunday, and although I knew he was not the sanctimonious prig depicted in Private Eye, I don't think we could have discussed Pregnant and Milking in those days - or certainly not with the suavity he brings to it now. But he says one of the things he likes about this job is the complete absence of cant. 'If we say to the distributors, \"There's not a shred of a plot here of any kind,\" they say, \"No there isn't. We didn't intend there to be.\"' </p> <p>Most of his job consists of classifying videos as suitable either for general release, R18 release (to sex shops only) or no release at all, and there is a very precise legal framework for making these decisions. Classifying cinema films is a comparatively minor part of his work - 700 films a year as against 7,000 videos - and so far he has shown no inclination to cut anything, as he made clear from the beginning when he licensed Lolita uncut. He believes that cinema-goers broadly know what they're getting and 'I think at 18 adults should make up their own minds. Of course I'm sure 16- and 17-year-olds are running into 18 films but I don't think 12-year-olds are; I think it's quite well policed. And no other country comes up to 18 - most of them stop at 17. We are the most highly censored country in the world.' </p> <p>Alexander Walker (the Evening Standard 's film critic) had 50 fits last year when Andreas passed the French film Romance complete with full-frontal erections. 'Allow one pioneering male sex organ to rear its head,' he shrieked, 'and suddenly dozens more will come out of hiding.' (Actually, Walker was too coy to mention it, but there was ejaculation as well.) But Andreas is unconcerned - he thinks there probably will be more onscreen erections but only when the public is ready for them. 'The public is becoming less tolerant of violence on film - and you can see this in that the Hollywood action heroes aren't getting roles any longer. But the public continues to become more relaxed about sexual explicitness - that tide has not turned. So slightly more explicit stuff will gradually seep through. Because guidelines reflect what we can read as public opinion and if public opinion is slowly becoming more relaxed, then we will too.' </p> <p>Apparently Jack Straw approves. According to Andreas, 'I have a very good relationship with the Home Secretary.' </p> <p>Not all the issues are about sex and violence. There's a genre of videos at the moment that are offcuts of television news footage, which no one dares show on a regular news programme - people running out of houses burning, or the police opening a door and finding someone hanging. Andreas again is permissive. 'I have to say, I'm sympathetic to showing it. I suppose it's my news instinct - I think, well that's what happens. People do run out of fires burning. It isn't acting. It isn't a story encouraging violence, it's real.' </p> <p>He has a team of 20 examiners who classify most of the films, but he watches the one or two a week that are 'problematic'. He has just passed Pasolini's Salo which has never been licensed in this country and refused to make cuts. 'What you find with a good film-maker - it's like with good prose - you can't cut it. Secondly, the best film-makers, when you look carefully, suggest everything, they don't actually show it. You think you've seen all sorts of things, but you haven't really. And censors can only deal with what we see.' </p> <p>So has he been depraved and corrupted by watching all these dirty movies? Has he started fantasising about having sex with goats? 'No - but I don't think you ever get hardened to it. It's very like going to the dentist. You've got this date - 11 o'clock, Wednesday morning. And often you know it's going to be pretty tough, and you think \"ohmigod\". I always ask, \"How long is it?\" and if there's a lot of time spent on the introductory stuff, I think, oh that's good, 10 minutes gone! And then quite often of course it's nowhere near as bad as you fear. But when it is bad, I definitely feel as if my mind has been soiled. I come out of the Board and walk towards Tottenham Court Road tube station. And as I pass people in the street I've still got the film going in my head, and these people are part of it somehow. The only word I can think of is soiled.' </p> <p>Does he find gay films difficult? 'Yes, I think I'd have to say I find it even harder to watch a gay film than I do a heterosexual one, but that's just me. They can be very sado-masochistic and often run into greater problems for that reason.' The video he found hardest of all to watch was one about body piercing - 'It showed everything - it showed the bolt going through, it showed the operations. And it ended up with men - I don't think women do it - men having hooks placed in their backs - apparently the skin is strong enough - and then they're dangled from some sort of pulley arrangement, hanging from these hooks on their back, and revolve. They're looking for an out-of-body experience, so they say. And perhaps they achieve it, I don't know. Well, that was a new one! I knew nothing about that!' </p> <p>Conversely, does he ever get turned on by these videos? 'No, not by sex videos because they're too up close. They are fantastically unnatural. And one mark of that is that I can never remember individual titles. If someone says, \"Do you remember Office Tarts ?\" I don't. I remember the genre well enough, but they're all the same. I can easily be turned on by a beautiful or romantic comedy with fairly explicit sex, sure, but not by that. I need a bit of class to be turned on!' And he utters his strange barking laugh. </p> <p>The great thing to remember about Andreas Whittam Smith is that he may look like a bishop, he may on occasions talk like a bishop, but he is not a bishop. True, he is a clergyman's son (as were seemingly half the staff of the Independent in his day) and he takes his religion seriously. But his high-minded puritanism is mixed with a wacky iconoclasm, or what Glover calls his Baader-Meinhof streak. He can do gravitas in spades, but there is also a flighty, flouncy side, subject to strange tantrums and vanities, delighted by gossip, thrilled when Pamella Bordes once came to the Independent office, happy to pose for Annie Liebovitz with a golden eagle on his arm, and always eager for any excuse to open champagne. Sebastian Faulks, who was at the Independent from the beginning, recalls him as an inspiring editor and says that 'to me he seemed a bit like the Jack Nicholson character in Easy Rider: a real straight who had suddenly been given his head'. </p> <p>Rupert Murdoch said he had 'the charisma of a poached egg'. On the other hand, everyone who worked on the Independent was obsessed by him and would try to read the runes of his ever-changing complexion - was mauve a good sign? Was it better to ask for a rise when he was mildly pink or positively white? I always thought he was an actor manqu\u00e9 but he says, on the contrary, he would hate to be an actor, and he actually has a recurring nightmare in which he is made to act and 'I haven't learned my lines, we're just about to start, and I'm going to have to go on stage and look a complete and utter clown'. That's an imposter dream, I tell him. 'Exactly, yes.' So is he an imposter? People who believed in his bishop image were always terribly shocked when they came across his flighty side and accused him of being a hypocrite. But, as he says, it's not his fault if people read him wrong. </p> <p>He doesn't understand how he ever got this bishop image: 'I'd like to shake it off - I don't really want to go around looking like a bishop. My greatest desire has been to be cosmopolitan and it shattered me one day when the then editor of La Repubblica said \"Andreas, whenever I think of an Englishman I think of you\". I thought, \"My God - all this time I've tried to be cosmopolitan!\" And when I was feeling very metropolitan one day I went to Harrods to get my hair cut, and as I lay back in the chair, the barber said, \"Up from the country, sir?\" And I hadn't moved out of the city for six months! So I can't achieve the self-image I want. I'd like to be either cosmopolitan or metropolitan or both really - a man of the world, at ease everywhere in the world. The nearest I came to it was when the Daily Mail was really cross with me about Lolita; the leader was a big attack, which ended up by describing me as \"this urbane liberal\" and I was so pleased with the urbane! That's the only thing I can set against this wretched bishop image.' </p> <p>He is about to become more cosmopolitan because he and his wife have just started 'an experiment in two-city living', which means she lives in a rented flat in Paris during the week and he joins her at weekends. It sounds rather lonely for him, but he says, 'I've got lots to do, my oldest son is often here and we're slowly turning it into a men's club - it's like a men's club without any members at the moment.' </p> <p>He is 63 but has no thought of retiring. When he left the Independent in 1994 he decided to plan his life on the basis that he had 30 more working years ahead of him. 'Some people have a fear of death, which I don't. But I do have a very deep, powerful fear of not working. The notion of retirement has no attraction of any kind - I can't understand it when people my age start going on cruises. I know I shall always work whatever happens. So that tells you something about what drives me.

      "bodyText": "Andreas Whittam Smith leapt into the limelight again the other day - the Bishop as Batman - by saying there should be sex shops in every town. His argument was perfectly logical. As president of the British Board of Film Classification, he oversees a species of video-rated 'Restricted 18' that can only be sold in licensed sex shops. But if there is no licensed shop in an area - and there are very few outside Soho - porn-seekers go to illegal traders who sell videos out of the backs of cars and mix paedophile and bestial material along with the normal hardcore. So Andreas believes local authorities should control and supervise the trade rather than ignore it, by encouraging the establishment of sex shops. Like so many of Andreas's arguments, this is on the one hand sensible and on the other hand slightly mad, or at any rate unrealistic. Naturally it sent the Daily Mail into a screaming frenzy. Stephen Glover, his old adversary from The Independent, accused him of wanting to sweep a tide of filth through every high street, so that you couldn't pop out for a loaf of bread without confronting 'window displays of mind-boggling sexual contraptions'. Other papers took up the hue and cry but Andreas, far from being alarmed by the clamour, was delighted. 'There was even a cartoon in The Sun !' he beams. He is an absolute Liz Hurley when it comes to publicity. He became president of the BBFC two years ago, and until that moment he had never been a consumer of pornography in any form. What, really, never - not at school, not in the Army, never ever ever? 'No. I'd never seen a sex video in my life. The first one I saw - which wasn't strictly speaking a sex video - astonished me hugely. It was called Pregnant and Milking No 5 - it was the number five that got me! So I looked at this thing and I discovered that there is a genre, which some men pay money to see, which is of pregnant women very dolefully and unenergetically stripping and fondling their breasts - that's all they do. I was very new to the job; I didn't know the rules at all. So I thought, oh dear, we can't have this in ordinary shops -- we'd better make it R18. So that's what I did. I now know that that was a completely wrong decision - it's not like hard porn where the camera is about one inch from the action - but it still languishes in R18.' I must say I find it weird discussing blue films with Andreas - I keep wanting to hoot and snigger and shout 'weyhay'! He was my boss for three years when I worked on the Independent on Sunday, and although I knew he was not the sanctimonious prig depicted in Private Eye, I don't think we could have discussed Pregnant and Milking in those days - or certainly not with the suavity he brings to it now. But he says one of the things he likes about this job is the complete absence of cant. 'If we say to the distributors, \"There's not a shred of a plot here of any kind,\" they say, \"No there isn't. We didn't intend there to be.\"' Most of his job consists of classifying videos as suitable either for general release, R18 release (to sex shops only) or no release at all, and there is a very precise legal framework for making these decisions. Classifying cinema films is a comparatively minor part of his work - 700 films a year as against 7,000 videos - and so far he has shown no inclination to cut anything, as he made clear from the beginning when he licensed Lolita uncut. He believes that cinema-goers broadly know what they're getting and 'I think at 18 adults should make up their own minds. Of course I'm sure 16- and 17-year-olds are running into 18 films but I don't think 12-year-olds are; I think it's quite well policed. And no other country comes up to 18 - most of them stop at 17. We are the most highly censored country in the world.' Alexander Walker (the Evening Standard 's film critic) had 50 fits last year when Andreas passed the French film Romance complete with full-frontal erections. 'Allow one pioneering male sex organ to rear its head,' he shrieked, 'and suddenly dozens more will come out of hiding.' (Actually, Walker was too coy to mention it, but there was ejaculation as well.) But Andreas is unconcerned - he thinks there probably will be more onscreen erections but only when the public is ready for them. 'The public is becoming less tolerant of violence on film - and you can see this in that the Hollywood action heroes aren't getting roles any longer. But the public continues to become more relaxed about sexual explicitness - that tide has not turned. So slightly more explicit stuff will gradually seep through. Because guidelines reflect what we can read as public opinion and if public opinion is slowly becoming more relaxed, then we will too.' Apparently Jack Straw approves. According to Andreas, 'I have a very good relationship with the Home Secretary.' Not all the issues are about sex and violence. There's a genre of videos at the moment that are offcuts of television news footage, which no one dares show on a regular news programme - people running out of houses burning, or the police opening a door and finding someone hanging. Andreas again is permissive. 'I have to say, I'm sympathetic to showing it. I suppose it's my news instinct - I think, well that's what happens. People do run out of fires burning. It isn't acting. It isn't a story encouraging violence, it's real.' He has a team of 20 examiners who classify most of the films, but he watches the one or two a week that are 'problematic'. He has just passed Pasolini's Salo which has never been licensed in this country and refused to make cuts. 'What you find with a good film-maker - it's like with good prose - you can't cut it. Secondly, the best film-makers, when you look carefully, suggest everything, they don't actually show it. You think you've seen all sorts of things, but you haven't really. And censors can only deal with what we see.' So has he been depraved and corrupted by watching all these dirty movies? Has he started fantasising about having sex with goats? 'No - but I don't think you ever get hardened to it. It's very like going to the dentist. You've got this date - 11 o'clock, Wednesday morning. And often you know it's going to be pretty tough, and you think \"ohmigod\". I always ask, \"How long is it?\" and if there's a lot of time spent on the introductory stuff, I think, oh that's good, 10 minutes gone! And then quite often of course it's nowhere near as bad as you fear. But when it is bad, I definitely feel as if my mind has been soiled. I come out of the Board and walk towards Tottenham Court Road tube station. And as I pass people in the street I've still got the film going in my head, and these people are part of it somehow. The only word I can think of is soiled.' Does he find gay films difficult? 'Yes, I think I'd have to say I find it even harder to watch a gay film than I do a heterosexual one, but that's just me. They can be very sado-masochistic and often run into greater problems for that reason.' The video he found hardest of all to watch was one about body piercing - 'It showed everything - it showed the bolt going through, it showed the operations. And it ended up with men - I don't think women do it - men having hooks placed in their backs - apparently the skin is strong enough - and then they're dangled from some sort of pulley arrangement, hanging from these hooks on their back, and revolve. They're looking for an out-of-body experience, so they say. And perhaps they achieve it, I don't know. Well, that was a new one! I knew nothing about that!' Conversely, does he ever get turned on by these videos? 'No, not by sex videos because they're too up close. They are fantastically unnatural. And one mark of that is that I can never remember individual titles. If someone says, \"Do you remember Office Tarts ?\" I don't. I remember the genre well enough, but they're all the same. I can easily be turned on by a beautiful or romantic comedy with fairly explicit sex, sure, but not by that. I need a bit of class to be turned on!' And he utters his strange barking laugh. The great thing to remember about Andreas Whittam Smith is that he may look like a bishop, he may on occasions talk like a bishop, but he is not a bishop. True, he is a clergyman's son (as were seemingly half the staff of the Independent in his day) and he takes his religion seriously. But his high-minded puritanism is mixed with a wacky iconoclasm, or what Glover calls his Baader-Meinhof streak. He can do gravitas in spades, but there is also a flighty, flouncy side, subject to strange tantrums and vanities, delighted by gossip, thrilled when Pamella Bordes once came to the Independent office, happy to pose for Annie Liebovitz with a golden eagle on his arm, and always eager for any excuse to open champagne. Sebastian Faulks, who was at the Independent from the beginning, recalls him as an inspiring editor and says that 'to me he seemed a bit like the Jack Nicholson character in Easy Rider: a real straight who had suddenly been given his head'. Rupert Murdoch said he had 'the charisma of a poached egg'. On the other hand, everyone who worked on the Independent was obsessed by him and would try to read the runes of his ever-changing complexion - was mauve a good sign? Was it better to ask for a rise when he was mildly pink or positively white? I always thought he was an actor manqu\u00e9 but he says, on the contrary, he would hate to be an actor, and he actually has a recurring nightmare in which he is made to act and 'I haven't learned my lines, we're just about to start, and I'm going to have to go on stage and look a complete and utter clown'. That's an imposter dream, I tell him. 'Exactly, yes.' So is he an imposter? People who believed in his bishop image were always terribly shocked when they came across his flighty side and accused him of being a hypocrite. But, as he says, it's not his fault if people read him wrong. He doesn't understand how he ever got this bishop image: 'I'd like to shake it off - I don't really want to go around looking like a bishop. My greatest desire has been to be cosmopolitan and it shattered me one day when the then editor of La Repubblica said \"Andreas, whenever I think of an Englishman I think of you\". I thought, \"My God - all this time I've tried to be cosmopolitan!\" And when I was feeling very metropolitan one day I went to Harrods to get my hair cut, and as I lay back in the chair, the barber said, \"Up from the country, sir?\" And I hadn't moved out of the city for six months! So I can't achieve the self-image I want. I'd like to be either cosmopolitan or metropolitan or both really - a man of the world, at ease everywhere in the world. The nearest I came to it was when the Daily Mail was really cross with me about Lolita; the leader was a big attack, which ended up by describing me as \"this urbane liberal\" and I was so pleased with the urbane! That's the only thing I can set against this wretched bishop image.' He is about to become more cosmopolitan because he and his wife have just started 'an experiment in two-city living', which means she lives in a rented flat in Paris during the week and he joins her at weekends. It sounds rather lonely for him, but he says, 'I've got lots to do, my oldest son is often here and we're slowly turning it into a men's club - it's like a men's club without any members at the moment.' He is 63 but has no thought of retiring. When he left the Independent in 1994 he decided to plan his life on the basis that he had 30 more working years ahead of him. 'Some people have a fear of death, which I don't. But I do have a very deep, powerful fear of not working. The notion of retirement has no attraction of any kind - I can't understand it when people my age start going on cruises. I know I shall always work whatever happens. So that tells you something about what drives me. It's not to do with accumulating money, it's to do with a sort of puritanical view, I think, that I always wish to contribute in some minor way. And maybe that comes from the vicarage.'",

      "body": "<p>I've been giving the local bottle bank a real pounding over the past couple of weeks. Corkscrew in one hand, spittoon in the other, I've tasted my way through around 1,000 wines. Add to that the bottles I've sampled in the course of my normal working life (someone has to do it) and I reckon I've sniffed and gurgled something like 3,000 wines in the past six months. My tooth enamel might not appreciate it, but it's the only way to gauge what's out there in the market.</p> <p>My Christmas selection brings together wines from 11 different countries. I've avoided the temptation to select weird wines for the sake of it (no Kenyan Primitivo, no Danish Furmint) and concentrated on solid drinking at every price point instead. All of the major wine-drinking countries are represented, except New Zealand (a surprise) and (rather more predictably, given its inability to deliver value for money) the United States. The top dog, with nine wines out of the 36, is France, reflecting my Francophilia and the fact that the Frogs still make the best wines on the planet. Italy and Australia have five wines apiece; Germany (a comeback?), South Africa, Chile all have three slots; Portugal, Spain and Argentina two, and Austria and Hungary one each.</p> <p>As usual, I've concentrated on three broad price bands in an attempt to cover every Yuletide eventuality, from casual drinks with the neighbours to a splendid Christmas lunch. I've only recommended one fizz, because you've probably still got lots left over from last year. With two exceptions, one red and one white, I've also avoided the nether reaches of the wine market. It's possible to find palatable stuff under \u00a33.50, but, believe me, you have to work very, very hard. Just ask the people who clear my local bottle bank.</p> <p><strong>Too good to share - more than \u00a310</strong></p> <p><strong>Whites</strong></p> <p><strong>Waitrose Blancs de Noirs NV Champagne</strong> (\u00a311.99). The Champagne I'll be pouring at home this Christmas isn't one of the fancy names, but this brilliant-value Pinot Noir fizz from the Aube district. Extremely drinkable with hints of strawberry and chocolate.</p> <p><strong>1998 Saint Romain, Nicolas Potel</strong> (\u00a312.99, Marks &amp; Spencer). Nicolas Potel is a comparative newcomer to the Burgundian merchant scene, but he's already released a number of excellent wines typified by this minerally, tightly focused Chardonnay.</p> <p><strong>1999 Heggies Viognier</strong> (from \u00a312.99, Oddbins Fine Wine; The Wine Society; Fortnum &amp; Mason; Selfridges). Yalumba (owners of the Heggies brand) is leading the Viognier field in Australia at the moment. This cool-climate white is rich and creamy with intense flavours of apricot and ripe peach.</p> <p><strong>Amontillado Pastrana, Hidalgo</strong> (\u00a314.95, Berry Brothers &amp; Rudd, 0870 900 4300). An amber-hued sherry from one of the great names of Sanl\u00facar, matured for more than a decade in cask to develop almondy flavours of remarkable complexity. </p> <p><strong>Henriques &amp; Henriques Bual 10-year-old, Madeira</strong> (\u00a317.99, Laithwaites, 0870 444 8383). Another stunning fortified wine from Iberia whose price reflects the unfashionability of Madeira. A sweetish, mahogany-tinged Bual with marked acidity and the slightly singed character typical of the island's wines. This will age for ever.</p> <p><strong>1998 Kracher Nouvelle Vague, TBA, Grande Cuv\u00e9e No 10 </strong>(\u00a324.99 per half, Noel Young Wines, 01223 844 744; Reid Wines, 01761 452 645). \u00a325 might seem a lot to pay for half-a-bottle of sweet Austrian wine, but Alois Kracher's stickies have been compared with the likes of Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem. This oak and botrytis-intense blend is delicious.</p> <p><strong>Reds</strong></p> <p><strong>1998 Ch\u00e2teau La Rose Brisson, St Emilion Grand Cru</strong> (\u00a310.99, Safeway). Half of the wines made in St Emilion are unworthy of the famous appellation, but this is a humdinger from a pretty good vintage on the Right Bank.</p> <p><strong>1999 Altos Las Hormigas Malbec Reserva </strong>(\u00a314, Justerini &amp; Brooks, 0207 493 8721). Made by superstar Alberto Antonini from grapes grown 800 metres above sea level in Mendoza, Argentina, this is one of South America's best reds, with tobaccoey, plummy fruit balanced by acidity and fine tannins.</p> <p><strong>1998 Tancredi, Contessa Entellina, Donnafugata</strong> (\u00a314.50, Vino Vino, 07703 436 949). Giacomo Rallo's wines are some of the best in Sicily, especially Tancredi, an aristocratic blend of Nero d'Avola and Cabernet. The two grapes are harmoniously matched in this structured, plum, blackcurrant and black cherry-like red.</p> <p><strong>1997 Rosemount Estates GSM </strong>(\u00a314.87, Asda, Wine Rack, Waitrose, Bottoms Up). GSM stands for Grenache, Shiraz and Mourv\u00e8dre, the core grapes of the southern Rh\u00f4ne, transplanted to McLaren Vale in Australia. Philip Shaw has fashioned a typically stylish, concentrated red with lashings of oak.</p> <p><strong>1998 Err\u00e1zuriz Don Maximiano Cabernet Sauvignon</strong> (\u00a319.99, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up, Tesco, Victoria Wine, Thresher, Unwins). The price may have gone up in the last three years, but Don Max is still one hell of a wine, easily a match for its more expensive Chilean competitors. A rich, minty, multi-faceted wine that will develop over the next 10 years into something truly special.</p> <p><strong>1986 Dow's Quinta do Bonfim</strong> (\u00a319.99, Majestic, Sainsbury's, Tesco, Bottoms Up, Wine Rack, Oddbins). An overlooked year in the Douro, 1986 nevertheless produced some splendid single quinta wines such as this one. Rich, spicy, peppery stuff. </p> <p><strong>For friends and family: \u00a35 to \u00a310</strong></p> <p><strong>Whites</strong></p> <p><strong>1999 Icardi Balera Cortese, Piemonte</strong> (\u00a35.99, Oddbins). Cortese is one of Italy's more interesting white varieties. When it's well done, it can be quite delicious. This one is packed with flavours of clove, apple and pear, with the variety's zippy acidity and attractive perfume to the fore.</p> <p><strong>1999 Pewsey Vale Riesling </strong>(\u00a35.99, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up). Australian Riesling is one of the New World's most undervalued wines. This elegant, concentrated, lime-like dry white is as close to Alsace Riesling as Australia gets. Minerally, fresh and beautifully poised.</p> <p><strong>1999 Hilltop Virgin Vintage Sauvignon Blanc</strong> (\u00a35.99, Safeway). Hungary is not the first place you'd expect to find a Sauvignon Blanc as good as this, but Akos Kamocsay is no ordinary winemaker. This intense, grapefruit and gooseberry-like white is like a cross between a Kiwi Sauvignon and a Sancerre.</p> <p><strong>1998 Ch\u00e2teau de Nages, Cuv\u00e9e Joseph Torres, Costi\u00e8res de N\u00eemes</strong> (\u00a36.99, Oddbins). Situated in the comparatively unfashionable Costi\u00e8res de N\u00eemes appellation, Ch\u00e2teau de Nages is one of the best producers in southern France. This toasty, rich, textured Roussanne white is an absolute stunner.</p> <p><strong>1999 Thandi Chardonnay</strong> (\u00a36.99, Tesco). In winemaking terms, Thandi in Elgin is by far the best of the Cape's empowerment projects. This finely crafted, barrel-fermented Chardonnay has lovely cool-climate finesse. Very Burgundian in style with notes of butter, nut and lemon zest.</p> <p><strong>1990 Erdener Treppchen Riesling Auslese, Stephan Ehlen</strong> (\u00a38.99, Waitrose). Mature Mosel Rieslings from top vineyard sites are something of a Waitrose speciality. This light-fingered, old, oak-matured white is petrolly and complex, with delightful balance between acidity, alcohol and honeyed sweetness.</p> <p><strong>Reds</strong></p> <p><strong>1999 Dornfelder, Lergenmuller, Pfalz</strong> (\u00a35.49, Waitrose). German reds are something of a minority taste, but this blend of Dornfelder with 15 per cent Pinot Noir has good colour, juicy black cherry and damson fruit flavours and sweet tannins. One to trick your friends with.</p> <p><strong>1999 Beaujolais Villages, Domaine de la Plaigne</strong> (\u00a35.99, Majestic; on special offer at two for \u00a35.49 per bottle until 29 January). Beaujolais Nouveau might have died a sorry death in the UK, but if you still enjoy a glass of Gamay this is wonderfully juicy stuff, with a perfumed flourish.</p> <p><strong>1998 Jaboulet C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne Villages</strong> (\u00a35.99, Tesco). Jaboulet is better known for its northern Rh\u00f4ne reds than its southern blends, but this is one of the best sub-\u00a36 wines I've drunk this year. A peppery, powerful, Grenache-based red with alluring aromas of Mediterranean herbs and spices.</p> <p><strong>1998 Valdivieso Cabernet Sauvignon Reserva</strong> (\u00a36.99, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up, Victoria Wine, Thresher, Sainsbury's, Tesco). A gold medal winner at this year's International Wine Challenge, this tastes more like a \u00a310 wine. It's a dark, brooding, blackberryish red with plenty of structure and the potential to age for another five years at least.</p> <p><strong>1999 Shiraz/Grenache, Christa Rolf, Barossa Valley</strong> (\u00a38.65, Lay &amp; Wheeler, 01206 764 446). The top Barossa Valley reds have shot up in price in recent months thanks to high-octane reviews in the US, but not this one. A muscular, concentrated blend from the Binder siblings with a silky core of raspberry and blackcurrant fruit.</p> <p><strong>1998 Domaine de Pavillon-Mercurol, Crozes-Hermitage</strong> (\u00a38.99, Oddbins). No apologies for choosing a second 1998 Rh\u00f4ne red in my \u00a35-10 selection. If the C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne Villages is all about warmth and generosity, this is a more focused Syrah red with ripe tannins and plenty of oak.</p> <p><strong>For making merry - under \u00a35</strong></p> <p><strong> Whites </strong></p> <p><strong>1998 Domaine Sainte Agathe Chardonnay, Vin de Pays d'Oc </strong> (\u00a33.29, Somerfield, until 2 January). Super value Languedoc Chardonnay from the house of Maurel Vedeau showing ripe tropical fruit flavours of mango and peach and a whisper of oak. A full-bodied white with plenty of concentration. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Con Class Selecci\u00f3n Especial </strong> (\u00a33.99, Tesco). A highly distinctive blend of Viura, Verdejo and Sauvignon Blanc from Rueda in northern Spain, which shows that Iberian whites don't have to be as flat and baked as the plain of La Mancha. Zesty, grapefruity and full of charm. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Terra Viva Organic Soave </strong> (\u00a34.49, Tesco). Italian white wines usually score high on my personal snooze-ometer, but this organic Soave is a wonderful exception. It's nutty, appley and unoaked with just the right amount of acidity for balance. </p> <p><strong> 2000 Spier Chenin Blanc </strong> (\u00a34.49, Asda). There's an ocean of Chenin Blanc in South Africa these days, but very little of it tastes anywhere near as good as this mealy, waxy, honeyed white with its straw/hay aromas and well-balanced oak. A rich, textured white with real personality. </p> <p><strong> 2000 Santa Julia Viognier </strong> (from \u00a34.79, Sainsbury's, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up). Who says it's impossible to make drinkable Viognier for under \u00a35? From the ultra-reliable Santa Julia operation in Argentina, this is a stylish, full-bodied, well-made white with notes of peach and apricot jam </p> <p><strong> 1999 Lingenfelder Riesling, QbA </strong> (\u00a34.99, Oddbins). A splendid entry-point Riesling from one of Germany's most individual producers. A year in bottle has allowed the wine to develop extra depth and complexity. Floral, off-dry and enticingly fruity. </p> <p> <strong> Reds </strong></p> <p><strong> 1999 Chianti La Capannuccia </strong> (\u00a32.99, Sainsbury's). I'm not sure what the Italians would make of a Chianti at such a low price, but this is surprisingly drinkable stuff. A medium-weight red with the characteristic cherry/plum skin characters of Sangiovese and a rasp of pasta-friendly tannin. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Co-op Australian Grenache </strong> (\u00a33.29 until 7 January). At its knockdown Christmas price, this has to be one of the best-value Aussie reds this side of the Great Barrier Reef. A minty, easy-drinking quaffer with soft tannins and ripe, sunny flavours. Quintessential Aussie Grenache. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Domaine Monpertuis, C\u00e9page Counoise, Vin de Pays du Gard </strong> (\u00a34.49, Marks &amp; Spencer). Usually restricted to a spear-carrying role in the south of France, the comparatively rare Counoise is promoted to star status in this meaty, unoaked, finely wrought southern French red. </p> <p><strong> 2000 Beyerskloof Pinotage, Stellenbosch </strong> (\u00a34.99, Asda). Made by the king of South African Pinotage, Beyers Truter, this has the telltale liquorice and baked banana aromas of the Cape's most unusual red grape. The balance between sweet raspberry fruit and oak is really well done. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Italia </strong> (\u00a34.99, Safeway, Wine Cellar, Virginwines.com). The importers of this wine won't tell me what it's in this hefty, southern Italian bottle, but I'm not sure you should worry. The wine is ripe and faintly raisiny with a smidgeon of oak. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Porta Merlot, Maipo Valley </strong> (\u00a34.99, Unwins). There's a lot of good Chilean Merlot at under \u00a35, but this came top of my tasting. It's a lively, well-balanced red, which relies on fruit concentration rather than oak for its impact. Lively and refreshing with fine tannins and bright-eyed cassis fruit characters.</p>",

Add to that the bottles I've sampled in the course of my normal working life (someone has to do it) and I reckon I've sniffed and gurgled something like 3,000 wines in the past six months. My tooth enamel might not appreciate it, but it's the only way to gauge what's out there in the market. My Christmas selection brings together wines from 11 different countries. I've avoided the temptation to select weird wines for the sake of it (no Kenyan Primitivo, no Danish Furmint) and concentrated on solid drinking at every price point instead. All of the major wine-drinking countries are represented, except New Zealand (a surprise) and (rather more predictably, given its inability to deliver value for money) the United States. The top dog, with nine wines out of the 36, is France, reflecting my Francophilia and the fact that the Frogs still make the best wines on the planet. Italy and Australia have five wines apiece; Germany (a comeback?), South Africa, Chile all have three slots; Portugal, Spain and Argentina two, and Austria and Hungary one each. As usual, I've concentrated on three broad price bands in an attempt to cover every Yuletide eventuality, from casual drinks with the neighbours to a splendid Christmas lunch. I've only recommended one fizz, because you've probably still got lots left over from last year. With two exceptions, one red and one white, I've also avoided the nether reaches of the wine market. It's possible to find palatable stuff under \u00a33.50, but, believe me, you have to work very, very hard. Just ask the people who clear my local bottle bank. Too good to share - more than \u00a310 Whites Waitrose Blancs de Noirs NV Champagne (\u00a311.99). The Champagne I'll be pouring at home this Christmas isn't one of the fancy names, but this brilliant-value Pinot Noir fizz from the Aube district. Extremely drinkable with hints of strawberry and chocolate. 1998 Saint Romain, Nicolas Potel (\u00a312.99, Marks &amp; Spencer). Nicolas Potel is a comparative newcomer to the Burgundian merchant scene, but he's already released a number of excellent wines typified by this minerally, tightly focused Chardonnay. 1999 Heggies Viognier (from \u00a312.99, Oddbins Fine Wine; The Wine Society; Fortnum &amp; Mason; Selfridges). Yalumba (owners of the Heggies brand) is leading the Viognier field in Australia at the moment. This cool-climate white is rich and creamy with intense flavours of apricot and ripe peach. Amontillado Pastrana, Hidalgo (\u00a314.95, Berry Brothers &amp; Rudd, 0870 900 4300). An amber-hued sherry from one of the great names of Sanl\u00facar, matured for more than a decade in cask to develop almondy flavours of remarkable complexity. Henriques &amp; Henriques Bual 10-year-old, Madeira (\u00a317.99, Laithwaites, 0870 444 8383). Another stunning fortified wine from Iberia whose price reflects the unfashionability of Madeira. A sweetish, mahogany-tinged Bual with marked acidity and the slightly singed character typical of the island's wines. This will age for ever. 1998 Kracher Nouvelle Vague, TBA, Grande Cuv\u00e9e No 10 (\u00a324.99 per half, Noel Young Wines, 01223 844 744; Reid Wines, 01761 452 645). \u00a325 might seem a lot to pay for half-a-bottle of sweet Austrian wine, but Alois Kracher's stickies have been compared with the likes of Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem. This oak and botrytis-intense blend is delicious. Reds 1998 Ch\u00e2teau La Rose Brisson, St Emilion Grand Cru (\u00a310.99, Safeway). Half of the wines made in St Emilion are unworthy of the famous appellation, but this is a humdinger from a pretty good vintage on the Right Bank. 1999 Altos Las Hormigas Malbec Reserva (\u00a314, Justerini &amp; Brooks, 0207 493 8721). Made by superstar Alberto Antonini from grapes grown 800 metres above sea level in Mendoza, Argentina, this is one of South America's best reds, with tobaccoey, plummy fruit balanced by acidity and fine tannins. 1998 Tancredi, Contessa Entellina, Donnafugata (\u00a314.50, Vino Vino, 07703 436 949). Giacomo Rallo's wines are some of the best in Sicily, especially Tancredi, an aristocratic blend of Nero d'Avola and Cabernet. The two grapes are harmoniously matched in this structured, plum, blackcurrant and black cherry-like red. 1997 Rosemount Estates GSM (\u00a314.87, Asda, Wine Rack, Waitrose, Bottoms Up). GSM stands for Grenache, Shiraz and Mourv\u00e8dre, the core grapes of the southern Rh\u00f4ne, transplanted to McLaren Vale in Australia. Philip Shaw has fashioned a typically stylish, concentrated red with lashings of oak. 1998 Err\u00e1zuriz Don Maximiano Cabernet Sauvignon (\u00a319.99, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up, Tesco, Victoria Wine, Thresher, Unwins). The price may have gone up in the last three years, but Don Max is still one hell of a wine, easily a match for its more expensive Chilean competitors. A rich, minty, multi-faceted wine that will develop over the next 10 years into something truly special. 1986 Dow's Quinta do Bonfim (\u00a319.99, Majestic, Sainsbury's, Tesco, Bottoms Up, Wine Rack, Oddbins). An overlooked year in the Douro, 1986 nevertheless produced some splendid single quinta wines such as this one. Rich, spicy, peppery stuff. For friends and family: \u00a35 to \u00a310 Whites 1999 Icardi Balera Cortese, Piemonte (\u00a35.99, Oddbins). Cortese is one of Italy's more interesting white varieties. When it's well done, it can be quite delicious. This one is packed with flavours of clove, apple and pear, with the variety's zippy acidity and attractive perfume to the fore. 1999 Pewsey Vale Riesling (\u00a35.99, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up). Australian Riesling is one of the New World's most undervalued wines. This elegant, concentrated, lime-like dry white is as close to Alsace Riesling as Australia gets. Minerally, fresh and beautifully poised. 1999 Hilltop Virgin Vintage Sauvignon Blanc (\u00a35.99, Safeway). Hungary is not the first place you'd expect to find a Sauvignon Blanc as good as this, but Akos Kamocsay is no ordinary winemaker. This intense, grapefruit and gooseberry-like white is like a cross between a Kiwi Sauvignon and a Sancerre. 1998 Ch\u00e2teau de Nages, Cuv\u00e9e Joseph Torres, Costi\u00e8res de N\u00eemes (\u00a36.99, Oddbins). Situated in the comparatively unfashionable Costi\u00e8res de N\u00eemes appellation, Ch\u00e2teau de Nages is one of the best producers in southern France. This toasty, rich, textured Roussanne white is an absolute stunner. 1999 Thandi Chardonnay (\u00a36.99, Tesco). In winemaking terms, Thandi in Elgin is by far the best of the Cape's empowerment projects. This finely crafted, barrel-fermented Chardonnay has lovely cool-climate finesse. Very Burgundian in style with notes of butter, nut and lemon zest. 1990 Erdener Treppchen Riesling Auslese, Stephan Ehlen (\u00a38.99, Waitrose). Mature Mosel Rieslings from top vineyard sites are something of a Waitrose speciality. This light-fingered, old, oak-matured white is petrolly and complex, with delightful balance between acidity, alcohol and honeyed sweetness. Reds 1999 Dornfelder, Lergenmuller, Pfalz (\u00a35.49, Waitrose). German reds are something of a minority taste, but this blend of Dornfelder with 15 per cent Pinot Noir has good colour, juicy black cherry and damson fruit flavours and sweet tannins. One to trick your friends with. 1999 Beaujolais Villages, Domaine de la Plaigne (\u00a35.99, Majestic; on special offer at two for \u00a35.49 per bottle until 29 January). Beaujolais Nouveau might have died a sorry death in the UK, but if you still enjoy a glass of Gamay this is wonderfully juicy stuff, with a perfumed flourish. 1998 Jaboulet C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne Villages (\u00a35.99, Tesco). Jaboulet is better known for its northern Rh\u00f4ne reds than its southern blends, but this is one of the best sub-\u00a36 wines I've drunk this year. A peppery, powerful, Grenache-based red with alluring aromas of Mediterranean herbs and spices. 1998 Valdivieso Cabernet Sauvignon Reserva (\u00a36.99, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up, Victoria Wine, Thresher, Sainsbury's, Tesco). A gold medal winner at this year's International Wine Challenge, this tastes more like a \u00a310 wine. It's a dark, brooding, blackberryish red with plenty of structure and the potential to age for another five years at least. 1999 Shiraz/Grenache, Christa Rolf, Barossa Valley (\u00a38.65, Lay &amp; Wheeler, 01206 764 446). The top Barossa Valley reds have shot up in price in recent months thanks to high-octane reviews in the US, but not this one. A muscular, concentrated blend from the Binder siblings with a silky core of raspberry and blackcurrant fruit. 1998 Domaine de Pavillon-Mercurol, Crozes-Hermitage (\u00a38.99, Oddbins). No apologies for choosing a second 1998 Rh\u00f4ne red in my \u00a35-10 selection. If the C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne Villages is all about warmth and generosity, this is a more focused Syrah red with ripe tannins and plenty of oak. For making merry - under \u00a35 Whites 1998 Domaine Sainte Agathe Chardonnay, Vin de Pays d'Oc (\u00a33.29, Somerfield, until 2 January). Super value Languedoc Chardonnay from the house of Maurel Vedeau showing ripe tropical fruit flavours of mango and peach and a whisper of oak. A full-bodied white with plenty of concentration. 1999 Con Class Selecci\u00f3n Especial (\u00a33.99, Tesco). A highly distinctive blend of Viura, Verdejo and Sauvignon Blanc from Rueda in northern Spain, which shows that Iberian whites don't have to be as flat and baked as the plain of La Mancha. Zesty, grapefruity and full of charm. 1999 Terra Viva Organic Soave (\u00a34.49, Tesco). Italian white wines usually score high on my personal snooze-ometer, but this organic Soave is a wonderful exception. It's nutty, appley and unoaked with just the right amount of acidity for balance. 2000 Spier Chenin Blanc (\u00a34.49, Asda). There's an ocean of Chenin Blanc in South Africa these days, but very little of it tastes anywhere near as good as this mealy, waxy, honeyed white with its straw/hay aromas and well-balanced oak. A rich, textured white with real personality. 2000 Santa Julia Viognier (from \u00a34.79, Sainsbury's, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up). Who says it's impossible to make drinkable Viognier for under \u00a35? From the ultra-reliable Santa Julia operation in Argentina, this is a stylish, full-bodied, well-made white with notes of peach and apricot jam 1999 Lingenfelder Riesling, QbA (\u00a34.99, Oddbins). A splendid entry-point Riesling from one of Germany's most individual producers. A year in bottle has allowed the wine to develop extra depth and complexity. Floral, off-dry and enticingly fruity. Reds 1999 Chianti La Capannuccia (\u00a32.99, Sainsbury's). I'm not sure what the Italians would make of a Chianti at such a low price, but this is surprisingly drinkable stuff. A medium-weight red with the characteristic cherry/plum skin characters of Sangiovese and a rasp of pasta-friendly tannin. 1999 Co-op Australian Grenache (\u00a33.29 until 7 January). At its knockdown Christmas price, this has to be one of the best-value Aussie reds this side of the Great Barrier Reef. A minty, easy-drinking quaffer with soft tannins and ripe, sunny flavours. Quintessential Aussie Grenache. 1999 Domaine Monpertuis, C\u00e9page Counoise, Vin de Pays du Gard (\u00a34.49, Marks &amp; Spencer). Usually restricted to a spear-carrying role in the south of France, the comparatively rare Counoise is promoted to star status in this meaty, unoaked, finely wrought southern French red. 2000 Beyerskloof Pinotage, Stellenbosch (\u00a34.99, Asda). Made by the king of South African Pinotage, Beyers Truter, this has the telltale liquorice and baked banana aromas of the Cape's most unusual red grape. The balance between sweet raspberry fruit and oak is really well done. 1999 Italia (\u00a34.99, Safeway, Wine Cellar, Virginwines.com). The importers of this wine won't tell me what it's in this hefty, southern Italian bottle, but I'm not sure you should worry. The wine is ripe and faintly raisiny with a smidgeon of oak. 1999 Porta Merlot, Maipo Valley (\u00a34.99, Unwins). There's a lot of good Chilean Merlot at under \u00a35, but this came top of my tasting. It's a lively, well-balanced red, which relies on fruit concentration rather than oak for its impact. Lively and refreshing with fine tannins and bright-eyed cassis fruit characters.",

      "body": "<p>I feel uncomfortable, if there is too much food in the house. Temptations abound more than ever this month, so December requires a ruthless edit of the shopping trolley. While there is no more satisfying retail therapy than spotting and securing a piece of Stilton or a pineapple at the summit of its long climb to perfection, this is also the season of the impulse buy - that unused, just-in-case purchase that will embarrass us every time we open the fridge. You know the scenario, 'Will someone please have a slice of that veal and ham pie?' The wily shopper knows when to say no. </p> <p>But we need to say yes, too. Especially when we come across an exquisite morsel whose time is fleeting and truly seasonal. Figs stuffed with candied peel and marzipan, perhaps, or chocolate-coated prunes from Agen, a flawless Vacherin Mont d'Or cheese, or, for the very rich, a truffle. It would just be too like Scrooge not to have something special tucked away to offer a surprise caller. </p> <p>I am having fish this year for the main Christmas meal, but many will be searching for a roast to grace their table, be it turkey, pheasant or a long, lean goose. Getting the bird on the table on time, complete with its festive decking of stuffing balls, bacon rolls and bread sauce needs precision, so what precedes it should be a plate whose success is down to expert shopping rather than culinary dexterity. The smart shopper is always ahead of the clever cook. </p> <p>I would always be thankful for smoked salmon, but could I suggest you ask the fishmonger about eel, trout or halibut, too? These need nothing more than a slick of home-made horseradish sauce. A plump fillet of smoked mackerel is an economical alternative - peeled from the skin of a whole fish, though, rather than vac-packed fillets, please. Its moist richness can be tempered by the kick of a pickled gherkin or, strange-but-true, a pool of Cumberland sauce. Those in the money could do no better than flash their black American Express card at a large tin of caviar. </p> <p>But I am getting ahead of myself. Before the starter, there will be, I hope, a bottle of bubbly. I am not a canap\u00e9 kinda guy, so this year I am passing round little strips of lardo - the white, air-cured fat of Italian pigs that is gently scented with rosemary and, sometimes, juniper. To be a treat, it must be sliced very, very thin by the purveyor. Tell him you want to be almost able to see through it. Sprinkle the translucent, pearly strips with flakes of sea salt, good olive oil and roughly crushed black peppercorns or very finely chopped rosemary. </p> <p>If this delicacy evades you or sounds altogether too carnivorous, then how about four or five (only just) hard-boiled quails' eggs and individual dishes of sea salt for dipping? You could mix celery salt or smoked paprika into the seasoning, if you like that sort of thing. I have been reluctant to mention these charming grey-and-black mottled egglets here before, as I couldn't find any that were free range. But friendly ones are appearing in farmers' markets (I get mine at the Olive Farm butter and cream stall in Islington, north London), so I am happier about suggesting them. </p> <p>Much of the best Christmas eating comes out of the ground. Frost-touched parsnips, Jerusalem artichokes and fat carrots will all roast sweetly. Eavesdropping at a foodie party the other night, I overheard Rose Gray of the River Caf\u00e9 and food-writer Colin Spencer discussing the effect of frost on Cavolo Nero, that beautiful, plume-like, blue-black cabbage. They were both adamant about the benefits of the cold on this beautiful brassica. I pass this is on to anyone who is looking for an alternative to Brussels sprouts this year. </p> <p>Red cabbage is worth a look, too. The age-old match with apple is a sound one, especially if there are juniper berries and some bacon around. Try heating some bacon fat in a heavy casserole, then throwing in a few handfuls of shredded red cabbage, an apple or two cut into segments and five or six crushed juniper berries. Splash in red wine vinegar, salt and just a little brown sugar. Cooked under a tight lid for 10 minutes or so, you will have a sweet-sour, lightly crisp vegetable to accompany turkey, ham or game. </p> <p>The Christmas cheese may well be something blue, with Stiltons, Gorgonzolas and the Irish Cashel Blue looking particularly fine at this time of year. I offer just one, in all its glory, with celery made crunchy by a dunking in iced water in the fridge for an hour beforehand. The delights of Spanish Picos, with its wrapping of vine leaves, deserves to be better known. </p> <p>The shopping list is near useless in a cheese shop at any time of year; we should go instead for whatever looks best. That may well be not blue at all, but something like the Le Fougerus Brie I found the other day, whose fern-bedecked crust undulated like a creamy-white duvet. It would have been disrespectful to have passed it by. </p> <p>My shopping bag is heavy with fruit. No featherlight punnets of raspberries at this time of year, just the tonne-weight of pineapples and pomegranates. Next time you squeeze a glass of orange juice, slice a pomegranate in half and crush that, too. Apart from the sunset colour, the blast of sweet-sharpness will wake your senses better than any alarm clock. </p> <p>The small citrus fruits ebb and flow as their seasons come round. One week clementines, the next satsumas and mandarins. Blink and you will miss the minneolas. I eat a lot of these little fruits, so I can confidently say the tighter the skin, the juicier the fruit. Baggy skin is a doddle to peel but will house fruit as dry as Old Nick. Sprightly, bottle-green leaves are a sure sign of a recent harvest. </p> <p>The bakers will already be sporting their floury aprons, but those less inclined to shake the sugar sifter may like to thumb through the season's food catalogues for their tea. Betty's of Harrogate is offering a moist and raisin-filled Christmas wreath with a topping of huge and juicy cherries, while Carluccio's is boasting a sensational hand-made panettone, the size and price of a small house. Either will cut-and-come-again throughout the feast. </p> <p>Stocking fillers should surprise and delight, and I try to make them as edible as possible, eschewing the useful for something that is pure luxury. I stuff pistachio nougat, crinkly packets of chocolate-coated almonds and wooden boxes of Turkish delight into everyone's. Then I add sweetmeats I wouldn't normally buy, such as Walnut Whips, Pontefract cakes and humbugs to give a sort of home-made selection box. (Am I the only one who remembers that, years ago, Christmas stocking-shaped selection boxes always tasted stale?) Those worried about dentist's bills can add a clementine or two. </p> <p>And what about pud? I have taken to making my own in recent years, using Eliza Acton's recipe, and very good it is. Those who cannot stir themselves (sorry) should try the ones from Valvona and Crolla in Edinburgh (valvonacrolla.com) or The Carved Angel puddings available at branches of David Mellor. </p> <p>I should remind you that Cox's apples and Doyenne du Comice pears are now at their best. Take your time with them, offering the orange-flecked and mossy green fruits with walnuts as a separate course after The Pudding. For those who quickly tire of the sweet richness of Christmas, a perfectly ripe and juicy pear, lovingly brought to tenderness, its flesh as cool and dripping as a melting sorbet, could be the gastronomic height of the season.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The London headquarters of the multi-billion-dollar Gucci fashion group just off Piccadilly were electric last weekend with excitement, or about as electric as an organisation this dedicated to the art of cool can ever be. </p> <p>Gucci is a company which thinks it awfully gauche to hang nameplates announcing its presence on its buildings. The interior of its Georgian mansion on Grafton Street contains no flashy promotional materials attesting to its burgeoning sales. Heavens darling, no. Everything here is a glacial confection of white lines and space, offset by pieces of elegant modern furniture in chocolate veneer and black calfskin. </p> <p>Nevertheless, up on the fourth floor big things were happening. Domenico de Sole, the buccaneering chief executive who, along with creative director Tom Ford, has taken Gucci from insolvency to the very heights of success in just seven years, was putting the finishing touches to an agreement with British fashion wunderkind Alexander McQueen. </p> <p>In a deal announced last Monday, Gucci is to take a 51 per cent stake in McQueen's own label company, which already has one store in London selling McQueen's jeans and is soon to roll its shops out across the world. </p> <p>By itself the news of the Gucci-McQueen deal would have made headlines, but there was one detail which made this something far more: McQueen already has a contract with a luxury brand company, Gucci's arch-rival LVMH (Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessy), where he is chief designer for the Givenchy label. </p> <p>For the past two years, Gucci and the gargantuan $60 billion LVMH have been locked in a legal battle. There have been allegations of corruption and shady deals, of gross mismanagement and bad faith. </p> <p>McQueen's deal was seen as nothing less than a major slap in the face with a crocodile-skin handbag for LVMH. For its part, Gucci denied it was meant as anything of the sort. 'We did not do this because of LVMH,' a Gucci spokesman in London said last week. 'It's part of our long-term strategy to acquire brands in the luxury market.' </p> <p>LVMH was having none of it. 'We view it as a somewhat desperate attempt to gain headlines,' said James Lieber, Director of Corporate Affairs in Paris. He then claimed that McQueen had first come to LVMH looking for the investment but that it had decided it did not make commercial sense. Nonsense, says Gucci: LVMH was never even given the chance by McQueen to make such an investment. </p> <p>As for McQueen, the 31- year-old East End boy who left school at 16 to learn his trade as a tailor, he was declining all requests for interviews, though it is well known that he had long been unhappy with the strictures placed on him by the demands of a great French design house like Givenchy. 'I'm here and [will] stay here till the end of my contract,' he told Arena magazine last month. 'But I'm taking control of it from now on. Otherwise fire me, because that's what I wanted anyway.' </p> <p>For the men in charge, McQueen's grousing and hyperbole is only a minor skirmish in a much bigger war. It began in February of last year when Bernard Arnault, the billionaire chief executive of LVMH, began buying up shares in Gucci. For Arnault-watchers it was a classic tactic. As well as Givenchy, his company already owned the fashion labels Louis Vuitton, Kenzo and Celine, among others. He had the champagne companies Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon, Krug and Veuve Clicquot, the Hennessy cognac company, the Tag Heuer watch company and the perfume business of Christian Dior. He had just finished a bitter and successful take over of Chteaux d'Yquem, producers of the most prestigious and expensive Sauterne in the world. If it was in the luxury sector, Arnault wanted it. So now he wanted Gucci. </p> <p>The appeal was obvious. By 1993 the once great Gucci brand had been driven into the ground by the cackhandedness of the increasingly dysfunctional family whose name the company carries. One Gucci, Aldo, was jailed for tax evasion; his successor, Maurizio, was assassinated by hitmen for his ex-wife. Meanwhile the company's logo, the solid 'G' that once meant so much, had been licensed to an increasingly trashy line of goods until the gleam of exclusivity had been dulled almost to extinction. </p> <p>It was this battered shell that de Sole took public in 1993. He installed the Texan designer Ford and gave him free rein to reinvigorate the brand, which he did spectacularly well, simplifying the look to something calm, smooth and, invariably, black. Licensing deals were withdrawn and the shine swiftly returned. With the acquisition of the Yves Saint Laurent brand, the Gucci group became a watchword for smart luxury, a sleek yacht to LVMH's grand ocean liner. Last year Gucci recorded sales of nearly $2.5bn (\u00a31.7bn) worldwide. </p> <p>This was the prize Arnault wanted. He swiftly purchased 34 per cent of the stock which, in a company with a divided supervising board, was enough to give him control. Gucci insisted that LVMH either make a 100 per cent bid for the whole company or sign an agreement promising it would buy no more shares. But just before discussions started, Gucci found a white knight - the French department store chain Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, headed by Arnault's arch-rival, billionaire French businessman Fran\u00e7ois Pinault. </p> <p>In return for an investment of $3bn, PPR was given 44 per cent of the company and de facto control of Gucci. Arnault, furious that his own stock holding had been diluted to just 20 per cent by the move and that the prize had therefore been stolen from him, immediately sued Gucci in the Netherlands where the company is incorporated. He alleged the Gucci-PPR deal was hugely detrimental to the interest of share holders. While the Dutch courts slapped Gucci down for the way it went about the deal, they ruled that its arrangement with PPR should stand. </p> <p>After a recent appeal by LVMH, a higher Dutch court ruled that the Gucci-PPR deal must be looked at again. In the meantime, attention has turned to more straightforward matters of hard cash. Ten days ago LVMH alleged that Gucci had failed to disclose an enormous share option deal the company had made with de Sole and Ford. LVMH claimed that, while the company had told share- holders about the overall number of share options to be offered to executives of the company, it had not revealed that 83 per cent of them went to just the two men. </p> <p>In fact, the lion's share - four million over four years out of a total of 5.25 million - goes to Ford alone, valuing him much more highly than the chief executive to whom he reports. The first tranche of a million shares mature at a price of $75 a share. On Friday the shares were trading at $87.62, down from a recent high of $121, but still enough to guarantee a profit for Ford of $12.6 million. It would be enough to buy 45,000 pairs of his double-buckled ankle boots at \u00a3280 a shot, almost 10,000 pairs of his brown leather trousers at \u00a31,280 or even a quarter of a million pairs of Gucci babies' slippers at a modest \u00a350 each, all available at the company's sleek Bond Street store. And that's only this year's take. </p> <p>LVMH has now filed charges against Gucci over the share options in the Dutch courts. James Lieber of LVMH said: 'If there have been violations of the law, I don't think seeking to have them rectified is sour grapes.' </p> <p>Alan Tuttle, chief legal counsel to Gucci, denies the charge. 'We made all the disclosures required by Dutch law.' What's more, he says, it's an excellent investment. 'Ford and de Sole are the fellows who took a company that was insolvent in 1993 and turned it into the most profitable company by margin in the luxury sector. The share- holders should be saying hurrah.' Both sides have also filed criminal defamation suits accusing each other of outrageous lying. </p> <p>What the LVMH-Gucci struggle is really about is the intricate business of flogging luxury. To give their brands the gloss that will encourage the fashion-conscious to part with hundreds of pounds for a leather-clad pen or a belt or a handbag, they need edgy, controversial designers who can attract media attention. </p> <p>Gucci has been almost entirely dependent so far on Ford's energy to get it where it is today and, as the company expands, he will need help. There are many who believe that, as soon as McQueen can extricate himself from his Givenchy contract, he will take over designing the Yves Saint Laurent line Ford has been running almost single-handed. </p> <p>Meanwhile, LVMH is left looking like a luxury brand company that cannot keep the all-important talent happy. Whatever it may say, the McQueen deal means that this round has been won by Gucci, the little guys in the luxury market, albeit the little guys worth a cool $10bn. </p> <p><strong>The kings of luxury:</strong></p> <p><strong> LVMH</strong> </p> <p>Company value: $60 billion </p> <p><strong> Fashion</strong> </p> <p>Louis Vuitton </p> <p>Loewe </p> <p>Kenzo </p> <p>Celine </p> <p>Givenchy </p> <p>Christian Lacroix </p> <p>Thomas Pink </p> <p><strong> Champagne and wines</strong> </p> <p>Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon </p> <p>Veuve Clicquot </p> <p>Chateau d'Yquem </p> <p>Krug </p> <p>Hennessy </p> <p>Cloudy Bay </p> <p><strong> Cosmetics</strong> </p> <p>Christian Dior </p> <p>Guerlain </p> <p>Givenchy </p> <p><strong> Watches</strong> </p> <p>Tag Heuer </p> <p><strong> GUCCI GROUP</strong> </p> <p>Company value: $10 billion </p> <p><strong> Fashion</strong> </p> <p>Gucci </p> <p>Yves Saint Laurent </p> <p>Sergio Rossi </p> <p>Alexander McQueen </p> <p><strong> Cosmetics</strong> </p> <p>Van Cleef &amp; Arpels </p> <p>Oscar de la Renta </p> <p>Roger &amp; Gallet </p> <p>Fendi </p> <p><strong> Jewellery</strong> </p> <p>Boucheron</p>",

But, as I say, mostly in a nice way. </p> <p>I went with Ruaridh, one of Edinburgh's emerging literary lions, who used to live in a house in the Highlands with an eagle's cage attached, and who therefore seemed ideally suited to the Gothic surroundings. On a quiet Monday, we were waited on by the boss, Dave Ramsden - a thin, shaven-headed man with a gaze that penetrated through the gloom and a voice so deep that when he spoke the cutlery on our table rattled and the building's foundations shook. If the restaurant business ever lets him down, I'm sure he could make a healthy living voicing trailers for scary American movies. </p> <p>For now, it is almost as if he is starring in one: he has a curious ability to appear at your side without you noticing - a neat trick to pull in a big room with only three occupied tables. And no sooner was he there than he was gone again, floating away into the shadows, leaving behind just the rumbling echo of that voice and the smell of sulphur. (OK, I made up the sulphur bit but the Gothic thing was all very odd - though, again, in a nice way.) </p> <p>For his starter, Ruaridh ordered the chilled mussel and king prawn velout\u00e9 with coconut milk and ginger, which struck me as a very Edinburgh thing to find on a menu. It was a dark November night, the wind outside blowing hard off the Water of Leith, but do they serve a hot soup? Not a bit of it. Hot soup is for southern nancies. In November, they serve theirs chilled. In December, it probably comes as a sorbet. I thought it a little on the underpowered side, but Ruaridh disagreed. It was, he said, a fine palate cleanser, and thick with good, fresh seafood. My steamed ballotine of rabbit confit with Savoy cabbage and haricot bean cream was the exact opposite: a solid, hearty and meaty dish. The perfect thing for a cold, early winter's night. </p> <p>My main course was a genuine original: a whole baked red mullet, split down the gut and overflowing with a pine nut and squid stuffing, as though only in the very earliest stages of a brutal disembowelling. (The mood of the place is clearly getting to me.) It was an extraordinary piece of work, the fishiness of the squid playing brilliantly against the mullet. Ruaridh's main course of a stunning fillet of beef from the (relatively) nearby Buccleugh estate was exactly the kind of thing you want to find in an Edinburgh restaurant. There were a few other things on the plate - confit potatoes, a parsley emulsion - but they all played second fiddle to the marvellous piece of beef. </p> <p>The puddings, it must be said, were not so much odd in a nice way as just plain odd. We passed on the chocolate and beetroot cake with orange sorbet and the frozen yogurt terrine with candied fennel and carrots. Instead I went for the warm egg doughnuts with vanilla citrus fruits, which read far better than it tasted. You wanted something straight out of the deep fat fryer but this seemed as if it had been hanging about on the plate a little too long. </p> <p>Ruaridh's caramelised pine nut and sultana rice pudding looked pretty in its pastry shell, but was essentially just a great rice pudding that had been tragically interfered with. We consoled ourselves with a glass each of Tich dessert wine from a winery just across the river from Sauterne. It was rich and fragrant and nicely acidic. In April, the great vampire's castle that is (Fitz)Henry moves further into Edinburgh to a site which, appropriately, was once occupied by Scottish Widows.

In any case, as long as Dave Ramsden and his voice are there to rattle the window frames the atmosphere will remain. \u0095 (Fitz)Henry, 19 Shore Place, Leith, Edinburgh (0131 555 6625). Dinner for two, including wine and service, around \u00a380. Contact Jay Rayner on jay.rayner@observer.co.uk.",

      "body": "<p>James Turrell's Skyspace stands on Cat Cairn, a promontory looking right down the 7-mile length of Kielder Water like a watchtower or blind lighthouse. The first analogy appeals to the romanticism of being just 8 miles from the Scottish border, while the second is more accurate. To get there, you must first come through the 250 square miles of the largest planted forest in Britain and then skirt along the shores of Kielder Water, which is the largest man-made lake in Europe. Given that the purpose of my trip was to look at a piece of art set in landscape, this long, increasingly impressive approach sets you into scale by expanding your cloistered, city or village horizons and then drawing them back to the turret on the crag. </p> <p>I am shamefully ignorant of this part of England, having only once paid a childhood visit to Hadrian's Wall and otherwise seen the north-east as one of those mysteries, like the Black Country or the Fens - knowing that they inspire love and passion, but having no inkling of why that is. There is no fool like an ignorant fool. Thankfully, it is never too late to learn. For a start, it is a staggeringly beautiful part of the country. And it is a breathing space away from the writhing south, which is always an advantage. </p> <p>With the trains all over the shop and only a day to get there and back, I took a 45-minute flight from Birmingham of such cramped discomfort that it felt like a joke (except that the \u00a3280 price was distinctly unfunny). But Newcastle airport is downright sexy and in minutes you are driving north-east towards the vast stretches of Kielder Forest and the Scottish border. This is Viking country, raided from north and east for 1,000 years not for possession of the soil but to spoil and dispossess. To flex the border. Even on a grey November day in the wettest autumn ever, the light is pearly rather than lowering - and when you go in search of Turrell's work, the light is everything. It is his medium. Earth and stone are used only to contain and corral light and to this end he has built 'Skyspaces' in his Arizona-desert home, as well as in Ireland, Japan, Israel, Holland, France and Northumberland. </p> <p>I first came across his work in June 1991. I was a freelancer then and received a commission to write about the gardens of the south-west corner of Ireland. We went to Skibbereen to see Creagh gardens, which I had read were 'charming'. (There's a hint of condescension in that expression: grand cannot be charming, stylish can never be charming, but small, muddly and eccentric can.) We popped into the local tourist office and it was suggested we go and see the Sky Gardens, which were just being made. So, before visiting Creagh, we went and had a fascinating few hours there. </p> <p>The estate had been bought by a wealthy Swiss art dealer who commissioned James Turrell to create an installation. When we visited, it was still at the bulldozer stage, but Turrell also happened to be visiting (he lives in Arizona) and he was, er, charming. But not in a garden way. Rather grand and impressive. Memorable. I was very taken with that Skibbereen garden because it was the first time I had seen a large outdoor space used by an artist in such a coherent, visionary way. Visionary is exactly the right word, because all Turrell's work depends upon the way that you, the viewer, sees things. As he has said about his work: '[It] is not so much about my seeing as about your seeing. There is no one between you and your experience.' That kind of remark can easily lead to the situation where it has to be pointed out to the emperor that he is wearing no clothes unless there is an experience worth seeing. But with Turrell, there always is. He walks the walk. </p> <p>The Kielder Skyspace is essentially an underground chamber approached from a round tunnel cut through the side of the hill. If you visit the excellent website (<a href=\"http://www.kielder.org\">www.kielder.org</a>) you can see from a series of photographs that the chamber and tunnel have been constructed from reinforced concrete and then piled over with rock and earth, but the effect is subterranean, a modern tumulus.</p> <p>But what is buried inside is not a bundle of bones and artefacts to guide you into the dark, but light. The ceiling of the Skyspace is a framed circle open to the sky. The light from this empty space seems to fill the eye like a pulsating, glowing object and at the same time softly illuminate the chamber. It makes the space seem contained and rich and yet is exactly the same subdued, low grey cloud cover that you flew through and drove beneath.</p> <p>The details are monumental and very precise: white walls running seamlessly into white ceiling making a circular frame round the open ring of sky; massive concrete seats painted grey linking to the grey interior of the circular entrance tunnel; and faultlessly crisp edges to the circles of sky and black gravel directly beneath the open roof. Sound bounces round the walls. The effect is mesmerising, quietly transfixing. At dawn or dusk your entrance into the Skyspace triggers lights around the circular space hidden behind the seats, creating a ring of ambient light and the white walls glow ochre to enrich the sky colour. </p> <p>The experience of sitting quietly (albeit freezing) is enormously satisfying and enriching, even though sensation is stripped down and pared back as far as it will go without being diminished. All superfluities are abandoned. I would love this in my garden. A building like this, subterranean or overtly external, is within the tradition of temples in the landscape such as you find at Stowe or Stourhead. To find this type of building - in itself lifted from temples and bowers of medieval, Roman, Greek and Byzantine civilisations, interpreted in this modern idiom - is tremendously exciting, especially in the rather philistine world of conventional garden buildings.</p> <p>Don't get me wrong: I am sure that Turrell would be amused to think of this piece of art compared to a summerhouse or merely a decorative stop in a highly manufactured landscape, but the analogy is nevertheless there. Gardens are our private, domestic landscape. Although seemingly a vast expanse of wilderness, Kielder Forest is in many ways as artificial and contrived as any garden. It is not an unpopulated space that is needed for this work so much as unpolluted light, free of the insidious ambient glow of street lamps and car headlights. </p> <p>Any carefully thought out garden building, whether it uses light as skillfully as Turrell does or is simply contrived to provide calm seclusion, adds a vital element to the garden as a whole. This obviously happens on an external level, although I would prefer it if the whole thing were completely submerged beneath its hillock of earth and rock, rather than cladding it in drystone and burying only the bottom half. But perhaps in a massive public space like Kielder the sight of the tower is needed as a signpost to announce itself. </p> <p>But what really matters is what happens on an internal level. The building and contemplative manipulation of light and space strongly influences how you see the world and in particular how you use light and space at home, indoors and out. </p> <p>Buildings in the garden world, both domestic and public, are on the whole embarrassingly badly designed, retrospective and unambitious. But the Skyspace and the other buildings at Kielder are ambitious, modern grown-up works of art that can compete with anything else in the world. No doubt planning permission and the cost (the Skyspace cost \u00a3300,000) would constrain all but the grandest gardeners, but I will be thinking very carefully how to include the lessons of Kielder into my own backyard and I urge you to make the journey there to do the same.</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>I had some chillies in the tunnel hanging on all autumn, not growing or ripening but not dying either. Nevertheless I pulled them all up this week and the space has been given over instead to parsley that I had been growing in pots. For years, I had laboured under the delusion that parsley needs damp shade to thrive. It doesn't. It will tolerate some damp, but too much will rot its roots. In fact, I have even put cloches over the parsley growing outside to try and keep it drier. </p> <p>The leaves this year clung on for dear life, but finally fell. The big hazel outside the back door is the real arbiter of season and its nakedness can only spell winter. But the most beautiful leaves this sodden autumn were those of a rose, Rosa wilmottiae . This has a shimmer of tiny leaves the colour of beaten gold that lasted for weeks, carried on plum red stems with weird and beautiful thorns bunched all together. In summer, it has small, fairly modest lilac-pink flowers. It is one of a batch of assorted roses that I planted a few years ago and which I love. They include R hugonis , R cantabridgiensis , R moyesii , R wintonensis , R sericea pteracantha, R moschata and R complicata . They are all tough and loose, and pretty unsuitable for a small garden. They prune with a pair of shears and their laxity and sprawling nature encourages a general freeing of the garden spirit. Long may they sprawl.</p> <p>I have had an injured shoulder for months now which has severely limited my horticultural activities and last week I added to my infirmities by dropping a paving slab on my foot. We were shifting stone that was laid this summer in the Jewel garden for a patch indoors, reasoning that it was less work to redo the work outside than to go and find a new source of slabs that will match. Anyway, this very handsome square of York stone landed on my instep which made it swell dramatically, turn black and reduced me to a hobble for a few days. Entirely my fault. Of course, a psychoanalyst would say that these things are never accidental and that what I really wanted was an excuse not to garden. And with the rain tattooing the windows, the sodden ground either submerged or slicked with mud, the light almost gone by 3pm while I lie with my foot up on the sofa watching the rugby on television, I can believe that, subconscious or not, there might be a grain of truth in that.</p>",

That near-death experience has brought about a huge change in Best, who has pledged to raise awareness about a disease which he warns can damage anyone in society 'whether you're a down-and-out or a genius'. </p> <p>'I guarantee you there's no one who doesn't know someone who has had a problem, either directly or indirectly, through alcohol. Unfortunately it's there. It's easily available. It's a serious, serious problem,' Best said. 'It's a terrible illness, not only for people who drink too much, as I obviously did, but also for young kids who suffer from failure of the liver.' </p> <p>The 54-year-old ex-Manchester United star, who is now teetotal, will join forces with Professor Roger Williams, the doctor who nursed him back to health after he collapsed last March, in a bid to raise \u00a3150,000 to fund a three-year study into alcohol's impact on the liver. The money will pay for research at the Institute of Hepatology at University College Hospital in London run by Williams, a leading liver specialist. </p> <p>Where Best once made light of his condition, now he wants to warn about the dangers of 'a terrible illness' and help other problem drinkers. He began drinking heavily when he retired in 1974 in a vain bid to replace the 'buzz' he got from playing. Perhaps his most embarrassing alcohol-related moment came in 1990 when BBC chatshow host Terry Wogan cut short a live interview with a visibly drunk Best who was slurring and swearing. </p> <p>Williams said Best's decision to speak out could radically change attitudes towards alcoholism and fund work which could lead to improvements in patients suffering liver failure. </p> <p>'There hasn't been much research done into liver disease because of the stigma of alcoholism and it has been hard to raise funds,' said Williams. 'But I hope that with George being so open about his condition, that will help to put a better perspective on an illness that needs better treatment. It's a great tribute to George that he's doing this.' </p> <p>Best and Williams plan to speak at a series of fundraising dinners. The first is likely to be next spring at Old Trafford, where Best used to play. A United spokesman said: 'The club has received a request to help with the initiative and is happy to consider ways of supporting the appeal. Anything that George is involved with is important to us too, because he remains a legend among our supporters.' </p> <p>Best says that when he was rushed to London's Cromwell Hospital last March, yellow with jaundice, his liver was 'just about gone. It's still not right. I was pretty bad. I was lucky. I got involved with a wonderful man, Roger Williams. He basically told me that if I had another drink, that was it'. Best admits he could easily have died then. 'Every day is a bonus [now]', he says. </p> <p>The star, who now divides his time between working for Sky TV and living quietly in his native Northern Ireland, is glad alcoholism 'has been recognised by the medical profession as an illness. Not so long ago, if you said alcohol, you were treated a little bit like a leper. They thought someone who drank too much was a drunk. But that's not the way it is. It doesn't have any bounds, alcohol. It doesn't matter whether you're a down-and-out or a genius.' </p> <p>Dr Domhnall MacAuley, editor of the British Journal of Sports Medicine , said: 'George's decision to talk about his condition could challenge the pub mentality of British football and help young players who want to stay away from alcohol to do so. </p> <p>'My only fear is that he may fall off the wagon, as he did before. That would be a heavy blow to this excellent initiative. You never beat alcoholism. You control it one day at a time.' </p> <p>Best admits he has had 'one slip' since March - two glasses of champagne which made him feel 'really ill' - but says new drugs have helped to eliminate his craving for drink.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:denis.campbell@observer.co.uk\">denis.campbell@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

'Hardly anyone talks about \"alleviation\" any more because it is not conceptually right. It is kind of softening the impact of poverty and not getting rid of it.' Sharpen up, Will Hutton!</p> <p>She wants to get on with shaping the current world system to halve the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, to ensure that every child goes to primary school and that the mother of every baby has proper health care - and all by 2015. She is impressed by the way the Asian Tigers have managed to use access to world markets, investment in education, controlled capitalism and energetic government to lever themselves towards Western living standards in less than a generation. The task now, she believes, is to ensure that the countries of South Asia and Africa repeat the Tigers' lead.</p> <p>Her mission is to save development from those who think it is 'pictures of African children with flies on their faces that moves their heart, they put some money in the charity box and feel depressed.' Instead, she wants to offer a programme 'that is practical and achievable; that removes the cause of their suffering'. This, she hopes, will generate demands for action and a transformation of how we think about the world's poor.</p> <p>Clare Short in full sail has always been formidable, whether she is decrying page three girls or the illiberalism of the Prevention of Terrorism Acts.</p> <p>Now her commitment to capitalism in the service of poverty elimination has made her the scourge of anti-free trade protesters and environmentalists alike. The Secretary of State is trying to bring Third Way politics into an area where it seems least likely to succeed and, at the same time, to make it understandable and controversial.</p> <p>For, as street protests at the European Summit in Nice this weekend follow those at the IMF and World Bank annual general meeting in Prague in September and, famously, in Seattle at the abortive World Trade Organisation meeting, globalisation has not got many popular champions.</p> <p>The onward march of transnational corporations and world money markets dismantles icons such as national community and democracy, has enfeebled governments and provoked universal disquiet. From British euro-scepticism, to Islamic fundamentalism or the re-emergence of the Austrian far right - all have similar roots in locally grounded disquiet that what really matters to people no longer has legitimacy. Clare Short is taking on this movement head to head. She believes this reaction is wrong-headed, hypocritical and selfish.</p> <p>What the poor want, she says, and what she wants for them, is a chance to enjoy Western living standards by joining in the same capitalism that delivers the goods for us.</p> <p>Her main concern is Africa: conflict- ridden, devastated by Aids and home to the majority of the world's extreme poor. She sees the success of Mozambique and Uganda in winning inward investment and sustaining Asian Tiger-type economic growth rates that allows them to keep ahead of population growth - albeit from a desperately low base - as a model for the rest of the continent.</p> <p>But although she praises free trade and private inward investment, Short still carries 'the white woman's burden' - the belief that the rich countries must take responsibility. A Western country like Britain has to get stuck in and help, especially in providing health and education and also to stop corrupt governments, she believes. Good governments must uphold rigorous standards in both the private and public sectors - and above all in their 'unreliable' African banks which ship out of Africa proportionally 10 times more savings than happens in Asia.</p> <p>One of Short's intended plans is to help governments recover money illicitly salted away in London by their predecessors.</p> <p>The big story, though, is to embrace the market. She talks enthusiastically about how Africa must develop by using its abundant land to grow agricultural goods for world markets with higher added-value - from coffee to flowers - and process the products in Africa.</p> <p>I put it to her that this is diametrically opposed to the arguments from green campaigners like Vandana Shiva who has her own farm in South India where she grows organic food using traditional methods in order to maximise local employment - and who is sharply critical of Short's approach because it creates inequality and environmental depredation.</p> <p>Short returns the fire: 'I would like to go to her house. I'll bet she's got things that come from all over the world. If you want to lock Africa and the poorest of South Asia out of that world, you're locking them into marginalisation and growing poverty. It is intolerable.'</p> <p>She has the same contempt for the anti-trade protesters. 'I don't see how burning down McDonald's helps anyone anywhere in the world. I think it is self-indulgent. Actually breaking up the World Trade Organisation would put us backwards. We would then have big rich governments and companies setting the rules for trade. Small and poor countries wouldn't have any say in it.'</p> <p>Nor should the rules-based trading system she defends have a rule against the use of child labour; it is only a reflection of extreme poverty and if we stop it we only condemn children to worse - beggary and prostitution.</p> <p>'The Americans argued in Seattle that there should be a rule in the WTO that says any country that has child labour has barriers against its trade. But that would punish every single poor country in the world,' she says.</p> <p>Her free trade instincts do not extend to free financial markets, which she thinks can be a menace. She favours the Tobin tax, taxing foreign exchange speculation, but only if it can be made to be practical and thinks that countries have to be careful how to decontrol their banks and foreign exchange markets. Governments may have to step in to stop capital stampeding out of a country in panic with capital controls.</p> <p>Short is right about the World Trade Organisation, right about the potential benefits from globalisation and right about the priorities for Third World governments. Her difficulty is that capitalism isn't fair, and that the development she advocates will necessarily throw up vicious inequalities with scant means of closing them.</p> <p>She is a staunch advocate of increasing the aid budget towards the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GDP, and of allowing the recipients to spend it as they choose.</p> <p>She says: 'As long as I am around it has to go up year on year', a veiled threat to Gordon Brown and Tony Blair that if they don't see her right she'll be on the back benches. Her progressive and considered White Paper is probably the best we can hope for in the circumstances.</p> <p>The question is whether we should be aiming to change the circumstances.</p>",

She has the same contempt for the anti-trade protesters. 'I don't see how burning down McDonald's helps anyone anywhere in the world. I think it is self-indulgent. Actually breaking up the World Trade Organisation would put us backwards. We would then have big rich governments and companies setting the rules for trade. Small and poor countries wouldn't have any say in it.' Nor should the rules-based trading system she defends have a rule against the use of child labour; it is only a reflection of extreme poverty and if we stop it we only condemn children to worse - beggary and prostitution. 'The Americans argued in Seattle that there should be a rule in the WTO that says any country that has child labour has barriers against its trade. But that would punish every single poor country in the world,' she says. Her free trade instincts do not extend to free financial markets, which she thinks can be a menace. She favours the Tobin tax, taxing foreign exchange speculation, but only if it can be made to be practical and thinks that countries have to be careful how to decontrol their banks and foreign exchange markets. Governments may have to step in to stop capital stampeding out of a country in panic with capital controls. Short is right about the World Trade Organisation, right about the potential benefits from globalisation and right about the priorities for Third World governments. Her difficulty is that capitalism isn't fair, and that the development she advocates will necessarily throw up vicious inequalities with scant means of closing them. She is a staunch advocate of increasing the aid budget towards the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GDP, and of allowing the recipients to spend it as they choose. She says: 'As long as I am around it has to go up year on year', a veiled threat to Gordon Brown and Tony Blair that if they don't see her right she'll be on the back benches. Her progressive and considered White Paper is probably the best we can hope for in the circumstances. The question is whether we should be aiming to change the circumstances.",

No queues. </p> <p>But what if the e-tailer fails to deliver your carefully selected pressies in time for Christmas? </p> <p>Tim Gordon, a partner at Ernst &amp; Young, says that many big companies would rather refuse an order than disappoint on delivery. But smaller, recently established firms may still come a cropper this Christmas, he warns. </p> <p>New 'distance shopping' regulations introduced in October give shoppers the right to clear information on arrangements for delivery before they commit to buy ing - including how long it will take for the goods to arrive. Catherine Hinchcliffe at the Office of Fair Trading says: 'Arrangements are normally for delivery within 30 days, but if the retailer specifies a shorter time frame, it should stick to it.' </p> <p>You are entitled to your money back if an e-tailer promises delivery within four days and fails to make the delivery. However, getting your money back after the event won't prevent tears on Christmas Day, so it's a good idea to check e-tailers' last shipping dates to ensure delivery by December 24. Print a copy of the terms shown on the website. Richard Webb, a spokesman for the Trading Standards Institute, says: 'If you have doubts, ring the company up and ask specifically about delivery dates - and keep a note of who you speak to and what they say.' </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.etoys.co.uk\">Etoys.co.uk</a> says its last shopping date for standard delivery is midnight on 17 December, while those prepared to fork out the extra for express delivery can extend the deadline to noon on 19 December. A spokeswoman for the company says there is no danger of paid-for goods not being available at the last minute: 'We work on real-time inventory, which means you can only order if the goods are physically in the warehouse.' </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk\">Amazon.co.uk</a> does sell goods which are still held by suppliers, but promises that any items carrying a small Christmas tree symbol in their details on the website will be delivered by Christmas Eve. Its last order days are 14 December for Europe, 21 December for the UK. </p> <p>If it looks as though your internet goods are not going to turn up in time and you decide to buy an alternative, remember that even if your purchase does turn up on time you can return it within seven working days. </p> <p>If your purchase doesn't arrive, complain to the company first. Make your complaint in writing, keep a copy and send the original letter by recorded delivery. If the company does not respond or refuses to refund your money, contact your local citizens' advice bureau or trad ing standards officer, who will be able to advise you on the best way to get your money back. This may involve making a claim through the small claims court - leaflets and application forms are available from local county courts. </p> <p>If you spent more than \u00a3100 on your purchase using a credit card, you can throw the ball into the credit card company's court by demanding a refund and leaving it to chase recompense from the internet company.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shopping on the internet can be great when it works smoothly. No struggling round the shops with heavy bags. No queues. But what if the e-tailer fails to deliver your carefully selected pressies in time for Christmas? Tim Gordon, a partner at Ernst &amp; Young, says that many big companies would rather refuse an order than disappoint on delivery. But smaller, recently established firms may still come a cropper this Christmas, he warns. New 'distance shopping' regulations introduced in October give shoppers the right to clear information on arrangements for delivery before they commit to buy ing - including how long it will take for the goods to arrive. Catherine Hinchcliffe at the Office of Fair Trading says: 'Arrangements are normally for delivery within 30 days, but if the retailer specifies a shorter time frame, it should stick to it.' You are entitled to your money back if an e-tailer promises delivery within four days and fails to make the delivery. However, getting your money back after the event won't prevent tears on Christmas Day, so it's a good idea to check e-tailers' last shipping dates to ensure delivery by December 24. Print a copy of the terms shown on the website. Richard Webb, a spokesman for the Trading Standards Institute, says: 'If you have doubts, ring the company up and ask specifically about delivery dates - and keep a note of who you speak to and what they say.' Etoys.co.uk says its last shopping date for standard delivery is midnight on 17 December, while those prepared to fork out the extra for express delivery can extend the deadline to noon on 19 December. A spokeswoman for the company says there is no danger of paid-for goods not being available at the last minute: 'We work on real-time inventory, which means you can only order if the goods are physically in the warehouse.' Amazon.co.uk does sell goods which are still held by suppliers, but promises that any items carrying a small Christmas tree symbol in their details on the website will be delivered by Christmas Eve. Its last order days are 14 December for Europe, 21 December for the UK. If it looks as though your internet goods are not going to turn up in time and you decide to buy an alternative, remember that even if your purchase does turn up on time you can return it within seven working days. If your purchase doesn't arrive, complain to the company first. Make your complaint in writing, keep a copy and send the original letter by recorded delivery. If the company does not respond or refuses to refund your money, contact your local citizens' advice bureau or trad ing standards officer, who will be able to advise you on the best way to get your money back. This may involve making a claim through the small claims court - leaflets and application forms are available from local county courts. If you spent more than \u00a3100 on your purchase using a credit card, you can throw the ball into the credit card company's court by demanding a refund and leaving it to chase recompense from the internet company.",

      "body": "<p>One of the largest payouts Unison achieved for its members last year was \u00a3600,000 awarded to Alison Hockaday. But getting it - as compensation for injuries at work which resulted in her right leg being amputated below the knee had taken a 13-year legal battle. </p> <p>Her horrific injuries, and the even more horrific consequences, were not the result of being mangled in some heavy industrial machinery but of slipping over. First she slid on wet leaves on the entrance steps to the hospital where she worked as an occupational therapy assistant, and twisted her knee. More than three years later, her injury was exacerbated when she slipped on a wet vinyl floor in the hospital and fractured her right ankle. </p> <p>This extreme case is one of the huge number of injuries in the workplace suffered by employees in theoretically safe white-collar jobs. In the parlance of the health and safety professionals, 'slips, trips and falls' are the single largest cause of major injuries at work. In 1998-99, more than 34,500 non-fatal injuries caused by a slip, trip or fall on the same level were reported to the enforcing authorities. The Health &amp; Safety Executive estimates that the cost to employers every year is more than \u00a3300 million and the overall cost to society is put at between \u00a3810m and \u00a3840m a year. </p> <p>The HSE figures show that thousands of working days are lost every year because of accidents in the office. For instance, more than 2,000 injuries involving at least three lost working days in offices were reported to the enforcing authorities during 1997-98 alone. </p> <p>Trailing wires across walkways, or the boxes of stationery left next to the photocopier that catch unawares anyone hurrying past, may seem a minor irritation, but these kinds of hazards can cause terrible accidents. </p> <p>Westminster City Council in London has frequently seen the effects. The council's patch includes a very broad range of offices - from flagship headquarters to very small offices packed into multi-occupancy buildings. For the year to the end of last March, health and safety officers received 630 accident reports from employees, of which an estimated third were in the office sector. </p> <p>David Wildey, a senior health and safety officer with the council, said: 'People forget, when they look at the statistics for the large numbers of slips, trips and falls that happen each year, just how serious they can be. For instance, we had a situation of a lady in her mid-fifties who tripped over a box in a gangway, fell awkwardly and struck the corner of a filing cabinet with her face, damaging her cheekbone and the corner of her eye socket. She never returned to work. </p> <p>'In another incident, a word processor operator, also in her early fifties, caught her foot in the cabling to her workstation, fell awkwardly and shattered her arm in three places. She also was never able to return to work.' </p> <p>But the cases seen by health and safety officers in local authorities may be the tip of the iceberg. Although employers are required by law to report a wide range of accidents at work to the authorities (a free HSE leaflet gives details of incidents which are reportable), not all of them do. </p> <p>In fact there are wide-ranging legal requirements on employers relating to health and safety that are not always followed. The British Safety Council, in its free booklet 'Health and Safety in the Office', says: 'Unlike very specific sets of legislation which cover the safe use of chemicals and workplace machinery, there is no single set of regulations covering health and safety in the office. However, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 require employers to assess general health and safety risks in office environments, including the dangers posed by slips and trips, using chemicals and carrying out manual handling tasks.' </p> <p>But are employers actually assessing risk? According to a study of the regulations that specifically refer to the safe use of computer equipment at work (the DSE Regulations), carried out for the HSE by the Institute of Occupational Medicine in 1997, only 39 per cent of organisations questioned had undertaken risk assessments of computer workstations. </p> <p>The study also found that a third of employers, particularly those running small firms, were unaware of the regulations. Through the experience of its members, Unison is only too aware of this level of ignorance, in some cases wilful. 'What we campaign vigorously on is for employers to carry out proper risk assessment in the workplace,' said Unison spokesperson Anne Mitchell. 'It is their duty to look for potential problem areas. But what tends to happen is by the time it gets to that stage it is too late.' </p> <p>'We hear it all the time: it's only after someone has had an accident that something is done about a potential hazard that has been there for ages. We recently won a payout of \u00a35,200 for an office worker who had a filing cabinet fall on him, injuring his foot and hip. And in another recent case a woman was paid \u00a335,000 after injuring her back after being asked to lift items that were too heavy for her.' In total, Unison won \u00a338m in compensation for its members for personal injuries. 'People may look at this figure and the amount of individual payouts and say that is an awful lot of money,' added Mitchell. But in every case the injured party says that they would much rather have their health back than any amount of money.' </p> <p>Apart from the dangers of trips and slips, there are other accidents waiting to happen in an office. The British Safety Council points out that while offices are normally thought to be much quieter than factories, the continuing ringing of phones and faxes, along with the noise of people talking and typing, can sometimes cause stress and increase the chances of accidents. </p> <p>There are also hazardous chemicals about - in the form of toners for photocopiers, as well as basic cleaning products. Therefore, under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations 1999, employers are required to assess the risk of exposure to chemicals. </p> <p>If an accident does occur at work, get in touch with the company first-aider or appointed person. For offices with fewer than 50 employees there may only be an untrained appointed person. In companies with more than 50 employees, the law states that there should be at least one trained first-aider able to deal with an emergency. </p> <p>To reduce the chances of an accident happening in your office in the first place, the British Safety Council advises: 'Just taking the time to look around an office and noting things as simple as stray electrical cables or open filing cabinets can stop an accident taking place.' </p> <p>Where there are problems that an employer refuses to deal with, many hundreds of employees each year complain to the health and safety officers of their local authority, often anonymously. 'In these cases,' said Westminster City Council's David Wildey, 'maintaining the anonymity of the reporter is paramount. We would usually visit the premises under the guise of a \"planned\" inspection. We have to be particularly careful where it is a small employer, that the complainant isn't too obvious.' </p> <p> Health &amp; Safety Executive information line: 08701 545500.

There are also hazardous chemicals about - in the form of toners for photocopiers, as well as basic cleaning products. Therefore, under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations 1999, employers are required to assess the risk of exposure to chemicals. If an accident does occur at work, get in touch with the company first-aider or appointed person. For offices with fewer than 50 employees there may only be an untrained appointed person. In companies with more than 50 employees, the law states that there should be at least one trained first-aider able to deal with an emergency. To reduce the chances of an accident happening in your office in the first place, the British Safety Council advises: 'Just taking the time to look around an office and noting things as simple as stray electrical cables or open filing cabinets can stop an accident taking place.' Where there are problems that an employer refuses to deal with, many hundreds of employees each year complain to the health and safety officers of their local authority, often anonymously. 'In these cases,' said Westminster City Council's David Wildey, 'maintaining the anonymity of the reporter is paramount. We would usually visit the premises under the guise of a \"planned\" inspection. We have to be particularly careful where it is a small employer, that the complainant isn't too obvious.'

(Too often the task is given to the manager's PA, who hasn't the power to make sure things are done.) \u0095 Is there proper consultation on health and safety with employees? \u0095 Does the employer regularly inspect the workplace? \u0095 Are there regular safety drills and clearly marked exits? \u0095 Check that employer has carried out a thorough risk assessment of the workplace. \u0095 Are gangways kept clear? \u0095 Is there adequate working space? \u0095 Is the lighting adequate and suitable for the task? \u0095 Is ventilation adequate? \u0095 Does the employer have a smoking policy?
