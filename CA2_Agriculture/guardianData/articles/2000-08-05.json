      "body": "<p> The first game my dad ever took me to was City v Newcastle United at Maine Road in 1971. That was it; City became my team.</p> <p> United were in the Second Division then and we were the top team in Manchester for about 10 years. But over the years, when City have been struggling and United have become the best team in Europe, I've sometimes wondered why my dad brought me to Maine Road rather than Old Trafford. </p> <p>The reason is basically a family one - my dad hated his brothers. They were all Irish people who came over here and decided to support United. My dad chose City instead, just to piss them off. No other reason than that. Liam and I should by rights have been United fans. </p> <p> My dad used to take us into the Kippax Stand and sit us up on this narrow brick wall at the back, where we'd lean against this big sheet of corrugated asbestos, and then he'd piss off to the bar with all the other dads.</p> <p> I remember in that first game we absolutely murdered Newcastle 5-1. But the only goal I saw ( because if City got anywhere over the halfway line it got a bit chaotic and we were too small to see over the crowd) was Malcolm Macdonald's. </p> <p> The Kippax was basically a big shed. It was very dark - there was no lighting and a really huge roof coming down low, so it was like looking at a television screen.</p> <p> In the Seventies everyone used to wear scarves and have Rod Stewart haircuts. You could still drink in grounds so there was always fighting especially if away supporters (who were mixed in among City fans because there was no segregation then) celebrated a goal.</p> <p> Nowadays in football grounds fans tend not to sing a lot. But in the Seventies it was deafening in the Kippax. It was like the sound coming out of a speaker. We sang 'Lily The Pink', one about Colin Bell called 'Colin The King' and all the naive old ones like 'Tommy Booth Walks on Water'.It was only in the Eighties that songs began getting witty and complicated and having swearing in them.</p> <p> When we were at primary school my dad took us mainly to night games, because on a Saturday he'd be in the bookies betting on the horses, as Irish fellas do.</p> <p> Wednesday night games were even better than Saturday afternoon games. The pitch seemed greener and it was usually an exciting game like an FA Cup match. We began going regularly on Saturday afternoons when we went to secondary school and met other City fans, and my mum could trust us to go out on our own. I went religiously every other Saturday between the ages of 12 and 21.</p> <p> The first season we were in the Second Division, after we lost to Luton, we went to every single game, home and away. We'd just left school and signed on and there was fuck all else to do. We used to get train 'specials' - it was \u00a32 to anywhere in the country on Saturday afternoons - to places like Oxford, Barnsley and Ipswich, which took about six months to get to and from. </p> <p> Players in the Seventies were guys who went to the pub before the game, smoked cigarettes and liked to bet on the horses, whereas players now are just programmed robots. You see Alan Shearer and just think 'you're the most boring person in the world'. We used to watch people like Stan Bowles and Rodney Marsh - real characters - and Colin Bell, Franny Lee and Mike Summerbee.</p> <p> The late Seventies, early Eighties team, with people like Peter Barnes, was really good. But the best City player I've ever seen was Georgi Kinkladze. A mate of mine who worked at Maine Road rang me up when we signed him and said: \"I've just been to watch him; he's playing a different sport.\" I said: \"Heard it all before, mate.\" But he was right. We went to Kinky's first game and came away thinking \"well, we're either going to go and win the European Cup now or we'll be in the Fourth Division in five years\" - which we nearly were.</p> <p> You see, all City fans are arsed about is the pitch looking good on a Saturday and turning up to see the one player who's better than anyone at Man Utd. For three or four years, it didn't matter that we weren't in the same league or that United were winning everything and qualifying for Europe because we had the best player in Manchester, bar Roy Keane. Kinky was amazing. It was widely accepted that we had the best player in the country. Plus he looked good in the kit. In the end he had to go because he was frustrated. Why did he score all those great goals, where he took on eight players? Because he had no City player to pass to. They were all shit. What, Peter Beagrie? We've had quite a few bad players: Steve Daley would admit himself he was never worth a million pounds. But that was Malcolm Allison's school of buying players. How much do you want for him? Five hundred thousand. Well I'll give you a million.</p> <p> Clive Allen and Niall Quinn were both good, even though everyone said they were past it. We've had some good managers, like Peter Reid - we even finished above United one season under him, which is unheard of - and Billy McNeill, who got us promotion the first time we went down. Every time a new manager arrives, I always say: \"He's going to be the one, the one to help us win a bit of meaningful silverware\", but they never are so I'm not going to say that about Joe Royle.</p> <p> City fans have this thing that as long as you look good in the kit or sat in the dugout, then it doesn't matter what you're like. Howard Kendall didn't look cool and neither did Brian Horton, whereas Malcolm Allison did. He turned up at Monday morning training in a white Rolls-Royce with a bottle of champagne and some actress in the back of the car. That's football management. </p> <p> The thing that fucks me off about players now is that they come off the pitch and say \"well, we worked hard\". Did you? Bricklayers work hard and they don't get paid 50 grand a week. It's no wonder that all these kids go round smashing up town centres when all the England players go on about is getting stuck in, standing your ground, working hard and being aggressive. Whereas the French players like ballet, man! Their supporters cause no trouble because the idols they look up to are artists. Not fucking \"get stuck in lads, they don't like it up 'em, foreigners.\" Fuck off. They're playing a different sport. </p> <p>David Beckham is the best player England have got by a country mile. It's quite amazing what he can do with a football. I do feel sorry for him, but it comes with the territory. He's a great player. Beckham and Scholes are all England have got. </p> <p>George Best was dead right when he said recently United were better than England. Roy Keane, Jaap Stam and Ryan Giggs would walk into the England team; even Denis Irwin might. I say all that as a City fan.</p> <p> In the Eighties I used to hate Man Utd with a passion. But as you get older, you mellow. I hated Mark Hughes and Eric Cantona, but Paul Scholes? He's like Ashley off Coronation Street. </p> <p> It's great that City are back in the Premiership. There's lots of games in London so I'll go a lot, plus it'll be the first time the end of an Oasis world tour has coincided with the start, rather than the end, of a season. And I can't wait for the derbies; they're pure, unadulterated hatred, like when Celtic play Rangers. </p> <p> We'll be top of the league some time in the first six weeks, for a week; I'll put 50 grand on that now with anybody. There'll be City fans on TV saying \"it's the European Cup for us now, cock\". Piss off. The middle 15-20 games will take care of themselves. It's the last six games that will decide if we stay up. We have to play four of the top six: United, Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea. Relegation is going to be between eight teams again, and we have to beat those other seven twice to stand a chance. We could get into Europe this season or get relegated without scoring a goal. That's why I support City. </p> <p>\u0095 Oasis headline the Reading and Leeds festivals (25 and 28 August, ticket details: 020-8963 0940) and also play the Glasgow Green Festival on 26 August.

      "body": "<p>Most patients notice the carpets and bright, cheerful surroundings. They also appreciate getting a cup of tea while they wait. But, apart from a discreet logo by the door, there is little else to tell anyone arriving for an appointment at the magnetic resonance imaging scanning unit at North Hampshire NHS Trust in Basingstoke that the department has in effect been outsourced to the private sector, as part of the Private Finance Initiative (PFI). </p> <p>'The political boundary [between public and private] - it's already been crossed,' says Patrick Byrne, managing director of Lodestone Patient Care, the company which built and runs North Hants and six other scanning units for the NHS. </p> <p>Byrne believes the meshing of public and private in the delivery of healthcare, as suggested in the recent paper by the Institute for Public Policy, is natural and inevitable - and not just in the UK. While many other countries have overtaken the UK in quality of healthcare, none has cracked the financial problems of providing it - and everyone is watching the UK's initiatives like a hawk, according to Byrne. </p> <p>The IPP paper, launched by Health Minister John Denham, argues that the emphasis on using the PFI only for huge hospital building projects and facilities management - excluding clinical services from contracts - is inflexible and unimaginative, ignoring the scope for smaller-scale, more direct ways of improving healthcare. It might have been thinking of Lodestone, a trail-blazing example of how such partnerships could work. </p> <p>The business came about by accident when Byrne, then in investment banking in the City, was approached by his brother, a consultant neuro-radiologist, to help with raising funding for a much-needed MRI scanner at the Atkinson Morley Hospital in Wimbledon. Having raised the money, Byrne discovered there were management and manpower issues involved in actually operating the scanner. He ended up running it. </p> <p>It was when he was approached to do the same thing by a second hospital that Lodestone was born as a real business. 'Yes, we have to make a profit to be able to raise the money in the first place,' says Byrne. But he insists that the company's starting point for a project is not profit itself but whether it can add value in patient care: 'Is it a situation where we can provide a better service to patients more cost-effectively than the NHS can do itself?' </p> <p>His brother, the catalyst for the enterprise and now a consultant in Oxford, remains the company's medical direc tor. Their formula seems to work. Lodestone's seven units will scan around 26,000 patients this year, a 40 per cent increase over 1999, generating turnover of more than \u00a34 million. In a patient survey, it scored 98 per cent on patient satisfaction ratings for staff attitudes, quality of treatment and attractive environment. Although it's hard to prove, Byrne believes Lodestone is capable of improving medical outcomes, too. Put simply, it has an incentive to do so. </p> <p>It can afford to upgrade as and when technological advances are made to the hardware. It also gains from the learning curve of running it intensively.

      "bodyText": "Most patients notice the carpets and bright, cheerful surroundings. They also appreciate getting a cup of tea while they wait. But, apart from a discreet logo by the door, there is little else to tell anyone arriving for an appointment at the magnetic resonance imaging scanning unit at North Hampshire NHS Trust in Basingstoke that the department has in effect been outsourced to the private sector, as part of the Private Finance Initiative (PFI). 'The political boundary [between public and private] - it's already been crossed,' says Patrick Byrne, managing director of Lodestone Patient Care, the company which built and runs North Hants and six other scanning units for the NHS. Byrne believes the meshing of public and private in the delivery of healthcare, as suggested in the recent paper by the Institute for Public Policy, is natural and inevitable - and not just in the UK. While many other countries have overtaken the UK in quality of healthcare, none has cracked the financial problems of providing it - and everyone is watching the UK's initiatives like a hawk, according to Byrne. The IPP paper, launched by Health Minister John Denham, argues that the emphasis on using the PFI only for huge hospital building projects and facilities management - excluding clinical services from contracts - is inflexible and unimaginative, ignoring the scope for smaller-scale, more direct ways of improving healthcare. It might have been thinking of Lodestone, a trail-blazing example of how such partnerships could work. The business came about by accident when Byrne, then in investment banking in the City, was approached by his brother, a consultant neuro-radiologist, to help with raising funding for a much-needed MRI scanner at the Atkinson Morley Hospital in Wimbledon. Having raised the money, Byrne discovered there were management and manpower issues involved in actually operating the scanner. He ended up running it. It was when he was approached to do the same thing by a second hospital that Lodestone was born as a real business. 'Yes, we have to make a profit to be able to raise the money in the first place,' says Byrne. But he insists that the company's starting point for a project is not profit itself but whether it can add value in patient care: 'Is it a situation where we can provide a better service to patients more cost-effectively than the NHS can do itself?' His brother, the catalyst for the enterprise and now a consultant in Oxford, remains the company's medical direc tor. Their formula seems to work. Lodestone's seven units will scan around 26,000 patients this year, a 40 per cent increase over 1999, generating turnover of more than \u00a34 million. In a patient survey, it scored 98 per cent on patient satisfaction ratings for staff attitudes, quality of treatment and attractive environment. Although it's hard to prove, Byrne believes Lodestone is capable of improving medical outcomes, too. Put simply, it has an incentive to do so. It can afford to upgrade as and when technological advances are made to the hardware. It also gains from the learning curve of running it intensively. The sophistication of the kit takes nothing away from the skill of the radiographers, a mixture of Lodestone employees and NHS staff on secondment. The reverse, in fact: advanced equipment demands and justifies advanced skills to use it. Critically, the company has found enormous benefits in having consultant radiologists present during scans, rather than just diagnosing them afterwards. Ideally, Byrne would like to employ consultants directly, rather than just buying their time, although this raises tricky issues of politics and pay. 'NHS consultants are grossly underpaid and very inefficiently used,' he says. 'Most say that if they were properly paid they'd give up private practice tomorrow.' It would be ironic if it took employment by a private company to bring this about. On the strength of an eight-year track record of health management in partnership with the NHS, Lodestone reckons it is ready for the challenge of moving into new fields. A PFI tender is coming up for an entire hospital diagnostic department, with MRI, computerised tomography and ultrasound scanning as well as X-ray and screening. Other trusts are watching with interest. Fixed or 'ambu-latory' outpatient departments are other outsourcing candidates. A diagnostic de-partment would cost up to \u00a310 million, five times more than an MRI unit, an 'ambulatory unit' double that. 'There would be no difficulty raising the money,' promises Byrne. The company's larger ambition is to move into oncology - management and treatment of cancer. Cancer treatment, where the UK again falls down in comparison with Europe, is fast becoming an NHS priority.

Scholl provided the first real danger for Barthez in only the second minute of the game when he slammed his volley narrowly wide of the post with the French World Cup-winning keeper beaten. United responded with Beckham sending his looping free-kick from out on the left flank to the far post, but Roy Keane's side-footed volley back across goal failed to find a team-mate. There were more worries for the Premiership champions when a slick Bayern move, initiated by Roque Santa Cruz, sliced through their rearguard although as yet the German side could not find an end product. But Santa Cruz had the last laugh, going down theatrically under the challenge of Silvestre to earn his side a penalty which Scholl slammed high into the net above the diving Barthez. Shortly into the second half, Beckham tested Kahn with a fizzing free-kick from outside the box and the big German keeper was again equal to the England midfielder when United were awarded a penalty in the 51st minute. Kahn's rash challenge felled Fortune as the South African tried to round him, but he pulled off a superb diving save to push away Beckham's ferocious spot-kick and preserve Bayern's lead. Scholl almost increased that lead when he arrived on the edge of the United box to hammer in a shot following Santa Cruz's lay-off and, moments later, Bayern did go two up when Jens Jeremies' flighted ball into the area was flicked into the roof of the net by the head of Zickler. Scholl caused United more trouble down the right and threaded the ball into the six-yard box. Silvestre cleared but soon afterwards the ball came back into the danger area from Michael Tarnat on the left and Silvestre was left grasping thin air as Zickler again eluded him to nod home Bayern's third.",

At Fulham's training ground in London's south-west suburbs, he exudes more English phlegm than French frenzy as he quietly puts the players through a training session before next weekend's kick-off. And afterwards, settled in his office in the curious Victorian pile that Fulham have converted into their administration block at Motspur Park - even the cornice in the stairwell is picked out in black and white - the Frenchman seems genuinely carefree. </p> <p>Tigana says he understands Fayed's desire for success. 'It's normal, you want to win. When I was a manager in France, it was the same. It's the same with all clubs. It's life. But it doesn't worry me. I work from morning to night to the maximum and therefore, whatever happens, I can have no regrets.' </p> <p>But the most convincing proof that Tigana is not overburdened by anxiety is provided by his appearance. Aged 45, he is still as trim as he was during his great playing days when his technical excellence compensated for lack of physical presence and made him an essential member of the famous midfield quartet - completed by Michel Platini, Alain Giresse and Luis Fernandez - that carried France to the 1984 European championship. </p> <p>His dark hair remains unflecked by grey and his eyes are bright and darting in a face whose smooth planes show no signs of ageing. One look at the man who continued his playing career with Olympique Marseille until the age of 36 must dispel any doubts the Fulham players may have about the diet-conscious regime that Tigana advocates, but insists he doesn't impose. </p> <p>Tigana's interests away from football have almost certainly helped to protect him from the toll that club management - in France, he has had successful spells in charge of Lyon and Monaco - has exacted from so many of those who have given themselves too completely to the job. </p> <p>He sold one vineyard near Bordeaux recently, but still owns another just north of Marseilles, which is not bad for a former postman who was born in Mali and came to France as a young boy when his father joined the French army. </p> <p>But a greater, and more important, distraction is his family. He says that one of the two reasons he decided to join Fulham was the cultural opportunity it offered him, his wife Carole and their three children. </p> <p>Although his older son, Yannick, who is 20, is staying behind to continue his education in France, Julien, 14, and his five-year-old daughter, Canelle, will both be going to London schools.

I'm very, very happy.' </p> <p>The second reason is that he is fired by the excitement of the challenge, not of performing some sort of missionary role spreading the word of French football, but of trying to gain Fulham promotion to the Premiership, a league for which he has considerable respect. </p> <p>'Because of Gerard Houllier and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, I have been watching the Premiership all the time, and I think it's a good competition.' </p> <p>He is reluctant to admit that Fayed's money is a third reason for his having come to a First Division side, but he concedes that the training facilities, in which Fulham have invested heavily over the past 18 months, were a factor in persuading him to join. The promise of an expensively revamped Craven Cottage - a planning application is due to go before Hammersmith council in the autumn - was also 'very, very important'. </p> <p>From the point of view of entering the transfer market, though, he points out that having a treasure chest to strengthen the squad has been of little help given that players of the quality he would like - both British and foreign - are not prepared to join a First Division side, albeit it one that can offer so much in immediate comforts and the prospect of imminent greater ones. </p> <p>He has made only two significant purchases, the 21-year-old striker Louis Saha for \u00a32.1 million from the French club Metz, a deal that was financed anyway by selling Geoff Horsfield to Birmingham, and John Collins, the Scottish midfielder who played for Tigana at Monaco, for \u00a32.2 million. </p> <p>Tigana regards Collins as something of a model for the rest of his squad: very good on the pitch, which he regards as 60 per cent of a player's contribution, and a fine example off it, which accounts for the other 40 per cent and includes such things as being careful about diet and conscientious about stretching exercises that can prevent injury. </p> <p>At the same time, it is easy to believe Tigana when he says he is happy that the reluctance of blue-chip players to come to Fulham gives him the chance to develop youngsters such as the 20-year-old midfielder Sean Davis, who featured strongly in Fulham's goalless draw with Tottenham last week. 'In my dream,' he says, 'I want to train a young English player who after three to five years gets into the England team. This is my vision.'

Yeah. I began playing at Fulham in 1950. So, yeah, yeah, that's right. Fifty years...\" </p> <p> Robson pauses to reflect on this remarkable accomplishment for, maybe, four seconds, then erases the subject from his mind.\"OK,\" he says. \"So what is it you want to talk about then?\" </p> <p> The grand old man of English football (he is 67) does not, by nature, dwell on things past, on his England career as player and manager, on the trophies he has accumulated as a coach in English, Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish football. He is far too consumed by the here and now. By the task at hand at the latest club to hire him, the club he supported as child, Newcastle United. </p> <p> A couple of hours earlier, he is inside St James' Park, on the terraces behind one of the goals, utterly absorbed by the stealthy upward movement of a hydraulic crane. \"Look at that, eh? Will you look at that!\" Robson stares, eyes wide with wonder, as the giant mechanism eases its trunk up towards the stadium roof. Blessed with a range of expression and breadth of gesticulation that Kenneth Branagh would be pressed to match, Robson is the most enthusiastic man in football. Age cannot wither the passion for life, for football, of the most successful England manager since Sir Alf Ramsey.</p> <p> Nor can a stiff leg. Less than 24 hours earlier surgeons had pulled out half the cartilage in his left knee. When he thinks about it, or when he stands up after sitting still for a while, he grimaces in pain. But he doesn't think about it very much. What is it we're going to talk about, then?</p> <p> The evolution of the game, how coaches, tactics, players have changed; about the things that have stayed the same. He nods, and his face becomes a picture of concentration. And he talks for the next three hours.</p> <p> <strong> The Fifties </strong></p> <p> Coaching didn't exist when Robson, aged 17, started playing professionally for Fulham, then one of the leading English clubs. Preparation for a First Division match consisted, he says, of \"Five, Four, Three, Two, One - run five laps, walk one, run four, walk one, and so on. We'd ask, 'Can we have a ball for training?' And the reply would come: 'What do you want a ball for? You'll get one on Saturday. That was the way it was in every club.\"</p> <p> And team talks? What was his manager, Bill Dodgin, telling them? \"Very little. We'd be up against, say, Man United and you'd just play your natural game. The manager picked a team, he had this 'WM' formation, told each player where to go. 'You can head the ball so you play centre half,' and so on. We might be losing at half-time and he'd say nothing tactical. More like, 'What d'you make that mistake for? How could you miss that one?\".</p> <p> The WM formation? Robson grabs a pen and paper. \"Everybody in England used it. No one imagined you could play any other way. I mean, the war had only ended five years earlier...\"</p> <p>He begins to draw dots. \"You had two wingers and a centre forward, two inside forwards, two midfielders, a centre half and two full backs.\" He makes a dot for each position, then joins the dots, five in the shape of a W, five in a superimposed M (try it at home, it sort of works).</p> <p> Today the WM might be called a 5-3-2, or a 3-2-3-2. In those days maths was not the strong point of the game's cognoscenti. </p> <p> Robson identifies the moment he realised English football was, tactically at least, in the dark ages. He was at Wembley in 1953 and watched the Hungarians put six past England. \"You might think now that our tactics, or lack of them, were a bit crude, but we still reckoned we were the best in the world. And then the Hungarians beat us 6-3. First time England had ever been beaten at home. I'll never forget it. Near-post crosses, far-post crosses, two wingers working in tandem, the double centre forward.\"<br> And the Hungarians did know their maths. </p> <p>\"Oh yeah. They put a player there,\" (he marks dots on paper again) \"they put two against the centre half, four defenders against three attackers - they played 4-2-4. We'd never seen anything like that! And then they'd switch to 4-4-2. They hammered us! Because against our old WM their system did us in. But also - ah! - what play!\"</p> <p> Robson starts waving his arms around, eyes like a madman. He waxes so lyrical he starts to sound, and look, like Hamlet on a roll. \"Their touch, their passing, their spinning, their dribbling ability, their crossing, the overlapping play of the two full-backs! And the support play - one man on the ball and always two to give it to. Their football was scintillating. It had width, it had depth. It was compact. It moved like a train.\"</p> <p> Robson accepted an offer to take lessons in a revolutionary new discipline at the London Football Coaches' Association. \"Don Howe, Ron Greenwood, Jimmy Hill came along too, all of us interested in coaching, all of us having seen the Hungarians take the game to a higher plane, wanting England to play at that level.\" </p> <p> If the tactics were unrecognisable to today's players, so too were the finances. \"I was paid \u00a37 a week in the winter, \u00a36 in the summer. I was a young boy of 17 but even the maximum salary at that time - I think I'm right in saying this - was \u00a310 in the winter and \u00a38 in the summer. </p> <p>\"So if you were Stanley Matthews or Tom Finney, the best in the game, that's all you could earn. Plus a bonus, set by the FA, of \u00a32 for a win and \u00a31 for a draw. Which meant that, other than your personal motivation, there was little financial incentive to do better because, however great you were, nobody paid you any more money.\"</p> <p> What was more, the conditions of employment amounted to a form of slave labour. \"Yeah. Slave labour. The clubs retained the players' registration as professionals. You could not leave without their permission. If you wanted a transfer and the club denied it you could do nothing about it. If you insisted on leaving they could put you out of the game, they froze you out of football, until you eventually came back to them begging.\"</p> <p> The fans were different, too. \"No hassle, no punch-ups, no blasphemy. Not even chants, songs.\" No 'there's only one Bobby Robson!'? \"Oh no, no. None of that. Even after I played my first games for England I could walk down Putney High Street without anybody recognising me. \"</p> <p><strong> The Sixties</strong></p> <p> Football in England made \"a huge leap\", Robson says, between 1950 and 1966. Two critical developments set the stage for England's World Cup victory: the abolition of the maximum wage, and the dramatic evolution of coaching.</p> <p> \"In 1960 the maximum wage went up to \u00a320. But the players weren't satisfied. We asked for \u00a35 a week more. The clubs, the FA said no. So we went on strike. That was in 61-62. Jimmy Hill, who was very eloquent, was our spokesman. We went all the way. And we won. Johnny Haynes became the first \u00a3100 a week player - five times the previous salary! Nobody could believe it! Suddenly there was a financial incentive to become a better player.\"</p> <p> Ramsey plotted England's World Cup triumph but the man Robson credits with having laid the foundations is Ramsey's predecessor, Walter Winterbottom.</p> <p> \"Walter did more than anyone to to modernise English football. Now it wasn't 'what do you want a ball for?' any more. Walter understood that if you didn't train with the ball in the week when it came to Saturday you wouldn't know what do with it. So under his guidance, planned training, varied training, shooting practice, crossing practice all became part of the game. All clubs now were looking for training grounds. Before, they trained inside the stadium, ran around the block. Hardly surprisingly, pace went up, skill went up.\"</p> <p> Robson's first glimpse - and glimpse is the word - of the Brazilian phenomenon came during a World Cup game in 1958. \"I played for England there, at inside right. It was the hardest football I've ever played in my life. It was at a pace I'd never known, against a class of player I'd never seen on the same pitch. They had a lightness we did not have, an exquisite touch. Somehow, we drew that game 0-0. Pele came into the side in the next match, at 17. That was it. That was the year Brazilian football exploded on the world scene. Fabulous!\"</p> <p> If the game became more beautiful, it was also in good measure because of the change in the characteristics of the ball. \"It was lighter, weatherproof. When I started we had this leather ball that absorbed water. It was like heading a bloody cannonball. Kicking it more than 60 metres was a terrific feat. Now with the new ball, which is basically the one we use today, you could ping it 60 yards with precision. Pinging wasn't an option in the 1950s.\"</p> <p> Football not only became a better spectacle, with the 1966 victory the game acquired a new fascination in England. \"People think football was always as popular in England as it is today. Well it wasn't. After the '66 World Cup the game's popularity shot up. Attendances the following season were dramatically higher. And now you had a huge demand for televised football. Players suddenly became instantly recognisable on the streets, to become celebrities in their own right - George Best was the first of his kind in England. And there was a terrific spin-off commercially. The textile trade took off - shirts, scarves, merchandise. In the Fifties football had been a game. In the Sixties it was becoming an industry.\"</p> <p><strong> The Seventies</strong></p> <p> After the defeat by West Germany in the 1970 World Cup, the national side had a run of abysmal failure despite a generation of wonderfully skilful English players. \"Yeah. Yeah. You had Hudson, Osgood, Bowles, Marsh, Tony Currie. The sort of talent you were more used to seeing on the continent. But they didn't get a regular run in the England set-up. Maybe some of those players lacked a bit of behavioural attitude, of discipline.\"</p> <p> Unable to afford to bring such players to Ipswich, Robson instead initiated a revolution. In 1978 he brought two of the first foreign (or rather non-British or Irish) players into the English game - the Dutchmen Arnold Muhren and Frans Thijssen. </p> <p> Why? \"We'd become a bit stereotyped. We got the ball from the back to the forwards very quickly and did not play through the midfield very much. And so we lost the ball too much. If you over-hit or under-hit, you lost the ball. The long ball is the best ball in the game if it's spot-on (Hoddle was the great long-ball player in those days). But you only get seven or eight of those precision long balls in a match. You can't get 30. The percentage returns of the long-ball game are not good. </p> <p>\"So we had to bring in a change. To play through the midfield, not bypassing it. Play it in stages, shorten our game. We looked and looked but I could not find the player I needed in England - the best ones were in the big clubs. So we went abroad and I found two, the two Dutchmen.</p> <p> \"The Holland team that made the World Cup final in 1974 and 1978 didn't win but they were the Hungarians of the Seventies. They brought the game to a new level, a new tactical plane. They played without a centre forward, remember? Cruyff and Neeskens sat back, and the two opposing centre halves didn't know who to mark.\"</p> <p> That was the team that invented total football. \"Yeah. And you know what total football is? Every player in the team is a footballer. Every player - the centre half, the full backs - could dribble, pass, control it. Everyone played like an inside forward. Everyone could keep possession. The Dutch then were like the Hungarians because you could say there was a before and an after. They set a new standard. And the starting point was that they kept possession, rarely lost it.</p> <p> The danger with that game is that you sometimes overplay, end up after nine passes where you began. But the good Dutch teams had the players to add penetration to possession. That's the secret of any team: play to the players' strengths. They didn't have any great headers of the ball, so they played ground football, which was a great, great game to watch.\"</p> <p><strong> The Eighties</strong></p> <p> The Eighties was a decade of new ideas. Of constantly changing patterns of play.</p> <p> \"For example, a coach would see the other team play 4-2-4 and he'd shift to 4-3-3 to dominate the midfield and create some space. A lot of teams shifted to 4-3-3. So then others said, OK, now we'll go to 4-4-2. You play three in midfield, we'll play four. Always what you're doing is trying to have a spare man, to create numerical superiority. That's the point. And now teams play five in midfield, 3-5-2. But there comes a time when you can't change any more. You can't put six in midfield, because there's no space. There are only four or five realistic systems. But the main thing is to be able to adapt the system to your players.\"</p> <p> Tactically, the team Robson most admired during his England reign was France. \"Funny that. It was not so long before that we thought of France as a poor footballing nation. We played them in my first game as an England player. I scored twice and we won 4-0. But look at that team, so unlucky not to win the 1982 World Cup. What the coach [Michel Hidalgo] did was really imaginative. He played with one winger, one front player, and no player on the right at all.\"</p> <p> Robson grabs his pen and paper again and starts furiously drawing arrows, more dots.\"The team was built on the midfield trio of Platini, Giresse and Tigana. Platini, who could thread the ball through the eye of a needle, was in the hole, looking for the counter-attack, doing next to no defensive work. When France regained the ball they passed it to him. Behind Platini was little Giresse, knitting the midfield with the back four. Tigana had amazing pace and endurance. He did not operate wide, but he worked the right channel up and down. What you had here was a clever coach who was aware of his weaknesses and found a way of playing that suited his players, while at the same time causing confusion in the opposing team. I mean, what do you say to those two guys playing on the right in the other team who have no one to mark? No one mastered that problem.\"</p> <p> Hidalgo, in other words, got the best out of his best players and made a virtue of his deficiencies. Did his wit offer any lessons to the current England side, whose lament is the absence of left-sided players? Robson does not rise to the bait. \"Mmm,\" he says. \"Mmm, What you do, is you get by. You find a way to get by.\"</p> <p> Robson did a lot more than get by when he was England coach. But did he impose a discernible, Bobby Robson system of play on his teams? He pauses to reflect. \"Well, look,\" he says,\"first of all I always liked wingers. Later at Barcelona, for example, I played with Figo on the right and Luis Enrique on the left. I think that when you're in trouble the easiest, safest, thing is to pass it wide. Then, as to what you do with it, I was lucky to have players like Barnes and Waddle, and Kenny Sansom coming up from left back. </p> <p>\"What maybe set my team apart from other England teams was that we played ground football. We had to. Beardsley and Lineker were this high.\" He gestures with his hand at chest height. \"I couldn't hit the high ball down the middle, or long crosses to the back post. As for the system, it was 4-2-4 or 4-4-2 - the two are basically interchangeable - because that is the system we most play in England. </p> <p>\"But you*ve got to be flexible at the highest level. And if in a World Cup we came across opposing strikers who might be too good, we brought in a sweeper - Mark Wright - to drop off and play behind everybody.\" Try as Robson does to impose some science on the game, there is always the luck factor. \"Yeah, sure, yeah,\" says Robson, who was knocked out of one World Cup by the 'hand of God', another by penalties.</p> <p> \"You can't buy critical decisions that go against you. Or players that under-perform, way below their level in club football.\" Whereupon, for the first time, he ventures a criticism of the current England team. \"Look at Dennis Wise, who is a little hubbub of a player for Chelsea but played so poorly for England in Euro 2000. </p> <p>\"He played nowhere near his club form, like several others. This is what you find as England coach. That there are players who don't cope with the pressure. Who can handle things in their own sitting room, but can't handle going to meet the Queen at the palace. You've got to find out about those players, because they'll let you down. They'll crumble on the day. They'll shirk the responsibility. They'll disappear.\"</p> <p> The best example Robson came across of a player who did not shirk his responsibility, ever, was Bryan Robson. \"He could play anywhere in the world at the same level, whether it was the Azteca Stadium or Crewe Alexandra. The world stage did not frighten him. Nothing did.\"</p> <p><strong> The Nineties</strong></p> <p> The football industry, fattened by all the money television poured in, became fully globalised. Players, and coaches no longer felt any constraint to play their football in the land where they were born. Robson offers a perfect illustration of the trend. </p> <p>Upon leaving the England job in 1990 he headed to PSV Eindhoven, setting off on a pilgrimage that took him to Lisbon, to Porto, to Barcelona and back to PSV, before returning home to take over the Newcastle job from Ruud Gullit at the end of 1999. Why all this movement?</p> <p> \"There are three reasons, basically. One is money. Two, experience. And three, success. I went abroad to get an education, but I also doubled the salary I had as England manager.\"</p> <p> What did he learn in Holland? \"That the possession game comes first, penetration later. That passing well is the key.\" Why can't the English do this? \"It's because we believe in the tennis game of football. We believe in getting the ball forward and getting it forward early. So we think the first pass must be a front pass. It's not on abroad, is it? What you see is that they get in a difficult position, a cul-de-sac, and so what do they do? They bring it back, play it square, start again. We don't do that.\" But the English understand this is how the game should be played, don't they? \"I suppose so. The problem, maybe, is that we need the confidence and we lack the skill factor.\"</p> <p> Which is why, following Robson's old Arnold Muhren principle, English managers look abroad. \"You'll never get a Newcastle team with 11 Geordies now. The best you can do is retain a British nucleus. I am trying to do that at Newcastle. But beyond that, you're dreaming.\" But is this new reality good for the game? \"Well, we're getting used to it now, but it's bad for the national side, no doubt about it. We've even got, disastrously, some clubs whose reserves are full of foreigners, so where is the English player getting a chance?\" Yet Robson has just bought two Argentines. \"Well, yeah,\" he shrugs, chuckling. \"I am a hypocrite. But I am trying like everybody else to get success. It's a Catch 22, but I like everybody else have to start buying foreign players. And we'll do so till the country starts producing good ones of its own.\" </p> <p>What did he find had changed for the better when he returned to English football? \"A lot. Much greater professionalism. More attention to diets, to getting just the right protein and carbohydrate intake at just the right time. More scientific monitoring of fitness levels. Greater seriousness from the players, greater awareness that their careers are short and they had better look after their bodies.\"</p> <p> That said, Robson was shocked to discover how deep the English culture of drunkenness remained, not just among the fans, but among the top players. \"You try to stop them from drinking alcohol but they still like a drink, more in England than in any other country I know. In Portugal they never drank, in Barcelona they never drank. It's a cultural thing. It's been in the game a long time, and the young players come in, meet it, get the swing of it, and become the same. Not every player, but there is far too much drinking of alcohol in English football, far too many players getting drunk at weekends.\"</p> <p><strong> What's changed in 50 years</strong><br></p> <p>What strikes Robson is how dramatically the manager's job has evolved. \"You've got to be so meticulous in your preparations. There's a lot more one-to-ones with players, analysing their games, trying to personalise their coaching to make them better players - which is now what the coach's job is supposed to be, in large measure. As for team talks, the sorts of things I'd say in my Ipswich days were much more general. Like, 'they take the long throw, watch out for the long throw.' That's not sufficient now. Now I say that for the long throw I want you in front of that player, and you get behind him and, between the two of you, sandwich him in.\"</p> <p> At Barcelona, where he had difficulty with the language, he used flip charts to explain tactics. He liked the system, and uses it still. \"I spend about 90 minutes preparing the charts, about 16 pages in all.\" Using the wall of his lounge, he acts out the part of a coach with his flip-chart. \"I mark down each player for each particular duty: for an attacking corner and defensive corner; how to line up against a lateral free-kick, where precisely each player should stand; how far back or forward the last line of defence should be, depending on the angle of approach of the ball. I have a separate sketch for each permutation.\"</p> <p> The key question is whether all these sophistications have improved the quality of the game.</p> <p> \"Oh yes. Yes. Absolutely. I remember Walter Winterbottom telling me, when I played midfield for England, that a midfield player does about 6,000 yards in a match - 2,000 yards of that in sprint form, and another 4,000 in checking and going back and covering. Today it's about 10,000 metres, so that's nearly 5,000 yards more per match. If you'd said to me back in the Fifties that I'd have to run 5,000 yards more I would have told you it was not possible. So, for instance, you were the full back then, the message from the manager was, 'Don't you ever cross that halfway line! Your job is to defend!' Now look at the overlapping full back, look at Lizarazu, Roberto Carlos, Thuram - the ground they cover! \"As the game has got faster the technique has gone up. Because before you had time to get it down, look up. Before, if your first touch was bad and the ball bounced three or four yards, it was still your ball. Today, if you've miscontrolled it, you've lost it. Now the moment you get the ball there is someone at you. The pressure on the ball has increased manyfold. So, yes, the quality of skill has got dramatically better.\"</p> <p> Is it possible to compare teams today with teams when he began? \"Certainly. I can tell you without a shred of doubt: a good team today would murder a good team of the Fifties. A good game today is a much better game to watch than a good game in the Fifties or Sixties. Because the game has been progressing all the time.\"<br> On the other hand, the great players then, subjected to present conditions, would be great today. \"If Matthews or Finney played today they*d be fitter and faster and still brilliant. George Best would be George Best today. He'd probably be better.\"</p> <p> Perhaps the most obvious difference is in the incomes and lifestyles of the players. \"You can say that again! A professional who plays eight years today, if he is sensible, can avoid the need to ever work again. In my day you assumed you'd have to go back to work. That was why my parents insisted I finish my electrician's apprenticeship before I took up the game. We absolutely assumed that was what I'd do after I turned 30.\"</p> <p> As for the celebrity the players enjoy, and the power to control their own destinies they so patently lacked 50 years ago, it does pose new challenges. \"Before the players' respect for the manager was unquestioned. Now you have to work harder to get it, because top players, the ones you really don't want to lose, can threaten to leave. Ronaldo is the perfect example. He had an eight-year contract with Barcelona and after a year he was gone. But he was a good lad, all the same. He treated senior players with respect. He always listened to what I had to say. Except when I asked him to stay at Barca. But that was the agent's fault.\"</p> <p> Could he imagine a player having an agent in 1950? \"I can't. What for? There was nothing to negotiate. Now it's gone too far the other way. Some agents are good, but many are a nightmare - perpetuating the player's unrest, never satisfied. Always looking to get a bigger cut, even if it is against their player's long-term interests. As happened, tragically, with Ronaldo. I'll never forget what he said when I asked him, during the negotiations before he left for Inter Milan, what his agents' view was: 'They said, I need to play football and they need to make money. I have to listen to them.'\"</p> <p> That's a long way from the thoughts that occupied Robson as he strolled unnoticed down Putney High Street in the Fifties. So much has changed. What hasn't? \"I'll tell you what hasn't changed. I'll tell you what no amount of money can change,\" he says, his eyes lighting up, oozing devotion to the game that has been his life.</p> <p> \"The players play for the love of the game. They really do. Always. Money doesn't come into it when they're on the pitch. Once they are out there playing, it doesn't matter whether they are on 10 pounds or two million. That hasn't changed, and I don't believe it ever will. That stays the same. The love of the game, yes, that has always been the same.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bobby Robson is caught offside by the news that this coming season will mark his half century in professional football. He frowns hard, his eyes searching this way and that. \"Well, yeah, yeah...\" he says, with a scratch of the head. \"I suppose you're right. Yeah. I began playing at Fulham in 1950. So, yeah, yeah, that's right. Fifty years...\" Robson pauses to reflect on this remarkable accomplishment for, maybe, four seconds, then erases the subject from his mind.\"OK,\" he says. \"So what is it you want to talk about then?\" The grand old man of English football (he is 67) does not, by nature, dwell on things past, on his England career as player and manager, on the trophies he has accumulated as a coach in English, Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish football. He is far too consumed by the here and now. By the task at hand at the latest club to hire him, the club he supported as child, Newcastle United. A couple of hours earlier, he is inside St James' Park, on the terraces behind one of the goals, utterly absorbed by the stealthy upward movement of a hydraulic crane. \"Look at that, eh? Will you look at that!\" Robson stares, eyes wide with wonder, as the giant mechanism eases its trunk up towards the stadium roof. Blessed with a range of expression and breadth of gesticulation that Kenneth Branagh would be pressed to match, Robson is the most enthusiastic man in football. Age cannot wither the passion for life, for football, of the most successful England manager since Sir Alf Ramsey. Nor can a stiff leg. Less than 24 hours earlier surgeons had pulled out half the cartilage in his left knee. When he thinks about it, or when he stands up after sitting still for a while, he grimaces in pain. But he doesn't think about it very much. What is it we're going to talk about, then? The evolution of the game, how coaches, tactics, players have changed; about the things that have stayed the same. He nods, and his face becomes a picture of concentration. And he talks for the next three hours. The Fifties Coaching didn't exist when Robson, aged 17, started playing professionally for Fulham, then one of the leading English clubs. Preparation for a First Division match consisted, he says, of \"Five, Four, Three, Two, One - run five laps, walk one, run four, walk one, and so on. We'd ask, 'Can we have a ball for training?' And the reply would come: 'What do you want a ball for? You'll get one on Saturday. That was the way it was in every club.\" And team talks? What was his manager, Bill Dodgin, telling them? \"Very little. We'd be up against, say, Man United and you'd just play your natural game. The manager picked a team, he had this 'WM' formation, told each player where to go. 'You can head the ball so you play centre half,' and so on. We might be losing at half-time and he'd say nothing tactical. More like, 'What d'you make that mistake for? How could you miss that one?\". The WM formation? Robson grabs a pen and paper. \"Everybody in England used it. No one imagined you could play any other way. I mean, the war had only ended five years earlier...\" He begins to draw dots. \"You had two wingers and a centre forward, two inside forwards, two midfielders, a centre half and two full backs.\" He makes a dot for each position, then joins the dots, five in the shape of a W, five in a superimposed M (try it at home, it sort of works). Today the WM might be called a 5-3-2, or a 3-2-3-2. In those days maths was not the strong point of the game's cognoscenti. Robson identifies the moment he realised English football was, tactically at least, in the dark ages. He was at Wembley in 1953 and watched the Hungarians put six past England. \"You might think now that our tactics, or lack of them, were a bit crude, but we still reckoned we were the best in the world. And then the Hungarians beat us 6-3. First time England had ever been beaten at home. I'll never forget it. Near-post crosses, far-post crosses, two wingers working in tandem, the double centre forward.\" And the Hungarians did know their maths. \"Oh yeah. They put a player there,\" (he marks dots on paper again) \"they put two against the centre half, four defenders against three attackers - they played 4-2-4. We'd never seen anything like that! And then they'd switch to 4-4-2. They hammered us! Because against our old WM their system did us in. But also - ah! - what play!\" Robson starts waving his arms around, eyes like a madman. He waxes so lyrical he starts to sound, and look, like Hamlet on a roll. \"Their touch, their passing, their spinning, their dribbling ability, their crossing, the overlapping play of the two full-backs! And the support play - one man on the ball and always two to give it to. Their football was scintillating. It had width, it had depth. It was compact. It moved like a train.\" Robson accepted an offer to take lessons in a revolutionary new discipline at the London Football Coaches' Association. \"Don Howe, Ron Greenwood, Jimmy Hill came along too, all of us interested in coaching, all of us having seen the Hungarians take the game to a higher plane, wanting England to play at that level.\" If the tactics were unrecognisable to today's players, so too were the finances. \"I was paid \u00a37 a week in the winter, \u00a36 in the summer. I was a young boy of 17 but even the maximum salary at that time - I think I'm right in saying this - was \u00a310 in the winter and \u00a38 in the summer. \"So if you were Stanley Matthews or Tom Finney, the best in the game, that's all you could earn. Plus a bonus, set by the FA, of \u00a32 for a win and \u00a31 for a draw. Which meant that, other than your personal motivation, there was little financial incentive to do better because, however great you were, nobody paid you any more money.\" What was more, the conditions of employment amounted to a form of slave labour. \"Yeah. Slave labour. The clubs retained the players' registration as professionals. You could not leave without their permission. If you wanted a transfer and the club denied it you could do nothing about it. If you insisted on leaving they could put you out of the game, they froze you out of football, until you eventually came back to them begging.\" The fans were different, too. \"No hassle, no punch-ups, no blasphemy. Not even chants, songs.\" No 'there's only one Bobby Robson!'? \"Oh no, no. None of that. Even after I played my first games for England I could walk down Putney High Street without anybody recognising me. \" The Sixties Football in England made \"a huge leap\", Robson says, between 1950 and 1966. Two critical developments set the stage for England's World Cup victory: the abolition of the maximum wage, and the dramatic evolution of coaching. \"In 1960 the maximum wage went up to \u00a320. But the players weren't satisfied. We asked for \u00a35 a week more. The clubs, the FA said no. So we went on strike. That was in 61-62. Jimmy Hill, who was very eloquent, was our spokesman. We went all the way. And we won. Johnny Haynes became the first \u00a3100 a week player - five times the previous salary! Nobody could believe it! Suddenly there was a financial incentive to become a better player.\" Ramsey plotted England's World Cup triumph but the man Robson credits with having laid the foundations is Ramsey's predecessor, Walter Winterbottom. \"Walter did more than anyone to to modernise English football. Now it wasn't 'what do you want a ball for?' any more. Walter understood that if you didn't train with the ball in the week when it came to Saturday you wouldn't know what do with it. So under his guidance, planned training, varied training, shooting practice, crossing practice all became part of the game. All clubs now were looking for training grounds. Before, they trained inside the stadium, ran around the block. Hardly surprisingly, pace went up, skill went up.\" Robson's first glimpse - and glimpse is the word - of the Brazilian phenomenon came during a World Cup game in 1958. \"I played for England there, at inside right. It was the hardest football I've ever played in my life. It was at a pace I'd never known, against a class of player I'd never seen on the same pitch. They had a lightness we did not have, an exquisite touch. Somehow, we drew that game 0-0. Pele came into the side in the next match, at 17. That was it. That was the year Brazilian football exploded on the world scene. Fabulous!\" If the game became more beautiful, it was also in good measure because of the change in the characteristics of the ball. \"It was lighter, weatherproof. When I started we had this leather ball that absorbed water. It was like heading a bloody cannonball. Kicking it more than 60 metres was a terrific feat. Now with the new ball, which is basically the one we use today, you could ping it 60 yards with precision. Pinging wasn't an option in the 1950s.\" Football not only became a better spectacle, with the 1966 victory the game acquired a new fascination in England. \"People think football was always as popular in England as it is today. Well it wasn't. After the '66 World Cup the game's popularity shot up. Attendances the following season were dramatically higher. And now you had a huge demand for televised football. Players suddenly became instantly recognisable on the streets, to become celebrities in their own right - George Best was the first of his kind in England. And there was a terrific spin-off commercially. The textile trade took off - shirts, scarves, merchandise. In the Fifties football had been a game. In the Sixties it was becoming an industry.\" The Seventies After the defeat by West Germany in the 1970 World Cup, the national side had a run of abysmal failure despite a generation of wonderfully skilful English players. \"Yeah. Yeah. You had Hudson, Osgood, Bowles, Marsh, Tony Currie. The sort of talent you were more used to seeing on the continent. But they didn't get a regular run in the England set-up. Maybe some of those players lacked a bit of behavioural attitude, of discipline.\" Unable to afford to bring such players to Ipswich, Robson instead initiated a revolution. In 1978 he brought two of the first foreign (or rather non-British or Irish) players into the English game - the Dutchmen Arnold Muhren and Frans Thijssen. Why? \"We'd become a bit stereotyped. We got the ball from the back to the forwards very quickly and did not play through the midfield very much. And so we lost the ball too much. If you over-hit or under-hit, you lost the ball. The long ball is the best ball in the game if it's spot-on (Hoddle was the great long-ball player in those days). But you only get seven or eight of those precision long balls in a match. You can't get 30. The percentage returns of the long-ball game are not good. \"So we had to bring in a change. To play through the midfield, not bypassing it. Play it in stages, shorten our game. We looked and looked but I could not find the player I needed in England - the best ones were in the big clubs. So we went abroad and I found two, the two Dutchmen. \"The Holland team that made the World Cup final in 1974 and 1978 didn't win but they were the Hungarians of the Seventies. They brought the game to a new level, a new tactical plane. They played without a centre forward, remember? Cruyff and Neeskens sat back, and the two opposing centre halves didn't know who to mark.\" That was the team that invented total football. \"Yeah. And you know what total football is? Every player in the team is a footballer. Every player - the centre half, the full backs - could dribble, pass, control it. Everyone played like an inside forward. Everyone could keep possession. The Dutch then were like the Hungarians because you could say there was a before and an after. They set a new standard. And the starting point was that they kept possession, rarely lost it. The danger with that game is that you sometimes overplay, end up after nine passes where you began. But the good Dutch teams had the players to add penetration to possession. That's the secret of any team: play to the players' strengths. They didn't have any great headers of the ball, so they played ground football, which was a great, great game to watch.\" The Eighties The Eighties was a decade of new ideas. Of constantly changing patterns of play. \"For example, a coach would see the other team play 4-2-4 and he'd shift to 4-3-3 to dominate the midfield and create some space. A lot of teams shifted to 4-3-3. So then others said, OK, now we'll go to 4-4-2. You play three in midfield, we'll play four. Always what you're doing is trying to have a spare man, to create numerical superiority. That's the point. And now teams play five in midfield, 3-5-2. But there comes a time when you can't change any more. You can't put six in midfield, because there's no space. There are only four or five realistic systems. But the main thing is to be able to adapt the system to your players.\" Tactically, the team Robson most admired during his England reign was France. \"Funny that. It was not so long before that we thought of France as a poor footballing nation. We played them in my first game as an England player. I scored twice and we won 4-0. But look at that team, so unlucky not to win the 1982 World Cup. What the coach [Michel Hidalgo] did was really imaginative. He played with one winger, one front player, and no player on the right at all.\" Robson grabs his pen and paper again and starts furiously drawing arrows, more dots.\"The team was built on the midfield trio of Platini, Giresse and Tigana. Platini, who could thread the ball through the eye of a needle, was in the hole, looking for the counter-attack, doing next to no defensive work. When France regained the ball they passed it to him. Behind Platini was little Giresse, knitting the midfield with the back four. Tigana had amazing pace and endurance. He did not operate wide, but he worked the right channel up and down. What you had here was a clever coach who was aware of his weaknesses and found a way of playing that suited his players, while at the same time causing confusion in the opposing team. I mean, what do you say to those two guys playing on the right in the other team who have no one to mark? No one mastered that problem.\" Hidalgo, in other words, got the best out of his best players and made a virtue of his deficiencies. Did his wit offer any lessons to the current England side, whose lament is the absence of left-sided players? Robson does not rise to the bait. \"Mmm,\" he says. \"Mmm, What you do, is you get by. You find a way to get by.\" Robson did a lot more than get by when he was England coach. But did he impose a discernible, Bobby Robson system of play on his teams? He pauses to reflect. \"Well, look,\" he says,\"first of all I always liked wingers. Later at Barcelona, for example, I played with Figo on the right and Luis Enrique on the left. I think that when you're in trouble the easiest, safest, thing is to pass it wide. Then, as to what you do with it, I was lucky to have players like Barnes and Waddle, and Kenny Sansom coming up from left back. \"What maybe set my team apart from other England teams was that we played ground football. We had to. Beardsley and Lineker were this high.\" He gestures with his hand at chest height. \"I couldn't hit the high ball down the middle, or long crosses to the back post. As for the system, it was 4-2-4 or 4-4-2 - the two are basically interchangeable - because that is the system we most play in England. \"But you*ve got to be flexible at the highest level. And if in a World Cup we came across opposing strikers who might be too good, we brought in a sweeper - Mark Wright - to drop off and play behind everybody.\" Try as Robson does to impose some science on the game, there is always the luck factor. \"Yeah, sure, yeah,\" says Robson, who was knocked out of one World Cup by the 'hand of God', another by penalties. \"You can't buy critical decisions that go against you. Or players that under-perform, way below their level in club football.\" Whereupon, for the first time, he ventures a criticism of the current England team. \"Look at Dennis Wise, who is a little hubbub of a player for Chelsea but played so poorly for England in Euro 2000. \"He played nowhere near his club form, like several others. This is what you find as England coach. That there are players who don't cope with the pressure. Who can handle things in their own sitting room, but can't handle going to meet the Queen at the palace. You've got to find out about those players, because they'll let you down. They'll crumble on the day. They'll shirk the responsibility. They'll disappear.\" The best example Robson came across of a player who did not shirk his responsibility, ever, was Bryan Robson. \"He could play anywhere in the world at the same level, whether it was the Azteca Stadium or Crewe Alexandra. The world stage did not frighten him. Nothing did.\" The Nineties The football industry, fattened by all the money television poured in, became fully globalised. Players, and coaches no longer felt any constraint to play their football in the land where they were born. Robson offers a perfect illustration of the trend. Upon leaving the England job in 1990 he headed to PSV Eindhoven, setting off on a pilgrimage that took him to Lisbon, to Porto, to Barcelona and back to PSV, before returning home to take over the Newcastle job from Ruud Gullit at the end of 1999. Why all this movement? \"There are three reasons, basically. One is money. Two, experience. And three, success. I went abroad to get an education, but I also doubled the salary I had as England manager.\" What did he learn in Holland? \"That the possession game comes first, penetration later. That passing well is the key.\" Why can't the English do this? \"It's because we believe in the tennis game of football. We believe in getting the ball forward and getting it forward early. So we think the first pass must be a front pass. It's not on abroad, is it? What you see is that they get in a difficult position, a cul-de-sac, and so what do they do? They bring it back, play it square, start again. We don't do that.\" But the English understand this is how the game should be played, don't they? \"I suppose so. The problem, maybe, is that we need the confidence and we lack the skill factor.\" Which is why, following Robson's old Arnold Muhren principle, English managers look abroad. \"You'll never get a Newcastle team with 11 Geordies now. The best you can do is retain a British nucleus. I am trying to do that at Newcastle. But beyond that, you're dreaming.\" But is this new reality good for the game? \"Well, we're getting used to it now, but it's bad for the national side, no doubt about it. We've even got, disastrously, some clubs whose reserves are full of foreigners, so where is the English player getting a chance?\" Yet Robson has just bought two Argentines. \"Well, yeah,\" he shrugs, chuckling. \"I am a hypocrite. But I am trying like everybody else to get success. It's a Catch 22, but I like everybody else have to start buying foreign players. And we'll do so till the country starts producing good ones of its own.\" What did he find had changed for the better when he returned to English football? \"A lot. Much greater professionalism. More attention to diets, to getting just the right protein and carbohydrate intake at just the right time. More scientific monitoring of fitness levels. Greater seriousness from the players, greater awareness that their careers are short and they had better look after their bodies.\" That said, Robson was shocked to discover how deep the English culture of drunkenness remained, not just among the fans, but among the top players. \"You try to stop them from drinking alcohol but they still like a drink, more in England than in any other country I know. In Portugal they never drank, in Barcelona they never drank. It's a cultural thing. It's been in the game a long time, and the young players come in, meet it, get the swing of it, and become the same. Not every player, but there is far too much drinking of alcohol in English football, far too many players getting drunk at weekends.\" What's changed in 50 years What strikes Robson is how dramatically the manager's job has evolved. \"You've got to be so meticulous in your preparations. There's a lot more one-to-ones with players, analysing their games, trying to personalise their coaching to make them better players - which is now what the coach's job is supposed to be, in large measure. As for team talks, the sorts of things I'd say in my Ipswich days were much more general. Like, 'they take the long throw, watch out for the long throw.' That's not sufficient now. Now I say that for the long throw I want you in front of that player, and you get behind him and, between the two of you, sandwich him in.\" At Barcelona, where he had difficulty with the language, he used flip charts to explain tactics. He liked the system, and uses it still. \"I spend about 90 minutes preparing the charts, about 16 pages in all.\" Using the wall of his lounge, he acts out the part of a coach with his flip-chart. \"I mark down each player for each particular duty: for an attacking corner and defensive corner; how to line up against a lateral free-kick, where precisely each player should stand; how far back or forward the last line of defence should be, depending on the angle of approach of the ball. I have a separate sketch for each permutation.\" The key question is whether all these sophistications have improved the quality of the game. \"Oh yes. Yes. Absolutely. I remember Walter Winterbottom telling me, when I played midfield for England, that a midfield player does about 6,000 yards in a match - 2,000 yards of that in sprint form, and another 4,000 in checking and going back and covering. Today it's about 10,000 metres, so that's nearly 5,000 yards more per match. If you'd said to me back in the Fifties that I'd have to run 5,000 yards more I would have told you it was not possible. So, for instance, you were the full back then, the message from the manager was, 'Don't you ever cross that halfway line! Your job is to defend!' Now look at the overlapping full back, look at Lizarazu, Roberto Carlos, Thuram - the ground they cover! \"As the game has got faster the technique has gone up. Because before you had time to get it down, look up. Before, if your first touch was bad and the ball bounced three or four yards, it was still your ball. Today, if you've miscontrolled it, you've lost it. Now the moment you get the ball there is someone at you. The pressure on the ball has increased manyfold. So, yes, the quality of skill has got dramatically better.\" Is it possible to compare teams today with teams when he began? \"Certainly. I can tell you without a shred of doubt: a good team today would murder a good team of the Fifties. A good game today is a much better game to watch than a good game in the Fifties or Sixties. Because the game has been progressing all the time.\" On the other hand, the great players then, subjected to present conditions, would be great today. \"If Matthews or Finney played today they*d be fitter and faster and still brilliant. George Best would be George Best today. He'd probably be better.\" Perhaps the most obvious difference is in the incomes and lifestyles of the players. \"You can say that again! A professional who plays eight years today, if he is sensible, can avoid the need to ever work again. In my day you assumed you'd have to go back to work. That was why my parents insisted I finish my electrician's apprenticeship before I took up the game. We absolutely assumed that was what I'd do after I turned 30.\" As for the celebrity the players enjoy, and the power to control their own destinies they so patently lacked 50 years ago, it does pose new challenges. \"Before the players' respect for the manager was unquestioned. Now you have to work harder to get it, because top players, the ones you really don't want to lose, can threaten to leave. Ronaldo is the perfect example. He had an eight-year contract with Barcelona and after a year he was gone. But he was a good lad, all the same. He treated senior players with respect. He always listened to what I had to say. Except when I asked him to stay at Barca. But that was the agent's fault.\" Could he imagine a player having an agent in 1950? \"I can't. What for? There was nothing to negotiate. Now it's gone too far the other way. Some agents are good, but many are a nightmare - perpetuating the player's unrest, never satisfied. Always looking to get a bigger cut, even if it is against their player's long-term interests. As happened, tragically, with Ronaldo. I'll never forget what he said when I asked him, during the negotiations before he left for Inter Milan, what his agents' view was: 'They said, I need to play football and they need to make money. I have to listen to them.'\" That's a long way from the thoughts that occupied Robson as he strolled unnoticed down Putney High Street in the Fifties. So much has changed. What hasn't? \"I'll tell you what hasn't changed. I'll tell you what no amount of money can change,\" he says, his eyes lighting up, oozing devotion to the game that has been his life. \"The players play for the love of the game. They really do. Always. Money doesn't come into it when they're on the pitch. Once they are out there playing, it doesn't matter whether they are on 10 pounds or two million. That hasn't changed, and I don't believe it ever will. That stays the same. The love of the game, yes, that has always been the same.\"",

      "body": "<p>When George Weah trotted out for his Manchester City debut at Edgeley Park he did so with the faintly condescending air of someone unaccustomed to such homely surroundings. By the time he drooped off 90 minutes later, City's optimism having been comprehensively sandbagged by the poor relations, it had probably dawned on him that he could well be back here next season. He certainly swelled the gate for Jim Gannon's testimonial game. Weah had not even managed to touch the ball by the time Stockport took the lead. Not surprising really, as the match was only 35 seconds old when Ian Moore picked up the ball on the right and cut through a non-existent City defence to find the top corner of the net with insolent ease. </p> <p>If that goal was cheeky, the next was positively disdainful. When the ponderous Alfie Haaland was caught out by Kevin Cooper after 12 minutes and was penalised for the clumsiest of fouls on the edge of his area, Tony Dinning exposed Weaver's poor positioning by nonchalantly clipping in the free-kick off his right-hand post. </p> <p>Weah by this time had had his first meaningful touch, from which he silkily set Jeff Whitley free, but nothing came of the shot and City fans were already beginning to realise that half a dozen former World Footballers of the Year up front might not compensate for a defence that looks certain to be torn to shreds in the Premiership. </p> <p>Richard Jobson is getting too old, Gerard Wiekens is still unpredictable and new signing Haaland was simply an embarrassment. Constantly caught on the turn by Cooper's pace and sternly spoken to for a cynical foul on the County winger midway through the first half, Haaland finally exhausted the referee's patience with a bad challenge on Karim Fradin after 36 minutes. As the foul occurred right in front of the City bench, Mr Mathieson instructed the visitors to withdraw Haaland or see him dismissed, they immediately sent Kevin Horlock on. </p> <p>City should have pulled a goal back in the 22nd minute, when a Lee Crooks cross found Weah unmarked, but he sent his volley high into the stand.

      "bodyText": "When George Weah trotted out for his Manchester City debut at Edgeley Park he did so with the faintly condescending air of someone unaccustomed to such homely surroundings. By the time he drooped off 90 minutes later, City's optimism having been comprehensively sandbagged by the poor relations, it had probably dawned on him that he could well be back here next season. He certainly swelled the gate for Jim Gannon's testimonial game. Weah had not even managed to touch the ball by the time Stockport took the lead. Not surprising really, as the match was only 35 seconds old when Ian Moore picked up the ball on the right and cut through a non-existent City defence to find the top corner of the net with insolent ease. If that goal was cheeky, the next was positively disdainful. When the ponderous Alfie Haaland was caught out by Kevin Cooper after 12 minutes and was penalised for the clumsiest of fouls on the edge of his area, Tony Dinning exposed Weaver's poor positioning by nonchalantly clipping in the free-kick off his right-hand post. Weah by this time had had his first meaningful touch, from which he silkily set Jeff Whitley free, but nothing came of the shot and City fans were already beginning to realise that half a dozen former World Footballers of the Year up front might not compensate for a defence that looks certain to be torn to shreds in the Premiership. Richard Jobson is getting too old, Gerard Wiekens is still unpredictable and new signing Haaland was simply an embarrassment. Constantly caught on the turn by Cooper's pace and sternly spoken to for a cynical foul on the County winger midway through the first half, Haaland finally exhausted the referee's patience with a bad challenge on Karim Fradin after 36 minutes. As the foul occurred right in front of the City bench, Mr Mathieson instructed the visitors to withdraw Haaland or see him dismissed, they immediately sent Kevin Horlock on. City should have pulled a goal back in the 22nd minute, when a Lee Crooks cross found Weah unmarked, but he sent his volley high into the stand. The former Milan player was finally able to celebrate his return to red and black stripes with a goal when he forced home a header from Mark Kennedy's corner in the second half. As County were by now three goals up, however, courtesy of Fradin's joyous far post finish to Dinning's deep cross from the right four minutes after the interval, it was all fairly academic. Cooper and Moore conjured a fourth goal before the end to emphasise County's superiority.

      "body": "<p>Following England's Euro 2000 debacle, attention this season will be trained on young players with the potential to return some optimism to the national game. One such could well be Nottingham Forest's 18-year-old midfield prodigy <strong> David Prutton.</strong> Prutton, all 6ft 1in of him, is a leggy runner, strong in the tackle and developing his passing ability apace, being a quick and willing learner. He has already trained with the England under-21 squad prior to their departure for their own European championship finals in May. 'He could quite easily go on to get international honours. I would be surprised if he wasn't in an under-21 squad this season,' says his Forest manager David Platt. 'He's come back and his passing's better. Perhaps it's that bit of experience, perhaps the summer has given him a chance to reflect. His awareness is also there. He mustn't lose his fundamentals, mainly the work rate. He closes down like nothing you have ever seen and snaps into the tackle. He picked up a few yellow cards last season, but he's not dirty.' Such is Prutton's progress that Platt will move him infield from the right side of midfield to increase his influence. 'He's got pace,' adds Platt. 'He's not an out-and-out passer, though he'll pass it all right, at the right pace, and keep the ball moving, but he's not going to see a really clever pass. I think he can score more goals this season. He's been working on hitting the target more. After every session he will go and strike 50 balls into an empty net. 'He is intelligent and tries things. He listens and takes things on board, takes things from every game. And there are no airs and graces, no edge to him. If you had 25 of him your squad you wouldn't have a problem. Big clubs are aware of him. Several managers have asked about him but we haven't received any bids. This season will be a big test of whether we can or can't hold on to him and it probably won't be a financial thing. It will depend on the season we have and David has.' Forest have developed some outstanding midfield players to England's benefit in recent history. To Neil Webb and Nigel Clough could be added David Prutton. And there are more in the Nationwide hinterland...</p> <p> <strong> CHRIS LLEWELLYN</strong> </p> <p><strong> (Norwich) 20</strong> </p> <p> He had a major test last season when filling the gap left by striker Darren Eadie's move to Leicester - not the easiest job considering his comparative inexperience and Eadie's popularity with the fans. But Norwich's manager, Bryan Hamilton, enthuses: 'The mental strength he showed in coming through it was fantastic.' This element, combined with Llewellyn's athleticism and ability with either foot, causes Hamilton to suggest that there is 'definitely a top-class player in there'. But whether the Welsh under-21 player will continue to show it as a striker - like his fellow Welshman at Norwich, Craig Bellamy - is another matter. Hamilton has been using him recently as an attacking left back and says: 'I think that could be his best role.' </p> <p> <strong> PAUL IFILL</strong> </p> <p><strong> (Millwall) 20 </strong> Millwall insiders claim that, of their group of youngsters who have attracted the attention of First Division and Premiership scouts over the past 12 months - Neil Harris, Tim Cahill, Richard Sadlier and Ifill - it is Ifill who has been the subject of the most inquiries. Although he joined Millwall as a striker it is in a wide-right role that this six-footer has established himself in the first team, and emerged as such a prominent eye-catcher. 'He is an exciting player, isn't he?' says Millwall's co-manager, Keith Stevens. 'He has a lot of pace and he does so much off the cuff - I am not sure that even we know what he is doing on the ball sometimes.' </p> <p> <strong> JAMES O'CONNOR</strong> </p> <p><strong> (Stoke) 20</strong> </p> <p> The Dublin-born O'Connor, an Irish Republic under-21 star, is the archetypal little red-headed midfield dynamo. Last season was his first as a regular first-team player, but his high-octane impact was such that Stoke have already found it necessary to reassure their fans that he will be remaining at the club. Stoke's coach, Nigel Pearson, says that he finds O'Connor's work rate 'phenomenal'. At this stage of the player's development, the downside is that his enthusiasm can lead him into trying to do too much; and, because of his love of a hard tackle, incurring the displeasure of referees is inevitably another problem. 'But he is learning,' Pearson reminds us. 'It seems difficult to believe that he has become so important to us in such a short space of time. The fact is, he is a winner.' </p> <p> <strong> TOMMY MILLER</strong> </p> <p> <strong> (Hartlepool) 21</strong> </p> <p> When manager Chris Turner started working with the tall midfielder 17 months ago, he encouraged him to make more runs beyond his strikers. The result is that Miller, whose football education at Hartlepool has included the experience of playing alongside Peter Beardsley, scored as many as 16 goals last season. Turner acknowledges that this will be an even more important season for him ('He has to show that he is not a one-season wonder') and, indeed, that he will soon need to move out of the Third Division in order to make further progress. But he has no doubts that Miller would look comfortable in a First Division or Premiership squad. 'Apart from his ability, he looks after himself correctly. He is a model pro.' </p> <p> <strong> IAN STONEBRIDGE</strong> </p> <p> <strong> (Plymouth) 18</strong> </p> <p> It is not unusual for players to get to the top after being rejected at this level at the start of their careers, and Plymouth suggest this could be the case with the Taunton-born Stonebridge. He joined them at the start of last season, via a spell on the books of Tottenham, and did well enough - until hit by a groin injury - to gain selection for England's under-18 team. Plymouth's assistant-manager, Steve McCall, says: 'He probably needs to get a little bit quicker but the great thing about him is his eye for goals. Because of his positioning, alertness and touch, he is magnificent at our level, and this should give him the confidence to keep progressing.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>For every fan and every player, for a host of differing reasons, every season is a big season. And while the marketing of a Premiership still cranking up for yet more razzmatazz may already be cloying, a little more hyperbole than usual from the clubs of the Nationwide League's First Division is forgivable this time around. Quite probably the 46-game grueller that starts on Saturday is indeed the biggest one yet. </p> <p>Picture this. Next summer, the Premiership's new cable, satellite, digital and coming-out-of-your-ears television deal kicks in, at a premium to the elite of some \u00a315 million a year each. Div One chairmen's eyes light up, agents scour the team-sheets for players to recruit and bank managers book holidays in Barbados. Promotion will matter as never before. </p> <p>If not of razor-sharp quality, already we know the First Division competition to be cut-throat keen. From this early vantage point, at least a dozen biggish clubs will be vying for the three plum positions. The fascination will be twofold; watching them take points off one another, the balance of power shifting weekly until the spring scramble, and seeing which are willing to speculate in the winter to accumulate come the summer. </p> <p>'Massive,' is how the Nottingham Forest manager, David Platt, his club one of those desperate dozen, views the season. 'A lot of clubs will be saying, \"We have got to be in the Premiership\", and will be putting their necks on the line financially. That's the feeling here. We're at a level where if we don't go up, we will have to trim things.' </p> <p>The First Division is a different world, he concedes. 'You find that out just making an enquiry about a reserve player in the Premiership. Ask about his salary and it blows your mind what he is on. That's where you notice most how big the gap is.' </p> <p>In quality, too, he admits. 'There's a mixture. The majority of clubs want to play football. But I don't think there are many exceptional strikers, who would score goals in the Premiership, though there are quite a few who will at this level. Because of that, you can afford to go at teams. You don't get punished as much for mistakes in Division One. </p> <p>'There's not so much of a divide here, though. In this league, you will get beaten by teams you don't expect. It's not often that Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea lose to sides you expect them to beat. The top of the pools coupon is more predictable these days. I think that's why this division will be interesting. There's a depth of competition.' </p> <p>He expects, naturally, the moneyed clubs to be the main rivals; Blackburn and Fulham. And, a little surprisingly, relegated Sheffield Wednesday, 'because they've got quality players they probably won't be able to sell even if they want to because of the wages they're on'. And Huddersfield, and Wolves 'depending on who they get to replace Ade Akinbiyi'. And Watford and Birmingham City, and ... the list goes on. </p> <p>Platt is aware that it is a big season for him, too. He is a man with a high reputation, having captained England and played for Juventus, Sampdoria and Arsenal. He needs success to satisfy his personal drive. He also nurtures ambitions one day to manage the national team, having already worked as an assistant to Howard Wilkinson with the under-18 team as part of his nine months learning the coaching trade.

      "bodyText": "For every fan and every player, for a host of differing reasons, every season is a big season. And while the marketing of a Premiership still cranking up for yet more razzmatazz may already be cloying, a little more hyperbole than usual from the clubs of the Nationwide League's First Division is forgivable this time around. Quite probably the 46-game grueller that starts on Saturday is indeed the biggest one yet. Picture this. Next summer, the Premiership's new cable, satellite, digital and coming-out-of-your-ears television deal kicks in, at a premium to the elite of some \u00a315 million a year each. Div One chairmen's eyes light up, agents scour the team-sheets for players to recruit and bank managers book holidays in Barbados. Promotion will matter as never before. If not of razor-sharp quality, already we know the First Division competition to be cut-throat keen. From this early vantage point, at least a dozen biggish clubs will be vying for the three plum positions. The fascination will be twofold; watching them take points off one another, the balance of power shifting weekly until the spring scramble, and seeing which are willing to speculate in the winter to accumulate come the summer. 'Massive,' is how the Nottingham Forest manager, David Platt, his club one of those desperate dozen, views the season. 'A lot of clubs will be saying, \"We have got to be in the Premiership\", and will be putting their necks on the line financially. That's the feeling here. We're at a level where if we don't go up, we will have to trim things.' The First Division is a different world, he concedes. 'You find that out just making an enquiry about a reserve player in the Premiership. Ask about his salary and it blows your mind what he is on. That's where you notice most how big the gap is.' In quality, too, he admits. 'There's a mixture. The majority of clubs want to play football. But I don't think there are many exceptional strikers, who would score goals in the Premiership, though there are quite a few who will at this level. Because of that, you can afford to go at teams. You don't get punished as much for mistakes in Division One. 'There's not so much of a divide here, though. In this league, you will get beaten by teams you don't expect. It's not often that Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea lose to sides you expect them to beat. The top of the pools coupon is more predictable these days. I think that's why this division will be interesting. There's a depth of competition.' He expects, naturally, the moneyed clubs to be the main rivals; Blackburn and Fulham. And, a little surprisingly, relegated Sheffield Wednesday, 'because they've got quality players they probably won't be able to sell even if they want to because of the wages they're on'. And Huddersfield, and Wolves 'depending on who they get to replace Ade Akinbiyi'. And Watford and Birmingham City, and ... the list goes on. Platt is aware that it is a big season for him, too. He is a man with a high reputation, having captained England and played for Juventus, Sampdoria and Arsenal. He needs success to satisfy his personal drive. He also nurtures ambitions one day to manage the national team, having already worked as an assistant to Howard Wilkinson with the under-18 team as part of his nine months learning the coaching trade. During that period, he also visited Lazio and Juve and observed Louis Van Gaal's enlightening sessions at Barcelona. A few months in charge of Sampdoria, his first managerial position, when he cut his losses amid opposition from the Italian managers' association because he did not possess the Uefa B coaching licence (since obtained), does not appear to have damaged him. Another season of treading water with Forest, similar to the last after relegation, and doubts about his capabilities will surface, however. 'It's never really worried me,' he says. 'But I'm under no illusions about the importance of doing well. I don't need this financially but I do need the success. I've not gone into management to pass my time away.

I remember the time he was playing for Scotland against England and taunted the English by playing keepy-uppy. </p> <p>We snapped him up while he was working as a miner in Fife: many of the Rovers players came from mining backgrounds. Becoming a footballer was seen as a way out of the mines. I think that's why so many players, and also managers such as Jock Stein and Bill Shankly, came from mining areas like Lanarkshire and Ayrshire. </p> <p> When Baxter left us after three seasons for Rangers, people complained that the transfer fee ( \u00a320,000) was a disgrace, that he'd been sold far too cheaply. It was said that Baxter left Rovers because he'd had a fight with the chairman's wife - as if Raith Rovers could have held onto a player of his special talent for another few years! </p> <p> Sadly Raith have never had as much success as I'd like.

The match was played at Ibrox - I'm sure Rangers helped us by flooding the pitch or something! The tragedy for me was that I had to do a television interview in London that morning and my plane to Glasgow afterwards was cancelled: I had to listen to the radio commentary on the match being played down a friend's phone. We won 6-5 on penalties after a 2-2 draw. It's still the only major trophy Raith have won. </p> <p> We then drew Bayern Munich in the Uefa Cup and at half-time in the second leg over there the scoreboard carried the immortal scoreline: Bayern Munich 0 Raith Rovers 1.

So I'm not very popular in some parts of my constituency because I support Raith.</p> <p> Of course there are many more glamorous clubs that have huge amounts of money and watching them on television is very enjoyable.

Official accounts for the doomed campaign reveal for the first time the full extent of how England spent the \u00a310 million given to them to 'bring football home'. In the end, though, just two of the 24 football dignitaries they were trying to impress actually backed England. The confidential accounts, which have been passed to The Observer, show that \u00a3288,425 was spent last year alone on 'ambassadors/VIPs/hospitality'. That included the efforts of football legends turned 2006 frontmen Sir Bobby Charlton, Sir Geoff Hurst and Gary Lineker to bring the World Cup 'home to England', their still-undisclosed fees for helping the \u00a310m bid, and both hospitality and undisclosed gifts for the game's decision-makers. A total of \u00a3623,686 went into advertising the bid, \u00a3361,914 on visits abroad, \u00a3646,251 into the 1,000-page bid document and a further \u00a3506,570 on other publications during 1999. More than \u00a3100,000 was spent trying to impress visiting inspectors from Fifa, football's world governing body, with five-star hotels and helicopter trips. The accounts, which detail how \u00a34.18m was spent last year, will be seized upon by critics who doubted the wisdom of mounting the 2006 bid from the outset. Labour MP Derek Wyatt, who has tabled parliamentary questions about how the \u00a310m was used, said the figures were 'extraordinary. Ten million pounds is a huge amount of money to spend and only get two votes. Last year's \u00a34.18m strikes me as excessive. In retrospect the bid does seem to have been totally misguided and extraordinarily expensive.' Wyatt said disclosure of the 2006 accounts made it much more likely that the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, which he belongs to, would now investigate the whole \u00a310m budget as part of a planned inquiry this autumn into Britain's troubled recent record of funding major sports projects. The 2005 World Athletics Championships in London, the \u00a3475m revamp of Wembley Stadium and the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, which needed a \u00a312m Treasury handout last month to stay afloat, will also be examined. MPs may order the release of information to obtain full details of where the entire \u00a310m went, not just the \u00a33.1m lottery grant provided by Sport England, which was spent solely on staff salaries and administration. The Football Association and the Premier League each gave another \u00a33m. MPs could demand to know, for example, exactly how much Charlton and Hurst, who have both been knighted for their services to football, were paid for their four years' work. The document, written in April, illustrates the misplaced optimism that fuelled England's bid, which critics described as naive, arrogant and misguided, especially as it was not backed by European football's ruling body. Under the heading 'travel and subsistence', bid director Alec McGivan explains spending \u00a3361,914 on overseas visits by saying: 'During 1999 the campaign team visited 20 countries (some more than once) and travelled nearly 150,000 miles. The policy of seeing members of the Fifa executive committee in their own countries has proved to be the right one and has paid dividends.' Three months later events proved McGivan spectacularly wrong when only two Fifa executive committee members, both Scots, endorsed England's bid. One of those was New Zealand's Glasgow-born representative Charlie Dempsey, who effectively handed Germany the tournament 12-11 ahead of favourites South Africa when he abstained after England's early exit. The accounts also show that much of the Premier League's \u00a33m donation went straight back into their pockets because the 2006 team invested heavily on advertising on pitch-side hoardings at Premiership grounds. They spent \u00a3400,000 on those in the 1998-99 season, followed by another \u00a3340,000 between August and December 1999. Another \u00a3426,569 was spent last year on 'events/exhibitions', such as attending football trade fairs in Cannes and Los Angeles. Their German and South African rivals, both of whom spent far less than England, claimed that McGivan's team usually turned up at such events with bigger delegations than them, and put the largest amount of effort into rolling out the red carpet for Fifa bigwigs. Two-thirds of the Fifa 24 and their partners enjoyed a four-day visit to London around the 1999 FA Cup Final. When five Fifa inspectors arrived last autumn, helicopters from the Royal Squadron carried them around. FA sources say that 'full disclosure' of the \u00a310m budget is planned.",

      "body": "<p>David Moyes is nothing if not thorough. Preston North End's determined and ambitious young manager was still dissecting Monday evening's 5-0 thrashing by Everton at the training ground two days later, and a steward gravely passed on the information that our prearranged interview might have to wait. 'It's still only half time. There's all the second half yet, and that's not counting all the pauses and replays.' </p> <p>This was only a pre-season friendly after all, and from all accounts Everton turned in an unexpectedly accomplished performance, but Moyes is the meticulous type. Either that or he enjoys the sound of his Glaswegian tones berating this first touch or that misplaced pass, and he certainly has no qualms about keeping journalists hanging around. All in all, it is not too difficult to work out why his unofficial nickname is Young Fergie. </p> <p>'I've heard that, but I don't know where people get it from,' Moyes said. 'The only similarity I can see is that we are both managers and we're both from Glasgow.' Get on the wrong side of Moyes, as one or two people have discovered, and there are further similarities with the tyrant of Old Trafford, but this is no time to be tactless. Moyes, who peppers his team talks liberally with motivational quotes from the Red Knight's autobiography, is one of Fergie's biggest fans. 'I think everybody is a fan of Sir Alex,' he said. 'He's had great success, he's achieved everything, and he's done it all by himself, starting at the bottom and working his way up.' </p> <p>Moyes, whose Preston side won the Second Division last season in only his second full season as coach, reckons he is lucky to be starting out on the managerial ladder a rung or two higher than where Ferguson's career began. North End is a solid, well-run club that ought to be able to find a niche for itself in Division One despite operating at lower levels for the past 20 years. 'The set-up here is First Division at least,' Moyes said. 'I'm not going to make any daft boasts, and I'm not going to use the word consolidation either, not at this stage of the season anyway. But the stadium, the club and the fan base are First-Division sized. I'm fairly confident we can make a go of it but we need to see how the players respond.' </p> <p>On the face of it Moyes should have few worries in that respect. It is precisely his ability to get the best out of his players, not to mention turning Preston from a long ball side to the most cultured passers in the Second Division, which has got him noticed. Already earmarked at the age of 37 as a manager to watch, Moyes has been linked with a couple of Premiership vacancies since Old Trafford's interest alerted everyone to the fact that Preston had a promising young coach. </p> <p> Moyes is reluctant to talk about why he never actually became Ferguson's assistant at United, though it is clear the episode was more than mere speculation and that somewhere along the line he was disappointed. He would have had a tough decision anyway, between being a manager in his own right or accepting a lesser role at a much bigger club, though given his reverence for the personality involved and the certainty that the chance to work with Ferguson will be gone in two or three years' time, one suspects he would not have needed too long to make up his mind. </p> <p>'There's no need to talk about what is in the past,' he said. 'I have won a championship since and I'm very proud of that, and there is plenty of potential. But speaking theoretically, if I had the chance of a job where I felt I could learn more, or learn faster, I'd take it.' </p> <p>To say Moyes is eager to learn would be understating the case considerably. He qualified as a coach at the age of 22, and has been on practically every FA or SFA course to have come along since. 'He's got coaching badges coming out of his ears,' as a local journalist put it. Moyes was involved in Euro 2000, assessing selected games for yet another SFA qualification and working alongside Roy Hodgson for Uefa. Had things turned out differently he might have been encountering Hodgson again this season, but instead it will be Graeme Souness, bringing Blackburn Rovers to Deepdale for one of several keenly anticipated local derbies. With Preston, Blackburn, Bolton and Burnley all reunited in the First Division once again, it should be just like old times in Lancashire. </p> <p>Moyes rates Blackburn as the team most likely to succeed, simply because, like Fulham, they have money to spend mid-season. Bolton, as Sam Allardyce has frankly admitted, are in a healthy financial situation following the sale of Eidur Gudjohnsen and Claus Jensen, but are not as strong a side as last season. Money is tighter at Burnley and Preston, though having spent an unprecedented \u00a3850,000 already this summer, Moyes claims there is a modest amount at his disposal should things start to go badly wrong. </p> <p>'We've not got millions, but we have a board who are young, bright and helpful,' Moyes said. 'That's why this club is gradually moving in the right direction. It might have taken a while for us to get back into Division One, but I'd like to think it will be a while before we go back down again. Playing at this level is what Preston supporters want and deserve. I can't wait for the atmosphere at all those derbies. Many fans have been brought up on lower league football and half-empty grounds. Only the old timers can remember this club in the old First Division, but you would have to be into your thirties to even remember us in Division Two.' </p> <p>The nerve-centre of Preston's climb back into the relative big time has to be seen to be believed. Moyes's 'office' is just a desk, a diary and a telephone shoved into a corner of what is already a very small changing room. 'I'm a coach, my place of work is on the training field,' he explained. 'I try to give myself as little office work as possible, as you can probably tell.' </p> <p>On the same training field, as recently as six years ago, Moyes the Preston player laboured under John Beck's uncomplicated and uncompromising regime. Kick it long, coaching badges coming out of your ears or not. Surprisingly he is not bitter. 'Some of John's ideas were not easy for me to accept, but it was a great learning curve, and I must admit I'm still using some of his drills,' Moyes said. 'That's the nature of football. There's no right or wrong, no good or bad, you just take out what works for you and leave the rest. I like it when people say Preston play attractive football, but I don't kid myself I wouldn't be just as happy with a scruffy game and three points. You play for a result and that's all there is to it. It's a matter of using your players as effectively as possible. That's what coaching is all about.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "David Moyes is nothing if not thorough. Preston North End's determined and ambitious young manager was still dissecting Monday evening's 5-0 thrashing by Everton at the training ground two days later, and a steward gravely passed on the information that our prearranged interview might have to wait. 'It's still only half time. There's all the second half yet, and that's not counting all the pauses and replays.' This was only a pre-season friendly after all, and from all accounts Everton turned in an unexpectedly accomplished performance, but Moyes is the meticulous type. Either that or he enjoys the sound of his Glaswegian tones berating this first touch or that misplaced pass, and he certainly has no qualms about keeping journalists hanging around. All in all, it is not too difficult to work out why his unofficial nickname is Young Fergie. 'I've heard that, but I don't know where people get it from,' Moyes said. 'The only similarity I can see is that we are both managers and we're both from Glasgow.' Get on the wrong side of Moyes, as one or two people have discovered, and there are further similarities with the tyrant of Old Trafford, but this is no time to be tactless. Moyes, who peppers his team talks liberally with motivational quotes from the Red Knight's autobiography, is one of Fergie's biggest fans. 'I think everybody is a fan of Sir Alex,' he said. 'He's had great success, he's achieved everything, and he's done it all by himself, starting at the bottom and working his way up.' Moyes, whose Preston side won the Second Division last season in only his second full season as coach, reckons he is lucky to be starting out on the managerial ladder a rung or two higher than where Ferguson's career began. North End is a solid, well-run club that ought to be able to find a niche for itself in Division One despite operating at lower levels for the past 20 years. 'The set-up here is First Division at least,' Moyes said. 'I'm not going to make any daft boasts, and I'm not going to use the word consolidation either, not at this stage of the season anyway. But the stadium, the club and the fan base are First-Division sized. I'm fairly confident we can make a go of it but we need to see how the players respond.' On the face of it Moyes should have few worries in that respect. It is precisely his ability to get the best out of his players, not to mention turning Preston from a long ball side to the most cultured passers in the Second Division, which has got him noticed. Already earmarked at the age of 37 as a manager to watch, Moyes has been linked with a couple of Premiership vacancies since Old Trafford's interest alerted everyone to the fact that Preston had a promising young coach. Moyes is reluctant to talk about why he never actually became Ferguson's assistant at United, though it is clear the episode was more than mere speculation and that somewhere along the line he was disappointed. He would have had a tough decision anyway, between being a manager in his own right or accepting a lesser role at a much bigger club, though given his reverence for the personality involved and the certainty that the chance to work with Ferguson will be gone in two or three years' time, one suspects he would not have needed too long to make up his mind. 'There's no need to talk about what is in the past,' he said. 'I have won a championship since and I'm very proud of that, and there is plenty of potential. But speaking theoretically, if I had the chance of a job where I felt I could learn more, or learn faster, I'd take it.' To say Moyes is eager to learn would be understating the case considerably. He qualified as a coach at the age of 22, and has been on practically every FA or SFA course to have come along since. 'He's got coaching badges coming out of his ears,' as a local journalist put it. Moyes was involved in Euro 2000, assessing selected games for yet another SFA qualification and working alongside Roy Hodgson for Uefa. Had things turned out differently he might have been encountering Hodgson again this season, but instead it will be Graeme Souness, bringing Blackburn Rovers to Deepdale for one of several keenly anticipated local derbies. With Preston, Blackburn, Bolton and Burnley all reunited in the First Division once again, it should be just like old times in Lancashire. Moyes rates Blackburn as the team most likely to succeed, simply because, like Fulham, they have money to spend mid-season. Bolton, as Sam Allardyce has frankly admitted, are in a healthy financial situation following the sale of Eidur Gudjohnsen and Claus Jensen, but are not as strong a side as last season. Money is tighter at Burnley and Preston, though having spent an unprecedented \u00a3850,000 already this summer, Moyes claims there is a modest amount at his disposal should things start to go badly wrong. 'We've not got millions, but we have a board who are young, bright and helpful,' Moyes said. 'That's why this club is gradually moving in the right direction. It might have taken a while for us to get back into Division One, but I'd like to think it will be a while before we go back down again. Playing at this level is what Preston supporters want and deserve. I can't wait for the atmosphere at all those derbies. Many fans have been brought up on lower league football and half-empty grounds. Only the old timers can remember this club in the old First Division, but you would have to be into your thirties to even remember us in Division Two.' The nerve-centre of Preston's climb back into the relative big time has to be seen to be believed. Moyes's 'office' is just a desk, a diary and a telephone shoved into a corner of what is already a very small changing room. 'I'm a coach, my place of work is on the training field,' he explained. 'I try to give myself as little office work as possible, as you can probably tell.' On the same training field, as recently as six years ago, Moyes the Preston player laboured under John Beck's uncomplicated and uncompromising regime. Kick it long, coaching badges coming out of your ears or not. Surprisingly he is not bitter. 'Some of John's ideas were not easy for me to accept, but it was a great learning curve, and I must admit I'm still using some of his drills,' Moyes said. 'That's the nature of football. There's no right or wrong, no good or bad, you just take out what works for you and leave the rest. I like it when people say Preston play attractive football, but I don't kid myself I wouldn't be just as happy with a scruffy game and three points. You play for a result and that's all there is to it. It's a matter of using your players as effectively as possible. That's what coaching is all about.'",

      "body": "<p> The Reverend Myer S. Wesseh was once the slickest, coolest, middleweight boxing champion Monrovia had ever seen.</p> <p> We sit on the concrete porch of his home, looking out on the jumbled alleys of one of the Liberian capital's poorest quarters. He is trying to convince me that his grand-nephew should have followed him into the fight game. \"It's a great shame,\" he says, slapping a thin thigh for emphasis. \"But the young boy kept having this dream in which he saw himself playing football and scoring goals, lots of goals. It was God's way of showing him his destiny. And he had to follow that destiny. The 'young boy' was George Weah. </p> <p> The house where Wesseh still lives, and where a pre-pubescent Weah dreamt of footballing greatness, is a warren of interconnected rooms and corridors. It's in Claratown. Elsewhere Claratown might be called working-class but here, where only a fraction of men have jobs, the term is hardly appropriate.</p> <p> It's a battered mass of nailed planks and rusting corrugated iron split by narrow lanes full of mud in the rainy season and dust in the dry. The only way to distinguish Weah's house from those all around is to look for where the wooden walls stop and the concrete walls (built with the footballer's recent wealth) start. </p> <p>Not one building has a second floor. A few yards from where I am sitting five young men are playing draughts and arguing quietly. A pot of peanuts is boiling on a brazier. Some boys kick a ball against a wall. The rain has stopped. And then the thudding of ball on wall stops too. Everyone looks up. There is a sudden silence. Then every male under 35 starts to move towards the main street. And the whisper reaches the Reverend and I, sitting on the porch.</p> <p> George Weah (the first African to become a global football star, World, African and European footballer of the year 1995, winner of Serie A, captain of the recently victorious Liberian national side, multi-millionaire, Unicef ambassador) is coming home.</p> <p> Within seconds, preceded by a swarm of young boys, he strides easily into the small courtyard. He is wearing a black Tommy Hilfiger-style skull cap, shades, a black Versace T-shirt and belt, white slacks and open-toed brown leather mules. On one wrist he has a gold chain and a set of cheap beads, on the other an expensive-looking but unshowy watch. He wears two plain silver rings on one finger and is slimmer and slighter and more youthful looking than I had expected. He moves with the languor of the very fit and the very rich and eases himself into a chair next to me (it's the only one available), nods hello and shakes hands courteously if with enough limpness to indicate our relative stations in life.</p> <p> The porch fills rapidly with relatives, neighbours, passers-by, fans, goggling children, old friends. The crowd is five deep outside and stretches down the lane to where he has parked his Porsche Boxster - registration '4 Me Only'. </p> <p> Weah, without getting up, shakes hands with his relatives. He takes off the Versace shades. There is a pause and no one seems entirely sure what to do or say. I'm feeling embarrassed that he has come home to find journalists talking to his relatives so I apologise. He lifts a finger and almost imperceptibly shakes his head to indicate my explanation is unnecessary. </p> <p> There is another pause so I ask if he is pleased to be home. He nods very slightly. \"This was my life. These are my own people. I love being here.\"</p> <p> There are at least 70 people watching us now. At my back ranks of faces are pressed against the chicken wire. They are silent with reverence. Further away, however, others are singing and someone is blowing a whistle repeatedly. A large lady in a hat has sat almost on my lap and I am writing my shorthand on a damp notepad balanced on her right thigh. More people squeeze onto the porch. A chicken, trapped and worried by the press of people, is pecking my shoe and the sweat is coursing down my back. Though he still looks impossibly relaxed I am ridiculously happy to see that drops are forming on Weah's forehead too and the Versace T-shirt is darkening with sweat. </p> <p> Later in the week he is scheduled to launch a Unicef (United Nations Children Fund) football tournament for children. The project is aimed at raising awareness of polio and HIV/Aids in Liberia. How important is his work for charity to him? \"I come from a poor family. I do what I can.\" I point out that a lot of footballers don't. \"Different people have different priorities.\" Can football really help Liberia, or Africa? \"It speaks to a lot of people. It keeps them off the street ...\" Another pause. </p> <p> A gap-toothed woman wearing an ancient Hard Rock cafe T-shirt and a fantastically dirty towel on her head shoulders her way forward and embraces Weah. She is followed by what can only be described as an ancient crone with wrinkled dugs who pinches Weah's cheek, wags a finger and squeezes the remnants of her right breast. Though I can't follow her English it is clear what she means: \"I remember when I used to suckle you and you were so high ...\". For a moment Weah looks like an embarrassed seven-year-old. </p> <p> \"She was my grandmother's best friend,\" he explains. \"These are all my aunts. They always wanted to beat me when I kicked balls into their houses on the street. We had real respect instilled in us. Real respect for our elders. I have come a long way from here. Football has been good to me. Everyone has their destiny but you have to make use of the opportunities. I have spent 15 years at the top of my game. It makes me happy. I love the game. I love scoring goals. But I have always taken it seriously. It is not what the game gives you, it is what you give it. It is what you choose. You've got to work hard and make things happen.\"</p> <p> Weah speaks quietly, fluently and unemotionally. It is clear that this is a medley of the phrases he has repeated in a thousand interviews. He doesn't even ask for the questions.</p> <p> A few days later I see him sitting in his room at the hotel (his own in fact) that the national side use as a base when in Liberia. The room is full of money men, agents, hangers-on, women, all looking for a piece of George Weah. But the great man has stretched his long frame out in an armchair with a walkman and a stack of hip-hop CDs and is just watching them with the same detached, courteous superiority that I saw on the porch in Claratown.</p> <p> Only three times in the week we spent in Liberia do I see him so much as raise his voice. </p> <p>Once in the changing room before the Cape Verde game, once when his squad turn up late for training and once when I ask him, sitting on the porch of the house he grew up in, if he has always felt that people have believed in him. Then suddenly, unexpectedly, his voice is black.</p> <p> \"When I left Liberia everyone said I would be wasting my time.\" He almost spits, almost snarls it. \"But they were wrong. I showed them they were wrong. I went to Cameroon and I dominated. I went to France and they doubted me and I dominated. I went to Italy and they said it was the hardest league in the world and I dominated there too.\"</p> <p> But then he pauses and reverts to his earlier deadpan softness.</p> <p> We spend a moment talking about the attractions of Chelsea Harbour where he has been living while playing at Stamford Bridge last season and I ask him what his plans are now and he refuses to tell me.</p> <p> Then he invites me to the Lone Stars training that afternoon. We talk about the Nigeria game and the African Nations Cup qualifier in three days time (Liberia have to win by two goals) and then his friend passes him a mobile and he grins as he shouts into it: \"Hey bro', how you doing? Been trying to get you but can't get through.\" I don't get to speak to him again. </p> <p>Liberia lies on what was once known as the 'slave coast' of Africa. From the seventeenth through to the mid-nineteenth century the tribes living in the thick tropical jungle of this part of the West African coast provided much of the forced labour required by Western Europe's new overseas colonies.</p> <p> With its malaria, yellow fever, cholera, snakes and hostile tribes, it was known in Europe as 'the white man's graveyard'. </p> <p> When the northern American states turned against the slave trade and people raised the idea of repatriating 'the blacks' to Africa it was to the slave coast they were sent.</p> <p> In 1822 a group of philanthropists and black activists organised the dispatch of 5,000 freed slaves back across the Atlantic to form a new state. It eventually became Liberia. </p> <p> The new immigrants quickly set about enslaving the indigenous people. They built their own plantation-style estates and even sold their captive labour force overseas. </p> <p>The villas they built in their new capital of Monrovia (named after President Monroe) even mimicked the houses of the owners from whom they'd escaped. They ruled over the local tribes, unchallenged, for more than a century. Their slave trade was still thriving in the 1930s.</p> <p> King George Oppong Weah was born in a small village outside Monrovia in 1966 into the Kru tribe. He had 12 brothers and sisters, long, strong legs but little else.</p> <p> His parents, following local custom, sent him to be raised by his grandmother in Monrovia itself. </p> <p> We arrived in the capital two days after the Lone Stars ( the national side ) had beaten the Nigerian Super Eagles 2-1 in a crucial World Cup qualifier. The win had been against all expectations.</p> <p> Monrovia had, we were told, gone wild. But by Tuesday the post-match euphoria had been washed away. It had been raining steadily since the game. The roads had been churned to red mud and stinking black; rubbish-strewn pools were everywhere.</p> <p> As we drove into Claratown a stream of people parted around us, their heads lowered against the downpour. Only the children looked at our car.</p> <p> The moment we mention Weah the atmosphere changes. People are delighted, smug, proud, welcoming, loud. Sampson Cole, 32, leads us proudly through the lanes towards the house where Weah grew up telling stories of kicking make-shift balls around with him 25 years before.</p> <p> Weah, tall for his age, started off as a goalkeeper before moving to the wing. \"He used to play with anything. Even a tin can\", Cole says. \"But he was good, so good.\"</p> <p> By his early teens Weah was playing semi-professionally. He would go to school, run back to play a match with his Claratown friends, then go on to train with his league team. He would come home at seven exhausted, day after day.</p> <p> Life wasn't easy. His grandmother would get up at 6am to start selling fish. When there wasn't enough food (and often there wasn't) Weah would be fed by his neighbours, the 'aunts'. He started playing for the local Claratown team. All afternoon, every afternoon. </p> <p> He wasn't an angel. Friends tell stories of drinking and smoking \" not just tobacco\" at the local 'Shaolin Temple', a kind of youth club-cum-bar-cum-pool hall.</p> <p> But his focus on football soon became complete. From 1981 to 1984 Weah played with Young Survivors. They were a fourth division side when he joined them, a second division side when he left.</p> <p> Parlee Dixon, who coached him in his first year with the club, told me it was immediately clear \"he was a genius\".</p> <p> In his first game for the side he scored two spectacular goals, one hit from such a tight angle that it went in-off having struck both posts. Weah clearly knew his own ability. \"He was always talking about the national team\", Dixon said. \"He was totally confident he would play for them.\"</p> <p> Weah was soon picked up by Bong Range United. He came on as a substitute and was, former teammates say, so psyched by his exclusion from the game that he seemed to score by sheer will.</p> <p> He was picked up by Mighty Barolle and then moved on to their arch-rivals Invincible Eleven where he was soon captain and top scorer. He was spotted by a scout for Tonerre de Yaounde of Cameroon and after a season there Claude Leroy, the Cameroon national coach, mentioned the young star to Arsene Wenger, then at Monaco.</p> <p> The story goes that Wenger flew down to Africa to watch the youngster and signed him on the spot for \u00a312,000. </p> <p> Wenger watched over his young charge carefully. Weah wasn't going to let him down. He watched his diet, slept well, didn't drink and didn't mess around. He stayed on after training to practise. Soon he had a regular place in the first team and when the goals started going in they didn't stop. </p> <p> Weah went on to Paris St.Germain and in the summer of 1995 put on the red and black of AC Milan. In his four years at the club Milan won back the Italian title, Weah scored one of the greatest individual goals in the history of the game (against Verona in 1996: an impossible waltz down the length of the pitch, beating seven players) and became the first player ever to be European, African and World player of the year in the same season.</p> <p> He had a stunning Jamaican-American wife, two kids, four homes on three continents and a ridiculous amount of money. The boy from Claratown had done what he had set out to do.</p> <p>Like Weah, John Jupilay is 34, though he looks 20 years older. His life has taken a rather different course. He was a trader in Monrovia until his leg was blown off by a mine in 1994 at the height of the civil war.</p> <p> We met him at a Unicef-sponsored prosthetic clinic in the forest by Liberia's northern border. \"I was out foraging for something to eat in the fields behind my house when there was a huge bang and I was thrown 10 feet through the air. I never felt anything. When I came round I was in hospital and my leg had gone. Then the pain began,\" he said, rocking back and forth gingerly on his new plastic limb watched by his physiotherapist.</p> <p> It had taken him a year to save up the money (about $3) needed for the journey from the capital. </p> <p> The Liberian civil war (fought between different ethnic factions aligned with different external powers) killed an estimated 150,000 people and left millions more homeless.</p> <p> Today the average life expectancy in Liberia is 55, 80 per cent of the 2.5 million people live below the poverty line and most of the country has no healthcare, no schools and no roads. Last month an acre or so of central Monrovia was connected to power lines. The rest of Liberia gets no electricity at all.</p> <p> It's a country that is so poor children rush out to pick up road kill and offer it for sale to passing traffic, so backward that when a child is savaged by a baboon local people launch a witch hunt to find the man who transformed himself into an ape to carry out the attack. </p> <p> The winner of the war was Charles Taylor, the leader of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia. He was elected President in 1995 by a populace so tired of war that they were happy to vote for him (the most brutal of the gunmen) if it brought peace.</p> <p> The war left other legacies. In Buchanan, 80 miles down the coast from Monrovia, we meet Curtis and Moses and Junior. They were among an estimated 15,000 child soldiers who fought with the rebels.</p> <p> The dozen boys we meet at another Unicef project, a rehabilitation centre, saw and took part in appalling atrocities. One watched his family burning to death as their home was torched. They will admit to killing people but they say it was in combat.</p> <p> In fact the rebels routinely massacred civilians, raped girls, tortured and executed prisoners. They employed the tactics of terror. Often the worst culprits were the younger troops. The rebels' Small Boys Units were infamous for their cruelty.</p> <p> In one corner sits a 13-year-old with no hands. They were amputated in Sierra Leone by the rebels there. He is playing draughts with his stumps. In Phebe hospital, deep in the heartland of Liberia, there are four stinking wards full of more children. A child a day dies. There are a dozen children who have the pinched, blank faces of the very weak. Their heads and bellies are huge, their limbs thin. There has been no emergency famine here. For 10 years there have simply been a lot of people in Liberia without enough to eat.</p> <p> Nearby is a three-year-old on a ventilator. It has been keeping him alive. But now there is no fuel for the generator so it lies useless. The boy pants frantically. The hospital administrator tells me the power will come on again in a few hours. He hopes the child won't die before then.</p> <p>Two days after the Nigeria game and three before they have to play Cape Verde, the Lone Stars gather for training in the national sports stadium.</p> <p> It is 3.30pm and Weah has been waiting for 90 minutes for all the squad to turn up. Last in is George Gebeo, a phenomenally talented 19-year-old currently playing in Greece. He arrives in a battered yellow taxi. It is raining again. Weah, appointed technical director of the Lone Stars by personal decree of the President, is a picture of suppressed fury.</p> <p> In his boots and strip he looks a lot older and a lot bigger than he did when we met him at home. Gathering the players in the centre of the pitch he starts to lay into them. \"What do you mean by coming so late?\" he asks. \"Some of you play in Europe. You wouldn't do that there. Why do you do it here when you are playing for your national side? I left my family's house to come here two hours ago to be here on time. Where is your respect?\" The players shift uneasily from foot to foot.</p> <p> Wearing the colours of a dozen of Europe's top teams and worth tens of millions of pounds between them they look out of place in the battered, bullet-scarred stadium with its weed-strewn, half cut grass. Christopher Wreh stands quietly in the yellow and blue of the Arsenal away strip. I wonder quite what their managers would think if could see their players now, on the scrubby grass, with their socks down, no shinpads, no physios, no trainers, no real coaches.</p> <p> Weah is almost apoplectic. You can see his barely contained anger in his every movement. It is clear he simply can't understand how other people don't want this as badly as he does. Because even at 34, with the best of his career behind him, Weah still wants it badly. </p> <p> They huddle for a short prayer and then start to train. For 40 minutes they dribble round cones and do short passing exercises.</p> <p> The mood is listless, almost sullen. Then they start a nine-a-side game. And they start to smile and run and show off and do tricks. Weah has said that they should only be giving 75 per cent but within 30 minutes the trainer has been on the pitch three times to deal with the aftermath of bone-crunching tackles. </p> <p> Behind me the 200 or so spectators watching the training start to shout. Weah has the ball by the corner flag. He has beaten one man with a casual flick of his right boot and now sends a perfect cross swerving across the mouth of the goal. The subs by the bench start listing the African players who have made it in Europe, swapping their $20 a month local salaries for the megabucks of modern Western football.</p> <p> They talk about the Nigerians Nwankwo Kanu and Celestine Babayaro, who play at Arsenal and Chelsea for approaching \u00a340,000 a week, and Shaun Bartlett, the South African currently playing in Switzerland and valued at \u00a34m.</p> <p> Listening is Napoleon Japloe, the technical director of the Liberian FA. We talk about Fifa's decision to deny South Africa the 2006 World Cup and the future of African football. \"It doesn't matter where they hold it, an African side will win it soon. It's inevitable. They can't keep us out forever,\" he says. He says that Weah's success - like that of other African stars in their own countries - has revolutionised the game in Liberia. \"It is now a profession here. It is something that you can work at. You can get into it and make yourself a future, money, a life. It is respected now.\"</p> <p> I briefly sketch what to me is a dystopic vision of African football where season tickets cost \u00a31,000, players cost the same as a small country's national budget and the current innocence and enthusiasm for the sport is gone. (This is not idle speculation. Luis Figo cost Real Madrid around \u00a340m, almost exactly the Liberian government's annual expenditure.) \"I'd love to see that,\" he says. \"That is our dream.\"</p> <p>On Saturday the rain had cleared. The news was full of heavy fighting against insurgents in the north of the country (up towards the hospital we visited early in the week) and presidential engagements. And, of course, the afternoon's Cape Verde game. </p> <p> When they had travelled to Praia, the Lone Stars had been beaten 2-0. Now, to qualify for the Africa Cup, they needed to win by two goals at home.</p> <p> From early in the morning the crowds had been heading out to the stadium. They walked, packed taxis, swarmed over lorries. At the ground those with tickets mass in thick crowds. Those without scale the ramshackle fence around the stadium compound and set out across the overgrown concrete at a sprint.</p> <p> In between the fence and the stadium are hundreds of police and soldiers armed with whatever they could lay their hands on - guns, batons, bits of wood, their own heavy belts. Their task is to catch those streaming across the fence and they are not particular about how they do it.</p> <p> Those caught get an appalling beating. \"Pain is the only language these people understand,\" said one fat, heavily sweating police officer. Inside the stadium the atmosphere is very different. Even the witchdoctors on the touchline are happy.</p> <p> Below, deep inside the grandstand, Weah is psyching up his team. He tells them what they have to do, why they have to do it and that they can do it. And then they gather in a huddle for a short, fervent prayer. Which appears to have been heard. After only three minutes Weah smashes the ball into the Cape Verde net. A second goal straight after half-time takes the Lone Stars through to the next round of the Africa Cup - and the crowd close to hysteria.</p> <p> Weah scores again after 77 minutes, and that seems to settle it. Then, in injury time, a penalty. If Cape Verde score they are through. For five seconds nowhere on the entire African continent is as quiet as that stadium. And Clayton saves it. Spreading to his left he palms the ball around a post.</p> <p> It's all over. The crowd go mad, streaming onto the pitch. The players are leaping on top of each other. Clayton is crying, the witchdoctors are waving all sorts of odd things in the air. And everyone is singing. And dancing. And singing. </p> <p> I think about a comment I'd heard a few days earlier in Claratown. Two young men were leaning against a shack 50 yards from Weah's home, drinking sangria and watching the crowds swarming around the great man. I stood around and started talking with them.

      "bodyText": "The Reverend Myer S. Wesseh was once the slickest, coolest, middleweight boxing champion Monrovia had ever seen. We sit on the concrete porch of his home, looking out on the jumbled alleys of one of the Liberian capital's poorest quarters. He is trying to convince me that his grand-nephew should have followed him into the fight game. \"It's a great shame,\" he says, slapping a thin thigh for emphasis. \"But the young boy kept having this dream in which he saw himself playing football and scoring goals, lots of goals. It was God's way of showing him his destiny. And he had to follow that destiny. The 'young boy' was George Weah. The house where Wesseh still lives, and where a pre-pubescent Weah dreamt of footballing greatness, is a warren of interconnected rooms and corridors. It's in Claratown. Elsewhere Claratown might be called working-class but here, where only a fraction of men have jobs, the term is hardly appropriate. It's a battered mass of nailed planks and rusting corrugated iron split by narrow lanes full of mud in the rainy season and dust in the dry. The only way to distinguish Weah's house from those all around is to look for where the wooden walls stop and the concrete walls (built with the footballer's recent wealth) start. Not one building has a second floor. A few yards from where I am sitting five young men are playing draughts and arguing quietly. A pot of peanuts is boiling on a brazier. Some boys kick a ball against a wall. The rain has stopped. And then the thudding of ball on wall stops too. Everyone looks up. There is a sudden silence. Then every male under 35 starts to move towards the main street. And the whisper reaches the Reverend and I, sitting on the porch. George Weah (the first African to become a global football star, World, African and European footballer of the year 1995, winner of Serie A, captain of the recently victorious Liberian national side, multi-millionaire, Unicef ambassador) is coming home. Within seconds, preceded by a swarm of young boys, he strides easily into the small courtyard. He is wearing a black Tommy Hilfiger-style skull cap, shades, a black Versace T-shirt and belt, white slacks and open-toed brown leather mules. On one wrist he has a gold chain and a set of cheap beads, on the other an expensive-looking but unshowy watch. He wears two plain silver rings on one finger and is slimmer and slighter and more youthful looking than I had expected. He moves with the languor of the very fit and the very rich and eases himself into a chair next to me (it's the only one available), nods hello and shakes hands courteously if with enough limpness to indicate our relative stations in life. The porch fills rapidly with relatives, neighbours, passers-by, fans, goggling children, old friends. The crowd is five deep outside and stretches down the lane to where he has parked his Porsche Boxster - registration '4 Me Only'. Weah, without getting up, shakes hands with his relatives. He takes off the Versace shades. There is a pause and no one seems entirely sure what to do or say. I'm feeling embarrassed that he has come home to find journalists talking to his relatives so I apologise. He lifts a finger and almost imperceptibly shakes his head to indicate my explanation is unnecessary. There is another pause so I ask if he is pleased to be home. He nods very slightly. \"This was my life. These are my own people. I love being here.\" There are at least 70 people watching us now. At my back ranks of faces are pressed against the chicken wire. They are silent with reverence. Further away, however, others are singing and someone is blowing a whistle repeatedly. A large lady in a hat has sat almost on my lap and I am writing my shorthand on a damp notepad balanced on her right thigh. More people squeeze onto the porch. A chicken, trapped and worried by the press of people, is pecking my shoe and the sweat is coursing down my back. Though he still looks impossibly relaxed I am ridiculously happy to see that drops are forming on Weah's forehead too and the Versace T-shirt is darkening with sweat. Later in the week he is scheduled to launch a Unicef (United Nations Children Fund) football tournament for children. The project is aimed at raising awareness of polio and HIV/Aids in Liberia. How important is his work for charity to him? \"I come from a poor family. I do what I can.\" I point out that a lot of footballers don't. \"Different people have different priorities.\" Can football really help Liberia, or Africa? \"It speaks to a lot of people. It keeps them off the street ...\" Another pause. A gap-toothed woman wearing an ancient Hard Rock cafe T-shirt and a fantastically dirty towel on her head shoulders her way forward and embraces Weah. She is followed by what can only be described as an ancient crone with wrinkled dugs who pinches Weah's cheek, wags a finger and squeezes the remnants of her right breast. Though I can't follow her English it is clear what she means: \"I remember when I used to suckle you and you were so high ...\". For a moment Weah looks like an embarrassed seven-year-old. \"She was my grandmother's best friend,\" he explains. \"These are all my aunts. They always wanted to beat me when I kicked balls into their houses on the street. We had real respect instilled in us. Real respect for our elders. I have come a long way from here. Football has been good to me. Everyone has their destiny but you have to make use of the opportunities. I have spent 15 years at the top of my game. It makes me happy. I love the game. I love scoring goals. But I have always taken it seriously. It is not what the game gives you, it is what you give it. It is what you choose. You've got to work hard and make things happen.\" Weah speaks quietly, fluently and unemotionally. It is clear that this is a medley of the phrases he has repeated in a thousand interviews. He doesn't even ask for the questions. A few days later I see him sitting in his room at the hotel (his own in fact) that the national side use as a base when in Liberia. The room is full of money men, agents, hangers-on, women, all looking for a piece of George Weah. But the great man has stretched his long frame out in an armchair with a walkman and a stack of hip-hop CDs and is just watching them with the same detached, courteous superiority that I saw on the porch in Claratown. Only three times in the week we spent in Liberia do I see him so much as raise his voice. Once in the changing room before the Cape Verde game, once when his squad turn up late for training and once when I ask him, sitting on the porch of the house he grew up in, if he has always felt that people have believed in him. Then suddenly, unexpectedly, his voice is black. \"When I left Liberia everyone said I would be wasting my time.\" He almost spits, almost snarls it. \"But they were wrong. I showed them they were wrong. I went to Cameroon and I dominated. I went to France and they doubted me and I dominated. I went to Italy and they said it was the hardest league in the world and I dominated there too.\" But then he pauses and reverts to his earlier deadpan softness. We spend a moment talking about the attractions of Chelsea Harbour where he has been living while playing at Stamford Bridge last season and I ask him what his plans are now and he refuses to tell me. Then he invites me to the Lone Stars training that afternoon. We talk about the Nigeria game and the African Nations Cup qualifier in three days time (Liberia have to win by two goals) and then his friend passes him a mobile and he grins as he shouts into it: \"Hey bro', how you doing? Been trying to get you but can't get through.\" I don't get to speak to him again. Liberia lies on what was once known as the 'slave coast' of Africa. From the seventeenth through to the mid-nineteenth century the tribes living in the thick tropical jungle of this part of the West African coast provided much of the forced labour required by Western Europe's new overseas colonies. With its malaria, yellow fever, cholera, snakes and hostile tribes, it was known in Europe as 'the white man's graveyard'. When the northern American states turned against the slave trade and people raised the idea of repatriating 'the blacks' to Africa it was to the slave coast they were sent. In 1822 a group of philanthropists and black activists organised the dispatch of 5,000 freed slaves back across the Atlantic to form a new state. It eventually became Liberia. The new immigrants quickly set about enslaving the indigenous people. They built their own plantation-style estates and even sold their captive labour force overseas. The villas they built in their new capital of Monrovia (named after President Monroe) even mimicked the houses of the owners from whom they'd escaped. They ruled over the local tribes, unchallenged, for more than a century. Their slave trade was still thriving in the 1930s. King George Oppong Weah was born in a small village outside Monrovia in 1966 into the Kru tribe. He had 12 brothers and sisters, long, strong legs but little else. His parents, following local custom, sent him to be raised by his grandmother in Monrovia itself. We arrived in the capital two days after the Lone Stars ( the national side ) had beaten the Nigerian Super Eagles 2-1 in a crucial World Cup qualifier. The win had been against all expectations. Monrovia had, we were told, gone wild. But by Tuesday the post-match euphoria had been washed away. It had been raining steadily since the game. The roads had been churned to red mud and stinking black; rubbish-strewn pools were everywhere. As we drove into Claratown a stream of people parted around us, their heads lowered against the downpour. Only the children looked at our car. The moment we mention Weah the atmosphere changes. People are delighted, smug, proud, welcoming, loud. Sampson Cole, 32, leads us proudly through the lanes towards the house where Weah grew up telling stories of kicking make-shift balls around with him 25 years before. Weah, tall for his age, started off as a goalkeeper before moving to the wing. \"He used to play with anything. Even a tin can\", Cole says. \"But he was good, so good.\" By his early teens Weah was playing semi-professionally. He would go to school, run back to play a match with his Claratown friends, then go on to train with his league team. He would come home at seven exhausted, day after day. Life wasn't easy. His grandmother would get up at 6am to start selling fish. When there wasn't enough food (and often there wasn't) Weah would be fed by his neighbours, the 'aunts'. He started playing for the local Claratown team. All afternoon, every afternoon. He wasn't an angel. Friends tell stories of drinking and smoking \" not just tobacco\" at the local 'Shaolin Temple', a kind of youth club-cum-bar-cum-pool hall. But his focus on football soon became complete. From 1981 to 1984 Weah played with Young Survivors. They were a fourth division side when he joined them, a second division side when he left. Parlee Dixon, who coached him in his first year with the club, told me it was immediately clear \"he was a genius\". In his first game for the side he scored two spectacular goals, one hit from such a tight angle that it went in-off having struck both posts. Weah clearly knew his own ability. \"He was always talking about the national team\", Dixon said. \"He was totally confident he would play for them.\" Weah was soon picked up by Bong Range United. He came on as a substitute and was, former teammates say, so psyched by his exclusion from the game that he seemed to score by sheer will. He was picked up by Mighty Barolle and then moved on to their arch-rivals Invincible Eleven where he was soon captain and top scorer. He was spotted by a scout for Tonerre de Yaounde of Cameroon and after a season there Claude Leroy, the Cameroon national coach, mentioned the young star to Arsene Wenger, then at Monaco. The story goes that Wenger flew down to Africa to watch the youngster and signed him on the spot for \u00a312,000. Wenger watched over his young charge carefully. Weah wasn't going to let him down. He watched his diet, slept well, didn't drink and didn't mess around. He stayed on after training to practise. Soon he had a regular place in the first team and when the goals started going in they didn't stop. Weah went on to Paris St.Germain and in the summer of 1995 put on the red and black of AC Milan. In his four years at the club Milan won back the Italian title, Weah scored one of the greatest individual goals in the history of the game (against Verona in 1996: an impossible waltz down the length of the pitch, beating seven players) and became the first player ever to be European, African and World player of the year in the same season. He had a stunning Jamaican-American wife, two kids, four homes on three continents and a ridiculous amount of money. The boy from Claratown had done what he had set out to do. Like Weah, John Jupilay is 34, though he looks 20 years older. His life has taken a rather different course. He was a trader in Monrovia until his leg was blown off by a mine in 1994 at the height of the civil war. We met him at a Unicef-sponsored prosthetic clinic in the forest by Liberia's northern border. \"I was out foraging for something to eat in the fields behind my house when there was a huge bang and I was thrown 10 feet through the air. I never felt anything. When I came round I was in hospital and my leg had gone. Then the pain began,\" he said, rocking back and forth gingerly on his new plastic limb watched by his physiotherapist. It had taken him a year to save up the money (about $3) needed for the journey from the capital. The Liberian civil war (fought between different ethnic factions aligned with different external powers) killed an estimated 150,000 people and left millions more homeless. Today the average life expectancy in Liberia is 55, 80 per cent of the 2.5 million people live below the poverty line and most of the country has no healthcare, no schools and no roads. Last month an acre or so of central Monrovia was connected to power lines. The rest of Liberia gets no electricity at all. It's a country that is so poor children rush out to pick up road kill and offer it for sale to passing traffic, so backward that when a child is savaged by a baboon local people launch a witch hunt to find the man who transformed himself into an ape to carry out the attack. The winner of the war was Charles Taylor, the leader of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia. He was elected President in 1995 by a populace so tired of war that they were happy to vote for him (the most brutal of the gunmen) if it brought peace. The war left other legacies. In Buchanan, 80 miles down the coast from Monrovia, we meet Curtis and Moses and Junior. They were among an estimated 15,000 child soldiers who fought with the rebels. The dozen boys we meet at another Unicef project, a rehabilitation centre, saw and took part in appalling atrocities. One watched his family burning to death as their home was torched. They will admit to killing people but they say it was in combat. In fact the rebels routinely massacred civilians, raped girls, tortured and executed prisoners. They employed the tactics of terror. Often the worst culprits were the younger troops. The rebels' Small Boys Units were infamous for their cruelty. In one corner sits a 13-year-old with no hands. They were amputated in Sierra Leone by the rebels there. He is playing draughts with his stumps. In Phebe hospital, deep in the heartland of Liberia, there are four stinking wards full of more children. A child a day dies. There are a dozen children who have the pinched, blank faces of the very weak. Their heads and bellies are huge, their limbs thin. There has been no emergency famine here. For 10 years there have simply been a lot of people in Liberia without enough to eat. Nearby is a three-year-old on a ventilator. It has been keeping him alive. But now there is no fuel for the generator so it lies useless. The boy pants frantically. The hospital administrator tells me the power will come on again in a few hours. He hopes the child won't die before then. Two days after the Nigeria game and three before they have to play Cape Verde, the Lone Stars gather for training in the national sports stadium. It is 3.30pm and Weah has been waiting for 90 minutes for all the squad to turn up. Last in is George Gebeo, a phenomenally talented 19-year-old currently playing in Greece. He arrives in a battered yellow taxi. It is raining again. Weah, appointed technical director of the Lone Stars by personal decree of the President, is a picture of suppressed fury. In his boots and strip he looks a lot older and a lot bigger than he did when we met him at home. Gathering the players in the centre of the pitch he starts to lay into them. \"What do you mean by coming so late?\" he asks. \"Some of you play in Europe. You wouldn't do that there. Why do you do it here when you are playing for your national side? I left my family's house to come here two hours ago to be here on time. Where is your respect?\" The players shift uneasily from foot to foot. Wearing the colours of a dozen of Europe's top teams and worth tens of millions of pounds between them they look out of place in the battered, bullet-scarred stadium with its weed-strewn, half cut grass. Christopher Wreh stands quietly in the yellow and blue of the Arsenal away strip. I wonder quite what their managers would think if could see their players now, on the scrubby grass, with their socks down, no shinpads, no physios, no trainers, no real coaches. Weah is almost apoplectic. You can see his barely contained anger in his every movement. It is clear he simply can't understand how other people don't want this as badly as he does. Because even at 34, with the best of his career behind him, Weah still wants it badly. They huddle for a short prayer and then start to train. For 40 minutes they dribble round cones and do short passing exercises. The mood is listless, almost sullen. Then they start a nine-a-side game. And they start to smile and run and show off and do tricks. Weah has said that they should only be giving 75 per cent but within 30 minutes the trainer has been on the pitch three times to deal with the aftermath of bone-crunching tackles. Behind me the 200 or so spectators watching the training start to shout. Weah has the ball by the corner flag. He has beaten one man with a casual flick of his right boot and now sends a perfect cross swerving across the mouth of the goal. The subs by the bench start listing the African players who have made it in Europe, swapping their $20 a month local salaries for the megabucks of modern Western football. They talk about the Nigerians Nwankwo Kanu and Celestine Babayaro, who play at Arsenal and Chelsea for approaching \u00a340,000 a week, and Shaun Bartlett, the South African currently playing in Switzerland and valued at \u00a34m. Listening is Napoleon Japloe, the technical director of the Liberian FA. We talk about Fifa's decision to deny South Africa the 2006 World Cup and the future of African football. \"It doesn't matter where they hold it, an African side will win it soon. It's inevitable. They can't keep us out forever,\" he says. He says that Weah's success - like that of other African stars in their own countries - has revolutionised the game in Liberia. \"It is now a profession here. It is something that you can work at. You can get into it and make yourself a future, money, a life. It is respected now.\" I briefly sketch what to me is a dystopic vision of African football where season tickets cost \u00a31,000, players cost the same as a small country's national budget and the current innocence and enthusiasm for the sport is gone. (This is not idle speculation. Luis Figo cost Real Madrid around \u00a340m, almost exactly the Liberian government's annual expenditure.) \"I'd love to see that,\" he says. \"That is our dream.\" On Saturday the rain had cleared. The news was full of heavy fighting against insurgents in the north of the country (up towards the hospital we visited early in the week) and presidential engagements. And, of course, the afternoon's Cape Verde game. When they had travelled to Praia, the Lone Stars had been beaten 2-0. Now, to qualify for the Africa Cup, they needed to win by two goals at home. From early in the morning the crowds had been heading out to the stadium. They walked, packed taxis, swarmed over lorries. At the ground those with tickets mass in thick crowds. Those without scale the ramshackle fence around the stadium compound and set out across the overgrown concrete at a sprint. In between the fence and the stadium are hundreds of police and soldiers armed with whatever they could lay their hands on - guns, batons, bits of wood, their own heavy belts. Their task is to catch those streaming across the fence and they are not particular about how they do it. Those caught get an appalling beating. \"Pain is the only language these people understand,\" said one fat, heavily sweating police officer. Inside the stadium the atmosphere is very different. Even the witchdoctors on the touchline are happy. Below, deep inside the grandstand, Weah is psyching up his team. He tells them what they have to do, why they have to do it and that they can do it. And then they gather in a huddle for a short, fervent prayer. Which appears to have been heard. After only three minutes Weah smashes the ball into the Cape Verde net. A second goal straight after half-time takes the Lone Stars through to the next round of the Africa Cup - and the crowd close to hysteria. Weah scores again after 77 minutes, and that seems to settle it. Then, in injury time, a penalty. If Cape Verde score they are through. For five seconds nowhere on the entire African continent is as quiet as that stadium. And Clayton saves it. Spreading to his left he palms the ball around a post. It's all over. The crowd go mad, streaming onto the pitch. The players are leaping on top of each other. Clayton is crying, the witchdoctors are waving all sorts of odd things in the air. And everyone is singing. And dancing. And singing. I think about a comment I'd heard a few days earlier in Claratown. Two young men were leaning against a shack 50 yards from Weah's home, drinking sangria and watching the crowds swarming around the great man. I stood around and started talking with them. They were brothers, both first division footballers and childhood friends of Weah. They weren't going to pay homage to a man they used to boot balls around with in the dirt streets they now stood in. Instead they waited until he came past on his way back to his Porsche. \"Manne,\" they called, using Weah's familiar tribal name, \"You gone forgotten us?\" Weah stopped and stepped over and gives them the local wide-boys' finger-clicking handshake. \"You playing these days?\" he asked. \"Sure are,\" they said and the three talked about their respective teams' prospects for a few moments. Then Weah's gone, back into the crowd, back into the \u00a340,000 car, back to stardom, multi-million pound endorsement deals, talk-show slots, ambassadorial roles for the UN, back in a different world, back on a different planet. They watch him go, followed by a pack of a hundred ragged kids. \"He's going to lead them all to the Promised Land,\" said the elder brother, Jackson, as he watched children push the Porsche through the mud and filth out onto the the main road. \"Man, tha's no problem,\" laughed his brother. \"There ain't nothing wrong with promises.\"",

      "body": "<p>On 3 September 1999, Barclays closed its branch in Wheathampstead, a small village of 5,000 people in rural Hertfordshire. After 62 years, the bank gave its customers two weeks' notice. It had been the last bank or building society in the village. </p> <p>At the time, Paul Barber, Barclays' director of communications, said: 'Customers are very important to us, and we don't want customers to leave.' But from being a village with a bank at its centre, the residents of Wheathampstead found themselves, almost overnight, in the 15 per cent of the population living furthest from a bank or building society branch. Almost a year later, Wheathampstead's former vicar, Tom Purchas, who took part in the demonstration against the closure, recalls Barclays departure 'as a sad day for the village'. </p> <p>Derek French, director of the Campaign for Community Banking Services, is a veteran of many such closure battles. He recalls the passion that the Wheathampstead closure provoked. 'There were people with white sticks, and young mothers pushing prams protesting,' he says. 'This is middle England, where most people have bank accounts, and where people are inconvenienced rather than disadvantaged by branch closures - though some quite badly.' As the first anniversary approaches, it is a departure many in the village are still coming to terms with. </p> <p>Dolly Smith, who lives in Wheathampstead, has been a Barclays customer since 1988. She was one of those outside the doors of the bank the day it closed despite being aged 80 and suffering from arthritis. Like many elderly residents of the village, she prefers face-to-face banking. 'The lady in Barclays was very nice, it was all very good, and then they went and closed it,' she says. </p> <p>'I don't think closing it is very good, but you have to carry on,' she adds. Dolly Smith has remained loyal to Barclays, though she now has to travel further afield.Banking now involves a 15-minute journey, rather than 'five minutes down the road', and, not having a car, she is reliant on others to take her. 'I get my brother-in-law to take me to Marshalswick,' she says. </p> <p>However, not all of Wheathampstead's Barclays customers have remained so loyal. Joanne Sandvoss, who works in the village store, left Barclays three or four months ago. She said: 'I didn't have time to get to Barclays branches in Harpenden or St Albans. I told Barclays the reasons, took all my money out, closed my account and opened one with the Post Office,' she says. And she has no regrets. 'The Girobank service is as good as Barclays was,' she says. </p> <p>Tracey Canfield, 24, who works in Hair Afayre in the village, is another affected by the closure. Before it closed, she says she used to go there a couple of times a week. Now, because of the hours she works, she finds it difficult to get to Barclays in Marshalswick before it closes. And for nights out she is dependant on the ATM in the village not running out of money. When it does: 'I have to travel to St Albans, or borrow money from my mum,' she says. </p> <p>Stephen Larkham, chairman of the Wheathampstead and District Preservation Society, says that since Barclays closure things have been tough. 'There has been a lot of anger,' he says. Larkham believes there is still a role for traditional banking in places such as Wheathampstead. 'There is a lot of hype surrounding telephone and internet banking, and a reaction against call centres and being put on hold, which drives people up the wall,' he says. </p> <p>However, Maureen Field is one resident who has embraced the new technology. 'I am on the internet with Barclays, and I find it okay,'she says. Now she only needs to visit a branch occasionally. 'I would only go to the bank to get a loan,' she says. </p> <p>Field's main concern is that the cash machine remains. 'If they took the machine away, it would be really dire,' she says. </p> <p>But while the alternatives offered by the banks do have some appeal, Larkham believes that in a place such as Wheathampstead, take-up is likely to be limited. </p> <p>'They are useful for a certain section of the village,' he says. 'But there is still a need to pay in cash and cheques, and you can't do that by internet or by phone.' </p> <p>One man unlikely to go online is Ronald Benson. Now in his 70s, he has been a Barclays customer since the end of the war. At the time of the closure he wrote to Barclays chief executive. 'Stupidly I took it quite personally,' he says. Benson says that he considered changing to another bank, but decided to stick with Barclays 'because there are no alternatives'. </p> <p>But rather than drawing money from the Barclays machine in the village, which he says 'doesn't appeal', or rely solely on the telephone to transfer money between accounts, he prefers to make the 15-minute drive to Welwyn every Monday to draw cash over the counter. </p> <p>So almost a year on, does Barclays have any regrets? According to a spokesperson: 'Barclays is committed to a branch network and to new technology.' He adds that while the bank appreciates the difficulties caused to some customers when branches close, Barclays can't afford to keep them open where they are not commercially viable. </p> <p>However, the spokesperson said that Barclays has finalised an arrangement allowing customers to pay in cash and cheques and to write cheques at any of the 15,500 Post Offices in England and Wales. </p> <p>'This has been well received, especially in rural communities where the branch has closed.' </p> <p>As to the long-term future of Barclays branch network: 'Wherever there is Barclays, there will be branches.' But how many will remain, and how many will go the way of Wheathampstead, Barclays is not prepared to say. </p> <p>'I can't tell what will happen tomorrow,' said the spokesperson.</p>",

Income drawdown schemes, products that allow you to defer buying an annuity and draw an income directly from your pension fund, are a solution to the problem for a some investors. Income drawdown is expensive, however: it's complicated and really only suits investors with large pension funds - those worth more than \u00a3250,000.",

One of the most important was a change in 1996 creating a new definition of the 'common bond' that must unite credit union members. </p> <p>This allowed unions to open to people living and working in one particular area, which allows for a more mixed membership, with varied income levels. It is hoped this will help the organisations to gain the power and credibility they have elsewhere in the world. In Ireland half the population are members of a credit union, compared with less than 1 per cent here, and in North America, according to credit union legend, even Steven Spielberg is a member. </p> <p>It is questionable whether credit unions will ever entirely fill the gap left by bank branch closures. But they would like to be seen as mainstream forms of financial provision, rather than a last resort for the poor. </p> <p>As mutual organisations, where profit is not the main criteria for success, the credit unions should have a head start over banks in becoming viable in areas where the big financial institutions have failed. </p> <p>The rates of interest they charge on borrowing can be no more than 1 per cent a month on the reducing balance, which works out at 12.68 per cent a year. You can borrow on a credit card for a fraction of this - but only if you can get a card. The more competitive card operators are generally choosy over the customers they take on, requiring high incomes and stable employment. </p> <p>Banks rarely lend personal loans of less than \u00a3500, which credit unions do, and at 12.68 per cent the rate is better than that available from most high street banks on loans up to about \u00a35,000. As credit union managers quickly point out, 12.68 per cent is a fraction of the 100 per cent plus interest loans that members would otherwise end up with if they went to a back-street lender. </p> <p>One aim of the credit unions is to encourage saving and most require members to have saved a set amount for 13 weeks before they can borrow. Savers receive dividends; the amount depends on the strength of the union but the maximum is 8 per cent. The Greater Manchester Police Force credit union lends at 8.65 per cent and for the last five years has paid 7 per cent on savings. </p> <p>Membership of credit unions is rising. In the past nine months, the Association of British Credit Unions Ltd (Abcul) has increased its membership by 26,000. Around 670 unions are now registered, representing 276,193 people, 20 per cent more than three years ago. </p> <p>The number of unions is not rising markedly but this is partly because there has been a number of mergers, which the credit union movement believes is a positive development. Larger unions are in a better position than small ones to offer the maximum range of services. </p> <p>Alongside the credit unions, quite literally in one case, a new type of financial institution is emerging. Last month in Portsmouth, in a building being shared with the fledgling Portsmouth Savers Credit Union, the Portsmouth Area Regeneration Trust (Part) opened for business lending to individuals and small businesses. A second such trust is due to open in Salford shortly and Karl Dayson, a research fellow at Salford University who helped to develop the model, says several more are in the pipeline. </p> <p>These trusts have been set up purely to lend, offering people virtually instant access to loans without paying sky-high rates of interest.

It has a formidable 26 per cent share of the market for toiletries and health and beauty products. Its profits have grown every year and, at \u00a3491.6 million for the year to last March, were almost five times higher than in 1988. </p> <p>So why have Boots' shares slumped from a high of 1070p at the end of 1998 to only 489.5p last Friday, making it one of the lowest-rated retailers? </p> <p>The answer is simple: the City is convinced that Boots is the next Marks &amp; Spencer. Only two years ago, M&amp;S's position as Britain's biggest clothing retailer seemed unassailable. Yet its customers have deserted for rivals such as Matalan and Next, its profits and margins have halved, its share price has withered to less than a third of its historic peak. Worse, there is no sign that it has worked out a strategy to return to glory. </p> <p>On the face of it, the comparison is reasonable. Just as M&amp;S was wounded by competition, so the City expects Boots to be hurt by supermarket groups such as Tesco and Asda, now part of the international empire of Wal-Mart. Both are determined to win a bigger share of their customers' spending, and both are targeting such areas as shampoos and skin creams, which are ripe for price competition. </p> <p>Almost everyone in Britain is within driving distance of a Boots or M&amp;S store, so there is little scope for raising sales by opening new ones. Both have been expanding internationally but not, so far, with huge success. </p> <p>Indeed, Boots is now re-examining its investment in the Netherlands, which it had hoped would be a bridgehead for continental expansion, while M&amp;S has pulled out of Canada, done badly in the US and has yet to convince the City that its investments in Europe will achieve a satisfactory return. </p> <p>There are signs that Boots is feeling the strain. According to government figures, the price of chemists' goods are now falling by around 2 per cent a year. Boots' sales mix is different from most rivals, and says its prices are still rising, but only by 0.5 per cent. That is hardly going to get profits soaring. </p> <p>Indeed, the rate of sales growth has been falling for three years and, judging by figures announced at last month's annual meeting, that drop is continuing. Margins last year were similar to those five years ago. Most analysts expect these, too, to fall. </p> <p>The result is steadily falling profit forecasts. Philip Dorgan of WestLB Panmure points out that, less than two years ago, most analysts expected Boots to make \u00a3745m profit for the year to next March. Now the consensus is closer to \u00a3600m, and it could fall further. </p> <p>That, however, says as much about analysts' abilities to predict the future as it does about Boots' business. More pertinent is that most analysts still expect Boots' profits to rise over the next three years. Contrast that with M&amp;S and Sainsbury, the other fallen retailing star, where, even in the year to March 2003 profits are expected to be below where they were in 1998. </p> <p>But the real difference is that M&amp;S and Sainsbury were taken by surprise when disaster struck, and were ill-prepared to cope. Boots, in contrast, is doing everything it can to make sure its sales and profits keep moving ahead. </p> <p>Boots does not publicly admit to a problem. Finance director David Thompson says he sees no reason why margins should fall and is confident that sales will keep growing. But the pace of new initiatives across the group suggests it is well aware of the threats to its core chemist chain. </p> <p>What really sets Boots apart from the fallen stars is the quality of its management. Both M&amp;S and Sainsbury had a history of paternalism. Sainsbury's chairman until 1988 was David Sainsbury, a scion of the founding family. Sir Richard Greenbury, M&amp;S chairman until last year, was the first person from outside the family to run the chain. Even then he had been there all his working life and did little to change its traditions. </p> <p>Most crucially, both companies initially refused to admit anything was wrong but, as crisis deepened, were forced to bring in new management from outside. </p> <p>At Boots, by contrast, the succession has been smooth. Lord Blyth, chairman since 1998 and chief executive for 11 years before that, retired last Monday and was replaced by Steve Russell, who has run the core retail chain since 1995. </p> <p>Ever churlish, the City even finds that a cause for complaint, asking whether Boots might have benefited from some new blood. </p> <p>There is, however, no sign that the management has run out of ideas. The company is testing an unprecedented number of initiatives to capitalise on the strength of Boots' name, one of the most trusted British brands. </p> <p>'We no longer think of Boots the Chemist in isolation,' said Thompson. 'We think of the brand and what it stands for.' It has been testing demand for dental services and based on the success of the six surgeries it has so far opened, is rolling them out nationally. There will be 50 by the end of the year, and up to 2,000 eventually. </p> <p>In two years' time, Boots estimates, these should each have sales of around \u00a31m and profits of \u00a3200,000. It is now testing health and beauty centres in its stores in London's Kensington High Street and Milton Keynes. These shops will offer services such as weight management, beauty treatments, physiotherapy, massage and aromatherapy. </p> <p>In the new year, it will open two independent sites, in north London and Northwich in Cheshire, to be called Boots Body 360. These will offer fitness studios, swimming pools, saunas and spas as well as beauty therapies. </p> <p>In September, it will launch a credit card based on its Advantage loyalty card, which will earn users points wherever it is used. On a smaller scale, it is opening nail bars in a number of branches, chiropody services in others. </p> <p>It has tested a Boots Men concept, offering things like shaving and grooming and, while the concept did not succeed in attracting enough male customers, it is a good way of getting women customers to buy more for their partners.

These will be available in Boots and in Harvey Nichols. </p> <p>The chain is also working on an internet service, which will be separate from its existing <a href=\"http://www.handbag.com\"> handbag.com</a>.

      "bodyText": "Sales at Boots the Chemist have risen by an average of 5.5 per cent a year over the last 12 years, and its margins have jumped from 5.3 per cent to 12.4 per cent, the third highest in retailing. It has a formidable 26 per cent share of the market for toiletries and health and beauty products. Its profits have grown every year and, at \u00a3491.6 million for the year to last March, were almost five times higher than in 1988. So why have Boots' shares slumped from a high of 1070p at the end of 1998 to only 489.5p last Friday, making it one of the lowest-rated retailers? The answer is simple: the City is convinced that Boots is the next Marks &amp; Spencer. Only two years ago, M&amp;S's position as Britain's biggest clothing retailer seemed unassailable. Yet its customers have deserted for rivals such as Matalan and Next, its profits and margins have halved, its share price has withered to less than a third of its historic peak. Worse, there is no sign that it has worked out a strategy to return to glory. On the face of it, the comparison is reasonable. Just as M&amp;S was wounded by competition, so the City expects Boots to be hurt by supermarket groups such as Tesco and Asda, now part of the international empire of Wal-Mart. Both are determined to win a bigger share of their customers' spending, and both are targeting such areas as shampoos and skin creams, which are ripe for price competition.

Only those students who have got to grips with the paperwork are likely to end up paying the right amount. So, unless you have completed a form P38(S) or a form P46 or seen a P45, you could benefit from reading this article. </p> <p>The basic situation is that, like all other UK residents under 65, you have a tax allowance of \u00a34,385 for the current tax year. If you earn less than that amount - equal to \u00a384.32 a week - you should not be taxed on it. But, in practice, the system does not work as smoothly as this. </p> <p>Jane Moore of the charity TaxAid says: 'The tax system is really designed for people who start work after school for one employer and do that same job until they retire.' </p> <p>To make sure tax is not deducted from your first pay packet, you have to prove to your employer you have not earned enough this tax year to bring you into the tax net. You can do this in three ways. </p> <p>If you have been working since the start of the tax year on 6 April, you need to get a P45 from your last employer. This will state how much you have earned. Your new employer will be able to calculate how much of your personal allowance of \u00a34,385 is still available to you. </p> <p>If, however, you have not been in the labour market this financial year, you can ask your employer to give you a form P46 to fill in. In signing this form you give your word that you have not worked since April. Alternatively, there is a special form for students, a P38(S), which you can sign if you are doing the job just for this vacation period and if you calculate that your earnings will fall under \u00a34,385. </p> <p>Tax specialist Paul Falvey of accountant Grant Thornton suspects many students end up out of pocket: 'I wouldn't be surprised if they lost out on a few hundred pounds this way. Big employers should be pretty well geared up, but small ones often aren't.' Many students and their advisers will assume that employers will automatically get the paperwork right. But the onus is on the individual to ensure they are not caught out. It will be far easier for many employers to deduct basic rate tax at 22 per cent and then leave it to the student to reclaim overpaid tax later. In the worst situation, a student could pay \u00a3964 in tax on earnings that should have been exempt. </p> <p>About 85 per cent of students work over the summer, according to research by NatWest. And about half of all students have a part-time job during term time. Since they graduate with an average debt of nearly \u00a35,300, accord ing to Barclays, they could find their annual tax payments are a crucial issue. </p> <p>The National Union of Students is concerned that students will fall into 'all sorts of pitfalls' over tax. For instance, the pay as you earn tax system - through which employers deduct tax at source for employees - functions poorly for people with two or more part-time jobs. It is extremely likely that a student earning less than \u00a34,385 from two different, but concurrent, part-time jobs will overpay tax and will need to reclaim. </p> <p>Another hideous tax situation is dealing with tax authorities abroad. If you are working outside the UK, get the tax situation sorted out in advance, says Falvey. 'It would be a nightmare to try to reclaim a few hundred pounds from the French authorities on a French tax form.' If, however, your French employer knows which forms you need, you may save yourself money. </p> <p>Students may feel tempted to avoid the tax system altogether if they are under the threshold. But they can easily get themselves into difficulties if a subsequent employer goes by the rule book. If a student is going through the system without getting P45s when they leave jobs, they will not be getting the benefit of any past tax deductions from their next employers. </p> <p>Reading University is typical of many students unions in not seeing the tax issue as particularly worrying. That may be because so few people understand the system. But, like many other students unions, it has a welfare advisory service that can offer basic advice on how to deal with employers and tax. </p> <p>If the worst happens, students who are taxed on earnings inside their personal allowance should be able to get a refund. The normal mechanism is to fill in a form P50 or contact the relevant tax office, which will need to be the one that deals with the affairs of the student's employer. The administration can, of course, assume nightmarish proportions for people hopping from job to job. If they can avoid it, students should keep out of the self-assessment tax return system. Moore says: 'If you ask for a tax return, you could find your fall into that system, never to emerge. They would keep sending you a return each year when you might not have to fill one out at all.' </p> <p>There may be some hope for bemused students, however.

      "bodyText": "In some parts of the country, credit unions are now beginning to take over premises deserted by the high street bank. In Salford, near Manchester, the River Valley Credit Union, moved into a former NatWest branch a year ago. Ann Falsey, chair of the River Valley Credit Union, believes the union's high street presence has helped to push membership up dramatically. At the time of the move, it had 225 active members and 90 child members (who can save with a credit union but cannot borrow). Now there are 800 active members and 400 juniors. Enquiries have increased again recently because the union has linked with Manchester General Hospital to let staff there have payments to the union transferred directly from wages. Falsey says there have been 200 enquiries, representing a little under 10 per cent of staff at the hospital. Membership also looks set to swell as a result of recent publicity on television.

      "body": "<p>Gerald Brenan wrote that a \"note of hunger\" sounds in Spanish literature from 17th-century picaresque novels to The Hive, Nobel prize-winner Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela's 1950s masterpiece. But Spain has been transformed in the last 50 years from a rural into an urban economy, from a dictatorship into bourgeois democracy, and from an unusual society in which factories and feudal estates, proletarians and serfs coexisted into one that is on the surface little different from any other modern European country. After these tumultuous social upheavals, hunger is no longer the dominant note of Spanish literature. </p> <p>Today, Spanish fiction ranges from the intellectual fireworks and hatred of oppression of Juan Goytisolo (profiled in next Saturday's Guardian) to the erotic panache of Almudena Grandes; from the psychological subtlety of Carmen Mart\u00edn Gaite to the bestselling thrillers of P\u00e9rez-Reverte. The 1970s transition from dictatorship meant censorship (and self-censorship) could be forgotten. New registers of irony, drama and psychology entered Spanish novels, which tackled with brio the taboos of the previous 40 years. A new readership was created too: nearly all the writers mentioned in this article, however literary, are big sellers. </p> <p>Spain's \"normalisation\" as a parliamentary democracy gave it something no other European country has: literature in four languages. Since the 1978 Constitution, Basque, Galician and Catalan, suppressed under Franco, are again taught in schools (they were always spoken in the home), and an audience has arisen for literature written in these languages. </p> <p>The best-known writer from the geographical periphery is the Basque Bernardo Atxaga. Born in 1951 in a village near San Sebastian, Atxaga tells how as a boy he accompanied his grandfather to collect electricity payments from the small hill farms. While his elders sipped wine, the child drank in the legends of the valley. Atxaga's great work, Obabakoak , exudes this oral tradition of the Basque countryside; its 27 interlinked stories recreate a world of winter evenings talking by the fireside. This may give the impression of a mythologising flight from the contemporary world into some lost and longed-for rural paradise, but there is no nostalgia in Atxaga; his stories are tough. The magical village of Obaba, which seems remote in history, is part of the modern world. His characters go abroad, speak foreign languages and drive cars to and from Obaba, which lies just an hour or so from the coastal cities where they work, engage in politics and go to bars. </p> <p>Boldly, after the worldwide success of Obabakoak , Atxaga switched genres in his next novel The Lone Man , an action thriller that brings off the difficult challenge of making the inner voice of its protagonist, the ex-terrorist Carlos, enthralling. Atxaga's style is calm and clear; he excels at writing unsentimentally about emotion. </p> <p>The new star of literature from the Celtic nation of Galicia, perched on top of Portugal, is Manuel Rivas. Galicia is a misty country of spectacular fjords, afflicted with rural poverty and emigration. Rivas's lyrical, yearning language captures how the old society of magical beliefs and sea legends underlies the modern. One of the best Spanish films of recent years, Butterfly , based on several Rivas stories, will introduce his work to Britain this summer. </p> <p>The elements of myth and fantasy found in Atxaga and Rivas, as they knit together rural history and urban worlds, are absent from the harsher, realist writers of proletarian Barcelona. Juan Mars\u00e9 has achieved what very few writers are capable of: creating his own fully imagined world, a Yoknapatawpha County in the city's Guinard\u00f3 quarter. Mars\u00e9, and his near contemporaries Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n and Eduardo Mendoza, portray neither the revolutionary city of 1936 that Orwell described nor the triumphant host of the 1992 Olympics. Mars\u00e9's subject matter is the hungry - with him at least, Brenan's dictum still holds - and violent children growing up in the 1940s under the dictatorship, with mothers in despair and fathers absent in graves, jails or exile. His narrative power arises from his angry nostalgia for childhoods destroyed by the long shadow of the Civil War. </p> <p>Though a lesser writer than Mars\u00e9, V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n is better known internationally. He is the Raymond Chandler of Spain, and Barcelona is his Los Angeles. His detective Pepe Carvalho is, like Philip Marlowe, a tough, honest sceptic equipped with the wisecracks and weapons required to deal with an evil urban world; he is also a sensual Mediterranean gourmet with a streak of melancholy. In Southern Seas and Off-side (a devastating satire on Barcelona Football Club), V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n portrays a rough, corrupt city. Reading him is a fierce corrective to the view promulgated by Barcelona's ruling elite that the city is a haven of exquisite architecture and harmonious living. </p> <p>Eduardo Mendoza is the most elegant of the Barcelona novelists. The Truth about the Savolta Case and City of Marvels are picaresque satires on the triumph of capitalism between Barcelona's two great exhibitions of 1888 and 1929. Mendoza, Mars\u00e9 and V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n all seek to reconstruct memory, too readily erased by an official Spain which is bent on forgetting a troubled past in its headlong rush to be more European than Brussels and more north American than the USA. </p> <p> The above three novelists write in Castilian Spanish. Jes\u00fas Montcada's The Towpath is written in Catalan, a thriving literature with over 5,000 titles published annually. Montcada tells the story of a rural town drowned under the flood waters of a dam on the Ebro, and through it the history of Catalonia this century. The Towpath contains a warning: if we lose our memories, we become like the citizens of the novel's new town, built to replace the old, living dull lives \"in identical houses on symmetrical streets scoured by the wind\". </p> <p>Completely different from these Catalan writers is Madrid's Javier Mar\u00edas, whose inventive novels are sombre meditations on failure and deceit and who won the 1997 IMPAC award for the best European novel with A Heart so White . He can be an irritating writer, given to long philosophical conceits and pedantic dissertations (it is no accident that he has translated Laurence Sterne into Spanish). Yet he is capable too of hilarious tours de force and dramatic action - the suicide in A Heart so White is one of the great openings in modern literature. </p> <p>No roundup of Spanish novels would be complete without the bestselling Arturo P\u00e9rez-Reverte, whose thrillers, well-researched and exciting, revolve around an intellectual problem, whether chess, fencing or computers. The plots, however, are in the end unsatisfying - something revealed in the poor films of his books, including Polanski's The Ninth Gate . P\u00e9rez-Reverte has a predilection for heroines who are exceptionally intelligent and beautiful; indeed, his characters often slip into stereotype. The settings, though, are strong, particularly The Fencing Master , which evokes 19th-century Madrid, or The Seville Communion, a recommended companion for visitors to Andalucia's capital.</p>",

A new readership was created too: nearly all the writers mentioned in this article, however literary, are big sellers. Spain's \"normalisation\" as a parliamentary democracy gave it something no other European country has: literature in four languages. Since the 1978 Constitution, Basque, Galician and Catalan, suppressed under Franco, are again taught in schools (they were always spoken in the home), and an audience has arisen for literature written in these languages. The best-known writer from the geographical periphery is the Basque Bernardo Atxaga. Born in 1951 in a village near San Sebastian, Atxaga tells how as a boy he accompanied his grandfather to collect electricity payments from the small hill farms. While his elders sipped wine, the child drank in the legends of the valley. Atxaga's great work, Obabakoak , exudes this oral tradition of the Basque countryside; its 27 interlinked stories recreate a world of winter evenings talking by the fireside. This may give the impression of a mythologising flight from the contemporary world into some lost and longed-for rural paradise, but there is no nostalgia in Atxaga; his stories are tough. The magical village of Obaba, which seems remote in history, is part of the modern world. His characters go abroad, speak foreign languages and drive cars to and from Obaba, which lies just an hour or so from the coastal cities where they work, engage in politics and go to bars. Boldly, after the worldwide success of Obabakoak , Atxaga switched genres in his next novel The Lone Man , an action thriller that brings off the difficult challenge of making the inner voice of its protagonist, the ex-terrorist Carlos, enthralling. Atxaga's style is calm and clear; he excels at writing unsentimentally about emotion. The new star of literature from the Celtic nation of Galicia, perched on top of Portugal, is Manuel Rivas. Galicia is a misty country of spectacular fjords, afflicted with rural poverty and emigration. Rivas's lyrical, yearning language captures how the old society of magical beliefs and sea legends underlies the modern. One of the best Spanish films of recent years, Butterfly , based on several Rivas stories, will introduce his work to Britain this summer. The elements of myth and fantasy found in Atxaga and Rivas, as they knit together rural history and urban worlds, are absent from the harsher, realist writers of proletarian Barcelona. Juan Mars\u00e9 has achieved what very few writers are capable of: creating his own fully imagined world, a Yoknapatawpha County in the city's Guinard\u00f3 quarter. Mars\u00e9, and his near contemporaries Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n and Eduardo Mendoza, portray neither the revolutionary city of 1936 that Orwell described nor the triumphant host of the 1992 Olympics. Mars\u00e9's subject matter is the hungry - with him at least, Brenan's dictum still holds - and violent children growing up in the 1940s under the dictatorship, with mothers in despair and fathers absent in graves, jails or exile. His narrative power arises from his angry nostalgia for childhoods destroyed by the long shadow of the Civil War. Though a lesser writer than Mars\u00e9, V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n is better known internationally. He is the Raymond Chandler of Spain, and Barcelona is his Los Angeles. His detective Pepe Carvalho is, like Philip Marlowe, a tough, honest sceptic equipped with the wisecracks and weapons required to deal with an evil urban world; he is also a sensual Mediterranean gourmet with a streak of melancholy. In Southern Seas and Off-side (a devastating satire on Barcelona Football Club), V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n portrays a rough, corrupt city. Reading him is a fierce corrective to the view promulgated by Barcelona's ruling elite that the city is a haven of exquisite architecture and harmonious living. Eduardo Mendoza is the most elegant of the Barcelona novelists. The Truth about the Savolta Case and City of Marvels are picaresque satires on the triumph of capitalism between Barcelona's two great exhibitions of 1888 and 1929. Mendoza, Mars\u00e9 and V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n all seek to reconstruct memory, too readily erased by an official Spain which is bent on forgetting a troubled past in its headlong rush to be more European than Brussels and more north American than the USA. The above three novelists write in Castilian Spanish. Jes\u00fas Montcada's The Towpath is written in Catalan, a thriving literature with over 5,000 titles published annually. Montcada tells the story of a rural town drowned under the flood waters of a dam on the Ebro, and through it the history of Catalonia this century. The Towpath contains a warning: if we lose our memories, we become like the citizens of the novel's new town, built to replace the old, living dull lives \"in identical houses on symmetrical streets scoured by the wind\". Completely different from these Catalan writers is Madrid's Javier Mar\u00edas, whose inventive novels are sombre meditations on failure and deceit and who won the 1997 IMPAC award for the best European novel with A Heart so White . He can be an irritating writer, given to long philosophical conceits and pedantic dissertations (it is no accident that he has translated Laurence Sterne into Spanish). Yet he is capable too of hilarious tours de force and dramatic action - the suicide in A Heart so White is one of the great openings in modern literature. No roundup of Spanish novels would be complete without the bestselling Arturo P\u00e9rez-Reverte, whose thrillers, well-researched and exciting, revolve around an intellectual problem, whether chess, fencing or computers. The plots, however, are in the end unsatisfying - something revealed in the poor films of his books, including Polanski's The Ninth Gate . P\u00e9rez-Reverte has a predilection for heroines who are exceptionally intelligent and beautiful; indeed, his characters often slip into stereotype. The settings, though, are strong, particularly The Fencing Master , which evokes 19th-century Madrid, or The Seville Communion, a recommended companion for visitors to Andalucia's capital.",

      "bodyText": "Toby Beresford likes to be different. He's independently-minded, outspoken and likely to be a challenge to authority. Untidy and dismal with detail, he is intellectually curious and may well take risks. In short, he is a textbook example of the kind of graduate every competent recruiter should be looking to employ. Ask a recruiter of the past what they looked for in a potential employee and they'd list vague competencies such as \"creativity\" and \"communication skills\". More frightening still would be the reply, 'the candidate least likely to fail' - aka The Safe Option. But times have changed - and to compete in the millennial workplace, organisations need to be innovative. Step forward Toby, who possesses many of the key characteristics now acknowledged to define an innovative graduate. To succeed, companies need to be aware of how to attract and handle graduates who are more challenging and radical so they can bring added value to business through their innovative potential. The Department of Trade and Industry defines innovation as \"the professional exploitation of new ideas\".

      "bodyText": "What's that awful racket in the distance? It's the sound of hordes of British youths enjoying a hedonistic week in Ibiza. Driven abroad by the demise of the Radio 1 Summer Roadshow, these young people are forced to endure extremely high temperatures, cheap accommodation, ear-bleeding decibels and the ever-present threat of \"trouble\" in the pursuit of pleasure. What does beachbeats.com do for these hapless young people? It warns them of the current temperature in Ibiza and Ayia Napa, providing practical guides to each of the resorts. Tips include a list of things to bring (passport, condoms, whistle) and things to avoid (staying out until only midnight, mouthing off to the Guardia Civil). And it gives away a crate of Smirnoff Red each week to help prepare clubbers for their holidays. Travellers can also book their flights and accommodation via the well-established bargainholidays.com: week-long packages start at around \u00a3250, although Cyprus is more expensive. Is the website just as noisy? Not initially, but depending on the power of their speakers, clubbers can play a number of dance videos loudly enough to annoy their parents and flatmates. They can also arrange to have details of club nights sent to their mobile phones. Still, given how slowly the pages load, it's more likely that these impatient young people will get bored and phone their friends for advice instead.",

The tables, bar, flooring - even the ashtrays - have been fashioned from the same white-and-black marble quarried in central Anatolia, according to Muzaffer's personal specification. </p> <p>Behind the two-storey building is a terraced orchard, planted with lemon, orange, fig and apricot trees. \"Eat as much as you like,\" says Muzaffer. But the Viewpoint's pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is its Ottoman terrace, roofed in bamboo, the sides open to the stars. In the evenings, guests recline on the low cushions - in one hand an aperitif made from Turkish almonds, in the other a pair of backgammon dice.

      "body": "<p>Bodh Gaya is a hot and dusty town at the heart of Bihar, one of India's poorest states. It was here that Siddhartha Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was said to have reached enlightenment while sitting under a bo tree, and Bodh Gaya is now an important pilgrimage site, with a complex of temples attracting thousands of pilgrims every day, as well as a semi-permanent beggar population who give the pilgrims a chance to improve their karma by throwing them a few rupees. At the centre of it all is the Mahabodhi Temple, the seventh-century homage to Siddhartha built on the spot where the great one found his calling, and which contains a bo tree believed to be the direct descendant of the one under which Buddha sat.</p> <p>In February 1997 I visited Bodh Gaya for a few days. The narrow streets were filled with Tibetan monks, Japanese pilgrims and Western travellers, and it was clear that some sort of a celebration was taking place. One of the monks told me that I had arrived at a very auspicious time: after years of searching, the reincarnation of a legendary Buddhist master, or lama, had been found, and he was currently being inaugurated into his new role at Mahabodhi. Usually the reincarnation of a lama is found when still a child. If he recognises the possessions of the former master, he will be accepted as the new one. So I went to the golden-spired temple, hoping to catch a glimpse of a serene five-year-old, wise and innocent, blessing the faithful. At the throne under the bo tree was a large middle-aged white man with not-quite good looks and a rather ratty ponytail. </p> <p>It was chunky action hero Steven Seagal, star of such video shop bargain bin blockbusters as Time To Kill, Under Seige and The Patriot. Seagal may not be up there with the Hollywood greats, but in the Buddhist hierarchy, he is just a notch down from the Dalai Lama himself.</p> <p>Lama Seagal is the ultimate bombastic Buddhist, cracking skulls one minute and contemplating the infinite nature of nothingness the next. Being recognised as a master who has achieved enlightenment but, out of his limitless compassion, has vowed to take rebirth to help reduce the suffering of all sentient beings is merely the latest in a long line of Zen-like achievements for Seagal. Born in 1951 in Michigan, he discovered the wisdom of the East at the age of seven, when he took up the martial art of aikido and professed to his parents that he was not of this cosmic realm. As a young man he migrated to Japan, and, not wishing to reveal his abilities at astral projection to those who might wish him harm, went by plane. Soon after, the young lama may or may not have worked for the Shah of Iran, Bishop Tutu, Anwar Sadat and the CIA; Seagal's claims have not been verified by anyone other than himself, but just as in his films, it seems that his life has been coloured by all kinds of secret conspiracies against him, plotted by those who have strayed from the path that leads to deliverance from all human forms of suffering.</p> <p>Seagal returned to the States as a master of aikido, and well-versed in Zen Buddhism and acupuncture, and in 1987 he set up a martial arts school in California. One of the students there was all-powerful Hollywood agent Mike Ovitz, who listened to his master's request to spread the message of holiness via one of the world's most effective mediums - action movies. By the time Seagal was recognised as a tulku (reincarnation) of the 17th-century translator-teacher Terton Chungdrag Dorje, he had established a familar screen alter ego for himself: a karate-chopping defender of the underdog, fighting evil and corruption with his bare hands and dispensing brutal justice to all who stand against him.</p> <p>But while the great Tibetan leader Penor Rinpoche recognised the special qualities of a lama within Seagal, the Hollywood establishment found it difficult to accept the new-found godlike status of one of its most lowly micro-stars. Big-hitters of the entertainment world like Richard Gere and Tina Turner have, after all, followed Tibetan Buddhism devoutly for many years, but while they rule the roost in cinemas and concert halls the world over, it is Terton Chungdrag Dorje (Seagal) who was sitting on that throne in Bodh Gaya.</p> <p>Strictly speaking, Gere et al, mere followers of the great Buddha, should exalt the pony-tailed one as the all-compassionate being he is, but Seagal was at once accused of bribing Penor Rimpoche and other high-ranking Buddhist leaders into recognizing him as the reincarnated lama. The great one replied to such accusations with typical magnanimity: \"Whenever someone has asked me if I am a tulku [reincarnation], I have said that I don't believe it is very important who I was in my last lives. I think it is important what I do in this life. And what I do in this life is only important if I can ease the suffering of others, if I can somehow make the world a better place, if I somehow serve Buddha and mankind, if I can somehow plant the seed of bodhicitta [the search for enlightenment] into people's hearts.\" Lama Terton Chungdrag Dorje Seagal's way of planting the seed of bodhicitta into people's hearts - by making incredibly violent B-movies - has caused some confusion, but just as the Buddha-nature is in all living things, so the message of the path to nirvana is in all of Seagal's films.</p> <p>In 1990's Hard To Kill, Seagal plays an LAPD officer who witnesses and tapes dirty dealings between a California senator and the mob. For most of the film the senator's hoods try to hunt him down, but his Buddha-nature eludes them. Perhaps the tape could be seen as a metaphor for the secret of enlightenment: he's got it, they can't have it, and they cannot realise that they are going the wrong way about searching for it. (A happy note: it was during the making of this film that Seagal met his very own \"Lady In Red\", 80s sex symbol Kelly Le Brock. They divorced in 1996.)</p> <p>In 1991's Out For Justice, he stars as Gino Felino, a tough Brooklyn cop whose hip-hop head wiggle reveals his wrong-side-of-the-tracks childhood. Gino's mission is to blow a doped-up gangster off the face of this material realm and into the Third Bardo, and in doing so help those who are suffering under the malign force of this wicked spirit. Here we have a classic example of Seagal showing compassion for the most lowly sentient beings, including a stray puppy who he befriends after an awesomely bloody shootout. Word, lama. </p> <p>Seagal hit the big-time with 1992's Under Seige, in which he plays a cook on a navy destroyer captured by deranged veteran Tommy Lee Jones. Seagal dispenses with an awesome number of baddies in this movie, but so what? Accepting the cycle of rebirth, he is merely moving these sentient beings into their next incarnation, where, with any luck, they will improve their karma by living more virtuous lives as sewer rats or mosquitoes. Then there's 1998's The Patriot, in which he plays a doctor fighting against a lethal virus. The virus, of course, is a symbol of all the ignorance in the world. Only Lama Seagal can cure it. Just like the endless lives through which we must pass until we reach nirvana, Seagal's films all melt into one another after a while, but the message is clearly there. Nobody could doubt his buddha-nature after watching a few of his subliminal positive-message classics - not even Lil' Kim, the inauspiciously dressed rap star whom Lama Seagal is currently hoping to make his spiritual partner. And after seeing that haughty, slightly overweight stallion of a man rightly enthroned under the bo tree at Bodh Gaya, I shall never again view Out For Justice as the sleazy piece of trash I was once misguided enough to judge it. </p> <p>\u0095 The Patriot is out on video on Monday (Cinema Club, \u00a35.99)</p>",

      "body": "<p>Just 15 years ago Lille was an ailing industrial city. Since then, it has had a radical face-lift, attracted a stylish retail industry and got itself on the London-Paris, London-Brussels high-speed rail network. So what does it have to offer the London crowd only two hours away? </p> <p>Ignore the sprawling glass structure that is the Euralille shopping centre and keep on walking past the handsome Lille-Flanders station (originally built in Paris but moved here brick by brick), cross the road and begin to breathe easy as you near the Grand' Place less than 100 yards away. </p> <p>Also known as the Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Gaulle (after one of the town's more famous sons), this was originally a bustling market place that nowadays has enough caf\u00e9s and terraces to make it the obvious starting point for any tour. </p> <p>Notable buildings around the square include the Vieille Bourse, or old stock exchange, which was built in 1653 by Julien Destr\u00e9e as a result of the persistent ill-health of the Lillois bankers and merchants. Trading had always taken place at the open the Fontaine-au-Change, whatever the weather, and the bankers endured regular bouts of flu and colds. By 1651 they had had enough and took their wheezy deputation to the Magistrate who, in turn, consulted Philip IV, King of Spain and the Count of Flanders. The result was a quadrangle of 24 ornately-decorated houses. Trading took place in the interior courtyard. Destr\u00e9e, a wood-carver, fashioned lions' heads, cherubs and other symbols of wealth and power in the Lezennes limestone. Though no longer the stock exchange, there is a daily second-hand book and flower market here. </p> <p>Le Grand' Garde building, on the square, was erected almost a century later by the Sun King, Louis XIV - the pediment shows his sun emblem and Lille's coat of arms - and is now the Th\u00e9atre du Nord. The square is also home to the biggest bookshop in Europe, Le Furet Du Nord, with its tangle of footbridges and aerial stairways. In the middle is the Goddess statue, commemorating the Austrian siege of Lille in 1792 and the French resistance to it. You can still see cannon balls protruding from the facades of the houses in Rang de Beauregard on Place du Th\u00e9atre, just behind the Vieille Bourse. </p> <p>The new stock exchange, which opened in 1903, is in the Place du Th\u00e9atre, and the neighbouring building is the famous Op\u00e9ra du Nord. </p> <p><strong> Museums</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Palais de Beaux Arts</strong> </p> <p>Place de la R\u00e9publique (Monday 2pm-6pm, Wednes day to Sunday 10am-6pm, closed Tuesday) </p> <p> Lille's Fine Arts museum is regarded in France as second only to the Louvre. The 19th-century building houses masterpieces by Rubens, Van Dyck, Goya (in particular Youth and Age), Delacroix , Courbet and 40 drawings by Raphael. </p> <p> <strong> Charles de Gaulle Museum</strong> </p> <p>Rue Princesse (10am-noon &amp; 2pm to 5pm except Monday, Tuesday and Bank Holidays) </p> <p> Charles de Gaulle was born in this house, inhabited then by his grandmother. Souvenirs of his childhood, his military career and his presidency are displayed here. </p> <p> <strong> Museum of the Hospice Comtesse </strong> Rue de la Monnaie (10am-12.30pm, 2pm to 6pm except Tuesday). </p> <p> The Hospice was founded in 1237 by Jeanne of Constantinople, but is now used as a museum to \"mirror Lille and the old Low Countries\" through Flemish and Dutch paintings, local porcelain, wood carvings and tapestries. There are also rare and ancient musical instruments within the Hel Collection. </p> <p><strong> Shopping for fashion</strong><br> </p> <p> Every designer label seems to have a retail outlet within the old town. It is hard to know where to flash your credit card first. </p> <p>In rue Grande Chaus\u00e9e, the Herm\u00e8s shop was \"awarded\" its opulent leather staircase because it has the highest turnover outside of Paris. </p> <p>La Botte Chantilly sells quality branded shoes. But even if shoes are not top of the agenda, go in and look through the rear glass wall to the elegant building that was the musketeer D'Artagnan's house. </p> <p>Xandres is an exclusive, chic Belgium import that has premiered in Lille, targetting women aged between 20 and 45 with a range of smart clothes and sportswear. </p> <p>Deschilder (6 rue des Chats Bossus) is a \"maroquinerie\" selling fancy leather goods. Planet London (rue des Clefs) sells silver satin trousers and other couture to ensure clubbers look the techno part in any disco. </p> <p>In rue Esquermoise, fashion shops include Clergerie, whose fabulously expensive clothes are frequently paraded in Elle. Accessoir'In is best described as a designer version of Accessorize and alongside the unusual jewellery is a collection of gloves, bags, scarves and hats by Christian Lacroix, Yves Saint-Laurent, Kenzo and Karl Lagerfeld. </p> <p>At La Compagnie Des Marques, there is a daily delivery of branded clothes at reduced prices and, with a little digging, you can uncover some good bargains. </p> <p>But serious bargain-hunters should head for the factory shopping outlets of L'Usine or McArthur Glenn in Roubaix, 10 minutes outside Lille. Both offer great savings on quality clothing. </p> <p><strong> Shopping for food</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Philip Olivier Fromagerie</strong> 3 rue du Cur\u00e9 Saint-Etienne </p> <p> Lille has its own pungent but tasty cheese called Vieux-Lille. Buy it here along with other regional cheeses such as Maroilles. </p> <p> <strong> Chocolat Passion Trogneux</strong> 67 rue Nationale </p> <p> Chocoholics are in good hands here for this is where the Chocolate Passion Club is based. Be adventurous and try the chocolates \u00e0 les bi\u00e8re de Jenlain - a dark chocolate mixed with Jenlain beer. </p> <p> <strong> Comtesse du Barry</strong> 21 rue Esquermoise </p> <p> Among the deli products here, try Flemish goodies such as prunes in armagnac tart as well as the typically French foie gras de canard - duck's liver pat\u00e9. </p> <p> <strong> Le Vins Gourmands</strong> 33 rue Esquemoise </p> <p> A quaint outlet offering not just wine, but also a range of regional spirits. </p> <p><strong> The local market</strong><br> </p> <p> The district of Wazemmes, about a mile from the old town, refuses to modernise. Shopping is done on Sundays in the famous market, where everything from antiques, fresh food and vegetables, flowers and regular jumble are on sale. The local shops in Rue Leon Gambetta stay open late to accommodate the extra custom. </p> <p><strong> Where to eat</strong><br> </p> <p> There are restaurants galore in Lille offering food from all over the world. But it would be a shame to miss out on the city's unique Flemish cuisine. If you find dishes you cannot get your tongue around, you know they have to be Flemish. The two most popular are potjevleisch , comprising a terrine of three meats - veal, pork and rabbit, or chicken, duck and rabbit - cooked with onions, garlic, white wine, lemon and tomatoes and served cold in a golden jelly. The second is Carbonnade \u00e0 la Flamande , a beef stew dish slow-cooked in beer and onions then sweetened with brown sugar. Wash it down with a regional beer and finish it off with the local tipple, geni\u00e8vre. </p> <p> <strong> Hochepot</strong> 6 rue du Nouveau Si\u00e8cle </p> <p> Regional food with a dash of pananche in the 17th-century Porte de Gand. Menu from FF185. </p> <p> <strong> La Terrasse des Ramparts </strong> Logis de la Porte de Gand, Rue de Gand </p> <p> Mini menu from FF95, \u00e0 la carte from FF180. </p> <p> <strong> Estaminet Trijsel</strong> 25 rue de Gand </p> <p> For authentic Flemish food and atmosphere, this caf\u00e9 has simple wooden furniture brightened up by antique pots, jugs and other earthenware, and is decorated with hops and barley. From approx FF60. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Mister Bed</strong> 57 rue de B\u00e9thune, tel: 03 20 12 96 96. </p> <p> A simple but clean hotel situated in a central pedestrianised zone - from FF160 to FF329. </p> <p> <strong> Le Breughel</strong> 3/5 parvis st Maurice, tel: 03 20 06 06 69. </p> <p> Charming two-star opposite the magnificent Saint Maurice church in the heart of Lille, from FF245 to F420 a night. </p> <p> <strong> Carlton Hotel</strong> 3 rue de Paris, tel: 03 20 13 33 13 </p> <p> Facing the opera house, this is elaborately furnished with Louis XVI and Louis XV antiques and has marble bathrooms.

      "bodyText": "Just 15 years ago Lille was an ailing industrial city. Since then, it has had a radical face-lift, attracted a stylish retail industry and got itself on the London-Paris, London-Brussels high-speed rail network. So what does it have to offer the London crowd only two hours away? Ignore the sprawling glass structure that is the Euralille shopping centre and keep on walking past the handsome Lille-Flanders station (originally built in Paris but moved here brick by brick), cross the road and begin to breathe easy as you near the Grand' Place less than 100 yards away. Also known as the Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Gaulle (after one of the town's more famous sons), this was originally a bustling market place that nowadays has enough caf\u00e9s and terraces to make it the obvious starting point for any tour. Notable buildings around the square include the Vieille Bourse, or old stock exchange, which was built in 1653 by Julien Destr\u00e9e as a result of the persistent ill-health of the Lillois bankers and merchants. Trading had always taken place at the open the Fontaine-au-Change, whatever the weather, and the bankers endured regular bouts of flu and colds. By 1651 they had had enough and took their wheezy deputation to the Magistrate who, in turn, consulted Philip IV, King of Spain and the Count of Flanders. The result was a quadrangle of 24 ornately-decorated houses. Trading took place in the interior courtyard. Destr\u00e9e, a wood-carver, fashioned lions' heads, cherubs and other symbols of wealth and power in the Lezennes limestone. Though no longer the stock exchange, there is a daily second-hand book and flower market here. Le Grand' Garde building, on the square, was erected almost a century later by the Sun King, Louis XIV - the pediment shows his sun emblem and Lille's coat of arms - and is now the Th\u00e9atre du Nord. The square is also home to the biggest bookshop in Europe, Le Furet Du Nord, with its tangle of footbridges and aerial stairways. In the middle is the Goddess statue, commemorating the Austrian siege of Lille in 1792 and the French resistance to it. You can still see cannon balls protruding from the facades of the houses in Rang de Beauregard on Place du Th\u00e9atre, just behind the Vieille Bourse. The new stock exchange, which opened in 1903, is in the Place du Th\u00e9atre, and the neighbouring building is the famous Op\u00e9ra du Nord. Museums Palais de Beaux Arts Place de la R\u00e9publique (Monday 2pm-6pm, Wednes day to Sunday 10am-6pm, closed Tuesday) Lille's Fine Arts museum is regarded in France as second only to the Louvre. The 19th-century building houses masterpieces by Rubens, Van Dyck, Goya (in particular Youth and Age), Delacroix , Courbet and 40 drawings by Raphael. Charles de Gaulle Museum Rue Princesse (10am-noon &amp; 2pm to 5pm except Monday, Tuesday and Bank Holidays) Charles de Gaulle was born in this house, inhabited then by his grandmother. Souvenirs of his childhood, his military career and his presidency are displayed here. Museum of the Hospice Comtesse Rue de la Monnaie (10am-12.30pm, 2pm to 6pm except Tuesday). The Hospice was founded in 1237 by Jeanne of Constantinople, but is now used as a museum to \"mirror Lille and the old Low Countries\" through Flemish and Dutch paintings, local porcelain, wood carvings and tapestries. There are also rare and ancient musical instruments within the Hel Collection. Shopping for fashion Every designer label seems to have a retail outlet within the old town. It is hard to know where to flash your credit card first. In rue Grande Chaus\u00e9e, the Herm\u00e8s shop was \"awarded\" its opulent leather staircase because it has the highest turnover outside of Paris. La Botte Chantilly sells quality branded shoes. But even if shoes are not top of the agenda, go in and look through the rear glass wall to the elegant building that was the musketeer D'Artagnan's house. Xandres is an exclusive, chic Belgium import that has premiered in Lille, targetting women aged between 20 and 45 with a range of smart clothes and sportswear. Deschilder (6 rue des Chats Bossus) is a \"maroquinerie\" selling fancy leather goods. Planet London (rue des Clefs) sells silver satin trousers and other couture to ensure clubbers look the techno part in any disco. In rue Esquermoise, fashion shops include Clergerie, whose fabulously expensive clothes are frequently paraded in Elle. Accessoir'In is best described as a designer version of Accessorize and alongside the unusual jewellery is a collection of gloves, bags, scarves and hats by Christian Lacroix, Yves Saint-Laurent, Kenzo and Karl Lagerfeld. At La Compagnie Des Marques, there is a daily delivery of branded clothes at reduced prices and, with a little digging, you can uncover some good bargains. But serious bargain-hunters should head for the factory shopping outlets of L'Usine or McArthur Glenn in Roubaix, 10 minutes outside Lille. Both offer great savings on quality clothing. Shopping for food Philip Olivier Fromagerie 3 rue du Cur\u00e9 Saint-Etienne Lille has its own pungent but tasty cheese called Vieux-Lille. Buy it here along with other regional cheeses such as Maroilles. Chocolat Passion Trogneux 67 rue Nationale Chocoholics are in good hands here for this is where the Chocolate Passion Club is based. Be adventurous and try the chocolates \u00e0 les bi\u00e8re de Jenlain - a dark chocolate mixed with Jenlain beer. Comtesse du Barry 21 rue Esquermoise Among the deli products here, try Flemish goodies such as prunes in armagnac tart as well as the typically French foie gras de canard - duck's liver pat\u00e9. Le Vins Gourmands 33 rue Esquemoise A quaint outlet offering not just wine, but also a range of regional spirits. The local market The district of Wazemmes, about a mile from the old town, refuses to modernise. Shopping is done on Sundays in the famous market, where everything from antiques, fresh food and vegetables, flowers and regular jumble are on sale. The local shops in Rue Leon Gambetta stay open late to accommodate the extra custom. Where to eat There are restaurants galore in Lille offering food from all over the world. But it would be a shame to miss out on the city's unique Flemish cuisine. If you find dishes you cannot get your tongue around, you know they have to be Flemish. The two most popular are potjevleisch , comprising a terrine of three meats - veal, pork and rabbit, or chicken, duck and rabbit - cooked with onions, garlic, white wine, lemon and tomatoes and served cold in a golden jelly. The second is Carbonnade \u00e0 la Flamande , a beef stew dish slow-cooked in beer and onions then sweetened with brown sugar. Wash it down with a regional beer and finish it off with the local tipple, geni\u00e8vre. Hochepot 6 rue du Nouveau Si\u00e8cle Regional food with a dash of pananche in the 17th-century Porte de Gand. Menu from FF185. La Terrasse des Ramparts Logis de la Porte de Gand, Rue de Gand Mini menu from FF95, \u00e0 la carte from FF180. Estaminet Trijsel 25 rue de Gand For authentic Flemish food and atmosphere, this caf\u00e9 has simple wooden furniture brightened up by antique pots, jugs and other earthenware, and is decorated with hops and barley. From approx FF60. Where to stay Mister Bed 57 rue de B\u00e9thune, tel: 03 20 12 96 96. A simple but clean hotel situated in a central pedestrianised zone - from FF160 to FF329. Le Breughel 3/5 parvis st Maurice, tel: 03 20 06 06 69. Charming two-star opposite the magnificent Saint Maurice church in the heart of Lille, from FF245 to F420 a night. Carlton Hotel 3 rue de Paris, tel: 03 20 13 33 13 Facing the opera house, this is elaborately furnished with Louis XVI and Louis XV antiques and has marble bathrooms. Pavarotti, Yehudi Menuhin and Kiri Te Kanawa have all stayed here when performing in Lille. Rooms from FF840 to FF2,600.

A day that began with England in the driving seat ended with the game at a crossroads thanks to a chalk-and-cheese opening partnership of 96 between Sherwin Campbell and Adrian Griffith. This pitch has already shown signs of uneven bounce - mainly when West Indies were bowling this morning - and England won't want to chase more than 150 in the final innings. </p> <p>On a day of four streakers Campbell flashed merrily and often airily outside off stump on his way to 55, while the more lugubrious Griffith prodded and poked his way to 41 not out, and generally looked about as unflamboyant as is possible when you're wearing that maroon helmet. </p> <p>It wasn't that England bowled badly (at least not until the final half hour when their determination to pepper Hinds with short-pitched deliveries backfired spectacularly). Andy Caddick beat Griffith repeatedly early on, Darren Gough was pacey, Dominic Cork found some swing and Robert Croft even more turn. But it took a brute of a ball from Craig White to break one of the Windies' weaker links.

      "bodyText": "This is turning into quite a Test match. A day that began with England in the driving seat ended with the game at a crossroads thanks to a chalk-and-cheese opening partnership of 96 between Sherwin Campbell and Adrian Griffith. This pitch has already shown signs of uneven bounce - mainly when West Indies were bowling this morning - and England won't want to chase more than 150 in the final innings. On a day of four streakers Campbell flashed merrily and often airily outside off stump on his way to 55, while the more lugubrious Griffith prodded and poked his way to 41 not out, and generally looked about as unflamboyant as is possible when you're wearing that maroon helmet. It wasn't that England bowled badly (at least not until the final half hour when their determination to pepper Hinds with short-pitched deliveries backfired spectacularly). Andy Caddick beat Griffith repeatedly early on, Darren Gough was pacey, Dominic Cork found some swing and Robert Croft even more turn. But it took a brute of a ball from Craig White to break one of the Windies' weaker links. Worryingly for England, there are stronger ones to come and the deficit is now down to just 15.

It was absolutely timeless, and it really hit me how lovely it was.\" </p> <p>As general secretary of the Open Spaces Society and chair of the access committee of the Ramblers' Association, Ashbrook is deeply involved in defending the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill from Opposition ambushes as it struggles towards gaining Royal Assent in Parliament. The Bill will establish the so-called \"right to roam\". </p> <p>She is also president of the Dartmoor Preservation Association, which gives her the opportunity for frequent visits to a part of England she's loved ever since she was a child. </p> <p>Ashbrook has stayed at Hill Bridge farm many times since first taking a riding holiday there when she was 10 years old, and she has completed her favourite walk countless times since then. Beginning a few miles north of the village of Peter Tavey, she follows a five-mile circuit of rocky tors, long ridges, boggy slopes and the hill forts and the standing stones of prehistoric tribes. </p> <p>The highlight of Ashbrook's walk is the top of White Tor, with its vast, varied and unchanging views in all directions - to Bodmin Moor and Cornwall in the west, to the Tamar estuary in the south, into the great, 15-mile expanse of the moor itself. </p> <p>In the foreground, for contrast, you can pick out the ancient stone circle on the flank of Langstone Moor, with Great Mis Tor behind it. </p> <p>The view to the heart of the moor is best described for Ashbrook by a phrase in a letter written to her by the Dartmoor preservation campaigner, Sylvia Sayer, who died in January this year and was a friend for nearly 30 years: \"She called it 'Dartmoor's long, calm lines', and I thought, absolutely, that's it - it's not necessarily dramatic, but it's very soothing and comforting, and just knowing that it's there is wonderful.\" </p> <p>But there's more to the walk than the landscape: it takes Ashbrook past groups of reddish-brown south Devon cattle, along old bridleways and lanes lined with granite walls, and past banks of wild flowers. </p> <p>The predominant colour is green in spring and summer, and \"a lovely warm brown colour\" in autumn and winter, and there are always birds: buzzards, crows, ravens, wheatears, pippets and skylarks. </p> <p>Unfortunately, there is also the grit in the oyster - the red flags and lookout huts of the army, who use a nearby part of the moor as a firing range. \"You pass a standing stone which has been bashed by the military,\" she says. \"They did the most appalling things to ancient monuments until they became more enlightened. It's just wrong that they should occupy this wonderful, wild landscape.\" </p> <p>Ashbrook likes walking alone, or with her partner or a friend. \"I think it gives me such a feeling of relaxation, but reinvigoration as well. It's getting away from what I normally do, and I find afterwards it's given me a great feeling of well-being. </p> <p>\"I will think things out as well - I can't stop my brain entirely. It's still churning away, but in a relaxed way, which is pleasant. I just let the thoughts come in and come out.\" </p> <p>Recently, Ashbrook rounded off her walk with a foray through Creason Wood, to swim in a secluded pool in the Tavey, next to a waterfall with the birds singing around her. \"It was so cold, it literally hurt. But it was refreshing and wonderful as well.\" </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong><br></p> <p>There are rail stations close to the eastern, southern and western edges of Dartmoor.

There was an outcry when the principal landowner, the Duchy of Cornwall (headed by Prince Charles), granted a 21-year lease to the Ministry of Defence in the early 1990s. </p> <p>Other threats to the conservation of the moor include the pressure from 10 million visitors a year, the industrial pressure for quarrying and mining, and the growth of areas of bracken at the expense of the heather, which gives much of Dartmoor its character and beauty. </p> <p>Dartmoor National Park Authority is continuing a campaign called Moor Care, which repairs and restores eroded areas and encourages visitors to support \"sustainable tourism\" - by avoiding certain paths during wet weather, for example.</p>",

It's just wrong that they should occupy this wonderful, wild landscape.\" Ashbrook likes walking alone, or with her partner or a friend. \"I think it gives me such a feeling of relaxation, but reinvigoration as well. It's getting away from what I normally do, and I find afterwards it's given me a great feeling of well-being. \"I will think things out as well - I can't stop my brain entirely. It's still churning away, but in a relaxed way, which is pleasant. I just let the thoughts come in and come out.\" Recently, Ashbrook rounded off her walk with a foray through Creason Wood, to swim in a secluded pool in the Tavey, next to a waterfall with the birds singing around her. \"It was so cold, it literally hurt. But it was refreshing and wonderful as well.\" The practicals There are rail stations close to the eastern, southern and western edges of Dartmoor. National Rail Enquiries: 08457 484950. For coaches to devon, call the national Express Enquiry Line on 08705 808080. Local bus details, call DevonBus enquiry line on 01392 382800 or www.devon-cc.gov.uk/devonbus .

Rights of passage All but a fraction of the unenclosed moorland on Dartmoor is open to walkers, thanks to long-established rights of way, the Dartmoor Commons Act of 1985, and access agreements negotiated with landowners. The remaining fraction is likely to be accessible within a few years of the passage of the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill, which will establish the so-called \"right to roam\" on open country, now being debated in Parliament. The main restriction on access is the use by the Army of the huge firing ranges for part of the time. There was an outcry when the principal landowner, the Duchy of Cornwall (headed by Prince Charles), granted a 21-year lease to the Ministry of Defence in the early 1990s. Other threats to the conservation of the moor include the pressure from 10 million visitors a year, the industrial pressure for quarrying and mining, and the growth of areas of bracken at the expense of the heather, which gives much of Dartmoor its character and beauty. Dartmoor National Park Authority is continuing a campaign called Moor Care, which repairs and restores eroded areas and encourages visitors to support \"sustainable tourism\" - by avoiding certain paths during wet weather, for example.",

From a Spike Lee ensemble player (Malcolm X, Crooklyn, Clockers) to made-for-cable stardom to a movie-stealing run of recent supporting turns in The Cider House Rules, the upcoming Romeo Must Die and current release Gone In 60 Seconds, Lindo has never failed to impress. And in 60, that's not easy, competing as his implacable detective does with a ring of charismatic car thieves, plus 50 of the hottest hot luxury vehicles. It's no surprise that Lindo is about the only one who emerges from this car wreck of a movie with his humanity intact.</p> <p><strong>Was it weird to play the only honest man in this whole movie? </strong></p> <p>I'll tell you, when I read the script I said, Damn!

Did you have fun making this? </strong></p> <p>The best part was the sessions I had at Bobby Orr's defensive driving school prior to filming. So consequently, I felt very safe doing those stunts, and that was very liberating. It was very gratifying to do a lot of my own stunt driving. </p> <p><strong>Are you a safe driver? </strong></p> <p>Yes I am. My lady may disagree, but I'm a pretty safe driver. But one thing about driving where I live, in New York: it brings out the worst in me. It certainly increases your ability to fend for yourself and look out for Number One, but that's not necessarily the same thing as being the safest person. </p> <p><strong>You're originally from Britain. Do you think you relate to living in America differently than people who were born there? </strong></p> <p>I was born in London and came to the US as a teenager.

I always feel that people only remember the last thing that I did, and that's unfortunate. </p> <p><strong>Along those lines, you got great notices for your work in Cider House Rules and now you're part of this major summer action film. Do you feel you're closer now than ever before to achieving your professional goals? </strong></p> <p>It sounds kind of boring and cliched, but my goal is to do good and interesting work that people want to come see. In terms of visibility, let's go back to Get Shorty and Ransom five years ago: both big commercial successes and I was a major part of those films. That raised visibility, but there isn't necessarily any relationship between being in a big, commercial film and personally translating it to my career going somewhere. It's not a logical progression. Two and two don't make four in my reality. For some actors, it does, but for me it doesn't. It's just ever-evolving. </p> <p><strong>You seem so intense.

      "body": "<p>Madasgascar is a wonderful island. Admittedly, it is one of the poorest countries in the world. But that doesn't stop tourists quickly romanticising about the place to an almost absurd extent. </p> <p>And why not? After all, if everywhere is falling under the stern heel of western culture, isn't it good to fall in love with somewhere that offers a different and more materially modest way of living? And Madagascar, at best, does that, challenging and charming westerners in equal measure. </p> <p>This island, the fourth largest in the world after Greenland, New Guinea and Borneo (it's twice as big as our rain-soaked sixpence of a country), sits in the shark-infested waters of the Indian Ocean, a jewel of gentle wonder. It's as semi-detached from Africa as Britain is from Europe, though infinitely less rambunctious in its relations with its neighbours. </p> <p>Most tourists go there for the flora and fauna - for orchids, baobabs, lemurs, jauntily coloured frogs the size of your thumb, but most of all for that fast-disappearing world, the primary rainforest. If Darwin had turned left rather than right when he got to the bottom of the Atlantic, he would have found Madagascar, which is like the Galapagos only more so. </p> <p>Here is a little wonderworld of endemic species evolving in splendid isolation - vanga birds with their extraordinary beaks, teddy-bear-faced indri-indri with their soulful cries, forest after intriguing forest of organic surprises. </p> <p>Most people come to Madagascar after hearing the call of its nature. But, once there, they become equally seduced by the people. To sit in a crowded taxi-brousse (mini-bus), with your face in someone's armpit or chicken, is to realise that this is a land of beautiful people, preternaturally calm in the crush, staring with endless fascination at the red-faced vazha (foreigner) with his impressive collection of insect bites and feeble grasp of the Malagasy language. </p> <p>Madagascar represented the first time that I had been to a developing country, so the poverty was a tremendous shock. But my guilt about being a tourist in the world's ninth poorest country was constantly challenged. It was all right for me to climb into a rickshaw (known in this former French colony as pousse-pousses ) and be pulled by a barefoot, sweating boy from hotel to ethnographic museum (three miles at least) for the equivalent of 70p, so long as I gave him a good tip. Guilt, after all, is a luxury product. </p> <p>I was picked up by my main guide, Lalaina Ramaroson, at Itavo airport and driven around the outskirts of the capital, Antananarivo. Immediately, we were in third-world gridlock. My lungs quickly filled with the smells of a million charcoal stoves and with appalling fumes from aged exhausts. But what a fascinating traffic jam: France (which colonised this island from 1895 to 1960 and still sinks its claws deep into Malagasy society) exports its old bangers here, and the Malagasy, inveterate recyclers, keep them going for decades. </p> <p>You could readily come here to spot species of car that you had thought extinct - taxis are Renault 4s, Peugeots that look like Austin Cambridges still thrive. Look! A lesser-spotted Simca! But the Malgasy don't only recycle, they use everything intensively: not a bicycle passed by without a passenger or an unfeasible load straddling the crossbar. Heads are for carrying water buckets from the village tap. Boys push giggling girls in wheelbarrows. Pairs of zebu (the local cattle) pull carts laden with crops or else sit in the traffic doing nothing but contemplating their cud and causing mayhem. There was the odd, solitary white face behind the tinted windows of a 4x4. Such was my first brush with Madagascar. </p> <p>At Vakona Lodge, a posh hotel that is made up of pretty bungalows on the edge of the rainforest, I laid my jet-lagged head to rest, lulled by the sound of the indri-indri from nearby trees. These are the biggest of the lemur family, and their communication cry is as plaintive as a whale's, though higher pitched. </p> <p>At dusk I emerged from my rooms with a torch and the fetching fragrance of mosquito repellent, and went for a night nature walk in the company of an insightful guide Maurice Besoa Ratsiskanana. At first we spotted nothing apart from a boy and a girl out for a tryst in the rainforest. \"Homo sapiens,\" whispered Maurice, like a droller David Attenborough. Then he spied twin red dots drilling through the night and trained his headlamp on them. These were the eyes of the nocturnal mouse lemur, which is as small as a thumb, though infinitely more cute. A green chameleon stuck itself to the underside of a leaf, but Maurice brought it to my attention. Gekkos, panther chameleons, frogs and the female common sunbird anisty perched on a eucalyptus tree kept me captivated. Under such a night sky, you could believe in a beneficent god. And, for a while, I did. </p> <p>The following morning, I was up, if not with the lark, then with some early-rising Madagascar bird with a tricksy little trill. I was ready for a walk in the Mantadia rainforest, one of the few remaining primary forests on this island. As it rained, we climbed. When the rain stopped, I shook trees for a cooling shower - just what I needed after ascending the difficult paths to the heights of the forest floor. </p> <p>\"Have you ever seen a leech?\" asked Maurice. He had one on his jeans. But it was as nothing compared to the one he spotted immediately afterwards on my hand, a big fat number that had spent the previous few minutes sucking down my coffee-and-croissant-charged blood. The little bugger! </p> <p>At the top of the climb, near a graphite mine, we saw two black-and-white roughed lemurs, grooming each other. Another looked down on us intently from the treetops with orangey eyes. He had a black face with white sideburns and a receding white hairline. He looked like the bloke on the Uncle Ben's rice packets until he flung himself from tree to tree and then dangled upside down from a branch with one black hand. Uncle Ben can't do that. </p> <p>A close encounter with a family of five indri-indri in the nearby reserve of Perinet provided further proof that lemurs are natural entertainers. Then, fully restored by a good night's sleep, Lalaina and I flew from the rainforest to the desert in the south west. We took a 4x4 up the coast to Lakana Vezo, a beach resort designed for the prosperous to go scuba diving around the Mozambique Channel's exceptional coral reefs. </p> <p>Such is the vertical integration of Madagascar's tourist trade that, when you wander off the beach and into the village, you abruptly find yourself in a different world. Not a totally terrible one, but one in which happy naked kids play in the dust outside their mud huts to the extraordinary sounds of tsapiky, south Madagascar's barmily fast-paced music. The dearth of old people is disturbing: it's in places like this, rural, ill-educated and remote from the cosmopolitan capital, that healthcare is patchy and, consequently, life expectancy low. </p> <p>My own life expectancy appeared to be very short when I ventured out for my first attempt at scuba diving. After strapping on all the necessaries, I pushed off underwater with the instructor holding my hand. I have never been so intimate with a Frenchman, nor do I propose to repeat the experience. He was Tinkerbell and I was Peter Pan as we flew through this submarine fairyland of coloured fish, lavender-tipped coral and shy shoals that disappear as soon as you so much as look at them. </p> <p> On the other side of the reefs sharks hold sway, and it was hard not to swim here without fear. In any event, there were perils enough in these calm waters: the instructor pointed to some speckled stones, which I reached out to touch. He grabbed my hand and pushed me roughly away and we wound up struggling underwater, me thinking in my sudden panic that I was under attack. In fact, he had just saved my life - a well-camouflaged stone fish rose from the bed which, had I succeeded in touching it, would have poisoned me. It takes only seven minutes to kill a human being, and the only way it can be neutralised is by cauterising the poisoned flesh, an operation that is pretty tricky underwater. </p> <p>My near-death appeared a distant memory as Lalaina and I sat over breakfast in the beachfront restaurant the following morning, under blissful bamboos trees and a scorching sun, three fishermen passing in front of us aboard their pirogue (a catermaran-like fishing boat) singing Muslim prayers. It was a lovely moment, and prompted me to ask Lalaina about Madagascar's religious make-up. According to him, 60% of Malagasy people are Christians, 30% animists and 10% Muslim. </p> <p>But the reality behind these figures is more complex. Lalaina, for instance, is a Catholic, but he and his family still hold to some ancient Malagasy animistic beliefs. Last year, his family performed a ceremony during which they turned the bones of his grandmother. She died in 1972, but this was the third time they had dug her up and dressed her in new shrouds. </p> <p>Such Malagasy customs express the belief that death is the most important part of life, and that dead ancestors exert a powerful influence over the living. A house is a temporary dwelling, but often lavish tombs are forever. As a result, in country areas particularly, people live in modest mud huts with bamboo branches for roofs, but when the head of the family dies, a lavish tomb will be built for him which will be surmounted by the skulls of his ritually slaughtered zebu. Zebu symbolise wealth in Madagascar, though this, I suspect, is of little consolation to the surviving members of the family who have to get by without their chief breadwinner and their exceptionally valuable livestock. </p> <p>But then, animistic Malagasy culture, involving as it does a complex system of taboos called fady, a notion of destiny called vintana (that makes, for instance, Monday an ill-advised day on which to build a house), is so different from anything I have ever known before that it would be arrogant of a westerner to even attempt to make a judgment about it. Better to consider it just one more of the mysteries that make Madagascar a magical and emotive destination. </p> <p> <strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> Stuart Jeffries travelled courtesy of Rainbow Tours (tel: 020-7226 1004; fax: 020-7226 2621). A 12-night tour, including return flights from London to Antananarivo, accommodation and internal flights, costs from \u00a31,925. </p> <p>At present, there are no direct flights from Britain to Madagascar, so flights to Antananarivo go via Paris with Air Madagascar. Rainbow can organise visas on request; otherwise apply to the Malagasy embassy (020 8746 0133). They can be also be obtained on arrival at Antananarivo airport.</p> <p> <strong>Where to eat and drink</strong><br></p> <p>Eating and drinking well, and for less than a tenner, is easy for the tourist in Madagascar. The combination of French colonisation, Indonesian settlers as well as wonderful fresh fruit, vegetables and seafood all makes for good meals. </p> <p>As for drink, the Malagasy wine is vinegary, but the beers (especially Three Horses Beer) are excellent. </p> <p><strong> Villa Vanille</strong> (Antananarivo). An extraordinary place patronised by rich Malagasy and foreign diplomats. It is an old French colonial house staffed by deferential waiters and hostesses brimming with hauteur. Traditional Malagasy music most nights. </p> <p><strong> O! Poivre Vert</strong> (Antananarivo). This is a small place off the capital's main street, l'Avenue de l'Ind\u00e9pendance, which serves the best pizza I have ever eaten in the southern hemisphere (actually the only one, but it was good nonetheless). You can watch the chef cook them in the wood-fired oven, which is nice. </p> <p><strong> Au Grille du Rova</strong> (Antananarivo). I didn't manage to get a table here, but if you can, then go for it. The view (from one of Tana's 12 hills) across the city alone makes this terrace worth dining at, but apparently the food is also wonderful. </p> <p><strong> Chez Maggie</strong> (in the coastal town of Morondava). This is a lovely beach-front hotel run by a delightful Scotswoman called Maggie Macdonald. The restaurant, open to non-residents, serves wonderful seafood. I had fresh crab steamed in coriander and spices, followed by garlicky shrimps - all eaten in a beautiful room built from carved palissandre wood. Eat, drink and be merry while watching the sun set spectacularly below the Mozambique Channel.</p>",

      "body": "<p>One day in 1944, my housemate and I were having a party, and our friend George brought <strong> Andr\u00e9 Deutsch</strong>. Andr\u00e9, a Hungarian the same age as I was (26), had come to England to study economics, had been caught by the war, and had been interned as an enemy alien on the Isle of Man. The Hungarians were soon let out on condition that they reported regularly to the authorities, and Andr\u00e9 now worked for the publishers Nicolson and Watson. His being the first person I had ever met who was \"in publishing\" was enough to exalt him in my eyes. </p> <p>He was small, trim and good-looking in a boyish way. I remember thinking that his mouth was as fresh and soft-looking as a child's, and being surprised that I found it attractive - usually I liked my men on the rugged side. He sat on the floor and sang The Foggy, Foggy Dew, which was unexpected in a Hungarian, and charming, so that I was more aware of him than of anyone else in the room. Two days later, when he asked me to dinner and a theatre, I was gratified. After the theatre, we ate an omelette and went to bed together, without - as I remember it - much excitement on either side. </p> <p>In old age I can still remember the matchless intoxication of falling in love (which may well be a neurotic condition, but still nothing else lights up the whole of one's being in that way) and the more common but no less delicious sensations of a powerful physical attraction; but I have gone blurry about the kind of affair I had with Andr\u00e9. I wonder what took me into such affairs, and what held me in them, almost always, until the man moved on. Rather than remembering, I have to work it out. </p> <p>It was not thinking myself in love when I was not - I was too clear-sighted for that. And it was not simply the nesting instinct, because I was romantic enough (or perhaps realist enough?) to be sure that I couldn't marry a man I didn't love. To start with it was probably curiosity - a cat-like impulse to poke my nose round the next corner - combined with the emptiness of my emotional life at the time: this would at least seem to fill it. And once it had got going . . . well, perhaps the nesting instinct did start to come into it, after all. Although I knew from experience that whenever I genuinely fell in love it happened almost on sight, perhaps in this other kind of affair I allowed myself to slide into a vague hope that this time, given the chance, love might develop. And anyway I was pleased to be wanted; I liked the social and erotic occupations involved; I enjoyed being fond of someone; and I continued to be moved by curiosity. Quite early in my career the image of a glass-bottomed boat came to me as an apt one for sex; a love-making relationship with a man offered chances to peer at what went on under his surface. </p> <p>It was soon apparent that Andr\u00e9 and I would not be lovers for long. I felt that I could have enjoyed making love with him if he had been more enthusiastic about making love with me, and given my essential coldness since the shock of losing the man I really wanted - the man I was engaged to, who was serving in the Middle East, had first gone silent on me, then married someone else, then been killed - he probably felt the same about me: less than adequate grounds for an affair. And he was an insomniac whose bed, though a double one, was not wide. When I wanted to sleep, he wanted to sit up and read the Times, and what he wanted to do he did, with much uninhibited rustling: it was his house, his bed - and insomnia commands respect while somnolence is boring. Englishwomen are notorious for somnolence, he told me tetchily. He often remarked on the shortcomings of the English as lovers, a habit shared by many continental men with a touching failure to see how easily it can provoke the bitten-back response, \"Who are you to talk?\" Rather than enjoying the dozen or so nights we spent together, we went through them \"because they were there\", and the only sadness I felt when he moved on to another bedfellow was the knee-jerk reaction, \"There you are, you see - you're unable to keep anyone.\" Understanding that I owed this droopy feeling to the fianc\u00e9 who had jilted me, I didn't hold it against Andr\u00e9. It turned out that the slightness of our affair did not matter because - mystifyingly, given how unlike we are in temperament - we had ended it as friends. </p> <p>We continued to meet, I became his confidante about his love-life, and he introduced me to his other friends. Before long, a feeling of being \"family\" grew up between Andr\u00e9 and me. It was this feeling which made it natural for us both to expect me to be involved in his plans when he decided that he would start a publishing house as soon as the war ended . . . not that my own expectations, to begin with, were anything but provisional. He had no money and no connections: how could he possibly start a publishing house? It was like someone saying, \"When I win the football pools.\" But of course if he did win them, I would want to be in on it. </p> <p>While Andr\u00e9 was with [the publishing firm] Nicolson and Watson, <strong> George Orwell</strong> submitted Animal Farm to them and John Roberts, the managing director, asked Andr\u00e9 to read it for him. Andr\u00e9 declared it wonderful, but Roberts, when he heard what it was about, said: \"Nonsense, laddie - no one nowadays wants to make fun of Uncle Joe.\" Andr\u00e9, who was determined to help the penniless and modest Orwell whom he saw as almost saint-like, decided that Jonathan Cape was the right publisher for him, and Orwell took his advice. Cape accepted the book, but shared Roberts's doubts to the extent of making a condition: it must be checked by some sort of official authority to make sure that it was not considered damaging to the war effort. And it was so considered: His Majesty's Government sincerely hoped that Mr Cape would refrain from publishing something so sharply critical of our Soviet Ally - and Mr Cape did refrain. </p> <p>Orwell, who by this time was getting pretty desperate and who knew that Andr\u00e9 was planning to start his own firm as soon as he could raise a little capital, then said to Andr\u00e9: \"Look, why don't you do it? Why don't you start off your firm with it?' And Andr\u00e9, strongly tempted to pounce but still far from sure that he would be able to start a firm however much he wanted to, felt that he must not let a man he liked and respected so deeply take such a risk. No, he said. And the essential resilience of his nature was later to be well illustrated by the fact that the more famous Animal Farm became, the prouder he was of his own early recognition of it and of his not letting Orwell take the risk of giving it to him, with never a moan at having lost this prize. </p> <p>Andr\u00e9 started his first publishing house, Allan Wingate, late in 1945; I was his employee, an editor. The most important book in the history of Allan Wingate was <strong> Norman Mailer's </strong> first novel, The Naked And The Dead, which came to us from an agent desperate because six of London's leading publishers had rejected it in spite of its crossing the Atlantic on a wave of excitement (it was one of those books, always American at that time, which are mysteriously preceded by a certainty that they will cause a stir). Our list had gained substance and our sales organisation was seen to be good, but we were still too small to be any agent's first choice for a big book - or indeed even their seventh choice, had they not concluded that none of the more firmly established houses was going to make an offer. </p> <p>The book was a war novel, all its characters soldiers going through hell in the Pacific, where Mailer himself had served. He was bent on conveying the nature of these soldiers and their experiences accurately, so naturally he wanted the men in his novel to speak like the men he had known, which meant using the words \"fuck\" and \"fucking\", and using them often. His American publishers had told him that although they knew it to be a great book, they could not publish it, and nor would anyone else (which appeared to be true) with those words spelt out. I believe the use of \"f-\" was suggested; but \"fuck\" and \"fucking\" occurred so often that this would have made the dialogue look like fish-net, so \"fug\" and \"fugging\" were agreed as substitutes. </p> <p>It might be argued that the six English publishers who rejected the book because of the obscenity of its language were less ridiculous than the American publisher who accepted this solution. Given the premise from which they were all working, that \"fuck\" was unprintably obscene, how could another word which sounded so nearly the same, and which was loaded with the same meaning, not be equally obscene? There has never, I think, been a clearer demonstration of the idiocy of making words taboo. </p> <p>We, of course, pounced. It is many years since I re-read the book and much of it is now hazy in my mind, but I still have a strong memory of a passage in which exhausted men are struggling to manhandle a gun out of deep mud, which makes me think that I was right in feeling that it was very good - a book which had genuinely expanded the range of my imagination. We wanted to restore the \"fucks\" but dared not; and as it turned out we were right not to dare. </p> <p>Review copies went out to the press about three weeks before publication, and the literary editor of the Sunday Times left his lying about in his office. The newspaper's editor, who was an old man nearing retirement, ambled in and chanced to pick it up and open it. The first thing to meet his eye was \"fug\" . . . followed by \"fug\" and \"fug\" again. So that Sunday, on the paper's front page, there appeared a short but furious protest, written by the editor himself, against the projected publication of a book so vile that (and he truly did use these words) \"no decent man could leave it where his women or children might happen to see it\". </p> <p>As always on a Sunday I was sleeping late, so I was cross when I had to answer the front-door bell at eight-thirty. There stood Andr\u00e9, unshaven, a pair of trousers and a macintosh pulled on over his pyjamas, and a copy of the Sunday Times in his hand. </p> <p>\"Read this!\" </p> <p>\"Oh my God!\" </p> <p>I was as alarmed as he was. The book was printed and bound - the first printing was large - it was a long book, expensive to manufacture . . . close to the wind as the firm was still having to sail, if this book was banned we would go down. </p> <p>\"Hurry and get some clothes on,\" said Andr\u00e9. \"We must rush a copy to Desmond McCarthy - I've got his address.\" </p> <p>McCarthy was the most influential reviewer then writing. We scribbled a note begging him to read the book at once and to say publicly that it was not obscene, then we set off to push it through his letter-box. To insist on seeing him so early on a Sunday morning might, we felt, put him off. In retrospect, the chief value of our outing was that it was something to do in this nerve-racking situation: I don't think that McCarthy's eventual response can have been more than civil, or I would not have forgotten it. </p> <p>Next morning orders started pouring into the office, and only then did it occur to us that if we were not heading for disaster, it might be a triumph. Meanwhile we were instantly served with an injunction against publishing The Naked And The Dead until the Attorney General, Sir Hartley Shawcross, had considered the case and had given us permission to do so (if he did). Whether the injunction was handed over by the large and apparently amiable police detective who spent the morning questioning us all, or whether it came separately, I do not know. </p> <p>During the next two or three weeks the flood of orders nearly submerged us, the frustration of not being able to supply them became acute, and the encouragement we received from everyone we knew began to make triumph seem more likely than disaster. Finally Andr\u00e9 persuaded an MP of his acquaintance to ask a question in the House of Commons about the book's fate: was the Attorney General going to ban it or not? The answer was no - a rather grudging one in that Shawcross said that he thought it was a bad book, but still no. So we were off - into, ironically, quite worrying financial problems, because we were hard put to it to pay for the several reprints we had to order. </p> <p>What we gained from this adventure was more than a good and best-selling novel; more, even, than the presence of Norman Mailer on our list from then on. Overnight we began to be seen as a brave and dashing little firm, worth serious attention from agents handling interesting new writers, and Andr\u00e9's welcome when he visited New York became even more richly rewarding. </p> <p>The poet <strong> Stevie Smith</strong> found life difficult; although she solved the problem cleverly and decisively by withdrawing from those parts of it that were too much for her and keeping to a well-defined territory of her own. She was amusing, and - strangely, given the cautious nature of her strategy - met one with a beguiling openness, so that I always started our meetings with the feeling that we were about to become close friends. We never did, and I think the reason was sexual. I was still young enough to be at heart more interested in my own sexual and romantic activities than in anything else (though mostly I kept them out of my office life), so Stevie's nervous asexuality distanced her. She almost fainted when she first came into my office, because I had on my wall a print of snakes. All the blood left her face and she could hardly make audible a plea that I should take the print down (after that I always removed it as soon as she was announced). Perhaps the notion that a phobia about snakes relates to their phallic quality is old-fashioned and misguided, but I supposed it to be true, and saw Stevie's phobia as revealing. I'm sorry to say that some part of me slightly despised the fear of sex I sensed in her; and I hope that she got her own back (this is far from unlikely) by slightly despising its opposite quality in me. </p> <p>We were lucky enough to publish <strong> Philip Roth's</strong> first books and almost all of John Updike's. Roth, even more than Mailer, was a writer whose fame preceded his work: when his very gifted little first novel, Goodbye, Columbus, crossed the Atlantic it was all but invisible for the haze of desirability surrounding it, so that no one doubted for a moment that we had made a valuable catch. Then came Letting Go, which I thought wonderful, although I agreed with Andr\u00e9 that it was too long - not \"by a third\", as he said, but still too long. So we asked each other whether we should raise the matter with Philip and agreed that it would be too dangerous; there was such a buzz going on about him, everyone was after him - annoy him and he would be gone in a flash. And anyway it would be difficult to cut because it was all so good - there was not a dead line in it. Much of that novel is dialogue and I got the impression that Philip's brilliance with dialogue had gone to his head: he had enjoyed doing it so much that he couldn't bring himself to stop. So we accepted it as it was and it didn't earn its advance. (Imagine my feelings when he said to me, several years later: \"The trouble with Letting Go is that it's far too long.\") Then came a novel called When She Was Good, told from the point of view of a young woman from the Middle West, non-Jewish, who struck me as being pretty obviously Philip's first wife. I never talked to him about this book, so what I say here is no more than my hunch, but I thought, \"This is an exercise - he is trying to prove to himself that he doesn't have to write as a Jew and a man.\" And as I read I kept telling myself, \"It must soon come alive - it must.\" And it didn't. </p> <p>So we thought, \"No more silly money\", and decided to calculate the advance on precisely what we reckoned the book would sell - which I think was 4,000 copies at the best - and that was not accepted. As far as I know, When She Was Good was not a success - but the next novel Philip wrote was Portnoy's Complaint. </p> <p>This space represents a tactful silence. </p> <p> <strong> John Updike </strong> , on the other hand, was never set up as a star and never disappointed. From a publisher's point of view he was a perfect author: an extremely good writer who knows his own worth but is also well-informed about the realities of publishing and bookselling. And he is an exceptionally agreeable man, interesting, amusing and unpretentious, who knows how to guard his privacy without being unfriendly. I like John very much, always enjoyed meeting him, and never felt inclined to speculate about whatever he chose to keep to himself, so I have nothing to say about him except the obvious fact that we would have been a much less distinguished publishing house without him. </p> <p>No one who has read <strong> Jean Rhys's</strong> first four novels can suppose that she was good at life; but no one who never met her could know how very bad at it she was. I started corresponding with her in 1957; but I didn't meet her until 1964; and as a result I did almost nothing to help her during a long period of excruciating difficulty. </p> <p>It was not, perhaps, her very worst time. That must have been the last three years of the 40s, when she and her third husband, Max Hamer, were living at Beckenham in Kent, their money had run out, and Max, a retired naval officer, became so desperate that he stumbled into trouble which ended in a three-year prison sentence for trying to obtain money by fraudulent means. During that nightmare Jean, paralysed by depression, could do nothing but drink herself into a state so bad that she, too, was several times in court and once in jail. By the time we were in touch Max had served his sentence, they had crept away to a series of miserable lodgings in Cornwall, and Jean was no longer quite at rock-bottom; but she still had nine terribly difficult years ahead of her before re-emerging as a writer. </p> <p>She had always been a private person, but she was known in literary circles when her fourth novel, Good Morning, Midnight, came out in 1939. When the war began a lot of people \"disappeared\" in that they were carried away from their natural habitat on joining the forces or taking up war-work. Jean followed her second husband out of London, so when he died, and she slithered with Max into their misfortunes, she was no longer in touch with former acquaintances and became \"lost\". It was said that she had drowned herself in the Seine, or she had drunk herself to death. </p> <p>It was the BBC which found her, when they were preparing to broadcast an adaptation of Good Morning, Midnight. They advertised for information about \"the late Jean Rhys\", and she answered. Learning of this, we wrote to her, and she replied, saying that she was working on a new book. Responding to our enthusiasm, Andr\u00e9 Deutsch - Andre's second publishing house, which he set up in 1952 with me as partner - agreed that we should buy the option to see it - for \u00a325. </p> <p>When people exclaim at how mean this was I no longer blush, simply because I have blushed so often. I tell myself that the pound bought much more in the 50s than it does now, which is true; that this was not, after all, an advance, only an advance on an advance, which is true; and that no one else in those days would have paid much more for an option, and that, too, is true. But it is inconceivable that anyone would have paid less - so mean it was. If we had known anything about Jean's circumstances I am sure that we would have fought for more, but it would be a long time before we gained any idea of them. </p> <p>The trouble was, she kept up a gallant front. In the letters we exchanged between 1957, when she said that her book would be finished in \"six or nine months\", and March 1966, when she announced that it was finished, she would refer to being held up by domestic disasters such as leaking pipes, or mice in the kitchen, and she would make the disasters sound funny. Not until I met her did I understand that for Jean such incidents were appalling: they knocked her right out because her inability to cope with life's practicalities went beyond anything I ever saw in anyone generally taken to be sane. Max's health had given out, but her loyalty to him extended beyond keeping silent about his prison sentence to disguising his subsequent helplessness. It was years before I learnt how dreadful her 70s had been as she alternated between the struggle to nurse him and bleak loneliness when he was in hospital. She ate too little, drank too much, was frightened, exhausted and ill - and paranoid into the bargain, seeing their village of Cheriton Fitzpaine, as a cruel place. </p> <p>For example: she told me that neighbours were saying that she was a witch, and she told it lightly, so that I thought she was making a funny story out of some small incident. But Mr Woodward, the rector, was to say that indeed she had been so accused, and that anyone who thought such beliefs were extinct didn't know Devon. Jean, driven frantic, had run out into the road and attacked the woman who originated the charge with a pair of scissors, which led to her being bundled for a week or so into a mental hospital. \"And if you ask me,\" said Mr Greenslade, one of her few friends in the village, \"it was the other one who ought to have been shut up, not poor Mrs Hamer [Rhys].\" And not a word of all that appeared in her letters. </p> <p>Good publishers are supposed to \"discover\" writers, and perhaps they do. To me, however, they just happened to come. Through friends and colleagues <strong> VS (Vidia) Naipaul</strong> came to a coffee bar near our office and handed me Miguel Street. </p> <p>I was delighted by it, and we bought it. Vidia and I began to meet fairly often, and I enjoyed his company because he talked well about writing and people, and was often funny. At quite an early meeting he said gravely that when he was up at Oxford - which he had not liked - he once did a thing so terrible that he would never be able to tell anyone what it was. I said it was unforgivable to reveal that much without revealing more, especially to someone like me who didn't consider even murder literally unspeakable, but I couldn't shift him and never learnt what the horror was - though someone told me later that when he was at Oxford Vidia did have some kind of nervous breakdown. </p> <p>I did not fail to see the obvious delicacy of his nervous system. Because of it I was often worried by his lack of money, and was appalled on his behalf when I once saw him risk losing a commission by defying the Times Literary Supplement. They had offered their usual fee of \u00a325 (or was it guineas?) for a review, and he had replied haughtily that he wrote nothing for less than 50. \"Oh silly Vidia,\" I thought, \"now they'll never offer him anything again.\" But lo! they paid him his 50 and I was filled with admiration. </p> <p>I cannot remember how long it was - certainly several months, perhaps even a year - before I learnt that Vidia was married. \"I have found a new flat,\" he would say; \"I saw such-and-such a film last week\"; \"My landlady says\": not once had he used the words \"we\" or \"our\". I had taken it for granted that he lived in industrious loneliness, which had seemed sad. So when at a party I glimpsed him at the far end of a room with a young woman - an inconspicuously, even mousily pretty young woman - and soon afterwards saw him leaving with her, I was pleased that he had found a girlfriend. The next time he came to the office I asked who she was - and was astounded when he answered, in a rather cross voice, \"My wife, of course.\" </p> <p>After that Pat was allowed to creep out of the shadows, but only a little: and one day she said something that shocked me so much that I know for certain that I am remembering it word-for-word. I must have remarked on our not meeting earlier, and she replied: \"Vidia doesn't like me to come to parties because I'm such a bore.\" </p> <p>From that moment on, whenever I needed to cheer myself up by counting my blessings, I used to tell myself, \"At least I'm not married to Vidia.\" </p> <p>It did not exactly turn me against him, I suppose because from the beginning I had thought of him as an interesting person to watch rather than as a friend. The flow of interest between us had always been one-way - I can't remember ever telling him anything about my own affairs, or wanting to - so this odd business of his marriage was something extra to watch rather than something repellent. Had he ever loved her - or did he still love her in some twisted way? They had married while he was at Oxford: had he done it out of loneliness, to enlarge the minuscule territory he could call his own now that he was out in the world? Or was it because she could keep him? She was working as a teacher and continued to do so well into their marriage. Or was it to shelter him from other women? He had once asked a man of my acquaintance: \"Do you know any fast women?\", which my friend found funny but which seemed touching to me. </p> <p>As did Vidia's only attempt to make a pass at me. Pat was away and I had asked him to supper. Without warning he got to his feet, came across the room and tried to kiss me as I was coming through the door carrying a tray loaded with glasses. It hardly seemed necessary to put into words the rebuff which most of him was clearly anxious for, but to be on the safe side I did. Our friendship, I said gently, was too valuable to complicate in any way - and his face brightened with relief. That someone so lacking in sexual experience and so puritanical should have to resort to prostitutes (as he told the New Yorker in 1994, and as a passage in The Mimic Men suggests) is natural; though I guess he did so infrequently, and with distaste. </p> <p>In A Way In The World, writing (as usual) as though he were a single man, Vidia described himself as \"incomplete\" in \"physical attractiveness, love, sexual fulfilment\". How terrible for a wife to be publicly wiped out in this way! Everyone who knew the Naipauls said how sorry they were for Pat, and I was sorry for her, too. But whatever Vidia's reason for marrying, he cannot have foreseen what their marriage, for whatever reason, was going to be like. He, too, probably deserved commiseration. </p> <p>When his Argentinian friend Margaret first came to London he brought her to lunch with me. She was a lively, elegant woman who, though English by descent, was \"feminine\" in the Latin-American style, sexy and teasing, with the appearance of having got him just where she wanted him. And he glowed with pride and pleasure. Afterwards he said he was thinking of leaving Pat, and when I was dismayed (could she exist without him?) said that the thought of giving up \"carnal pleasure\" just when he'd discovered it was too painful to bear. Why not stay married and have an affair, I asked; which he appeared to think an unseemly suggestion, although it was what he then did for many years. What happened later I don't know, but in the early years of their relationship there was no sign of his squashing Margaret. He did, however, make one disconcerting remark. Did I not find it interesting, he asked, that there was so much cruelty in sex? </p> <p>In 1975 we received the 13th of his books - his eighth work of fiction - Guerrillas. For the first time I was slightly apprehensive because he had spoken to me about the experience of writing it in an unprecedented way: usually he kept the process private, but this time he said that it was extraordinary, something that had never happened before: it was as though the book had been given to him. Such a feeling about writing does not necessarily bode well. And as it turned out, I could not like the book. </p> <p>The characters did not live; and the woman lived less than the man because that is true of all Vidia's women. </p> <p>We have now reached the second of my two shocking failures as an editor (I don't intend ever to confess the other one). From the professional point of view there was no question as to what I ought to do: this was one of our most valuable authors; even if his book had been really bad rather than just flawed we would certainly have published it in the expectation that he would soon be back on form; so what I must say was \"wonderful\" and damn' well sound as though I meant it. </p> <p>Instead I sat there muttering: \"Oh my God, what am I going to say to him?\" I had never lied to him - I kept reminding myself of that, disregarding the fact that I had never before needed to lie. \"If I lie now, how will he be able to trust me in the future when I praise something?\" The obvious answer to that was that if I lied convincingly he would never know that I had done it, but this did not occur to me. After what seemed to me like hours of sincere angst I ended by persuading myself that I \"owed it to our friendship\" to tell him what I truly thought.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One day in 1944, my housemate and I were having a party, and our friend George brought Andr\u00e9 Deutsch. Andr\u00e9, a Hungarian the same age as I was (26), had come to England to study economics, had been caught by the war, and had been interned as an enemy alien on the Isle of Man. The Hungarians were soon let out on condition that they reported regularly to the authorities, and Andr\u00e9 now worked for the publishers Nicolson and Watson. His being the first person I had ever met who was \"in publishing\" was enough to exalt him in my eyes. He was small, trim and good-looking in a boyish way. I remember thinking that his mouth was as fresh and soft-looking as a child's, and being surprised that I found it attractive - usually I liked my men on the rugged side. He sat on the floor and sang The Foggy, Foggy Dew, which was unexpected in a Hungarian, and charming, so that I was more aware of him than of anyone else in the room. Two days later, when he asked me to dinner and a theatre, I was gratified. After the theatre, we ate an omelette and went to bed together, without - as I remember it - much excitement on either side. In old age I can still remember the matchless intoxication of falling in love (which may well be a neurotic condition, but still nothing else lights up the whole of one's being in that way) and the more common but no less delicious sensations of a powerful physical attraction; but I have gone blurry about the kind of affair I had with Andr\u00e9. I wonder what took me into such affairs, and what held me in them, almost always, until the man moved on. Rather than remembering, I have to work it out. It was not thinking myself in love when I was not - I was too clear-sighted for that. And it was not simply the nesting instinct, because I was romantic enough (or perhaps realist enough?) to be sure that I couldn't marry a man I didn't love. To start with it was probably curiosity - a cat-like impulse to poke my nose round the next corner - combined with the emptiness of my emotional life at the time: this would at least seem to fill it. And once it had got going . . . well, perhaps the nesting instinct did start to come into it, after all. Although I knew from experience that whenever I genuinely fell in love it happened almost on sight, perhaps in this other kind of affair I allowed myself to slide into a vague hope that this time, given the chance, love might develop. And anyway I was pleased to be wanted; I liked the social and erotic occupations involved; I enjoyed being fond of someone; and I continued to be moved by curiosity. Quite early in my career the image of a glass-bottomed boat came to me as an apt one for sex; a love-making relationship with a man offered chances to peer at what went on under his surface. It was soon apparent that Andr\u00e9 and I would not be lovers for long. I felt that I could have enjoyed making love with him if he had been more enthusiastic about making love with me, and given my essential coldness since the shock of losing the man I really wanted - the man I was engaged to, who was serving in the Middle East, had first gone silent on me, then married someone else, then been killed - he probably felt the same about me: less than adequate grounds for an affair. And he was an insomniac whose bed, though a double one, was not wide. When I wanted to sleep, he wanted to sit up and read the Times, and what he wanted to do he did, with much uninhibited rustling: it was his house, his bed - and insomnia commands respect while somnolence is boring. Englishwomen are notorious for somnolence, he told me tetchily. He often remarked on the shortcomings of the English as lovers, a habit shared by many continental men with a touching failure to see how easily it can provoke the bitten-back response, \"Who are you to talk?\" Rather than enjoying the dozen or so nights we spent together, we went through them \"because they were there\", and the only sadness I felt when he moved on to another bedfellow was the knee-jerk reaction, \"There you are, you see - you're unable to keep anyone.\" Understanding that I owed this droopy feeling to the fianc\u00e9 who had jilted me, I didn't hold it against Andr\u00e9. It turned out that the slightness of our affair did not matter because - mystifyingly, given how unlike we are in temperament - we had ended it as friends. We continued to meet, I became his confidante about his love-life, and he introduced me to his other friends. Before long, a feeling of being \"family\" grew up between Andr\u00e9 and me. It was this feeling which made it natural for us both to expect me to be involved in his plans when he decided that he would start a publishing house as soon as the war ended . . . not that my own expectations, to begin with, were anything but provisional. He had no money and no connections: how could he possibly start a publishing house? It was like someone saying, \"When I win the football pools.\" But of course if he did win them, I would want to be in on it. While Andr\u00e9 was with [the publishing firm] Nicolson and Watson, George Orwell submitted Animal Farm to them and John Roberts, the managing director, asked Andr\u00e9 to read it for him. Andr\u00e9 declared it wonderful, but Roberts, when he heard what it was about, said: \"Nonsense, laddie - no one nowadays wants to make fun of Uncle Joe.\" Andr\u00e9, who was determined to help the penniless and modest Orwell whom he saw as almost saint-like, decided that Jonathan Cape was the right publisher for him, and Orwell took his advice. Cape accepted the book, but shared Roberts's doubts to the extent of making a condition: it must be checked by some sort of official authority to make sure that it was not considered damaging to the war effort. And it was so considered: His Majesty's Government sincerely hoped that Mr Cape would refrain from publishing something so sharply critical of our Soviet Ally - and Mr Cape did refrain. Orwell, who by this time was getting pretty desperate and who knew that Andr\u00e9 was planning to start his own firm as soon as he could raise a little capital, then said to Andr\u00e9: \"Look, why don't you do it? Why don't you start off your firm with it?' And Andr\u00e9, strongly tempted to pounce but still far from sure that he would be able to start a firm however much he wanted to, felt that he must not let a man he liked and respected so deeply take such a risk. No, he said. And the essential resilience of his nature was later to be well illustrated by the fact that the more famous Animal Farm became, the prouder he was of his own early recognition of it and of his not letting Orwell take the risk of giving it to him, with never a moan at having lost this prize. Andr\u00e9 started his first publishing house, Allan Wingate, late in 1945; I was his employee, an editor. The most important book in the history of Allan Wingate was Norman Mailer's first novel, The Naked And The Dead, which came to us from an agent desperate because six of London's leading publishers had rejected it in spite of its crossing the Atlantic on a wave of excitement (it was one of those books, always American at that time, which are mysteriously preceded by a certainty that they will cause a stir). Our list had gained substance and our sales organisation was seen to be good, but we were still too small to be any agent's first choice for a big book - or indeed even their seventh choice, had they not concluded that none of the more firmly established houses was going to make an offer. The book was a war novel, all its characters soldiers going through hell in the Pacific, where Mailer himself had served. He was bent on conveying the nature of these soldiers and their experiences accurately, so naturally he wanted the men in his novel to speak like the men he had known, which meant using the words \"fuck\" and \"fucking\", and using them often. His American publishers had told him that although they knew it to be a great book, they could not publish it, and nor would anyone else (which appeared to be true) with those words spelt out. I believe the use of \"f-\" was suggested; but \"fuck\" and \"fucking\" occurred so often that this would have made the dialogue look like fish-net, so \"fug\" and \"fugging\" were agreed as substitutes. It might be argued that the six English publishers who rejected the book because of the obscenity of its language were less ridiculous than the American publisher who accepted this solution. Given the premise from which they were all working, that \"fuck\" was unprintably obscene, how could another word which sounded so nearly the same, and which was loaded with the same meaning, not be equally obscene? There has never, I think, been a clearer demonstration of the idiocy of making words taboo. We, of course, pounced. It is many years since I re-read the book and much of it is now hazy in my mind, but I still have a strong memory of a passage in which exhausted men are struggling to manhandle a gun out of deep mud, which makes me think that I was right in feeling that it was very good - a book which had genuinely expanded the range of my imagination. We wanted to restore the \"fucks\" but dared not; and as it turned out we were right not to dare. Review copies went out to the press about three weeks before publication, and the literary editor of the Sunday Times left his lying about in his office. The newspaper's editor, who was an old man nearing retirement, ambled in and chanced to pick it up and open it. The first thing to meet his eye was \"fug\" . . . followed by \"fug\" and \"fug\" again. So that Sunday, on the paper's front page, there appeared a short but furious protest, written by the editor himself, against the projected publication of a book so vile that (and he truly did use these words) \"no decent man could leave it where his women or children might happen to see it\". As always on a Sunday I was sleeping late, so I was cross when I had to answer the front-door bell at eight-thirty. There stood Andr\u00e9, unshaven, a pair of trousers and a macintosh pulled on over his pyjamas, and a copy of the Sunday Times in his hand. \"Read this!\" \"Oh my God!\" I was as alarmed as he was. The book was printed and bound - the first printing was large - it was a long book, expensive to manufacture . . . close to the wind as the firm was still having to sail, if this book was banned we would go down. \"Hurry and get some clothes on,\" said Andr\u00e9. \"We must rush a copy to Desmond McCarthy - I've got his address.\" McCarthy was the most influential reviewer then writing. We scribbled a note begging him to read the book at once and to say publicly that it was not obscene, then we set off to push it through his letter-box. To insist on seeing him so early on a Sunday morning might, we felt, put him off. In retrospect, the chief value of our outing was that it was something to do in this nerve-racking situation: I don't think that McCarthy's eventual response can have been more than civil, or I would not have forgotten it. Next morning orders started pouring into the office, and only then did it occur to us that if we were not heading for disaster, it might be a triumph. Meanwhile we were instantly served with an injunction against publishing The Naked And The Dead until the Attorney General, Sir Hartley Shawcross, had considered the case and had given us permission to do so (if he did). Whether the injunction was handed over by the large and apparently amiable police detective who spent the morning questioning us all, or whether it came separately, I do not know. During the next two or three weeks the flood of orders nearly submerged us, the frustration of not being able to supply them became acute, and the encouragement we received from everyone we knew began to make triumph seem more likely than disaster. Finally Andr\u00e9 persuaded an MP of his acquaintance to ask a question in the House of Commons about the book's fate: was the Attorney General going to ban it or not? The answer was no - a rather grudging one in that Shawcross said that he thought it was a bad book, but still no. So we were off - into, ironically, quite worrying financial problems, because we were hard put to it to pay for the several reprints we had to order. What we gained from this adventure was more than a good and best-selling novel; more, even, than the presence of Norman Mailer on our list from then on. Overnight we began to be seen as a brave and dashing little firm, worth serious attention from agents handling interesting new writers, and Andr\u00e9's welcome when he visited New York became even more richly rewarding. The poet Stevie Smith found life difficult; although she solved the problem cleverly and decisively by withdrawing from those parts of it that were too much for her and keeping to a well-defined territory of her own. She was amusing, and - strangely, given the cautious nature of her strategy - met one with a beguiling openness, so that I always started our meetings with the feeling that we were about to become close friends. We never did, and I think the reason was sexual. I was still young enough to be at heart more interested in my own sexual and romantic activities than in anything else (though mostly I kept them out of my office life), so Stevie's nervous asexuality distanced her. She almost fainted when she first came into my office, because I had on my wall a print of snakes. All the blood left her face and she could hardly make audible a plea that I should take the print down (after that I always removed it as soon as she was announced). Perhaps the notion that a phobia about snakes relates to their phallic quality is old-fashioned and misguided, but I supposed it to be true, and saw Stevie's phobia as revealing. I'm sorry to say that some part of me slightly despised the fear of sex I sensed in her; and I hope that she got her own back (this is far from unlikely) by slightly despising its opposite quality in me. We were lucky enough to publish Philip Roth's first books and almost all of John Updike's. Roth, even more than Mailer, was a writer whose fame preceded his work: when his very gifted little first novel, Goodbye, Columbus, crossed the Atlantic it was all but invisible for the haze of desirability surrounding it, so that no one doubted for a moment that we had made a valuable catch. Then came Letting Go, which I thought wonderful, although I agreed with Andr\u00e9 that it was too long - not \"by a third\", as he said, but still too long. So we asked each other whether we should raise the matter with Philip and agreed that it would be too dangerous; there was such a buzz going on about him, everyone was after him - annoy him and he would be gone in a flash. And anyway it would be difficult to cut because it was all so good - there was not a dead line in it. Much of that novel is dialogue and I got the impression that Philip's brilliance with dialogue had gone to his head: he had enjoyed doing it so much that he couldn't bring himself to stop. So we accepted it as it was and it didn't earn its advance. (Imagine my feelings when he said to me, several years later: \"The trouble with Letting Go is that it's far too long.\") Then came a novel called When She Was Good, told from the point of view of a young woman from the Middle West, non-Jewish, who struck me as being pretty obviously Philip's first wife. I never talked to him about this book, so what I say here is no more than my hunch, but I thought, \"This is an exercise - he is trying to prove to himself that he doesn't have to write as a Jew and a man.\" And as I read I kept telling myself, \"It must soon come alive - it must.\" And it didn't. So we thought, \"No more silly money\", and decided to calculate the advance on precisely what we reckoned the book would sell - which I think was 4,000 copies at the best - and that was not accepted. As far as I know, When She Was Good was not a success - but the next novel Philip wrote was Portnoy's Complaint. This space represents a tactful silence. John Updike , on the other hand, was never set up as a star and never disappointed. From a publisher's point of view he was a perfect author: an extremely good writer who knows his own worth but is also well-informed about the realities of publishing and bookselling. And he is an exceptionally agreeable man, interesting, amusing and unpretentious, who knows how to guard his privacy without being unfriendly. I like John very much, always enjoyed meeting him, and never felt inclined to speculate about whatever he chose to keep to himself, so I have nothing to say about him except the obvious fact that we would have been a much less distinguished publishing house without him. No one who has read Jean Rhys's first four novels can suppose that she was good at life; but no one who never met her could know how very bad at it she was. I started corresponding with her in 1957; but I didn't meet her until 1964; and as a result I did almost nothing to help her during a long period of excruciating difficulty. It was not, perhaps, her very worst time. That must have been the last three years of the 40s, when she and her third husband, Max Hamer, were living at Beckenham in Kent, their money had run out, and Max, a retired naval officer, became so desperate that he stumbled into trouble which ended in a three-year prison sentence for trying to obtain money by fraudulent means. During that nightmare Jean, paralysed by depression, could do nothing but drink herself into a state so bad that she, too, was several times in court and once in jail. By the time we were in touch Max had served his sentence, they had crept away to a series of miserable lodgings in Cornwall, and Jean was no longer quite at rock-bottom; but she still had nine terribly difficult years ahead of her before re-emerging as a writer. She had always been a private person, but she was known in literary circles when her fourth novel, Good Morning, Midnight, came out in 1939. When the war began a lot of people \"disappeared\" in that they were carried away from their natural habitat on joining the forces or taking up war-work. Jean followed her second husband out of London, so when he died, and she slithered with Max into their misfortunes, she was no longer in touch with former acquaintances and became \"lost\". It was said that she had drowned herself in the Seine, or she had drunk herself to death. It was the BBC which found her, when they were preparing to broadcast an adaptation of Good Morning, Midnight. They advertised for information about \"the late Jean Rhys\", and she answered. Learning of this, we wrote to her, and she replied, saying that she was working on a new book. Responding to our enthusiasm, Andr\u00e9 Deutsch - Andre's second publishing house, which he set up in 1952 with me as partner - agreed that we should buy the option to see it - for \u00a325. When people exclaim at how mean this was I no longer blush, simply because I have blushed so often. I tell myself that the pound bought much more in the 50s than it does now, which is true; that this was not, after all, an advance, only an advance on an advance, which is true; and that no one else in those days would have paid much more for an option, and that, too, is true. But it is inconceivable that anyone would have paid less - so mean it was. If we had known anything about Jean's circumstances I am sure that we would have fought for more, but it would be a long time before we gained any idea of them. The trouble was, she kept up a gallant front. In the letters we exchanged between 1957, when she said that her book would be finished in \"six or nine months\", and March 1966, when she announced that it was finished, she would refer to being held up by domestic disasters such as leaking pipes, or mice in the kitchen, and she would make the disasters sound funny. Not until I met her did I understand that for Jean such incidents were appalling: they knocked her right out because her inability to cope with life's practicalities went beyond anything I ever saw in anyone generally taken to be sane. Max's health had given out, but her loyalty to him extended beyond keeping silent about his prison sentence to disguising his subsequent helplessness. It was years before I learnt how dreadful her 70s had been as she alternated between the struggle to nurse him and bleak loneliness when he was in hospital. She ate too little, drank too much, was frightened, exhausted and ill - and paranoid into the bargain, seeing their village of Cheriton Fitzpaine, as a cruel place. For example: she told me that neighbours were saying that she was a witch, and she told it lightly, so that I thought she was making a funny story out of some small incident. But Mr Woodward, the rector, was to say that indeed she had been so accused, and that anyone who thought such beliefs were extinct didn't know Devon. Jean, driven frantic, had run out into the road and attacked the woman who originated the charge with a pair of scissors, which led to her being bundled for a week or so into a mental hospital. \"And if you ask me,\" said Mr Greenslade, one of her few friends in the village, \"it was the other one who ought to have been shut up, not poor Mrs Hamer [Rhys].\" And not a word of all that appeared in her letters. Good publishers are supposed to \"discover\" writers, and perhaps they do. To me, however, they just happened to come. Through friends and colleagues VS (Vidia) Naipaul came to a coffee bar near our office and handed me Miguel Street. I was delighted by it, and we bought it. Vidia and I began to meet fairly often, and I enjoyed his company because he talked well about writing and people, and was often funny. At quite an early meeting he said gravely that when he was up at Oxford - which he had not liked - he once did a thing so terrible that he would never be able to tell anyone what it was. I said it was unforgivable to reveal that much without revealing more, especially to someone like me who didn't consider even murder literally unspeakable, but I couldn't shift him and never learnt what the horror was - though someone told me later that when he was at Oxford Vidia did have some kind of nervous breakdown. I did not fail to see the obvious delicacy of his nervous system. Because of it I was often worried by his lack of money, and was appalled on his behalf when I once saw him risk losing a commission by defying the Times Literary Supplement. They had offered their usual fee of \u00a325 (or was it guineas?) for a review, and he had replied haughtily that he wrote nothing for less than 50. \"Oh silly Vidia,\" I thought, \"now they'll never offer him anything again.\" But lo! they paid him his 50 and I was filled with admiration. I cannot remember how long it was - certainly several months, perhaps even a year - before I learnt that Vidia was married. \"I have found a new flat,\" he would say; \"I saw such-and-such a film last week\"; \"My landlady says\": not once had he used the words \"we\" or \"our\". I had taken it for granted that he lived in industrious loneliness, which had seemed sad. So when at a party I glimpsed him at the far end of a room with a young woman - an inconspicuously, even mousily pretty young woman - and soon afterwards saw him leaving with her, I was pleased that he had found a girlfriend. The next time he came to the office I asked who she was - and was astounded when he answered, in a rather cross voice, \"My wife, of course.\" After that Pat was allowed to creep out of the shadows, but only a little: and one day she said something that shocked me so much that I know for certain that I am remembering it word-for-word. I must have remarked on our not meeting earlier, and she replied: \"Vidia doesn't like me to come to parties because I'm such a bore.\" From that moment on, whenever I needed to cheer myself up by counting my blessings, I used to tell myself, \"At least I'm not married to Vidia.\" It did not exactly turn me against him, I suppose because from the beginning I had thought of him as an interesting person to watch rather than as a friend. The flow of interest between us had always been one-way - I can't remember ever telling him anything about my own affairs, or wanting to - so this odd business of his marriage was something extra to watch rather than something repellent. Had he ever loved her - or did he still love her in some twisted way? They had married while he was at Oxford: had he done it out of loneliness, to enlarge the minuscule territory he could call his own now that he was out in the world? Or was it because she could keep him? She was working as a teacher and continued to do so well into their marriage. Or was it to shelter him from other women? He had once asked a man of my acquaintance: \"Do you know any fast women?\", which my friend found funny but which seemed touching to me. As did Vidia's only attempt to make a pass at me. Pat was away and I had asked him to supper. Without warning he got to his feet, came across the room and tried to kiss me as I was coming through the door carrying a tray loaded with glasses. It hardly seemed necessary to put into words the rebuff which most of him was clearly anxious for, but to be on the safe side I did. Our friendship, I said gently, was too valuable to complicate in any way - and his face brightened with relief. That someone so lacking in sexual experience and so puritanical should have to resort to prostitutes (as he told the New Yorker in 1994, and as a passage in The Mimic Men suggests) is natural; though I guess he did so infrequently, and with distaste. In A Way In The World, writing (as usual) as though he were a single man, Vidia described himself as \"incomplete\" in \"physical attractiveness, love, sexual fulfilment\". How terrible for a wife to be publicly wiped out in this way! Everyone who knew the Naipauls said how sorry they were for Pat, and I was sorry for her, too. But whatever Vidia's reason for marrying, he cannot have foreseen what their marriage, for whatever reason, was going to be like. He, too, probably deserved commiseration. When his Argentinian friend Margaret first came to London he brought her to lunch with me. She was a lively, elegant woman who, though English by descent, was \"feminine\" in the Latin-American style, sexy and teasing, with the appearance of having got him just where she wanted him. And he glowed with pride and pleasure. Afterwards he said he was thinking of leaving Pat, and when I was dismayed (could she exist without him?) said that the thought of giving up \"carnal pleasure\" just when he'd discovered it was too painful to bear. Why not stay married and have an affair, I asked; which he appeared to think an unseemly suggestion, although it was what he then did for many years. What happened later I don't know, but in the early years of their relationship there was no sign of his squashing Margaret. He did, however, make one disconcerting remark. Did I not find it interesting, he asked, that there was so much cruelty in sex? In 1975 we received the 13th of his books - his eighth work of fiction - Guerrillas. For the first time I was slightly apprehensive because he had spoken to me about the experience of writing it in an unprecedented way: usually he kept the process private, but this time he said that it was extraordinary, something that had never happened before: it was as though the book had been given to him. Such a feeling about writing does not necessarily bode well. And as it turned out, I could not like the book. The characters did not live; and the woman lived less than the man because that is true of all Vidia's women. We have now reached the second of my two shocking failures as an editor (I don't intend ever to confess the other one). From the professional point of view there was no question as to what I ought to do: this was one of our most valuable authors; even if his book had been really bad rather than just flawed we would certainly have published it in the expectation that he would soon be back on form; so what I must say was \"wonderful\" and damn' well sound as though I meant it. Instead I sat there muttering: \"Oh my God, what am I going to say to him?\" I had never lied to him - I kept reminding myself of that, disregarding the fact that I had never before needed to lie. \"If I lie now, how will he be able to trust me in the future when I praise something?\" The obvious answer to that was that if I lied convincingly he would never know that I had done it, but this did not occur to me. After what seemed to me like hours of sincere angst I ended by persuading myself that I \"owed it to our friendship\" to tell him what I truly thought.",

I could still like his work, I could still be sorry for his pain; but I no longer faced the task of fashioning affection out of these elements in order to deal as a good editor should with the exhausting, and finally tedious, task of listening to his woe. \"Do you know what,\" I said to Andr\u00e9, \"I've begun to see that it's a release.\" \u0095 Copyright \u00a9 2000 Diana Athill.

      "body": "<p>One day in 1944, my housemate and I were having a party, and our friend George brought <strong> Andr\u00e9 Deutsch</strong>. Andr\u00e9, a Hungarian the same age as I was (26), had come to England to study economics, had been caught by the war, and had been interned as an enemy alien on the Isle of Man. The Hungarians were soon let out on condition that they reported regularly to the authorities, and Andr\u00e9 now worked for the publishers Nicolson and Watson. His being the first person I had ever met who was \"in publishing\" was enough to exalt him in my eyes. </p> <p>He was small, trim and good-looking in a boyish way. I remember thinking that his mouth was as fresh and soft-looking as a child's, and being surprised that I found it attractive - usually I liked my men on the rugged side. He sat on the floor and sang The Foggy, Foggy Dew, which was unexpected in a Hungarian, and charming, so that I was more aware of him than of anyone else in the room. Two days later, when he asked me to dinner and a theatre, I was gratified. After the theatre, we ate an omelette and went to bed together, without - as I remember it - much excitement on either side. </p> <p>In old age I can still remember the matchless intoxication of falling in love (which may well be a neurotic condition, but still nothing else lights up the whole of one's being in that way) and the more common but no less delicious sensations of a powerful physical attraction; but I have gone blurry about the kind of affair I had with Andr\u00e9. I wonder what took me into such affairs, and what held me in them, almost always, until the man moved on. Rather than remembering, I have to work it out. </p> <p>It was not thinking myself in love when I was not - I was too clear-sighted for that. And it was not simply the nesting instinct, because I was romantic enough (or perhaps realist enough?) to be sure that I couldn't marry a man I didn't love. To start with it was probably curiosity - a cat-like impulse to poke my nose round the next corner - combined with the emptiness of my emotional life at the time: this would at least seem to fill it. And once it had got going . . . well, perhaps the nesting instinct did start to come into it, after all. Although I knew from experience that whenever I genuinely fell in love it happened almost on sight, perhaps in this other kind of affair I allowed myself to slide into a vague hope that this time, given the chance, love might develop. And anyway I was pleased to be wanted; I liked the social and erotic occupations involved; I enjoyed being fond of someone; and I continued to be moved by curiosity. Quite early in my career the image of a glass-bottomed boat came to me as an apt one for sex; a love-making relationship with a man offered chances to peer at what went on under his surface. </p> <p>It was soon apparent that Andr\u00e9 and I would not be lovers for long. I felt that I could have enjoyed making love with him if he had been more enthusiastic about making love with me, and given my essential coldness since the shock of losing the man I really wanted - the man I was engaged to, who was serving in the Middle East, had first gone silent on me, then married someone else, then been killed - he probably felt the same about me: less than adequate grounds for an affair. And he was an insomniac whose bed, though a double one, was not wide. When I wanted to sleep, he wanted to sit up and read the Times, and what he wanted to do he did, with much uninhibited rustling: it was his house, his bed - and insomnia commands respect while somnolence is boring. Englishwomen are notorious for somnolence, he told me tetchily. He often remarked on the shortcomings of the English as lovers, a habit shared by many continental men with a touching failure to see how easily it can provoke the bitten-back response, \"Who are you to talk?\" Rather than enjoying the dozen or so nights we spent together, we went through them \"because they were there\", and the only sadness I felt when he moved on to another bedfellow was the knee-jerk reaction, \"There you are, you see - you're unable to keep anyone.\" Understanding that I owed this droopy feeling to the fianc\u00e9 who had jilted me, I didn't hold it against Andr\u00e9. It turned out that the slightness of our affair did not matter because - mystifyingly, given how unlike we are in temperament - we had ended it as friends. </p> <p>We continued to meet, I became his confidante about his love-life, and he introduced me to his other friends. Before long, a feeling of being \"family\" grew up between Andr\u00e9 and me. It was this feeling which made it natural for us both to expect me to be involved in his plans when he decided that he would start a publishing house as soon as the war ended . . . not that my own expectations, to begin with, were anything but provisional. He had no money and no connections: how could he possibly start a publishing house? It was like someone saying, \"When I win the football pools.\" But of course if he did win them, I would want to be in on it. </p> <p>While Andr\u00e9 was with [the publishing firm] Nicolson and Watson, <strong> George Orwell</strong> submitted Animal Farm to them and John Roberts, the managing director, asked Andr\u00e9 to read it for him. Andr\u00e9 declared it wonderful, but Roberts, when he heard what it was about, said: \"Nonsense, laddie - no one nowadays wants to make fun of Uncle Joe.\" Andr\u00e9, who was determined to help the penniless and modest Orwell whom he saw as almost saint-like, decided that Jonathan Cape was the right publisher for him, and Orwell took his advice. Cape accepted the book, but shared Roberts's doubts to the extent of making a condition: it must be checked by some sort of official authority to make sure that it was not considered damaging to the war effort. And it was so considered: His Majesty's Government sincerely hoped that Mr Cape would refrain from publishing something so sharply critical of our Soviet Ally - and Mr Cape did refrain. </p> <p>Orwell, who by this time was getting pretty desperate and who knew that Andr\u00e9 was planning to start his own firm as soon as he could raise a little capital, then said to Andr\u00e9: \"Look, why don't you do it? Why don't you start off your firm with it?' And Andr\u00e9, strongly tempted to pounce but still far from sure that he would be able to start a firm however much he wanted to, felt that he must not let a man he liked and respected so deeply take such a risk. No, he said. And the essential resilience of his nature was later to be well illustrated by the fact that the more famous Animal Farm became, the prouder he was of his own early recognition of it and of his not letting Orwell take the risk of giving it to him, with never a moan at having lost this prize. </p> <p>Andr\u00e9 started his first publishing house, Allan Wingate, late in 1945; I was his employee, an editor. The most important book in the history of Allan Wingate was <strong> Norman Mailer's </strong> first novel, The Naked And The Dead, which came to us from an agent desperate because six of London's leading publishers had rejected it in spite of its crossing the Atlantic on a wave of excitement (it was one of those books, always American at that time, which are mysteriously preceded by a certainty that they will cause a stir). Our list had gained substance and our sales organisation was seen to be good, but we were still too small to be any agent's first choice for a big book - or indeed even their seventh choice, had they not concluded that none of the more firmly established houses was going to make an offer. </p> <p>The book was a war novel, all its characters soldiers going through hell in the Pacific, where Mailer himself had served. He was bent on conveying the nature of these soldiers and their experiences accurately, so naturally he wanted the men in his novel to speak like the men he had known, which meant using the words \"fuck\" and \"fucking\", and using them often. His American publishers had told him that although they knew it to be a great book, they could not publish it, and nor would anyone else (which appeared to be true) with those words spelt out. I believe the use of \"f-\" was suggested; but \"fuck\" and \"fucking\" occurred so often that this would have made the dialogue look like fish-net, so \"fug\" and \"fugging\" were agreed as substitutes. </p> <p>It might be argued that the six English publishers who rejected the book because of the obscenity of its language were less ridiculous than the American publisher who accepted this solution. Given the premise from which they were all working, that \"fuck\" was unprintably obscene, how could another word which sounded so nearly the same, and which was loaded with the same meaning, not be equally obscene? There has never, I think, been a clearer demonstration of the idiocy of making words taboo. </p> <p>We, of course, pounced. It is many years since I re-read the book and much of it is now hazy in my mind, but I still have a strong memory of a passage in which exhausted men are struggling to manhandle a gun out of deep mud, which makes me think that I was right in feeling that it was very good - a book which had genuinely expanded the range of my imagination. We wanted to restore the \"fucks\" but dared not; and as it turned out we were right not to dare. </p> <p>Review copies went out to the press about three weeks before publication, and the literary editor of the Sunday Times left his lying about in his office. The newspaper's editor, who was an old man nearing retirement, ambled in and chanced to pick it up and open it. The first thing to meet his eye was \"fug\" . . . followed by \"fug\" and \"fug\" again. So that Sunday, on the paper's front page, there appeared a short but furious protest, written by the editor himself, against the projected publication of a book so vile that (and he truly did use these words) \"no decent man could leave it where his women or children might happen to see it\". </p> <p>As always on a Sunday I was sleeping late, so I was cross when I had to answer the front-door bell at eight-thirty. There stood Andr\u00e9, unshaven, a pair of trousers and a macintosh pulled on over his pyjamas, and a copy of the Sunday Times in his hand. </p> <p>\"Read this!\" </p> <p>\"Oh my God!\" </p> <p>I was as alarmed as he was. The book was printed and bound - the first printing was large - it was a long book, expensive to manufacture . . . close to the wind as the firm was still having to sail, if this book was banned we would go down. </p> <p>\"Hurry and get some clothes on,\" said Andr\u00e9. \"We must rush a copy to Desmond McCarthy - I've got his address.\" </p> <p>McCarthy was the most influential reviewer then writing. We scribbled a note begging him to read the book at once and to say publicly that it was not obscene, then we set off to push it through his letter-box. To insist on seeing him so early on a Sunday morning might, we felt, put him off. In retrospect, the chief value of our outing was that it was something to do in this nerve-racking situation: I don't think that McCarthy's eventual response can have been more than civil, or I would not have forgotten it. </p> <p>Next morning orders started pouring into the office, and only then did it occur to us that if we were not heading for disaster, it might be a triumph. Meanwhile we were instantly served with an injunction against publishing The Naked And The Dead until the Attorney General, Sir Hartley Shawcross, had considered the case and had given us permission to do so (if he did). Whether the injunction was handed over by the large and apparently amiable police detective who spent the morning questioning us all, or whether it came separately, I do not know. </p> <p>During the next two or three weeks the flood of orders nearly submerged us, the frustration of not being able to supply them became acute, and the encouragement we received from everyone we knew began to make triumph seem more likely than disaster. Finally Andr\u00e9 persuaded an MP of his acquaintance to ask a question in the House of Commons about the book's fate: was the Attorney General going to ban it or not? The answer was no - a rather grudging one in that Shawcross said that he thought it was a bad book, but still no. So we were off - into, ironically, quite worrying financial problems, because we were hard put to it to pay for the several reprints we had to order. </p> <p>What we gained from this adventure was more than a good and best-selling novel; more, even, than the presence of Norman Mailer on our list from then on. Overnight we began to be seen as a brave and dashing little firm, worth serious attention from agents handling interesting new writers, and Andr\u00e9's welcome when he visited New York became even more richly rewarding. </p> <p>The poet <strong> Stevie Smith</strong> found life difficult; although she solved the problem cleverly and decisively by withdrawing from those parts of it that were too much for her and keeping to a well-defined territory of her own. She was amusing, and - strangely, given the cautious nature of her strategy - met one with a beguiling openness, so that I always started our meetings with the feeling that we were about to become close friends. We never did, and I think the reason was sexual. I was still young enough to be at heart more interested in my own sexual and romantic activities than in anything else (though mostly I kept them out of my office life), so Stevie's nervous asexuality distanced her. She almost fainted when she first came into my office, because I had on my wall a print of snakes. All the blood left her face and she could hardly make audible a plea that I should take the print down (after that I always removed it as soon as she was announced). Perhaps the notion that a phobia about snakes relates to their phallic quality is old-fashioned and misguided, but I supposed it to be true, and saw Stevie's phobia as revealing. I'm sorry to say that some part of me slightly despised the fear of sex I sensed in her; and I hope that she got her own back (this is far from unlikely) by slightly despising its opposite quality in me. </p> <p>We were lucky enough to publish <strong> Philip Roth's</strong> first books and almost all of John Updike's. Roth, even more than Mailer, was a writer whose fame preceded his work: when his very gifted little first novel, Goodbye, Columbus, crossed the Atlantic it was all but invisible for the haze of desirability surrounding it, so that no one doubted for a moment that we had made a valuable catch. Then came Letting Go, which I thought wonderful, although I agreed with Andr\u00e9 that it was too long - not \"by a third\", as he said, but still too long. So we asked each other whether we should raise the matter with Philip and agreed that it would be too dangerous; there was such a buzz going on about him, everyone was after him - annoy him and he would be gone in a flash. And anyway it would be difficult to cut because it was all so good - there was not a dead line in it. Much of that novel is dialogue and I got the impression that Philip's brilliance with dialogue had gone to his head: he had enjoyed doing it so much that he couldn't bring himself to stop. So we accepted it as it was and it didn't earn its advance. (Imagine my feelings when he said to me, several years later: \"The trouble with Letting Go is that it's far too long.\") Then came a novel called When She Was Good, told from the point of view of a young woman from the Middle West, non-Jewish, who struck me as being pretty obviously Philip's first wife. I never talked to him about this book, so what I say here is no more than my hunch, but I thought, \"This is an exercise - he is trying to prove to himself that he doesn't have to write as a Jew and a man.\" And as I read I kept telling myself, \"It must soon come alive - it must.\" And it didn't. </p> <p>So we thought, \"No more silly money\", and decided to calculate the advance on precisely what we reckoned the book would sell - which I think was 4,000 copies at the best - and that was not accepted. As far as I know, When She Was Good was not a success - but the next novel Philip wrote was Portnoy's Complaint. </p> <p>This space represents a tactful silence. </p> <p> <strong> John Updike </strong> , on the other hand, was never set up as a star and never disappointed. From a publisher's point of view he was a perfect author: an extremely good writer who knows his own worth but is also well-informed about the realities of publishing and bookselling. And he is an exceptionally agreeable man, interesting, amusing and unpretentious, who knows how to guard his privacy without being unfriendly. I like John very much, always enjoyed meeting him, and never felt inclined to speculate about whatever he chose to keep to himself, so I have nothing to say about him except the obvious fact that we would have been a much less distinguished publishing house without him. </p> <p>No one who has read <strong> Jean Rhys's</strong> first four novels can suppose that she was good at life; but no one who never met her could know how very bad at it she was. I started corresponding with her in 1957; but I didn't meet her until 1964; and as a result I did almost nothing to help her during a long period of excruciating difficulty. </p> <p>It was not, perhaps, her very worst time. That must have been the last three years of the 40s, when she and her third husband, Max Hamer, were living at Beckenham in Kent, their money had run out, and Max, a retired naval officer, became so desperate that he stumbled into trouble which ended in a three-year prison sentence for trying to obtain money by fraudulent means. During that nightmare Jean, paralysed by depression, could do nothing but drink herself into a state so bad that she, too, was several times in court and once in jail. By the time we were in touch Max had served his sentence, they had crept away to a series of miserable lodgings in Cornwall, and Jean was no longer quite at rock-bottom; but she still had nine terribly difficult years ahead of her before re-emerging as a writer. </p> <p>She had always been a private person, but she was known in literary circles when her fourth novel, Good Morning, Midnight, came out in 1939. When the war began a lot of people \"disappeared\" in that they were carried away from their natural habitat on joining the forces or taking up war-work. Jean followed her second husband out of London, so when he died, and she slithered with Max into their misfortunes, she was no longer in touch with former acquaintances and became \"lost\". It was said that she had drowned herself in the Seine, or she had drunk herself to death. </p> <p>It was the BBC which found her, when they were preparing to broadcast an adaptation of Good Morning, Midnight. They advertised for information about \"the late Jean Rhys\", and she answered. Learning of this, we wrote to her, and she replied, saying that she was working on a new book. Responding to our enthusiasm, Andr\u00e9 Deutsch - Andre's second publishing house, which he set up in 1952 with me as partner - agreed that we should buy the option to see it - for \u00a325. </p> <p>When people exclaim at how mean this was I no longer blush, simply because I have blushed so often. I tell myself that the pound bought much more in the 50s than it does now, which is true; that this was not, after all, an advance, only an advance on an advance, which is true; and that no one else in those days would have paid much more for an option, and that, too, is true. But it is inconceivable that anyone would have paid less - so mean it was. If we had known anything about Jean's circumstances I am sure that we would have fought for more, but it would be a long time before we gained any idea of them. </p> <p>The trouble was, she kept up a gallant front. In the letters we exchanged between 1957, when she said that her book would be finished in \"six or nine months\", and March 1966, when she announced that it was finished, she would refer to being held up by domestic disasters such as leaking pipes, or mice in the kitchen, and she would make the disasters sound funny. Not until I met her did I understand that for Jean such incidents were appalling: they knocked her right out because her inability to cope with life's practicalities went beyond anything I ever saw in anyone generally taken to be sane. Max's health had given out, but her loyalty to him extended beyond keeping silent about his prison sentence to disguising his subsequent helplessness. It was years before I learnt how dreadful her 70s had been as she alternated between the struggle to nurse him and bleak loneliness when he was in hospital. She ate too little, drank too much, was frightened, exhausted and ill - and paranoid into the bargain, seeing their village of Cheriton Fitzpaine, as a cruel place. </p> <p>For example: she told me that neighbours were saying that she was a witch, and she told it lightly, so that I thought she was making a funny story out of some small incident. But Mr Woodward, the rector, was to say that indeed she had been so accused, and that anyone who thought such beliefs were extinct didn't know Devon. Jean, driven frantic, had run out into the road and attacked the woman who originated the charge with a pair of scissors, which led to her being bundled for a week or so into a mental hospital. \"And if you ask me,\" said Mr Greenslade, one of her few friends in the village, \"it was the other one who ought to have been shut up, not poor Mrs Hamer [Rhys].\" And not a word of all that appeared in her letters. </p> <p>Good publishers are supposed to \"discover\" writers, and perhaps they do. To me, however, they just happened to come. Through friends and colleagues <strong> VS (Vidia) Naipaul</strong> came to a coffee bar near our office and handed me Miguel Street. </p> <p>I was delighted by it, and we bought it. Vidia and I began to meet fairly often, and I enjoyed his company because he talked well about writing and people, and was often funny. At quite an early meeting he said gravely that when he was up at Oxford - which he had not liked - he once did a thing so terrible that he would never be able to tell anyone what it was. I said it was unforgivable to reveal that much without revealing more, especially to someone like me who didn't consider even murder literally unspeakable, but I couldn't shift him and never learnt what the horror was - though someone told me later that when he was at Oxford Vidia did have some kind of nervous breakdown. </p> <p>I did not fail to see the obvious delicacy of his nervous system. Because of it I was often worried by his lack of money, and was appalled on his behalf when I once saw him risk losing a commission by defying the Times Literary Supplement. They had offered their usual fee of \u00a325 (or was it guineas?) for a review, and he had replied haughtily that he wrote nothing for less than 50. \"Oh silly Vidia,\" I thought, \"now they'll never offer him anything again.\" But lo! they paid him his 50 and I was filled with admiration. </p> <p>I cannot remember how long it was - certainly several months, perhaps even a year - before I learnt that Vidia was married. \"I have found a new flat,\" he would say; \"I saw such-and-such a film last week\"; \"My landlady says\": not once had he used the words \"we\" or \"our\". I had taken it for granted that he lived in industrious loneliness, which had seemed sad. So when at a party I glimpsed him at the far end of a room with a young woman - an inconspicuously, even mousily pretty young woman - and soon afterwards saw him leaving with her, I was pleased that he had found a girlfriend. The next time he came to the office I asked who she was - and was astounded when he answered, in a rather cross voice, \"My wife, of course.\" </p> <p>After that Pat was allowed to creep out of the shadows, but only a little: and one day she said something that shocked me so much that I know for certain that I am remembering it word-for-word. I must have remarked on our not meeting earlier, and she replied: \"Vidia doesn't like me to come to parties because I'm such a bore.\" </p> <p>From that moment on, whenever I needed to cheer myself up by counting my blessings, I used to tell myself, \"At least I'm not married to Vidia.\" </p> <p>It did not exactly turn me against him, I suppose because from the beginning I had thought of him as an interesting person to watch rather than as a friend. The flow of interest between us had always been one-way - I can't remember ever telling him anything about my own affairs, or wanting to - so this odd business of his marriage was something extra to watch rather than something repellent. Had he ever loved her - or did he still love her in some twisted way? They had married while he was at Oxford: had he done it out of loneliness, to enlarge the minuscule territory he could call his own now that he was out in the world? Or was it because she could keep him? She was working as a teacher and continued to do so well into their marriage. Or was it to shelter him from other women? He had once asked a man of my acquaintance: \"Do you know any fast women?\", which my friend found funny but which seemed touching to me. </p> <p>As did Vidia's only attempt to make a pass at me. Pat was away and I had asked him to supper. Without warning he got to his feet, came across the room and tried to kiss me as I was coming through the door carrying a tray loaded with glasses. It hardly seemed necessary to put into words the rebuff which most of him was clearly anxious for, but to be on the safe side I did. Our friendship, I said gently, was too valuable to complicate in any way - and his face brightened with relief. That someone so lacking in sexual experience and so puritanical should have to resort to prostitutes (as he told the New Yorker in 1994, and as a passage in The Mimic Men suggests) is natural; though I guess he did so infrequently, and with distaste. </p> <p>In A Way In The World, writing (as usual) as though he were a single man, Vidia described himself as \"incomplete\" in \"physical attractiveness, love, sexual fulfilment\". How terrible for a wife to be publicly wiped out in this way! Everyone who knew the Naipauls said how sorry they were for Pat, and I was sorry for her, too. But whatever Vidia's reason for marrying, he cannot have foreseen what their marriage, for whatever reason, was going to be like. He, too, probably deserved commiseration. </p> <p>When his Argentinian friend Margaret first came to London he brought her to lunch with me. She was a lively, elegant woman who, though English by descent, was \"feminine\" in the Latin-American style, sexy and teasing, with the appearance of having got him just where she wanted him. And he glowed with pride and pleasure. Afterwards he said he was thinking of leaving Pat, and when I was dismayed (could she exist without him?) said that the thought of giving up \"carnal pleasure\" just when he'd discovered it was too painful to bear. Why not stay married and have an affair, I asked; which he appeared to think an unseemly suggestion, although it was what he then did for many years. What happened later I don't know, but in the early years of their relationship there was no sign of his squashing Margaret. He did, however, make one disconcerting remark. Did I not find it interesting, he asked, that there was so much cruelty in sex? </p> <p>In 1975 we received the 13th of his books - his eighth work of fiction - Guerrillas. For the first time I was slightly apprehensive because he had spoken to me about the experience of writing it in an unprecedented way: usually he kept the process private, but this time he said that it was extraordinary, something that had never happened before: it was as though the book had been given to him. Such a feeling about writing does not necessarily bode well. And as it turned out, I could not like the book. </p> <p>The characters did not live; and the woman lived less than the man because that is true of all Vidia's women. </p> <p>We have now reached the second of my two shocking failures as an editor (I don't intend ever to confess the other one). From the professional point of view there was no question as to what I ought to do: this was one of our most valuable authors; even if his book had been really bad rather than just flawed we would certainly have published it in the expectation that he would soon be back on form; so what I must say was \"wonderful\" and damn' well sound as though I meant it. </p> <p>Instead I sat there muttering: \"Oh my God, what am I going to say to him?\" I had never lied to him - I kept reminding myself of that, disregarding the fact that I had never before needed to lie. \"If I lie now, how will he be able to trust me in the future when I praise something?\" The obvious answer to that was that if I lied convincingly he would never know that I had done it, but this did not occur to me. After what seemed to me like hours of sincere angst I ended by persuading myself that I \"owed it to our friendship\" to tell him what I truly thought. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,350978,00.html\">Continued</a></p>",

Andr\u00e9, a Hungarian the same age as I was (26), had come to England to study economics, had been caught by the war, and had been interned as an enemy alien on the Isle of Man. The Hungarians were soon let out on condition that they reported regularly to the authorities, and Andr\u00e9 now worked for the publishers Nicolson and Watson. His being the first person I had ever met who was \"in publishing\" was enough to exalt him in my eyes. He was small, trim and good-looking in a boyish way. I remember thinking that his mouth was as fresh and soft-looking as a child's, and being surprised that I found it attractive - usually I liked my men on the rugged side. He sat on the floor and sang The Foggy, Foggy Dew, which was unexpected in a Hungarian, and charming, so that I was more aware of him than of anyone else in the room. Two days later, when he asked me to dinner and a theatre, I was gratified. After the theatre, we ate an omelette and went to bed together, without - as I remember it - much excitement on either side. In old age I can still remember the matchless intoxication of falling in love (which may well be a neurotic condition, but still nothing else lights up the whole of one's being in that way) and the more common but no less delicious sensations of a powerful physical attraction; but I have gone blurry about the kind of affair I had with Andr\u00e9. I wonder what took me into such affairs, and what held me in them, almost always, until the man moved on. Rather than remembering, I have to work it out. It was not thinking myself in love when I was not - I was too clear-sighted for that. And it was not simply the nesting instinct, because I was romantic enough (or perhaps realist enough?) to be sure that I couldn't marry a man I didn't love. To start with it was probably curiosity - a cat-like impulse to poke my nose round the next corner - combined with the emptiness of my emotional life at the time: this would at least seem to fill it. And once it had got going . . . well, perhaps the nesting instinct did start to come into it, after all. Although I knew from experience that whenever I genuinely fell in love it happened almost on sight, perhaps in this other kind of affair I allowed myself to slide into a vague hope that this time, given the chance, love might develop. And anyway I was pleased to be wanted; I liked the social and erotic occupations involved; I enjoyed being fond of someone; and I continued to be moved by curiosity. Quite early in my career the image of a glass-bottomed boat came to me as an apt one for sex; a love-making relationship with a man offered chances to peer at what went on under his surface. It was soon apparent that Andr\u00e9 and I would not be lovers for long. I felt that I could have enjoyed making love with him if he had been more enthusiastic about making love with me, and given my essential coldness since the shock of losing the man I really wanted - the man I was engaged to, who was serving in the Middle East, had first gone silent on me, then married someone else, then been killed - he probably felt the same about me: less than adequate grounds for an affair. And he was an insomniac whose bed, though a double one, was not wide. When I wanted to sleep, he wanted to sit up and read the Times, and what he wanted to do he did, with much uninhibited rustling: it was his house, his bed - and insomnia commands respect while somnolence is boring. Englishwomen are notorious for somnolence, he told me tetchily. He often remarked on the shortcomings of the English as lovers, a habit shared by many continental men with a touching failure to see how easily it can provoke the bitten-back response, \"Who are you to talk?\" Rather than enjoying the dozen or so nights we spent together, we went through them \"because they were there\", and the only sadness I felt when he moved on to another bedfellow was the knee-jerk reaction, \"There you are, you see - you're unable to keep anyone.\" Understanding that I owed this droopy feeling to the fianc\u00e9 who had jilted me, I didn't hold it against Andr\u00e9. It turned out that the slightness of our affair did not matter because - mystifyingly, given how unlike we are in temperament - we had ended it as friends. We continued to meet, I became his confidante about his love-life, and he introduced me to his other friends. Before long, a feeling of being \"family\" grew up between Andr\u00e9 and me. It was this feeling which made it natural for us both to expect me to be involved in his plans when he decided that he would start a publishing house as soon as the war ended . . . not that my own expectations, to begin with, were anything but provisional. He had no money and no connections: how could he possibly start a publishing house? It was like someone saying, \"When I win the football pools.\" But of course if he did win them, I would want to be in on it. While Andr\u00e9 was with [the publishing firm] Nicolson and Watson, George Orwell submitted Animal Farm to them and John Roberts, the managing director, asked Andr\u00e9 to read it for him. Andr\u00e9 declared it wonderful, but Roberts, when he heard what it was about, said: \"Nonsense, laddie - no one nowadays wants to make fun of Uncle Joe.\" Andr\u00e9, who was determined to help the penniless and modest Orwell whom he saw as almost saint-like, decided that Jonathan Cape was the right publisher for him, and Orwell took his advice. Cape accepted the book, but shared Roberts's doubts to the extent of making a condition: it must be checked by some sort of official authority to make sure that it was not considered damaging to the war effort. And it was so considered: His Majesty's Government sincerely hoped that Mr Cape would refrain from publishing something so sharply critical of our Soviet Ally - and Mr Cape did refrain. Orwell, who by this time was getting pretty desperate and who knew that Andr\u00e9 was planning to start his own firm as soon as he could raise a little capital, then said to Andr\u00e9: \"Look, why don't you do it? Why don't you start off your firm with it?' And Andr\u00e9, strongly tempted to pounce but still far from sure that he would be able to start a firm however much he wanted to, felt that he must not let a man he liked and respected so deeply take such a risk. No, he said. And the essential resilience of his nature was later to be well illustrated by the fact that the more famous Animal Farm became, the prouder he was of his own early recognition of it and of his not letting Orwell take the risk of giving it to him, with never a moan at having lost this prize. Andr\u00e9 started his first publishing house, Allan Wingate, late in 1945; I was his employee, an editor. The most important book in the history of Allan Wingate was Norman Mailer's first novel, The Naked And The Dead, which came to us from an agent desperate because six of London's leading publishers had rejected it in spite of its crossing the Atlantic on a wave of excitement (it was one of those books, always American at that time, which are mysteriously preceded by a certainty that they will cause a stir). Our list had gained substance and our sales organisation was seen to be good, but we were still too small to be any agent's first choice for a big book - or indeed even their seventh choice, had they not concluded that none of the more firmly established houses was going to make an offer. The book was a war novel, all its characters soldiers going through hell in the Pacific, where Mailer himself had served. He was bent on conveying the nature of these soldiers and their experiences accurately, so naturally he wanted the men in his novel to speak like the men he had known, which meant using the words \"fuck\" and \"fucking\", and using them often. His American publishers had told him that although they knew it to be a great book, they could not publish it, and nor would anyone else (which appeared to be true) with those words spelt out. I believe the use of \"f-\" was suggested; but \"fuck\" and \"fucking\" occurred so often that this would have made the dialogue look like fish-net, so \"fug\" and \"fugging\" were agreed as substitutes. It might be argued that the six English publishers who rejected the book because of the obscenity of its language were less ridiculous than the American publisher who accepted this solution. Given the premise from which they were all working, that \"fuck\" was unprintably obscene, how could another word which sounded so nearly the same, and which was loaded with the same meaning, not be equally obscene? There has never, I think, been a clearer demonstration of the idiocy of making words taboo. We, of course, pounced. It is many years since I re-read the book and much of it is now hazy in my mind, but I still have a strong memory of a passage in which exhausted men are struggling to manhandle a gun out of deep mud, which makes me think that I was right in feeling that it was very good - a book which had genuinely expanded the range of my imagination. We wanted to restore the \"fucks\" but dared not; and as it turned out we were right not to dare. Review copies went out to the press about three weeks before publication, and the literary editor of the Sunday Times left his lying about in his office. The newspaper's editor, who was an old man nearing retirement, ambled in and chanced to pick it up and open it. The first thing to meet his eye was \"fug\" . . . followed by \"fug\" and \"fug\" again. So that Sunday, on the paper's front page, there appeared a short but furious protest, written by the editor himself, against the projected publication of a book so vile that (and he truly did use these words) \"no decent man could leave it where his women or children might happen to see it\". As always on a Sunday I was sleeping late, so I was cross when I had to answer the front-door bell at eight-thirty. There stood Andr\u00e9, unshaven, a pair of trousers and a macintosh pulled on over his pyjamas, and a copy of the Sunday Times in his hand. \"Read this!\" \"Oh my God!\" I was as alarmed as he was. The book was printed and bound - the first printing was large - it was a long book, expensive to manufacture . . . close to the wind as the firm was still having to sail, if this book was banned we would go down. \"Hurry and get some clothes on,\" said Andr\u00e9. \"We must rush a copy to Desmond McCarthy - I've got his address.\" McCarthy was the most influential reviewer then writing. We scribbled a note begging him to read the book at once and to say publicly that it was not obscene, then we set off to push it through his letter-box. To insist on seeing him so early on a Sunday morning might, we felt, put him off. In retrospect, the chief value of our outing was that it was something to do in this nerve-racking situation: I don't think that McCarthy's eventual response can have been more than civil, or I would not have forgotten it. Next morning orders started pouring into the office, and only then did it occur to us that if we were not heading for disaster, it might be a triumph. Meanwhile we were instantly served with an injunction against publishing The Naked And The Dead until the Attorney General, Sir Hartley Shawcross, had considered the case and had given us permission to do so (if he did). Whether the injunction was handed over by the large and apparently amiable police detective who spent the morning questioning us all, or whether it came separately, I do not know. During the next two or three weeks the flood of orders nearly submerged us, the frustration of not being able to supply them became acute, and the encouragement we received from everyone we knew began to make triumph seem more likely than disaster. Finally Andr\u00e9 persuaded an MP of his acquaintance to ask a question in the House of Commons about the book's fate: was the Attorney General going to ban it or not? The answer was no - a rather grudging one in that Shawcross said that he thought it was a bad book, but still no. So we were off - into, ironically, quite worrying financial problems, because we were hard put to it to pay for the several reprints we had to order. What we gained from this adventure was more than a good and best-selling novel; more, even, than the presence of Norman Mailer on our list from then on. Overnight we began to be seen as a brave and dashing little firm, worth serious attention from agents handling interesting new writers, and Andr\u00e9's welcome when he visited New York became even more richly rewarding. The poet Stevie Smith found life difficult; although she solved the problem cleverly and decisively by withdrawing from those parts of it that were too much for her and keeping to a well-defined territory of her own. She was amusing, and - strangely, given the cautious nature of her strategy - met one with a beguiling openness, so that I always started our meetings with the feeling that we were about to become close friends. We never did, and I think the reason was sexual. I was still young enough to be at heart more interested in my own sexual and romantic activities than in anything else (though mostly I kept them out of my office life), so Stevie's nervous asexuality distanced her. She almost fainted when she first came into my office, because I had on my wall a print of snakes. All the blood left her face and she could hardly make audible a plea that I should take the print down (after that I always removed it as soon as she was announced). Perhaps the notion that a phobia about snakes relates to their phallic quality is old-fashioned and misguided, but I supposed it to be true, and saw Stevie's phobia as revealing. I'm sorry to say that some part of me slightly despised the fear of sex I sensed in her; and I hope that she got her own back (this is far from unlikely) by slightly despising its opposite quality in me. We were lucky enough to publish Philip Roth's first books and almost all of John Updike's. Roth, even more than Mailer, was a writer whose fame preceded his work: when his very gifted little first novel, Goodbye, Columbus, crossed the Atlantic it was all but invisible for the haze of desirability surrounding it, so that no one doubted for a moment that we had made a valuable catch. Then came Letting Go, which I thought wonderful, although I agreed with Andr\u00e9 that it was too long - not \"by a third\", as he said, but still too long. So we asked each other whether we should raise the matter with Philip and agreed that it would be too dangerous; there was such a buzz going on about him, everyone was after him - annoy him and he would be gone in a flash. And anyway it would be difficult to cut because it was all so good - there was not a dead line in it. Much of that novel is dialogue and I got the impression that Philip's brilliance with dialogue had gone to his head: he had enjoyed doing it so much that he couldn't bring himself to stop. So we accepted it as it was and it didn't earn its advance. (Imagine my feelings when he said to me, several years later: \"The trouble with Letting Go is that it's far too long.\") Then came a novel called When She Was Good, told from the point of view of a young woman from the Middle West, non-Jewish, who struck me as being pretty obviously Philip's first wife. I never talked to him about this book, so what I say here is no more than my hunch, but I thought, \"This is an exercise - he is trying to prove to himself that he doesn't have to write as a Jew and a man.\" And as I read I kept telling myself, \"It must soon come alive - it must.\" And it didn't. So we thought, \"No more silly money\", and decided to calculate the advance on precisely what we reckoned the book would sell - which I think was 4,000 copies at the best - and that was not accepted. As far as I know, When She Was Good was not a success - but the next novel Philip wrote was Portnoy's Complaint. This space represents a tactful silence. John Updike , on the other hand, was never set up as a star and never disappointed. From a publisher's point of view he was a perfect author: an extremely good writer who knows his own worth but is also well-informed about the realities of publishing and bookselling. And he is an exceptionally agreeable man, interesting, amusing and unpretentious, who knows how to guard his privacy without being unfriendly. I like John very much, always enjoyed meeting him, and never felt inclined to speculate about whatever he chose to keep to himself, so I have nothing to say about him except the obvious fact that we would have been a much less distinguished publishing house without him. No one who has read Jean Rhys's first four novels can suppose that she was good at life; but no one who never met her could know how very bad at it she was. I started corresponding with her in 1957; but I didn't meet her until 1964; and as a result I did almost nothing to help her during a long period of excruciating difficulty. It was not, perhaps, her very worst time. That must have been the last three years of the 40s, when she and her third husband, Max Hamer, were living at Beckenham in Kent, their money had run out, and Max, a retired naval officer, became so desperate that he stumbled into trouble which ended in a three-year prison sentence for trying to obtain money by fraudulent means. During that nightmare Jean, paralysed by depression, could do nothing but drink herself into a state so bad that she, too, was several times in court and once in jail. By the time we were in touch Max had served his sentence, they had crept away to a series of miserable lodgings in Cornwall, and Jean was no longer quite at rock-bottom; but she still had nine terribly difficult years ahead of her before re-emerging as a writer. She had always been a private person, but she was known in literary circles when her fourth novel, Good Morning, Midnight, came out in 1939. When the war began a lot of people \"disappeared\" in that they were carried away from their natural habitat on joining the forces or taking up war-work. Jean followed her second husband out of London, so when he died, and she slithered with Max into their misfortunes, she was no longer in touch with former acquaintances and became \"lost\". It was said that she had drowned herself in the Seine, or she had drunk herself to death. It was the BBC which found her, when they were preparing to broadcast an adaptation of Good Morning, Midnight. They advertised for information about \"the late Jean Rhys\", and she answered. Learning of this, we wrote to her, and she replied, saying that she was working on a new book. Responding to our enthusiasm, Andr\u00e9 Deutsch - Andre's second publishing house, which he set up in 1952 with me as partner - agreed that we should buy the option to see it - for \u00a325. When people exclaim at how mean this was I no longer blush, simply because I have blushed so often. I tell myself that the pound bought much more in the 50s than it does now, which is true; that this was not, after all, an advance, only an advance on an advance, which is true; and that no one else in those days would have paid much more for an option, and that, too, is true. But it is inconceivable that anyone would have paid less - so mean it was. If we had known anything about Jean's circumstances I am sure that we would have fought for more, but it would be a long time before we gained any idea of them. The trouble was, she kept up a gallant front. In the letters we exchanged between 1957, when she said that her book would be finished in \"six or nine months\", and March 1966, when she announced that it was finished, she would refer to being held up by domestic disasters such as leaking pipes, or mice in the kitchen, and she would make the disasters sound funny. Not until I met her did I understand that for Jean such incidents were appalling: they knocked her right out because her inability to cope with life's practicalities went beyond anything I ever saw in anyone generally taken to be sane. Max's health had given out, but her loyalty to him extended beyond keeping silent about his prison sentence to disguising his subsequent helplessness. It was years before I learnt how dreadful her 70s had been as she alternated between the struggle to nurse him and bleak loneliness when he was in hospital. She ate too little, drank too much, was frightened, exhausted and ill - and paranoid into the bargain, seeing their village of Cheriton Fitzpaine, as a cruel place. For example: she told me that neighbours were saying that she was a witch, and she told it lightly, so that I thought she was making a funny story out of some small incident. But Mr Woodward, the rector, was to say that indeed she had been so accused, and that anyone who thought such beliefs were extinct didn't know Devon. Jean, driven frantic, had run out into the road and attacked the woman who originated the charge with a pair of scissors, which led to her being bundled for a week or so into a mental hospital. \"And if you ask me,\" said Mr Greenslade, one of her few friends in the village, \"it was the other one who ought to have been shut up, not poor Mrs Hamer [Rhys].\" And not a word of all that appeared in her letters. Good publishers are supposed to \"discover\" writers, and perhaps they do. To me, however, they just happened to come. Through friends and colleagues VS (Vidia) Naipaul came to a coffee bar near our office and handed me Miguel Street. I was delighted by it, and we bought it. Vidia and I began to meet fairly often, and I enjoyed his company because he talked well about writing and people, and was often funny. At quite an early meeting he said gravely that when he was up at Oxford - which he had not liked - he once did a thing so terrible that he would never be able to tell anyone what it was. I said it was unforgivable to reveal that much without revealing more, especially to someone like me who didn't consider even murder literally unspeakable, but I couldn't shift him and never learnt what the horror was - though someone told me later that when he was at Oxford Vidia did have some kind of nervous breakdown. I did not fail to see the obvious delicacy of his nervous system. Because of it I was often worried by his lack of money, and was appalled on his behalf when I once saw him risk losing a commission by defying the Times Literary Supplement. They had offered their usual fee of \u00a325 (or was it guineas?) for a review, and he had replied haughtily that he wrote nothing for less than 50. \"Oh silly Vidia,\" I thought, \"now they'll never offer him anything again.\" But lo! they paid him his 50 and I was filled with admiration. I cannot remember how long it was - certainly several months, perhaps even a year - before I learnt that Vidia was married. \"I have found a new flat,\" he would say; \"I saw such-and-such a film last week\"; \"My landlady says\": not once had he used the words \"we\" or \"our\". I had taken it for granted that he lived in industrious loneliness, which had seemed sad. So when at a party I glimpsed him at the far end of a room with a young woman - an inconspicuously, even mousily pretty young woman - and soon afterwards saw him leaving with her, I was pleased that he had found a girlfriend. The next time he came to the office I asked who she was - and was astounded when he answered, in a rather cross voice, \"My wife, of course.\" After that Pat was allowed to creep out of the shadows, but only a little: and one day she said something that shocked me so much that I know for certain that I am remembering it word-for-word. I must have remarked on our not meeting earlier, and she replied: \"Vidia doesn't like me to come to parties because I'm such a bore.\" From that moment on, whenever I needed to cheer myself up by counting my blessings, I used to tell myself, \"At least I'm not married to Vidia.\" It did not exactly turn me against him, I suppose because from the beginning I had thought of him as an interesting person to watch rather than as a friend. The flow of interest between us had always been one-way - I can't remember ever telling him anything about my own affairs, or wanting to - so this odd business of his marriage was something extra to watch rather than something repellent. Had he ever loved her - or did he still love her in some twisted way? They had married while he was at Oxford: had he done it out of loneliness, to enlarge the minuscule territory he could call his own now that he was out in the world? Or was it because she could keep him? She was working as a teacher and continued to do so well into their marriage. Or was it to shelter him from other women? He had once asked a man of my acquaintance: \"Do you know any fast women?\", which my friend found funny but which seemed touching to me. As did Vidia's only attempt to make a pass at me. Pat was away and I had asked him to supper. Without warning he got to his feet, came across the room and tried to kiss me as I was coming through the door carrying a tray loaded with glasses. It hardly seemed necessary to put into words the rebuff which most of him was clearly anxious for, but to be on the safe side I did. Our friendship, I said gently, was too valuable to complicate in any way - and his face brightened with relief. That someone so lacking in sexual experience and so puritanical should have to resort to prostitutes (as he told the New Yorker in 1994, and as a passage in The Mimic Men suggests) is natural; though I guess he did so infrequently, and with distaste. In A Way In The World, writing (as usual) as though he were a single man, Vidia described himself as \"incomplete\" in \"physical attractiveness, love, sexual fulfilment\". How terrible for a wife to be publicly wiped out in this way! Everyone who knew the Naipauls said how sorry they were for Pat, and I was sorry for her, too. But whatever Vidia's reason for marrying, he cannot have foreseen what their marriage, for whatever reason, was going to be like. He, too, probably deserved commiseration. When his Argentinian friend Margaret first came to London he brought her to lunch with me. She was a lively, elegant woman who, though English by descent, was \"feminine\" in the Latin-American style, sexy and teasing, with the appearance of having got him just where she wanted him. And he glowed with pride and pleasure. Afterwards he said he was thinking of leaving Pat, and when I was dismayed (could she exist without him?) said that the thought of giving up \"carnal pleasure\" just when he'd discovered it was too painful to bear. Why not stay married and have an affair, I asked; which he appeared to think an unseemly suggestion, although it was what he then did for many years. What happened later I don't know, but in the early years of their relationship there was no sign of his squashing Margaret. He did, however, make one disconcerting remark. Did I not find it interesting, he asked, that there was so much cruelty in sex? In 1975 we received the 13th of his books - his eighth work of fiction - Guerrillas. For the first time I was slightly apprehensive because he had spoken to me about the experience of writing it in an unprecedented way: usually he kept the process private, but this time he said that it was extraordinary, something that had never happened before: it was as though the book had been given to him. Such a feeling about writing does not necessarily bode well. And as it turned out, I could not like the book. The characters did not live; and the woman lived less than the man because that is true of all Vidia's women. We have now reached the second of my two shocking failures as an editor (I don't intend ever to confess the other one). From the professional point of view there was no question as to what I ought to do: this was one of our most valuable authors; even if his book had been really bad rather than just flawed we would certainly have published it in the expectation that he would soon be back on form; so what I must say was \"wonderful\" and damn' well sound as though I meant it. Instead I sat there muttering: \"Oh my God, what am I going to say to him?\" I had never lied to him - I kept reminding myself of that, disregarding the fact that I had never before needed to lie. \"If I lie now, how will he be able to trust me in the future when I praise something?\" The obvious answer to that was that if I lied convincingly he would never know that I had done it, but this did not occur to me. After what seemed to me like hours of sincere angst I ended by persuading myself that I \"owed it to our friendship\" to tell him what I truly thought. Continued",

He specialised in portraits of his contemporaries and ended up painting the governors and governesses of the almshouse where he spent his penniless old age. </p> <p><strong> Subject: </strong>An unknown young man. All we know - because it says so in the upper right-hand corner - is that he was 26 years old when Hals painted him. </p> <p><strong> Distinguishing features: </strong>The Laughing Cavalier looks out at us. His upward-pointing moustache, pointy beard, shiny nose, pink cheeks and his hat - a vast abstract black disc - give him an almost insufferable vivacity. Add to this the white ruff and that drape of velvet and he is half man, half silk. And there's something uncanny about him that has made this one of the most famous portraits in the world. </p> <p>The Laughing Cavalier has been famous ever since the Victorian art collector Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford, bought this previously uncelebrated, unvalued canvas by a then-forgotten painter at auction in 1865. The painting was simply called Portrait of a Man - it got its more flamboyant title afterwards. </p> <p>What made it special in 19th-century eyes was its freely handled, spontaneous paint, its sense of being a snapshot taken in the midst of life. The speed with which it appears to have been painted appealed to the new sensibility of realism: Hals's painting style has a robustness that was exactly what Victorian painters were trying to achieve. </p> <p>The rough reportage of Hals can be seen in every glob of white, grey or gold paint. The detail of the fine lace looks from a distance like absolute precision, but turns out to be a mobile sketch. The broad, angular lines of the Cavalier's arm and the sweep of the drapery over his belly appear (illusorily) as if they had been painted in a few seconds, rapidly sketched in long strokes. The body of the Cavalier, swathed in colours, is an amplification of basic brushstrokes; you can see how Hals brushed him into life. There's something excessive about that combination of rubicund face and masses of silk and lace. He's real and not real at the same time. </p> <p>Dutch painters in the 17th century were representational: they painted the real world of burghers, their possessions, their neat houses. But these painters were also heirs to a tradition of the grotesque, the lowlands late-medieval art of Bosch and Brueghel. In this painting Hals hints at a fantastic underside to his art. The Laughing Cavalier is a man made visibly of paint. Rather than being about modern impressionistic truth, Hals's brushstrokes draw attention to the mechanics of illusion. This jolly, hearty character sharing a joke with the painter seems almost overbearingly real, yet Hals made him in the studio. Like the surreal fantasy assemblage portraits of the 16th-century painter Arcimboldo, the Laughing Cavalier has been created by Hals out of something inanimate.

      "bodyText": "\u00b7 View the work online Artist: Frans Hals (c1580-1666) was the most famous painter in Haarlem in the Dutch Golden Age. He specialised in portraits of his contemporaries and ended up painting the governors and governesses of the almshouse where he spent his penniless old age. Subject: An unknown young man. All we know - because it says so in the upper right-hand corner - is that he was 26 years old when Hals painted him. Distinguishing features: The Laughing Cavalier looks out at us. His upward-pointing moustache, pointy beard, shiny nose, pink cheeks and his hat - a vast abstract black disc - give him an almost insufferable vivacity. Add to this the white ruff and that drape of velvet and he is half man, half silk. And there's something uncanny about him that has made this one of the most famous portraits in the world. The Laughing Cavalier has been famous ever since the Victorian art collector Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford, bought this previously uncelebrated, unvalued canvas by a then-forgotten painter at auction in 1865. The painting was simply called Portrait of a Man - it got its more flamboyant title afterwards. What made it special in 19th-century eyes was its freely handled, spontaneous paint, its sense of being a snapshot taken in the midst of life. The speed with which it appears to have been painted appealed to the new sensibility of realism: Hals's painting style has a robustness that was exactly what Victorian painters were trying to achieve. The rough reportage of Hals can be seen in every glob of white, grey or gold paint. The detail of the fine lace looks from a distance like absolute precision, but turns out to be a mobile sketch. The broad, angular lines of the Cavalier's arm and the sweep of the drapery over his belly appear (illusorily) as if they had been painted in a few seconds, rapidly sketched in long strokes. The body of the Cavalier, swathed in colours, is an amplification of basic brushstrokes; you can see how Hals brushed him into life. There's something excessive about that combination of rubicund face and masses of silk and lace. He's real and not real at the same time. Dutch painters in the 17th century were representational: they painted the real world of burghers, their possessions, their neat houses. But these painters were also heirs to a tradition of the grotesque, the lowlands late-medieval art of Bosch and Brueghel. In this painting Hals hints at a fantastic underside to his art. The Laughing Cavalier is a man made visibly of paint. Rather than being about modern impressionistic truth, Hals's brushstrokes draw attention to the mechanics of illusion. This jolly, hearty character sharing a joke with the painter seems almost overbearingly real, yet Hals made him in the studio. Like the surreal fantasy assemblage portraits of the 16th-century painter Arcimboldo, the Laughing Cavalier has been created by Hals out of something inanimate. Perhaps that's the joke he is sharing with the artist, leaving us charmed yet slightly disconcerted - feeling that it is we who are being laughed at. Inspirations and influences: Hals appealed to modern painters because he removed the smooth surfaces of classic art, reducing reality to brushstrokes. You can see echoes in the broad strokes of Manet and his followers, the Impressionists. James McNeill Whistler emulated Hals in his Arrangement in Flesh Colour and Black: Portrait of Th\u00e9odore Duret, c1883. Another admirer was Van Gogh, who saw in his Dutch forerunner the expressive sensuality of his own Self-Portrait (1889). Where is it? The Wallace Collection, Hertford House, Manchester Square, London W1 (020- 7935 0687).",

But she didn't get praised for being so thrifty. Farewell Mrs Worthington, fan of Nye Bevan I hope you are warm again up there in Heaven. Several people asked me the significance of \"warm again\", not knowing that Mrs Wormington had died of hypothermia after holidaying in Mablethorpe. Tuesday, July 25 Glenn and William are on holiday from school for six weeks. What am I going to do with them? I have no funds with which to entertain them. We are only one day into the break, but William has already declared himself to be \"bored\". I told him that, when I was a lad, I entertained myself with non-stop activities. But, in truth, all I can remember doing is staring out of the window and waiting for school to begin again. Wednesday, July 26 I reluctantly drew out \u00a350 from the building society, bought a family rail ticket and took my sons to Tate Modern. No one warned me about the vast metal spider in the Turbine Hall. William is an arachnophobe and froze with fear on seeing it. He then emitted a piercing scream. An American tourist asked me if William was an \"auditory accompaniment to Louis Bourgeois's sculpture\". I said \"no\", that he was just a little boy who was scared of spiders. Thursday, July 27 Concorde is off the front pages; no British people were killed.",

      "body": "<p>A hundred years ago, Sarah Alice Young, an American missionary, was killed in the Shanxi province of China. She was stabbed to death on the banks of the Yellow River in the arms of her \"kindest and best of husbands\", John Young, a fellow American. They had been married just over a year. Sarah and John were among 180 missionaries and their families slaughtered in the summer of 1900 at the height of the peasant uprising known as the Boxer Rebellion.</p> <p>The Boxers had emerged from the drought-stricken countryside of northern China and, in June, laid siege to the foreign legations in Beijing. Soon after, the missionaries, vulnerable in their lonely \"stations\" across rural northern China, were hunted down and killed - nearly half of them in Shanxi province. One of the few to have escaped the blood-letting there was Anna Jakobsen, a Norwegian in her mid-30s, of an independent turn of mind.</p> <p>Like Sarah Young, she belonged to one of the largest bands of Protestant missionaries, the China Inland Mission (CIM), which had proselytised boldly, but often foolishly, in remote areas of China since the 1860s. She, too, was recently married but, unlike Sarah, Anna had, in the eyes of the mission, chosen the wrong sort of husband - she had married a Chinese man, Cheng Hsiao-yu, a convert to Christianity and a lay preacher. Her outraged colleagues had banished the couple to leave the province two years before the massacres - and so unwittingly saved their lives.</p> <p>Missionaries were seen by many Chinese as agents of the foreign powers that had been seeking to \"open up\" the country since Britain launched the first Opium War in 1839. Their strange religious practices were blamed for flood, drought and unexplained deaths. They were the most visible targets in the anti-foreign storm of 1900, led by the Boxer rebels.</p> <p>We still have a poor understanding of what drove hundreds of young people such as Sarah and Anna to their largely quixotic enterprise in China. The educational qualifications of the CIM evangelists varied widely, and they preached a fundamentalist view of the scriptures to bewildered, often hostile audiences. The mission's own statistics show that, after 35 years of hard work in nearly 400 \"stations\", they had baptised fewer than 13,000 converts. Committed to work in the interior of China, \"where Christ has not been named\", the CIM missionaries wore Chinese clothes and built churches in Chinese-style architecture. But they preached an uncompromising doctrine that regarded Chinese culture and tradition as the work of the devil.</p> <p>Across this deep cultural and racial chasm, Anna's marriage with Cheng Hsiao-yu was regarded by her fellow missionaries - with a few notable exceptions - as a catastrophe. \"I do not know of any blow [the] Missions in China have had the last 30 years that is nearly so serious,\" wrote Hudson Taylor, the CIM's patriarchal founder, No one foresaw the real blow that would soon hit the movement.</p> <p>The Boxers were, at the time, the latest in China's history of peasant movements, which had erupted periodically in hard times to challenge a crumbling dynasty. Their leaders won converts by practising martial arts in the market place, claiming to be possessed by local deities that gave them the power of curing the sick.</p> <p>The movement had many attractions for thousands of young peasants with little food and no work. Their adherents wore colourful uniforms with red or yellow turbans, sashes and leggings. Their ritual exercises were supposed to make them impervious to foreign bullets. They began direct attacks upon foreigners and on foreign-built railway and telegraph lines in late 1899.</p> <p>The Imperial Court was at first divided over whether to support or suppress the Boxers, but the balance tipped after the foreign powers reinforced their embassy guards in Beijing. The Manchu, or Qing, dynasty, dominated by the formidable Empress Dowager Tzu Hsi, enlisted the Boxers in a last-ditch effort to shake off the tightening grip of the western powers. Tzu Hsi had recently deposed her nephew, the young emperor Kwang-hsu, after he had defied her by launching an unsuccessful round of reforms. On June 21, 1900, the court issued a declaration of war, and the Boxers were enlisted in the government militia. This was the start of the Siege of Peking.</p> <p>In the European quarter of the city, the resident diplomats, foreign traders and bankers were able to hold out behind makeshift barricades for two months. An eight-nation allied relief force, including a British contingent, made its way from the coast, with much bickering between the rival commanders. When it lifted the siege on August 14, it proceeded to loot, kill and rape with as much ferocity as the Boxers had shown (with the difference that the Boxers looted and killed, but did not rape).</p> <p>The reforming drive of the young emperor had not been helped by the greed of the foreign powers. One country after another claimed a \"sphere of influence\" with exclusive economic rights. Germany seized Shandong province in 1898 after two of its missionaries were killed there. France gained concessions in the south; Japan in the north-east. Britain claimed the Yangtze Valley and took a 99-year-lease on the \"New Territories\", which now form part of Hong Kong. Foreign consumer goods - cotton yarns, matches, paraffin - poured in to the countryside, driving local cottage industries out of business.</p> <p>In their own way, the foreign missionaries provoked hostility, too. Their right to travel freely all over China had been won by the force of western arms in the Second Opium War of 1858-61, and local Chinese officials were supposed to give them protection - a concession some Chinese Christian converts tried to exploit for their own ends. One of the most common causes of misunderstanding was the missionaries' eagerness to rescue orphans and to baptise young children even when they were sick or dying.</p> <p>As early as 1870, an anti-foreign riot in Tianjin had been sparked by rumours that a Catholic mission was bewitching children, mutilating their bodies and extracting their hearts and eyes to make medicine. But in rural communities desperately dependent upon water for their economic survival, the most common grievance against the missionaries was that they prevented the rains from falling - and in 1900 the rains failed throughout northern China.</p> <p>\"There were special causes for a popular rising during the spring,\" wrote the American missionary author Arthur Smith. \"The drought was great, and practically universal. For the first time since the great famine of 1878, no winter wheat to speak of had been planted in any part of northern China.\" As the water famine spread, so did rumours that local Christians were poisoning the wells.</p> <p>Out in the field, the missionaries understood the danger only too well. \"Dry as powder - oppressive duststorm - God give us rain,\" one wrote in a letter home from Baoding, near Beijing, just a month before his community was wiped out by Boxers. \"That would quiet things for a moment. We can't be sure of a single day's life. Pray for us. Pray for rain.\"</p> <p>The arrival of the Germans in Shandong coincided with a disastrous flood, in which the Yellow River had burst its dikes, followed by two years of drought. It was no coincidence that the Boxer movement first emerged in this province and successfully mobilised popular anger against local Christians. Far from Beijing, in the parched countryside, the missionaries sought protection - usually in vain - from timid or hostile local officials, or hid in huts and caves. A few small groups managed to trek south, robbed and harassed by local peasants, until they reached the Yangtze River and travelled down it to safety in Shanghai.</p> <p>Shanxi's governor, Yu Hsien, had been sympathetic to the Boxers from the start. In Shanxi's provincial capital, Taiyuan, he supervised the execution of two groups of missionary families and a number of Chinese converts in the courtyard of the governor's palace, personally giving the order \"Sha!\" (Kill!).</p> <p>At their isolated station in Jizhou (now called Jixian), close to the great Hukou waterfalls on the Yellow River, Sarah and John Young were unaware of the events in Taiyuan. In a letter on July 7, 1900 - just nine days before their deaths - Sarah, who was then 29, wrote, \"We are so quiet here that we can scarcely realise the trouble you are having down there on the plain. We feel quite safe here, at least for the present.\" Very soon after, Boxer militants must have reached their rural outpost. The Youngs fled with a small group led by George McConnell from the next mission station. They headed for the Yellow River, hoping to cross to the relative safety of Shaanxi (a different province from Shanxi).</p> <p>As they neared the river, not far from the great bend where it turns east, they were overtaken by a band of soldiers claiming that they had been sent to escort them to a safer crossing place. Once there, however, the soldiers announced that they had actually come to murder them. The McConnells' son, Kenneth, seven, spoke out in childish Chinese: \"Papa bu zhun ni sha xiao Kennie\" (My daddy won't let you kill little Kennie). The soldiers, who had been paid by local gentry to do their job, were unmoved. Kenneth and his parents were dragged off their mules and despatched with a sword. Sarah and John embraced as they were killed. Their bodies were never discovered and may have been tossed into the Yellow River.</p> <p>Some of Sarah's letters home survive from her time in Jizhou. The town was \"an out of the way place back in the mountains where no cart has ever been\", she wrote. It had been \"devastated by rebellion and robbers\". There were only a few faithful Christians, and even their commitment was shaky. \"On Sunday we found out,\" wrote Sarah sadly, \"that one of the members whom John trusted and thought to be honest has for months been taking opium and is also gambling and trying to get his little-daughter-in-law's feet bound up. Some time ago, too, we found that another one [church member] is working in his fields on Sunday.\" Enforcing the Sabbath was clearly a problem in Jizhou. \"All these things weigh heavy on John, and make him look quite worn at times.\"</p> <p>Yet the couple were extremely happy in their lonely companionship. Sarah thanked God for \"a kind, loving husband\", and wondered \"why the Lord has been so good to me\". They travelled over the hills on rough roads to preach in villages composed of hillside caves. John played on a \"Melodeon\" and soon, not surprisingly, attracted large crowds. Some of them listened as he preached, but others \"paid no heed\".</p> <p>On returning home, Sarah would have to wash John's hair - the Chinese pigtail that he wore, she explained, \"catches all the dust and dirt\". Sarah referred to herself, with joking affection, as his housekeeper. John appreciated other things, too. Sarah started a letter to another sister and broke it off midway, resuming the next day with the ingenuous remark that, \"I was stopped writing on Monday by John coming in for a chat and guess the rest!\"</p> <p>Sarah was a cheerful Midwesterner, who, from her correspondence, combined religious fervour with a healthy interest in everyday life. One of 10 children, she was raised in the Amish Mennonite church. After attending a Bible institute in Kansas, she enrolled with the North American branch of the CIM, Toronto, in 1895. There, she was equipped with a Ladies Outfit List, specifying everything from flannel night-dresses, pillowcases (both white and coloured), three suits of winter underwear, tea towels and a \"hot water bag\", to needles and thread, a chamber pot, insect powder and the Good Bible Concordance. Amid all the preparations, she and her new colleagues were anxious, she wrote, \"to be off to our poor perishing Chinese, 30,000 per day die without the gospel, and we all here at home yet. It is terrible to think about it.\"</p> <p>By February 1896, she was on a riverboat on the Yangtze, putting on Chinese clothes and taking her first meal with chopsticks. After two months' language training, she was on her way on a month-long journey, by mule cart and litter, to Shanxi province. For a young American abroad for the first time, it was an exciting journey. Her pride in her Chinese dress (she was told that \"it adds wonderfully to my dignity\") and her pleasure at riding a donkey is evident. But, she hastened to add, \"I am very happy in China not because of my surroundings but because I am working for Him who left much for me [to] do.\"</p> <p>Sarah did not take long to feel the hostility of many in Shanxi, who saw the foreign missionaries as bringers of ill fate. During a dry spell in August, \"the people carried their rain god along the streets for a few days and nights making a great noise with gongs and drums. Several times in the night they stopped to pound on our street door calling out against the foreigners for keeping the rain away.\" She observed the life around her carefully, and wrote a detailed description of threshing techniques, methods of making rope and paper, and a street sawmill.</p> <p>Sarah never knew what reception she would receive on her \"itinerations\". Local inn-keepers might refuse her a room, in which case she would \"ask the Lord to lead us to a resting place\". Or there might be bugs in the bedding and opium smokers next door. \"We can tell them at once,\" she noted, \"by their deathly faces and black teeth\".</p> <p>Within a few months, Sarah was musing on marriage - but only to reject it resolutely. \"No, I am not 'looking for someone still',\" she wrote home in December 1896. \"I believe I am chosen to work without a helpmate. It seems to me a woman's work in China is so much hindered by marriage!\" Nevertheless, quite soon she met John Young at the mission centre in Lu-an where she was based, and by mid-1898 they had an understanding.</p> <p>He returned to his lonely out-station at Jizhou, and quickly passed the successive grades in the Chinese language demanded by the CIM. In February 1899, he came back \"to take me away\". Sarah was going to be married in a Chinese dress of blue satin, its sleeves faced with pale pink silk. The mission rallied round with wedding presents, including an eiderdown quilt, a hanging lamp, eight towels, a tea cosy and two large framed texts. No one had any doubt that it was a marriage made in heaven.</p> <p>The send-off given to Anna Jakobsen when she married Cheng Hsiao-yu in the teeth of the CIM's opposition was very different. Who was this resolute young Norwegian who entered in to what may have been the first marriage in China between a western woman and a Chinese man? Anna had worked in Kristiansand, a town at the southern tip of Norway, for the family of a businessman called Rasmussen, who supported the CIM with donations. Two of his daughters later became missionaries, one of them surviving a long trek to Hankou on the Yangtze River to escape the Boxers in 1900. Anna the housemaid - then in her early 20s - volunteered early on, and together with the family governess, Sophie Reuter, joined the CIM in 1884.</p> <p>They became \"pioneers in skirts\", Norway's first missionaries abroad. Anna and Sophie were sent to the remote station of Hezhou in southern Shanxi - across the hills from Jizhou, where the Youngs would be working 10 years later. They were praised for their \"lives of singular Christ-likeness and devotion\". Sophie soon married Stanley Smith, a muscular Christian from Cambridge (he had captained the university boat) who was close to Hudson Taylor.</p> <p>Anna must surely have received at least one proposal from fellow missionaries. Marriage was regarded as a stabilising influence within the mission and a solution to the loneliness of the single male. When Sophie died of typhoid in 1891, Stanley Smith remarried within two years. But Anna laboured on alone for seven years, until 1893, when she announced that she was engaged to a fellow evangelist: Cheng Hsiao-yu. Anna did not mention the word love, but chose a more subtle argument. She was determined to work in Hunan, where no foreign mission had yet penetrated. Anna believed, she said, that marriage to a Chinese would make her more acceptable in this \"hostile province\".</p> <p>On this first occasion, the male hierarchy of the CIM prevailed on Anna to think again. In the words of its standard history, she \"had not considered the repercussions upon other single girls in the Mission\". Until now, no Chinese male had looked on western women missionaries as eligible for marriage. The precedent they were setting \"would expose all the single girls to unwelcome attention by unsuitable men, if not to danger\". (In fact, far from making unmarried women missionaries more vulnerable in China, Anna's marriage to a Chinese man may even have helped to diminish popular prejudice. If the women travelled in the company of their male colleagues, they were assumed to be concubines. If they travelled on their own, they would be accused of being prostitutes.)</p> <p>Five years later, in the summer of 1898, Anna declared her intention of marrying Cheng again, and this time she would not be budged. Agitated correspondence from Shanxi to CIM headquarters in Stoke Newington, north London, reveals the reaction of most of Anna's colleagues. \"The almost universal feeling of consternation the news produced,\" wrote missionary A Hoddle to Hudson Taylor, \"was succeeded by a perfect storm of protest.\" A few colleagues rallied to Anna and Cheng's defence. Dr EH Edwards, an experienced medical missionary, and his wife had supported the couple from the start.</p> <p>A sympathetic American Baptist, DH Clapp, agreed to marry them in the house of a Chinese Christian photographer in Taiyuan. On the morning of the wedding, two opponents of the marriage from Anna's mission headquarters outside the city leapt on horseback and rode in at top speed \"to expostulate with the Edwards' and Mr Clapp\". They cast around for one argument after another: if the couple had children, these might suffer an \"awful consequence\", especially if they were girls (by having their feet bound, or worse); Anna herself would be mistreated by her husband's family; the union might not be recognised by the Norwegian consular authorities; if they were to be married, why not do it outside Taiyuan - in a country inn, for example?</p> <p>Anna and Cheng's supporters stood firm. Edwards told the objectors that it would be \"a sin against God\" to try to stop the marriage. Clapp said that he saw no scriptural reason for declining to wed them. Seven missionaries and their families attended the service - their names were promptly reported to CIM headquarters. One of those who attended wrote an abject letter explaining that he had gone merely \"so as not to ostracise Miss Jakobsen\".</p> <p>At the wedding feast, Cheng let his new wife sit at the top table while he \"remained outside in the yard in conversation with the natives\". He could not eat his fill, he explained, in the presence of foreigners. This effort to avoid upsetting the foreign guests by his presence was turned against him in the mission's report home. The event was supposed to be a Christian marriage, Anna's critics argued, in which \"the woman takes the place of submission to her husband\", but Cheng's self-effacing behaviour showed that \"here [the relationship] was reversed\".</p> <p>The five years between Anna's first declaration and her marriage leave no doubt that she and Cheng were seriously in love. Yet she can also be seen as a forerunner of 20th-century missionary thinking in her commitment to working through the Chinese - a move that roused real fears she might pave the way for an indigenous church. \"There was a great danger\", wrote Hudson Taylor, \"of her heading a party of [Chinese] and together breaking away from the Mission.\" Anna was certainly a more complex character than most of her colleagues in the CIM. We only know the bare outline of her subsequent life.</p> <p>Anna and Cheng carried out her original plan to preach the gospel in the \"hostile province\" of Hunan, settling in the town of Xiangtan. They were safer there - but only just. In July 1900, Anna wrote to her former employer in Kristiansand describing a dramatic flight to safety with her one-year-old daughter. At one point, she wrote, \"a hundred men were coming, not far from our house, to kill us\".</p> <p>Anna continued to work in the southern provinces, supported by funds from mission societies in Norway. She died in 1911 and was survived by her daughter, Mary. Mary was taken to Scotland by the old family friend, Dr Edwards, and educated there. She later married a missionary doctor surnamed Wright and served with him in the Sudan. Mary Wright, the offspring of a remarkable marriage, ended her years in Swindon.</p> <p>The tale of the missionary ordeal in 1900 has received little attention in more recent times - perhaps because it raises some awkward questions for both sides. At the time, it was recorded in a number of what would now be called instant books, mostly by survivors and written from the missionaries' point of view. The most popular (14 editions in 20 years) was A Thousand Miles Of Miracle In China, by the CIM's Archibald Glover; he describes a long trek south to safety with his family and colleagues, during which they endured frequent episodes of robbery, imprisonment and mob violence.</p> <p>His pregnant wife survived the journey, only to die within weeks together with her newly born child. Dr Edwards - the champion two years earlier of Anna's marriage - was away \"on furlough\" at the time of the massacre. He returned with the official allied mission, acting as interpreter for a while to the German forces, and gathered material for Fire And Sword In Shansi: The Story Of The Martyrdom Of Foreigners And Chinese Christians.</p> <p>When western interest in China's modern history revived in the 1960s and 70s, a more critical view prevailed. The missionaries were seen as tarnished by association with the imperialism of the late 19th century. It seemed covertly racist to dwell on the treatment handed out by Chinese peasants to these western interlopers. At best, the missionaries had strayed into dangerous territory; at worst, they were part of the forces of oppression.</p> <p>Chinese scholarship has had different problems with how to handle the Boxers over the years. Though anti-foreign, they were pro-imperial dynasty, except at the outset, and had no explicit revolutionary aims. And while their courageous but futile battles against western troops could be hailed, it was difficult to dwell on their acts of violence against peaceful missionary families. The solution, even in recent mainland histories, is to skate very quickly over the missionary killings, which are referred to as jiaoan, or \"religious cases\". Wherever possible, the missionaries are portrayed as presenting a threat or provoking the masses' rage.</p> <p>The Taiyuan-based missionary, Edith Coombs - one of the seven who attended Anna's wedding - died on June 27, 1900, outside the Shouyang Mission. Witnesses, Chinese Christians, said that she had been separated from the main party of those fleeing the mission compound (who themselves were slaughtered days later by Governor Yu Hsien) while she was attempting to protect two Chinese girl converts. By their account, the mission was set on fire by Boxers and their sympathisers, and Edith Coombs was beaten badly and thrown to her death in the flames.</p> <p>A very different version is given in History Of The Boxers' Resistance To The Great Powers' Division Of China, by Lau Anshi, published in 1997. Ms Coombs is accused of provoking the \"religious case\" by brandishing a pistol and claiming that her bag had been snatched. No mention is made of the compound being burnt down. The same book argues that the missionaries killed in the governor's courtyard were plotting against the government.</p> <p>How did the missionaries themselves view their ordeal? While admitting their fears and foreboding, they viewed everything that happened to them, down to the last detail, as God's will. On the Glovers' long journey south, the occasional acts of charity with which they met were attributed to \"the merciful kindness of Him Who had never left us\". If God refused to ease their plight by ending the drought, he must have a reason for it. As Dr Clapp argued before his own death, all that happened was \"for the glory of God in the end, though, we can't see how now\". For the missionaries, as well as for the Boxers, historian Paul Cohen has written, everything was \"in the control of Heaven\".</p> <p>In many ways, the missionary experience reflected the wider contradictions of the west in China. Here was a group of foreigners prepared to suffer great hardship to bring spiritual light and medical help to the \"heathen Chinese\". Every diary that survives tells stories of odysseys by mule cart, endless nights in flea-bitten inns, abuse and stoning by angry crowds, all endured with prayers and, whenever possible, \"a cup of cocoa\". The missionaries took in orphans, sheltered battered wives and helped opium smokers to shake off their addiction.</p> <p>Although the Bible was accused of following the gunboats (and the opium trade), most missionaries kept their distance from the treaty powers. The survivors of the earlier Gutian massacre in Fujian (August 1895) urged forgiveness when they reached Hong Kong. Some foreign protestors accused the missionaries of being too ready to turn the other cheek - although others were irritated by their foolhardy ventures, which jeopardised foreign business.</p> <p>The missionaries were derided for harvesting an absurdly small number of souls - many described as \"rice Christians\", who consented to conversion in return for material handouts. Yet hundreds of these \"native converts\" refused to recant to save their lives when offered the chance by the Boxers.</p> <p>There was bigotry on both sides. The Chinese scholar class resented the challenge to their doctrinal authority as custodians of Confucian tradition, and published lurid pamphlets attacking the missionaries. And the missions regarded the Chinese masses as children led astray by the devil. \"The officials are demented,\" wrote Hudson Taylor's colleague Griffith John, \"and the people are sheep without a shepherd.\" Taylor himself talked of converting the Chinese as if he were conducting a military campaign. \"Satan [Chinese opposition to Christianity] is simply raging,\" he wrote, \"and the conflict is awful.\"</p> <p>All the Protestant missions were hostile to the Roman Catholics - whose own losses in the Boxer Rebellion were not included in the lists of victims published by the CIM. And some missionaries became obsessed, cut off at their stations. Dr W L Pruen was convinced that the Chinese people were descended from Japheth, the third son of Noah who was \"buried 100 miles dues south of Shanghai\".</p> <p>In a sense, the missionaries' commitment was flawed because ultimately they had the backing of foreign military power. Sometimes, they took advantage of the \"unequal treaties\" imposed by the west. For their part, western powers exploited \"outrages\" against missionaries to grab territorial concessions, thus fuelling the Boxers' anti-foreign appeal.</p> <p>The entire course of modern China was changed by the murder of the two German missionaries in Shandong in 1897, which gave the Kaiser his chance to brandish an \"iron fist\". He seized control of the province, thus providing fertile ground for the Boxers, who began their doomed uprising within the next year. The humiliating terms imposed on China by the Boxer Protocol in 1901 gave a new boost to Chinese nationalism, paving the way for the collapse of Manchu imperial rule 10 years later.</p> <p>Missionary activity became more enlightened in the early decades of the 20th century, and advocates of a \"social gospel\", stressing education and health, prevailed. Chinese Christians (no longer labelled as native) lobbied for independence, laying the foundation for an indigenous church, which survived the Communist Revolution.</p> <p>Chinese law now prohibits foreign missionary activities, but some overseas groups defy the law by sending preachers masquerading as tourists. Others send young missionaries in the role of English-language teachers, taking advantage of local authorities that are willing to employ them at cheap rates without too many questions asked. It is not unusual to meet young westerners - usually from the US - in some remote area. If you ask why they are there, they may say they are interested in \"ethnic questions\" and, if prodded, admit a \"personal connection\" to a (usually fundamentalist) Christian sect.</p> <p>CIM missionaries worked in China right up until after the 1949 Communist revolution. Since then, under the name of Overseas Missionary Fellowship (OMF) - and, until 1991, under the leadership of Hudson Taylor's great-grandson, Dr James Hudson Taylor III - it has expanded its work in other parts of Asia: the original CIM monthly publication, China's Millions, was relaunched as Asia's Billions.</p> <p>The Chinese church (Catholic as well as Protestant) has now revived, with tens of millions of adherents both in the officially recognised churches and in illegal \"house churches\" in the rural areas. Congregations of 5,000-6,000 are common, with the faithful sitting shoulder to shoulder on the ground outside churches too small to accommodate all the faithful. Sarah Young and Anna Jakobsen would hail it as a miracle</p>",

      "bodyText": "A hundred years ago, Sarah Alice Young, an American missionary, was killed in the Shanxi province of China. She was stabbed to death on the banks of the Yellow River in the arms of her \"kindest and best of husbands\", John Young, a fellow American. They had been married just over a year. Sarah and John were among 180 missionaries and their families slaughtered in the summer of 1900 at the height of the peasant uprising known as the Boxer Rebellion. The Boxers had emerged from the drought-stricken countryside of northern China and, in June, laid siege to the foreign legations in Beijing. Soon after, the missionaries, vulnerable in their lonely \"stations\" across rural northern China, were hunted down and killed - nearly half of them in Shanxi province. One of the few to have escaped the blood-letting there was Anna Jakobsen, a Norwegian in her mid-30s, of an independent turn of mind. Like Sarah Young, she belonged to one of the largest bands of Protestant missionaries, the China Inland Mission (CIM), which had proselytised boldly, but often foolishly, in remote areas of China since the 1860s. She, too, was recently married but, unlike Sarah, Anna had, in the eyes of the mission, chosen the wrong sort of husband - she had married a Chinese man, Cheng Hsiao-yu, a convert to Christianity and a lay preacher. Her outraged colleagues had banished the couple to leave the province two years before the massacres - and so unwittingly saved their lives. Missionaries were seen by many Chinese as agents of the foreign powers that had been seeking to \"open up\" the country since Britain launched the first Opium War in 1839. Their strange religious practices were blamed for flood, drought and unexplained deaths. They were the most visible targets in the anti-foreign storm of 1900, led by the Boxer rebels. We still have a poor understanding of what drove hundreds of young people such as Sarah and Anna to their largely quixotic enterprise in China. The educational qualifications of the CIM evangelists varied widely, and they preached a fundamentalist view of the scriptures to bewildered, often hostile audiences. The mission's own statistics show that, after 35 years of hard work in nearly 400 \"stations\", they had baptised fewer than 13,000 converts. Committed to work in the interior of China, \"where Christ has not been named\", the CIM missionaries wore Chinese clothes and built churches in Chinese-style architecture. But they preached an uncompromising doctrine that regarded Chinese culture and tradition as the work of the devil. Across this deep cultural and racial chasm, Anna's marriage with Cheng Hsiao-yu was regarded by her fellow missionaries - with a few notable exceptions - as a catastrophe. \"I do not know of any blow [the] Missions in China have had the last 30 years that is nearly so serious,\" wrote Hudson Taylor, the CIM's patriarchal founder, No one foresaw the real blow that would soon hit the movement. The Boxers were, at the time, the latest in China's history of peasant movements, which had erupted periodically in hard times to challenge a crumbling dynasty. Their leaders won converts by practising martial arts in the market place, claiming to be possessed by local deities that gave them the power of curing the sick. The movement had many attractions for thousands of young peasants with little food and no work. Their adherents wore colourful uniforms with red or yellow turbans, sashes and leggings. Their ritual exercises were supposed to make them impervious to foreign bullets. They began direct attacks upon foreigners and on foreign-built railway and telegraph lines in late 1899. The Imperial Court was at first divided over whether to support or suppress the Boxers, but the balance tipped after the foreign powers reinforced their embassy guards in Beijing. The Manchu, or Qing, dynasty, dominated by the formidable Empress Dowager Tzu Hsi, enlisted the Boxers in a last-ditch effort to shake off the tightening grip of the western powers. Tzu Hsi had recently deposed her nephew, the young emperor Kwang-hsu, after he had defied her by launching an unsuccessful round of reforms. On June 21, 1900, the court issued a declaration of war, and the Boxers were enlisted in the government militia. This was the start of the Siege of Peking. In the European quarter of the city, the resident diplomats, foreign traders and bankers were able to hold out behind makeshift barricades for two months. An eight-nation allied relief force, including a British contingent, made its way from the coast, with much bickering between the rival commanders. When it lifted the siege on August 14, it proceeded to loot, kill and rape with as much ferocity as the Boxers had shown (with the difference that the Boxers looted and killed, but did not rape). The reforming drive of the young emperor had not been helped by the greed of the foreign powers. One country after another claimed a \"sphere of influence\" with exclusive economic rights. Germany seized Shandong province in 1898 after two of its missionaries were killed there. France gained concessions in the south; Japan in the north-east. Britain claimed the Yangtze Valley and took a 99-year-lease on the \"New Territories\", which now form part of Hong Kong. Foreign consumer goods - cotton yarns, matches, paraffin - poured in to the countryside, driving local cottage industries out of business. In their own way, the foreign missionaries provoked hostility, too. Their right to travel freely all over China had been won by the force of western arms in the Second Opium War of 1858-61, and local Chinese officials were supposed to give them protection - a concession some Chinese Christian converts tried to exploit for their own ends. One of the most common causes of misunderstanding was the missionaries' eagerness to rescue orphans and to baptise young children even when they were sick or dying. As early as 1870, an anti-foreign riot in Tianjin had been sparked by rumours that a Catholic mission was bewitching children, mutilating their bodies and extracting their hearts and eyes to make medicine. But in rural communities desperately dependent upon water for their economic survival, the most common grievance against the missionaries was that they prevented the rains from falling - and in 1900 the rains failed throughout northern China. \"There were special causes for a popular rising during the spring,\" wrote the American missionary author Arthur Smith. \"The drought was great, and practically universal. For the first time since the great famine of 1878, no winter wheat to speak of had been planted in any part of northern China.\" As the water famine spread, so did rumours that local Christians were poisoning the wells. Out in the field, the missionaries understood the danger only too well. \"Dry as powder - oppressive duststorm - God give us rain,\" one wrote in a letter home from Baoding, near Beijing, just a month before his community was wiped out by Boxers. \"That would quiet things for a moment. We can't be sure of a single day's life. Pray for us. Pray for rain.\" The arrival of the Germans in Shandong coincided with a disastrous flood, in which the Yellow River had burst its dikes, followed by two years of drought. It was no coincidence that the Boxer movement first emerged in this province and successfully mobilised popular anger against local Christians. Far from Beijing, in the parched countryside, the missionaries sought protection - usually in vain - from timid or hostile local officials, or hid in huts and caves. A few small groups managed to trek south, robbed and harassed by local peasants, until they reached the Yangtze River and travelled down it to safety in Shanghai. Shanxi's governor, Yu Hsien, had been sympathetic to the Boxers from the start. In Shanxi's provincial capital, Taiyuan, he supervised the execution of two groups of missionary families and a number of Chinese converts in the courtyard of the governor's palace, personally giving the order \"Sha!\" (Kill!). At their isolated station in Jizhou (now called Jixian), close to the great Hukou waterfalls on the Yellow River, Sarah and John Young were unaware of the events in Taiyuan. In a letter on July 7, 1900 - just nine days before their deaths - Sarah, who was then 29, wrote, \"We are so quiet here that we can scarcely realise the trouble you are having down there on the plain. We feel quite safe here, at least for the present.\" Very soon after, Boxer militants must have reached their rural outpost. The Youngs fled with a small group led by George McConnell from the next mission station. They headed for the Yellow River, hoping to cross to the relative safety of Shaanxi (a different province from Shanxi). As they neared the river, not far from the great bend where it turns east, they were overtaken by a band of soldiers claiming that they had been sent to escort them to a safer crossing place. Once there, however, the soldiers announced that they had actually come to murder them. The McConnells' son, Kenneth, seven, spoke out in childish Chinese: \"Papa bu zhun ni sha xiao Kennie\" (My daddy won't let you kill little Kennie). The soldiers, who had been paid by local gentry to do their job, were unmoved. Kenneth and his parents were dragged off their mules and despatched with a sword. Sarah and John embraced as they were killed. Their bodies were never discovered and may have been tossed into the Yellow River. Some of Sarah's letters home survive from her time in Jizhou. The town was \"an out of the way place back in the mountains where no cart has ever been\", she wrote. It had been \"devastated by rebellion and robbers\". There were only a few faithful Christians, and even their commitment was shaky. \"On Sunday we found out,\" wrote Sarah sadly, \"that one of the members whom John trusted and thought to be honest has for months been taking opium and is also gambling and trying to get his little-daughter-in-law's feet bound up. Some time ago, too, we found that another one [church member] is working in his fields on Sunday.\" Enforcing the Sabbath was clearly a problem in Jizhou. \"All these things weigh heavy on John, and make him look quite worn at times.\" Yet the couple were extremely happy in their lonely companionship. Sarah thanked God for \"a kind, loving husband\", and wondered \"why the Lord has been so good to me\". They travelled over the hills on rough roads to preach in villages composed of hillside caves. John played on a \"Melodeon\" and soon, not surprisingly, attracted large crowds. Some of them listened as he preached, but others \"paid no heed\". On returning home, Sarah would have to wash John's hair - the Chinese pigtail that he wore, she explained, \"catches all the dust and dirt\". Sarah referred to herself, with joking affection, as his housekeeper. John appreciated other things, too. Sarah started a letter to another sister and broke it off midway, resuming the next day with the ingenuous remark that, \"I was stopped writing on Monday by John coming in for a chat and guess the rest!\" Sarah was a cheerful Midwesterner, who, from her correspondence, combined religious fervour with a healthy interest in everyday life. One of 10 children, she was raised in the Amish Mennonite church. After attending a Bible institute in Kansas, she enrolled with the North American branch of the CIM, Toronto, in 1895. There, she was equipped with a Ladies Outfit List, specifying everything from flannel night-dresses, pillowcases (both white and coloured), three suits of winter underwear, tea towels and a \"hot water bag\", to needles and thread, a chamber pot, insect powder and the Good Bible Concordance. Amid all the preparations, she and her new colleagues were anxious, she wrote, \"to be off to our poor perishing Chinese, 30,000 per day die without the gospel, and we all here at home yet. It is terrible to think about it.\" By February 1896, she was on a riverboat on the Yangtze, putting on Chinese clothes and taking her first meal with chopsticks. After two months' language training, she was on her way on a month-long journey, by mule cart and litter, to Shanxi province. For a young American abroad for the first time, it was an exciting journey. Her pride in her Chinese dress (she was told that \"it adds wonderfully to my dignity\") and her pleasure at riding a donkey is evident. But, she hastened to add, \"I am very happy in China not because of my surroundings but because I am working for Him who left much for me [to] do.\" Sarah did not take long to feel the hostility of many in Shanxi, who saw the foreign missionaries as bringers of ill fate. During a dry spell in August, \"the people carried their rain god along the streets for a few days and nights making a great noise with gongs and drums. Several times in the night they stopped to pound on our street door calling out against the foreigners for keeping the rain away.\" She observed the life around her carefully, and wrote a detailed description of threshing techniques, methods of making rope and paper, and a street sawmill. Sarah never knew what reception she would receive on her \"itinerations\". Local inn-keepers might refuse her a room, in which case she would \"ask the Lord to lead us to a resting place\". Or there might be bugs in the bedding and opium smokers next door. \"We can tell them at once,\" she noted, \"by their deathly faces and black teeth\". Within a few months, Sarah was musing on marriage - but only to reject it resolutely. \"No, I am not 'looking for someone still',\" she wrote home in December 1896. \"I believe I am chosen to work without a helpmate. It seems to me a woman's work in China is so much hindered by marriage!\" Nevertheless, quite soon she met John Young at the mission centre in Lu-an where she was based, and by mid-1898 they had an understanding. He returned to his lonely out-station at Jizhou, and quickly passed the successive grades in the Chinese language demanded by the CIM. In February 1899, he came back \"to take me away\". Sarah was going to be married in a Chinese dress of blue satin, its sleeves faced with pale pink silk. The mission rallied round with wedding presents, including an eiderdown quilt, a hanging lamp, eight towels, a tea cosy and two large framed texts. No one had any doubt that it was a marriage made in heaven. The send-off given to Anna Jakobsen when she married Cheng Hsiao-yu in the teeth of the CIM's opposition was very different. Who was this resolute young Norwegian who entered in to what may have been the first marriage in China between a western woman and a Chinese man? Anna had worked in Kristiansand, a town at the southern tip of Norway, for the family of a businessman called Rasmussen, who supported the CIM with donations. Two of his daughters later became missionaries, one of them surviving a long trek to Hankou on the Yangtze River to escape the Boxers in 1900. Anna the housemaid - then in her early 20s - volunteered early on, and together with the family governess, Sophie Reuter, joined the CIM in 1884. They became \"pioneers in skirts\", Norway's first missionaries abroad. Anna and Sophie were sent to the remote station of Hezhou in southern Shanxi - across the hills from Jizhou, where the Youngs would be working 10 years later. They were praised for their \"lives of singular Christ-likeness and devotion\". Sophie soon married Stanley Smith, a muscular Christian from Cambridge (he had captained the university boat) who was close to Hudson Taylor. Anna must surely have received at least one proposal from fellow missionaries. Marriage was regarded as a stabilising influence within the mission and a solution to the loneliness of the single male. When Sophie died of typhoid in 1891, Stanley Smith remarried within two years. But Anna laboured on alone for seven years, until 1893, when she announced that she was engaged to a fellow evangelist: Cheng Hsiao-yu. Anna did not mention the word love, but chose a more subtle argument. She was determined to work in Hunan, where no foreign mission had yet penetrated. Anna believed, she said, that marriage to a Chinese would make her more acceptable in this \"hostile province\". On this first occasion, the male hierarchy of the CIM prevailed on Anna to think again. In the words of its standard history, she \"had not considered the repercussions upon other single girls in the Mission\". Until now, no Chinese male had looked on western women missionaries as eligible for marriage. The precedent they were setting \"would expose all the single girls to unwelcome attention by unsuitable men, if not to danger\". (In fact, far from making unmarried women missionaries more vulnerable in China, Anna's marriage to a Chinese man may even have helped to diminish popular prejudice. If the women travelled in the company of their male colleagues, they were assumed to be concubines. If they travelled on their own, they would be accused of being prostitutes.) Five years later, in the summer of 1898, Anna declared her intention of marrying Cheng again, and this time she would not be budged. Agitated correspondence from Shanxi to CIM headquarters in Stoke Newington, north London, reveals the reaction of most of Anna's colleagues. \"The almost universal feeling of consternation the news produced,\" wrote missionary A Hoddle to Hudson Taylor, \"was succeeded by a perfect storm of protest.\" A few colleagues rallied to Anna and Cheng's defence. Dr EH Edwards, an experienced medical missionary, and his wife had supported the couple from the start. A sympathetic American Baptist, DH Clapp, agreed to marry them in the house of a Chinese Christian photographer in Taiyuan. On the morning of the wedding, two opponents of the marriage from Anna's mission headquarters outside the city leapt on horseback and rode in at top speed \"to expostulate with the Edwards' and Mr Clapp\". They cast around for one argument after another: if the couple had children, these might suffer an \"awful consequence\", especially if they were girls (by having their feet bound, or worse); Anna herself would be mistreated by her husband's family; the union might not be recognised by the Norwegian consular authorities; if they were to be married, why not do it outside Taiyuan - in a country inn, for example? Anna and Cheng's supporters stood firm. Edwards told the objectors that it would be \"a sin against God\" to try to stop the marriage. Clapp said that he saw no scriptural reason for declining to wed them. Seven missionaries and their families attended the service - their names were promptly reported to CIM headquarters. One of those who attended wrote an abject letter explaining that he had gone merely \"so as not to ostracise Miss Jakobsen\". At the wedding feast, Cheng let his new wife sit at the top table while he \"remained outside in the yard in conversation with the natives\". He could not eat his fill, he explained, in the presence of foreigners. This effort to avoid upsetting the foreign guests by his presence was turned against him in the mission's report home. The event was supposed to be a Christian marriage, Anna's critics argued, in which \"the woman takes the place of submission to her husband\", but Cheng's self-effacing behaviour showed that \"here [the relationship] was reversed\". The five years between Anna's first declaration and her marriage leave no doubt that she and Cheng were seriously in love. Yet she can also be seen as a forerunner of 20th-century missionary thinking in her commitment to working through the Chinese - a move that roused real fears she might pave the way for an indigenous church. \"There was a great danger\", wrote Hudson Taylor, \"of her heading a party of [Chinese] and together breaking away from the Mission.\" Anna was certainly a more complex character than most of her colleagues in the CIM. We only know the bare outline of her subsequent life. Anna and Cheng carried out her original plan to preach the gospel in the \"hostile province\" of Hunan, settling in the town of Xiangtan. They were safer there - but only just. In July 1900, Anna wrote to her former employer in Kristiansand describing a dramatic flight to safety with her one-year-old daughter. At one point, she wrote, \"a hundred men were coming, not far from our house, to kill us\". Anna continued to work in the southern provinces, supported by funds from mission societies in Norway. She died in 1911 and was survived by her daughter, Mary. Mary was taken to Scotland by the old family friend, Dr Edwards, and educated there. She later married a missionary doctor surnamed Wright and served with him in the Sudan. Mary Wright, the offspring of a remarkable marriage, ended her years in Swindon. The tale of the missionary ordeal in 1900 has received little attention in more recent times - perhaps because it raises some awkward questions for both sides. At the time, it was recorded in a number of what would now be called instant books, mostly by survivors and written from the missionaries' point of view. The most popular (14 editions in 20 years) was A Thousand Miles Of Miracle In China, by the CIM's Archibald Glover; he describes a long trek south to safety with his family and colleagues, during which they endured frequent episodes of robbery, imprisonment and mob violence. His pregnant wife survived the journey, only to die within weeks together with her newly born child. Dr Edwards - the champion two years earlier of Anna's marriage - was away \"on furlough\" at the time of the massacre. He returned with the official allied mission, acting as interpreter for a while to the German forces, and gathered material for Fire And Sword In Shansi: The Story Of The Martyrdom Of Foreigners And Chinese Christians. When western interest in China's modern history revived in the 1960s and 70s, a more critical view prevailed. The missionaries were seen as tarnished by association with the imperialism of the late 19th century. It seemed covertly racist to dwell on the treatment handed out by Chinese peasants to these western interlopers. At best, the missionaries had strayed into dangerous territory; at worst, they were part of the forces of oppression. Chinese scholarship has had different problems with how to handle the Boxers over the years. Though anti-foreign, they were pro-imperial dynasty, except at the outset, and had no explicit revolutionary aims. And while their courageous but futile battles against western troops could be hailed, it was difficult to dwell on their acts of violence against peaceful missionary families. The solution, even in recent mainland histories, is to skate very quickly over the missionary killings, which are referred to as jiaoan, or \"religious cases\". Wherever possible, the missionaries are portrayed as presenting a threat or provoking the masses' rage. The Taiyuan-based missionary, Edith Coombs - one of the seven who attended Anna's wedding - died on June 27, 1900, outside the Shouyang Mission. Witnesses, Chinese Christians, said that she had been separated from the main party of those fleeing the mission compound (who themselves were slaughtered days later by Governor Yu Hsien) while she was attempting to protect two Chinese girl converts. By their account, the mission was set on fire by Boxers and their sympathisers, and Edith Coombs was beaten badly and thrown to her death in the flames. A very different version is given in History Of The Boxers' Resistance To The Great Powers' Division Of China, by Lau Anshi, published in 1997. Ms Coombs is accused of provoking the \"religious case\" by brandishing a pistol and claiming that her bag had been snatched. No mention is made of the compound being burnt down. The same book argues that the missionaries killed in the governor's courtyard were plotting against the government. How did the missionaries themselves view their ordeal? While admitting their fears and foreboding, they viewed everything that happened to them, down to the last detail, as God's will. On the Glovers' long journey south, the occasional acts of charity with which they met were attributed to \"the merciful kindness of Him Who had never left us\". If God refused to ease their plight by ending the drought, he must have a reason for it. As Dr Clapp argued before his own death, all that happened was \"for the glory of God in the end, though, we can't see how now\". For the missionaries, as well as for the Boxers, historian Paul Cohen has written, everything was \"in the control of Heaven\". In many ways, the missionary experience reflected the wider contradictions of the west in China. Here was a group of foreigners prepared to suffer great hardship to bring spiritual light and medical help to the \"heathen Chinese\". Every diary that survives tells stories of odysseys by mule cart, endless nights in flea-bitten inns, abuse and stoning by angry crowds, all endured with prayers and, whenever possible, \"a cup of cocoa\". The missionaries took in orphans, sheltered battered wives and helped opium smokers to shake off their addiction. Although the Bible was accused of following the gunboats (and the opium trade), most missionaries kept their distance from the treaty powers. The survivors of the earlier Gutian massacre in Fujian (August 1895) urged forgiveness when they reached Hong Kong. Some foreign protestors accused the missionaries of being too ready to turn the other cheek - although others were irritated by their foolhardy ventures, which jeopardised foreign business. The missionaries were derided for harvesting an absurdly small number of souls - many described as \"rice Christians\", who consented to conversion in return for material handouts. Yet hundreds of these \"native converts\" refused to recant to save their lives when offered the chance by the Boxers. There was bigotry on both sides. The Chinese scholar class resented the challenge to their doctrinal authority as custodians of Confucian tradition, and published lurid pamphlets attacking the missionaries. And the missions regarded the Chinese masses as children led astray by the devil. \"The officials are demented,\" wrote Hudson Taylor's colleague Griffith John, \"and the people are sheep without a shepherd.\" Taylor himself talked of converting the Chinese as if he were conducting a military campaign. \"Satan [Chinese opposition to Christianity] is simply raging,\" he wrote, \"and the conflict is awful.\" All the Protestant missions were hostile to the Roman Catholics - whose own losses in the Boxer Rebellion were not included in the lists of victims published by the CIM. And some missionaries became obsessed, cut off at their stations. Dr W L Pruen was convinced that the Chinese people were descended from Japheth, the third son of Noah who was \"buried 100 miles dues south of Shanghai\". In a sense, the missionaries' commitment was flawed because ultimately they had the backing of foreign military power. Sometimes, they took advantage of the \"unequal treaties\" imposed by the west. For their part, western powers exploited \"outrages\" against missionaries to grab territorial concessions, thus fuelling the Boxers' anti-foreign appeal. The entire course of modern China was changed by the murder of the two German missionaries in Shandong in 1897, which gave the Kaiser his chance to brandish an \"iron fist\". He seized control of the province, thus providing fertile ground for the Boxers, who began their doomed uprising within the next year. The humiliating terms imposed on China by the Boxer Protocol in 1901 gave a new boost to Chinese nationalism, paving the way for the collapse of Manchu imperial rule 10 years later. Missionary activity became more enlightened in the early decades of the 20th century, and advocates of a \"social gospel\", stressing education and health, prevailed. Chinese Christians (no longer labelled as native) lobbied for independence, laying the foundation for an indigenous church, which survived the Communist Revolution. Chinese law now prohibits foreign missionary activities, but some overseas groups defy the law by sending preachers masquerading as tourists. Others send young missionaries in the role of English-language teachers, taking advantage of local authorities that are willing to employ them at cheap rates without too many questions asked. It is not unusual to meet young westerners - usually from the US - in some remote area. If you ask why they are there, they may say they are interested in \"ethnic questions\" and, if prodded, admit a \"personal connection\" to a (usually fundamentalist) Christian sect. CIM missionaries worked in China right up until after the 1949 Communist revolution. Since then, under the name of Overseas Missionary Fellowship (OMF) - and, until 1991, under the leadership of Hudson Taylor's great-grandson, Dr James Hudson Taylor III - it has expanded its work in other parts of Asia: the original CIM monthly publication, China's Millions, was relaunched as Asia's Billions. The Chinese church (Catholic as well as Protestant) has now revived, with tens of millions of adherents both in the officially recognised churches and in illegal \"house churches\" in the rural areas. Congregations of 5,000-6,000 are common, with the faithful sitting shoulder to shoulder on the ground outside churches too small to accommodate all the faithful. Sarah Young and Anna Jakobsen would hail it as a miracle",

      "byline": "Hank van Woerden",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A few minutes after 3pm on September 6 1966, Demitrios Tsafendas, a messenger in South Africa's parliament, walked up to the country's prime minister, Hendrik Vervoerd, in the chamber of the House in full public view and stabbed him four times. Tsafendas was overpowered, disarmed and dragged away. Verwoerd died within the hour. He was one of the architects of apartheid and Tsafendas one of its victims. Born in Mozambique, his father was Greek, his mother a black African. His father disowned his mother and married a Greek woman and they moved to South Africa, where Demitrios was accepted as white. But he soon discovered that he did not fit in anywhere. He became exiled from family, community, heritage, country - and sanity, which undoubtedly saved him from execution after the Verwoerd assassination. Many times and in many countries he was treated for psychiatric disorders. He believed he was possessed by a huge tape-worm that caused the mental torment he suffered throughout his life. After the murder Tsafendas was kept in prison for three decades, at times treated brutally. He was then sent to a psychiatric hospital in Krugersdorp, where he died last year. Henk van Woerden , a Dutch artist brought up in South Africa during the Verwoerd years, has written an account of Tsafendas's life. At the end, he went to visit the old man, expecting to find \"an extinguished human being - infantile, deaf, manifestly crazy\". </p> <p> <strong>This is what he discovered.</strong> </p> <p>What a fine head of snow-white hair! Demitrios's head was tilted to one side. He glanced at me, as if from an angle; his eye was placatory; his air perplexed. It was midday. Perhaps he had just eaten, and was ready for a nap. </p> <p>I shouted at him, in English: \"Pleased to meet you.\" </p> <p>He was wearing a light-blue T-shirt with L-O-N-D-O-N printed across it. He was dressed below in a pair of jogging trousers, bright green in colour, with white stripes running down the sides of the legs. His stomach showed through the gap between his shirt and trousers. His feet were thrust into narrow, ill-fitting, down-at-heel slippers. </p> <p>His pronunciation of English struck me as odd; I had not imagined that it would sound like this. The intonation was old-fashioned; he had an archaically middle-class accent that took me back to my childhood. I might almost have been listening - had I closed my eyes - to one of the adults I used to hear in those days. Or to a good-natured fatty from one of the British children's books I used to read. </p> <p>Matron Geyer put her head around the corner. Was everything all right? Yes, fine. Demitrios and I sat and smiled at one another, the old man still holding forth, I responding with nods. </p> <p>\"We Greeks were rivals against the Orientals. Very strong rivals. They brought me up very strict against the Orientals, the Arabs especially . . . I was taken out of the French mission school. I was learning the black language there, Shangaan. It was a big mistake. They should have left me but they sent me to a Catholic Portuguese school. And from there they took me out again and sent me to school in Middelburg, in the Transvaal. I had difficulty because of Afrikaans in one class and English in the other. I didn't know Afrikaans. But I kept on, I persisted, I had no choice because my parents were so strict.\" </p> <p>He told the story with evident satisfaction. If he had been some what subdued initially, he was now animated, alert, carried away by his own words. He spoke about his childhood days in Alexandria and the house of his grandmother Tsafandakis. He had long had in his possession a photograph of himself as a little boy, in Arab garb. </p> <p>\"I kept it. I put it in an envelope when I was in Pretoria Central prison. Potgieter, he destroyed it. It disappeared there. I used to keep it, but Potgieter the chief warder destroyed it, also my birth certificate. I had all that. I knew it was historic. But Potgieter was against me, he tore everything up. It would make history, but that stupid Potgieter...\" </p> <p>He trailed off, agitatedly, weeping. Over the following days he repeatedly complained about that incident. </p> <p>\"Potgieter was furious against anything that belonged to me. But his helper was very good to me. I'd like to see him. He sympathised with me and protected me whenever possible, when I was beaten on the skull. Blood used to come in! He was also an Afrikaner, but different.... Completely different, very good-natured,\" he repeated. A little later, clearly referring still to the prison in Pretoria, he said: \"I'd like to go back there, where I used to live in that building. It's been transformed into a holy place now. A hoooly place. You must find out. You must inquire.\" </p> <p>At one point he began to sing to me English songs from 50 and more years ago - for old times' sake, he said, the spittle flying out of the corner of his mouth as he said the phrase. By now he had become positively elated. Among the songs was A Bicycle Made for Two (\"Daisy, Daisy\"). Drawing long breaths, he also burst into a hymn I remembered from my schooldays: \"Onward Christian Soldiers/Marching as to war? With the cross of Jesus/Going on before...\" </p> <p>Weeks later the smell of that visit was still with me. It was the smell of old, unwashed men. The rotten sweetness of uncared-for teeth and unwashed armpits, mixed with the odours of half-digested food rising from the bow els and through the pores of the skin. Demitrios was a neglected creature. That was the truth. Matron Geyer was not to be blamed. There was nothing that she could do about it. The hospital was hopelessly understaffed. </p> <p>Just before I left, he asked: \"Are you an enthusiast of flying?\" </p> <p>The question was wonderfully dated. It belonged, I thought, to an era of golfing caps and plus fours on English greens. </p> <p>The meeting had left me feeling dizzy. I had come assuming that I would meet an extinguished human being. Someone whose illness could only have been exacerbated by three decades of imprisonment and maltreatment. A witness had described after the attack, almost without exception, in wholly unsympathetic terms: a pig, a liar, a nutcase. And, surely I would find him infantile, deaf, manifestly crazy. </p> <p>What I had found, instead, was a charming chatterbox. A survivor from the detritus of South African history. Why was he still confined in the wretched institution in which I had found him? Between 1942 and 1963 alone - his period abroad - he had been arrested five times, deported five times, twice incarcertated for long periods, and eight times refused entry into South Africa. During the 50s and 60s he had regarded himself as a kind of pilgrim, that much was clear. A man with a mission, even if he could never have said exactly where his Mecca lay. Now that everything was long behind him, he remained one of the few among the huge band of exiles who had never been able to come home again, either literally or metaphorically. </p> <p>Sitting next to an old man comprehensively saying his piece, I had felt myself to be endowed with an unwanted perspicacity. No doubt his stories sounded like concoctions to those who knew little or nothing of his background. For him, all he had ever been, all he could ever speak of, was secluded within a domain of glass, isolated, viewable only as if through a lens scored by sharp cracks and flaws. I asked myself if I knew of a better way of trying to apprehend the history of his country. </p> <p>After lunch his thoughts veered off on another tack. \"I wanted to have strong children. So I restrained myself from women. I kept myself chaste. No smoking, nothing. Working all the time. No whisky drinking. Milk shakes I drink, Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola. In Egypt we have a special drink from sugarcane, I don't remember what they call it. And pineapples. Water melon. Sweetmelon.\" </p> <p>He fell silent. </p> <p>I wrote on the pad: \"Was there a woman in your life?\" He read the question slowly, as if spelling it out letter by letter. It did not seem to dismay him. On the contrary, he set about answering it like a conscientious autobiographer, from the very beginning. </p> <p>\"The first woman in my life, I was young, I was underage. She was Portuguese and I used to go with her. She said to me: \"What do you like? Do you want to copulate or do you want me to suck you off?\" I said to her: \"I want to copulate. I want to push.\" I was very small...\" He laughed, relieved and amused at the memory. </p> <p>\"I had a girlfriend in Turkey. She was very intelligent. She got me the job in the college as a professor of English. She spoke to the authorities. And in Athens, one of the Greek girls in my church loved me. But she died. A great love. And in Pretoria I went to the social workers' meetings and there was a Dutch girl there, very beautiful. But the preacher of the Gospel, he kept her away from me, he wanted her for himself... In America, too, there was a beautiful girl, an American, and in Germany one of the workers I like... But I could not compete. </p> <p>\"My biological mother used to call me \"Mimis.\" She liked me, but I was in love with her sister, Annie. Can you remember Marlene Dietrich?\" </p> <p>I nodded. </p> <p>\"Aha!\" he laughed. He began to sing: \"Falling in love again, what am I to do? Falling in looove again. </p> <p>\"My father was very strict. He always watched you, in case . . .\" He made masturbatory gestures with his hand. \"He was an engineer. He sacrificed his life to a perpetual motion machine. And I continued in his footsteps. My brother was also a lathe-turner. But my biological mother, she spoiled my brother. In the morning she gives him eggs, fried eggs, scrambled eggs. He, not me. He was born with one leg first, out of my stepmother. Not with the head. She was screaming all night. It was a breech birth. That's why she is like that.\" </p> <p>His chin sank towards his chest and he stuck out his lower lip, as if sulking. Then he lifted his head, recalling something important. </p> <p>\"She made a big mistake in Louren\u00e7o Marques when a Portuguese chemist discovered that I had a tapeworm. He gave me some medicine, an extract, a powerful poison. He said: 'You must bring the species' head. I must study it.' I drink the extract and the following day it started coming out. I went to the toilet and half of it was out, two or three metres. But the chemist had said: 'You must not throw it away. You must bring it to me. I want to study it.' My stepmother said: 'It's out, out.' She put it in the toilet.\" He mimed the pulling of a toilet chain. </p> <p>\"A big mistake! A very big mistake! Two or three metres....I think it's still alive in the sewers, because it doesn't die, it's very strong. And the Portuguese chemist was very angry. He said: 'Why do you throw it away?' But the sewer is still there. I want to study the sewer underneath the old house. I want to go back to the sewer.\" </p> <p>He gazed at me with amber-coloured eyes. \"You must help me.\" And later, wistfully, after I had taken a photo of him, \"I want you to photograph me in front of my house, in front of my property. I want you to help me.</p> <p> It was difficult to imagine how deeply within himself a man like Demitrios would have felt the dilemma of the \"baster\" - the bastard, the half-blood. How it must have maimed his sense of self-worth, and the hopelessness he had known as a result. Non-whites were generally regarded by the whites as dirty, animal-like, untrustworthy; but the half-breed was the worst, precisely because he was so close to themselves. </p> <p>Throughout his life, Demitrios had claimed that somehwhere in southern Africa there was a woman waiting for him, the love of his youth. Even as a figment of his imagination, however, this ideal figure threatened to produce for him dark-skinned progeny, who would bring to light the concealed, hereditary stigma of his bad blood. He could cross the line, go over, \"play white\", though always carrying within him the self-estrangement of his dark conscience. </p> <p>Or, once his wanderings over Europe had miserably ended, he could take on the role of the shamed and vengeful Coloured. He would destroy the loud-voiced chief of the white tribe. With or without the help of the tapeworm inside him, he cut off the creature's head. </p> <p>His deed was the direct consequence of sublunary traumas. The tribal sentiments of the Afrikaner were derived in large measure from some of the sentiments that Tsafendas had harboured within himself: a longing to feel truly at home, a search for acknowledgement, a conviction that he had spent too long a time wandering the wilderness. The Afrikaner was ready to maintain his homeland through violence, the violence of the state if need be. His preoccupation with racial purity and unsoiled blood was central to that aim. Which of the two, then, was more truly crazy: Verwoerd or Tsafendas? </p> <p>It was hardly possible to exaggerate the importance of what Demitrios had done, I reflected. The attack on Verwoerd was a proclamation of the end of the doctrine of apartheid, of the idiotic dread of \"racial mixing\". It presaged the hesitant beginning of integration. Of a mixed-up living together - the very idea that had horrified so many generations of white South Africans. Of the birth of the \"rainbow nation\" which, in a bout of over-excitement and child-like honesty, Demitrios had called for in 1964. </p> <p>I had never been able to find any words for the feelings which had overwhelmed me on the afternoon of the attack in September 1966. Retrospectively, it now seemed that the power of madness had at that moment shown itself to be equal to the madness of power. The murder was a melancholy manifestation of being, as if nature itself were finally striking the balance between them. </p> <p>On Friday, March 27, I paid my last visit to Demitrios. I took with me a small Greek stringed instrument, a baglam\u00e1 , in the hope of diverting him. I showed him the baglam\u00e1 and strummed a little tune on it. </p> <p>\"Very interesting instrument,\" Demitrios said. \"Small in size. Delicate sound. I would have liked to have been able to play it myself. Or the piano accordion. The organ. Before that I was interested in the bugle. That was in Middelburg.\" </p> <p>Then, in a whisper, \"Play some more.\" </p> <p>The baglam\u00e1 has a piercing but attractive sound; I was glad that he was able to hear it. </p> <p>\"Do you play the violin, too? The saxophone? That's what I'd really like to do.\" </p> <p>The next question came out of the blue. He asked me who was the president of South Africa now. </p> <p>On my little pad I wrote the name \"Mandela\" and showed it to him. </p> <p>\"Nelson Mandela...? I would like to speak to him. He's a very strong man.\" </p> <p>When I made a few movements with my fists, like a boxer, Demitrios laughed out loud. From the hall behind us a harsh screaming suddenly broke out. If a stone could scream, it would make a noise like that. Then came the sounds of crashing crockery and another loud voice trying to restore order. </p> <p>Demitrios had fallen silent. If I were ever to ask the question, this had to be the moment. \"Do you remember Verwoerd?\" I scrawled on my pad with sudden awkward fingers, and handed it to him. </p> <p>\"I didn't know Hendrik Verwoerd personally.\" Demitrios sighed. He thought for a moment. \"I had never spoken to him before...\" </p> <p>The racket in the hall broke out briefly once more. Demitrios moved uneasily in his wheelchair. </p> <p>\"I do regret.....\" he stammered. \"I do regret.....,\" he said again and yet again, for the third time. \"I regret...\" He took the paper and pencil out of my hand. </p> <p>When he returned the pad to me I saw that he had written four words in untidy block letters. </p> <p>I REGRET WHAT HAPPENED. </p> <p>He began to cry. I took both his shoulders in my hands and shouted as loudly as I could: \"Never mind. Other times. Not your fault.\" </p> <p>\"A whole other time,\" he sobbed. \"I am not that kind of person. It was something that happened. It was not in my nature. Besides, I was sick.\" </p> <p>His striped dressing gown had fallen from his chest. Poor Mimis. In what followed, he placed the blame on the doctors. It was their fault. They should have operated on him. Why hadn't they done it? He pointed to his stomach. Why hadn't they removed the creature in there? Either they could not or they would not do it. </p> <p>\"It will not die. I'm helpless against this Dragon-Tapeworm. I cannot do anything. But they won't investigate. Too difficult and very complicated. At night when I sleep I see orgies. All imagination. Visions.\" </p> <p>Then he told me that, while he'd been working in parliament, he had heard from a woman member of the house that Verwoerd was not an upright human being. It was one of the things, he wanted me to know, that had set him thinking of what had to be done. \"She came to me - I found out later she was a member of the United Party - and she said: 'Hendrik Verwoerd is a very immoral person.' You see? When she told me that I went down . . . and that's how it started. She stirred me. She made me angry.\" </p> <p>Again, he began to weep; then made an effort to compose himself. \"I went down to the shopping centre on the Herengracht and I bought a knife. I went inside and I said: 'Give me a knife.' The woman gave me a little knife. I said: 'It's too small. Give me a bigger knife.' </p> <p>When he had fallen silent I wrote a few more words on the pad. </p> <p>\"Like a real Cretan,\" Demitrios read slowly. \"Yeah,\" he said calmly. \"Nature, hereditary nature. </p> <p>\"It's nature,\" he said again, with an air of finality. \"Human nature.\" </p> <p>When we said goodbye he pulled me closely to him, embracing me with one of his arms, and pressed, between sobs, a fatherly kiss on my cheek and forehead. </p> <p>Demitrios Tsafendas died on October 7 1999. According to a reliable source, he had insisted on making a will or testament of some sort several years previously. In it he is said to have stipulated that his body should undergo an autopsy, so that his \"worm\" might be exposed to the eyes of science at last. I have been unable to find out whether or not his wishes in this matter were heeded. </p> <p>\u0095 From the book A Mouthful of Glass by Henk van Woerden, translated by Dan Jacobson, published by Granta Books at \u00a312.99.

      "bodyText": "A few minutes after 3pm on September 6 1966, Demitrios Tsafendas, a messenger in South Africa's parliament, walked up to the country's prime minister, Hendrik Vervoerd, in the chamber of the House in full public view and stabbed him four times. Tsafendas was overpowered, disarmed and dragged away. Verwoerd died within the hour. He was one of the architects of apartheid and Tsafendas one of its victims. Born in Mozambique, his father was Greek, his mother a black African. His father disowned his mother and married a Greek woman and they moved to South Africa, where Demitrios was accepted as white. But he soon discovered that he did not fit in anywhere. He became exiled from family, community, heritage, country - and sanity, which undoubtedly saved him from execution after the Verwoerd assassination. Many times and in many countries he was treated for psychiatric disorders. He believed he was possessed by a huge tape-worm that caused the mental torment he suffered throughout his life. After the murder Tsafendas was kept in prison for three decades, at times treated brutally. He was then sent to a psychiatric hospital in Krugersdorp, where he died last year. Henk van Woerden , a Dutch artist brought up in South Africa during the Verwoerd years, has written an account of Tsafendas's life. At the end, he went to visit the old man, expecting to find \"an extinguished human being - infantile, deaf, manifestly crazy\". This is what he discovered. What a fine head of snow-white hair! Demitrios's head was tilted to one side. He glanced at me, as if from an angle; his eye was placatory; his air perplexed. It was midday. Perhaps he had just eaten, and was ready for a nap. I shouted at him, in English: \"Pleased to meet you.\" He was wearing a light-blue T-shirt with L-O-N-D-O-N printed across it. He was dressed below in a pair of jogging trousers, bright green in colour, with white stripes running down the sides of the legs. His stomach showed through the gap between his shirt and trousers. His feet were thrust into narrow, ill-fitting, down-at-heel slippers. His pronunciation of English struck me as odd; I had not imagined that it would sound like this. The intonation was old-fashioned; he had an archaically middle-class accent that took me back to my childhood. I might almost have been listening - had I closed my eyes - to one of the adults I used to hear in those days. Or to a good-natured fatty from one of the British children's books I used to read. Matron Geyer put her head around the corner. Was everything all right? Yes, fine. Demitrios and I sat and smiled at one another, the old man still holding forth, I responding with nods. \"We Greeks were rivals against the Orientals. Very strong rivals. They brought me up very strict against the Orientals, the Arabs especially . . . I was taken out of the French mission school. I was learning the black language there, Shangaan. It was a big mistake. They should have left me but they sent me to a Catholic Portuguese school. And from there they took me out again and sent me to school in Middelburg, in the Transvaal. I had difficulty because of Afrikaans in one class and English in the other. I didn't know Afrikaans. But I kept on, I persisted, I had no choice because my parents were so strict.\" He told the story with evident satisfaction. If he had been some what subdued initially, he was now animated, alert, carried away by his own words. He spoke about his childhood days in Alexandria and the house of his grandmother Tsafandakis. He had long had in his possession a photograph of himself as a little boy, in Arab garb. \"I kept it. I put it in an envelope when I was in Pretoria Central prison. Potgieter, he destroyed it. It disappeared there. I used to keep it, but Potgieter the chief warder destroyed it, also my birth certificate. I had all that. I knew it was historic. But Potgieter was against me, he tore everything up. It would make history, but that stupid Potgieter...\" He trailed off, agitatedly, weeping. Over the following days he repeatedly complained about that incident. \"Potgieter was furious against anything that belonged to me. But his helper was very good to me. I'd like to see him. He sympathised with me and protected me whenever possible, when I was beaten on the skull. Blood used to come in! He was also an Afrikaner, but different.... Completely different, very good-natured,\" he repeated. A little later, clearly referring still to the prison in Pretoria, he said: \"I'd like to go back there, where I used to live in that building. It's been transformed into a holy place now. A hoooly place. You must find out. You must inquire.\" At one point he began to sing to me English songs from 50 and more years ago - for old times' sake, he said, the spittle flying out of the corner of his mouth as he said the phrase. By now he had become positively elated. Among the songs was A Bicycle Made for Two (\"Daisy, Daisy\"). Drawing long breaths, he also burst into a hymn I remembered from my schooldays: \"Onward Christian Soldiers/Marching as to war? With the cross of Jesus/Going on before...\" Weeks later the smell of that visit was still with me. It was the smell of old, unwashed men. The rotten sweetness of uncared-for teeth and unwashed armpits, mixed with the odours of half-digested food rising from the bow els and through the pores of the skin. Demitrios was a neglected creature. That was the truth. Matron Geyer was not to be blamed. There was nothing that she could do about it. The hospital was hopelessly understaffed. Just before I left, he asked: \"Are you an enthusiast of flying?\" The question was wonderfully dated. It belonged, I thought, to an era of golfing caps and plus fours on English greens. The meeting had left me feeling dizzy. I had come assuming that I would meet an extinguished human being. Someone whose illness could only have been exacerbated by three decades of imprisonment and maltreatment.

When he had fallen silent I wrote a few more words on the pad. \"Like a real Cretan,\" Demitrios read slowly. \"Yeah,\" he said calmly. \"Nature, hereditary nature. \"It's nature,\" he said again, with an air of finality. \"Human nature.\" When we said goodbye he pulled me closely to him, embracing me with one of his arms, and pressed, between sobs, a fatherly kiss on my cheek and forehead. Demitrios Tsafendas died on October 7 1999. According to a reliable source, he had insisted on making a will or testament of some sort several years previously. In it he is said to have stipulated that his body should undergo an autopsy, so that his \"worm\" might be exposed to the eyes of science at last. I have been unable to find out whether or not his wishes in this matter were heeded. \u0095 From the book A Mouthful of Glass by Henk van Woerden, translated by Dan Jacobson, published by Granta Books at \u00a312.99.

Oh, those dear, dead, innocent days. Well, not so dead, perhaps. There are still a few practitioners of those dark arts here and there, purveying the same spurious, bastardised version of Italian cooking and pandering to the snobbery and ignorance of a certain class of English eater, who put a higher price on the theatre of the fawning waiter than on decent food. </p> <p>At first sight, Alloro is not like one of these at all. The greeting is polite, not in the least smarmy. The floor is wooden, not tiled. The walls are pale olive green, not white. The wine list is peopled with curiosities from Sardinia and Friuli, not the Vernaccia and Valpolicella of old. The food, too, has had something of a leg-up, what with terrina di verdure grigliate con mozzarella di bufala, gnocchi di patate con gallinacci and petto d'anatra arrosto caramellizato al miele con salsa di vino rosso, to mention just a few of the items on the menu when Angostura and I settled in for lunch. </p> <p>Nothing very surprising about these dishes, you might say. There's nothing very Italian about them, either - and that is the trouble with Alloro, and a raft of new Italian restaurants.

They may be delicious in their own way, but they are not Italian. </p> <p>In the course of a recent trip to southern Italy, I was reminded again and again that the essence of Italian food is its simplicity - or single-mindedness, if you prefer. When you order meat, that's what you get: meat. Ask for fish, and fish appears on the plate, with a slice of lemon. No sauce. No gravy. No vegetables, garnishes, condiments. No distractions. This lack of adornment puts huge emphasis on the quality of the ingredient: it stands entirely by its own excellence, or falls for the lack of it. </p> <p>My first course at Alloro consisted of culatello originale, finocciona, pane carasau and pomodorini secchi. Culatello is cured rump of pork, a speciality of Zibello in Emilia Romagna and one of the most expensive hams to be had. Finocciona is a salame flavoured with fennel, and is characteristic of Tuscany. Pane carasau is Sardinia's answer to Melba toast: very thin and crisp, and very nice when splattered with halves of cherry tomato, which had been partially dried, I would guess, in the oven, there not having been a whole lot of sun in Mayfair recently. There was nothing wrong with any of these elements individually. Indeed, there was a whole lot right with them - silky, subtle culatello; superb, piercing and delicate finocchiona; intense tomatoes with friable bread. The only trouble was having them all on the same plate. It was a kind of Italian fusion food. </p> <p>The same thoughts occurred with the fillet of John Dory with fried potatoes and lemon, olive oil and basil sauce. The fish was superb, tense and muscular, as John Dory should be when fresh, but all it needed was a little lemon juice and salt. The potatoes would have done nicely served separately, and the basil sauce would have done nicely on another dish (although I can't think of one off hand). Angostura's monkfish wrapped in courgette and cooked on a skewer with tomato salad was the same: monkfish - splendid; courgette - fine; tomatoes - just about okay.</p> <p> But what about the unadvertised shavings of fennel? And the green sauce? It could have been a dish in any halfway-decent French restaurant with no specific regional culinary allegiance. The extra-virgin olive oil ice cream that came with strawberries in wine was an ingenious conceit, interesting rather than a giant leap forward in gastronomic pleasure. </p> <p>And that was that. A brace of Bellinis, a bottle of brilliant, floral Vermentino di Capichera from Sardinia, and an unexplained \u00a33.50 surcharge on the monkfish skewer produced a bill of just over \u00a3100, of which the food accounted for \u00a348. Come to think of it, that bill would have been the equivalent of dinner at one of those Da Mimmo's and Trattoria Gennaros of beloved memory.

      "body": "<p>Few colourful shrubs are at their peak of flowering right now. Most that are are white-flowered - don't ask me why - so if you want colourful, ebullient shrubs from late June until the first frosts, hydrangeas are the ones for you. They include whites, but also pink, red, purple, mauve and blue. </p> <p>Last year, mine were pretty miserable, thanks to an April frost that swiped the young growth. This year, however, they are as good as I have ever seen them, and what a show they make. Hydrangeas make rounded bushes, by and large; sometimes very large, but you can control their size by pruning (a subject I like to discuss in March). </p> <p>A point to make here is that rounded hydrangeas, all herded together, cry out for something to break them up. The giant reed grass, Arundo donax , is most satisfactory for this purpose, being tall, narrow and bold, with tiers of wide, blue-grey leaves. </p> <p>In a cool summer, when we are shivering as we did through much of this July, hydrangeas are at their best. They love it - if too hot or dry at the root, they tell you so at once. Their reproachful, wilting looks force you to give them a heavy drenching. By the next morning, they will be radiant, once more. They love plenty of nourishment, too. Heavy mulches should be given in winter, when they are dormant - but not of mushroom compost, which has chalk in it and will turn the foliage yellow. </p> <p>You can also give them a boost in March, at the start of their growing season, with a dose of Growmore fertiliser. From early summer on, give them no manuring at all, as they need to enter winter with as well-ripened shoots as possible; nothing soft and sappy that will be vulnerable to frost. </p> <p>If a hydrangea is non-flowering, the chances are that it is never ripening the growth it made the previous summer. Most, but not all, hydran-geas depend on bringing this intact through winter, so as to flower from it the next year. Hydrangeas are consequently none too satisfactory where winters are unduly cold, though some are tough even then. Hydrangea serrata 'Bluebird' (1m), with lacecap-style flowerheads (big pips or florets surround a disc of small, fertile ones), is outstandingly winter-tough, although it can be clobbered by spring frosts. </p> <p>Most are excellent in maritime areas, which is why our coastal resorts are so full of them - one of the most ebullient is 'Joseph Banks', with huge pale-pink bun-heads on a bush almost as big as the house behind it - or at least that is how it seems from the road in front. </p> <p>Another don't, or won't, with hydrangeas is chalky or in other ways strongly alkaline soil. Their leaves turn yellow and they look thoroughly unhappy. To an extent, if the soil is only slightly alkaline, you can correct the situation with iron sequestrine. On neutral or slightly alkaline soils, most colourful hydrangeas have pink or red flower; red particularly suits some of the more dwarf-like varieties, such as 'Westfalen' (0.7m), whose rich colour takes everyone by surprise. That is a hortensia, which means that it has bun-headed inflorescences. 'Geoffrey Chadbund' (up to 2m) is a red lacecap. </p> <p>On acid soils, the same hydrangeas will be purple, mauve or blue. I find the deeper blues too electric. Light blue is more charming, as in the early and long-flowering 'G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Vicomtesse de Vibraye' (1.5m and generally shortened to 'Vibraye'), which is bun-headed with small pips. When pink, this looks a trifle cheap, I think - on soils that are not too far removed from neutral, you can alter the colour to blue over two growing seasons by applying regular doses of aluminium sulphate from February to June. If your soil is naturally acid, you won't need to bother. </p> <p>I find 'Hamburg' (1m) a most satisfactory hortensia, on my fairly neutral soil, where it makes big, blowsy buns of deep-pink pips. Where these receive plenty of light, they turn to bronze as they fade; if shaded, they turn green. If you wish to dry them for winter decorations, pick in early autumn, as the pink is changing to reddish bronze (or green), and dry them like that. </p> <p>Some hydrangeas have a very long flowering season, thanks to their capacity to keep on producing new flowering shoots. The white hortenisa, 'Mme E Mouill\u00e9re', gets going in late June and often continues into November, if frost holds off. Mid-season, it is worth sprucing up the bush by removing branches that have faded. 'Ayesha' (1.5m and needing shelter) is a long-flowering hortensia, pink on my soil but blue on acid. It is most distinctive for the in-curving margins of the pips, and is often likened to lilac.</p> <p> The old-fashioned 'Nigra' (1.5m) also has a long season. Of rather lax habit (pruning out of the lowest branches corrects this), it has masses of smallish bun-heads in pink or blue, but also the distinguishing feature of black stems.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Elspeth Gibson was planning to work with horses when she grew up, but she ended up designing dresses instead. \"I always loved girly things.\" Femininity, in the old-fashioned, pink-ribbon sense of the word, is hardly a modish trait, but Gibson - all peachy skin and chocolate-button eyes - has made her mark in the fashion world by reinventing girliness.</p> <p> From Alexander McQueen's bumster trousers to the scraps of cobweb that pass for Julien Macdonald's dresses, the London fashion designers now making headlines are characterised by a harsh, abrasive sexuality: unsettling to look at, almost impossible to wear. Quietly, meanwhile, Gibson has been forging a different path, making clothes that flatter rather than overshadow the wearer. </p> <p>Winner of the British Fashion Awards' prestigious New Designer of the Year award two years ago and now a regular fixture at London Fashion Week, she has built a flourishing business on defining and perfecting a luxury-meets-casual look that, it seems, women crave. Her clothes are womanly, practical, yet defiantly romantic. They are also deceptively simple: put on one of her knee-length beaded skirts, and watch the fabric and cut work its magic, conjuring a silver-screen slinkiness out of standard-issue hips and thighs. </p> <p>Gibson herself, 36 and heavily pregnant when we meet - her first child, Evie Scarlett May, has since been born - is similarly deceptive. She has a soft, musical voice and ends almost every sentence with a silly-me giggle or the phrase \"isn't it?\", so that she appears, in conversation, to be perpetually unsure of herself. </p> <p>But, like a true romantic heroine, scratch the surface and discover a will of steel. An assistant who fails to silence a ringing telephone is reprimanded with a swift, terse rebuke; later, in a taxi en route to her Knightsbridge shop, Gibson proves herself to be a bossy backseat driver of the first order. </p> <p>Gibson grew up in the village of East Markham, in Nottinghamshire: her rosy complexion still owes more to the countryside of her childhood than to London, where she has lived for the past 15 years. Her father was an architect, her mother an illustrator, who, among other things, made drawings for Rolls-Royce brochures. As a child, she kept scrapbooks full of pictures that caught her eye, and drew: \"the same shape, a girl with a long dress and a pointed hat\".</p> <p> Her two brothers \"always wanted to watch football, and I wanted to watch Black Beauty and cartoons. Because I was the only girl, I had to fight for things.\" Her grandmother, who had grown up with five sisters, took pity on her and bought her a sewing machine when she was eight. \"It was one of the old hand-powered ones. I made a lot of long tube skirts in printed fabrics with elasticated waists.\" Gibson pauses awhile at the memory of such dubious taste. \"I'm sure they looked ridiculous.\" </p> <p>She divided her affections between the dressing-up box and Pony Club. \"In the countryside, horse-riding gives you freedom. Otherwise, your parents have to take you everywhere. I had two horses, so I spent a lot of time looking after them... and because I spent all my time in wellingtons, I liked the idea of everything being so much more glamorous.\" </p> <p>The drive apparent in the grown-up Elspeth Gibson doesn't seem to have been much in evidence during her teenage years: \"I wasn't too sure what to do... I liked working with horses, but I quite liked the idea of art college, too.\" Her father was keen for her to decide, and she \"ended up\" taking a foundation course at Mansfield College of Art and Design, \"doing everything from printing to pottery to graphics... but before long I felt very strongly about fashion\". </p> <p>After graduating in 1984, Gibson moved to London. At this point, the career of all too many talented young British fashion designers goes something like this: be proclaimed a genius for outlandish and extravagant degree collection, and enjoy glorious but short-lived love affair with the press, then fail to produce clothes on time or pay attention to maintaining viable business, and go under within four years. The harsh fact is that very few young designers manage to build lasting businesses in their own name. Some get snapped up to design for bigger companies, but many more simply go bust and disappear. </p> <p>Gibson's path has been refreshingly different. After completing her foundation course, she landed a placement at Zandra Rhodes, and embarked on a 10-year stint designing for high-street stores, including Top Shop, Miss Selfridge and Monix, before launching her own label. \"I wanted to find out how to run a business. Designing for the high street, you have to find fabrics that look good but are cheap, and be really careful with how you use them - when you're cutting thousands, every centimetre counts. Designing is the easy side, and the nicest side. The hard bit is keeping a company going season after season.\" </p> <p>Elspeth Gibson London was launched in 1995. Success came relatively quickly, but the early days were nerve-racking none the less. \"I went from being the head designer for a company [Monix] to working at home alone with a part-time sample machinist. It was very scary. My first collection was about six pieces, and I took them to Liberty, Harvey Nichols and Tokio. Liberty bought a few pieces, and I was over the moon.\" </p> <p> Interest began to grow when Gibson showed an early collection on a stand at the London Designers' Exhibition that accompanies London Fashion Week. A stylist at Vogue saw the clothes, loved them, and brought others to meet Gibson; a buzz started. It was at this time, around four years ago, that Gibson met her now close friend, handbag designer Anya Hindmarch. \"Everyone was talking about her, so I went to check out her stuff and loved it,\" says Hindmarch. \"Things were going back to being pretty and feminine, and Elspeth was very much at the forefront of that. And she's so lovely, you can't help but adore her.\" </p> <p>By 1997, Gibson's star was rising further, helped by the support of British Vogue, whose editor, Alexandra Shulman, declared that \"the most commonly bought item in the Vogue offices this season is an Elspeth Gibson skirt... they seem to strike the right balance, looking modern and different without being too extreme\". </p> <p>The following year, Gibson staged her first fashion show, and opened an Elspeth Gibson boutique in Pont Street, Knightsbridge; last year, turnover grew to more than \u00a31 million. She is one of the few young British designers to to be taken seriously in the lucrative US fashion market - Saks Fifth Avenue does good business selling her clothes. \"Americans like to look womanly,\" says Gibson. \"They seem to buy the glam side of my collection.\" </p> <p>Gibson has an uncommon gift for creating clothes that tread the thin line between pretty and twee, and is far more influential than she is generally given credit for: over the past five years, she has introduced an evening-wear \"look\" of a fluid beaded or embroidered skirt or dress worn with simple knitwear that has become something of a uniform among a certain set of chic women who want to look gorgeous but would not be seen dead in an \"obvious\" dress. \"You always feel sexy in Elspeth's clothes,\" says one devotee, \"and you never look like you've tried too hard.\" </p> <p>Gibson herself is unusually pretty, petite and cherubic rather than tall and skinny, so she can sympathise more than most fashion designers with women's concerns about their bodies. Her clothes flatter and forgive. What is more, many of them actually look better when they have some curves to hug. On the catwalk, however, Gibson's clothes are still modelled by the classic tall, thin girls, and most of her clothes are bought in relatively small sizes.</p> <p> \"I need to sell clothes to make money, so of course I don't just make size 8s. But the funny thing is that when stores come in to buy, they always go for the 8s, 10s, 12s. Most don't even order any size 14s. We sell size 14 in our shop, but we sell two or three times as many size 10s as size 14s.\" </p> <p>She is not immune from feeling body-image pressure. Examining the polaroids of her taken by the photographer who is shooting her portrait for this interview, she is worried that she looks fat. \"You will mention that I'm pregnant, won't you?\" </p> <p>There is daywear in Gibson's collection - gingham sun dresses, colourful T-shirts - but even the simplest pieces have a luxurious edge borne out of the designer's love of the best fabrics. With fabrics sometimes costing over \u00a3200 a metre, Gibson's clothes can be prohibitively priced: \u00a3500 is not unusual for a skirt, say. Such luxury requires discipline in other areas: these fabrics are cut in Gibson's Islington studio, where the samples are made. \"We can't afford to make mistakes,\" she says simply - the business is healthy, but it is still small enough for a wasted \u00a3200 piece of fabric to constitute a problem. </p> <p>More affordable is the Sweetpea range for girls aged three to eight, which Gibson designs for Debenhams. \"Debenhams have been really good to me\" - the store has sponsored Gibson's show for three years - \"and I felt we could work together on the childrenswear, because childrenswear really is different. Because it's such small sizes, you can use good-quality fabrics... but I wanted it to be practical, too. I asked all my friends with children about that.\" </p> <p>It was soon after designing the first Sweetpea collection that Gibson became pregnant. She asked about the sex of the child because, \"with everything in our industry being so changeable, I wanted something that was set\". So she knew already she was expecting a girl; she is, by her own admission, \"looking forward to dressing her up\", but has no intention of encouraging her daughter, now two months old, to follow in her footsteps. \"Oh no - I want her to do something totally different. I think she'd be more sensible going into something like the stock market. I'd let her decide but... I wouldn't recommend being a designer. I'd want her to have an easier life.\" </p> <p>Today, she is wearing a Paul Smith men's V-neck jumper taken from the wardrobe of her husband, Dominic, who works alongside her in the Islington studio four days a week, running the financial side of the company; on the fifth day, he continues to practise his first profession, dentistry. They met through a friend, at a birthday lunch. \"We weren't attracted to each other at all,\" she says matter-of-factly. \"I never thought we'd be together, and he didn't, either. It's funny how things work out. We knew each other for about a year, and then got together.\" </p> <p>They now live in north London, a few roads away from where Dominic grew up. Together, they have an air of frightening efficiency. When they decided to have a baby, Dominic worked out that the only practical way they could cope with a baby born this year was if it were to be born in the relative lull between seasons, in May. \"Dominic told me last year we had a window of a few weeks in the autumn when hopefully it would happen, and if it didn't we were going to have to wait another six months.\" Evie happened, right on cue. A very Elspeth Gibson story: practicality with a fairy-tale ending</p>",

She is one of the few young British designers to to be taken seriously in the lucrative US fashion market - Saks Fifth Avenue does good business selling her clothes. \"Americans like to look womanly,\" says Gibson. \"They seem to buy the glam side of my collection.\" Gibson has an uncommon gift for creating clothes that tread the thin line between pretty and twee, and is far more influential than she is generally given credit for: over the past five years, she has introduced an evening-wear \"look\" of a fluid beaded or embroidered skirt or dress worn with simple knitwear that has become something of a uniform among a certain set of chic women who want to look gorgeous but would not be seen dead in an \"obvious\" dress. \"You always feel sexy in Elspeth's clothes,\" says one devotee, \"and you never look like you've tried too hard.\" Gibson herself is unusually pretty, petite and cherubic rather than tall and skinny, so she can sympathise more than most fashion designers with women's concerns about their bodies. Her clothes flatter and forgive. What is more, many of them actually look better when they have some curves to hug. On the catwalk, however, Gibson's clothes are still modelled by the classic tall, thin girls, and most of her clothes are bought in relatively small sizes. \"I need to sell clothes to make money, so of course I don't just make size 8s. But the funny thing is that when stores come in to buy, they always go for the 8s, 10s, 12s. Most don't even order any size 14s. We sell size 14 in our shop, but we sell two or three times as many size 10s as size 14s.\" She is not immune from feeling body-image pressure. Examining the polaroids of her taken by the photographer who is shooting her portrait for this interview, she is worried that she looks fat. \"You will mention that I'm pregnant, won't you?\" There is daywear in Gibson's collection - gingham sun dresses, colourful T-shirts - but even the simplest pieces have a luxurious edge borne out of the designer's love of the best fabrics. With fabrics sometimes costing over \u00a3200 a metre, Gibson's clothes can be prohibitively priced: \u00a3500 is not unusual for a skirt, say. Such luxury requires discipline in other areas: these fabrics are cut in Gibson's Islington studio, where the samples are made. \"We can't afford to make mistakes,\" she says simply - the business is healthy, but it is still small enough for a wasted \u00a3200 piece of fabric to constitute a problem. More affordable is the Sweetpea range for girls aged three to eight, which Gibson designs for Debenhams. \"Debenhams have been really good to me\" - the store has sponsored Gibson's show for three years - \"and I felt we could work together on the childrenswear, because childrenswear really is different. Because it's such small sizes, you can use good-quality fabrics... but I wanted it to be practical, too. I asked all my friends with children about that.\" It was soon after designing the first Sweetpea collection that Gibson became pregnant. She asked about the sex of the child because, \"with everything in our industry being so changeable, I wanted something that was set\". So she knew already she was expecting a girl; she is, by her own admission, \"looking forward to dressing her up\", but has no intention of encouraging her daughter, now two months old, to follow in her footsteps. \"Oh no - I want her to do something totally different. I think she'd be more sensible going into something like the stock market. I'd let her decide but... I wouldn't recommend being a designer. I'd want her to have an easier life.\" Today, she is wearing a Paul Smith men's V-neck jumper taken from the wardrobe of her husband, Dominic, who works alongside her in the Islington studio four days a week, running the financial side of the company; on the fifth day, he continues to practise his first profession, dentistry. They met through a friend, at a birthday lunch. \"We weren't attracted to each other at all,\" she says matter-of-factly. \"I never thought we'd be together, and he didn't, either. It's funny how things work out. We knew each other for about a year, and then got together.\" They now live in north London, a few roads away from where Dominic grew up. Together, they have an air of frightening efficiency. When they decided to have a baby, Dominic worked out that the only practical way they could cope with a baby born this year was if it were to be born in the relative lull between seasons, in May. \"Dominic told me last year we had a window of a few weeks in the autumn when hopefully it would happen, and if it didn't we were going to have to wait another six months.\" Evie happened, right on cue. A very Elspeth Gibson story: practicality with a fairy-tale ending",

      "body": "<p> People keep sending Ed Shultz teabags - some already used. In the past five months, hundreds of them have been sent to the chief executive of Smith &amp; Wesson in a mailbag otherwise full of abuse.</p> <p>A used teabag might seem like an odd way to insult the head of a leading handgun manufacturer. But when Shultz broke ranks with the American gun lobby in an agreement to curb the way his company makes and sells firearms, a wave of xenophobia generated by the fact that Smith &amp; Wesson is owned by British conglomerate Tomkins was released.</p> <p>The gun lobby was able to make a direct link between Britain's decision to ban handguns with what it considered this latest threat to the constitutional right of all Americans to bear arms. </p> <p>Charlton Heston, the head of the National Rifle Association, thundered: \"Smith &amp; Wesson is a good company and a fine, old American name, but they're owned by the Brits. I don't really relish the idea of the Brits telling us how to deal with one part of our Bill of Rights. I thought we settled that in 1776.\" </p> <p>Soon after the teabags began arriving - a reference to the Boston Tea Party - and a consumer boycott of Smith &amp; Wesson guns gathered momentum. After nine years as a hate figure for anti-gun campaigners Shultz is still coming to terms with his status as a traitor. \"Our opponents are spinning us as somehow a British controlled company. They have projected me as some kind of a British citizen, controlled by the British government,\" said the 58-year-old native of Iowa. Shultz refuses to discuss his family or to even allude to where he lives. Security at Smith &amp; Wesson's ugly, squat headquarters at Springfield, Massachusetts, is tight.</p> <p>Into the firefight Tomkins has lobbed the fact that it wants to sell its subsidiary. The group has decided that at a contribution level of 1% to revenues, the troublesome firm is not part of its core business. The decision to rationalise its operations has been welcomed by the City, but few analysts believe finding a buyer in a stagnant industry at the centre of a legal nightmare is going to be easy.</p> <p>After Tomkins reiterated its desire to divest non-core operations at its results announcement last month, Shultz received a couple of calls from potential buyers. He sent them straight on to merger specialists at the parent company. But sources close to Tomkins say a deal is likely to be some way off. Shultz says that the sale of his company is \"not likely to be a number one priority\" for Tomkins - which is going through a management as well as corporate reshuffle. Advisers believe its continuing legal woes are likely to deter prospective buyers. </p> <p>For while Shultz's decision to change the way he makes and sells guns has brought opprobrium from gun owners, it has only helped settle some of the lawsuits Tomkins faces. Many more, from states as well as individuals, are pending. Anti-gun campaigners also believe that the agreement does not go far enough and simply reinforces what the company is already doing. </p> <p><strong>Language of war</strong></p> <p>During an interview of almost three hours in his spartan office, Shultz often uses the language of war to describe his predicament. \"In first world war terms, we are in no man's land being attacked by both sides,\" he said. In the accord, reached with federal agencies on behalf of state authorities during March, Smith &amp; Wesson agreed to adopt safety measures such as equipping new guns with trigger locks and exerting greater control over who buys them. The company has also agreed to develop so-called \"smart-gun technology\" using fingerprints to identify users.</p> <p>Shultz's defence against his opponents in the gun lobby is twofold. First, he argues that he had no choice. Smith &amp; Wesson, with estimated undisclosed annual sales of about \u00a3100m, baulked at the threat of continuing legal costs. Ground-breaking awards against that other pariah industry, tobacco, helped convince Shultz he had done the right thing. </p> <p>Asked if he had any regrets about signing the pact, Shultz says no very clearly before adding: \"It was the only reasonable alternative we had.\" His second line of defence is that the company had to change to deal with a changing society and new market dynamics. This has been hard for many gun owners to accept. Among the more blood-curdling complaints made via the net is one suggesting some of the new curbs would allow the Clinton administration to collect information about gun owners.</p> <p>Shultz, a lifetime Republican who can hardly say the word Clinton without curling his lip, describes this as part of the \"spin\" disseminated by his opponents. He compares the new rules for gun distributors as akin to making sure someone can drive before giving them a car. </p> <p>There has been \"tremendous support from the public\" for his stance, he says. \"Here in the US, a significant percentage of the voting population agrees with us.\" He has even received supportive letters from the UK - a fact unlikely to surprise Charlton Heston.</p> <p>Short and stocky, and wearing a short-sleeved shirt bearing the corporate logo, Shultz is on the defensive when talking about his company. But his speech becomes rapid and philosophical when he discusses the changing nature of the world around him. </p> <p>Born on a farm in the mid-west just after the US entered the second world war, guns were \"a part of life\". His father taught him \"the rules\", such as each round bringing back something to eat or never firing across water. \"I grew up hunting and trapping. When you get a skunk in your mink trap, you need a gun.\" A grandfather of two, Shultz can list all the shootings that have shocked the US and led to calls for stiffer gun laws. An owner of \"dozens\" of guns, he objects to the way the public thinks a handgun played a part in the Columbine school shooting when 30-year-old shotguns were used. But, he adds, \"Boys in the schoolyard used to beat each other up, they did not run each other down after school.\" </p> <p>He cites increasing urbanisation, the end of military service and the decline of the traditional family as reasons for decreasing gun sales. While some estimates put the number of guns as high as the number of people in the US, he says the market peaked in 1995 as the gun-owning population stockpiled weapons to head off the threat of new legislation. </p> <p>Shultz says this changing society has led to the legal and business difficulties which face his industry and others. \"People don't smoke and they don't shoot any more and they sit on juries ... Through elected officials they are already changing these things. If we are perceived by the public to be reluctant to do anything they will just vote us out of existence.\" \"This industry can either move forward or stay obsolete. Smith &amp; Wesson is one of the oldest companies in the US, it was started in 1852. It did not survive into its 149th year by failing to adapt to change.\"</p> <p>For all his adaptability, Shultz has a passion for gun owning hard to imagine in anyone outside the US. \"My guns will never be confiscated in my lifetime, because the last thing I would do is have a shoot-out. I believe that it's an absolute right for me to have them and if they [government forces] went that far I would be willing to give up my life, as I wouldn't want to live here anyway.\" The industry has always seen Shultz as an outsider. After graduating as an engineer, he spent his early career working in a shop fixtures business and then an office furniture manufacturer before being hired by Tomkins in 1992. Since March, Smith &amp; Wesson has offered discounts and closed its plant for an annual break - both seized upon by the NRA as signs of financial distress. Anecdotal evidence suggests sales have been hit by the boycott, but it is difficult to know to what extent. Shultz, in a rare attempt at humour, says: \"Reports of our demise by folks doing the boycott have been exaggerated.\"</p> <p><strong> Berretta rumours </strong></p> <p>When the agreement was signed several industry pundits expected other gun makers to follow suit. Austrian-owned Glock and Italian Berretta were rumoured as potential signatories. Now, nobody expects anything to happen until after the presidential election. The gun lobby has long supported the Republican party. Dick Cheney, the vice-presidential candidate, is rare even among conservative politicians in never having voted for any gun restrictions. </p> <p>Shultz says even a Bush presidency would not change the way the wind is blowing. \"The government cannot stop states or cities, and it certainly cannot stop individuals from bringing their own actions.\" Cynical about what he calls \"spin\" on both sides, he says, \"At the federal level this is a good political issue because politicians can take a position - and there is virtually nothing they can do about it.\"</p> <p>Shultz says he considered taking his first holiday in five years\" this month but it \"didn't work out\". Instead, he expects to continue to add two hours to each working day, replying to the most reasoned or heartfelt correspondence he gets. Asked if he would consider a management buy-out of some kind, he thinks for a while before saying that if he were an investment professional it \"would probably be [in] some kind of internet company\". </p> <p><strong>The CV</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Born </strong> On a hog, or pig, farm in Iowa, in 1941.</p> <p><strong> Education </strong> First studied in a \"one-room schoolhouse\"; studied engineering at Iowa State University before training to become a registered professional engineer.</p> <p><strong> Career </strong> Began in the construction machinery industry, progressing to outdoor power and recreational equipment; in <strong> 1979 </strong> joined Lozier Corporation, a store fixtures business of which he eventually became president; in <strong> 1989 </strong> became president of Hon Company, an office furniture firm; in <strong> 1992 </strong>, joined Tomkins as president and chief executive of Smith &amp; Wesson \u00ca there, in <strong> 1994 </strong>, he was given responsibility for all professional, gardening and leisure businesses in the US . </p> <p><strong> Family</strong> Two children, two grandchildren.</p>",

Shultz says even a Bush presidency would not change the way the wind is blowing. \"The government cannot stop states or cities, and it certainly cannot stop individuals from bringing their own actions.\" Cynical about what he calls \"spin\" on both sides, he says, \"At the federal level this is a good political issue because politicians can take a position - and there is virtually nothing they can do about it.\" Shultz says he considered taking his first holiday in five years\" this month but it \"didn't work out\". Instead, he expects to continue to add two hours to each working day, replying to the most reasoned or heartfelt correspondence he gets. Asked if he would consider a management buy-out of some kind, he thinks for a while before saying that if he were an investment professional it \"would probably be [in] some kind of internet company\".

Four warders were suspended from duty. Martin Narey, the director general of the prison service, took the decision after receiving a dossier from the penal reform group the Howard League, alleging assaults on 15 inmates, some as young as 15. The allegations stretch back to 1986 and one teenager claims he was assaulted a fortnight ago at the Dorset jail, which houses, on average, 543 inmates aged 15-21. Two serving staff members and one former employee have backed up the claims that a systematically violent regime operates at the youth jail. Prison reformers say the allegations of brutality are the worst levelled against a youth prison in modern times. In statements seen by the Guardian, inmates claim they were kicked and punched by officers, and two have told of hearing screams echoing through sections of the Victorian jail following beatings being meted out by officers. The prison service said yesterday that four officers had been suspended over the allegations. Detectives are investigating the claims of six former inmates who say they were assaulted between December 1997 and March 2000 and have begun legal action. One former prisoner who is willing to give evidence to police, claimed that as a 19-year-old inmate at Portland in 1993 he was assaulted five times.

In November last year the Guardian reported claims of brutality from an earlier Howard League dossier. However, none of the ex-inmates making the allegations wanted to be named and Mr Narey decided no inquiry was possible. In March Sir David Ramsbotham, the chief inspector of prisons, described conditions at Portland as a \"moral outrage\" and condemned the jail's treatment of young offenders. In a statement Mr Narey said: \"While being confident that the humanity of Portland has been radically improved by the new governor, I remain extremely concerned about the allegations of abuse.\" The Howard League, which wants an independent inquiry into Portland, passed their new dossier to Mr Narey at a meeting on Wednesday.

His chances of getting that suffered another blow on Wednesday when Southgate appeared in the Intertoto Cup against Celta Vigo, making him ineligible to play for Chelsea in the Uefa Cup. </p> <p>Moreover, Villa may have to settle for less out of economic necessity. The club made a loss on last season of \u00a34.8m and Wednesday's defeat has seen the club's shares hit an all-time low. Valued at more than \u00a311 each at flotation, they now stand at \u00a33.35. </p> <p>Paulo Wanchope is expected to complete his club-record \u00a34m transfer from West Ham to Manchester City on Monday despite Bradford City's best efforts to gazump the move. </p> <p>Bradford have matched City's offer and agreed to meet Wanchope's pay demands, but their chairman Geoffrey Richmond believes the chance to team up with George Weah at Maine Road will be too much for the striker to turn down. </p> <p>\"My gut feeling is that our chances are something less than 50-50, the reason being that there is every possibility he will decide to join what is perceived to be a bigger club,\" said Richmond. </p> <p>Middlesbrough are waiting to discover whether Alen Boksic's reputation is enough to earn him a work permit. </p> <p>The Croatian striker needs clearance from the Department for Employment and Education after agreeing a \u00a32.5m transfer from Lazio. And although Boro have been assured there should be no problem obtaining a work permit, Boksic's lack of international action over the past two years means he does not meet the criteria. </p> <p>If his application were rejected, the club would have to lodge an official appeal arguing that the player's reputation leaves no doubt as to his quality. Last season they used the same route to complete the loan signing of Juninho from Atletico Madrid. </p> <p>Robbie Fowler's worst fears were realised yesterday when he was told to rest his badly damaged ankle for between four and six weeks, meaning it might be October before he can return for Liverpool. </p> <p>It seems probable the striker will be forced to sit out the opening eight league games of the season and miss England's World Cup qualifier against Germany in October. </p> <p>Fowler was flown home from Liverpool's pre-season tour of Northern Ireland yesterday after straining ligaments in his right ankle in an accidental collision with the Glentoran goalkeeper on Thursday. </p> <p>Newcastle's striker Temuri Ketsbaia will join Wolves for \u00a3900,000 on a two-year contract, subject to a medical and a work permit, but Wolves have had a \u00a31m bid for the Nottingham Forest striker Marlon Harewood rejected. </p> <p>Niall Quinn expects to finish his career at Sunderland after finalising the details of a new three-year contract. </p> <p>The Leeds forward Harry Kewell may need an operation on a long-standing achilles problem and that would rule him out of the opening month of the season.</p>",

Bradford have matched City's offer and agreed to meet Wanchope's pay demands, but their chairman Geoffrey Richmond believes the chance to team up with George Weah at Maine Road will be too much for the striker to turn down. \"My gut feeling is that our chances are something less than 50-50, the reason being that there is every possibility he will decide to join what is perceived to be a bigger club,\" said Richmond. Middlesbrough are waiting to discover whether Alen Boksic's reputation is enough to earn him a work permit. The Croatian striker needs clearance from the Department for Employment and Education after agreeing a \u00a32.5m transfer from Lazio. And although Boro have been assured there should be no problem obtaining a work permit, Boksic's lack of international action over the past two years means he does not meet the criteria. If his application were rejected, the club would have to lodge an official appeal arguing that the player's reputation leaves no doubt as to his quality. Last season they used the same route to complete the loan signing of Juninho from Atletico Madrid. Robbie Fowler's worst fears were realised yesterday when he was told to rest his badly damaged ankle for between four and six weeks, meaning it might be October before he can return for Liverpool. It seems probable the striker will be forced to sit out the opening eight league games of the season and miss England's World Cup qualifier against Germany in October. Fowler was flown home from Liverpool's pre-season tour of Northern Ireland yesterday after straining ligaments in his right ankle in an accidental collision with the Glentoran goalkeeper on Thursday. Newcastle's striker Temuri Ketsbaia will join Wolves for \u00a3900,000 on a two-year contract, subject to a medical and a work permit, but Wolves have had a \u00a31m bid for the Nottingham Forest striker Marlon Harewood rejected. Niall Quinn expects to finish his career at Sunderland after finalising the details of a new three-year contract. The Leeds forward Harry Kewell may need an operation on a long-standing achilles problem and that would rule him out of the opening month of the season.",

      "body": "<p>On the tube train to Heathrow, a couple of people stole a curious glance at Ron Strank as he talked to me about his lack of financial rights, as a gay man. Three hours later, on the airport train into Centraal Station in Amsterdam, no one even blinked at a similar conversation. It's symptomatic of the difference in attitude in the two capitals. Less obvious is the tangible difference in the financial treatment of individuals who live as couples, outside marriage. </p> <p>Sixty-seven-year-old Ron and his partner Roger Fisher recently celebrated their 40th anniversary together. Each has an NHS pension, but neither would inherit any benefits from the pension scheme if the other member of the couple dies first. That's because the NHS pension scheme recognises only a spouse as eligible for a survivor's pension, and that means a husband or wife. </p> <p>None of the UK's public sector pension schemes provides partners' pensions, though a programme being broadcast today on Radio 4 outlines how the situation is now changing for many company pensions. Ron only discovered his predicament after a casual conversation with a friend. \"My reaction,\" he said, \"Was one of disbelief, and surprise at myself, because I thought I was fairly sophisticated about these things.\" </p> <p>Ron or Roger would also be subject to inheritance tax if one of them dies and leaves the other more than \u00a3234,000; married partners who leave money and property to each other are exempt from this tax. Of course, their financial problems don't just affect gay couples. Greater numbers of heterosexual couples are in the same boat, though they do at least have a choice of taking the obvious solution - a walk down the aisle. </p> <p>Ron and Roger don't have that option. Neither do gay couples in the Netherlands, but there the law takes a very different view of relationships outside marriage. Ron travelled there to see what life is like under such a legal system and to meet a lesbian couple, Jeanette Drost and Jeanine van der Sanden, who live in Haarlem. </p> <p>They explained to Ron that they had gone to a solicitor to draw up an agreement, recognised under Dutch law. That means that each would be entitled to benefits from the other's pension schemes and, since they could prove they had lived together for five years, they would be subject to a reduced rate of inheritance tax, the same regime that applies to married couples. They were outraged when they heard Ron and Roger had no such protection under British law. \"You're paying as much as the next guy or woman, you should get the same rights,\" says Jeanine. \"It's a great injustice.\" </p> <p>Jeanette and Jeanine could have taken another route to protect their finances. Since 1998, gay and straight couples in the Netherlands have been able to record their relationships in a register, a process very similar to marriage, but according to Jeanette, \"not so romantic\". This confers all the legal benefits of marriage. But the two women are waiting for another change in the law. They want to have a white wedding when gay marriage becomes legal in the Netherlands, a move expected next year. </p> <p>Back in Britain, we took Ron to the public sector union Unison to see Glyn Jenkins, its senior pensions officer. Ron was hoping that there might be changes in sight in the way public sector pension schemes operate. Glyn Jenkins said the NHS scheme is under review and ministers will look at proposals for partners' pensions next year. What shape would reform take in the big public sector schemes for teachers, civil servants and health workers? </p> <p>It's expected that revised pension schemes might be set up for staff who are still working, which would offer survivors' pensions for unmarried partners. However, the government has hinted it will do so only if members of the schemes bear the extra cost involved, which might mean they would have to pay a larger proportion of their salaries into the pension scheme. </p> <p>Glyn Jenkins argues that partner's pensions won't cost the public purse any extra because past actuarial assumptions had forecast that the vast majority of us would marry. Glyn estimates that, in fact, 30%-40% of members of these schemes now live outside marriage, meaning that benefits for partners would not bring additional costs. </p> <p>Would partners' pensions be implemented for retired staff like Ron? Glyn Jenkins admitted that would be a hard battle to fight and win. </p> <p>Ron was philosophical. But he decided to try one more tack - to see a civil liberties lawyer. He talked to Di Luping at Liberty. She looked at his details and told him Liberty would consider taking on his case for discrimination to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg or here in the UK, under the new Human Rights Act which comes into force in October. But it might take years to come to court and would be unlikely to help Ron and Roger themselves. </p> <p>Ron was not put off. He concluded the biggest battle was to wake up millions of people, gay and straight, to the financial problems they might meet at the most vulnerable time in their lives. </p> <p>\u0095 Inside Money, Radio 4, 12 noon today, repeated on Monday August 7 at 3pm.</p>",

Three hours later, on the airport train into Centraal Station in Amsterdam, no one even blinked at a similar conversation. It's symptomatic of the difference in attitude in the two capitals. Less obvious is the tangible difference in the financial treatment of individuals who live as couples, outside marriage. Sixty-seven-year-old Ron and his partner Roger Fisher recently celebrated their 40th anniversary together. Each has an NHS pension, but neither would inherit any benefits from the pension scheme if the other member of the couple dies first. That's because the NHS pension scheme recognises only a spouse as eligible for a survivor's pension, and that means a husband or wife. None of the UK's public sector pension schemes provides partners' pensions, though a programme being broadcast today on Radio 4 outlines how the situation is now changing for many company pensions. Ron only discovered his predicament after a casual conversation with a friend. \"My reaction,\" he said, \"Was one of disbelief, and surprise at myself, because I thought I was fairly sophisticated about these things.\" Ron or Roger would also be subject to inheritance tax if one of them dies and leaves the other more than \u00a3234,000; married partners who leave money and property to each other are exempt from this tax. Of course, their financial problems don't just affect gay couples. Greater numbers of heterosexual couples are in the same boat, though they do at least have a choice of taking the obvious solution - a walk down the aisle. Ron and Roger don't have that option. Neither do gay couples in the Netherlands, but there the law takes a very different view of relationships outside marriage. Ron travelled there to see what life is like under such a legal system and to meet a lesbian couple, Jeanette Drost and Jeanine van der Sanden, who live in Haarlem. They explained to Ron that they had gone to a solicitor to draw up an agreement, recognised under Dutch law. That means that each would be entitled to benefits from the other's pension schemes and, since they could prove they had lived together for five years, they would be subject to a reduced rate of inheritance tax, the same regime that applies to married couples. They were outraged when they heard Ron and Roger had no such protection under British law. \"You're paying as much as the next guy or woman, you should get the same rights,\" says Jeanine. \"It's a great injustice.\" Jeanette and Jeanine could have taken another route to protect their finances. Since 1998, gay and straight couples in the Netherlands have been able to record their relationships in a register, a process very similar to marriage, but according to Jeanette, \"not so romantic\". This confers all the legal benefits of marriage. But the two women are waiting for another change in the law. They want to have a white wedding when gay marriage becomes legal in the Netherlands, a move expected next year. Back in Britain, we took Ron to the public sector union Unison to see Glyn Jenkins, its senior pensions officer. Ron was hoping that there might be changes in sight in the way public sector pension schemes operate. Glyn Jenkins said the NHS scheme is under review and ministers will look at proposals for partners' pensions next year. What shape would reform take in the big public sector schemes for teachers, civil servants and health workers? It's expected that revised pension schemes might be set up for staff who are still working, which would offer survivors' pensions for unmarried partners. However, the government has hinted it will do so only if members of the schemes bear the extra cost involved, which might mean they would have to pay a larger proportion of their salaries into the pension scheme. Glyn Jenkins argues that partner's pensions won't cost the public purse any extra because past actuarial assumptions had forecast that the vast majority of us would marry. Glyn estimates that, in fact, 30%-40% of members of these schemes now live outside marriage, meaning that benefits for partners would not bring additional costs. Would partners' pensions be implemented for retired staff like Ron? Glyn Jenkins admitted that would be a hard battle to fight and win. Ron was philosophical. But he decided to try one more tack - to see a civil liberties lawyer. He talked to Di Luping at Liberty. She looked at his details and told him Liberty would consider taking on his case for discrimination to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg or here in the UK, under the new Human Rights Act which comes into force in October. But it might take years to come to court and would be unlikely to help Ron and Roger themselves. Ron was not put off. He concluded the biggest battle was to wake up millions of people, gay and straight, to the financial problems they might meet at the most vulnerable time in their lives. \u0095 Inside Money, Radio 4, 12 noon today, repeated on Monday August 7 at 3pm.",

Mr Bush reaffirmed his intention to launch upon the world a new generation of tactical and strategic defensive missiles, no matter what the Russians, Chinese (and America's Nato allies) may say.

While accusing the Democrats of squandering the opportunities presented by almost a decade of prosperity, Mr Bush (and Condoleezza Rice, his likely national security adviser) squandered the chance to reassure allies that they would steady the Republican lurch towards America First neo-isolationism. The nominee, ritually positioning himself as a Washington outsider, pledged to renew bipartisan politics, ignoring the fact that it was the party whose standard he now carries which wilfully smashed congressional consensus in the mid-1990s, culminating in its polarising impeachment vendetta against Mr Clinton.</p> <p>But to concentrate on policy is to miss the whole thrust of this week's glitzy-tawdry Philadelphia stage performance. It would be like reviewing The Graduate without noticing that Jerry Hall has taken her clothes off. Rehabilitation is indeed the name of the game for a Republican party which drank deep of the politics of division after its 1992 defeat, which over-indulged in the heady iconoclasm of Newt Gingrich and the noxious nationalism of Pat Buchanan, and which got high (but no nearer to God or the electorate) on the prating dogmas of the evangelical Christian right. By patronising ethnic minorities, by groping for women voters, by their sudden discovery of \"inclusion\", and by their unconvincing charge to the middle ground, the GOP's leaders have sought to make amends, to show that they are now clean, sober, and ready to rule. But slogans, spin and an expedient, platform-imposed unity do not render these 12-step Republicans believable or trustworthy. And the pretend president, George Bush Junior, has yet to show that he is a man of substance.</p>",

But at the same time, he and other keynote speakers, apparently unaware of the contradiction, railed against the very administration whose economic stewardship has made such lavish spending programmes possible. They condemned Mr Clinton's lack of foreign policy focus, but said little about how they would handle the real, current challenges of fair trade, debt relief, peacemaking, and multilateral intervention (though they are adamant that US troops will never serve under UN command). While accusing the Democrats of squandering the opportunities presented by almost a decade of prosperity, Mr Bush (and Condoleezza Rice, his likely national security adviser) squandered the chance to reassure allies that they would steady the Republican lurch towards America First neo-isolationism. The nominee, ritually positioning himself as a Washington outsider, pledged to renew bipartisan politics, ignoring the fact that it was the party whose standard he now carries which wilfully smashed congressional consensus in the mid-1990s, culminating in its polarising impeachment vendetta against Mr Clinton. But to concentrate on policy is to miss the whole thrust of this week's glitzy-tawdry Philadelphia stage performance. It would be like reviewing The Graduate without noticing that Jerry Hall has taken her clothes off. Rehabilitation is indeed the name of the game for a Republican party which drank deep of the politics of division after its 1992 defeat, which over-indulged in the heady iconoclasm of Newt Gingrich and the noxious nationalism of Pat Buchanan, and which got high (but no nearer to God or the electorate) on the prating dogmas of the evangelical Christian right. By patronising ethnic minorities, by groping for women voters, by their sudden discovery of \"inclusion\", and by their unconvincing charge to the middle ground, the GOP's leaders have sought to make amends, to show that they are now clean, sober, and ready to rule. But slogans, spin and an expedient, platform-imposed unity do not render these 12-step Republicans believable or trustworthy. And the pretend president, George Bush Junior, has yet to show that he is a man of substance.",

      "bodyText": "Sean Sloan says this week's Barclays blunder has left him feeling a lot less confident about online banking. Mr Sloan, 32, was one of those who logged on to the bank's net service on Monday morning and suddenly found himself staring at another customer's account details, writes Rupert Jones . \"This someone had a business account and a personal account. I could see all the balances, account numbers and sort codes.\" He was able to see that the person had made a payment the day before for \u00a313,000. The screen also offered a number of options such as transferring funds or making payments. \"I realised Barclays must have made a mistake. The first thing I wanted to do was get out of there - if funds did go missing from this account, I didn't want to be blamed for it. So I got out,\" says Mr Sloan, of Tottenham, north London, a director of a company called Snowchicken who works from home. He ran downstairs and phoned Barclays' helpdesk - it was 8.30am. \"I told them I was really concerned - if I can see someone else's details, what's stopping someone seeing my details and transferring funds?\" He was told someone would phone him back. But despite ringing again, by mid-afternoon he had still heard nothing. When he mentioned the BBC had been round to film him for that night's news, the bank's head of online banking called back and couldn't apologise enough. He says Barclays should have shut the service down sooner. He adds: \"I enjoy online banking - it saves me standing in queues. But this has put doubts in my mind. If it can happen once, what's to stop it happening again?\" The bank says: \"Our service is safe. We have not had these problems before. We invest a lot in our security systems and are committed to ensuring this does not happen again.\"",

      "bodyText": "Research to be outlined at a conference beginning today is likely to fuel the controversy over whether girls should sing in Britain's cathedral choirs. Some cathedrals, including Salisbury and Winchester, have recruited girls but do not let them sing alongside boys. Others, including Manchester and St Mary's in Edinburgh, have created fully integrated choirs. The sight of girls wearing surplices and invading choirstalls which for centuries have been hogged by boys has alarmed church music conservatives. This weekend academics from all over the world will be told that many listeners to tapes can work out whether the treble line is being sung by girls or boys. Most of those tested thought girls \"made a very acceptable sound\". David Howard of York University, who has worked on the project with his colleague John Szymanski, said the idea came from finding two CDs of the same material, one with the top line sung by girls and the other by boys, in Wells cathedral's shop. A series of 20-second snippets was played to 190 listeners, aged between six and 70, who were asked if boys or girls were on top. Professor Howard said: \"62% identified the gender correctly. The results showed that adults did better than children, that girls did better than boys and that everyone could identify boys more regularly than girls.\" Most of those questioned liked what they heard which led Prof Howard to conclude that much of the controversy over girls in choirs was based on factors other than the quality of the sound they made. The research findings indicate that opposition to girls' voices is based not so much on aesthetics as on a deep-rooted conservatism about the role of women in church. Prof Howard's paper is one of more than 250 to be given at the sixth international conference on music perception and cognition at Keele University, one of Britain's principal centres for the study of music and psychology. One paper claims there is a scientific base to the \"Mozart effect\", whose supporters suggest that 10 minutes of a Mozart sonata is better preparation for certain kinds of tests than relaxation instructions or silence. This may complement other research from Poland which found that background music may impede concentration, findings which could lead to concerned parents confiscating the hi-fis of children who claim they cannot do their homework without a rock serenade.",

      "body": "<p>Newspaper editors begin careers covering golden weddings on local rags, chief police constables were once bobbies on the beat; for the BBC's head of corporate marketing, Jane Frost, it was trying to sell pink Shield toilet soap to an unconvinced public.</p> <p>Ms Frost joined Lever Brothers from Cambridge University in 1978 as a trainee brand manager. \"The chairman's wife thought pink was a rather nice colour, but the public didn't. We ended up sending 50 tons of the stuff to Africa, even though it was perfectly good soap.\"</p> <p>Not that Ms Frost thinks that the lessons she learnt at Lever were wasted. \"You don't get a better training in marketing than working at Lever. Look at Persil; it's been around 75 years and its brand is as strong as ever.\"</p> <p>Now she's in charge of exploiting all the potential that is locked up in the BBC brand - which ranks alongside Coca-Cola and Nike as one of the most instantly recognised brands in every corner of the globe. But the switch from selling soap to selling BBC soaps only came after a long slog up the corporate brands ladder, taking in dishwasher liquid and Shell lubricants.</p> <p>She switched to Shell, becoming head of marketing in the Middle East, in 1985 when her husband accepted a job in Dubai. At first things were tough. \"I ran into persistent sexism wherever I went, even within Shell, which at that time refused to give married women the same entitlement to allowances as married men.\"</p> <p>But she persevered and eventually won promotion to planning and marketing director for Shell across the whole of the Far East and Australasia. \"Marketing is 90% common sense. The basic principles apply the same way in Saudi as in Sainsbury's,\" she says.</p> <p>It was in the Middle East that she first tuned into the possibilities offered by the BBC. \"All the decision makers listened to it. In marketing terms it meant that you couldn't sell US jelly [jam in British english] because they wanted marmalade instead. If you could have advertised on the BBC it would be worth a fortune.\"</p> <p>Should we be worried that Ms Frost's job now is some sort of Birt-inspired plan to bring advertising to the BBC? True, she was headhunted in 1995 during the Birt era to bring Persil-style marketing disciplines to the BBC, and she reports directly to the Director General. But her chief task is to explain what the BBC is about - and help justify why we fork out \u00a3104 a year for a TV licence.</p> <p>Perfect Day - the promotional video aimed at telling viewers what the BBC is about - was her big break. \"We wanted to say that the BBC was a unique organisation. That if it disappeared, you'd really be losing something, and it deserves your support. It was about showing that the BBC can put together these stars, with this sort of quality, that it can surprise people and do something they really enjoy.\"</p> <p>The project was not without risks. \"Nobody had ever asked for a four-minute long promo to run across the BBC,\" she says.

      "bodyText": "Newspaper editors begin careers covering golden weddings on local rags, chief police constables were once bobbies on the beat; for the BBC's head of corporate marketing, Jane Frost, it was trying to sell pink Shield toilet soap to an unconvinced public. Ms Frost joined Lever Brothers from Cambridge University in 1978 as a trainee brand manager. \"The chairman's wife thought pink was a rather nice colour, but the public didn't. We ended up sending 50 tons of the stuff to Africa, even though it was perfectly good soap.\" Not that Ms Frost thinks that the lessons she learnt at Lever were wasted. \"You don't get a better training in marketing than working at Lever. Look at Persil; it's been around 75 years and its brand is as strong as ever.\" Now she's in charge of exploiting all the potential that is locked up in the BBC brand - which ranks alongside Coca-Cola and Nike as one of the most instantly recognised brands in every corner of the globe. But the switch from selling soap to selling BBC soaps only came after a long slog up the corporate brands ladder, taking in dishwasher liquid and Shell lubricants. She switched to Shell, becoming head of marketing in the Middle East, in 1985 when her husband accepted a job in Dubai. At first things were tough. \"I ran into persistent sexism wherever I went, even within Shell, which at that time refused to give married women the same entitlement to allowances as married men.\" But she persevered and eventually won promotion to planning and marketing director for Shell across the whole of the Far East and Australasia. \"Marketing is 90% common sense. The basic principles apply the same way in Saudi as in Sainsbury's,\" she says. It was in the Middle East that she first tuned into the possibilities offered by the BBC. \"All the decision makers listened to it. In marketing terms it meant that you couldn't sell US jelly [jam in British english] because they wanted marmalade instead. If you could have advertised on the BBC it would be worth a fortune.\" Should we be worried that Ms Frost's job now is some sort of Birt-inspired plan to bring advertising to the BBC? True, she was headhunted in 1995 during the Birt era to bring Persil-style marketing disciplines to the BBC, and she reports directly to the Director General. But her chief task is to explain what the BBC is about - and help justify why we fork out \u00a3104 a year for a TV licence. Perfect Day - the promotional video aimed at telling viewers what the BBC is about - was her big break. \"We wanted to say that the BBC was a unique organisation. That if it disappeared, you'd really be losing something, and it deserves your support. It was about showing that the BBC can put together these stars, with this sort of quality, that it can surprise people and do something they really enjoy.\" The project was not without risks. \"Nobody had ever asked for a four-minute long promo to run across the BBC,\" she says. But David Bowie, Elton John and Lou Reed were among the stars who gave their time to the project for a payment of just \u00a3250, and in December 1997 it shot to the top of the charts, selling more than 2m copies and raising \u00a32.5m for the Children in Need charity. \"Once we saw it, we all had faith in it and knew it was going to work. It became the anthem of the BBC. It was also wonderful to see other TV channels such as MTV having to carry our promotional video for free,\" she says. Its success led to the BBC picking up the Superbrand of the Year award in 1998, but Ms Frost admits that the lack of competition from ITV helped. \"It was good when ITV was still a very fragmented business; Granada is a bigger brand than ITV. But ITV is now getting smarter and picking up on our tricks.\" Ms Frost's latest task is to market to other broadcasting companies the services of what was once called BBC Resources but which has been hived off and relaunched as BBC Technology Ltd. \"I know the BBC is not thought of as a technology company, but just think, for example, how we put together the Millennium night broadcast. That involved broadcasting from 60 countries. The private sector makes huge promises about what it can deliver, but often fails. What the BBC has is proven expertise.

      "body": "<p>One of the great managers of Liverpool football club, Bill Shankly, is reported to have said : \"Football isn't a matter of life and death. It's far more important than that.\" Similarly, it seems, with chess. Long before the tantrums of modern chess players hit the headlines the game aroused strong passions.</p> <p>Luke Honey, chess specialist at London auction house Phillips, likes to relate the story of the Kempleten automaton. Ostensibly a robot, it was the creation of Wolfgang Von Kempleten, an Austrian mechanic and inventor. He toured the royal courts of Europe in the late 18th century with his creation, which was also known as \"the Turk\". The machine played against Catherine the Great in Russia and Napoleon was said to have been reduced to fury when the robot beat him not once but three times.</p> <p>The automaton, however, turned out to be a fake. There was a dwarf inside. The device was sold to an American collector and disappeared in a museum fire in 1926.</p> <p>Chess is a game of great antiquity. It is thought to have started in the 6th century in India, although its origin has also been ascribed to Persia, Russia and China.</p> <p>From earliest times the sets were a representation of war, devised by a king and his advisers and waged by pawns, the infantry. There have been a great variety of characters and characterisations. Napoleon and his marshals were models for sets, with Napoleon as king, Marshalls Ney and Massena as bishops and the Duke of Wellington the opposing king.</p> <p>In India sets were made for export from the 18th century onwards. Craftsmen from places like Madras and Jaipur carved and painted ivory and horn figures depicting Indian princes and their forces ranged against East India Company sepoys. These became known as John Company sets.</p> <p>Chess sets have been made of wood, ivory, pewter, precious metals like gold and silver, porcelain, including sets from Meissen, Doulton and Wedgwood; ebony, amber, ivory, bone, glass and even marble. Chess was always played on a board divided into squares, but by the end of the 15th century the board had become chequered, making play easier.</p> <p>However, the bewildering array of materials and characters, together with constant rule changes, meant that by the middle of the 19th century it had become such a complex game that even the best players had trouble identifying the pieces. It was only in the 1840s that an English master, Howard Staunton, produced a design for the standard set we know today. These were usually made by the manufacturer John Jacques and became known as Jacques Staunton's.</p> <p>Chess sets and literature are on sale everywhere, but well-known collections come up at auction only ocasionally. On Monday September 20 Christie's South Kensington is selling the Allen Hofrichter collection. Hofrichter, born in Austria, went to New York as a child. He opened a printing press in 1928 and during the 50s, and having established himself as an successful and innovative publisher, began seriously collecting chess sets as well as paintings and sculpture. The auction features 150 of his sets.</p> <p>One of the characteristics of chess auctions is that there are very few dealers. They attract mainly collectors and enthusiasts. Nick McElhatton, specialist at Christie's, says: \"There are a lot of chess collectors. It is a good field because the entry price is low - a few hundred pounds - and you can go as high as you like. This collection was put together between 1950 and 1970 so it is 30 years old. There will be interest in what was popular then.\"</p> <p>The most expensive chess sets are 17th century German ones from Augsburg, made of amber with semi-precious stones. These rarely come on the market but can realise more than \u00a3100,000. None appear in this auction, but there are some interesting Indian items.</p> <p>An Indian ivory John Company chess set dating from the early 19th century, featuring the British and Indian armies, is estimated to fetch \u00a38,000 to \u00a312,000. A Madras polychrome ivory set circa 1810, depicting warring Indian armies, could fetch up to \u00a35,000. From the 20th century, a Royal Doulton pottery set featuring mice is estimated at \u00a34,000 to \u00a36,000.</p> <p>These estimates, assuming they are met, would not show any great increase compared to, say, five years ago. But there has been great demand for Staunton's. Luke Honey at Phillips says that the bottom end of the market you would have paid \u00a3150 for a 19th century boxwood and ebony playing set. Last year they cost around \u00a3300. At Christie's a mahogany set is on offer at \u00a3800 to \u00a31,200.</p> <p>Staunton's can go up to \u00a310,000 if made of ivory. But according to Mr Honey, demand for Staunton's has fallen off a little in the past year. \"It is a market like everything else, and the great enthusiasm seems to have cooled a bit,\" he observes.</p> <p>\u0095 For further information telephone Christie's: 020-7581-7611; Phillips: 020-7629-6602.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the great managers of Liverpool football club, Bill Shankly, is reported to have said : \"Football isn't a matter of life and death. It's far more important than that.\" Similarly, it seems, with chess. Long before the tantrums of modern chess players hit the headlines the game aroused strong passions. Luke Honey, chess specialist at London auction house Phillips, likes to relate the story of the Kempleten automaton. Ostensibly a robot, it was the creation of Wolfgang Von Kempleten, an Austrian mechanic and inventor. He toured the royal courts of Europe in the late 18th century with his creation, which was also known as \"the Turk\". The machine played against Catherine the Great in Russia and Napoleon was said to have been reduced to fury when the robot beat him not once but three times. The automaton, however, turned out to be a fake. There was a dwarf inside. The device was sold to an American collector and disappeared in a museum fire in 1926. Chess is a game of great antiquity. It is thought to have started in the 6th century in India, although its origin has also been ascribed to Persia, Russia and China. From earliest times the sets were a representation of war, devised by a king and his advisers and waged by pawns, the infantry. There have been a great variety of characters and characterisations. Napoleon and his marshals were models for sets, with Napoleon as king, Marshalls Ney and Massena as bishops and the Duke of Wellington the opposing king. In India sets were made for export from the 18th century onwards. Craftsmen from places like Madras and Jaipur carved and painted ivory and horn figures depicting Indian princes and their forces ranged against East India Company sepoys. These became known as John Company sets. Chess sets have been made of wood, ivory, pewter, precious metals like gold and silver, porcelain, including sets from Meissen, Doulton and Wedgwood; ebony, amber, ivory, bone, glass and even marble. Chess was always played on a board divided into squares, but by the end of the 15th century the board had become chequered, making play easier. However, the bewildering array of materials and characters, together with constant rule changes, meant that by the middle of the 19th century it had become such a complex game that even the best players had trouble identifying the pieces. It was only in the 1840s that an English master, Howard Staunton, produced a design for the standard set we know today. These were usually made by the manufacturer John Jacques and became known as Jacques Staunton's. Chess sets and literature are on sale everywhere, but well-known collections come up at auction only ocasionally. On Monday September 20 Christie's South Kensington is selling the Allen Hofrichter collection. Hofrichter, born in Austria, went to New York as a child. He opened a printing press in 1928 and during the 50s, and having established himself as an successful and innovative publisher, began seriously collecting chess sets as well as paintings and sculpture. The auction features 150 of his sets. One of the characteristics of chess auctions is that there are very few dealers. They attract mainly collectors and enthusiasts. Nick McElhatton, specialist at Christie's, says: \"There are a lot of chess collectors. It is a good field because the entry price is low - a few hundred pounds - and you can go as high as you like. This collection was put together between 1950 and 1970 so it is 30 years old. There will be interest in what was popular then.\" The most expensive chess sets are 17th century German ones from Augsburg, made of amber with semi-precious stones. These rarely come on the market but can realise more than \u00a3100,000. None appear in this auction, but there are some interesting Indian items. An Indian ivory John Company chess set dating from the early 19th century, featuring the British and Indian armies, is estimated to fetch \u00a38,000 to \u00a312,000. A Madras polychrome ivory set circa 1810, depicting warring Indian armies, could fetch up to \u00a35,000. From the 20th century, a Royal Doulton pottery set featuring mice is estimated at \u00a34,000 to \u00a36,000. These estimates, assuming they are met, would not show any great increase compared to, say, five years ago. But there has been great demand for Staunton's. Luke Honey at Phillips says that the bottom end of the market you would have paid \u00a3150 for a 19th century boxwood and ebony playing set. Last year they cost around \u00a3300. At Christie's a mahogany set is on offer at \u00a3800 to \u00a31,200. Staunton's can go up to \u00a310,000 if made of ivory. But according to Mr Honey, demand for Staunton's has fallen off a little in the past year. \"It is a market like everything else, and the great enthusiasm seems to have cooled a bit,\" he observes. \u0095 For further information telephone Christie's: 020-7581-7611; Phillips: 020-7629-6602.",

It was rumoured that, at 60, he was tired, mildly depressed and generally fed up with his fugitive existence.</p> <p>After almost 15 years of hiding in the impenetrable Satyamangalam forest, where he presides over a vast sandalwood and ivory smuggling empire, he is keen to cut a deal with the authorities, sources suggest.</p> <p>On Wednesday a Tamil magazine editor set off into the jungle as an official emissary to ascertain the outlaw's demands. RR Gopal and three colleagues who accompanied him have been hampered by torrential rain and have yet to re-emerge.</p> <p>Mr Gopal has met Veerappan twice in the past to secure the release of kidnap victims. Before he left on Wednesday he described how, on his last encounter with Veerappan in 1997, he was led by one of his henchmen through a series of checkpoints before reaching \"a high point, with a drop of dizzying proportions\".</p> <p>\"Suddenly a person materialised with a levelled rifle... and the person who was accompanying me had to yell, saying not to shoot. Anyway, he then lowered his gun and led me to his chief.\"</p> <p>Veerappan was \"shrewd and intelligent\", he recalled. He was also said to be a master of junglecraft who could tell when a bird was flying out of fear.</p> <p>The camp was tidy and well-appointed. Mr Gopal said he was astonished when, on his arrival, the bandit presented him with a clean toothbrush and toothpaste. He was given food supplied by sympathetic villagers.</p> <p>Every morning Veerappan would ceremonially bless his weapons. He listened without fail to the BBC Tamil news, Mr Gopal said.</p> <p>On Monday, in an attempt to smooth future negotiations, government officials called off 500 policeman who had begun a half-hearted search of the 2,300 square miles of mountainous forest where Veerappan and his followers live.</p> <p>Over the last 10 years the army has tried several times to flush him out, but the bandit has stayed one step ahead.</p> <p>Rajkumar's abduction has convulsed India for the past week and provoked rioting in the actor's native Karnataka. Tamil newspaper offices have been pelted with stones, schools closed and bus services suspended. At least one fan has committed suicide. With 210 films to his credit, Rajkumar is revered more as an icon in his home state than as a mere celebrity.</p> <p>His kidnapping is the audacious climax to Veerappan's delinquent career, which began as a teenager when he shot his first elephant. He later set up his own poaching gang, killing more than 3,000 tuskers, and branched out into sandalwood smuggling.</p> <p>At first villagers regarded him as a heroic figure, but that reputation faded as the number of his victims grew. He was last arrested in 1986, only to escape, killing four policeman and a forest official as they slept.</p> <p>Three years ago he tried to secure an amnesty from the government, agreeing to give himself up in return for a maximum two-year jail sentence. But the deal fell through and Veerappan disappeared.</p> <p>As part of the failed agreement he stipulated that a film should be made of his life. In fact a Hindi movie, Jungle, which is loosely based on his exploits, is currently playing to packed cinema houses across India.</p> <p>Last night an Indian cameraman, Richard Mohan, who went to interview Veerappan in 1998 and was held captive for three days, said the biggest danger to Rajkumar's life was from the jungle terrain and climate.</p> <p>He recalled how Veerappan's party would sleep through the day and walk three to six miles in the night.</p> <p>\"Even for a youngster like me it was a killing experience.

Three male relatives were also seized. Until then Veerappan had been lying low. It was rumoured that, at 60, he was tired, mildly depressed and generally fed up with his fugitive existence. After almost 15 years of hiding in the impenetrable Satyamangalam forest, where he presides over a vast sandalwood and ivory smuggling empire, he is keen to cut a deal with the authorities, sources suggest. On Wednesday a Tamil magazine editor set off into the jungle as an official emissary to ascertain the outlaw's demands. RR Gopal and three colleagues who accompanied him have been hampered by torrential rain and have yet to re-emerge. Mr Gopal has met Veerappan twice in the past to secure the release of kidnap victims. Before he left on Wednesday he described how, on his last encounter with Veerappan in 1997, he was led by one of his henchmen through a series of checkpoints before reaching \"a high point, with a drop of dizzying proportions\". \"Suddenly a person materialised with a levelled rifle... and the person who was accompanying me had to yell, saying not to shoot. Anyway, he then lowered his gun and led me to his chief.\" Veerappan was \"shrewd and intelligent\", he recalled. He was also said to be a master of junglecraft who could tell when a bird was flying out of fear. The camp was tidy and well-appointed. Mr Gopal said he was astonished when, on his arrival, the bandit presented him with a clean toothbrush and toothpaste. He was given food supplied by sympathetic villagers. Every morning Veerappan would ceremonially bless his weapons. He listened without fail to the BBC Tamil news, Mr Gopal said. On Monday, in an attempt to smooth future negotiations, government officials called off 500 policeman who had begun a half-hearted search of the 2,300 square miles of mountainous forest where Veerappan and his followers live. Over the last 10 years the army has tried several times to flush him out, but the bandit has stayed one step ahead. Rajkumar's abduction has convulsed India for the past week and provoked rioting in the actor's native Karnataka. Tamil newspaper offices have been pelted with stones, schools closed and bus services suspended. At least one fan has committed suicide. With 210 films to his credit, Rajkumar is revered more as an icon in his home state than as a mere celebrity. His kidnapping is the audacious climax to Veerappan's delinquent career, which began as a teenager when he shot his first elephant. He later set up his own poaching gang, killing more than 3,000 tuskers, and branched out into sandalwood smuggling. At first villagers regarded him as a heroic figure, but that reputation faded as the number of his victims grew. He was last arrested in 1986, only to escape, killing four policeman and a forest official as they slept. Three years ago he tried to secure an amnesty from the government, agreeing to give himself up in return for a maximum two-year jail sentence. But the deal fell through and Veerappan disappeared. As part of the failed agreement he stipulated that a film should be made of his life. In fact a Hindi movie, Jungle, which is loosely based on his exploits, is currently playing to packed cinema houses across India. Last night an Indian cameraman, Richard Mohan, who went to interview Veerappan in 1998 and was held captive for three days, said the biggest danger to Rajkumar's life was from the jungle terrain and climate. He recalled how Veerappan's party would sleep through the day and walk three to six miles in the night. \"Even for a youngster like me it was a killing experience. I wonder how Rajkumar, who is 72, will be able to cope.\" From poaching to mass murder 1955 Teenage Veerappan shoots dead his first elephant and becomes the protege of infamous southern Indian poacher Xavier Gounder 1955-80 Kills 3,000 elephants and breaks away from his mentor 1983-85 Murders three forest guards from the state of Karnataka 1990 Military task force set up to end his reign of terror. The operation fails 1991 Karnataka deputy conservator of forest beheaded by his gang 1993 Kills 15 police informers and seven Tamil Nadu security officials 1994 Kidnaps senior police inspector and six others. Veerappan's brother Arjunan arrested. Inspector escapes. Arjunan dies in custody 1997 Kidnaps 10 Karnataka forest officials who are released after 44 days following the mediation of Tamil magazine editor RR Gopal 2000 Abducts Rajkumar, one of Indian cinema's most venerable stars, and three male relatives, from the actor's farmhouse How it all adds up All in all Veerappan has: \u0095 Killed 138 people, including 32 police officers and 10 forest officials \u0095Slaughtered more than 3,000 elephants \u0095Smuggled 40,000 kgs (88,000lbs) of ivory and looted sandalwood worth \u00a315m",

      "body": "<p>The self-proclaimed big bank for the big world started life small in the east of England in the early 1700s. What powered its rise in the next 300 years were the Quakers. But it was only for alphabetical reasons that the bank, which this week reported a near doubling of its half-year profits to \u00a31.8bn, became known as Barclays. </p> <p>Legend has it that the name was chosen because two directors with the name Barclay sat on the board and alphabetically came before Bassetts, the next in line. Well into the 1970s the bank was still managed by relatives of the founding Quaker families - the Barclay, Bevan, Birkbeck, Gurney, Pease, Tritton and Tuke, many of whose names were known in their own right for their financial prowess. </p> <p>Most of the family ties have now been lost - largely because the bank started to bring in outsiders to help it out of a string of sticky patches - although, by coincidence, John Varley, who runs the bank's retail banking operations, is married to a member of the founding Pease family. </p> <p>It has just pulled through its latest period of management uncertainly after spending much of last year without a chief executive when Martin Taylor, an outsider who was not a banker either, departed suddenly after a boardroom row. In what became a comedy of errors, his replacement, former US marine Michael O'Neill, failed to turn up for work on health grounds. </p> <p>Eventually, Irish Canadian Matt Barrett took the helm in October, just as the bank began to lurch from one controversy to another. </p> <p>First the bank caused outcry about plans, now dropped, to charge rivals' customers \u00a31 to withdraw money from hole-in-the-wall machines. Then the bank closed 171 branches, at the same time embarking on an advertising campaign proclaiming its size. Actor Sir Anthony Hopkins was dragged in to the ensuing row when it emerged the Welsh-born star featured on television screens at a time when the branch in his home area was on the closure list. </p> <p><strong> Damage limitation</strong><br> </p> <p> Then it emerged that Mr Barrett, the big bank's new chief executive, had a big pay deal too - worth 30 times his \u00a3850,000 basic salary. This week, just days before revealing its stunning profits rise, the bank suffered a glitch on its on-line bank - where it also proclaims to be the biggest - when a handful of customers were able to access other people's accounts. </p> <p>But, while a series of public relations disasters could be expected to inflict damage on a brand, in its half-yearly profits figures the bank claimed evidence to the contrary.

      "bodyText": "The self-proclaimed big bank for the big world started life small in the east of England in the early 1700s. What powered its rise in the next 300 years were the Quakers. But it was only for alphabetical reasons that the bank, which this week reported a near doubling of its half-year profits to \u00a31.8bn, became known as Barclays. Legend has it that the name was chosen because two directors with the name Barclay sat on the board and alphabetically came before Bassetts, the next in line. Well into the 1970s the bank was still managed by relatives of the founding Quaker families - the Barclay, Bevan, Birkbeck, Gurney, Pease, Tritton and Tuke, many of whose names were known in their own right for their financial prowess. Most of the family ties have now been lost - largely because the bank started to bring in outsiders to help it out of a string of sticky patches - although, by coincidence, John Varley, who runs the bank's retail banking operations, is married to a member of the founding Pease family. It has just pulled through its latest period of management uncertainly after spending much of last year without a chief executive when Martin Taylor, an outsider who was not a banker either, departed suddenly after a boardroom row. In what became a comedy of errors, his replacement, former US marine Michael O'Neill, failed to turn up for work on health grounds. Eventually, Irish Canadian Matt Barrett took the helm in October, just as the bank began to lurch from one controversy to another. First the bank caused outcry about plans, now dropped, to charge rivals' customers \u00a31 to withdraw money from hole-in-the-wall machines. Then the bank closed 171 branches, at the same time embarking on an advertising campaign proclaiming its size. Actor Sir Anthony Hopkins was dragged in to the ensuing row when it emerged the Welsh-born star featured on television screens at a time when the branch in his home area was on the closure list. Damage limitation Then it emerged that Mr Barrett, the big bank's new chief executive, had a big pay deal too - worth 30 times his \u00a3850,000 basic salary. This week, just days before revealing its stunning profits rise, the bank suffered a glitch on its on-line bank - where it also proclaims to be the biggest - when a handful of customers were able to access other people's accounts. But, while a series of public relations disasters could be expected to inflict damage on a brand, in its half-yearly profits figures the bank claimed evidence to the contrary. Instead of mass defections by customers, the bank insisted it was selling more products to its existing customers as well as pulling in new ones off the street. The spread eagle logo, softened last year to try to lose its brutal image, is still doing the trick, so the bank said. The motif itself, like the name of the bank itself, was an accident. Its association with Barclays can be traced back to 1728 when John Freame - his son-in-law was John Barclay - moved to a new premises in London's Lombard Street above which hung a huge black eagle sign. These were the days when few people could read or write so pictorial images, like the eagle, were important to attract customers. Even as Mr Freame and his son-in-law's business flourished - his name was added to the partnership in the 1730s - and they moved to various premises on Lombard Street above which pictorial images such as a bible and three crowns hung, it was the spread eagle which became synonymous with the bank. The three crowns were added to the logo 200 years later, though, when the bank wanted to register an emblem for Barclays, which took its name in 1896 when 20 private banks merged. It was known as the Quaker Bank though the early part of the 20th century because of its founders' roots. The three largest banks out of the 20 which formed Barclays were the long-winded Barclay, Bevan, Tritton, Ransom, Bouverle and Company of London; the Norwich and East Anglian-based Gurney group of banks; and the Jonathan Backhouse and Company of Darlington.

Then in 1969, it bought Martins, the last of the main banks not to be headquartered in London, which bulked up its size even further. Out of Africa Not content with expansion at home, the bank roved overseas in the 1920s and struck strong roots in Africa, which later left the bank saddled with criticism in the 1980s and reviled by student activists. Barclays also had ill-fated plans to be a major investment bank, embarrassingly bungling the development of BZW, which was disbanded three years ago and is now known as Barclays Capital.

      "bodyText": "Vodafone, the world's biggest mobile phone company, yesterday led the bidding in Germany's auction of third-generation mobile phone licences as it jostled with other operators to stitch up a network of such deals across Europe. Vodafone is competing with other telecoms groups such as Deutsche Telekom and Hutchison Whampoa to become the major player in 3G mobile on the continent. Each European country is selling capacity via beauty contests or auctions that will allow mobile phone operators to offer 3G technology. However, there was speculation yesterday that Deutsche Telekom's strategy to gain a foothold in the lucrative Italian market, which has 35m mobile users, may have been dealt a blow. Sources said Italian telecom's group Tiscali was likely to choose Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa as its preferred international partner in a consortium to bid for licences rather than Deutsche Telekom. Italy is expected to begin its auction of third-generation spectrum from August 24 and France, Switzerland and Belgium are expected to follow. The bidding in the German auction passed $4.5bn (\u00a33bn) yesterday. The auction surpassed the total $2.42bn raised in the Dutch auction last month but is still substantially short of the \u00a322.5bn raised by Britain's 3G licence sale in April.",

Discounts on domain names Magic Moments Internet yesterday announced a low cost domain name registration facility service, called 123-reg.co.uk, which allows customers to order and manage their own domain name and email services online. The service has been developed by WebFusion, the company that Magic Moments acquired in May, and is aimed at customers with a requirement to register many names as part of their business. Guinness goes to strike ballot The union representing workers at Guinness Ireland said yesterday it would press ahead with a strike ballot after talks to prevent 300 job losses ended without success. The Services Industrial Professional Technical Union had urged Guinness, owned by Britain's Diageo, to suspend the decision to cut jobs at two plants in the town of Dundalk. The vote takes place on Tuesday but no strike date has been set. Coca Cola protests A group of former and current black Coca-Cola workers said yesterday they would disrupt the drinks company's tentative settlement of a racial discrimination lawsuit if details of the deal were not revealed soon. The workers stood outside the company's headquarters in Atlanta and protested that terms of the settlement had remained secret. Two months ago, Coca-Cola tentatively settled the 1999 suit that accused it of discriminating against blacks in pay, promotions and performance reviews. An American court has, however, ordered that details of the deal remain sealed until October. EU looks at post proposals The European Commission has invited comments under its merger regulations on new joint ventures involving Britain's Post Office, TNT Post Group and Singapore Post Private.",

      "bodyText": "A chief constable is to be investigated over allegations that he deliberately leaked details of a scathing government adviser's report on one of his own high profile detectives. Barry Shaw of Cleveland police was named by a staff whistleblower who claims that contemptuous criticism of Ray Mallon's \"zero tolerance\" policing scheme was given to the press. The allegations, made under the protection of the new Public Interest Disclosure Act by a civilian employee of the force, say that the chief constable approved of the leak, in spite of his repeated position that background to the controversy over Mr Mallon must remain confidential for the police inquiry - named Operation Lancet - to be \"scrupulously fair\". Mr Shaw, who will continue his normal duties during the new inquiry, has strongly denied any connection with the leak, which effectively wrecked a media conference by Mr Mallon in June, shortly after he was cleared of criminal behaviour over the use of police informants when a superintendent in Middlesbrough. The new inquiry will see the third independent senior officer in as many years investigate Cleveland police force. The Daily Express published long extracts from a dossier by Treasury counsel - QCs who advise the government on the likelihood of successful prosecutions - which condemned Mr Mallon's administration as \"woeful and chaotic\" and described his version of the American zero tolerance policy as showing \"complete indifference\" to the law. The decision to investigate the claims was made by an emergency meeting of Cleveland police authority, which has asked South Yorkshire chief constable Michael Hedges to lead the inquiry. The authority rejected calls for the suspension of Mr Shaw, which would only be within its powers if leaving him in post would inhibit the investigation or was otherwise in the public interest. The inquiry, Operation Lancet, was initially launched in 1997 by the then chief constable of Warwickshire, Andrew Timson, who resigned two years later when he was faced with unrelated allegations against him from within his own force. He was succeeded in 1999 by Lloyd Clarke, deputy chief constable of West Yorkshire, who wrapped up the main inquiry last autumn. The background to Operation Lancet goes back much further, however, to the collapse of a drugs trial on Teesside, which left a legacy of suspicion about the way informers were handled in parts of the Cleveland service. Mr Shaw, who is 59 and a former Merchant Navy officer and Glasgow beat constable, told the Guardian last month that he believed there were officers in Cleveland who should be in jail and others who should be dismissed. He said then: \"If I can't sleep easily at night over probity in my force, no one in Cleveland can.\" Mr Mallon, who is 45 and was courted by Labour and Conservative politicians during the last general election campaign as a figurehead of tough policing, has called for a public inquiry into the Lancet affair. He denounced \"dirty tricks\" after the leak in June and has demanded repeatedly that he should be reinstated. He is still suspended pending disciplinary hearings over Lancet's central informant allegations, which could take at least another year. Mr Shaw said last night that the inquiry was welcome and would receive full co-operation. He said: \"It is a difficult time but the force should not be diverted from the excellent work officers and support staff are doing in tackling crime and anti-social behaviour on our streets.\"",

The discussions follow a review of naval bases across the UK which concluded that they were operating at almost 45% over capacity. Discussions are under way with Babcock Rosyth Defence, owners of Rosyth dockyard, about the handling of key services at the Faslane base, home to four Trident nuclear submarines. Talks are also taking place with Devonport Management in Plymouth and Fleet Support in Portsmouth. The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, said yesterday that the government could save up to \u00a3150m as a result of the discussions. \"We already have high level security work conducted by private companies and we have the very highest security and safety standards,\" Mr Hoon said. \"This is a very early stage in the process. These kinds of arrangements already exist in the shipyards and it is something we are looking to extend. There is significant overcapacity in warship repair and maintenance across the UK.\" Almost all the 8,000 workers at Faslane are employed by the MoD. Dennis Richmond, head of Babcock facilities management, said in a statement that operational ship and submarine work were included in their proposal. \"We envisage handling nuclear work such as checks, tests and maintenance of the submarines' reactor plant,\" he said. The company, which operates the Rosyth naval base in Fife, said a contract could be signed next year, with Babcock assuming control at Faslane by 2002. The MoD insists that there is no question of the armed guarding of the facility being handed over to the private sector. It says there is already private sector involvement in building and refitting the nuclear submarine fleet and that safety and security would always be paramount. But unions and opposition politicians expressed concerns about the implications of the move. Officials say up to 3,000 jobs could be at risk, 1,000 of them at Faslane, if the proposals go ahead. Alan Grey, convener for the Institute of Professionals, Managers and Specialists, said he would request a meeting with Mr Hoon to discuss why Babcock Rosyth Defence was given more information about the talks than workers at the base. \"This government came in saying they would not follow the previous administration's line of private good, public bad. In practice, they appear to have come with the belief that the public sector is a bad thing,\" he said. Jack Dromey, national organiser for the Transport and General Workers Union, said: \"Our message is do not rush to a private sector judgment, do not make the mistakes of the Tories. \"You cannot now say thanks for your past loyalty, flexibility, your reward is the sack for some and privatisation for others. Post Paddington, safety and security must come before the interests of private shareholders.\" The shadow defence secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the security implications of the possible privatisation. \"This decision may seriously affect our national security and our armed forces' technical security,\" he warned. Mr Duncan Smith said the decision was motivated by a desire to cut costs. He added: \"Yet again, this Labour government is putting cutting costs before the security of our armed forces.\" A Scottish National party spokesman said that it had huge concerns about \"plans to privatise Britain's nuclear weapons\". He said the SNP wanted to see nuclear weapons scrapped, not handed over to a private company devoted to putting profit before safety.",

Clark, the ringleader of the group, was sentenced to 12 years. Drury received 11 years. Evidence presented at the two trials showed the detectives were involved in lucrative double-dealing. Their corrupt activities were exposed when a drug dealer, Evelyn Fleckney, who was having an affair with Clark, turned supergrass, and another officer in the squad, Det Con Neil Putnam, gave evidence against his colleagues after \"wrestling with his conscience\", the court heard. Fleckney, a powerful drug baroness, described how she became a police informer in the early 1990s. She and Clark became lovers, staying in \u00a3200-a-night hotels - signing in under the name Bart Simpson - going on holidays to the Canary Islands and exchanging expensive gifts.

Kingston and O'Connell were among officers who went to the scene. They took two of the six packets they found and put them in a carrier bag. Putnam, who was there as an exhibits officer, was asked by Kingston to take the bag to Reynolds, who was off duty. \"Reynolds arranged for the drugs to be sold and a few weeks later gave Putnam \u00a3500, his share of the proceeds,\" said Mr Pownall. Sentencing Kingston and Reynolds yesterday, Judge David Paget QC said: \"You have been convicted of what is a very grave offence.\" Suspicions about the squad and rumours of the relationship between Fleckney and Clark persisted throughout the 1990s, but nothing could be proved. However, Fleckney turned supergrass after she was convicted in March 1998 of conspiracy to supply ecstasy, cocaine and cannabis and jailed for 15 years.

But physical punishment would remain forbidden in day nurseries, playgroups, children's centres and creches.</p> <p>Childminders said they did not want the right to smack, and condemned the government for putting children at risk of abuse.</p> <p>The National Childminding Association (NCMA), whose 40,000 members are against smacking said its telephone lines were jammed yesterday with parents and professionals complaining about the proposals.</p> <p>Gill Haynes, chief executive, said: \"We are appalled that the government has ignored our advice. These standards are supposed to be about providing safe quality care for children wherever they are, but smacking babies can never be acceptable in any childcare setting.</p> <p>\"A recent consultation document published by the Department of Health showed that most people believe children under two should never be smacked by parents, let alone by a professional childcare worker.</p> <p>\"Childminding is the most used form of day care for children. Why should it have different standards to other forms of care?\"</p> <p>Ms Haynes said the government had misunderstood the purpose of regulation, and the proposals contradicted national occupational standards.</p> <p>Childminders often cared for children from different families at the same time, she said, and even if a childminder did agree to physical punishment it would be difficult to enforce different rules for individual children.</p> <p>The regulations will standardise daycare for children and are expected to come into force next year. Currently each local authority has different standards.</p> <p>A department spokeswoman said childminders who worked in their own homes were different from carers in other settings.</p> <p>\"Rather than the government telling people what they can and cannot do in their own homes, these proposals mean that with the permission of parents childminders will be allowed to agree to smack children,\" she said.</p> <p>\"This is not the government encouraging childminders or parents to smack children; it is giving them a choice about how children are disciplined.\"</p> <p>Gaby Shenton, acting director of the child safety charity Kidscape, said: \"These proposals are an indictment of the government's attitude to children. Smacking is not acceptable.</p> <p>\"Children are the most vulnerable people in society, but they are not being protected by the government. We have a women's minister and a disability minister.

      "bodyText": "Childminders yesterday criticised a government proposal to allow them to smack children and babies in their care. New regulations on childcare planned by the Department for Education and Employment would allow childminders to smack children in their homes if parents gave permission. But physical punishment would remain forbidden in day nurseries, playgroups, children's centres and creches. Childminders said they did not want the right to smack, and condemned the government for putting children at risk of abuse. The National Childminding Association (NCMA), whose 40,000 members are against smacking said its telephone lines were jammed yesterday with parents and professionals complaining about the proposals. Gill Haynes, chief executive, said: \"We are appalled that the government has ignored our advice. These standards are supposed to be about providing safe quality care for children wherever they are, but smacking babies can never be acceptable in any childcare setting. \"A recent consultation document published by the Department of Health showed that most people believe children under two should never be smacked by parents, let alone by a professional childcare worker. \"Childminding is the most used form of day care for children. Why should it have different standards to other forms of care?\" Ms Haynes said the government had misunderstood the purpose of regulation, and the proposals contradicted national occupational standards. Childminders often cared for children from different families at the same time, she said, and even if a childminder did agree to physical punishment it would be difficult to enforce different rules for individual children. The regulations will standardise daycare for children and are expected to come into force next year. Currently each local authority has different standards. A department spokeswoman said childminders who worked in their own homes were different from carers in other settings. \"Rather than the government telling people what they can and cannot do in their own homes, these proposals mean that with the permission of parents childminders will be allowed to agree to smack children,\" she said. \"This is not the government encouraging childminders or parents to smack children; it is giving them a choice about how children are disciplined.\" Gaby Shenton, acting director of the child safety charity Kidscape, said: \"These proposals are an indictment of the government's attitude to children. Smacking is not acceptable. \"Children are the most vulnerable people in society, but they are not being protected by the government. We have a women's minister and a disability minister. But we do not have a children's minister when one is clearly needed.\" The proposals would also allow childminders to smoke in front of newborn babies with parents' consent, but would ban all other childcare professionals from doing so. The NCMA yesterday was planning to draw up a children's health charter in protest. The Foundation for Cot Death said the proposal would endanger babies, as smoking around them substantially increased the risk of cot death.

What began as flashing escalated into serious sexual abuse. Since he was 18 he has served three sentences for his assaults.</p> <p>These days, James has a job. He lives near London and has friends. He also has the odd minder. Because he is classed as a high risk, he is visited by officers from a police paedophile unit and is the subject of surveillance - sometimes covert, sometimes overt. He also has a very sceptical probation officer. Because he is classed as high risk he was interviewed by officers investigating the murder of Sarah Payne.</p> <p>James is talking the talk and walking the walk. The jargon of therapy sits well with him - he was a \"groomer\" and he \"owns\" his crimes. He has done a few treatment programmes and has achieved a superconfidence from the belief that he has made himself better. His eyes dart around nervously at first but as he recounts details of his crimes he pins your eyes down, watching for a twitch of disgust.</p> <p>Like most other sex offenders, James opened the last two editions of the News of the World with trepidation. Had he been named, he would almost certainly have lost his job. Speaking before the newspaper's announcement yesterday that it was suspending its campaign, he said he was prepared to \"give a kicking\" to anyone who \"grassed\" him and sent his name to the paper.</p> <p>Since the campaign began, agencies working with offenders have warned that vigilante attacks will lead to serious offenders going underground. Without controls and with an increase in stress, the paedophile is much more likely to reoffend. Some probation officers have reported that one or two of their supervisees have disappeared.</p> <p>James says the threat of exposure does not tempt him to go to ground but he did do so before: easily. When police were looking for him after his last offence he went to the Netherlands, where he used prison contacts and hooked up with a paedophile ring. He was caught and extradited and sentenced to eight years' imprisonment, of which he served five.</p> <p>James knows networks of paedophiles at home and abroad. He used to let them have videos of his offences. He maintains that it took him three years in prison before he stopped associating with them but he could get back in touch any time. James believes he knows the workings of their minds.</p> <p>Quite calmly, he says: \"The impact [of the outing campaign] is pretty simple, really. These guys will go on the run - they are not going to stand around waiting for a kicking or have their windows put in or firebombed. They will say to themselves, 'I am on the run now and I have a list of 20 to 30 paedophiles.' What's to stop them all getting together and all going underground or abroad?</p> <p>\"They are going to feel a lot safer than being alone. They will think, 'Well, we are wanted by society, our picture is going to be in the paper. OK, well I will go and snatch a kid off the street.' They are facing a life sentence anyway.\"</p> <p>James points out that most prolific sex offenders have a network they have built up of many hundreds of people, a network that can be relied on quickly: for disappearance or pleasure.</p> <p>\"I do know of a lot of paedophiles that aren't on the registers at the moment that have disappeared. I know two of the people who were outed last Sunday and they told me years ago that if they were ever outed they would disappear.</p> <p>\"The public wants to know that their children are safe but the way their children are going to be safe is to let the professionals deal with this situation. If they continue with this they are going to end up getting some kid killed.\"</p> <p><b> Clive</b><br></p> <p>Like James, Clive does not fit the stereotype of the paedophile. He is trendily dressed in jeans, sweatshirt, chunky shoes. He is clean and bright. Like James, he does not look how a paedophile is supposed to look.</p> <p>The panic over the murder of Sarah Payne has caused us to misuse labels, to forget that only a tiny proportion of the 110,000 men regarded as convicted sex offenders fall into the category of predatory paedophiles who abduct children. Most are minor offenders or, like Clive, have abused members of their own family. Clive, 42, was convicted of indecent assault against his girlfriend's little sister. During the course of the police investigation it emerged that he had also abused his own sisters, offences that began when he was nine. Clive was given a four and a half year sentence of which he served three years, and is now on licence until January 2002.</p> <p>Like James, Clive believes he has stopped offending. He went through the sex offenders' treatment programme in prison and claims that he now avoids stressful situations, which he has identified as leading to his previous pattern of offending. He says: \"I am absolutely certain that I won't reoffend. I am a different person from what I used to be. I read a lot of books on Buddhism, shamanism and philosophies and that helps me. I am more educated now and know what's wrong.\"</p> <p>Clive produces pages of A4 on which he has written lengthy notes about the News of the World campaign. He lists the effects of naming and shaming: \"shopping will be difficult\", and \"socialising will be virtually non-existent\". But, importantly, he says the campaign has increased stress levels, depression and fear and lowered self-esteem; all factors that can combine to trigger reoffending.</p> <p>Clive has met many paedophiles who are untouched by their offences and fears their reaction to outing. \"Most sex offenders will not endanger their own life,\" he says. \"The risk of reoffending increases if prison is the only alternative means of safety. If you have nowhere else to go and you know prison is the only place you can go, then you may as well reoffend.</p> <p>\"Those that have not been convicted or caught may use alternative, more severe means in gaining a victim so as not to get caught. The most severe means is obviously murder. There's very few sex offenders I would say that are high risk, but the ones that are high risk are capable.\"</p> <p>He believes disclosure only reinforces the idea that offenders can never be allowed to change, thus giving them a justification for their behaviour. He thinks children who threaten to expose known sex offenders may be at risk.</p> <p>Clive is, of course, also worried for himself. His girlfriend has not told her family about his past. \"She would have a lot to answer to,\" he says. \"She thinks that her brother will actually beat her up. She's certainly incredibly scared.</p> <p>\"I can understand people's point of view, why they don't want me to come out or mix with them. I think the way forward is to accept that I must have a second chance. If I fail again then fair enough, give me life.\"</p> <p><b> John</b><br></p> <p>Forty-nine-year-old John knows what it is like to be exposed. He has been beaten up on a number of occasions, verbally abused and taken for the serious sex offender that justice decided he was not.</p> <p>John is on two years' probation for indecent assault. He says that on two occasions he put his hand on a boy's bottom and on his back and he was eventually prosecuted for it. He denies any further assault but admits he is not sure what might have happened. The court considered it a minor offence but his local community did not.</p> <p>John fears wider exposure, not for himself but for his family. And he is also worried about the effect any disclosure would have on his victim. \"It wasn't a serious offence but it was still an offence and the victim needs protecting,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Given what happened I can understand people's anger but this isn't the answer.

This summer Mr Cohen and a handful of other Israeli designers have penetrated a cultural barrier, plundering the markets of East Jerusalem and towns under Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank for cloth, beads, and T-shirts emblazoned with Arab film stars and calligraphy. Their small, tentative and confused homage to indigenous culture is rare in Israel where \"Arab taste\" is generally considered a term of abuse. It signals increasing curiosity among Israelis towards their former enemies, the Palestinians, and greater cultural assertion by the Second Israel - the immigrants from Middle Eastern countries. In recent months, for example, there has been a small trickle of Jewish Israelis returning to West Bank towns to shop. To Mr Cohen, a French-trained designer who sells long dresses with Damascus silk panels in his shop on Shenken Street, the interest in traditional Arab textiles was as much about self-discovery as appreciation of the Palestinian other. Born in Haifa of Moroccan immigrants, Mr Cohen, 35, spent his childhood in an agony of embarrassment, compounded by his parents speaking Arabic at home and playing Arabic records. \"I wanted to be Israeli,\" he said. \"When I was 15 years old to be a Moroccan was not so good.\" But when he grew up he came back to his roots. \"Suddenly I felt something inside me wake up. Because inside, I am an Arab. I speak the language, and I grew up eating from an Arab kitchen.\" Recent students of the Shenkar College of Engineering and Design, Israel's top fashion training institute, have created Arabic-inspired collections and the college had its first Israeli Arab graduate this year. The current guide to Tel Aviv nightclubs is emblazoned with lines of Arabic type. But the cover designer admits that the writing, which makes no sense in translation, was chosen only for its graphic appeal. \"A day in pyjamas, a day in the kitchen,\" it reads. The Israeli designs have yet to penetrate the mainstream or win followers in Arab East Jerusalem or in areas ruled by the Palestinian Authority. There the younger generation dresses as it has for years: in jeans and T-shirts, or, for the more traditional women, headscarves and long tunics. And while Mr Cohen is expansive on his love of Arabic music, textiles and architecture, the appreciation does not extend towards a greater understanding of the Palestinians and their political aspirations. \"It is not Saddam Hussein I think about when I make a dress,\" he said. \"It is not because I like Arabs. I am doing it because I like the colours, and I like the wonderful Syrian brocades.\" But Hani Mourad, director of the Institute of Fashion and Textile Design near Bethlehem, the only such college in Palestinian-ruled areas, does not take offence at cultural borrowing. \"It may be 1,001 nights, but at least you really have to like something to copy it,\" he said. \"Politically, it is a nice statement that they are calling it Arabic. Maybe one day they will call it Palestinian.\" For veterans of the tiny Israeli fashion scene, the latest trend for Arab-influenced design is a tiny bubble waiting to be popped. They remember the 60s and 70s when loose-fitting kaftans made in Israel were snapped up by New York boutiques. Israeli designers plundered liberally in those days, scouring Arab markets for beads, cloth and keffiyehs, and employing Palestinian seamstresses expert in traditional embroidery, according to Tamara Yuval-Jones, a designer from that period who now teaches at the Shenkar college . But with modern Israel intent on modelling itself on western Europe and north America, the fashion designers turned west again in what Ms Yuval-Jones argued was partly the result of a lack of confidence in a new nation. \"Usually a provincial sign of taste is that they want what they see in Paris or Milan,\" she said. \"Most of the designers here want fabrics from Paris or Italy, and they are not interested in fabrics that they can find just around the corner.\" But the turbulent politics of the region also intervened to inhibit appreciation of indigenous culture. \"Unfortunately,\" she said, \"there is not a big love here between Jews and Arabs.\"",

      "body": "<p>Driving into Madrid from Barajas international airport, the Spanish capital is heralded by an extraordinary monument. In the summer heat haze it is hard, until you get close, to work out what exactly this Brobdingnagian structure is. One of Don Quixote's giants? An overgrown Spanish oak? A freak outcrop of vertiginous rock, its peak neon-lit by a cinematic billboard at night?</p> <p>As you inch nearer, you finally work it out. This is the Torres Blancas building, a huge organic-style apartment block, designed in 1961 and completed in 1968 by the architect Francisco Javier S\u00e1enz de Oiza, who has died of cancer, aged 81. With his Banco de Bilbao, it remains the most distinctive modern building in Madrid.</p> <p>S\u00e1enz de Oiza was one of a small number of energetic practitioners who reinvigorated Spanish architecture in the 1950s and 1960s, after the deep sleep of dull neo-classicism dutifully trotted out by architects after Franco's seizure of power in 1939. Along with Jos\u00e9 Coderch, Oriol Bohigas and Alejandro de la Sota, he brought, at first, a highly rational geometric modernism, and then an inconoclastic \"organicist\" architecture, into what had become the stale, dry mix of Francoist design.</p> <p>Architects, however, were far freer to express new ideas under the fascists than writers and film-makers. It is worth noting that, when S\u00e1enz de Oiza began work on the radical Torres Blancas in 1961, Luis Bu\u00f1uel's Viridiana, which had just won a prize in Venice, was banned by Franco's censors; the liberal newspaper, Madrid, was closed as he started on the design of the distinctive Banco de Bilbao (the BBV building today) 10 years later.</p> <p>Because architecture is not a literal art, its practioners have often been able to experiment under the nose of dictators, whose own taste has tended to be for a grandiose, yet formal, neo-classicism.</p> <p>The Torres Blancas building was, however, S\u00e1enz de Oiza's most extreme and expressive design. He was noted for his rational and sometimes monumental housing, beginning in Madrid at the end of the 1940s, and for his later attempt to reconcile the naturalness of Frank Lloyd Wright with the geometric logic and precision of Mies van der Rohe.</p> <p>This process began at the time of the last of the Congr\u00e8s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) meetings in the 1950s. Here, Team X, a group of young international architects that S\u00e1enz de Oiza associated with, won the day with a campaign for a more human, modern architecture than the clinical white approach that emerged in the 1920s with Le Corbusier and Mies.</p> <p>This approach can be seen in the Ciudad Blanca tourist housing of 1961-3, which S\u00e1enz de Oiza designed, on the coast at Alcudia, Majorca. Although quite severe looking, the white concrete apartments form a modern landscape that sets up a man-made dialogue with the seascape they intrude upon.</p> <p>The search for a balance between the natural and the man-made in architectural design was to lead S\u00e1enz de Oiza up several alleyways in his career, more or less successfully. He looked for inspiration, at various times and in various of his own projects, in the design and ideas not just of Wright and Mies, but also of the American-Finnish architect Eero Saarinen, the Finn Jorn Utzon and the Estonian-American Louis Kahn, all of whom designed highly expressive buildings that took modern architecture a long way from Le Corbusier's \"machines for living in\".</p> <p>Saarinen's most outlandish building was the TWA terminal, in the guise of birds' wings at John F Kennedy airport, New York; Utzon's was the unforgettable Sydney Opera House; and Kahn's, the Bangladeshi parliament building in Dacca. In fact, one of S\u00e1enz de Oiza's latest designs, the Torretriana regional government building in Seville (1989-97), is a homage to Kahn.</p> <p>Unsure perhaps of his identity as an architect, or perhaps just a modest man, S\u00e1enz de Oiza often said, \"I'm really a very bad architect.\" He was heard to say this during his brief acceptance speech when presented with the Prince of Asturias Prize in 1993, one of many awards that came his way during the last 20 years of his life. More likely, however, it was a case of S\u00e1enz de Oiza being continually dissatisfied with his work - it was harder for architects to find their feet as confidently in Franco's Spain as it was in democratic Europe and the United States.</p> <p>However, there was no lack of work.

      "bodyText": "Driving into Madrid from Barajas international airport, the Spanish capital is heralded by an extraordinary monument. In the summer heat haze it is hard, until you get close, to work out what exactly this Brobdingnagian structure is. One of Don Quixote's giants? An overgrown Spanish oak? A freak outcrop of vertiginous rock, its peak neon-lit by a cinematic billboard at night? As you inch nearer, you finally work it out. This is the Torres Blancas building, a huge organic-style apartment block, designed in 1961 and completed in 1968 by the architect Francisco Javier S\u00e1enz de Oiza, who has died of cancer, aged 81. With his Banco de Bilbao, it remains the most distinctive modern building in Madrid. S\u00e1enz de Oiza was one of a small number of energetic practitioners who reinvigorated Spanish architecture in the 1950s and 1960s, after the deep sleep of dull neo-classicism dutifully trotted out by architects after Franco's seizure of power in 1939. Along with Jos\u00e9 Coderch, Oriol Bohigas and Alejandro de la Sota, he brought, at first, a highly rational geometric modernism, and then an inconoclastic \"organicist\" architecture, into what had become the stale, dry mix of Francoist design. Architects, however, were far freer to express new ideas under the fascists than writers and film-makers. It is worth noting that, when S\u00e1enz de Oiza began work on the radical Torres Blancas in 1961, Luis Bu\u00f1uel's Viridiana, which had just won a prize in Venice, was banned by Franco's censors; the liberal newspaper, Madrid, was closed as he started on the design of the distinctive Banco de Bilbao (the BBV building today) 10 years later. Because architecture is not a literal art, its practioners have often been able to experiment under the nose of dictators, whose own taste has tended to be for a grandiose, yet formal, neo-classicism. The Torres Blancas building was, however, S\u00e1enz de Oiza's most extreme and expressive design. He was noted for his rational and sometimes monumental housing, beginning in Madrid at the end of the 1940s, and for his later attempt to reconcile the naturalness of Frank Lloyd Wright with the geometric logic and precision of Mies van der Rohe. This process began at the time of the last of the Congr\u00e8s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) meetings in the 1950s. Here, Team X, a group of young international architects that S\u00e1enz de Oiza associated with, won the day with a campaign for a more human, modern architecture than the clinical white approach that emerged in the 1920s with Le Corbusier and Mies. This approach can be seen in the Ciudad Blanca tourist housing of 1961-3, which S\u00e1enz de Oiza designed, on the coast at Alcudia, Majorca. Although quite severe looking, the white concrete apartments form a modern landscape that sets up a man-made dialogue with the seascape they intrude upon. The search for a balance between the natural and the man-made in architectural design was to lead S\u00e1enz de Oiza up several alleyways in his career, more or less successfully. He looked for inspiration, at various times and in various of his own projects, in the design and ideas not just of Wright and Mies, but also of the American-Finnish architect Eero Saarinen, the Finn Jorn Utzon and the Estonian-American Louis Kahn, all of whom designed highly expressive buildings that took modern architecture a long way from Le Corbusier's \"machines for living in\". Saarinen's most outlandish building was the TWA terminal, in the guise of birds' wings at John F Kennedy airport, New York; Utzon's was the unforgettable Sydney Opera House; and Kahn's, the Bangladeshi parliament building in Dacca. In fact, one of S\u00e1enz de Oiza's latest designs, the Torretriana regional government building in Seville (1989-97), is a homage to Kahn. Unsure perhaps of his identity as an architect, or perhaps just a modest man, S\u00e1enz de Oiza often said, \"I'm really a very bad architect.\" He was heard to say this during his brief acceptance speech when presented with the Prince of Asturias Prize in 1993, one of many awards that came his way during the last 20 years of his life. More likely, however, it was a case of S\u00e1enz de Oiza being continually dissatisfied with his work - it was harder for architects to find their feet as confidently in Franco's Spain as it was in democratic Europe and the United States. However, there was no lack of work. Franco's Spain was often quite successful from a strictly economic point of view. Between 1950 and 1970, the population of Madrid rose from about 2m to 4m people. New buildings were needed as never before. S\u00e1enz de Oiza was one of the architects who did well during this boom, and has left his mark on the city - with the Torres Blancas and the great rounded Banco de Bilbao Tower of 1971-81, on Paseo de la Castellana, Madrid's main thoroughfare. After Franco's death in 1975, public sector architecture throughout Spain enjoyed a boom as the regions regained increasing levels of autonomy and new administrative and civic buildings were needed or wanted. Born in Navarra, S\u00e1enz de Oiza trained in Madrid, and spent most of his career in the Castillian capital. In the early 1980s, he became director of the Madrid School of Architecture where, a lively and talkative man who could criticise without causing offence, he was popular with students. As part of the post-Franco establishment, he designed the Spanish embassy in Brussels, along with such other public monuments as the Public University of Navarra, Pamplona, and the delightful remodelling of an old palacio in Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, into the Atlantic Centre of Modern Art (1988-89). This showed in another guise how the architect was always trying to reconcile one architectural approach with another. Mostly he got it right, although there are some designs - such as the broad-shouldered social housing complex (1986-90) on the edge of Madrid's M-30 express ring road - that lack every last spore of the organic quality he sought, and expressed so dramatically in the Torres Blancas. Saenz de Oiza is survived by his wife and their seven children, four of them architects who frequently collaborated with their father.

      "bodyText": "The Zimbabwean government has begun its long-promised mass expropriation of white-owned land for redistribution to millions of black peasants with the seizure of the first farms without compensation. The confiscation of Viewfield Farm in Centenary, an hour's drive from Harare, comes after months of confrontation and violence as President Robert Mugabe vowed to take much of Zimbabwe's fertile land out of the hands of a few thousand white farmers. Although hundreds of farms have already been illegally occupied by war veterans and their supporters, and several white families forced to flee their homes, Viewfield is the first to be taken by the government after being legally designated for confiscation. An official messenger served the elderly owner, April Davies, with the papers authorising its seizure. She has 90 days to vacate her house. Her 34 black farm labourers and their families have also been ordered off the property. The government bussed 47 families, described by local officials as \"land starved\", to the 1,300-hectare (3,200-acre) tobacco and maize farm. They were allowed to peg out 28 hectares each. The government says another two dozen farms in the area will be resettled within days and it will use the army to move 500,000 families on to expropriated farms in the coming months. It described those given land on Viewfield Farm as widows, war veterans and villagers on communal land. Locals say the families were chosen for their loyalty to Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. The Mashonaland provincial governor, Elliot Manyika, who handed over the land, said: \"This is the start of an ongoing exercise to resettle the people before the onset of the rains. \"We want them to prepare the land and produce to feed the nation. Infrastructure will follow when we have finished putting the people on the land,\" he said to the cheers of the new owners. But by Mr Manyika's own admission, the 47 families have no tools or skill in using the farm's equipment, raising serious doubts that they will fulfil his exhortation. Critics warn that wholesale seizure of commercial farms will wreck Zimbabwe's agricultural production and an already battered economy. The finance minister, Simba Makoni, admits that the economy is in \"deep crisis\" and imposed a sharp devaluation and a block on new public spending in an attempt to revive it. The government is also scrambling to fend off looming American sanctions aimed at blocking all international finance and US aid to Zimbabwe because of the illegal land seizures and political violence. White farmers have taken the government to the supreme court, arguing that the land seizures amount to unconstitutional racial discrimination. In his court application, David Hasluck, the director of the Commercial Farmers Union, concedes that whites dominate land ownership but adds that the confiscations amount to \"an assault upon the white farming community, the rape of their properties and the deprivation of their livelihoods\". Mrs Davies's farm was invaded by \"war veterans\" in March. Within weeks her husband Douglas died of a heart attack. She blames the stress of the land seizure. After the confiscation order was served, Mrs Davies went to Harare to stay with her daughter. She refuses to speak to the press. Although Mr Mugabe has vowed repeatedly that his government will not pay a penny for the soil he says was originally stolen from blacks by British colonists, the government is legally obliged to compensate Mrs Davies for her house and farm buildings. But the two sides have not even begun to discuss an amount and the farmers union doubts she will see any money soon.",

Mr Gore will announce his vice-presidential running-mate in Nashville on Tuesday, before travelling to the Democratic convention, which opens in Los Angeles on August 14.</p> <p>These are crucial days for Mr Gore, who must regain the initiative from the increasingly upbeat Republicans, who left Philadelphia yesterday confident that their candidate is leading his party back to the White House after eight years on the political sidelines.</p> <p>Mr Bush chose not to use his convention speech for the fire-and-brimstone Clinton-bashing which delights Republican activists but alienates less narrow-minded voters.</p> <p>\"For eight years, the Clinton-Gore administration has coasted through prosperity,\" he told his audience. \"Our current president embodied the potential of a generation.

      "bodyText": "George W Bush took his re-energised Republican presidential campaign straight to the battleground states of the American midwest yesterday, aiming to add to his formidable poll lead over the Democrat Al Gore in the wake of this week's made-for-television Republican convention in Philadelphia. Just hours after the razzmatazz that followed his 52-minute acceptance speech on Thursday night, Mr Bush flew to Pittsburgh with his running-mate Dick Cheney to start a three-day swoop through Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois: four traditional swing states which may hold the key to the White House once again on November 7. \"We're in for a tough campaign, but we know it and we're ready,\" he told party leaders at a breakfast rally before leaving Philadelphia. \"As we depart the city of brotherly love, we depart with a good feeling in our heart.\" Though no politician ever admits feeling anything but good about his election prospects, Mr Bush has a better claim than most right now. Even before the convention, the latest Gallup poll showed him with an 11-point lead over Mr Gore. Day-by-day tracking polls in convention week also suggested a strong swing to Mr Bush by independents and women, the two groups of voters who were the principal targets of the relentless four-day \"compassionate conservatism\" showcase in Philadelphia. As Mr Bush flew out in search of post-convention \"bounce\", Mr Gore got back into the action with a speech to firefighters in Chicago after spending this week on a seaside holiday in North Carolina. Mr Gore will announce his vice-presidential running-mate in Nashville on Tuesday, before travelling to the Democratic convention, which opens in Los Angeles on August 14. These are crucial days for Mr Gore, who must regain the initiative from the increasingly upbeat Republicans, who left Philadelphia yesterday confident that their candidate is leading his party back to the White House after eight years on the political sidelines. Mr Bush chose not to use his convention speech for the fire-and-brimstone Clinton-bashing which delights Republican activists but alienates less narrow-minded voters. \"For eight years, the Clinton-Gore administration has coasted through prosperity,\" he told his audience. \"Our current president embodied the potential of a generation. So many talents. So much charm. Such great skill. But in the end, to what end? So much promise, to no great purpose.\" He took noticeable pains to present himself as a healer rather than an avenger - and he even went out of his way to acknowledge his own misspent youth. He believed in forgiveness, he said, \"because I have needed it.\" But he chided the Democrats for neglecting the military, the schools and the elderly - the Republican strategists' three main policy battlegrounds. While careful to play to the uncommitted television audience - especially female and minority voters - Mr Bush also gave conservatives a lot of what they wanted. He pledged himself to a round of tax cuts, to the deployment of a national missile defence, to parental power in schools, to no new gun laws, and - potentially the most controversial of all - to supporting a ban on late-term, or \"partial birth\" abortions. Conspicuously absent from his speech was any but the most perfunctory mention of world affairs. Nor did he say anything much about environmental issues, and he did not mention his pro-big-business agenda, even though he is committed to a range of measures which will lift many legal restrains from his party's biggest corporate backers. Party people Bush family Supplanting the Kennedys as America's premier political dynasty, there were starring cameos from George Sr, family matriarch Barbara, wife Laura, daughters Barbara and Jenna, brother Jeb, nephews George P and Pierce.

This, after all, is the man who told Guardian readers of his relief that it was George Robertson rather than Michael Portillo who had won the top job at Nato: \"To have lost Mr Portillo would have been to have lost a very good looking man from English politics. This is a loss that the general public, I feel, would simply not tolerate.\"</p> <p>Yet this is not the man you meet. In his first interview since defecting from the Tories to Labour Massow is not the loud, vain performer of media stereotype. Instead, he pitches up in a VW Polo, wearing dark jeans and a fairly grubby, navy polo shirt - even though he knows he is going to be photographed. It is Classic FM on the car radio, not songs from the shows.</p> <p>His speech is halting and, if anything, unconfident. He is shy, too - refusing to show off his striking new home, an originally Jacobean manor house in Frome, Somerset. (\"My partner's there right now, and he doesn't want to do it.\")</p> <p>At his side, as if for protection, is a minder from Millbank. It is the senior press officer Lance Price, who turns out to be the first Labour official Massow contacted to discuss his possible conversion. It is a testament to Labour's enduring faith in discipline (some would say control freakery) that Price's presence was a condition for the interview going ahead at all.</p> <p>The result of all this is to make Massow look very different from the showy homo of media imagination. He is more thoughtful, more complicated than that. And the same is true of his political switch. Some have dismissed it as a flash in the pan gesture from a fly by night politico, a man who was a Conservative candidate for the London mayoralty one minute, a drop out from the race the next. But that impression would be wrong, too.</p> <p><b> Journey</b><br></p> <p>Ask Massow when his journey towards Labour began and he gives an answer measured not in weeks or months, but years. \"It started an awfully long time ago,\" he says, by now sitting in a corner table in a pub in Westbury, a safe distance from his pile in Frome. \"My family was quite Conservative,\" he says, by which he means John Massow, the kindly bachelor who took him off the hands of social services a few years after young Ivan's own family had violently broken down.</p> <p>The young Massow felt the same way as his adoptive father, who had been busy teaching the working class boy middle class politics, as well as middle class manners. Even though he was just 11, he remembers his impression of the last Labour government: hyper inflation and a sense of crisis. How did he pick all that up? \"From delivering papers every morning.\"</p> <p>The Tory message made sense to him. He joined his local Young Conservatives, becoming chairman by the time he was 14 - the youngest in the country. \"I was like something out of a comic, that kid who everyone beats up at school.\"</p> <p>He overcame his chronic dyslexia to read about monetarism, about the profit motive, how socialism failed to comprehend human incentives and only capitalism understood what made people work hard. \"I was Thatcher's child.\"</p> <p>But even then, Massow says now, there was discomfort. He believed that Thatcherism was necessary for the economy, but he could also see that its impact on society was harsh: \"I felt estranged on the social issues.\" He was also aware, in his early adolescence, that he was gay, but that would not have swayed his party affiliation.</p> <p>\"People say, 'How can you, a gay person, be a Conservative?' They forget that, at that time, there was an awful lot of homophobia and prejudice in old Labour: it was northern and tough, not particularly understanding.\"</p> <p><b> Insurance </b><br></p> <p>So he carried on with the Tories, doing his bit when he fled to Bristol as a 16-year- old, with just one O-level to his name: in metalwork. (He may have had another, in photography, but he is not sure: \"I lied about them so much, I can't remember what's actually true.\") He got a job in insurance in the 1980s, amid the first tremors of the Aids scare. He watched as his own insurance company and others denied cover to gay men. He spotted the gap in the market and made gay insurance a multi-million 'pink pound' business. He now has a 70% share in a company valued at close to \u00a320m.</p> <p>At the same time he carried on his low level Conservative activity, handing out leaflets, canvassing at election time. Even in 1997 he kept the faith. \"My image of the Labour party was still that it would take us back to the 1970s - renationalise everything, taxes up to 90%, sending businesses offshore.\"</p> <p>But soon he felt his old certainties shifting. \"When Labour put interest rates in the hands of the Bank of England, that worried me as a Conservative. I thought, 'F...ing hell, they're getting the hang of this!' I found it very difficult to criticise any budget that came thereafter.\"</p> <p>For just as Labour was gaining a reputation for economic competence, Massow believed the Tories were losing theirs. Welcomed into the inner circle as a successful entrepreneur, Massow was in Central Office for the crucial meeting which decided the ill fated Tory policy of the \"tax guarantee\".</p> <p>An invited economist explained how it could all work and not a single person around the table - including William Hague - understood it. The policy would have required a Conservative government to cut taxes even in a recession, when tax revenues are down and benefit payments are up. \"That's when I started to lose faith in what we were saying. I thought we were trying to score cheap points with policies we hadn't thought through - which is what I thought Labour had done before the election.\" There were two other blows to come. Massow still harboured his adolescent ambition to be an MP. No matter that he was a high flyer, in regular email contact with Michael Portillo, summoned to talk strategy with the leader, the formal selection process found Massow fit only to be classed \"D1\" - not on the official candidates' list, but \"deferred\". It meant he had to get more experience before he was deemed fit to seek a Tory parliamentary nomination. He would have to go on a special training weekend. \"Can you imagine? There were role plays, including how to handle a television interview - and I'd been on Question Time the week before!\"</p> <p>As if to underline the absurdity of it, Massow was high profile enough to be urged to become a Tory candidate for London mayor, once Jeffrey Archer dropped out in disgrace last year. They wanted someone with \"contemporary, metropolitan values\" and Massow fitted the bill perfectly. In the end, Steve Norris re-entered the race - saving the party from having to choose from a field of \"scary\" Tory baronesses, says Massow - and he was \"unbelievably relieved\" not to have to go through with it.</p> <p>But the rarity of a liberal Tory such as Norris touched on the second, much larger problem. Massow had seen his mission within the Tory party as akin to that of Dorothy and the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz: to give it a heart (the Judy Garland analogy is his).</p> <p>\"I decided to come out in the Spectator - as a socially inclusive Conservative.\" He told Hague, Portillo and others in private what he was writing in public: that the Tories had to find a kinder, more tolerant language if they were to speak to a country that was changing. He urged them to drop their defence of section 28, which bars the promotion of homosexuality in schools. Massow even submitted a Dorothy-like paper to Hague, whose title was a variation on the Tin Man's catchphrase: \"If I only had a heart.\"</p> <p>He thought Hague would understand. \"He had voted for [age] 16 on the age of consent, he had been to the Notting Hill carnival and when I talked about all this stuff in private he seemed to agree with me.\" But then Massow would see the leader on his feet in the House of Commons, \"using the issue of section 28 so divisively, and the rhetoric got more and more unpleasant... he wasn't the person I knew.\"</p> <p><b> Losing battle</b><br></p> <p>Massow realised he was fighting a losing battle. He would be invited to speak at a Tory dinner, squaring off against Ann Widdecombe, and the diners would side with her.</p> <p>A gay friend would seek a parliamentary seat only to be rebuffed, again and again: apparently no Tory association was ready to accept an openly gay MP. Finally, Massow was at the Tory knees up known as the Blue Ball when Hague addressed the partygoers on the merits of section 28: Massow walked out in disgust.</p> <p>He talked about his growing sense of defeat with a friend he won't name in the Labour party. He suggested Massow get in touch with Lance Price, formerly a BBC political correspondent now at Labour headquarters.</p> <p>They met last week and shortly afterward Massow arranged to see his most senior Labour contact, the culture secretary, Chris Smith. That impressed Massow: having been ignored in his own party, here was a Labour cabinet minister with an open door (Smith did not know in advance what Massow wanted to discuss).</p> <p>Contrary to reports this week, the Conservative party did not make any last-minute offer to stay. That is because Massow did not give them the chance: he knew that if they had advance warning of his switch, they would get their version out before his. Instead he sent an elliptical email to his chum in the leader's office, Nicholas Gleave, which mentioned a sense of \"not belonging\" anymore. All he got were soothing noises about a future \"chat with William\".</p> <p>He was not offered a hurried peerage. Instead, it seems, that offer had been dangled, codedly, several times before - so often, in fact, that Massow had become highly doubtful that it would ever happen. The Tories had talked about Massow as a Conservative Waheed Alli, the young, gay, media peer who sits with Labour. But he was not keen to provide a \"cool, inclusive\" fig leaf for a party that he believed was neither cool nor inclusive.</p> <p>Labour did not offer him anything either. They made it clear he would have to pay his dues, that he certainly would not find a seat in time for the next general election. He has told them he wants to work on social exclusion, hence the meeting with the Cabinet Office minister, Mo Mowlam, on Wednesday. He had no meeting with Tony Blair and only met Alastair Campbell for the first time on Wednesday.</p> <p>So now it is time for a new persona for this gay Jay Gatsby, the invented man who had three different surnames by the time he was 12.</p> <p>He may still be only 32, but this week saw the end of a political journey that lasted nearly two decades - and the beginning of another one that may go all the way, even over the rainbow.</p>",

I found it very difficult to criticise any budget that came thereafter.\" For just as Labour was gaining a reputation for economic competence, Massow believed the Tories were losing theirs. Welcomed into the inner circle as a successful entrepreneur, Massow was in Central Office for the crucial meeting which decided the ill fated Tory policy of the \"tax guarantee\". An invited economist explained how it could all work and not a single person around the table - including William Hague - understood it. The policy would have required a Conservative government to cut taxes even in a recession, when tax revenues are down and benefit payments are up. \"That's when I started to lose faith in what we were saying. I thought we were trying to score cheap points with policies we hadn't thought through - which is what I thought Labour had done before the election.\" There were two other blows to come. Massow still harboured his adolescent ambition to be an MP. No matter that he was a high flyer, in regular email contact with Michael Portillo, summoned to talk strategy with the leader, the formal selection process found Massow fit only to be classed \"D1\" - not on the official candidates' list, but \"deferred\". It meant he had to get more experience before he was deemed fit to seek a Tory parliamentary nomination. He would have to go on a special training weekend. \"Can you imagine? There were role plays, including how to handle a television interview - and I'd been on Question Time the week before!\" As if to underline the absurdity of it, Massow was high profile enough to be urged to become a Tory candidate for London mayor, once Jeffrey Archer dropped out in disgrace last year. They wanted someone with \"contemporary, metropolitan values\" and Massow fitted the bill perfectly. In the end, Steve Norris re-entered the race - saving the party from having to choose from a field of \"scary\" Tory baronesses, says Massow - and he was \"unbelievably relieved\" not to have to go through with it. But the rarity of a liberal Tory such as Norris touched on the second, much larger problem. Massow had seen his mission within the Tory party as akin to that of Dorothy and the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz: to give it a heart (the Judy Garland analogy is his). \"I decided to come out in the Spectator - as a socially inclusive Conservative.\" He told Hague, Portillo and others in private what he was writing in public: that the Tories had to find a kinder, more tolerant language if they were to speak to a country that was changing. He urged them to drop their defence of section 28, which bars the promotion of homosexuality in schools. Massow even submitted a Dorothy-like paper to Hague, whose title was a variation on the Tin Man's catchphrase: \"If I only had a heart.\" He thought Hague would understand. \"He had voted for [age] 16 on the age of consent, he had been to the Notting Hill carnival and when I talked about all this stuff in private he seemed to agree with me.\" But then Massow would see the leader on his feet in the House of Commons, \"using the issue of section 28 so divisively, and the rhetoric got more and more unpleasant... he wasn't the person I knew.\" Losing battle Massow realised he was fighting a losing battle. He would be invited to speak at a Tory dinner, squaring off against Ann Widdecombe, and the diners would side with her. A gay friend would seek a parliamentary seat only to be rebuffed, again and again: apparently no Tory association was ready to accept an openly gay MP. Finally, Massow was at the Tory knees up known as the Blue Ball when Hague addressed the partygoers on the merits of section 28: Massow walked out in disgust. He talked about his growing sense of defeat with a friend he won't name in the Labour party. He suggested Massow get in touch with Lance Price, formerly a BBC political correspondent now at Labour headquarters. They met last week and shortly afterward Massow arranged to see his most senior Labour contact, the culture secretary, Chris Smith. That impressed Massow: having been ignored in his own party, here was a Labour cabinet minister with an open door (Smith did not know in advance what Massow wanted to discuss). Contrary to reports this week, the Conservative party did not make any last-minute offer to stay. That is because Massow did not give them the chance: he knew that if they had advance warning of his switch, they would get their version out before his. Instead he sent an elliptical email to his chum in the leader's office, Nicholas Gleave, which mentioned a sense of \"not belonging\" anymore. All he got were soothing noises about a future \"chat with William\". He was not offered a hurried peerage. Instead, it seems, that offer had been dangled, codedly, several times before - so often, in fact, that Massow had become highly doubtful that it would ever happen. The Tories had talked about Massow as a Conservative Waheed Alli, the young, gay, media peer who sits with Labour. But he was not keen to provide a \"cool, inclusive\" fig leaf for a party that he believed was neither cool nor inclusive. Labour did not offer him anything either. They made it clear he would have to pay his dues, that he certainly would not find a seat in time for the next general election. He has told them he wants to work on social exclusion, hence the meeting with the Cabinet Office minister, Mo Mowlam, on Wednesday. He had no meeting with Tony Blair and only met Alastair Campbell for the first time on Wednesday. So now it is time for a new persona for this gay Jay Gatsby, the invented man who had three different surnames by the time he was 12. He may still be only 32, but this week saw the end of a political journey that lasted nearly two decades - and the beginning of another one that may go all the way, even over the rainbow.",

It has made me rebel against it. \" Hina contacted authorities including police and social services in advance, warning that her family would pull out all the stops to find her. Still at school, she knew she would not be able to escape without support. She fled her home during the night. Her parents immediately contacted police, filing a missing person's report. But because they were forewarned, detectives refused to divulge Hina's whereabouts to her family. \"Even through mediation with social services, my family still threatened me if I didn't go back. Although I translated their threats to the police officers and social workers, they didn't believe I was really being threatened because they didn't hear the threats first hand. \"My father said he wanted to punish me and my mother accused me of making her ill because I have ruined the family's reputation.\" Hina believes the government is still unaware of the true dangers facing women like her. \"But if they put into practice what they are promising, we may see a difference.\"",

Thanks to arduous proselytising by Chris (and some help from Hatchard's bookshop) it's taken off. The book keeps going in and out of the best-seller lists, and has sold 60,000 copies so far.

This is, however, erroneous, as this was the number of the July 22 edition - both editions now carry the same edition number. </p> <p>\"I consider this to be a very serious mistake, the more so while this is not the first time this very mistake is made. You may recall that I sent you a similar letter on September 28, 1971 - I was then promised that this would not happen again.\" </p> <p>I sent the following reply: \"Thank you for your email pointing out a serious anomaly in the recent numbering of Guardian editions. I took the opportunity to draw your letter to the attention of the senior editorial staff of the Guardian at the editor's meeting this morning where I read it aloud. I am sure greater efforts will be made in future.\" </p> <p>The editor's meeting, it would be true to say, broke up on hearing this complaint and, rather unusually, several journalists expressed the hope that it would feature prominently in the following day's corrections. It did not do that because I came to the conclusion that it was a carefully contrived hoax, rather cunningly arranged with a mistake both in the language (\"while\") and the dating of the last letter of complaint (1971). These were clearly designed to suggest, once I had begun to suspect its authenticity, that it had come from a journalist on the Guardian. </p> <p>Authentic or not, it wonderfully represented a tone of voice with which I have become quite familiar, the relentless monotone of the compulsive pedant. There is something of the pedant in all of us, of course. In you and me it is present as a perfectly healthy ingredient of a balanced personality. But in the others . . . Happily they represent only a minority in the total who call - about 18,000 of you since the office opened in 1997. </p> <p>Readers of the Guardian who write to complain often add a message of sympathy and encouragement. Mr Seagroatt of Liverpool wrote recently, \"The apparent insouciance with which you carry out the labours of Sisyphus is admirable.\" (Thank you for the perceptive \"apparent\".) Even Private Eye was moved to suggest that perhaps no one since Sisyphus had undertaken such an impossible task as the one I have. </p> <p>Sisyphus, if I may remind you, was in Greek mythology the king of Corinth whose punishment in Hades was to roll a huge stone up a hill only for it to roll down, causing him to start all over again, and so on and on (I recommend <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com\">britannica.com</a> for more details). </p> <p>Here is something I happened to be reading, quite coincidentally, which describes this aspect of my task perfectly: \"Now begins a Sisyphean labour. The ball, that enormous burden, is painfully hoisted, step by step . . . to a certain height, always backwards . . . An ill-advised movement frustrates all this toil; the ball rolls down dragging the bearer with it . . . He begins over again with indefatigable obstinacy. Ten times, 20 times, he will attempt the hopeless ascent . . .\" </p> <p>This is a description of a creature with which, on a bad day, I can readily identify, the dung beetle as observed by the naturalist Jean-Henri Fabre. </p> <p>Readers also encourage us to continue with this toil of owning up and correcting by pointing out now and again that errors in newspapers range widely through time and space. Margaret Manuell, browsing through the archives of the Tamworth Herald, unearthed the following in the issue of December 25, 1880: </p> <p>A correction: It will be almost unnecessary to inform our readers that the words \"awful and honorable life\" which occurred in the notice of Mr Stretton's death in our last, should read \"useful and honourable life\". </p> <p>My correspondent added, \"An ill-chosen word and a spelling mistake. The Guardian couldn't have done it better.\" </p> <p> The following, from the Canberra Times of July 6, this year, was also drawn to my attention: </p> <p>Correction: The late Edythe Butler, BEM, was incorrectly referred to as \"Edy the Butler\" in About Town on Tuesday. This was a subeditor's error. </p> <p>Ah. That's it, blame the subs. Although, perhaps we should indeed blame them for the variations in the spelling of a Californian place name in G2 this week. It should have been Stevens Creek, a title never bestowed upon it in the piece, in which it appeared variously as Stephen's Creek, Steven's Creek, and, wait for it, Jacob's Creek, a name usually associated with an Australian wine.

      "body": "<p>August is a month for camping, not least in London theatre. In the excellent Pirates of Penzance in Regent's Park, the police are treated as fairy-footed rozzers led by the spryly twinkling Stephen Matthews. And Pageant, a spoof American beauty contest which has just moved from the King's Head to the Vaudeville, is played by men in drag and is camper than the proverbial Chloe. </p> <p>\"Camp\" itself is a multi-coloured word. According to my Shorter Oxford Dictionary, its origins are unknown. But we all recognise it when we see it. </p> <p>Any definition of high camp would include Oscar Wilde, much of Noel Coward, the musicals of Sandy Wilson, the novels of Ronald Firbank and EF Benson, and Vincent Price's horror movies. Examples of low camp would be the Carry On movies, Round the Horne, Larry Grayson, and Frankie Howerd. Indeed, it was the last who once provided a memorable negative definition. Glancing furtively at his prim lady pianist, he gossipingly confided that she was so out of touch she thought Richard Dimbleby was camp. </p> <p>What is fascinating is how camp has spread far beyond the gay community. The exchanges of Jules and Sandy on Round the Horne have become part of comic folklore. \"Did you drag yourselves up on deck?\" they were famously asked after a violent sea storm. To which the response was: \"No, just sweaters and jeans.\" </p> <p>Straight entertainers, for generations, have also used the armoury of camp. George Robey dolled himself up as Queen Victoria; Max Miller sported dazzling rainbow-coloured suits; Barry Humphries has transformed Melbourne's Edna Everage from a dowdy suburbanite into a glittering superstar dame with a talent to abuse. </p> <p>But camp, as Pageant currently proves, has its limitations. It thrives best when its form of epicene exaggeration has a hetero counterpoint. Jules and Sandy were funny precisely because they were quizzed by Kenneth Horne, who seemed innocently oblivious to their riotous double-entendres. Kenneth Williams and Charles Hawtrey could wince and mince through the Carry On movies because they were offset by the roguish earthiness of Sid James and Barbara Windsor. </p> <p>Even in a show like Regent's Park's Pirates of Penzance the campy cavortings of the cops contrast with the four-square Englishness of Paul Bradley's Major-General.

      "bodyText": "August is a month for camping, not least in London theatre. In the excellent Pirates of Penzance in Regent's Park, the police are treated as fairy-footed rozzers led by the spryly twinkling Stephen Matthews. And Pageant, a spoof American beauty contest which has just moved from the King's Head to the Vaudeville, is played by men in drag and is camper than the proverbial Chloe. \"Camp\" itself is a multi-coloured word. According to my Shorter Oxford Dictionary, its origins are unknown. But we all recognise it when we see it. Any definition of high camp would include Oscar Wilde, much of Noel Coward, the musicals of Sandy Wilson, the novels of Ronald Firbank and EF Benson, and Vincent Price's horror movies. Examples of low camp would be the Carry On movies, Round the Horne, Larry Grayson, and Frankie Howerd. Indeed, it was the last who once provided a memorable negative definition. Glancing furtively at his prim lady pianist, he gossipingly confided that she was so out of touch she thought Richard Dimbleby was camp. What is fascinating is how camp has spread far beyond the gay community. The exchanges of Jules and Sandy on Round the Horne have become part of comic folklore. \"Did you drag yourselves up on deck?\" they were famously asked after a violent sea storm. To which the response was: \"No, just sweaters and jeans.\" Straight entertainers, for generations, have also used the armoury of camp. George Robey dolled himself up as Queen Victoria; Max Miller sported dazzling rainbow-coloured suits; Barry Humphries has transformed Melbourne's Edna Everage from a dowdy suburbanite into a glittering superstar dame with a talent to abuse. But camp, as Pageant currently proves, has its limitations. It thrives best when its form of epicene exaggeration has a hetero counterpoint. Jules and Sandy were funny precisely because they were quizzed by Kenneth Horne, who seemed innocently oblivious to their riotous double-entendres. Kenneth Williams and Charles Hawtrey could wince and mince through the Carry On movies because they were offset by the roguish earthiness of Sid James and Barbara Windsor. Even in a show like Regent's Park's Pirates of Penzance the campy cavortings of the cops contrast with the four-square Englishness of Paul Bradley's Major-General. Camp, at its best, is about contradiction: a classic example is George Melly, who hymns love and lust while arrayed like Solomon in all his glory. The reason that Pageant - conceived, I'm delighted to note, by Robert Longbottom - palls after a while is that, having struck camp, it has nowhere much to go. It parodies the tacky vacuity of beauty pageants by casting men as the rival contestants. It also creates a mock-suspense by getting audience members to vote for the winning queen. On the first night the prize rightly went to Leon Maurice-Jones, who, as Miss Industrial North-East, shows an astonishing capacity to do cartwheels and play the accordion while on roller-skates. But I suspect the show would be much funnier if it were compered by a po-faced straightman; instead it has Lionel Blair, who, with his spangled hair and salmon pink evening dress, seems in complicity with the very world outside which he supposedly stands. Undeniably Pageant has some very funny moments: many of the best come from the toothy, horse-faced Miles Western, who plays Miss West Coast as a dippy, spaced-out creature who seems to have descended from another planet. At one point, as he seeks to demonstrate a new line in strap-on deodorants, he almost strangles himself in his choker and is reduced to suppressed sneezes by the intoxicating odours.

      "body": "<p>The second half of Wagner's Ring cycle, in the operas Siegfried and G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, tells of the doomed lives and loves of Siegfried and Br\u00fcnnhilde, archetypal figures of heroism. But even in the dragon-slaying, wife-winning exploits of the young Siegfried, there is little sense of untrammelled joy in J\u00fcrgen Flimm's new production at Wagner's own theatre in Bayreuth. When Siegfried kills Fafner (the giant who transformed himself into a dragon to protect the gold he won in the first work of the cycle, Das Rheingold), Siegfried's sword lays waste to an entire ecosystem. As the smoke clears from Fafner's carcass - a metal and flesh homunculus like one of David Cronenberg's nightmarish visions - Erich Wonder's sets reveal a scorched wasteland. Decay - environmental and ethical - has set in. </p> <p>But Wolfgang Schmidt's Siegfried is blissfully unaware of this rot. From the moment we meet him, he is an arrogant brat who delights in using his strength to humiliate the dwarf Mime, his ageing, thieving guardian. Siegfried is no hero, just an overgrown boy. Like Flimm's portrayal of the gods in Das Rheingold, Siegfried is profoundly, fallibly flawed. Schmidt's singing of the part has a winning openness but his enthusiasm occasionally spills over into a clumsiness of intonation and articulation. </p> <p>When Siegfried frees Br\u00fcnnhilde from her enchanted sleep in the third act of the opera, he is forced to confront, for the first time, someone over whom he has no power. Their duet is one of the most vocally and intellectually taxing in the operatic repertoire, especially at conductor Giuseppe Sinopoli's slow tempos. Although blusteringly powerful, the combination of Gabriele Schnaut's Br\u00fcnnhilde and Schmidt's Siegfried does not create the same momentum as their orchestral underpinning. Indeed, the outstanding moments of this Siegfried involve Alan Titus's Wotan. In the snowy remnants of the set from the end of Das Rheingold, Wotan, the king of the gods, movingly finds a kind of reconciliation, albeit a masochistic one, when the mortal hero Siegfried's sword breaks his spear confirming the end of the gods and the independence of Siegfried. </p> <p>By the time of the final opera of the cycle, G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, the wastes of the landscapes in Siegfried have been transformed into a seething, industrial heartland from which every vestige of nature has been eradicated. The undoubted leader of this rotten renewal is Hagen, son of the dwarf Alberich, whose theft of power-bestowing gold from the Rhinemaidens began the entire story of the Ring. Wonder has made the Gibichung Hall a gleaming, triple-tiered waiting-room, from which Hagen, and his half-brother and sister Gunther and Gutrune, plan their world domination. </p> <p>John Tomlinson's Hagen orchestrates his pursuit of power with conspiratorial vehemence. As magnificently strong vocally as he is broodingly brilliant as an actor, Tomlinson gives the most complete performance of this Ring. His Hagen is a dark reflection of Titus's Wotan, but Hagen's lust is hollow, empty and pretentious. In the hellish airport-lounge of Wonder's sets, Hagen inhabits a world of pure surface, a mere frame for his unquenchable bitterness. </p> <p>Hagen is the most significant mirroring in a G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung that is suffused with reminiscences and doppelgangers. Siegfried is murdered by Hagen where Fafner's geometric skeleton lies, becoming an outsider where he was once triumphant. Br\u00fcnnhilde's climactic immolation scene - in which Schnaut finds her most convincing and sensitive singing - is played out against situations and scenery from the whole cycle. Wonder's symbolism careers finally towards the interchangeable surfaces of a series of backdrops. The end of the gods, in this staging, is the collapse of the imagery on to a point of total emptiness. But the final gesture of the production is of a warrior (Br\u00fcnnhilde, perhaps?) alone on the vastness of the Bayreuth stage - an enigmatic vision of isolation and an unattainable heroic ideal. </p> <p>Over the course of all four operas of the Ring cycle, Flimm and Wonder make Wagner's epic speak with a directness that is contemporary and mythological. Allied to Sinopoli's liquid, lucid conducting, this Ring is rigorously focused on the human allegories at the heart of the story. The cycle's continuing relevance could scarcely find more compelling expression.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Alan Ayckbourn was explaining how his plays become hits to a man who runs amusement arcade slot machines in Scarborough . First, they're tried out in the resort's theatre, next they transfer to the West End, \"then, if I'm lucky, they go to America or Holland or wherever. And each place they go, I get paid.\" </p> <p>The slot machine man, \"a bit of a wide boy,\" Ayckbourn admits admiringly, was intrigued - \"but how do you get the actual money?\" There was no mystery, said the playwright, with his usual anxious modesty, \"the theatre collects a percentage and just sends it to my agent\". The slot-machine man bellowed, \"they just hand over the money? That's fucking brilliant. I have to empty these machines myself, every day. 'Ere, George!\" And Ayckbourn had to describe the whole system to George again. </p> <p>During rehearsals for his 54th and 55th plays, the linked House/Garden, Ayckbourn said: \"Suddenly I've got credibility in Scarborough - for this scam. And I've managed to explain what I am doing there now: I am running an international racket.\" And he laughs, not his guffaw, but his other one - the funny internal sort of gurgle, an almost private sign of some personal satisfaction. </p> <p>It's a revealing tale. In the theatre world Ayckbourn is decisively a man of the people. His friends say he feels it is important to be accepted by ordinary people with ordinary jobs for doing something real. So his plays are designed to be immediately accessible. Nothing matters to him more than getting the audience in. It always has. It was a ground rule imparted by his mentor, Stephen Joseph, after whom Ayckbourn's theatre-in-the-round in Scarborough is named. He was the wild and inspiring son of Michael Joseph the publisher and Hermione Baddeley, the great revue comedienne of the 30s and 40s. Joseph's brief to the then 20-year- old actor was \"to write plays that would fill the theatre\". He's been doing that for 30 years. But Ayckbourn adds now: \"They also had to be worthy of my peers and colleagues who were sharing the dressing room with me in Scarborough. They'd mostly come a long way up from London and made quite big cuts in their living standards to do so. If I'd given them tacky seaside stuff they'd say, 'Look, I could have been doing telly.'\" </p> <p>Ayckbourn is acutely aware of the importance of his adopted home town. The Stephen Joseph Theatre has been his laboratory all his working life. Sir Peter Hall, who vigorously championed him at the National in the mid-80s, describes it as \"a large playroom for him to work out his fantasies and anxieties\". </p> <p>Ayckbourn first went there as an actor aged 18; then in 1970, three years after Joseph died, he became its director. His artistic policy has always been dictated by the need to fill the theatre. But Scarborough isn't London, where there's an audience for anything - for a while, says Ayckbourn. So if he were to do a season of Beckett, he'd probably have to close the theatre down: \"They wouldn't come. There would just be a few from the technical college saying, 'Great. You should do more of this.'\" </p> <p>This determined populism has been the basis for his theatrical credo, combined with the playfulness of his technical craftsmanship, a belief in comedy as a vehicle for his social comment, and his uncanny ability to flirt with the middle classes' sense of themselves - to flay them alive before their eyes and yet have them come back time and again to watch. </p> <p>The milieu of his plays was set very early. Despite having lived in Yorkshire since he was 19, almost all his work is set in the south of England, where he was brought up. He always says that most of his plays are located \"somewhere north of Reading\". They are populated by ruthless little go-getters, philanderers, small men, brave women, bullish opportunists, dreadful do-good ers and, often the only admirable characters, the feckless and the failures. They are all sharply aware of their place in the pecking order and most of them are determined to change it to the disadvantage of others. Men torture their wives emotionally and women go quietly mad through neglect. </p> <p>There is a darkness in his view of human relationships. He watches us inflict awful cruelty on each other, more often than not during the family rituals of birthdays, Christmasses, meals, funerals and marriages. He appears to be deeply pessimistic about the state of relationships between men and women. And in his own tentative way, he's a moralist. He was shocked by the 90s, by what he has called \"all that Thatcherite money-making on everybody else's back, which made us a completely uncaring society\". </p> <p>He told the cast rehearsing the new plays: \"You'll notice in my plays that anyone who mistreats, misbehaves or deceives tends to get their comeuppance. [However] I am probably guilty of tidying up the world a bit because things tend to happen rather quicker in plays than in the real world. Although Robert Maxwell did fall overboard.\" </p> <p>Perhaps his greatest distinction is as an experimenter with comic form and theatrical diversity. He is a puckish manipulator of dramatic structure, deriving enormous pleasure from the fact that audiences go along with the devices. \"The myth that you have to write sim plistically for the masses is so patronising. Audiences love to be challenged.\" </p> <p>And he has altered the rules quite considerably by taking light comedy and using it to tackle ideas and subjects that, when he started as a dramatist, wouldn't have been included. A Small Family Business, possibly his best work, which in 1987 took \u00a31m at the National Theatre box office, was a comedy which nonetheless ended with a girl dying of an overdose on a lavatory seat while a party was in full swing downstairs. As he says: \"It might have been written in a lighter moment by Sarah Kane\". </p> <p>His daring with dramatic structure is reflected in the form he has constructed for House/Garden, which open at the Royal National Theatre in London next Wednesday, where the two plays are performed simultaneously in adjacent auditoriums. Members of the cast appear in both, running between them backstage. In House/Garden each audience knows there is another play going on and that feeds the sense that it is all happening at that moment specifically for them, which Ayckbourn believes is what his job is about - \"giving people the impression that they have arrived at just the right moment, in just the right seat, to see the right sequence of events\", as he wrote in 1993. </p> <p>Alan Ayckbourn was born in London in 1939. His father, first violin in the London Symphony Orchestra, ran away with the second violin when Alan was only five. His mother then embarked on what he has called \"a series of highly unsuitable and unrewarding relationships\", including marrying the local bank manager when they moved to West Sussex. He went as a boarder to the local prep school and then, from the age of seven, to the minor public school Haileybury . \"It was quite strange. You had no family really. Your life became more and more about those months at school because you came home and you knew no-one. Women were a bit strange, too, because you didn't see them much.\" </p> <p>His father, Horace, \"was a great philanderer. I liked him very much, though. He was quite a bit older than my mother. He lived in Norfolk and bred St Bernard dogs. He died when I was 12 or 13.\" </p> <p>The major influence in his life was undoubtedly his mother, Irene, who supported herself and the young Ayckbourn by writing for women's magazines under the pen name of Mary James, although, to most family friends, she was always known as Lolly. Her attitudes and experiences determined much of what he has written. It is seen in what the Guardian critic Michael Billington calls \"his frankly feminist viewpoint\". Ayckbourn confirms this: \"If you live with your mother after a succession of men have left her, you tend to be slightly biased. Men are pretty unreliable.\" On the front cover of his collected plays is a seaside postcard with a rhyme - Mother's Boy - about a boy kissing a girl and being teased by her about what his mother will think. </p> <p>He left school convinced he was going to be an actor. At Haileybury he did a great number of plays, including the Brian Rix farce Reluctant Heroes. It was an ambi tious project for a 16-year-old. He was lucky to have one master who was \"a theatre nut\" - Edgar Mathews. Every year in the summer holidays he took the boys on tour abroad with a play. But Ayckbourn's housemaster was pushing him towards higher education. \"He called me in before I left and said 'What do you want to be?'. I said 'an actor'. I remember him slamming the careers book shut and saying, 'Well, my friend, if you want to make a howling ass of yourself, who am I to stop you?'.\" </p> <p>The school now has a fully equipped theatre named after Ayckbourn. When he opened it he met the housemaster again, but didn't mention the incident to him. As he tells it, \"he just said 'My friend, you seem to have done very well for yourself'.\" </p> <p>Ayckbourn was married at 19, to Christine Roland, and by 25 he had two sons, Steven and Philip, and was a drama director at BBC Radio. Both boys now work in theatre, Steven in Scarborough. The marriage did not last. It made Ayckbourn very angry that people so young were pushed into marriage. \"I still think we never allow kids to consider what it means to have children. It's an unbelievable responsibility for the rest of your life, if you're going to do it seriously. And if you're not, then have a dog or a canary or something. You end up with abandoned babies or girls who want to kill themselves. But when I was growing up it was all about finding someone and promising yourself to them for life. And I was very angry that anyone allowed me to make that sort of vow. It wasn't an easy thing to walk away.\" </p> <p>Eventually he did, after about six years, although he didn't get divorced for another 35. \"I went through a stage when I thought it would be good to stay married to Christine so that she couldn't marry anyone else. I couldn't let anyone else go through that.\" He married his long-time personal assistant, Heather Stoney, in 1997. Legend has it that, with a knighthood possible, he waited until the honour was bestowed so that he could divorce and then remarry: that way there would be two Lady Ayckbourns. He doesn't demur. </p> <p>Ayckbourn is undoubtedly a writer for women. His men are emotionally stunted and, you imagine, small in every way. His women are a much richer canvas. Julia McKenzie, who had particular success in Communicating Doors and Woman In Mind, says simply, \"he likes women, he understands women and he does write for women. You just feel with him that you could chat about any women's problems. He's in no way not butch, but I can natter on to him like I would to a girlfriend.\" She also confirms something everyone says about him, that he is very shy. Roger Glossop, the designer, who has now worked with him since 1986, says, \"He's still a bit of a mystery. I really don't think I know him. His mind is elsewhere a lot of the time.\" </p> <p>The shyness masks an emotional turmoil. Ayckbourn says of himself, \"I have a great cauldron of emotional mess and it all spews out in the plays.\" Mackenzie says. \"You feel he might blow, although I've never seen him do so.\" </p> <p>There is particular vehemence about a set of recurring characters in his plays who apparently have no emotions. There is one in House/Garden, a speechwriter, obviously Tory, and in Ayckbourn's tradition of characters with names like Marmion Cedilla, Lester Trainsmith, or Carla Pepperbloom, is called Gavin Ryng-Mayne. </p> <p>Ayckbourn describes him as \"able to control his feelings, unlike the rest of us who fall in love, care, sometimes feel vulnerable. But these people manage to turn away. And they're frightening. They watch and they have a strength as a result of that. They're the people I fear I might have been, could have been or even am.\" Peter Hall rather grandly calls this his \"divine discontent with himself\", and adds that as he gets older Ayckbourn's plays \"reveal more and more of himself\". </p> <p>This ability to experiment and stretch as a dramatist comes from his position in Scarborough, where he writes, produces and directs. As he says, \"I am not the best director of my plays, but I'm the best one I know. It cuts out the middle man.\" Michael Billington points out \"there are simply no other writers who have their own theatre\". Ayckbourn constructs a company around him, and people work with him again and again - Glossop, the designer for 14 years; Michael Gambon, his star actor for 20. </p> <p>But Scarborough gives him more than control. It gives him a regular audience which allows him to practise theatre in a community where he belongs. He has, in the way of those who are rootless in childhood, zealously adopted this Yorkshire seaside resort as home. And it colours his view of what theatre is and why it matters. \"I strongly believe - I'm a regionalist of course - that theatre is the forum where we discuss ideas and also ourselves. And we do it in a way that you cannot do in the movies, which are one-sided arguments made by someone a million miles away, purveyed by people who are 17 times your size. Which is just nothing like watching Hamlet die a few feet in front of you.\" </p> <p> In an eight-month season, the theatre produces one new show of his a year - said to be gestated for months but actually written at great speed in just four weeks - and as much new writing as it can risk at the box office. It seeks out new work by writers who wish to reach a wider public, the people Ayckbourn describes as the ones who believe they're not theatregoers. </p> <p>For this the theatre gets \u00a3450,000 a year from Yorkshire Arts, \u00a353,000 from North Yorkshire Council, and \u00a3207,000 from Scarborough Council. Despite the theatre also earning \u00a3650,000 in commercial income, the town has wobbled in its commitment. In 1997 there was the celebrated \"luvvies versus lavvies\" dispute when the redoubtable philistinism of the British reared up in the form of a local councillor who said that the theatre grant would mean closing the town's 22 public lavatories. The headline writers could hardly believe their luck. The local paper was full of inarticulate praise for the public conveniences as a major Scarborough attraction, and Ayckbourn lost his rag. \"If you happen to be teetotal in this town, then God help you - because there is little else to do apart from get drunk and buy shoes,\" he wrote. The council later relented. </p> <p>For all the ongoing debate about the best way of keeping theatre alive, in his book it comes down to one thing: \"I have been out to lunch with successive arts minis ters who say, 'OK, Alan, tell us what the problem is'. And I say, 'money'. And they say 'Apart from that'. It's nothing to do with anything but money. I feel like a man in a house with no roof, the rain pouring in, and people offering money to build a conservatory. I just want some roofing tiles.\" </p> <p>In the town, Ayckbourn retains the affections of a great number of locals. Ian Grundy and Bob Harris, who run the guesthouse, Interludes, whose clients come just to see the plays, say, \"Scarborough can't buy the kind of publicity Alan brings\". They have seen every play and their verdict is that \"he is getting even funnier\". Bob Watson, a retired local English teacher, was a reluctant convert, chaperoning his wife and daughter under protest to his first Ayckbourn, Confusions, in the early 70s. \"I was just staggered,\" he says, starting the kind of knowing commentary on the writing that can only come from an intense involvement in the whole body of work. </p> <p>Ayckbourn is richer than he admits. His agents put the royalties alone at \"well over a million a year\". Ayckbourn says \"a million a year? I wish it was. I work in theatre, you know, I don't do movies.\" But he also gives a lot to his theatre. It is a matter of record that he has worked as artistic director without drawing a salary for 30 years, and that he pays for a casting director. But, according to friends, he also donates a considerable amount of his royalties to the Stephen Joseph and he bought the lease on the current building for an estimated \u00a3200,000, in partnership with Charles McCarthy, the UK chairman of McCain's chips, and Lord Down, both great local supporters of the theatre. Some estimate that his personal contribution to the bid for National Lottery funding which enabled them to buy and open the new building in 1996 was about \u00a3400,000. </p> <p>Ayckbourn is not only part of a great but now-fragile tradition of regional civic theatre, but also of the stream of English dramatists from Shakespeare through the Restoration to the Kitchen Sink, although perhaps not yet including the smack and sodomy kids of Shopping And Fucking and Blasted. But he grew up in theatre's changing landscape. Emerging as an actor just after 1956 when Osborne, Pinter and Wesker were beginning to get established, he also had the advantage of playing Coward and Rattigan in weekly repertory. It is clear that he feels part of both movements but ultimately he decided on a commitment to popular work and to write plays which he says \"are simply about people\". </p> <p>It is that which, out of snobbery, prevents some people taking him seriously.Peter Hall says that there \"is still some feeling that if a play is commercial it somehow doesn't belong in the subsidised theatre and that we should be doing plays about distant indigenous tribes in loose poetic rhyme\". If you want a reputation of significance, that's a fatal error. And it's compounded if you not only choose to write comedies but produce one a year - and then in the provinces. Yet, as a writer in English, Ayckbourn is second only to Shakespeare in terms of the number of times his plays are produced around the world. Every year in Britain there are 25 to 30 professional productions of Ayckbourn, and his work goes around the world, with translations in 34 languages. Later this year the National Theatre of Taiwan in Taipei will revive its hugely successful national tour of Communicating Doors in Cantonese. The German theatre critic Gerhard Stadelmaier called Ayckbourn, whose popularity in Germany almost tops that in Britain, \"the Moli\u00e8re of the middle classes\". </p> <p>Critics, however, are divided about his reputation. Is he just a \"pretty farceur\" - a populist boulevard writer churning out commercial comedy hits based on theatrical trickery, and a writer with no sustainable claim on posterity? Or does a body of work which contains Relatively Speaking, Absurd Person Singular, The Norman Conquests, Absent Friends, Bedroom Farce and A Chorus Of Disapproval, make him \"one of our most serious dramatists, comparable with Pinter, Hare and Stoppard\", as Michael Billington described him? </p> <p>The two new plays are about the deceptive nature of reality; they show people from different angles, so certain things appear funny until you see them from a different perspective. Ayckbourn is reluctant to intellectualise, but will admit that his work has some kind of philosophical impact. But he has a horror that people will draw back from going to his shows if they feel they're going to be preached at. </p> <p>He saw this happen to one of his contemporaries, Harold Pinter, early on in his career. Ayckbourn says, \"to me, he wrote wonderful plays. But they became so studied, so interpreted that you couldn't walk near them without having a BA.\" Analysis clouded the theatrical experience, and even Pinter himself resisted that. In his early days as an actor, Ayckbourn was once directed by Pinter in one of Pinter's own plays. As he was feeling his way into the part, he asked the playwright, \"Where does this guy come from?\" Pinter replied: \"Mind your own fucking business.\" </p> <p>Despite the critics' snobbery it is clear that he is one of the nation's most intuitive chroniclers, particularly foreshadowing what would come to fruition in the 80s with the decline of the professional classes before the advance of thrusting opportunists. As Hall says, \"He has an acute social sense of what it was like to live in England in the last half of the 20th century. And for that, as much as any dramatist, he is required reading\". </p> <p>\u0095 House/Garden open at the National Theatre, Upper Ground, London SE1 on August 9</p> <p><strong>Life at a glance - Alan Ayckbourn</strong></p> <p> <strong>Born:</strong> April 12 1939, Hampstead, London<br> Educated: Haileybury, Herts. <strong>Married:</strong> 1959 Christine Roland (two sons, Steven, Philip), dissolved; October 1997 Heather Stoney.<br> <strong>Career:</strong><br> 1957 actor, Theatre-in- the-Round, Scarborough; 1962-70 BBC radio drama producer, Leeds; 1971- artistic director, Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough; director, National Theatre 1986-7. <strong>Some plays:</strong> 1959 The Square Cat, 1965 Relatively Speaking, 1972 Absurd Person Singular, 1973 The Norman Conquests, 1977 Bedroom Farce, 1979 Joking Apart, 1982 Way Upstream, 1985 A Chorus Of Disapproval, 1987 A Small Family Business, 1996 Communicating Doors, 1998 Things We Do For Love, 2000 House/Garden. <br> <strong>Honours:</strong> 1987 CBE; 1997 knighted.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Alan Ayckbourn was explaining how his plays become hits to a man who runs amusement arcade slot machines in Scarborough . First, they're tried out in the resort's theatre, next they transfer to the West End, \"then, if I'm lucky, they go to America or Holland or wherever. And each place they go, I get paid.\" The slot machine man, \"a bit of a wide boy,\" Ayckbourn admits admiringly, was intrigued - \"but how do you get the actual money?\" There was no mystery, said the playwright, with his usual anxious modesty, \"the theatre collects a percentage and just sends it to my agent\". The slot-machine man bellowed, \"they just hand over the money? That's fucking brilliant. I have to empty these machines myself, every day. 'Ere, George!\" And Ayckbourn had to describe the whole system to George again. During rehearsals for his 54th and 55th plays, the linked House/Garden, Ayckbourn said: \"Suddenly I've got credibility in Scarborough - for this scam. And I've managed to explain what I am doing there now: I am running an international racket.\" And he laughs, not his guffaw, but his other one - the funny internal sort of gurgle, an almost private sign of some personal satisfaction. It's a revealing tale. In the theatre world Ayckbourn is decisively a man of the people. His friends say he feels it is important to be accepted by ordinary people with ordinary jobs for doing something real. So his plays are designed to be immediately accessible. Nothing matters to him more than getting the audience in. It always has. It was a ground rule imparted by his mentor, Stephen Joseph, after whom Ayckbourn's theatre-in-the-round in Scarborough is named. He was the wild and inspiring son of Michael Joseph the publisher and Hermione Baddeley, the great revue comedienne of the 30s and 40s. Joseph's brief to the then 20-year- old actor was \"to write plays that would fill the theatre\". He's been doing that for 30 years. But Ayckbourn adds now: \"They also had to be worthy of my peers and colleagues who were sharing the dressing room with me in Scarborough. They'd mostly come a long way up from London and made quite big cuts in their living standards to do so. If I'd given them tacky seaside stuff they'd say, 'Look, I could have been doing telly.'\" Ayckbourn is acutely aware of the importance of his adopted home town. The Stephen Joseph Theatre has been his laboratory all his working life. Sir Peter Hall, who vigorously championed him at the National in the mid-80s, describes it as \"a large playroom for him to work out his fantasies and anxieties\". Ayckbourn first went there as an actor aged 18; then in 1970, three years after Joseph died, he became its director. His artistic policy has always been dictated by the need to fill the theatre. But Scarborough isn't London, where there's an audience for anything - for a while, says Ayckbourn. So if he were to do a season of Beckett, he'd probably have to close the theatre down: \"They wouldn't come. There would just be a few from the technical college saying, 'Great. You should do more of this.'\" This determined populism has been the basis for his theatrical credo, combined with the playfulness of his technical craftsmanship, a belief in comedy as a vehicle for his social comment, and his uncanny ability to flirt with the middle classes' sense of themselves - to flay them alive before their eyes and yet have them come back time and again to watch. The milieu of his plays was set very early. Despite having lived in Yorkshire since he was 19, almost all his work is set in the south of England, where he was brought up. He always says that most of his plays are located \"somewhere north of Reading\". They are populated by ruthless little go-getters, philanderers, small men, brave women, bullish opportunists, dreadful do-good ers and, often the only admirable characters, the feckless and the failures. They are all sharply aware of their place in the pecking order and most of them are determined to change it to the disadvantage of others. Men torture their wives emotionally and women go quietly mad through neglect. There is a darkness in his view of human relationships. He watches us inflict awful cruelty on each other, more often than not during the family rituals of birthdays, Christmasses, meals, funerals and marriages. He appears to be deeply pessimistic about the state of relationships between men and women. And in his own tentative way, he's a moralist. He was shocked by the 90s, by what he has called \"all that Thatcherite money-making on everybody else's back, which made us a completely uncaring society\". He told the cast rehearsing the new plays: \"You'll notice in my plays that anyone who mistreats, misbehaves or deceives tends to get their comeuppance. [However] I am probably guilty of tidying up the world a bit because things tend to happen rather quicker in plays than in the real world.

It seeks out new work by writers who wish to reach a wider public, the people Ayckbourn describes as the ones who believe they're not theatregoers. For this the theatre gets \u00a3450,000 a year from Yorkshire Arts, \u00a353,000 from North Yorkshire Council, and \u00a3207,000 from Scarborough Council. Despite the theatre also earning \u00a3650,000 in commercial income, the town has wobbled in its commitment. In 1997 there was the celebrated \"luvvies versus lavvies\" dispute when the redoubtable philistinism of the British reared up in the form of a local councillor who said that the theatre grant would mean closing the town's 22 public lavatories. The headline writers could hardly believe their luck. The local paper was full of inarticulate praise for the public conveniences as a major Scarborough attraction, and Ayckbourn lost his rag. \"If you happen to be teetotal in this town, then God help you - because there is little else to do apart from get drunk and buy shoes,\" he wrote. The council later relented. For all the ongoing debate about the best way of keeping theatre alive, in his book it comes down to one thing: \"I have been out to lunch with successive arts minis ters who say, 'OK, Alan, tell us what the problem is'. And I say, 'money'. And they say 'Apart from that'. It's nothing to do with anything but money. I feel like a man in a house with no roof, the rain pouring in, and people offering money to build a conservatory. I just want some roofing tiles.\" In the town, Ayckbourn retains the affections of a great number of locals. Ian Grundy and Bob Harris, who run the guesthouse, Interludes, whose clients come just to see the plays, say, \"Scarborough can't buy the kind of publicity Alan brings\". They have seen every play and their verdict is that \"he is getting even funnier\". Bob Watson, a retired local English teacher, was a reluctant convert, chaperoning his wife and daughter under protest to his first Ayckbourn, Confusions, in the early 70s. \"I was just staggered,\" he says, starting the kind of knowing commentary on the writing that can only come from an intense involvement in the whole body of work. Ayckbourn is richer than he admits. His agents put the royalties alone at \"well over a million a year\". Ayckbourn says \"a million a year? I wish it was. I work in theatre, you know, I don't do movies.\" But he also gives a lot to his theatre. It is a matter of record that he has worked as artistic director without drawing a salary for 30 years, and that he pays for a casting director. But, according to friends, he also donates a considerable amount of his royalties to the Stephen Joseph and he bought the lease on the current building for an estimated \u00a3200,000, in partnership with Charles McCarthy, the UK chairman of McCain's chips, and Lord Down, both great local supporters of the theatre. Some estimate that his personal contribution to the bid for National Lottery funding which enabled them to buy and open the new building in 1996 was about \u00a3400,000. Ayckbourn is not only part of a great but now-fragile tradition of regional civic theatre, but also of the stream of English dramatists from Shakespeare through the Restoration to the Kitchen Sink, although perhaps not yet including the smack and sodomy kids of Shopping And Fucking and Blasted. But he grew up in theatre's changing landscape. Emerging as an actor just after 1956 when Osborne, Pinter and Wesker were beginning to get established, he also had the advantage of playing Coward and Rattigan in weekly repertory. It is clear that he feels part of both movements but ultimately he decided on a commitment to popular work and to write plays which he says \"are simply about people\". It is that which, out of snobbery, prevents some people taking him seriously.Peter Hall says that there \"is still some feeling that if a play is commercial it somehow doesn't belong in the subsidised theatre and that we should be doing plays about distant indigenous tribes in loose poetic rhyme\". If you want a reputation of significance, that's a fatal error. And it's compounded if you not only choose to write comedies but produce one a year - and then in the provinces. Yet, as a writer in English, Ayckbourn is second only to Shakespeare in terms of the number of times his plays are produced around the world. Every year in Britain there are 25 to 30 professional productions of Ayckbourn, and his work goes around the world, with translations in 34 languages. Later this year the National Theatre of Taiwan in Taipei will revive its hugely successful national tour of Communicating Doors in Cantonese. The German theatre critic Gerhard Stadelmaier called Ayckbourn, whose popularity in Germany almost tops that in Britain, \"the Moli\u00e8re of the middle classes\". Critics, however, are divided about his reputation. Is he just a \"pretty farceur\" - a populist boulevard writer churning out commercial comedy hits based on theatrical trickery, and a writer with no sustainable claim on posterity? Or does a body of work which contains Relatively Speaking, Absurd Person Singular, The Norman Conquests, Absent Friends, Bedroom Farce and A Chorus Of Disapproval, make him \"one of our most serious dramatists, comparable with Pinter, Hare and Stoppard\", as Michael Billington described him? The two new plays are about the deceptive nature of reality; they show people from different angles, so certain things appear funny until you see them from a different perspective. Ayckbourn is reluctant to intellectualise, but will admit that his work has some kind of philosophical impact. But he has a horror that people will draw back from going to his shows if they feel they're going to be preached at. He saw this happen to one of his contemporaries, Harold Pinter, early on in his career. Ayckbourn says, \"to me, he wrote wonderful plays. But they became so studied, so interpreted that you couldn't walk near them without having a BA.\" Analysis clouded the theatrical experience, and even Pinter himself resisted that. In his early days as an actor, Ayckbourn was once directed by Pinter in one of Pinter's own plays. As he was feeling his way into the part, he asked the playwright, \"Where does this guy come from?\" Pinter replied: \"Mind your own fucking business.\" Despite the critics' snobbery it is clear that he is one of the nation's most intuitive chroniclers, particularly foreshadowing what would come to fruition in the 80s with the decline of the professional classes before the advance of thrusting opportunists. As Hall says, \"He has an acute social sense of what it was like to live in England in the last half of the 20th century. And for that, as much as any dramatist, he is required reading\". \u0095 House/Garden open at the National Theatre, Upper Ground, London SE1 on August 9 Life at a glance - Alan Ayckbourn Born: April 12 1939, Hampstead, London Educated: Haileybury, Herts.

If you've got one (Brighton, say, or Torquay), then you're united, and if you've got loads (London), they kind of cancel each other out.

On many a night I was awoken from my childish truckle bed to be carried downstairs to watch the latest victories of the Viet Cong. Thus I grew up unable not to feel strongly about the slightest of Issues, and could be driven to white-knuckle rage by those bovine types who would say, when asked to choose between, for example, spring and autumn, \"Oh, you can't really choose, can you, because it's like comparing apples and oranges.\" But why can't you compare apples and oranges - why can apples be compared only with other apples? </p> <p>By 18, my lack of ability to see the other chap's POV had me marching behind an SWP banner against the National Front and penning vicious pieces in the NME about the rash of nihilist punks, such as Howard Devoto (I know this is getting boring now, but hang on in there), who refused to nail their colours to the mast with self-adoring songs such as Shot By Both Sides. Shot by both sides? As if anyone would bother. </p> <p>My fiercely partisan view of the world lasted until I was well into my thirties. When I was courting my ex-girlfriend, I once broke up with her - though admittedly only for a day - when she refused to agree with me that if Adolf Hitler had lived he should have been put to death. It was an incredibly hedonistic, pleasurable affair, too, so you can imagine how strange and surreal it must have seemed, suddenly interrupting our idyllic sunny afternoon sessions with bouts of interrogation about her preferred method of punishment for the world 's major dead war criminals. </p> <p>But now, in my forties, I actually appear to have started seeing both sides of loads of arguments. Take the proposed repeal on public sex for homosexuals. No one wants to be on the same side as a bunch of joyless Daily Mail curtain-twitchers, but doesn't demanding the right to use public conveniences for one's private pleasure seem rather selfish, almost crypto-Thatcherite? There is no such thing as society, just my own spontaneous sexual fancies. Most of us manage to wait until we get home. Why not gay men? </p> <p>Then there's the euro, and imperial measures. I certainly don't want to live in a world of bland euro-portions, where high streets from Hounslow to Hamburg to the Hague, all look and sound the same, but I can't help thinking that the very people who are asking us to get hot under the collar (measured in inches, natch) about our national identity and sovereignty are the very same people - the Daily Mail again, Mrs T, the Spectator - who have spent the past 50 years crawling so far up the fundament of the US that only the soles of their feet are now visible. It seems highly unlikely that the EU could wreak anything like the havoc on the political, social and cultural life of this country that the US has done, so why all the panic and purity suddenly? </p> <p>Similarly, the sight of the G8 summit, at a cost of \u00a3500 million - including, for some reason, a \u00a34-million replica of Bill Clinton's home in Arkansas - was repellent but, on the other hand, what sort of message about independence and putting their own house in order does it send to the developing world if we keep treating it like a ditzy wife who has run up a huge credit-card bill, pranged the company car and still expects to get away with it scot-free? These countries did, after all, clamour for independence and autonomy, which seems hardly compatible with such indulgence. </p> <p> Then there's economic immigration - and before you get your recycled Biros out, I'm obviously not referring to people who flee in fear for their lives, but rather to those people who come here in pursuit of a better lifestyle. No one wants to see people dying in the backs of vans - but what is the long-term effect on the already weak developing world if its fittest, brightest and most able people are welcomed into the west as yet more fodder for our many-mawed corporate monster? Surely it would be far better for everyone if those people with skills stayed at home and used them for the betterment of their own struggling countries. </p> <p>Yet I know that, if I was one of these same people, I would be over here like a shot. This is, after all is said and done, the best country out of a bad bunch, and I would certainly never want to live anywhere else. So it seems a bit phoney of me to be against any sort of immigration. (Just as phoney, in fact, as those knee-jerk liberals who are always running England down, but then, when it comes to immigration, seem to change their minds completely and maintain that a man's life isn't worth living unless he can live it on this sceptred Isle.) </p> <p>The immediate effect on my day-to-day life of seeing both sides of an argument is that I feel a good deal more relaxed and tranquil, but also, if the truth be told, only half alive. That's not to say I'm not happier. It's just that I do miss the adrenaline rush that fierce, blinding hatred of the other side invariably provided, and I'm sure that's why a lot of people go in for hate on a regular basis. Hate, like love, stirs up certain pleasurable chemicals in us that become addictive. Meanwhile, I'm going to kick back and enjoy the summer scraps from my vantage point, and dream of the day when I'm back in the fray once more.</p>",

She spoke her mind: \"You should be ashamed if you think you've got something to celebrate!\" Life at the Platts is like sitting between the cymbals during one of Beethoven's noisier bits, and this set them off fortissimo: \"We'll have something else to celebrate soon when you go!\" Pausing only to chew the vicar's ear (\"You're not fit to wear that dog collar!\"), Candice's mother left in a marked manner. Just as the missing godfather arrived in a police car, having been caught shoplifting. Talking of godfather... in Coronation Street a huge and hairy passenger squeezed into Steve McDonald's minicab, addressed him affably as \"Sunshine\" and threatened him with an early death if he testified in court. Homicidal yetis may be par for the course when minicabbing, but the whiskery one added one riveting word. \" Capice? \" Capice? In Coronation Street? I haven't felt so shaken since an Italian nurse produced a syringe and said her name was Borgia.",

      "body": "<p>We have come to Lisbon to check out a portrait painted more than five centuries ago whose \"likeness\" perhaps still applies, still rings true. A portrait of the city itself in six panels. </p> <p>After the customs at the airport, we spot, amongst all the people who have come to meet travellers they don't know and so are holding up names written on pieces of cardboard, a man who is in the painting. His name has long since been forgotten, yet he's easy for us to recognise because he looks like Pasolini. His face has the same expression of desire and foreboding. In the painting he's standing at the very top of the fourth panel. At the airport he notices us - he misses very little - yet he makes no sign. The simple fact of his being there was the sign. He had come to reassure us, who had travelled so far, that the others, his companions, were awaiting us. </p> <p>The painting, with its six wooden panels, shows the dignitaries and people of Lisbon revering their patron saint, Vincent. The people are life-size. It was painted in the 1460s by Nuno Gon\u00e7alves for the cathedral. Then it was lost, and refound in 1882 in the monastery of S\u00e3o Vincente de Fora. Today it is in the Museum of Antique Art. </p> <p>We go to the church of S\u00e3o Vincente de Fora on Palm Sunday. A small crowd of elderly women with their grandchildren, carrying bouquets of reeds, laurel, rosemary, carnations, are waiting to be blessed. Standing by the high altar before he says Mass, the young priest - he has almost the air of an adolescent - takes off his glasses and carefully, between finger and thumb, cleans them on his crimson robe. When he places them back on his nose, he can see very clearly and he surveys the congregation without either harshness or indulgence, without pathos or rhetoric. Could it be that an unwritten city law here is: do not exaggerate, for life itself is already exaggerated? The painting seems to propose this, but we do not yet know why. </p> <p>A young woman modulating her voice so that it suggests, in the immense church, the horizon outside, sings an oratorio as if it were a fado . It is often said that Lisbon is the city of la saudade , which is usually translated as nostalgia, and that fados are the popular songs of this mood. </p> <p>There would be good reasons here for being nostalgic. In the 15th century, having opened up the trade routes to west Africa, India, China and Brazil, Lisbon was one of the richest capitals in Europe, importing diamonds, gold and spices. An example: 120 tons of cloves per annum! </p> <p>Walking along a narrow street of the Alfama district in a squall of Atlantic rain, we came upon a pungent smell of cinnamon and red pepper: the last traces of a past wealth left in poor dishes. </p> <p>In the same narrow street we enter a small cafe, the size of a caravan, where we drink beer and are offered beans to nibble. Besides the two of us, there are five men who are clearly habitu\u00e9s. One of them, a widower in his 70s, is telling stories about life's exaggerations. He is wearing a new flat cap on the very top of his head, which underlines the worn-ness of his face. He is called Sebastiao. In the painting he's a bishop - just below Pasolini - and there in the painting he doubts whether his long homilies have ever been believed, and this doubt constitutes the sadness of his sincerity. </p> <p>Lisbon was once a city of great navigators, over-armed crusaders, unsparing merchants, wealthy slave-traders - 16th century records show that, during just three years, some 400,000 souls suffered, in Portuguese boats, the \"Middle Crossing\" from West Africa to Brazil. In 1775, Lisbon was destroyed by tidal waves and an earthquake which continued for days. Experts calculate that another earthquake is overdue. </p> <p>Nevertheless, nostalgia is the wrong word. Vienna is, par excellence, the city of a nostalgia for past glory. And its nostalgia is suffocating. Lisbon is buffeted by too many winds. </p> <p>On a traffic island near the Garden of The Martyrs we each place a lit candle in a makeshift metal tent, the size of a baby's pram, where 100 or more other candles touch each other as they flicker and burn, protected as they are from the wind. A city as tilted and open towards an ocean as this one cannot be nostalgic. Lisbon is, however, the most westerly city of the continent, and so the nearest to the sunset. </p> <p>The western Atlantic coasts of Europe, from the highlands in Scotland, passing by Donegal in Ireland, Land's End in England, Brittany in France, Galicia in Spain, all speak of and evoke dreams about a departure westwards and about the millions who departed - of whom the sunset is a reminder every evening of the departed, who were lost at sea, or who discovered new continents of experience. </p> <p>Remembering the past in the present tense, yes; nostalgia, no. This is a fine distinction, yet in portraits, fine distinctions are crucial. Of course, there's no tilted city to be seen in the painting. There are simply 58 people standing in a kind of Flemish painted portrait-box. (Van Eyck, who influenced Goncalves, visited Lisbon in the 1420s). The martyr St Vincent, who is in the foreground, is represented twice. A few of those who are honouring him have been identified: the King Alfonso V, his uncle Henry the Navigator, who set up a school for mariners and invented a compass, the archbishop. The others - fishermen with their nets, monks, a doctor, an architect, a Jew, a scribe, the ambitious and the modest of every kind, all 50 of them have become anonymous. Each face is highly individual, yet they share something. And what the 50 faces have in common, what perhaps makes them a single city, is a certain stance towards life. How to get close to examine that stance? </p> <p>We are in one of the famous yellow trams - they are as famous as San Francisco's cable cars, for they have been much filmed during recent years. Maybe with A Streetcar Named Desire, they are the only other trams which have become stars. </p> <p>The drivers drive like sailors, as if all the while they were hauling ropes and tying knots rather than operating wheels and levers. Behind the driver, the passengers sit or stand - many of them are women (unfortunately, there are no ordinary women in the painting) with a familial calm, as if they were each sitting at home or standing on their own landing. </p> <p>Herculano, young and from the country, is standing beside the driver; he works on a cork plantation undressing the trunks of oak trees; already he accepts what he's going to get in life. So much and no more. In the painting he's in the top row, third from the right. </p> <p>This tram is a room running on rails between other rooms. It climbs, shudders, turns on a staircase, goes downstairs, makes a noise like a knife being sharpened in the kitchen, waits, starts again, passing between shops, doorways, bedrooms, living rooms with TVs, birdcages, a dog with his paws on the windowsill, closets which have been locked for years with the key lost, and all the while, as it lurches on its journey, it almost touches the first-storey open windows or the street doors - leaving in the street only enough space for those who know how to flatten themselves suddenly against a wall. Could it be that this capacity of flattening oneself, even when fat, has something to do with the stance we are trying to get close to? Portugal, too, is a narrow country flattened between the mass of Europe and the ocean. </p> <p>We return to the painting and its unusual perspective. It plays like the city does, the city with its seven steep hills, its three funiculars, its steps, its little cast iron tower of Santa Justa, owned by the tramway company, where the lift just takes people up and down: it plays with eye levels. In the foreground, you look steeply down on the painted parquet floor on which 10 figures are kneeling. And when you look at all the citizens standing in the two back rows with their faces just as large as those in the foreground, you are looking up at them from way below. What is unusual is that, although these citizens are purported to be standing further away on the same floor as the chief protagonists, they seem to be standing, flattened against a wall, on a balcony which protrudes forwards. </p> <p>They are, as it were, upstairs overlooking everything which is not in the picture, and no two are looking in the same direction. Standing on their narrow ledge of Portugal and, taking one thing at a time, they appear to be contemplating everything without a trace of rhetoric or exaggeration. </p> <p>In a poem about his own life, seen after his own death, Fernando Pessoa wrote: </p> <p> I understood that things are real and all <br> different from each other; <br> I understood it with the eyes, never with thinking. </p> <p>In the Baixa district, where Pessoa worked in a bank, a long-distance race is taking place. The circuit goes repeatedly around several blocks of smart shops, banks, travel agencies. The trams and traffic have to wait or stop. Nobody shows the slightest impatience. One thing at a time on this Sunday morning. </p> <p>There are several hundred runners, including a few women. Many of the men are over 50. They run well, steadily, encouraging one another, their long strides beating out a rhythm on the cobbles between the tramlines on the streets. </p> <p>No bravura. No overt competitiveness. It is already for all the runners a victory rather than a race. We notice a face stretched by effort into a kind of smile which acknowledges his own name, Costa, and everything that has and is happening to Costa! Then we see a similar smile on the faces of Madalena, Joachim, Luiz. </p> <p>This is not a city which fucks itself up. No, it's a city that waits, knowing that the brief moment to fuck will come. </p> <p>A young man in the fifth panel - he may be the Marquis of Montenor - is probably thinking about death. </p> <p>We take a tram to the Cemetery of Pleasures. The sign indicating the tram's destination is simply Prazeres (Pleasures). Like almost every site in Lisbon, the cemetery is on a hill. The graveyard streets are lined with tall cypresses. The tombs, called jazigos (lying-in places) are little stone residences. A typical jazigo has a metal door with two windows and lace curtains inside. We peer through the lace and see on either side of the door three tiers for coffins with counterpanes, rugs, photos, pillows, flowers, a Madonna, a teddy bear, a toy tram. In one there may have been an empty birdcage. What we cannot see is whether the doors have handles on the inside. </p> <p>The man in the office by the cemetery gate has the face of a sailor. Come to think of it, the jazigos are the size of small ship's cabins. In response to a visitor's question he is bent over a map. Like many calm people, he has a strong neck. We recognise him: second row from the top in the second panel - a fisherman at that time. </p> <p>Now we are in the Pra\u00e7a da Allegria, the Square of Joy. A small public garden with elms, palms and jacaranda trees. On the grass chickens peck for worms. There is a flowery plaque celebrating Alfredo Keill, who wrote the Portuguese national anthem. An old woman with an umbrella is sitting very still on a park bench. We think she's watching one of the chickens. Then she gets to her feet, turns, and walks, using her umbrella as a stick, towards us. As she walks she laughs. She stops in front of us, still smiling. </p> <p>There's something you shouldn't forget, she says, in fact you should know it, and it's this: the dead don't stay where they are buried. </p> <p>We nod. </p> <p>I have to go now to watch the sunset, like I do every evening, she adds. </p> <p>We follow her at a distance up the hill. </p> <p>Lisbon is a city which forgives many of life's cruelties. </p> <p>Remembering the past, it perhaps displays a certain indulgence. Remembering it for a second time, it regains control of itself. Remembering the past for a third time, it waits to see what is going to happen next.</p>",

It plays like the city does, the city with its seven steep hills, its three funiculars, its steps, its little cast iron tower of Santa Justa, owned by the tramway company, where the lift just takes people up and down: it plays with eye levels. In the foreground, you look steeply down on the painted parquet floor on which 10 figures are kneeling. And when you look at all the citizens standing in the two back rows with their faces just as large as those in the foreground, you are looking up at them from way below. What is unusual is that, although these citizens are purported to be standing further away on the same floor as the chief protagonists, they seem to be standing, flattened against a wall, on a balcony which protrudes forwards. They are, as it were, upstairs overlooking everything which is not in the picture, and no two are looking in the same direction. Standing on their narrow ledge of Portugal and, taking one thing at a time, they appear to be contemplating everything without a trace of rhetoric or exaggeration. In a poem about his own life, seen after his own death, Fernando Pessoa wrote: I understood that things are real and all different from each other; I understood it with the eyes, never with thinking. In the Baixa district, where Pessoa worked in a bank, a long-distance race is taking place. The circuit goes repeatedly around several blocks of smart shops, banks, travel agencies. The trams and traffic have to wait or stop. Nobody shows the slightest impatience. One thing at a time on this Sunday morning. There are several hundred runners, including a few women. Many of the men are over 50. They run well, steadily, encouraging one another, their long strides beating out a rhythm on the cobbles between the tramlines on the streets. No bravura. No overt competitiveness. It is already for all the runners a victory rather than a race. We notice a face stretched by effort into a kind of smile which acknowledges his own name, Costa, and everything that has and is happening to Costa! Then we see a similar smile on the faces of Madalena, Joachim, Luiz. This is not a city which fucks itself up. No, it's a city that waits, knowing that the brief moment to fuck will come. A young man in the fifth panel - he may be the Marquis of Montenor - is probably thinking about death. We take a tram to the Cemetery of Pleasures. The sign indicating the tram's destination is simply Prazeres (Pleasures). Like almost every site in Lisbon, the cemetery is on a hill. The graveyard streets are lined with tall cypresses. The tombs, called jazigos (lying-in places) are little stone residences. A typical jazigo has a metal door with two windows and lace curtains inside. We peer through the lace and see on either side of the door three tiers for coffins with counterpanes, rugs, photos, pillows, flowers, a Madonna, a teddy bear, a toy tram. In one there may have been an empty birdcage. What we cannot see is whether the doors have handles on the inside. The man in the office by the cemetery gate has the face of a sailor. Come to think of it, the jazigos are the size of small ship's cabins. In response to a visitor's question he is bent over a map. Like many calm people, he has a strong neck. We recognise him: second row from the top in the second panel - a fisherman at that time. Now we are in the Pra\u00e7a da Allegria, the Square of Joy. A small public garden with elms, palms and jacaranda trees. On the grass chickens peck for worms. There is a flowery plaque celebrating Alfredo Keill, who wrote the Portuguese national anthem. An old woman with an umbrella is sitting very still on a park bench. We think she's watching one of the chickens. Then she gets to her feet, turns, and walks, using her umbrella as a stick, towards us. As she walks she laughs. She stops in front of us, still smiling. There's something you shouldn't forget, she says, in fact you should know it, and it's this: the dead don't stay where they are buried. We nod. I have to go now to watch the sunset, like I do every evening, she adds. We follow her at a distance up the hill. Lisbon is a city which forgives many of life's cruelties. Remembering the past, it perhaps displays a certain indulgence. Remembering it for a second time, it regains control of itself. Remembering the past for a third time, it waits to see what is going to happen next.",

      "body": "<p>When I reached the age of 60 at the beginning of the year, I didn't feel that this was a great event. Insofar as the passing of the decades has made any impression on me at all, I think that the most unsettling moment was when I turned 30. It meant that my youth had gone forever and that I couldn't pretend otherwise. Turning 40 obviously meant that I could no longer deny middle age, but I wasn't trying to deny it, anyway, so that didn't bother me. And as people live longer and longer (eg, the Queen Mother who, as you may have heard, was 100 years old yesterday), middle age has expanded to occupy a huge chunk of one's life. </p> <p>So I turned 50 and then 60 without thinking there had been any change in my enduring status as a middle-aged man. It did not occur to me that I might have become old, and although I am now possibly less agile and more forgetful than I used to be, and although my hair is practically white and my digestive system less efficient, the thought still does not occur to me. Or at least it would not occur to me if the Government were not so determined to convince me that I have in fact passed through some age barrier from which there is no turning back. </p> <p>Since becoming 60, although I now work harder and earn more money than I have ever done before, I have already been offered cheap rail travel and cheap winter fuel in recognition of my age and frailty. Worse than that, when I got to the front of a queue to buy an entrance ticket to the Natural History Museum the other day, I was waved away on the grounds that I looked too old to have to pay for one. That was hurtful, but it also made me wonder why the Natural History Museum felt it shouldn't ask people over 60 to buy a ticket even though it clearly needs their money. </p> <p>The nation is supposedly facing a crisis caused by an impending glut of old people. There will be too few people in work to pay for the welfare of those in retirement, it is claimed. Radical action is required to deal with this impending disaster. Yet the Government, instead of exploiting the yearning of 60-year-olds to be thought of as vigorous and self-sufficient by telling them to brace up and get on their bikes, urges them to think of themselves as old and helpless and in need of financial support. This is complete madness on the Government's part. </p> <p>The crisis has been exacerbated by the ageism that has taken root in our society over the past few decades. Most companies and public bodies now insist that employees should retire at 65, if not earlier, however well they are doing their jobs. Even the Pope, who is allowed to carry on until he dies, demands that his bishops offer him their resignations when they are 75. Why should it matter how old a bishop is? The older, the better, I would have thought. </p> <p>As a freelance journalist, I have a very inadequate pension provision, and this has begun to worry me. Last week I went to my bank to consult a pensions expert about this. Was there still anything I could do to avoid destitution in my old age? In response, she kept asking me a disconcerting and unanswerable question: \"When do you want to retire?\" I could reply only that I had no idea. I suppose I will go on writing for newspapers as long as I feel able to do so, and as long as there remains a newspaper that is prepared to print what I write. I will also presumably write less, and therefore earn less, as I get older and lazier. Like the Queen Mother, I will probably cut down my commitments a bit when I get to 100, but, like her, too, I don't suppose I will exactly retire. </p> <p> All this brings me to Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester. At the age of 98, she has just become the first member of the Royal Family in this nation's history formally to retire. The announcement was made this week by her son, the Duke of Gloucester, who offered good reasons for her decision. </p> <p>She had, he said, \"become increasingly forgetful, which greatly reduces her ability to communicate in the way she would wish\", he said. \"For this reason, my mother no longer feels confident in carrying out official engagements away from Kensington Palace or in coping with the clamour of social gatherings.\" In practice, this will not make a great difference to anything. Princess Alice's last official engagement outside her home was a visit in 1995 to the Ladies' Guild of the St John Ophthalmic Hospital. But she has set a disturbing precedent.</p>",

I continued to sip the decent drop of stuff that he was generously providing, a Barolo, but when the bottle was exhausted I ventured the view that I infinitely preferred sitting through The Pirates Of Penzance to enduring Parsifal and he looked disgusted. He didn't open a second bottle. </p> <p>It is true, of course, that red wine is deeper and richer than white, since it uses the skins of the grapes for colour and chemical extraction (most important, the tannins), whereas white only flirts with the skins. But, in spite of this, I still regard riesling as great a grape as any red, apart from syrah and nebbiolo. Chardonnay, too, can achieve startling levels of dramatic intrigue, in the form it sometimes achieves in California, Australia, Chile and, uniquely (but rarely), in Burgundy. </p> <p>All this is by way of introducing this week's column, which is exclusively white. Let us open with Argento Chardonnay 1999, from Argentina. It packs in melons, ripe pineapples, pears, raisins and delicate acids to great effect. Fine, frolicsome, cheap and so cheerfully complex that you smile as you sip - and it is a sipping wine, such is its provocative, if soft, style. You can find it at Tesco, though not all branches (call 0800 505555 for details), it costs \u00a34.99 and rates 17 points out of 20. </p> <p>At Bottoms Up and Wine Rack, there are a pair of exquisite 17-point New Zealanders. Te Mata Estate Chardonnay 1999 (\u00a38.49) has the old-fashioned vegetality of the Montrachet variety and the limpid acids of the Kiwi kind. The marriage is superb: angular, classy, finely wrought and outstandingly, compactly balanced. Church Road Reserve Chardonnay 1998 (\u00a311.99) delivers extreme elegance and controlled fruitiness, which impact on the tastebuds subtly yet thrillingly, then the marvellous texture becomes apparent, then the rich, dramatic finish. </p> <p>Thresher and Victoria Wine also boast two 17-point Kiwis. Montana Reserve Chardonnay 1999 (\u00a37.99) is intense yet sublime, offering creamily rich fruit that manages to come across potently without being too ripe or blatant. A delicious blend of smoky melon and fine acids, it has elegance, elongation, and ease of effect. With Church Road Chardonnay 1998 (\u00a38.99), there is an old European undertow to the fruit, fine and agricultural, but, in its overall polish and aplomb, it is on another planet from many of the three-times-more-expensive white burgundies with which we might odorously compare it. </p> <p>Thresher and Victoria Wine (along with Majestic and certain Safeway branches - 01622 712926 for details) also have two further NZ wines, both rating 16.5 points. 'In the Black' Chardonnay 1998 (\u00a35.99) presents a wonderful clash of baked melon/pineapple with fresh lemon acids. Oyster Bay Chardonnay 1999 (\u00a36.99) is sleekly fruity, with an almost lazy manner to it, exposing layers of supple fruit and crisp acids. </p> <p>Last at Thresher and Victoria Wine, a superb Soave: Zenato Soave Classico 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99) is possibly the classiest specimen of its kind - rich, controlled, stylishly acidic, beautifully textured, very finely wrought, and remarkably stylish and subtle. </p> <p>At Unwins, there is a quartet of attractive whites, two from Australia, two from Chile. The latter are Valdivieso Chardonnay 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99) and Concha y Toro Gew\u00fcrztraminer 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.49). The chardonnay parades gorgeously chewable fruit, all vegetal and ripe but bold and polished on the finish. </p> <p>The gew\u00fcrz has the clich\u00e9d spicy richness and rosy-edged fruit, but also something extra, more exotic and slightly rogueish on the finish. This is a terrific wine for oriental nosh. The Aussies are Woodvale Semillon/ Chardonnay 1999 (15 points, \u00a33.99), which is a bargain bowl of understated, never OTT, fruit; and Grant Burge Late Harvest Muscat 1997 (16 points, \u00a34.99), which is menthol-undertoned, pineappley, very rich and half-sweet. It makes a wholly different aperitif, and works with rich Chinese food such as duck pancakes with plum sauce.</p>",

The latter are Valdivieso Chardonnay 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99) and Concha y Toro Gew\u00fcrztraminer 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.49). The chardonnay parades gorgeously chewable fruit, all vegetal and ripe but bold and polished on the finish. The gew\u00fcrz has the clich\u00e9d spicy richness and rosy-edged fruit, but also something extra, more exotic and slightly rogueish on the finish. This is a terrific wine for oriental nosh. The Aussies are Woodvale Semillon/ Chardonnay 1999 (15 points, \u00a33.99), which is a bargain bowl of understated, never OTT, fruit; and Grant Burge Late Harvest Muscat 1997 (16 points, \u00a34.99), which is menthol-undertoned, pineappley, very rich and half-sweet. It makes a wholly different aperitif, and works with rich Chinese food such as duck pancakes with plum sauce.",

It was a really horrible presence. When I moved, I felt that I took that energy with me to the next flat.\"</p> <p>So, when Khushbir bought her first two-bedroom house four years ago, in Stratford, east London, she \"was keen to have it cleansed of any negative energy\".</p> <p>Khushbir, who is a Sikh, claims not to be religious, more \"spiritual\". She was keen in this instance to seek advice from an older Hindu for an appropriate ceremony, and so she turned to her friend, Neeta.

Later, you're supposed to move [the offerings] up into the attic, but I can't get to mine, so I place the tray on top of my cupboard.\"</p> <p>As a precautionary measure, to ward off any undesirable intentions or karma that may be brought to the house by visitors, fresh chillies and limes are threaded together and hung on the front doorway. Statues of Hindu gods live both in the kitchen and the bedroom. \"I don't believe in coincidences,\" says Khushbir, \"but I've never had that nightmare in this house.\"</p> <p>While Khushbir's ceremony was a one-off, a blessing - or Ayiasmo - is a regular affair for Greek Orthodox care worker, Elena Sideri-Costa. \"I first got the house blessed a week after I moved in,\" says Elena, 49, who lives in Palmers Green, north London. \"I invited the local priest, family and friends,\" she says. \"The priest bought an icon, and we lit candles and burnt frankincense. We prayed together for about 20 minutes and then the priest sprinkled holy water with basil leaves around the house - the purpose being that, if there are any bad omens or any kind of evil, it will go away. It's a new start, a new life, a clean start in a new house.</p> <p>\"It's not just a blessing for when you buy a house - sometimes people do it every year, or if there has been any bad fortune in their lives. If ever I feel a bit down, I will call my local priest and get an Ayiasmo performed. So far, I have had it done every couple of years.\"</p> <p>Ayiasmos are followed by a celebration. Dancing is a must. \"After your house has been full of family and friends of all ages all having a wonderful time, the house feels lighter and better,\" says Elena. That is what I like most about them: it is a way of getting a whole community together.\"</p> <p>Throughout her house, there is an abundance of silver- and gold-plated religious icons. The front living room is a haven in which a corner is devoted to prayer and ritual. One entire corner of the room is filled with pictures of Saint Constantine, Mary, Jesus and Saint Helena that have been passed down through the family.</p> <p>As she prays, Elena regularly burns frankincense, and olive leaves and oil. \"We believe that the olive tree is holy, because Jesus used to rest under them. We believe that with the rising smoke our prayers reach the heavens.\"</p> <p>While Elena displays icons and religious pictures around her home, Flora Michael, 98, who lives in a Jewish Care residential home, keeps a Mezuzah on her bedroom door. This is a piece of parchment with Hebrew passages from Deuteronomy written on it, and should be put up by a boy over the age of 13 (regarded as an adult) or a rabbi within 30 days of moving into a house.

      "body": "<p>It was a perfect pudding, without unholy embellishment of any kind: a small cloud of pavlova with three spoonfuls of intensely-flavoured sorbets - raspberry, blackcurrant and redcurrant - each finished with a flick of barely whipped cream. The sorbets were of a perfect consistency, having that slight density they get an hour or so after churning that adds substance to the clear, penetrating flavour of the fruit. The pavlova was crisp without, like the crust on a fall of snow, giving way to a soft and yielding froth below. The comma of cream provided a gentle foil. It was simple, beautiful, magical.</p> <p>That elegant construct of a pudding - half Phillip Johnson, half Philippe Starck - at Campanile, the hot-shot restaurant on La Brea, Los Angeles, was an epiphany in my experience of ices, a landmark in the memory bank, and one to set beside the soothing balm of the fig, peach and almond combo in Florence that I wrote about last week.</p> <p>In this day of the super-rich, artery-clogging, commercial ice cream, the lighter, subtler, more intense pleasures of the sorbet tend to get passed over, yet their history is longer and, if anything, richer than that of its cream and egg yolk brother. Tradition has it that the Chinese and Arabs started it all off when they used snow to chill fruit juices, and for once there might be some substance to tradition.

Churn the sorbet mix, then transfer to the chilled bowl in the freezer</p> <p><b> TECHNICAL TIPS</b><br> \u0095 Sorbets can be made with either fruit pur\u00e9e and syrup or fruit pur\u00e9e, syrup and raw egg white. Eggs whites are added to stabilise those sorbets that melt rather quickly, or to lighten those that tend to go rather dense because there is not enough pectin or fibre in the fruit used. If you do use egg whites, get pasteurised ones, if you can; otherwise, use only very fresh, free-range, organic eggs.</p> <p>\u0095 It is worth keeping a jar or bottle of syrup in the fridge during the peak sorbet season, so that you can easily make them fresh every day or so. The syrup will keep happily in the fridge for up to two weeks.</p> <p>\u0095 The ratio of sugar to water required to make the classic simple syrup is 1:1 (ie, 500g sugar + 500ml water = 800ml syrup; or 1kg sugar + 1 litre water = 1,600ml syrup).</p> <p>\u0095 You can use granulated or caster sugar. Just heat until the sugar crystals are melted, cool and then pour into a sterilised container. You can make syrup simply by mixing sugar and water. This takes longer, so it is advisable here to use the finer caster sugar, which dissolves easier.</p> <p>\u0095 You can make sorbets without an ice-cream machine or sorbeti\u00e8re. Just decant your sorbet mixture into a plastic container and palce it in the coldest part of the freezer. Check it after 1-1 hours - there should be a rim of ice crystals forming round the edge of the containers with soft slush in the middle. Beat for a few seconds with a whisk, electric beater or in a food processor, until you have a uniform slush, and put the container back in the freezer. Do this a couple more times at 1-1 hour intervals until the right texture is reached.</p> <p>\u0095 Sorbets that contain alcohol take longer to freeze.</p> <p>\u0095 Sorbets are best eaten within a few hours of being made. They will keep in the freezer indefinitely, but the freshness of flavour soon goes, so it is better to make them in small quantities and often.</p> <p>Jeremy Lee is chef at Blue Print Cafe, London SE1.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was a perfect pudding, without unholy embellishment of any kind: a small cloud of pavlova with three spoonfuls of intensely-flavoured sorbets - raspberry, blackcurrant and redcurrant - each finished with a flick of barely whipped cream. The sorbets were of a perfect consistency, having that slight density they get an hour or so after churning that adds substance to the clear, penetrating flavour of the fruit. The pavlova was crisp without, like the crust on a fall of snow, giving way to a soft and yielding froth below. The comma of cream provided a gentle foil. It was simple, beautiful, magical. That elegant construct of a pudding - half Phillip Johnson, half Philippe Starck - at Campanile, the hot-shot restaurant on La Brea, Los Angeles, was an epiphany in my experience of ices, a landmark in the memory bank, and one to set beside the soothing balm of the fig, peach and almond combo in Florence that I wrote about last week. In this day of the super-rich, artery-clogging, commercial ice cream, the lighter, subtler, more intense pleasures of the sorbet tend to get passed over, yet their history is longer and, if anything, richer than that of its cream and egg yolk brother. Tradition has it that the Chinese and Arabs started it all off when they used snow to chill fruit juices, and for once there might be some substance to tradition. According to students of ice history, the first mention of what is known as endothermic effect, using saltpetre and cold water to make ice, comes in the Kitab Uyan al-Anba fi Tabaqat al-Atibba, by Ibn Abu Usaybi, an Arab medical historian in the 13th century. There are serious technical differences between sherbet, deriving from the Arabic sharbat - \"syrups, pastes, powders, lemonades and other fruit juices, sweetened and diluted with water in the Turkish fashion, and regarded primarily as healthful, sustaining, restorative beverages\", as the peerless Elizabeth David puts it, which were sometimes mixed with snow or ice - and sorbet, which derives from the Italian sorbire, meaning \"to sip\". When sorbet became the frozen ice that we know and love today, however, is a bit confused, to say the least. There has been a long-standing connection based on trade and conquest (not necessarily in that order) between Sicily and North Africa, and between North Africa, Sicily and southern Italy, and it seems likely that this is how knowledge of these most desirable summer coolers percolated ever northwards. There are establishments in Messina, Palermo and various other Sicilian towns that specialise in one of the three great branches of ice science to this day. Although water ices - aka eaux glac\u00e9s, eaux d'Italie or acque gelate - were known and appreciated in Paris, Naples, Florence and Spain in the 1660s, it was only when a Sicilian, Francisco Procopio, opened the Cafe Procope in Paris to sell sorbets and sherbets in or around 1690 that they really took off.

They had conceded 275 runs and taken 24 wickets at 11.45 runs apiece.<br></p> <p>The other West Indian bowlers had sent down 90.1 overs and England had scored 325 off them, with only 21 maidens produced and 12 wickets taken at a cost of 27.08 runs per wicket.<br></p> <p>That pattern repeated itself on day two here, with Walsh and Ambrose continuing in their parsimonious mode. Ambrose was containing but Walsh once again also found the inspiration to summon up that penetrative edge needed to pick up three wickets. It took his tally to 470 as he continues to improve his own record, and at one stage he had bowled seven consecutive overs and taken three wickets without conceding a run.<br></p> <p>It was another display of high-quality bowling from the 37-year-old Jamaican. That he was able to summon up his enthusiasm and this type of performance in his 120th Test was no simple achievement. Could this be due to the obvious delight he still finds in playing? This was evident after he had taken his third wicket, Graham Thorpe, after which he grinned from ear to ear and almost danced into a celebratory huddle with team-mates.<br></p> <p>Should he play the remaining matches here he will surpass Sir Vivian Richards as the West Indian who has played the most Tests. It is another record to add to his most wickets, most ducks and most not-outs.

      "bodyText": "Prior to this third Test, Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose had bowled 152 overs in the series against England, of which 65 were maidens. They had conceded 275 runs and taken 24 wickets at 11.45 runs apiece. The other West Indian bowlers had sent down 90.1 overs and England had scored 325 off them, with only 21 maidens produced and 12 wickets taken at a cost of 27.08 runs per wicket. That pattern repeated itself on day two here, with Walsh and Ambrose continuing in their parsimonious mode. Ambrose was containing but Walsh once again also found the inspiration to summon up that penetrative edge needed to pick up three wickets. It took his tally to 470 as he continues to improve his own record, and at one stage he had bowled seven consecutive overs and taken three wickets without conceding a run. It was another display of high-quality bowling from the 37-year-old Jamaican. That he was able to summon up his enthusiasm and this type of performance in his 120th Test was no simple achievement. Could this be due to the obvious delight he still finds in playing? This was evident after he had taken his third wicket, Graham Thorpe, after which he grinned from ear to ear and almost danced into a celebratory huddle with team-mates. Should he play the remaining matches here he will surpass Sir Vivian Richards as the West Indian who has played the most Tests. It is another record to add to his most wickets, most ducks and most not-outs. He must qualify for most effort as well, even if this is a joint award with those other players who have always given their all. There has been much discussion on whether Walsh can go on long enough to get 500 Test wickets. On this proof of his continued excellence, why not? There is certainly no one waiting in the wings to challenge his position. It must be a reflection on West Indian cricket that no one is challenging him and must be one of the greatest concerns, along with the brittle nature of the batting and yesterday's indifferent fielding. It will also be of concern to Walsh, because he is a team man. This is a depressing period for West Indies on this tour but nothing can detract from Walsh's contribution. He may be a team man but one must suspect that his decision to continue may well hinge on the output of his present colleagues and his ability to bear the load.",

Their captain, John Crawley, is their only opening batsman here, and he would really prefer to bat at No3. Yesterday they opened with Crawley and the fast bowler Glen Chapple. Their coach Bobby Simpson said: \"The balance of the team meant we needed a fourth seamer. Chapple has a good technique and a lot of courage and has scored runs as nightwatchman.\" Chapple did manage to survive his opening partner in the first innings. Crawley was lbw, shuffling forward to Martin Bicknell, with only five scored. In the next over Chapple was caught by Mark Butcher to give Tudor his first wicket. And Lancashire were seven for three when Sourav Ganguly trod on his stumps from his first delivery. It got worse. Neil Fairbrother hung out his bat and was caught at second slip at 33 and without addition Graham Lloyd was caught behind. Lancashire were relying on Andrew Flintoff, who looked in the sort of form that brought him a violent and unbeaten 135 in that NatWest game. But he was sixth out with the score on 85 when he was caught at forward short-leg off Saqlain Mushtaq and Lancashire's serious resistance was over. Tudor has bowled faster but rarely straighter. He had Chris Schofield caught at mid-on, Gary Keedy caught at fourth slip and bowled Warren Hegg. When Surrey batted again Mark Butcher appeared to be back to is best with a well-timed 95 from 134 deliveries. But it was a blow from Alistair Brown, one of the biggest sixes seen here, that will be remembered. He dove Schofield straight on to the balcony of the pavilion's broadcasting box, about 70 feet up.",

Alec Stewart, in his 100th Test match, glorified the occasion with a century of bristling brilliance that wrenched back the initiative seized by West Indies as Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose sought to rectify the damage done to their chances in the third Test by the ineptness of their batsmen. </p> <p>It was 6.15, and gloomy, when Stewart poked the single on the offside that took him to his 14th Test century and his first against West Indies in this country. As he completed the run he gave a joyous leap, punched the air, and then saluted all corners of the ground. The crowd responded by giving him the sort of lengthy standing ovation usually accorded leaders at party conferences, only this was given with genuine spontaneity. </p> <p>In a bygone era, hats would have been thrown in the air and never retrieved. Of the 21 previous players who have reached 100 Tests, only three - Colin Cowdrey, Javed Miandad and Gordon Greenidge - marked the occasion with a century. He joins an exclusive section of an already exclusive club. </p> <p>This was a remarkable effort, as fine an innings as Stewart can ever have played and on the back of a rich international sequence of 101, 100 not out and 97 in the recent one-day series. It has helped place England, 39 runs ahead with seven first-innings wickets in hand, in a strong position in this vital Test. </p> <p>In on a hat-trick, he was eight not out at tea. But by the close he had reached 105, adding 97 in a long session of 36 overs, during which time he and young Marcus Trescothick, playing his debut Test innings, added 149. </p> <p>Thus far the pair have added 179 for the fourth wicket, the highest partnership for any wicket against West Indies on this ground with Trescothick fulfilling all the expectations placed upon him by making 65. He is not the sort of lad to look too far ahead but already he will have his eyes on a debut century. The last person to achieve that for England incidentally was Graham Thorpe, who on his own return to the fold was out first ball. </p> <p>The England innings had begun in such trying circumstances as Walsh and Ambrose probed mercilessly that after 10 overs only three runs had accrued for the loss of Mike Atherton, and Trescothick had yet to get off the mark. Both bowlers were awesome, but Walsh was incisive as well, following the leg cutter that Atherton edged to second slip with a lifter from nowhere that took the shoulder of Nasser Hussain's bat and looped to gully. Hussain had been given a life when Walsh stepped over the boundary rope in taking a catch. </p> <p>The next ball after Hussain was dismissed, Thorpe was made to look foolish with a wonderful slower ball that hit him on the boot as he turned his head to duck what he thought was a beamer. Walsh had taken three for nought in seven overs. Trescothick for his part had taken 25 deliveries to get off the mark and then on three had been dropped by Wavell Hinds at backward square leg as he hooked Franklyn Rose flat. </p> <p>The innings needed transformation and with Ambrose giving way to the change bowlers, Stewart was the man, cracking out his offside boundaries as first Rose and later Reon King dropped short and gave him width. His fifty took 63 balls with seven boundaries, his hundred a further 73 deliveries with six further boundaries. </p> <p>This was no second-fiddle innings from Trescothick, however, for after his steadfast start - no panic, just realism - he played some solid strokes himself, offering the bowler the full face of the bat, taking his singles as readily as he looked for boundaries and providing a foil to Stewart, with whom he began to learn his international trade in the triangular series. </p> <p>Hinds's drop apart, he might have been caught by more agile fielders than West Indies possess when he mishooked Rose and the ball looped gently over the bowler's head to fall in no man's land. But if it fazed him it did not show as he put his foot down the pitch to biff Adam's left- arm spin over square leg for six to reach his own half-century from 122 balls. </p> <p>The day ultimately and emphatically belonged to Stewart and England, but it had begun, beneath the blanket of cloud that persisted throughout the day, in positive fashion for West Indies as Adams and Ramnaresh Sarwan continued the process of resurrecting their innings after the damage caused by Darren Gough and his partners on the previous evening. </p> <p>Adams had some early luck when he played Andy Caddick on to his stumps without dislodging a bail and Sarwan was struck so hard in the ribs by Craig White's bouncer - there is more meat on a butcher's pencil than on Sarwan and White, from an ambling run and easy action, is seriously fast - that he needed a hospital x-ray that confirmed a cracked rib. </p> <p>The pair survived the first hour, however, taking their fifth-wicket stand to 69 before Sarwan, concentration broken by the first drinks' interval, was lbw for 36 to Cork's first ball after the restart. It set in motion the chain of events that saw the last six wickets fall for 39 runs. </p> <p>Ridley Jacobs was promptly yorked by the first ball of a new spell from Caddick, and then in quick succession Adams was taken at third slip, Ambrose stunningly caught by Hussain at mid-on and after lunch Dominic Cork rounded things off with two further wickets giving him a flattering four for 23.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Big Chief Elizabeth: How England's Adventurers Gambled and Won the New World</strong> by Giles Milton 384pp, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a314.99 </p> <p> One of the most memorable scenes in The Tempest comes when Trinculo first happens upon Caliban, spreadeagled on the ground. Trinculo takes a whiff of the fishy-smelling shape before him and goes into a woozy reverie about the fortune he could make from exhibiting Caliban back home: \"Were I in England now, as once I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday-fool there but would give a piece of silver. There would this monster make a man - any strange beast there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out 10 to see a dead Indian.\" </p> <p>It was not unusual in the 1580s for natives from the New World to be brought over to London, where they were displayed like human cabinets of curiosities for metropolitan audiences to gawp at. It was less common, however, for natives to be ferried to the metropolis for intellectual and strategic reasons. A rare example was Manteo, an American Indian, whose story is one of the highlights of Giles Milton's swashbuckling history of Elizabethan adventurers. </p> <p>That Manteo could have been seen wandering through Cheapside and the Strand during the autumn of 1584, his hair decked with feathers and his shivering body wrapped in deerskin breeches, was as a direct result of English mercantile ambitions. Conquering America captivated traders and thrill-seekers throughout the 16th century, and many blew fortunes trying to establish colonies there. They were stymied by poor resources and leadership, and by their limited knowledge not only of the bearings and vegetation of the territories they wanted to usurp, but of the languages and customs of those lands' owners. Off they would sail, people like Humphrey Gilbert - arrogant, \"tally ho\"-ing, eager to employ the techniques of violence refined in Ireland when putting down peasant revolts. Back they would totter, if they were lucky, mumbling tales of starvation and sea-madness. </p> <p>All things considered, English attempts at empire-building in the New World were naive and half-baked until Walter Raleigh appeared on the scene. Poet and peacock (buffed and pink satin-vested, he cut a dash around a court in which most of the older members were miserable scrotes whose pudding-basin cuts made them look like \"old Holland cheese\"), he was also Gilbert's younger half-brother. There would be no further voyages, he decided, without better technical expertise. He summoned the Oxonian scholar Thomas Harriot, whose mathematical skills were deployed to work out key principles of navigation. And when Raleigh ordered his men to bring back a native Indian from the American coast, it was Harriot's unparalleled linguistic prowess that proved invaluable.

      "bodyText": "Big Chief Elizabeth: How England's Adventurers Gambled and Won the New World by Giles Milton 384pp, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a314.99 One of the most memorable scenes in The Tempest comes when Trinculo first happens upon Caliban, spreadeagled on the ground. Trinculo takes a whiff of the fishy-smelling shape before him and goes into a woozy reverie about the fortune he could make from exhibiting Caliban back home: \"Were I in England now, as once I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday-fool there but would give a piece of silver. There would this monster make a man - any strange beast there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out 10 to see a dead Indian.\" It was not unusual in the 1580s for natives from the New World to be brought over to London, where they were displayed like human cabinets of curiosities for metropolitan audiences to gawp at. It was less common, however, for natives to be ferried to the metropolis for intellectual and strategic reasons. A rare example was Manteo, an American Indian, whose story is one of the highlights of Giles Milton's swashbuckling history of Elizabethan adventurers. That Manteo could have been seen wandering through Cheapside and the Strand during the autumn of 1584, his hair decked with feathers and his shivering body wrapped in deerskin breeches, was as a direct result of English mercantile ambitions. Conquering America captivated traders and thrill-seekers throughout the 16th century, and many blew fortunes trying to establish colonies there. They were stymied by poor resources and leadership, and by their limited knowledge not only of the bearings and vegetation of the territories they wanted to usurp, but of the languages and customs of those lands' owners. Off they would sail, people like Humphrey Gilbert - arrogant, \"tally ho\"-ing, eager to employ the techniques of violence refined in Ireland when putting down peasant revolts. Back they would totter, if they were lucky, mumbling tales of starvation and sea-madness. All things considered, English attempts at empire-building in the New World were naive and half-baked until Walter Raleigh appeared on the scene. Poet and peacock (buffed and pink satin-vested, he cut a dash around a court in which most of the older members were miserable scrotes whose pudding-basin cuts made them look like \"old Holland cheese\"), he was also Gilbert's younger half-brother. There would be no further voyages, he decided, without better technical expertise. He summoned the Oxonian scholar Thomas Harriot, whose mathematical skills were deployed to work out key principles of navigation. And when Raleigh ordered his men to bring back a native Indian from the American coast, it was Harriot's unparalleled linguistic prowess that proved invaluable. Day after day he quizzed the tattoo-faced Manteo, from whose words he created a 36-character alphabet made up of algebraic symbols, Greek and Roman letters and invented figures. Set down on paper they looked, according to one scholar, \"like devills\". The information Manteo provided, however, was divine.

It suggests rural simplicity tweaked, enhanced by modern technology and superior management skills. Though George Saunders uses it as the title of a story set in a theme park, it could also be his wry comment on the circumstances of the unnamed narrator, whose job is to impersonate a caveman. He lives in a cave and sleeps in a \"separate area\" equipped with a fax machine. On the cave walls are fake pictographs; outside, a herd of \"robotic something-or- others\" appears to be feeding. </p> <p>Saunders's bitterly funny stories here and in his extraordinary debut, CivilWarLand in Bad Decline (1996), succeed in squeezing meaning and emotional resonance out of absurd, post-real predicaments. His satirical jabs are sharp and scary, but also sad and unexpectedly touching. In Pastoralia, the faux -caveman is urged to denounce a \"subpar\" colleague, but resists with a truth so primitive it shocks: \"'She's a friend,' I say.\" Though he's meek and dim, beset by troubles and half-brainwashed by his inane job, he acquires with that single utterance a provisional heroism. In Saunders's world, that's the best you can hope for. </p> <p>Saunders specialises in giving losers - the ugly, the weak, the self-absorbed - a flicker of appeal or delusional hope. We meet them in motivational seminars, drivers' education courses, walking home from dead-end jobs. We follow them to places like Sea Oak, with \"no sea and no oak, just 100 subsidised apartments and a rear view of FedEx\". Inside those apartments, the tenants are watching TV: \"How My Child Died Violently is hosted by Matt Merton, a six-foot-five blond who's always giving the parents shoulder rubs and telling them they've been sainted by pain.\" </p> <p>Saunders's stories present an unsettling amalgam of degraded language and high art: slogans, jargon and the crippling incoherence of daily speech, arranged on the page with meticulous care. He cherishes the brutal solecisms of the American vernacular, working them for laughs and the odd shot of beauty, too. Who can resist a high school education \"mini-session\" called \"Who You Do Is Up To You\"? </p> <p>Less shocking, less zany than CivilWarLand in Bad Decline, in which the subnormal, paranormal and not yet normal all clamour for a hearing, Pastoralia sticks mostly to plausible absurdities. There's one ghost story, but the supernatural dimension is eclipsed by the ghost's all-too-human complaint: \"Why do some people get everything and I got nothing?\" The rest of the stories succeed on the strength of fine-tuning, not special effects. </p> <p>A darling of American critics, Saunders was last year chosen by The New Yorker as one of the 20 best fiction writers under 40. Though his sensibility is easy to spot, it's nearly impossible to pick out his voice. He's a self-erasing author, happy to let other voices do the work. This absence could be ominous - a black hole that sucks in the contemporary scene and spits out satire - but it reads more like confidence, or serene faith, or philosophical calm.

Ludwig James, disfigured by a rare skin disease and back in London after years spent procuring labour for the jungle empire of a maniacal Brazilian millionaire, runs over 14-year-old Aesop, petty thief and innocent from a Hackney estate.

Particularly impressive is Wall's subtle exploration of the relationship between creativity and mental instability, again something of a clich\u00e9 but deployed to good effect here.

Not content with colonising virtually every terrestrial habitat, we seem compelled to explore environments that are incompatible with human existence. In Life at the Extremes, Frances Ashcroft considers high-altitude flight, deep-sea diving and space exploration to illustrate the important role the science of physiology has played in human endeavour. Our bodies either adapt, malfunction or cease to function at all when exposed to extremes of temperature, pressure, radiation, atmospheric composition and gravitational force. Potentially fatal conditions such as heatstroke, decompression \"bends\" and altitude sickness, as well as health problems arising from the micro-gravity of orbit, can be prevented, or at least ameliorated, with an understanding of the underlying physiological changes. </p> <p>Ashcroft is professor of physiology at Oxford University: her material serves her well. Not only is the science interesting, but the way in which knowledge has been gained constitutes a compelling blend of the intrepid and the tragic. Over the years physiologists and explorers have subjected themselves to severe conditions in attempts to define the processes of, and limits to, physiological adaptation. Life at the Extremes is replete with accounts of scientists incarcerating themselves in test chambers and gradually varying the atmospheric pressure or concentration of oxygen, their capacity for rational thought declining prior to the onset of temporary blindness, unconsciousness and convulsions. Field experimentation has had more serious consequences: limbs and lives have been lost in sub-zero temperatures, and one of the first high-altitude balloon flights returned to earth with two of its three occupants dead. </p> <p>In tandem with her account of human physiology, Ashcroft describes the ways other organisms have evolved for life under varied conditions. From airless subterranean rocks to hot, acidic geothermal springs, from arid deserts to the oppressive salinity of the Dead Sea, there is virtually no environment on earth in which some form of life cannot be found. There may be only a scattering of primitive, unicellular organisms, but as long as liquid water is periodically present, evolution has resulted in an accommodation between environment and life - hence the excitement over the possibility of water on Mars. </p> <p>The account of \"black smokers\", volcanic vents in the ocean floor from which continuous plumes of superheated water are discharged, is particularly noteworthy. The vast, frigid darkness of the deep ocean supports only a sparse population of organisms, yet in the immediate vicinity of black smokers countless shrimp, fish, crabs and clams teem in a precarious ecosystem. \"Too close to the smoker and they are boiled alive, too far away and they freeze or starve to death.\" </p> <p> Life at the Extremes incorporates a broad sweep of disciplines, from aviation medicine to Greek mythology. Although Ashcroft has enlisted the advice of specialists in a number of different fields, there is the occasional sense that she is overreaching herself. For the most part her command of what is a huge range of subjects appears assured, but a couple of her forays into clinical medicine are oversim plified, if not misinformed, and at times her marine biology extends only as far as descriptions of nameless (but beautifully coloured) fish. </p> <p>The book is intended for the general reader, and as such the science has to be presented in balanced, comprehensible terms. This is a tricky task, with pitfalls on either side. Although Ashcroft manages it reasonably well, there are passages in which she drifts too far into the language of the academic text. Paradoxically, at other times she appears lacking in rigour. Having previously described how mammalian cells die when heated above 50 C, she comments: \"Fortunately, air temperatures on Earth seldom exceed 50 C.\" Given everything she argues about the tendency for evolution to broker compromises between environmental conditions and life, this statement - and there are others like it - is nonsensical. Self-evidently, mammalian cells have evolved to function in the temperature ranges they have, precisely because those are the temperatures they habitually encounter. </p> <p>Ashcroft has chosen to punctuate the book with anecdotes from her own life, intended as colloquial hooks on which to hang the next slab of raw science. They can be endearing, but for the most part they are tenuous and obtrusive, if not patronising. Was there any need, in describing Robert Boyle's famous law as to how the volume of gas varies with pressure, to mention that it was \"formulated in his Oxford laboratory, which lies not far from my own\"? </p> <p> Life at the Extremes is an eclectic overview, and as such it displays neither the overarching ambition of books such as Richard Dawkins's The Selfish Gene , nor the narrative instinct of writers such as Marcus Chown, whose Afterglow of Creation is a masterpiece of scientific storytelling.

His first collection, Flowering Limbs , was an impressive, appropriately surreal account of adolescence; Dream City Cinema a dazzling hymn of entropy. In his first novel, an apparently autobiographical remembrance of his childhood, Knight expresses himself in a different medium without losing any of his effectiveness. </p> <p> Mr Schnitzel contains two narratives.

      "bodyText": "Mr Schnitzel by Stephen Knight 240pp, Viking, \u00a310.99 Stephen Knight is one of Britain's best, if undervalued, poets. His first collection, Flowering Limbs , was an impressive, appropriately surreal account of adolescence; Dream City Cinema a dazzling hymn of entropy. In his first novel, an apparently autobiographical remembrance of his childhood, Knight expresses himself in a different medium without losing any of his effectiveness. Mr Schnitzel contains two narratives. The main text consists of seven fairy-tales told to Stephen by his father, \"stories for a five-year-old unsettled by sleeping in a strange bed in a strange country\". The footnotes, which form the other narrative, relate the reasons for that situation. Stephen's mother is Austrian, regretful that she ever left that country and returning every summer; his father is Welsh, and his job often prevents him joining his wife and child until later in the holiday.

      "body": "<p><strong> Love, Etc</strong> by Julian Barnes 249pp, Cape, \u00a315.99 </p> <p> Are there any good sequels to great novels? Or, more to the point, any great sequels to good novels? Of course there are fictional trilogies, tetralogies and chronicles: the quartets of Alexandria and the Raj; Updike's Rabbit series; Larry McMurtry's Texas and Anthony Powell's London. Children's series offer the adventures of an Adrian Mole or a Harry Potter. And there are posthumous commercial sequels to famous novels, especially those of Jane Austen. But on the whole, novelists seem to prefer to get it right the first time, and to preserve the illusion of a complete and finished narrative. Salinger hasn't tackled Holden at 50; Burgess didn't imagine Alex as a father; Amis doesn't do John Self as a dot.com entrepreneur. </p> <p>Until now, Julian Barnes has shared this prejudice against bringing the story up to date. A decade ago, when asked which novels should have sequels, he answered \"none\". But Talking It Over (1991), he told Guardian interviewer Nicholas Wroe, is the only book he has written that made readers ask what happened to the characters afterwards. In Love, Etc he has returned to the love triangle of Stuart, Oliver and Gillian and picked up the story 10 years later, with the characters once more explaining their personal versions of what happened to an unseen reporter, auditor or reader. Stuart even comments that such a technique is more realistic: \"In life, every ending is just the start of another story.\" </p> <p>I can understand that readers would wonder how the marriage of Gillian and Oliver, and the career of the jilted Stuart, turned out. Talking It Over not only presents a scandalous tale of a charismatic slacker seducing away the new bride of his more conventional \"best friend\", but also ends with a sensational scene in which Gillian goads mercurial new husband Oliver into hitting her in the village square for the benefit of lurking, heartbroken ex-husband Stuart, in order to perform an act of emotional exorcism. </p> <p>Was Oliver really a wife-beater at heart? Would Gill repent her divorce and remarriage? Would Stuart feel avenged and released? \"You didn't think that was the end of the story?\" Stuart asks the reader in the new book. \"Maybe I wish it had been. But life never lets you go, does it? You can't put down life the way you put down a book.\" </p> <p>In the 1996 French film version of the novel, also called Love, Etc, the director Marion Vernoux provided a sentimental resolution to these lingering questions. The trio (reimagined as cute French lovers, with Charlotte Gainsbourg as a frail, gamine version of Barnes's strong Gillian and the two men as a juvenile Jules et Jim) meet for a millennial reunion in Normandy, skipping along the beach in matching fur hats. There's a Gallic hint of triangulated desire - the men hold hands behind the woman's back. </p> <p>But Barnes's sequel is much more cruel. Indeed, Love, Etc is the gothic version of Talking It Over, in which romantic comedy has turned into madness and horror. Because of the scandal, Gill and Oliver have had to leave their idyllic French village and return to the remote higher postal codes of north London, where he has a breakdown after being disinherited by his father and she supports their family with her picture-restoring business. Meanwhile, Stuart makes a lot of money as an entrepreneur in the States. He remarries and redivorces, and finally returns to London; ostensibly on business, but really to carry out his long-fantasised revenge on Oliver. </p> <p>In many respects, then, plus \u00e7a change .

      "bodyText": "Love, Etc by Julian Barnes 249pp, Cape, \u00a315.99 Are there any good sequels to great novels? Or, more to the point, any great sequels to good novels? Of course there are fictional trilogies, tetralogies and chronicles: the quartets of Alexandria and the Raj; Updike's Rabbit series; Larry McMurtry's Texas and Anthony Powell's London. Children's series offer the adventures of an Adrian Mole or a Harry Potter. And there are posthumous commercial sequels to famous novels, especially those of Jane Austen. But on the whole, novelists seem to prefer to get it right the first time, and to preserve the illusion of a complete and finished narrative. Salinger hasn't tackled Holden at 50; Burgess didn't imagine Alex as a father; Amis doesn't do John Self as a dot.com entrepreneur. Until now, Julian Barnes has shared this prejudice against bringing the story up to date. A decade ago, when asked which novels should have sequels, he answered \"none\". But Talking It Over (1991), he told Guardian interviewer Nicholas Wroe, is the only book he has written that made readers ask what happened to the characters afterwards. In Love, Etc he has returned to the love triangle of Stuart, Oliver and Gillian and picked up the story 10 years later, with the characters once more explaining their personal versions of what happened to an unseen reporter, auditor or reader. Stuart even comments that such a technique is more realistic: \"In life, every ending is just the start of another story.\" I can understand that readers would wonder how the marriage of Gillian and Oliver, and the career of the jilted Stuart, turned out. Talking It Over not only presents a scandalous tale of a charismatic slacker seducing away the new bride of his more conventional \"best friend\", but also ends with a sensational scene in which Gillian goads mercurial new husband Oliver into hitting her in the village square for the benefit of lurking, heartbroken ex-husband Stuart, in order to perform an act of emotional exorcism. Was Oliver really a wife-beater at heart? Would Gill repent her divorce and remarriage? Would Stuart feel avenged and released? \"You didn't think that was the end of the story?\" Stuart asks the reader in the new book. \"Maybe I wish it had been. But life never lets you go, does it? You can't put down life the way you put down a book.\" In the 1996 French film version of the novel, also called Love, Etc, the director Marion Vernoux provided a sentimental resolution to these lingering questions. The trio (reimagined as cute French lovers, with Charlotte Gainsbourg as a frail, gamine version of Barnes's strong Gillian and the two men as a juvenile Jules et Jim) meet for a millennial reunion in Normandy, skipping along the beach in matching fur hats. There's a Gallic hint of triangulated desire - the men hold hands behind the woman's back. But Barnes's sequel is much more cruel. Indeed, Love, Etc is the gothic version of Talking It Over, in which romantic comedy has turned into madness and horror. Because of the scandal, Gill and Oliver have had to leave their idyllic French village and return to the remote higher postal codes of north London, where he has a breakdown after being disinherited by his father and she supports their family with her picture-restoring business. Meanwhile, Stuart makes a lot of money as an entrepreneur in the States. He remarries and redivorces, and finally returns to London; ostensibly on business, but really to carry out his long-fantasised revenge on Oliver. In many respects, then, plus \u00e7a change . Stuart is still literal-minded and businesslike; Oliver is still a fey dilettante, doing the odd stint as a tutor while he writes unmarketable screenplays. Gillian is still the queen of denial, while her French mother still plays at being the wise older woman. New voices have entered the conversation, including Stuart's American second wife Terri, and Oliver's psychiatrist and troubled teenage daughter.

That's him staring out from the covers of Trout Fishing in America and The Hawkline Monster like some long-haired pioneer, a different woman beside him in every photograph. His novels and collections of short stories are tender, eccentric meditations which sold by the lorryload. But in the 1980s something happened. His publishers/readers/ reviewers (take your pick) are said to have turned against him. His boozing got out of hand, his depression got the better of him, and in October 1984 he was found in his house by the ocean having shot himself with a .44 Magnum. </p> <p>For most of the 1990s the only way to get your fix of Brautigan was to trawl through the second-hand bookshops, but over the last couple of years Rebel Inc has been quietly publishing its own editions of his back catalogue. Now it presents two curiosities to accompany them: a \"lost\" Brautigan novel and a memoir by his daughter, Ianthe. </p> <p>It's hard to pick up any posthumous publication without some degree of scepticism, and An Unfortunate Woman is no exception. The book takes the form of what Brautigan calls a \"calendar map\", as he travels from San Fran cisco to Buffalo, Toronto, Chicago, Hawaii and back to his ranch in Montana. Its fragmentary nature needn't necessarily concern us - one of his best collections, The Tokyo-Montana Express , was about as fragmentary as a book could be. What's more troubling are the large gaps between entries and the occasional note of distraction, as if for once the writing is not the most important thing. </p> <p>His subjects are uncharacteristically sombre (an abandoned cemetery, a rape in the neighbourhood, a friend's death from cancer), although there are enough passages that remind you of him at his idiosyncratic best. His mountain ranch seems to revive his Zen-like humour - who else would contemplate how the snow on the distant Rockies thaws into the stream that flows through his garden where he fills the ice tray for his fridge? But by far the darkest shadow is that cast by Brautigan's approaching suicide. By some terrible twist we find ourselves more omniscient than the author, so that when he talks of looking for \"some tranquillity . . . a little more distance between the frustrations and agonies in my life\", we know what hope he has of finding it. </p> <p>Considering how revealing he can be in his own books, it is perhaps not surprising that by the end of You Can't Catch Death , his daughter Ianthe's memoir, we feel that we have not learned a great deal more than we already knew. Through a series of vignettes she recounts her time with him in San Francisco (her parents separated when she was young), their changing relationship and her growing concerns for him. Along the way we hear of his drinking binges: the time he made a bonfire of all the house's telephones, the time he and a friend shot out the numbers on the face of the clock in the kitchen, the benders with Dennis Hopper (which gives some idea of the kind of quantities involved). </p> <p>At times, Brautigan appears so preoccupied with himself that he threatens to neglect his daughter; she sometimes seems to have more of a parental instinct than he does himself. But it's the stories of the privations in Brautigan's own childhood that are the most affecting. As a young man, he was so hungry he smashed the windows of the local police station hoping to get himself arrested and fed. The plan went badly wrong. He was committed to a mental institution and given EST - something he believed his mother could have saved him from. When he finally got out, he vowed never to speak to her again. Ianthe remembers him showing her a photo - shortly before setting fire to it - and it's only when she sets out to try and track down her grandmother that the writing slips into gear and escapes its self-consciousness. </p> <p>Johnny Rotten once warned us against trusting hippies. It's Brautigan's fate, having died when he did, to be condemned to a sort of eternal hippydom. But it would be a crime if the manner of his death were to contaminate his books, so that what once read like the words of a revolutionary became a manic depressive's verbal tics. He deserves better - he was an absolute original who found cause for celebration in the most unlikely places. The cover of every book should carry the slogan: Richard Brautigan - the hippy you can trust. </p> <p>\u0095 Mick Jackson's The Underground Man was shortlisted for the Booker.

At the end of the 17th century, Scotland, caught in a slow stranglehold of English economic sanctions, decided to join the dash for colonial land in South America.

Whereas the chief inspector pursues a rational, scientific enquiry, his wife, haunted by the crime, prefers divination and the tarot.

      "body": "<p><strong> Karl Marx</strong>, by Francis Wheen (Fourth Estate, 431pp, \u00a38.99) </p> <p> This book created such a stir when it came out that I feel I hardly have to summarize it. Still, here it is: the warts-and-all, lively and highly readable biography of the man whose self-proclaimed heirs shaped half the 20th century. Wheen's technique will be familiar to readers of his column in this paper: respect for the facts, determination to stick up for what one believes in, an instinctive and, I must add, wholly appropriate distrust of those with a right-wing agenda; and a certain matiness of tone at which some readers might raise an eyebrow, as it is, at times, more matey than his Guardian column. For example: Marx may have said that philosophers have interpreted the world, but \"the point is to change it\", yet Wheen remarks: \"Nevertheless, Marx and Engels proceeded to spend the winter of 1845-6 theorising like billy-o as they composed their German Ideology.\" </p> <p>You will also find rum coves, boobies, squiffy letters written after lunch and scallywags. Well, this is his way. He more or less directly signposts his influences when discussing Henry Hyndman, the Eton and Trinity-educated socialist who made Marx's last years more of a trial than they already were. \"There is more than a trace of him\", Wheen writes, \"in PG Wodehouse's character Psmith, who converted to Marxism when he was expelled from Eton... thereafter he addressed everyone as 'Comrade'.\" </p> <p>Personally, I think Comrade Wheen has done a fine job, and if it takes the shade of PGW to help him on his way then so be it. The key phrase in the first paragraph is \"highly readable\", for to resurrect Marx for the average reader is to do humanity a favour in both the long and short runs. There were one or two reviewers who despaired that Wheen reduced so much of Marx's political and philosophical thought to what amounts to not much more than the literary equivalent of a thumbs-up; but (a) this is preferable to a thumbs-down, and (b) it will send readers off to the original texts. (Not to mention to Martin Rowson's remarkable cartoon book, Scenes from the Lives of the Great Socialists , in which the pun-laden escapades of Marx and Engels will be seen to have more relation to reality than previously supposed.) </p> <p>\"Rowdiness and blackguardism,\" wrote Marx in an editorial for the Rheinische Zeitung, \"must be loudly and resolutely repudiated in a period which demands serious, manly, and sober-minded persons for the achievement of its lofty aims.\" A few years later, he was smashing gas-lamps and being chased by the police after an epic pub-crawl up the Tottenham Court Road; while borrowing money from his baker, he would also complain of exiled revolutionaries who never had jobs; long resident in London, he would regularly despair of the workers' failure to do anything momentous with their discontent (\"these thick-headed John Bulls, whose brainpans seem to have been specially manufactured for the constables' bludgeons\"). </p> <p>Wheen's Marx is a loveable old rogue (Engels emerges as a long-suffering hero); he may have been hypocritical in the kind of minor details that intellectual pipsqueaks like Paul Johnson make so much of; he may have been a hector and an intellectual bully - there was a reason why there were only 11 mourners at his funeral - but he was also charming, funny, and a devoted father. It is this last that I find such an affecting detail, and one that is lovingly treated by Wheen; as for the old man's death, I found myself wiping away a tear, and I dare say I wasn't the only reader to do that.</p> <p>\u0095 To order this book for \u00a36.99 plus 99p p&amp;p call Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.</p>",
