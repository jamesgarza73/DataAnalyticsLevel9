      "bodyText": "Andrew Cole's flying start to the season has been brought to a juddering halt with the news that he will be out until next year because of an achilles tendon injury. Although Cole was able to participate fully in Manchester United's victory over Dynamo Kiev on Wednesday night, which ensured their progress into the second phase of the Champions League, the striker was ruled out of Peter Taylor's England squad which was announced yesterday. Cole has been an ever-present for England this season, playing the full 90 minutes in each of Kevin Keegan's last three games in charge - the friendly against France and the World Cup qualifiers against Germany and Finland - although he is yet to score a goal for his country. While the 29-year-old will miss next week's friendly against Italy in Turin, he should be back in contention to win his 11th cap in the match against Spain at Villa Park in February. Cole, who has scored nine goals this season as his partnership with Teddy Sheringham has blossomed, will undergo surgery on Tuesday and is expected to be out for two months. United were keen to avoid losing Cole before they had secured their progress from the first phase of the Champions League and, although he will miss the first two matches of the second phase, Sir Alex Ferguson said yesterday that his striker could not afford to wait any longer. \"Andy has been carrying this for so long now that it's necessary,\" United's manager said. \"Now we are over the first stage of the Champions League we hope he will be ready for the next stage. It's disappointing, but it needs to be done.\" Cole is also likely to miss 10 Premiership matches, including the derby against Manchester City a week on Sunday and the visit of Liverpool to Old Trafford on December 17. With Sheringham, who has scored 12 goals this season, in such prolific form Dwight Yorke and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be fighting for Cole's place in United's attack. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "Telecoms regulator Oftel has told BT it expected \"further improvements\" before it is satisfied that the company is doing all it can to open up its local exchanges to competing telecoms and internet service providers. Anne Lambert, Oftel director of operations, was speaking today after BT announced plans to allow rival operators access to 600 of its local exchanges by July 2001. The unbundling move will give operators - including those offering high-speed internet services - access to BT's local loop networks, which are the local copper wire between an exchange and officer or home. Ms Lambert said: \"Oftel has made it clear to BT that it expects further improvements to be made and we will ensure that no resources are spared in preparing its exchanges as quickly as possible. \"There is a lot more work to be done by Oftel, BT and the operators. But today gives a sound basis for taking the process forward.\" BT is proposing to unbundle 190 local loops where operators can install the necessary equipment in its exchanges and 410 where they must find space in adjacent buildings. After July 2001, BT is proposing to open up a further 200 local loops per month, with operators allowed into its exchanges in half the areas and finding their own accommodation in the other half. BT has also proposed a service level agreement that includes penalty payments for late delivery of local loop access. But rival telecoms operators, who have been lobbying Oftel for months to force BT to unbundle its local loops, remained sceptical about how quickly the company would move. Jonathan Watts, managing director of Colt Telecom, said that BT had already been committed to allowing rival operators into 190 of its local exchanges and in the 410 other exchange areas the plan \"relies on competitors finding properties as close as possible to the exchange and converting\". \"This is the second best option. It lets BT off the hook, because they don't have to allow us space in their exchanges.\" Mr Watts said the move was therefore \"not quite as significant as BT are claiming\", but was still the \"first time we have seen something positive\" happening on the local loop unbundling issue.",

The corporation has signed up with both the Go Racing consortium - formed by Channel 4, BSkyB and racecourse owner Arena Leisure - and Carlton Communications to continue covering its existing live horse racing events, including the Grand National. A BBC spokesman confirmed that as part of the agreement in principle with Carlton, the corporation would also acquire exclusive live rights to the Derby, which are currently held by Channel 4. It is also understood that under the terms agreed with Go Racing, Channel 4 could give up the Derby rights.",

      "bodyText": "The number of racist complaints against police escalated by 75% last year to the highest figure ever recorded, it was disclosed today. The Police Complaints Authority (PCA) dealt with 579 allegations of racist behaviour by police last year, compared to 331 the year before, according to their annual report released today. Complaints against officers have risen from 17% to 23% among ethnic minorities in general, with the percentage of complaints from the Asian community more than doubling over the last five years. One incident cited in the report centred on an officer who faced disciplinary action after referring to several Asian suspects as \"Pakis\". The PCA chairman, Sir Alistair Graham, said: \"We have seen a significant rise in the number of complaints of racially discriminatory behaviour by police officers. \"While we can only speculate as to the reasons for the increase, we believe it may reflect, in the aftermath of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, a greater willingness by members of the black and minority ethnic community to register a concern about how they feel they have been treated.\" The report also shows that the number of people dying in police stations almost halved from 36 in 1998-99 to 19 last year. The installation of more CCTV cameras in stations is partly behind the reduction, the report said. There was a record number of independent investigations into motor accidents involving police cars. A total of 22 people died and 16 were seriously injured in 21 pursuits investigated by the PCA. These 21 investigations last year compared with 17 the year before and nine in 1997-98. \"There is worrying evidence that the skill and judgment of some police drivers are open to question and criticism,\" said Sir Graham. The report also welcomed the Metropolitan police's decision to fit aircraft-style black boxes inside patrol cars. Last year saw the highest ever level of woman complainants - 24% of the total. The number of claims from people aged over 45 also rose from 8% in 1997-98 to 18% in 1999-2000. Other complaints included the issue of CS gas use. The report raised concerns over the spray being used at too close a range, being used in cars, when a subject was already restrained and accidentally spraying members of the public. In all, the PCA dealt with 17,932 complaints against police officers, including 182 of serious assault, 64 of sexual assault and 78 of corrupt practice. Within the report there was evidence of a number of regional hotspots for grievances against officers. Heading the league for the most complaints per officer is Cambridgeshire with one complaint for every 3.7 officers (342 complaints directed at 1,272 officers). This contrasts with one complaint for every 16.7 officers in Durham (93 complaints directed at 1,555 officers). Other high complaint areas include Suffolk and Sussex with one complaint for every four officers - 290/1,160 and 717/2,909 respectively. In Merseyside, the number of complaints per officer was just under one in five (822/4,071). In London there was one complaint for every 6.3 officers (4,045/25,885).

      "body": "<p><strong>BIG CUP ROUND TWO DRAW ONE</strong></p> <p>Today's Big Cup draw has an eerily - some might say suspiciously - familiar, ring to it. Just as in the first phase, Manchester United have an open goal of a group, and Arsenal's task is relatively straightforward too. Meanwhile, Leeds will have to get past Lazio, Anderlecht and Real Madrid, climb K2, and recite the weekly diet of Lennart Johannsen in Swedish before Uefa will let them anywhere near the quarter-finals.</p> <p>In any case, that's how the Fiver sees it, rubbing its strangely magnetic balls. Oddly enough, Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards agrees with us. After seeing his side paired with Valencia, Sturm Graz and Panathaniakos, he admitted: \"I think it is a good group. It could have been worse, as they say, and it's a draw which gives us a good opportunity of progressing.\" And with that he was off, presumably to plan a trip to Busty Birgit's Bordello Bar.</p> <p>Arsenal's vice-chairman David Dein was also happy with the draw, which sees the Gunners play Bayern Munich, Spartak Moscow and Lyon. \"Our aim is to win [Big Cup],\" he thundered, in a refreshing change to all this \"we're not old enough to win it\" baloney you get from some Premiership managers. Unsurprisingly, Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale was in a hippy, dippy, bordering-on-trippy mood. \"Coming back on the plane from Milan we were all dreaming about playing Real Madrid and going back to Rome again,\" he revealed, \"and we have got our wish.\" Ridsdale then went on to predict a Leeds v Manchester United final.

      "bodyText": "BIG CUP ROUND TWO DRAW ONE Today's Big Cup draw has an eerily - some might say suspiciously - familiar, ring to it. Just as in the first phase, Manchester United have an open goal of a group, and Arsenal's task is relatively straightforward too. Meanwhile, Leeds will have to get past Lazio, Anderlecht and Real Madrid, climb K2, and recite the weekly diet of Lennart Johannsen in Swedish before Uefa will let them anywhere near the quarter-finals. In any case, that's how the Fiver sees it, rubbing its strangely magnetic balls. Oddly enough, Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards agrees with us. After seeing his side paired with Valencia, Sturm Graz and Panathaniakos, he admitted: \"I think it is a good group. It could have been worse, as they say, and it's a draw which gives us a good opportunity of progressing.\" And with that he was off, presumably to plan a trip to Busty Birgit's Bordello Bar. Arsenal's vice-chairman David Dein was also happy with the draw, which sees the Gunners play Bayern Munich, Spartak Moscow and Lyon. \"Our aim is to win [Big Cup],\" he thundered, in a refreshing change to all this \"we're not old enough to win it\" baloney you get from some Premiership managers. Unsurprisingly, Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale was in a hippy, dippy, bordering-on-trippy mood. \"Coming back on the plane from Milan we were all dreaming about playing Real Madrid and going back to Rome again,\" he revealed, \"and we have got our wish.\" Ridsdale then went on to predict a Leeds v Manchester United final. Has he never been told to be careful what he wishes for? GOLIATH TO MEET PLUCKY DAVID The Fiver is always pleased when small clubs are rewarded for giant-killing exploits. So hats off to plucky Liverpool, who last night stunned the world of football by dumping mighty Slovan Liberec out of Euro Vase. The Reds, as they are known, have been paired with Greek giants Olympiakos - the lads from England must be wondering when they'll wake up! \"This is a very hard draw because they are a team who have won their championship in Greece and have performed very well in [Big Cup],\" said manager Gerard Houllier as commemorative flags were handed out to local children. \"They have already beaten Valencia and Lyon on their own ground, and both those teams are quality opposition,\" he continued, while excited civic dignitaries scuttled around him, putting up bunting. You won't witness this sort of innocent excitement in Glasgow, because Rangers, who take on German side Kaiserslautern, have been around the European block before. But who can blame the folk from the small northern English port for making the most of their fifteen minutes of fame? \"We will need the same attitude and effort again. I know they are a very skilful side,\" an emotional Houllier explained, as the whole town came to a standstill. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"We are not going to sit in armchairs\" - Blackburn boss Graeme Souness wants promotion so badly he's banned the use of bog-standard furniture. BFR 4 BCFC? Manager of Bradford City: it's the job nobody wants. First Paul Jewell walked out - in favour of Sheffield Wednesday, for God's sake - and then Chris Hutchings got all Machiavellian to make damn sure he didn't stay around any longer than was absolutely necessary. Even caretaker manager Stuart McCall has decided to distance himself from the permanent vacancy. No wonder, then, that a desperate Bradford board became interested in the litmus test that is Ron Atkinson: after all, if he's not interested, nobody will be. \"I'm not interested,\" Big Fat Ron flatly told firststake.com today. \"I've had no contact with Bradford at all.

Eventually, Ron realised where he was and decided to reiterate his position in a more sensible manner. \"I've retired from club football and nothing could tempt be back,\" he said in soft tones, before sprinting (well, waddling) as fast as he could in the opposite direction. So that's that, then. Poor old Bradford. Nobody will want the job now. Actually, Roy Evans is probably still up for it. THE RUMOUR MILL Peter Reid has issued a hands-off warning to Leeds, who are reportedly planning a \u00a313m plus Darren Huckerby bid for Kevin Phillips. Raja Casablanca midfielder Youssef Safri could join fellow Moroccans Youssef Chippo and Mustapha Hadji at Coventry in a \u00a31m deal, according to onefootball.com. Rangers flop Sebastian Rozental has been invited for a week's trial at Manchester City, with a view to a permanent move. Manager Joe Royle admitted: \"Sebastian is a world-class player on his day who has just turned 24. He will be joining us for the week when I can assess his fitness.\" NEWS IN BRIEF Teddy Sheringham has won the Carling player of the month award for October. Arsene's Arsenal Wenger was named manager of the month. David Seaman has sprained an ankle in training and could be out of action for at least three weeks.

The initial six-month tie-up, which encourages Two Way TV users to order pizza before playing games, is Two Way TV's third commercial deal following sponsorships from Sportal and the Rugby League World Cup. A button on the front page of the Two Way TV channel, which runs on the interactive areas of all cable channels and ONdigital, links through to Two Way TV/Domino's page where users can order food through their TV. The terms of the deal, brokered by Quantum New Media Services, means that Two Way TV will receive a small percentage of sales of pizza made through the service. Further cross-promotional deals are expected to be developed by Two Way TV and Domino's following this first tie-up. Two Way TV managing director Matthew Tims said: \"The deal will really add to the entertainment experience that is Two Way TV.\"",

Thousands of officers were stationed to prevent Arab men under 45 from entering the compound, which is Islam's third holiest site.

Police raised their batons before the prayers and moved towards the worshippers, kicking some and hitting others. Witnesses said that there were no casualties. Earlier, a small bomb was detonated in retaliation for a helicopter strike that killed a prominent militia leader, Hussein Abayat. The explosion, just outside the walled Old City, slightly injured a policeman on patrol to prevent violence outside Al Asqa. A newspaper poll today showed that two-thirds of Israelis favour peace talks, but that, if there is no agreement, 58% would prefer unilateral separation from the Palestinians instead of another interim accord, favored by 30%. Separation would involve Israel building a line of fortifications along the areas of the West Bank it intends to keep and patrolling them with its military. According to deputy defense minister Ephraim Sneh, who is drawing up the plan, Israel is not trying to cut itself off from the Palestinians or turn Gaza and the West Bank into large refugee camps full of starving people. The Gallup poll in the Maariv daily questioned 570 Israeli adults and quoted a 4.5% margin of error. Peace negotiations continued in Washington yesterday with a meeting between US president Bill Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.

Republicans expressed outrage at the Democratic demands, but suggested they might seek recounts in Iowa and Wisconsin, two states where Mr Gore won narrowly.</p> <p>Oregon, still counting, was so close that the secretary of state said the likelihood of an automatic recount was \"pretty high\"</p> <p>\"The Democrats, who are politicising and distorting these events, risk doing so at the...expense of our democracy,\" said Don Evans, the chairman of Mr Bush's campaign. \"Our democratic process calls for a vote on election day; it does not call for us to continue voting until someone likes the outcome.\"</p> <p>Eight lawsuits have been filed in state and federal courts to challenge the Florida results, including six in Palm Beach County and two in Tallahassee.</p> <p>Democratic party-backed lawsuits won't be filed until next week, party officials said.</p> <p>As for the two would-be presidents, Mr Gore was in public only briefly yesterday, emerging from a Nashville, Tennessee, hotel to jog with two of his daughters and his brother-in-law.</p> <p>\"We're having a great run here,\" the vice president shouted to reporters, then waved off all questions.</p> <p>Mr Bush was in Austin, Texas, where aides said he was toiling over transition plans.

Mr Gore had won 18 states plus the district of Columbia for 255, with 270 needed for victory. Political charges aside, the uncertainty overshadowed any talk of the transition to a new administration. The incomplete popular vote totals showed Mr Gore ahead, with 49,145,883 votes, or 48%. Mr Bush had 48,940,963, also 48%. But Mr Gore was not assured of even the uncritical popular vote lead because hundreds of thousands of overseas ballots remained to be counted nationwide. \"This is serious stuff. It's time to cool partisan passions or risk being damaged goods, even if you win the presidency,\" said Democratic consultant Jim Duffy. Passions seemed to escalate yesterday as the two sides swapped charges and several lawsuits were filed in Florida. The two sides clashed over the design of a ballot in Palm Beach County that left some Gore voters expressing concern they had inadvertently cast votes for Reform party candidate Pat Buchanan. In addition, the Gore campaign cited more than 19,000 Palm Beach County ballots that had been thrown out because they were marked for more than one presidential candidate. The Gore campaign criticised the ballots used in the county as confusing, and asked for a hand count of votes cast there and in Dade, Broward and Volusia counties - some 1.78m votes. Democrats also suggested they may call for a new election in Palm Beach County. Republicans expressed outrage at the Democratic demands, but suggested they might seek recounts in Iowa and Wisconsin, two states where Mr Gore won narrowly. Oregon, still counting, was so close that the secretary of state said the likelihood of an automatic recount was \"pretty high\" \"The Democrats, who are politicising and distorting these events, risk doing so at the...expense of our democracy,\" said Don Evans, the chairman of Mr Bush's campaign. \"Our democratic process calls for a vote on election day; it does not call for us to continue voting until someone likes the outcome.\" Eight lawsuits have been filed in state and federal courts to challenge the Florida results, including six in Palm Beach County and two in Tallahassee. Democratic party-backed lawsuits won't be filed until next week, party officials said. As for the two would-be presidents, Mr Gore was in public only briefly yesterday, emerging from a Nashville, Tennessee, hotel to jog with two of his daughters and his brother-in-law. \"We're having a great run here,\" the vice president shouted to reporters, then waved off all questions. Mr Bush was in Austin, Texas, where aides said he was toiling over transition plans. His running mate, Dick Cheney, who is expected to head any transition team, and Andrew Card, likely chief of staff in a Bush administration, spent the morning with the governor.

      "bodyText": "New media agency Traffic interactive has set up a new division devoted to interactive television. Stewart Atkins, a former producer at BBC Interactive who joined Traffic as operations director in September last year, is heading up the new department, taking on the new role of development director. As well as interactive TV, Mr Atkins will focus on other emerging technologies such as mobile and intelligent systems. Katie Purcer, former interactive television producer at Agency.com, joins as head of interactive television. Martin Child, managing director of Traffic, said it made sense to develop a dedicated department as the agency had been consulting on interactive TV and mobile projects for a while and clients were now working in this area. Traffic was founded in 1996 by PR gurus Matthew Freud and Alex Johnston, Abbott Mead Vickers and US firm House of Blues New Media. Freud Communications still owns a third of Traffic, but the remaining two-thirds was bought by Clarke Hooper Consulting at the end of 1997.",

      "bodyText": "Lycos Europe has bucked the trend in the European internet service provider market by slashing its losses. The company reduced its first quarter deficit by 40% to \u00a318m thanks to a canny cut in its marketing budget, and reported a 226% rise in revenues to \u00a39.5m. Lycos took \u00a313.9m off its advertising spend during the summer season, due to fears that many loyal customers would be on holiday. The gamble appears to have paid off. German media giant Bertelsmann is a key shareholder in the company alongside Terra Lycos, which was formed by the merger of Terra Networks and Lycos. Rumours persist that Bertelsmann wants to sell its stake to its partner, although it has a burgeoning e-commerce operation. Competition is strong in the European ISP sector, with T-Online of Germany, Wanadoo of France and Tiscali of Italy allbattling it out to take the role of market leader. However, the long-awaited consolidation spree has yet to happen, as the main competitors have been saddled by heavy losses, boardroom upheavals or a downturn in advertising. Bob Kommers, internet analyst at ABN Amro, said: \"The next quarter is crucial, because Christmas is traditionally a good time for internet companies. Everyone will be taking a close look at advertising growth, and subscriber figures.\"",

Jose Francisco Xavier Pacheco y Cuesta and his wife Diaz were recruited in 1942 in Belgium where they were performing. Mr Pacheco had been arrested in reprisal for the detention of German nationals in Cuba. An MI5 report described Mr Pacheco as a \"Cuban Romeo\" who had danced his way to a \"second-line stardom\". It added: \"At his zenith he was billed at the Winter Garden in Berlin and the Piccadilly hotel in London. Success was due as much to his wife as his personal endeavours.\" He was, said MI5, \"fundamentally a bad man\". MI5 continued: \"In so far as his wife is concerned, he would have had the world believe in a saga of devotion and affection. Actually, he has given her syphilis.\" Mr Pacheco was said to be not above accepting shares in illegal profits or bribes in the form of \"bottles of drink which were consumed at his wife's insistence at nightclubs which might well have been brothels\".

The US media giant, which owns the powerful ABC TV network, said first quarter profits will show little improvement compared to last year, due to a weak advertising market. Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation this week said it expected advertising revenue to fall in November and December, sending its shares down by 11%. The media conglomerate said operating income had fallen by $69m (\u00a348m) to $80m. Walt Disney said the situation will improve, but the announcement mirrors similar figures from internet company and stock market darling Yahoo! Shares in Granada Media took a hammering last month following a warning about slow advertising growth. The problem was underlined by US online advertising companies 24/7 Media and Engage, which said they were suffering from a short-term slow-down in revenues. The bad news from Disney and the web advertisers was enough to hit AOL and Time Warner's shares, which fell 5% in New York. Walt Disney's bad luck has even spread to ABC's \"Who wants to be a Millionaire\" series, which has suffered from disappointing ratings.",

      "bodyText": "I was bought up in a political family,\" says Jack Edwards, an 87-year-old Liverpudlian now living in Telford. \"We went to Young Communist League and Labour League of Youth meetings, so we knew what was happening in Spain. We thought we'd do something a bit better than sit around in England.\" The decision to head south in the late winter of 1936 was taken quickly. \"It wasn't long thought out,\" he says. \"A few of us got a weekend ticket to Paris, you didn't have to have a passport then, got picked up and taken to Spain.\" Edwards had no naive preconceptions of the conditions he was going to face. \"I expected it to be very rough, and it was rough.\" He was soon wounded at Jarama, but stayed in the country, determined to help. After convalescing, Edwards, a motor mechanic by trade, found himself separated from the International Brigades, working on vehicles with the Spanish republicans around Valencia. \"Being with the Spanish people helped me understand what they were fighting for,\" he says. \"They had voted for that government, and there it was being overthrown.\" Because of his isolation, Edwards was unaware of the withdrawal of foreign troops. He eventually made it back to Liverpool in March 1939. Straight after his return, Edwards joined the RAF. \"It was a continuation. I wasn't fighting against Germany or Italy, I was fighting for democracy. If Germany had won there would have been none.\"",

However, this film failed to catch the public's imagination in the way that 1991's Silence of The Lambs did, which made \u00a3192m worldwide and won five Oscars.</p> <p>Hopkins's involvement in the new project will depend in the script. Producer Dino De Laurentiis believes that fans of Hopkin's cannibalistic doctor want to know how Lecter - safely enconsed in prison at the start of Silence of the Lambs - arrived there in the first place. \"Red Dragon is about the crime Hannibal Lecter committed and the way he was arrested,\" he said. \"Hannibal Lecter escaped in Silence of the Lambs, and in Hannibal, you see him in a new situation in Florence. . . the audience would like to know, once and forever, why, where and by whom Hannibal Lecter was arrested.\" </p> <p>Hannibal, directed by Ridley Scott, is due for release next year. It follows the attempts of one of the doctor's former victims to exact a slow and painful revenge - involving mad-eating pigs.

      "bodyText": "The blockbuster merger between AOL and Time Warner hangs in the balance after US regulators sent the \u00a391bn deal into extra time. US watchdog the Federal Trade Commission has given the internet giant and media conglomerate three weeks to rescue the deal. Anti-trust officials want Time Warner's cable network to be made available to other internet service providers, since the company controls around 20% of the US cable market. The companies have agreed to the regulator's demands in principle, but have clashed with the FTC over enforcing them. Sources close to the negotiations claim that the open access dispute is the tip of the iceberg, and that the parties remain some way apart. Both partners are being encouraged to sign a deal with a rival ISP to soothe the concerns of smaller players in the internet market, and the three-week stay of execution gives them time to seek out a suitable company. AOL and Time Warner said they expected the merger to go through by the end of the year, but the management at both companies are known to be shocked at the resistance to a deal announced last January. The world's biggest media merger also struggled to get past European regulators, who demanded that AOL drop all links with German rival Bertelsmann. European competition commissioner Mario Monti also effectively killed off the \u00a312bn joint venture between record company EMI and Time Warner subsidiary Warner Music because of fears that AOL would capitalise on the deal.",

There is a three-part documentary on cannibalism, which looks at killers Jeffrey Dahmer and Issei Sagawa, who ate their victims. </p> <p>The channel will also screen three dramas \"designed to shock\". Shot in a Blair Witch Project-style, the Shockers series features a mother who takes a brutal revenge on school bullies. </p> <p>Two new drama series will concentrate on personal relationships. Metrosexuality features an unconventional set of friends in Notting Hill, London, and Teachers, starring This Life's Andrew Lincoln, is described as \"Ally McBeal set in a comprehensive school\". </p> <p>Mr Gardam said that the line-up was distinctive, and he attacked BBC1 and ITV for their programmes, saying: \"The future of quality television does not have to be two episodes of EastEnders sandwiching The Weakest Link.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Channel 4's satirical series the 11 O'Clock Show, which featured the spoof rapper Ali G, is facing the axe. The channel fears the show has lost its edge since the departure of Sacha Baron Cohen, the creator of Ali G, who now has his own series. The presenters, Iain Lee and Daisy Donovan, have also left. When the series started last year it quickly drew a cult following. \"It seems that we always do better when we do something new,\" one Channel 4 executive said. \"If we decide the show has become atrophied, then we should stop it.\" Yesterday, at the launch of the channel's winter season line-up, Tim Gardam, director of programmes, said: \"I haven't decided yet\", in answer to questions about the show's return. The new line-up appears to be dominated by sex and death. There is a three-part documentary on cannibalism, which looks at killers Jeffrey Dahmer and Issei Sagawa, who ate their victims. The channel will also screen three dramas \"designed to shock\". Shot in a Blair Witch Project-style, the Shockers series features a mother who takes a brutal revenge on school bullies. Two new drama series will concentrate on personal relationships. Metrosexuality features an unconventional set of friends in Notting Hill, London, and Teachers, starring This Life's Andrew Lincoln, is described as \"Ally McBeal set in a comprehensive school\". Mr Gardam said that the line-up was distinctive, and he attacked BBC1 and ITV for their programmes, saying: \"The future of quality television does not have to be two episodes of EastEnders sandwiching The Weakest Link.\"",

It was, he said, to make the Palestinians \"re-calibrate their calculations\". In other words, live bullets against stones might seem harsh, but it would save lives in the long run because, once the Palestinians saw the Israelis meant business, they would quickly back off. It didn't work out like that, though. Six weeks later, with more than 150 Palestinians dead, the officials have a different argument. Protecting the lives of Israeli soldiers must come first, and unfortunately, Israel does not have effective non-lethal methods for riot control, they say. It is remarkable that, in the 13 years since the outbreak of the first intifada, nobody in Israel has given much thought to riot control. However, according to the Israeli press, scientists are now hard at work developing slippery chemicals and sticky chemicals that, one day, may stop rioters in their tracks. The result, in the meantime, is that soldiers are protecting themselves by shooting Palestinians dead from distances of 650 or more - well beyond the reach of stone-throwers. Yesterday, the killing took a new turn, with the extra-judicial execution of Hussein Abayat, a Fatah activist - apparently with the blessing of prime minister Ehud Barak. Executing people without trial is bad enough, but executing them in the street, by a rocket fired from a helicopter, is even more appalling. The rocket also happened to execute two elderly Palestinian women nearby and injured 10 other people - a possibility that Mr Barak could reasonably have foreseen when approving the mission. Culpability for such actions does not lie just with the person who pulls the trigger. Under international law, a military commander or political leader can also be held responsible if he knew (or should have known) about the action and failed to prevent or punish it. Last week, a report by Amnesty International urged both sides in the conflict to show restraint, but reserved most of its criticism for the Israelis. \"There is a pattern of gross human rights violations that may well amount to war crimes,\" a spokesman said. A few weeks earlier, the Arab summit in Cairo also talked about war crimes and called for unnamed Israeli leaders to be put on trial. But are such trials a realistic possibility? I asked an international lawyer, who outlined five different legal routes, although none of them looks very promising. \u0095 Option 1: Israel and the Palestinian National Authority could agree to set up a war crimes tribunal, jointly. That, I think it's safe to say, is a non-starter. \u0095 Option 2: The United Nations Security Council could establish an ad hoc international criminal tribunal based on its powers to maintain international peace and security, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, as it did with Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. As a permanent member of the council, the United States has the right of veto and would almost certainly use it. \u0095 Option 3: The new International Criminal Court (see http://www.igc.apc.org/icc/) could take action, but the court will not become operational until 60 countries have ratified the Rome Statute which established it. Although the pace of signatures (115 so far) and ratifications (22) has been faster than expected, the statute is not expected to come into force until the end of 2001 or early 2002. Among the Arab League countries, despite their apparent enthusiasm for prosecuting Israelis, only Jordan, Kuwait, Sudan, Morocco, Djibouti and Comoros have got as far as signing, and none has ratified. The court could, however, become operational almost immediately if the 54 members of the Islamic Conference Organisation, who are, this weekend, holding a summit which will doubtless condemn Israel, collectively agreed to ratify it as soon as possible. One reason for the general reluctance is that the court is a double-edged sword. Once a country ratifies, its citizens become liable to be prosecuted in it. This naturally worries those leaders who have a shady past (or, in some cases, a shady present, too). Israel itself has not signed up, which would make prosecuting Israelis in the court difficult.

A few cases involving relatively unimportant people are, in fact, already under way in both Israel and the Palestinian territories, but, although both have occasionally investigated or prosecuted human rights abuses, neither side has much incentive to pursue them vigorously. Local prosecutions under international law could also be problematic for technical reasons. For example, the extent to which international law has been incorporated into Palestinian law is uncertain, and for historical reason, the parts of it that apply in Gaza may differ from those that apply in the West Bank. \u0095 Option 5: The Pinochet syndrome. Leaders who travel abroad could be arrested and prosecuted in other countries for torture, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Although approximately half the countries in the world are known to give their courts universal jurisdiction over one or more of such crimes, much of this legislation is defective. For example, not all crimes are included or their definitions are inconsistent with international law.

The prosecution of a major figure on, say, the Israeli side might easily lead tit-for-tat prosecutions on the other - and there are plenty of officials in the PLO and Syria, for example, who could find themselves in trouble. Prosecution, too, is mainly a way of showing public disapproval and exacting retribution, but it doesn't help the victims of crimes, especially when they're dead. Prevention would be a lot better. In the current situation - with little chance of an agreed ceasefire - the best hope for prevention may lie in establishing an international presence on the ground. But that is something the United States, Europe and Israel refuse to contemplate at present.

      "bodyText": "Police will form a massive exclusion zone around London to prevent fuel protesters in lorries from entering the centre of the capital, Scotland Yard said today. Lorry drivers campaigning for a cut in the fuel duty left Tyneside earlier today in a \"go-slow\" convoy expecting to arrive in London next week. Between 40 and 50 lorries and tractors left Birtley service station shortly after 9am. Initial estimates had suggested that hundreds of vehicles could be involved, but organisers struggled to determine which drivers were actually taking part in the demonstration and which were simply staying over at the truck stop. The convoy travelled first to Newcastle, causing major disruption in the city centre, before rejoining the A1 and travelling south to Leeds. Protesters are pressing ahead with the demonstration despite Chancellor Gordon Brown's \u00a31bn hand-out for the haulage industry in his pre-Budget speech on Wednesday. Northumbria Police have invoked powers under the Public Order Act 1986 to restrict the convoy to 100 lorries. The limit has only been imposed for the Newcastle section of the procession and will not prevent hundreds more joining elsewhere in the country. Organisers have complained of increasing friction between themselves and the police. A letter to the drivers said that the force recognises an individual's right to freedom of expression and assembly, as defined in articles 10 and 11 of the Human Rights Act. But it reminded the protestors that article two of the same act obliges the police to protect life and enforce the law. John Coxon, from the People's Fuel Lobby, said: \"We did have a good rapport with the police when we were demonstrating at Jarrow in September, but it seems that relationship has waned a little bit since then.\" Last week, civic leaders on South Tyneside urged the protesters not to start their convoy in Jarrow, as they feared it would tarnish the memory of the famous marchers who walked to London in the 1930s in their fight against poverty. The convoy will head for Manchester on Saturday, Stoke and Birmingham on Sunday, Northampton and Milton Keynes on Monday, before reaching the area around London on Tuesday. Transport minister Lord Macdonald urged those lorry drivers joining the demonstration to think again. \"It is running up to Christmas, the busiest time of the year for them, there is flooding around - we have got enough disruption around without adding to it,\" he said. Around a dozen environmental campaigners were at Birtley today making the case for higher fuel taxes. Tony Juniper, policy and campaigns director at Friends of the Earth, said that he had been trying to engage organisers in a debate ahead of today's planned convoy. Friends of the Earth intends to follow the protest around the country, calling for the retention of high fuel duties to prevent further global warming. \"We are here basically to try to widen the discussion away from the price of fuel so that we can talk about the longer-term costs to society of cheaper fuel,\" Mr Juniper said.

That was two vehicles down on what had set out at 30mph from Berwick on what had been billed as the truckers' answer to Gordon Brown, a go-slow that would bring the motorways to a standstill before a rally in Hyde Park on Tuesday. But protest organisers are hopeful that numbers will pick up today, as what they call the new Jarrow crusade formally kicks off near the Angel of the North outside Gateshead. Andrew Spence, one of the leaders of the People's Fuel Lobby, said there was nothing in Mr Brown's pre-budget statement on Wednesday to help farmers and hauliers now. \"The protest will go ahead as planned,\" he said. A Northumberland farmer, Charlie Armstrong, said he was expecting anything between six and 600 lorries to join the protest, while the fuel lobby vice-chairman Mark Francis predicted between 10 and 15 trucks would set off today. Mr Armstrong said the aim was not to cause disruption, but to get a \"gentle message across to the government\". North Yorkshire police defended their decision to take powers under the Public Order Act to bar the truckers from flood-stricken York, saying the force was \"extremely stretched\". The deputy chief constable, Peter Walker, said he \"always made sure people have the opportunity to make their point - just this once I am asking them to leave us to deal with the crisis\". John Pratt, a Farmers for Action leader, said the ban \"smacked of a police state\", but David Handley, chairman of the People's Fuel Lobby, said the protesters would respect it.

He did not seem to think that this grassroots fuel lobby had run out of gas.</p> <p>\"We have made some headway in so much as the chancellor addressed the fuel issue, and [it shows] that the government have admitted that they have got a problem,\" he said. \"We need to move on now from the schoolyard bickering and muck-throwing between government and protesters.\"</p> <p>He is less reactive, and certainly less reactionary, than some of his colleagues in the PFL. He is the counterbalance to its chairman David Handley, a militant farmer from south Wales who enjoys a spat with anyone from the government or with people he believes are new Labour.</p> <p>The PFL is a collection of hauliers, farmers and other protesters, headed by a seven-member committee. Mr Handley and Mr Francis, its effective leaders, are constantly on their mobile phones to each other, agreeing on tactics and hatching plans, but rarely meet.</p> <p>On the eve of the pre-budget statement, they sat down in a London restaurant with other committee members and, in high spirits, dismissed any talk of fractures in their movement.</p> <p>These men had come from nowhere and here they were, in the capital, making guest appearances on Newsnight and Kilroy and countless other programmes, and they were enjoying it. Their voice was being heard and they had no doubt that the government was beginning to listen.</p> <p>There was no big plan and \"no hidden agenda\". They would wait and see what Mr Brown had to offer.</p> <p>Some of those at the table have been involved in the group Farmers for Action. But before the pickets of oil refineries which almost crippled the country, Mr Francis and many others within the PFL were \"just your average blokes\". Mr Francis is operations manager at Bob Francis Crane Hire and Heavy Haulage, a north Wales company owned by his father which has 37 employees.</p> <p>His father was the first of the family to turn up at the Stanlow oil refinery in Ellesmere Port, and the son followed a few days later.</p> <p>After Brynle Williams, the figurehead of the protest, had gone home, Mark Francis found himself thrust into a position where he was checking the tankers' paperwork, and when it was suspected that unruly elements were about to cause trouble he was asked to address the crowd.</p> <p>\"After that there was no going back. My involvement with the protest suddenly escalated,\" he said. \"I have never been involved in anything like this before. I have never been on strike.\"</p> <p>Now, he said, he spoke for the nation, or the majority of it.</p> <p>The government had stopped listening, he said, but he was keen to point out that the protest was not aimed at this government but government in general.</p> <p>There would be no return to the barricades at the refineries. There would just be the so-called Jarrow convoy and a couple of rallies, including one in Hyde Park on Tuesday. The aim was not to cripple London but to make a point.</p> <p>\"I don't want the convoy to create mass chaos and pandemonium. We could have blockaded the refineries, and we could have had hand to hand combat with the police, but we don't want to do that.</p> <p>\"The convoy will travel at a safe and sensible speed. But we have got to create some sort of impact so that the government say, 'Bloody hell, they are here'.\"</p> <p>Mr Francis believes the real problem is not too many foreign hauliers. \"Everybody has jumped up and down and have said this fuel price has put us out of business - that's bullshit. The deep-rooted problem is over-population [in the British haulage industry].</p> <p>\"There are too many wagons on the road.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A mood of calm has descended on the nation's fuel protesters, or so says their deputy chairman, Mark Francis. The People's Fuel Lobby did not like what Gordon Brown's pre-budget statement had to offer them, but still they were \"happy\". Mr Francis said the mood within the group was one of confidence. He did not seem to think that this grassroots fuel lobby had run out of gas. \"We have made some headway in so much as the chancellor addressed the fuel issue, and [it shows] that the government have admitted that they have got a problem,\" he said. \"We need to move on now from the schoolyard bickering and muck-throwing between government and protesters.\" He is less reactive, and certainly less reactionary, than some of his colleagues in the PFL. He is the counterbalance to its chairman David Handley, a militant farmer from south Wales who enjoys a spat with anyone from the government or with people he believes are new Labour. The PFL is a collection of hauliers, farmers and other protesters, headed by a seven-member committee. Mr Handley and Mr Francis, its effective leaders, are constantly on their mobile phones to each other, agreeing on tactics and hatching plans, but rarely meet. On the eve of the pre-budget statement, they sat down in a London restaurant with other committee members and, in high spirits, dismissed any talk of fractures in their movement. These men had come from nowhere and here they were, in the capital, making guest appearances on Newsnight and Kilroy and countless other programmes, and they were enjoying it. Their voice was being heard and they had no doubt that the government was beginning to listen. There was no big plan and \"no hidden agenda\". They would wait and see what Mr Brown had to offer. Some of those at the table have been involved in the group Farmers for Action. But before the pickets of oil refineries which almost crippled the country, Mr Francis and many others within the PFL were \"just your average blokes\". Mr Francis is operations manager at Bob Francis Crane Hire and Heavy Haulage, a north Wales company owned by his father which has 37 employees. His father was the first of the family to turn up at the Stanlow oil refinery in Ellesmere Port, and the son followed a few days later. After Brynle Williams, the figurehead of the protest, had gone home, Mark Francis found himself thrust into a position where he was checking the tankers' paperwork, and when it was suspected that unruly elements were about to cause trouble he was asked to address the crowd. \"After that there was no going back. My involvement with the protest suddenly escalated,\" he said. \"I have never been involved in anything like this before. I have never been on strike.\" Now, he said, he spoke for the nation, or the majority of it. The government had stopped listening, he said, but he was keen to point out that the protest was not aimed at this government but government in general. There would be no return to the barricades at the refineries. There would just be the so-called Jarrow convoy and a couple of rallies, including one in Hyde Park on Tuesday. The aim was not to cripple London but to make a point. \"I don't want the convoy to create mass chaos and pandemonium. We could have blockaded the refineries, and we could have had hand to hand combat with the police, but we don't want to do that. \"The convoy will travel at a safe and sensible speed. But we have got to create some sort of impact so that the government say, 'Bloody hell, they are here'.\" Mr Francis believes the real problem is not too many foreign hauliers. \"Everybody has jumped up and down and have said this fuel price has put us out of business - that's bullshit. The deep-rooted problem is over-population [in the British haulage industry]. \"There are too many wagons on the road.\"",

As the US political system slips gently but effortlessly down the long hill, the most urgent thing to do is to stop its slide. Unless, like most of us, you secretly like watching disasters.

Total sales in the first quarter hit \u00a3110.3m, up 32% but the figures were flattered by the opening of 20 new pubs including Wetherspoon's first two in northern Ireland, at Belfast and Ballymena. The company plans to open in 100 new locations a year, increasing from its present 450 pubs.",

      "body": "<p>Andrew Dilnot, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the nation's oracle when it comes to tax and spending, is not much given to hyperbole. So when he says Gordon Brown's package for pensioners amounts to the biggest dose of redistribution in 20 years for a large group of the population his words carry weight. </p> <p>That the chancellor's largesse was greeted with a cautious welcome by pensioner groups is only to be expected because there was no surrender to their main demand, the restoration of the au tomatic link between the state pension and earnings growth. More interesting, perhaps, is that the other group which might have been expected to sit up and take notice at a big slug of redistribution - the City - could barely stifle its yawns. There was no run on the pound, no rush for the exit by those Harold Wilson dubbed the Gnomes of Zurich. </p> <p>A cynic might say that Brown has just been plain lucky. A sustained period of growth has meant the public finances are in amazingly good shape, so the financial markets are happy to turn a blind eye to a bit of old-fashioned redistribution. They might be less impressed should a domestic or a global downturn transform the government's hefty surplus into a deficit. In those circumstances, the chancellor's generosity could come back to haunt him. </p> <p>But let us not be too churlish. If the point of having a Labour government is that help should be given to those who need it most then Brown appears to be doing just that. If the price is that the chancellor has to be Janus-like and sweet talk the markets while he is doing it, then what's wrong with that? It is certainly preferable to promising a lot and delivering nothing. </p> <p><strong> Partly right </strong><br> </p> <p> So British Telecom stopped short of a full break-up and opted for a new Labour-esque third way: part flotations of its four business under the umbrella of a new holding company. </p> <p>Chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield is promising the best aspects of separation with the synergies of sitting inside a single group. But the consensus on a phoney break-up yesterday was \"too little too late\" and the share price, which BT had hoped to stimulate, simply fell further. </p> <p>Some of the troubles facing BT are outside its control; others are clearly of its own making. </p> <p>When Sir Peter Bonfield took control of BT, he notes, only 4% of revenues were from overseas. Yet the rush to make the business into a global player lacked strategy. Most telecoms companies of any size recognised some time ago that minority stakes in a patchwork of companies were not the way forward. </p> <p>That said, the company does now seem to be showing some humility and getting to grips with its debt, swollen by overstretching itself and the vast cost of third-generation mobile phone licences. </p> <p>It is easy to offer a knee-jerk reaction and say they should have gone further, yet part flotation has to be a step in the right direction. Exposing the separate divisions to outside investors should galvanise thinking at the four businesses and, at worst, dilute the bureaucratic culture of the parent company. </p> <p>It also frees them to use their own paper to make acquisitions. </p> <p>Similarly, scaling back its overseas ambitions by selling off most of its Asian assets makes sense. </p> <p>But there may be one important dividend for Sir Peter that has nothing to do with the City. He may have found a way of stopping newspapers from dividing annual profits by 525,600, dialling up a per-second earnings shocker. The sly man. </p> <p><strong> Ugly swan </strong><br> </p> <p> When Lord Sterling first talked about splitting Peninsular &amp; Oriental into cruise and \"other\" operations there were wild cheers from the City. At last we could stop calling it a conglomerate - a tag that stuck even after businesses such as Bovis Homes were jettisoned. </p> <p>Demerger promised real focus at a time when cruise stocks were riding high in New York. But no sooner had the break-up decision been made than investors began to fret that the ports and ferries side would be seen as an ugly duckling next to the beautiful cruise swan. The only thing that would keep the stock market interested in the remaining P&amp;O group would be the likelihood of a takeover, some analysts argued. </p> <p>What has happened since P&amp;O Princess Cruises was floated two weeks ago at 310p? Well, the price has plunged to 252p while the \"rump\" has soared - with no potential bidder to be seen. </p> <p>It is unlikely that P&amp;O would have performed better if it had not been demerged. But the timing of the demerger could not have been worse, with tons of new cruise capacity coming into the market. With the bungled float of the bulk shipping arm fresh in the memory, Lord Sterling looks accident-prone.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Dilnot, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the nation's oracle when it comes to tax and spending, is not much given to hyperbole. So when he says Gordon Brown's package for pensioners amounts to the biggest dose of redistribution in 20 years for a large group of the population his words carry weight. That the chancellor's largesse was greeted with a cautious welcome by pensioner groups is only to be expected because there was no surrender to their main demand, the restoration of the au tomatic link between the state pension and earnings growth. More interesting, perhaps, is that the other group which might have been expected to sit up and take notice at a big slug of redistribution - the City - could barely stifle its yawns. There was no run on the pound, no rush for the exit by those Harold Wilson dubbed the Gnomes of Zurich. A cynic might say that Brown has just been plain lucky. A sustained period of growth has meant the public finances are in amazingly good shape, so the financial markets are happy to turn a blind eye to a bit of old-fashioned redistribution. They might be less impressed should a domestic or a global downturn transform the government's hefty surplus into a deficit. In those circumstances, the chancellor's generosity could come back to haunt him. But let us not be too churlish. If the point of having a Labour government is that help should be given to those who need it most then Brown appears to be doing just that. If the price is that the chancellor has to be Janus-like and sweet talk the markets while he is doing it, then what's wrong with that? It is certainly preferable to promising a lot and delivering nothing. Partly right So British Telecom stopped short of a full break-up and opted for a new Labour-esque third way: part flotations of its four business under the umbrella of a new holding company. Chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield is promising the best aspects of separation with the synergies of sitting inside a single group. But the consensus on a phoney break-up yesterday was \"too little too late\" and the share price, which BT had hoped to stimulate, simply fell further. Some of the troubles facing BT are outside its control; others are clearly of its own making. When Sir Peter Bonfield took control of BT, he notes, only 4% of revenues were from overseas. Yet the rush to make the business into a global player lacked strategy. Most telecoms companies of any size recognised some time ago that minority stakes in a patchwork of companies were not the way forward. That said, the company does now seem to be showing some humility and getting to grips with its debt, swollen by overstretching itself and the vast cost of third-generation mobile phone licences. It is easy to offer a knee-jerk reaction and say they should have gone further, yet part flotation has to be a step in the right direction. Exposing the separate divisions to outside investors should galvanise thinking at the four businesses and, at worst, dilute the bureaucratic culture of the parent company. It also frees them to use their own paper to make acquisitions. Similarly, scaling back its overseas ambitions by selling off most of its Asian assets makes sense. But there may be one important dividend for Sir Peter that has nothing to do with the City. He may have found a way of stopping newspapers from dividing annual profits by 525,600, dialling up a per-second earnings shocker. The sly man. Ugly swan When Lord Sterling first talked about splitting Peninsular &amp; Oriental into cruise and \"other\" operations there were wild cheers from the City. At last we could stop calling it a conglomerate - a tag that stuck even after businesses such as Bovis Homes were jettisoned. Demerger promised real focus at a time when cruise stocks were riding high in New York. But no sooner had the break-up decision been made than investors began to fret that the ports and ferries side would be seen as an ugly duckling next to the beautiful cruise swan. The only thing that would keep the stock market interested in the remaining P&amp;O group would be the likelihood of a takeover, some analysts argued. What has happened since P&amp;O Princess Cruises was floated two weeks ago at 310p? Well, the price has plunged to 252p while the \"rump\" has soared - with no potential bidder to be seen. It is unlikely that P&amp;O would have performed better if it had not been demerged. But the timing of the demerger could not have been worse, with tons of new cruise capacity coming into the market. With the bungled float of the bulk shipping arm fresh in the memory, Lord Sterling looks accident-prone.",

It is a question which could now be raised with equal or greater force about the American empire which presidents inherit just as surely as they do the west wing, that extraordinary network, as Arthur Schlesinger Jr once put it, of \"troops, ships, planes, bases, proconsuls, local collaborators, all spread wide around the luckless planet\".</p> <p>This garrisoning of the world has become so familiar that it is barely noticed, at least by Americans, until some dramatic incident - a rape in Okinawa, an American aircraft cutting a cable-car wire at an Italian ski resort, or an attack on a US destroyer in a Yemen port - reminds us that it is there. Or, others would say, until it is needed, as it was in the Gulf or in Bosnia. What this empire is for, whether it is a force on balance for good or ill, or for what admixture of the two, whether the world could manage without it, and whether, in any case, it is sustainable these are issues which could be before America and the rest of us sooner than expected. They intertwine with more familiar issues like intervention, but are not the same.

But because it is usually slotted into particular pigeonholes, ranging from \"terrorism\" at one extreme to \"differences of policy\" at the other, the cumulative strength of that opposition may be underestimated. Those who oppose the American empire do so with varying degrees of anger. But even those who run it are troubled. Admiral Dennis Blair, until recently one of the four American military proconsuls who, as regional commanders in chief, divide up the world between them, told a Washington Post writer: \"What's the US going to do with its superpowerhood? It drives me crazy. We're looking at our wake instead of looking ahead.\"</p> <p>Blair's own position is indicative of how haphazardly American power evolves. The regional commanders in chief jobs were created, after some notable blunders, to ensure effective joint operations by the American services, but now underpin a quasi-independent military diplomacy in which American soldiers cultivate special relationships with governments and armed forces in \"their\" areas. These military chiefs, with large staffs and a budget which has grown like Topsy, certainly moderate policy and sometimes make it. They do so sometimes in opposition to elements in both the Pentagon and the State Department, and they have also sometimes taken a more liberal line on particular issues. It recalls the rivalries and \"rings\" of British imperial days, and is perhaps to be expected: where else but in an empire would empire building flourish ?</p> <p>A degree of incoherence arising from the existence of different power centres has always been evident in American foreign policy, but it may have got worse under Clinton, with Congress exerting greater influence as it reclaims its rights, as legislators see things, in international affairs. But, for critics and defenders of American empire alike, it is less the incoherence than the fragility of the structure that is the most obvious characteristic. Paul Kennedy identified the problem of \"overstretch\" many years ago in The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers. That book's cogent analysis of America's imperial problems was at first embraced, and then rather forgotten as the end of the cold war seemed to leave the US in a position of unprecedented strength. But, under Clinton, it has become clearer that America's empire has enormous reach but only limited punch.</p> <p>Militarily, it often seems perverse, favouring military solutions when they are wrong or inappropriate, but tending to duck them on the few occasions when they are required. Protection from communist threats no longer figures on the balance sheet for most countries. Yet the costs of the worldwide military presence are high and attempts to extract some of those costs from supposed beneficiaries - by way of payments for troops, by way of arms sales, by way of market advantages for the US - are frequently resented. The economic benefits that the American relationship was supposed to bring may always have owed more to local efforts than to American policy, and, after the Asian economic crisis, look far less certain.</p> <p>Politically, America's help in establishing or restoring democracy has been real enough in some places and at some times, yet often the reverse has been true. The big Asian democratic breakthroughs in South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia, for instance, came after years of US support of the undemocratic or quasi-democratic regimes that had gone before.</p> <p>The Japanese expert Chalmers Johnson, now a professor at the University of California, is the author of a comprehensive recent attack on American empire. His thesis, bolstered by his view that the Asian economic crisis was largely America's fault, is that America has been storing up trouble for itself - in particular in Asia. He calls this \"blowback\", a term which the Central Intelligence Agency first coined to describe the unintended consequences of American policies and activities, often covert ones. Blowback can be anything from a terrorist operation to a sudden refusal, after years of compliance, to go along with American requirements. It links both elite and popular resentments. \"The United States,\" he writes, \"now faces an agenda of problems that simply would not exist except for the imperial commitments and activities, open and covert, that accompanied the cold war.\" It has added to those problems, he further argues, by some of its policies in the post-cold war years.</p> <p>Blowback has a nice dramatic touch, but seems too catchall a category to explain as much as Johnson wants it to. His argument that the US should simply dismantle its empire has to be set beside Schlesinger's weary wisdom, which is that something like empire will always exist wherever there are stronger and weaker nations. Among those who do not wish to simply tear down the structures of American power, most have some attachment to it. That is because it is familiar, because they have seen it used for good as well as ill, and because nobody knows what life would be like without it.

Over 50 per cent of Pot Noodles are consumed by women, but the agency HHCL says that this is aimed more at fellas because \"it's a bigger eat\". Financial status: The \"snack\" only costs 99p, so you can fill yourself up for under a pound. Telling lifestyle detail: Chances are you're a student (Pot Noodles are extremely popular in student circles). You also probably don't have a very well-equipped kitchen - all you need to \"cook\" these things is a kettle. Other relevant data: The two actors were apparently cast because they have small hands, thus emphasising the giant size of the King Pot Noodle. And Big Dave's not that big either - it's just that the other bloke is really small.",

The measure, agreed late on Wednesday, followed an Argentine extradition request for the former dictator, who ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990. An ongoing investigation in Buenos Aires has named Gen Pinochet as a main suspect in the planning of a 1974 car bombing in the city which killed Carlos Prats, a Chilean army general, and a leading opponent of the dictator. Argentina wants to question Pinochet specifically about his role in the bombing. Prosecuting lawyers said that the Argentine extradition request was incomplete, but that once a fully certified order of arrest had arrived from Buenos Aires, supreme court judge Luis Correa Bulo would most probably order Gen Pinochet to be placed under house arrest. Since his return to Chile earlier this year, Gen Pinochet has been free to travel both in Chile and abroad - although numerous international warrants for his arrest limit the latter option. The supreme court-imposed travel restriction was seen as an immediate step towards cornering Gen Pinochet in Chile. Gen Pinochet received the news in a Santiago military hospital where he is allegedly fighting acute pneumonia.

The report, Through Other Eyes 2; How the world sees the United Kingdom, follows on from a similar exercise last year in which interviews took place in 13 other countries. One of the biggest changes is in the way young people obtain their information about Britain, with 21% finding out through the internet. Tony Blair is the best known Briton, followed by the Spice Girls (except in the Far East where they come top), Naomi Campbell, Hugh Grant and Kate Winslet. Eighteen per cent claimed to have heard of William Hague, a high recognition factor for someone not in office. Do they mean us?

As such he is the most tempting piece of flesh for the government's critics to take a bite from. Will they force him to resign? Lord Falconer, Charlie to his many friends in Whitehall and the legal bar, says he has no intention of falling on his sword. Mr Blair, who has known him since their teens, is standing by his man. But politics is littered with allies whom leaders had to discard to save their larger project - and themselves - when voters demanded a blood sacrifice to assuage their righteous anger. John Major threw over his chancellor, Norman Lamont. Mr Blair cast out Peter Mandelson, albeit only temporarily. Lord Falconer, 49 and a political novice in 1997, is not the only legitimate target for those who regard the Millennium Dome as a mismanaged and over-ambitious scheme. Assorted managers and board members at the New Millennium Experience Company who got the dome open - after a fashion - in time for New Year's Eve have also attracted flak. So do politicians of all parties and members of the great and good who sat on the millennium commission and encouraged the project. Michael Heseltine and Simon Jenkins, former editor of the Times, are easy, tempting targets. But genial Lord Falconer - Whitehall's sole shareholder on the NMEC board - remains the most tempting target. He did not start the project, and took it over only when Mr Mandelson, the original \"dome secretary\" (who took the portfolio with him when he went to the DTI) quit over his mortgage crisis in December 1998. Lord Falconer's offence is to ignore warnings that things were going badly wrong when the dome was trading below \"wildly optimistic\" expectation. He remained an optimist, at least in public. Unknown liabilities which surfaced later combined with poor income to doom the dome. Everyone who works with Lord Falconer agrees he is clever and hard-working. He devours paperwork and problem-solves for Mr Blair from his base in the Cabinet Office. All the same his lawyer talents, which serve him well in that capacity, do not make him a project manager, even at one remove, for a \u00a31bn scheme.

Heavy rain blocked roads in north Wales and the scenic tourist route of the Horseshoe Pass near Llangollen is expected to remain closed until after Christmas following landslips which carried away part of the road. The floods' secondary problem of sightseers brought a renewed warning from the environment agency at Worcester and York, where onlookers were accused of hampering rescue efforts and putting themselves in danger.",

Frederick Rutland, who won the Distinguished Service Order for daring low-level attacks on German cruisers during the Battle of Jutland in 1916, was initially recruited by Japan as an adviser on naval flying techniques. Papers released at the Public Record Office also show Japanese naval intelligence paid him to set up a spy base in Hawaii years before the surprise attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941. Rutland first came to the notice of MI5 in 1922 when he suddenly decided to end his glittering career and resign from the RAF. The agency received what it called \"reliable information\" from a \"very delicate source\" - known only as BJ - that the Japanese had secret talks with Rutland. MI5 noted that Rutland possessed \"unique knowledge of aircraft carriers and deck landings\". GCHQ, which had already broken Japanese naval codes, intercepted a string of communications to and from Japan's naval attache in London and naval intelligence headquarters in Tokyo. They paint a picture of an ineffective businessman and spy who continually haggled over money and expenses. In the 1920s he sailed with his wife and child to Japan where he apparently failed to land a job with Mitsubishi. \"Shinkawa\" - Rutland's code name - later travelled to the US. Intriguingly, given how the US was so surprised by Japan's attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941, the intercepts reveal that in 1935 Rutland told his Japanese spymasters that \"everyone\" he met in America \"thinks a war with Japan is inevitable, many even say it will be their way out of a depression\".

MI6 warned of the \"scandal which would be caused by the arrest of a former Air Force officer on charges of espionage ...\" MI5 made it clear that, in its view, Rutland should be arrested. There was no doubt that Rutland was a \"paid agent of the Japanese\", said a report signed by AF Blunt - the MI5 officer Anthony Blunt, who was later knighted for his work as surveyor of the Queen's pictures and exposed as a Soviet agent in 1979.

      "bodyText": "Kuwait said yesterday that it was holding three Arabs and was seeking a fourth on suspicion of plotting to attack American interests in the Gulf. An interior ministry statement said three Kuwaitis had been arrested and a north African man carrying a forged passport was still at large. It said the suspects had five hand grenades and 133kg of high explosives. A security source said the suspects were believed to be Islamists. Several other people who were earlier arrested had now been released. \"Out of all those investigated, so far only the three Kuwaitis and the north African are expected to face trial. They led authorities to where they had hidden their explosives and gave other information,\" the security official said. The newspaper Al-Qabas quoted a security source as saying that the suspects were linked to the Saudi fugitive Osama bin Laden, and had been planning \"a big operation\" inside Kuwait, as well as attacks on US targets elsewhere. The arrests came after the US, on a heightened state of alert because of \"credible\" but unspecified threats, tightened security around its troops in the region. US and British troops are deployed in Kuwait to enforce the no-fly zone over southern Iraq and to protect the tiny oil-rich state from perceived threats from Baghdad. About 5,000 American and 600 British troops live in Kuwait, as well as 8,000 American and 4,000 British civilians. Meanwhile, the US embassy in Yemen confirmed that American experts working to rid Yemen of its landmines had left the country, but gave no explanation. A Yemeni newspaper reported that they had left because of threats. More than 40 FBI agents, investigating last month's suicide attack on the warship USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden, recently left their hotel following threats and are now based offshore, travelling to the mainland by helicopter. Yemeni investigations into the Aden bombing have so far concentrated on local Islamists, though Iraq and Bin Laden have also been suggested as possible culprits. The inflatable which exploded alongside the warship is believed to have been packed with between 180kg and 320kg of C-4, a military explosive. Although C-4 is difficult to acquire, quantities have been stolen. Yemeni investigations suggest that planning of the Aden attack began at least six months ago - which would rule out a direct connection with the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It appears to have been motivated by a more general opposition to US involvement in the Middle East - which is often voiced by Islamist groups, especially in Yemen where the government has made a point of cultivating relations with the Americans. Most armed Islamist groups claim some connection with Bin Laden, though the links can be tenuous and usually arise out of contacts made during the Afghan war. They do not necessarily indicate Bin Laden's involvement in specific actions. Although early reports suggested the bombers must have acquired advance warning of the Cole's arrival, some Yemeni sources consider it more likely that they simply lay in wait for the first suitable target. The Yemeni authorities have rounded up more than 60 people for questioning, and about 10 are still believed to be held. Those questioned include police and officials at a local government office in Lahej, 25 miles north of Aden, where a false driving licence and other documents were issued to a man calling himself Abdullah Ahmed Khaled al-Musawah. He has been tentatively identified as one of the two who apparently killed themselves deliberately in the explosion. In a country where bribery is rife, the issuing of false papers does not necessarily imply a political motive on the part of the officials concerned.",

The attack also killed two elderly women bystanders,and at least 10 other people were injured. The Israeli army said the chilling attack represented a new policy of \"initiated\" activity against Mr Arafat's Fatah party militias, or tanzim. Decoded, that means the prime minister, Ehud Barak, has yielded to army commanders clamouring to abandon the policy of \"restraint\" which has guided the military during the past six weeks in which nearly 190 people have been killed, almost all Palestinian. Yesterday's attack came on the day Mr Arafat met President Clinton in Washington to demand an international protection force for the West Bank and Gaza. It also promises to extinguish whatever faint hopes there were of ending the killing any time soon, and returning Israel and the Palestinians to negotiations. In Beit Sahour, a wealthy Christian suburb of Bethlehem, witnesses said three helicopters circled persistently overhead before rocketing a forest green four-wheel drive vehicle almost simultaneously shortly after 10am.

Hours after the attack, a tow truck arrived, dumping the twisted heap of the Fatah men's car to the spot where it was struck, creating yet another grisly monument. After weeks of bloodshed, yesterday's assassination of a Fatah activist is bound to further inflame Palestinian anger, fuelling more stone throwing. \"This is an assassination against one of the Fatah leaders in Bethlehem district,\" said Marwan Barghouti, head of Fatah in the West Bank. \"I think this will push Fatah for a reaction.\" One man in the car, identified by local Palestinians as Hussein Abayat, was killed outright.

Palestinians described the married father of six as a baker. \"Hussein Abayt was a central tanzim terrorist activist in the area of Bethlehm and was a merchant of illegal weapons,\" said Major-General Itzhak Eitan, the army's commander in the West Bank. \"He was in possession of many weapons, among them the machine guns which he had used in many acts of terrorism.\" Mr Barak has been under increasing popular pressure of late to hit back hard against attacks on settlement in the Jerusalem area. During recent weeks, Israel has regularly shelled the villages of Beit Jalla and Beit Sahour, in punishing retaliatory attacks for gunfire directed at Gilo. Yesterday, Gen Eitan accused the Palestinian Authority of failing to stop attacks on Jewish settlements. He said he was unaware of the deaths of the two women, adding, \"I don't take responsibility for things I don't know.\" Useful links Madeleine Albright's office Yasser Arafat's office Ehud Barak's office Israeli government Moledet - Land of Israel Loyalty Party (Torah-based religious party) Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security) Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group) Organisation of Rabbis for the People of Israel Palestinian National Authority Egyptian presidency Hamas",

      "body": "<p>Ring Lardner Jr was, with Dalton Trumbo, the most talented of the so-called Hollywood Ten: the nine writers and one director who were imprisoned in the early 1950s for refusing to answer the anti-communist litmus-test question: \"Are you now, or have you ever been...?\" </p> <p>\"It is a very simple question,\" the chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee (Huac), J Parnell Thomas, told Lardner when he was summoned to testify in 1947. \"Any real American would be proud to answer it.\" </p> <p>\"Well,\" drawled a languid Lardner, \"I could answer it, sir, but if I did, I'd hate myself in the morning.\" It was one of the defining moments of the witch-hunt. Lardner, who died last week aged 85, was ejected before he could deliver his prepared statement. \"I think I'm leaving by force!\" quipped the Oscar-winning screenwriter of Woman of the Year as bailiffs shoved him out of the chamber. </p> <p>The next time he saw Thomas was in prison. In 1950, while Lardner and fellow Tenner Lester Cole were serving their time; Thomas was jailed alongside them for padding his Congressional payroll. The prisoners dubbed him \"Congressman Chickenshit\". </p> <p>If all this seems like ancient history, think again. The Huac hearings, the fate of the Ten, the witchhunts that served to eviscerate the Hollywood craft unions, the persistence of the blacklist throughout movies and TV well into the 1960s - all of it remains an open sore on Hollywood's conscience and its collective folk-memory. The rancour it still provokes is astonishing. </p> <p>Only three years ago, at a 50th anniversary commemoration of the Ten's appearance before Huac, the Hollywood studios finally made a collective apology for their craven acquiescence to the inquisition and the subsequent purge. That night Lardner finally got to read his 1947 statement, to resounding cheers. It was a bit late: of the Ten, only Lardner and Paul Jarrico were left, and Jarrico died the next day. </p> <p>A year later came the controversy over the lifetime achievement award presented to director Elia Kazan, who revolted his peers in 1952 by naming names to keep working. Rod Steiger remembered that learning of Kazan's capitulation \"was like finding out my father was sleeping with my sister\". Kazan has never apologised. And it was barely a year ago that the Academy belatedly restored writing credits to writers like Trumbo and Lardner, who had won Oscars for scripts written under fake identities. Or rather they hadn't won them, because at the time they were, in the land of the free, essentially Un-persons. Restitution took 50 years. The news was coolly received by two men and eight gravestones. </p> <p>Huac was indefensible, but that doesn't mean it's ever been short of defenders. The 1999 Kazan controversy prompted the formation of the eerily named Committee for Naming Facts, which supported Kazan and by association, the witchhunts themselves. That group was an offshoot of the Ayn Rand Institute, whose quasi-fascist founder herself made a memorable appearance before Huac as a friendly witness. Questioning the veracity of the wartime movie Mission to Moscow, she claimed that, unlike in the film: \"In Russia, under communism, the children never smile.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile the left fights tooth-and-nail to prevent the rehabilitation of the blacklist by the likes of William Buckley, who in his youth beseeched Evelyn Waugh to defend McCarthy in his National Review. Waugh told him to piss off, but Buckley persists even today. \"There were no heroes, only victims,\" was Trumbo's verdict. </p> <p>But there were also victors, politicians like Richard Nixon, who made his national reputation as a Huac committee member, as did Robert Kennedy - \"a McCarthyite tough\" in the words of his lifelong enemy, Gore Vidal. Ronald Reagan sold out his own union, the Screen Actors' Guild, by acquiescing to the blacklist with evangelical enthusiasm. The Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals was a headlong rush to the scaffold, the torchlit last reel of a Frankenstein movie - a pro-witchhunt, pro-blacklist group headed by the likes of John Wayne, Ward Bond (one of my very favourite actors, sadly), Gary Cooper, King Vidor, Victor Fleming, and Hedda Hopper, bitch-goddess of the mid-century fame game. </p> <p>And there were the losers: the suicides, the exiles, people hounded out of work. Actor John Garfield drank himself to death because, as a friend said: \"He was a guy from the streets, and he couldn't bear the idea of people in his neighbourhood yelling, 'There's the fuckin' stoolie!' Sterling Hayden, in a dilemma no one should ever have to face, named names after learning that custody of his children would be awarded to his mentally ill ex-wife if he didn't. He drank a lot after that, too. Can you blame him? </p> <p>Could it happen again? Probably not, but it's worth bearing in mind that the nine writers who went to jail were not just some loose affiliation of, in the accusatory terminology of the day, \"premature anti-fascists\". They were the nine most active founders of the Screenwriters' Guild, the first effective, craftsman-controlled union to establish itself in Tinseltown. When they were jailed, the union was eviscerated and swiftly co-opted. So if the Writers' Guild fights rough in its May 2001 contract negotiations with studios and networks, it can cite some grim precedents to back it up.</p>",

Bush aides also told journalists to expect an announcement concerning the appointment of Colin Powell, a former four-star general and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff who is tipped for the job of secretary of state.</p> <p>The focus on international affairs represented an extraordinary and deliberate display of self confidence on Mr Bush's part, at a time when world attention was focused on the intricacies and accidents of Florida's balloting practices.</p> <p>Earlier visitors included Andy Card, a former lobbyist for the motor industry who was transportation secretary for Mr Bush's father, and who is now tipped to be chief of staff in a new Bush White House.</p> <p>Dick Cheney, the vice-presidential candidate and former president George Bush's defence secretary, was put in charge of assembling the transition team which is supposed to pave the way for a smooth transfer of power in January.</p> <p>When it came to choosing a tough political operator to go to Florida to promote George Bush's interests in the ballot recount, the campaign turned to James Baker, who served as secre tary of state and confidant to the candidate's father.</p> <p>During the campaign, Governor Bush made as much effort to keep a distance from his father, as Al Gore did to stay away from Bill Clinton, especially after the elder Mr Bush referred to George W affectionately as his \"boy\" in an early campaign rally. But the governor's early, and possibly premature, appointments added weight to critics who said his election would amount to a Bush restoration.</p> <p>Several observers also remarked on a change in Governor Bush's body language. When he emerged from the mansion on Wednesday to speak to reporters, he seemed to be making a deliberate effort to carry himself in a different manner from Bush the candidate.</p> <p>His shoulders were held back and square, with none of his trademark shrugging. Also missing was his characteristic smirk. He spoke softly and calmly, using the sort of language normally reserved for victory speeches, thanking his opponent's supporters (who outnumbered his own across the country) for \"their hard work and their belief in their cause\".</p> <p>\"We feel very good about what our title will be in a couple of days,\" he said.</p> <p>In the town of Crawford, Texas, where the Bush family owns a ranch, the local Baptist pastor, Mike Murphy, made no such assumptions.</p> <p>The sign outside his church was amended yesterday morning to read: \"Home of President George W Bush. Maybe.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "While votes were still being counted in Florida yesterday, George W Bush adopted a presidential demeanour, summoning members of a \"transition team\" to the Texas governor's mansion to plan his move to the White House. As the hours went by, the heavy iron gates at the mansion occasionally swung open for limousines carrying prospective members of a government team which showed strong signs of being a continuation of the last Bush administration, run by the governor's father. Condoleezza Rice, a foreign policy adviser to the elder Bush, arrived in the morning to discuss the foreign policy team and possibly her future as national security adviser. Bush aides also told journalists to expect an announcement concerning the appointment of Colin Powell, a former four-star general and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff who is tipped for the job of secretary of state. The focus on international affairs represented an extraordinary and deliberate display of self confidence on Mr Bush's part, at a time when world attention was focused on the intricacies and accidents of Florida's balloting practices. Earlier visitors included Andy Card, a former lobbyist for the motor industry who was transportation secretary for Mr Bush's father, and who is now tipped to be chief of staff in a new Bush White House. Dick Cheney, the vice-presidential candidate and former president George Bush's defence secretary, was put in charge of assembling the transition team which is supposed to pave the way for a smooth transfer of power in January. When it came to choosing a tough political operator to go to Florida to promote George Bush's interests in the ballot recount, the campaign turned to James Baker, who served as secre tary of state and confidant to the candidate's father. During the campaign, Governor Bush made as much effort to keep a distance from his father, as Al Gore did to stay away from Bill Clinton, especially after the elder Mr Bush referred to George W affectionately as his \"boy\" in an early campaign rally. But the governor's early, and possibly premature, appointments added weight to critics who said his election would amount to a Bush restoration. Several observers also remarked on a change in Governor Bush's body language. When he emerged from the mansion on Wednesday to speak to reporters, he seemed to be making a deliberate effort to carry himself in a different manner from Bush the candidate. His shoulders were held back and square, with none of his trademark shrugging. Also missing was his characteristic smirk. He spoke softly and calmly, using the sort of language normally reserved for victory speeches, thanking his opponent's supporters (who outnumbered his own across the country) for \"their hard work and their belief in their cause\". \"We feel very good about what our title will be in a couple of days,\" he said. In the town of Crawford, Texas, where the Bush family owns a ranch, the local Baptist pastor, Mike Murphy, made no such assumptions. The sign outside his church was amended yesterday morning to read: \"Home of President George W Bush. Maybe.\"",

      "body": "<p>I cannot recall how my obsession with Hitchcock started; it goes back almost far enough to qualify as an original sin. But there is a specific date that solemnised the affair. One afternoon in 1961, aged all of 13, I lost my virginity at a screening of Psycho. Strictly speaking, it was only my innocence I lost. The technical loss came later, but you spend so long preparing for it - rehearsing the scenes in your head, starting with a jerky silent movie to which you gradually add dialogue - that by the time the occasion arrives, it is probably anti-climactic. Your graduation from innocence to experience occurs when the feverish business of imagining begins, and for me, this raid on a forbidden knowledge will always be associated with Psycho. During my first under-age exposure to the film, the images that thrilled me were those of trespass and guilty surveillance. This, surely, was why the cinema existed: to depict what you were not supposed to be looking at. </p> <p>An aerodynamic peeping Tom hovers above a city, which drowses in the early-afternoon sun. The people in those faceless boxes are presumably working, or eating their lunch. No, not all of them. The camera, nosing the air suspiciously, swoops towards a certain window on an upper floor of a hotel, nudges the sill and sidles into the room, blinking at the contrast with the glare outside. The couple it spies on think they are safe from scrutiny because they are so high above street level, which is why they have left the blind half-lowered. Here, for a 13-year-old, was a first small and easily soluble mystery: why are they undressed at this time of day? </p> <p>Psycho starts post-coitally, and leaves the preliminaries to be scripted by us. In 1961, when the world was still blissfully ignorant, you had to work harder. Hitchcock supplied hints, or brief glimpses. Knowing us only too well, he left us to design our own private storyboards. Later comes a view even more privileged than the mid-air assault on the hotel room. Through a peephole drilled in a wall at the motel, there is a momentary sight - curtailed just in time - of a woman unpeeling her bra. </p> <p>By the end of the film, worked up into a state of high excitement, we are ready to imagine what Hitchcock does not even bother to show us. In the house on the hill, another explorer picks up a leather-bound book that has no title on its ornately-tooled spine. She opens it, and her eyes imperceptibly widen. We are not allowed to see what she has seen. Robert Bloch, in the novel that Hitchcock adapted, offers no particular help, merely confiding that the illustrations clamped inside the covers are \"almost pathologically pornographic\". It is a dare. When I became familiar with Hitchcock himself, after watching him eerily editorialising on his television series, I could hear his grave, glutinous voice mutter in a clinical description of the book's contents; but that was later, once my capacity to fantasise had come up to speed. Meanwhile, there beside a rumpled, tormented bed in the same room on the screen, was a collection of obsolete toys: a brutalised doll, a rabbit with a wilted ear - the relics of someone else's lost childhood. </p> <p>On its long journey across the Pacific to Australia, and then on its second, even more tantalising trip from the mainland to the island state of Tasmania where I was born, Psycho had acquired an unwholesome reputation. We had just completed a decade of satisfied suburban niceness and compulsory normality. Since the prosperity of the 50s seemed too good to be true, no questions were to be asked, for fear that the illusion of affluent content might be revoked. My parents, having lived through a depression and a world war, were grateful for this oblivion. My own generation was bound to challenge it - and Hitchcock offered an early inducement. </p> <p>How normal was Norman Bates, who, according to the psychiatrist in Robert Bloch's Psycho, enjoys an extra identity as Norma, inhabiting the stuffy persona and musty clothes of his own mother? An officious aunt warned my parents to ban me from seeing the film. \"It's too hot for his blood,\" she said. Westerns were thought appropriate, because the violence in them offered a training in virility. But Psycho dealt with seamier matters, about which the grown-ups went into whispered conclave. The moralistic aunt claimed to know of someone who had already seen it in Sydney. He hadn't been able to sleep for a week afterwards, suffered screaming fits, and finally needed a prescription from the doctor. \"And he,\" she said, \"was a naval man!\" That, supposedly, should have immunised him. </p> <p>As it happened, there was no need for a parental embargo. The censors saw to this, branding the film with an M. That stood for Mature, which made Psycho all the more enticing. It was, as I soon enough found out, a film about ripening - and also about rotting. I was sure, consulting the physical evidence, that I could pass as mature. But, according to the aunt, you had to prove mental maturity as well, before they'd sell you a ticket; otherwise you risked permanent harm. In advance, Psycho had come to resemble a rite of passage, a visceral, constricted tunnel you had to pass through to get from one age to the next. Ingmar Bergman once imagined the breathless foreboding of those who buy tickets for a film - the audience, collectively tensed, says to itself: \"Here I am, seated in the darkness, and, like a woman about to give birth, I want deliverance.\" Allowing for the transposition of sexes, that was what I required from Psycho. It was to be my blooding; a death from which I might, if I was lucky, recover, since the actual blood would be shed on my behalf by others - a woman whose body is slashed in a shower, a man whose brain is punctured as he climbs a staircase. </p> <p>The week before Psycho arrived in town, I began to plan my strategy. The censor's certificate precluded a children's matinee on Saturday, and I was not allowed out of the house at night. What choice did I have? Playing truant from school, I intended to see it on a weekday afternoon. I would break the law, and tell lies to cover my trail. It was a life-changing decision. I was already behaving, if I had only known it, like the heroine of the film, who - after her own sweaty matinee in the hotel bedroom - asks her boss's permission to go home early. She then drives briskly out of town with the $40,000 he has given her to deposit at the bank. She feigns a headache: a feminine ailment, inappropriate for adolescent boys. Toothache was the excuse I chose, and I dramatised its onset when I bit into a lunchtime sandwich. Excused from school for the rest of the day, I wondered whether I might not have strayed into perilous territory. If acts had immediate consequences, as we were always being told by those who dosed us with the Bible, wasn't I goading one of my own teeth to ache? It might have made a neatly retributive plot for an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, but in fact my teeth behaved themselves throughout the afternoon. The episode counted as one of my earliest and most valuable moral experiments, investigating how much it was possible to get away with. </p> <p>I stuffed my school cap and blazer into the satchel that contained my books, and left it in the town library. The few blocks between there and the cinema had their dangers, like a snipers' alley. Ours was a small town, and I might have run into the invigilating aunt. Janet Leigh, after all, is spotted by her boss when she pauses at the traffic lights on her way out of Phoenix. To be 13 and at large so soon after lunch was itself an admission of guilt, like being an able-bodied civilian in wartime. Head down, I made it. </p> <p> The cinema was called the Avalon; its name evoked chivalry and medieval enchantments, bravely defying the trams that clattered past and the odour of meat pies and pungent tomato sauce from the shop next door. A grim brick chapel stood opposite it, frowning. The lobby, to my surprise, was not barricaded against me. Shouldn't there have been barbed wire, or officials demanding the presentation of documents? In America, they had apparently hired guards to marshal the queues of ticket-holders, and played tapes of Hitchcock explaining why no one was allowed to enter the theatre after a screening of Psycho had begun. I almost expected an improvised infirmary for those who allegedly staggered out at the end, their nerves shredded. But, so far as I could see, no ambulance was standing by. </p> <p>I cannot remember the rest of the experience without turning it into an anthology of Hitchcock clips, abbreviated excerpts from films I had not yet seen. The lobby elongated as I walked across it: an expressionistic camera trick, like the swooning zoom that opens a crevasse beneath James Stewart in Vertigo. Then there was the box office where a suspicious attendant behind the grille might call the police, which happens when Cary Grant - on the lam, like me - tries to buy a train ticket at Grand Central station in North by Northwest. Instead, a bored teenage girl glanced idly at me. Did I dry up, like Gregory Peck when he faces the ticket clerk at Pennsylvania station in Spellbound? </p> <p>All he can blurt out is an absurd request for a ticket to Rome. What I said, I suppose, is: \"One, please.\" Determined to cast off childhood, I did not ask for a child's discount. I got my ticket without trouble - but, as Joan Fontaine discovers in Rebecca when she bypasses the rusty, overgrown gate of Manderley, dreamers have an agility denied to those who remain awake, and can vault over obstacles. I was soon inside, in the darkness where the revelation, lit by a lunar beam from the projector, was due to occur. </p> <p>Psycho did not disappoint me. I may not have understood all I saw, but I knew that taboos were being breached. What I didn't know was that Hitchcock omitted a few of the scabrous sights and thoughts with which Bloch's novel regales us. In the book, Norman tells himself not to make mental pictures of certain bodily parts, even though in erasing the images he admits the imagining he has already done. \"Mother's thighs were dirty. Mustn't look,\" he says. Likewise he pointedly \"never thought about Mother's breasts\". When he transports his querulous parent to the fruit cellar, he reminds her that there's a pot for her use. \"Norman,\" she croaks, \"must you talk that way?\" Despite these repressions, the film gave me plenty to think about. </p> <p>After that first glimpse of avid tussling in a cheap hotel came the examination of a bathroom. For the first time in a film, someone flushed a toilet (though an incriminating scrap of paper, stained with a sum, remained behind in the bowl). There were confrontations, when I managed to unclench my eyes and look, with what ought to have remained invisible. Here was the featureless mask of an avenging deity: the traffic cop, inscrutable behind his dark glasses, or the shadowed figure with the slicing knife. At last I saw the face of death, leathery-skinned and laughing, with cavities where the eyes once were. I had been handed a psychological agenda for maturity, supplied with a lifetime's worth of bad dreams. I was definitely no longer innocent. </p> <p>I retrieved my disguise as a schoolboy from the library cloakroom and went home by bus. I looked out of the back window in case a visored cop on a motorcycle should happen to be closing in, ready to arrest me for truancy or for knowing too much. Guilt, I discovered, is like a back-projection in a film: a nocturne in broad, indifferent daylight, cast on a blank screen. You can see it, because you are inside the trauma. Who else can? The sun still blandly shone, and objects beside the road were healthily flushed with colour, despite Psycho's bleached ceramic tiles and its muddy, heaving swamp. At home, our bathroom had only ordinary tales to tell: a comb with snagged teeth, the razor I would one day (as the maturing proceeded) have to scrape across my face, a Plimsoll line of soap scum around the tub. </p> <p>But when I used the shower next morning, I found that it too had lost its innocence. The plastic curtain squealed in alarm when tugged on its metal rod. Hot icicles of water felt like needles, or dental drills. And the plughole, although the water swirled in a different direction in our hemisphere, announced that your life was leaking away even as you got yourself ready for another day at school. </p> <p>Hitchcock took particular pleasure, I later learned, in estranging people from their bathrooms, which before Psycho were resorts of impregnable privacy, closets or cloisters where puritans purged themselves. He once claimed to have received a letter from a mother and father who blamed him for their daughter's insanitary state. Ever since seeing Henri-Georges Clouzot's Les Diaboliques, where the murderers drown their victim in a tub, she had refused to take a bath. Now, having been to Psycho, she flinched from the shower too. Hitchcock suggested that they should send her out to be dry-cleaned. It was an old joke, freshly adapted to America, where your clothes at least could be cleansed without immersion in water. </p> <p>In Blackmail, the first of Hitchcock's British talking pictures, a London gossip - a woman whose stale face powder and flustered perspiration you can almost smell - prattles on in a shop about a local stabbing, unaware that the heroine has committed the crime. The case reminds her, she says, of a recent murder where the man was drowned in his tub. For a month, she was too frightened to have a bath; then for weeks after that she wouldn't go beyond a rinse-down. Listening, you tighten your nostrils in sympathy with the other customers in the shop. </p> <p>Psycho infected me - and how many others? - with a mistrust of motels, which institutionalise our transitoriness. Even in hotels, I tread carefully in case I step on the nail-clippings of former occupants, embedded in the carpet piles, and try not to notice stray hairs in the bathtub. Surely the maids protest too much when they place those paper seals on the toilet seat, pretending that you have had no predecessors. The terrors are not confined to the bathroom. In Hitchcock's films, the most innocuous object can rear up threateningly. What could possibly be sinister about the record of Beethoven's Eroica, which Vera Miles finds on a gramophone turntable during her investigation of the Bates house? At the age of 13, I had no idea - though I felt an unmistakable chill when the camera peered into the gaping box to read the label of the silent disc. Now I think I know the answer. </p> <p>The symphony summarises one abiding undercurrent of Hitchcock's work. It is about Napoleon, a man who - like many of Hitchcock's psychopaths - set himself up as a god, and it includes a funeral march for the toppled idol. It first rejoices in the hero's freedom from moral inhibitions, then recoils in dismay. Truffaut, detecting unease beneath the joviality of The Trouble with Harry, suggested that Hitchcock's films were afflicted by the mood Blaise Pascal analysed - \"the sadness of a world deprived of God\". </p> <p>Gradually I came to understand Hitchcock's surreal genius: he knew how to rescind reality, and to make you afraid. \"I brought you nightmares,\" whispers Joseph Cotten as the wicked uncle in Shadow of a Doubt, pleased to have upset a soporific town not unlike the one I lived in. Other founding fathers had higher-minded hopes for the new art of film. DW Griffith set out to make heaven visible from the lowly earth, and Chaplin's tramp mutely appealed to the brotherhood of man. Hitchcock, however, was no evangelist. He wanted to frighten us. Those who consider themselves invulnerable call this trivial or childish; to me, fear is the most rational response to existence, and the most reverent tribute to its irrationality. </p> <p>I caught sight of Hitchcock once, while he was filming Frenzy in London's Covent Garden market during the summer of 1970. A crowd of technicians and anachronistic cockney porters surged around the buttoned-up blob in the sagging canvas chair. This unmoved mover hardly seemed to be directing; he just lumpily sat there and watched other people do things - mostly carting bags of vegetables, one of which might have contained a dead body. By then he did not need to bestir himself. He had succeeded in deliciously terrorising the world; and all of us, whether within the camera's range or not, were acting in the nightmare he had devised. </p> <p>Having once been let out to play, the demons refuse to retire indoors. They prefer to take part in murderous charades, quoting Psycho with triumphant bravado. In 1998, the BBC paid OJ Simpson for a television interview. He indignantly insisted that he had not slaughtered his wife and her friend, then addressed a sideways smirk to the camera. Parting from the interviewer, Ruby Wax, he said he had a surprise for her, and promised to deliver it later. When the bell rang, she opened the door of her hotel room. There loomed OJ, his arm raised, emitting a series of staccato shrieks: he was tunelessly winging Bernard Herrmann's score for the shower scene in Psycho, with its fraught strings, while he lowered his arm to stab her. His weapon? Not Mrs Bates's knife, but a banana purloined from one of the hotel's hospitality baskets. </p> <p>I had already performed my own version of this scene on a return visit to my parents in Australia. The episode did not quite follow Hitchcock's storyboard. I was in the shower one morning when I heard a fumbling at the bathroom door. Surely, I thought, the sound of running water safeguarded my privacy; but the door opened, and a shape positioned itself on the other side of the translucent curtain. A hand reached up, the curtain squeaked, and so (I am ashamed to say) did I. It was my father who stood there, neatly reversing roles for both of us. He held not a knife but a pair of over-sized carrots that he had dug up in his vegetable garden. Their tips were jagged, and he kept a strangling grip on their green top knots. They might have been a brace of downed game birds. </p> <p>He blinked, even more startled than I was. \"I thought it was your mother,\" he said; it seems he wanted to show her his carrots. At the time I remember wondering why that couldn't wait. The disinterred vegetables hadn't even shaken off their shroud of dirt. Now the incident seems touchingly matrimonial, proof of the intimacy my parents enjoyed with one another but not with me. I tugged the curtain back into place, and I suppose he took his carrots to the bedroom. </p> <p> No blood was spilled, but I'm not sure that there was a happy ending. My father, who never saw Psycho, died soon afterwards. Those few seconds in the shower were as frank a conversation as we ever had. I still shudder when I think of it, and the chill is supernatural, like the fear that Hitchcock induces. For the ancient Greeks, the symptoms - prickling skin, an involuntary shock - warned that you were in the vicinity of a god. My parents explained such sensations according to their own more or less pagan theology. Someone, they used to say, is walking over your grave. And where, I always asked myself, might that resting place be? Psycho offered a choice: the white tub, so easy to scrub clean, or the black, gluttonous bog that gobbled cars and the bodies buried in them. Or, if you preferred, the cellar in which the fruit matured. </p> <p>At the Universal studios theme parks in Los Angeles and Orlando, a facsimile of the Psycho set is a place of pilgrimage. The queues for admission to the traumatic bathroom are always long. Visitors line up to borrow Mrs Bates's smock and her hairnet, which come in all sizes. Suitably attired, you are then issued with a rubber knife and directed to slash a Universal studios intern, who modestly showers in a body stocking. </p> <p>The duplication on opposite coasts recognises a ravenous public demand. Everyone, it seems, has spent some time at the Bates motel - or would like to do so. On arrival, a film we know by heart assigns us our moves. After depositing our worldly goods in a cabin, we go for a stroll. There is only one route to take, since the set ends just out of the viewfinder's range. Inevitably, we climb the path towards the family home on the hill. Of course it has a different use nowadays. That ghoulish house, with the silhouetted body in the window like a figure at a magic-lantern show, is a cinema. Inside it, we are licensed to dream. </p> <p>\u0095 Taken from The Hitchcock Murders by Peter Conrad, published by Faber &amp; Faber Ltd on 20 November at \u00a316.99. \u00a9 Peter Conrad 2000</p>",

It might have made a neatly retributive plot for an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, but in fact my teeth behaved themselves throughout the afternoon. The episode counted as one of my earliest and most valuable moral experiments, investigating how much it was possible to get away with. I stuffed my school cap and blazer into the satchel that contained my books, and left it in the town library. The few blocks between there and the cinema had their dangers, like a snipers' alley. Ours was a small town, and I might have run into the invigilating aunt. Janet Leigh, after all, is spotted by her boss when she pauses at the traffic lights on her way out of Phoenix. To be 13 and at large so soon after lunch was itself an admission of guilt, like being an able-bodied civilian in wartime. Head down, I made it. The cinema was called the Avalon; its name evoked chivalry and medieval enchantments, bravely defying the trams that clattered past and the odour of meat pies and pungent tomato sauce from the shop next door. A grim brick chapel stood opposite it, frowning. The lobby, to my surprise, was not barricaded against me. Shouldn't there have been barbed wire, or officials demanding the presentation of documents? In America, they had apparently hired guards to marshal the queues of ticket-holders, and played tapes of Hitchcock explaining why no one was allowed to enter the theatre after a screening of Psycho had begun. I almost expected an improvised infirmary for those who allegedly staggered out at the end, their nerves shredded. But, so far as I could see, no ambulance was standing by. I cannot remember the rest of the experience without turning it into an anthology of Hitchcock clips, abbreviated excerpts from films I had not yet seen. The lobby elongated as I walked across it: an expressionistic camera trick, like the swooning zoom that opens a crevasse beneath James Stewart in Vertigo. Then there was the box office where a suspicious attendant behind the grille might call the police, which happens when Cary Grant - on the lam, like me - tries to buy a train ticket at Grand Central station in North by Northwest. Instead, a bored teenage girl glanced idly at me. Did I dry up, like Gregory Peck when he faces the ticket clerk at Pennsylvania station in Spellbound? All he can blurt out is an absurd request for a ticket to Rome. What I said, I suppose, is: \"One, please.\" Determined to cast off childhood, I did not ask for a child's discount. I got my ticket without trouble - but, as Joan Fontaine discovers in Rebecca when she bypasses the rusty, overgrown gate of Manderley, dreamers have an agility denied to those who remain awake, and can vault over obstacles. I was soon inside, in the darkness where the revelation, lit by a lunar beam from the projector, was due to occur. Psycho did not disappoint me. I may not have understood all I saw, but I knew that taboos were being breached. What I didn't know was that Hitchcock omitted a few of the scabrous sights and thoughts with which Bloch's novel regales us. In the book, Norman tells himself not to make mental pictures of certain bodily parts, even though in erasing the images he admits the imagining he has already done. \"Mother's thighs were dirty. Mustn't look,\" he says. Likewise he pointedly \"never thought about Mother's breasts\". When he transports his querulous parent to the fruit cellar, he reminds her that there's a pot for her use. \"Norman,\" she croaks, \"must you talk that way?\" Despite these repressions, the film gave me plenty to think about. After that first glimpse of avid tussling in a cheap hotel came the examination of a bathroom. For the first time in a film, someone flushed a toilet (though an incriminating scrap of paper, stained with a sum, remained behind in the bowl). There were confrontations, when I managed to unclench my eyes and look, with what ought to have remained invisible. Here was the featureless mask of an avenging deity: the traffic cop, inscrutable behind his dark glasses, or the shadowed figure with the slicing knife. At last I saw the face of death, leathery-skinned and laughing, with cavities where the eyes once were. I had been handed a psychological agenda for maturity, supplied with a lifetime's worth of bad dreams. I was definitely no longer innocent. I retrieved my disguise as a schoolboy from the library cloakroom and went home by bus. I looked out of the back window in case a visored cop on a motorcycle should happen to be closing in, ready to arrest me for truancy or for knowing too much. Guilt, I discovered, is like a back-projection in a film: a nocturne in broad, indifferent daylight, cast on a blank screen. You can see it, because you are inside the trauma. Who else can? The sun still blandly shone, and objects beside the road were healthily flushed with colour, despite Psycho's bleached ceramic tiles and its muddy, heaving swamp. At home, our bathroom had only ordinary tales to tell: a comb with snagged teeth, the razor I would one day (as the maturing proceeded) have to scrape across my face, a Plimsoll line of soap scum around the tub. But when I used the shower next morning, I found that it too had lost its innocence. The plastic curtain squealed in alarm when tugged on its metal rod. Hot icicles of water felt like needles, or dental drills. And the plughole, although the water swirled in a different direction in our hemisphere, announced that your life was leaking away even as you got yourself ready for another day at school. Hitchcock took particular pleasure, I later learned, in estranging people from their bathrooms, which before Psycho were resorts of impregnable privacy, closets or cloisters where puritans purged themselves. He once claimed to have received a letter from a mother and father who blamed him for their daughter's insanitary state. Ever since seeing Henri-Georges Clouzot's Les Diaboliques, where the murderers drown their victim in a tub, she had refused to take a bath. Now, having been to Psycho, she flinched from the shower too. Hitchcock suggested that they should send her out to be dry-cleaned. It was an old joke, freshly adapted to America, where your clothes at least could be cleansed without immersion in water. In Blackmail, the first of Hitchcock's British talking pictures, a London gossip - a woman whose stale face powder and flustered perspiration you can almost smell - prattles on in a shop about a local stabbing, unaware that the heroine has committed the crime. The case reminds her, she says, of a recent murder where the man was drowned in his tub. For a month, she was too frightened to have a bath; then for weeks after that she wouldn't go beyond a rinse-down. Listening, you tighten your nostrils in sympathy with the other customers in the shop. Psycho infected me - and how many others? - with a mistrust of motels, which institutionalise our transitoriness. Even in hotels, I tread carefully in case I step on the nail-clippings of former occupants, embedded in the carpet piles, and try not to notice stray hairs in the bathtub. Surely the maids protest too much when they place those paper seals on the toilet seat, pretending that you have had no predecessors. The terrors are not confined to the bathroom. In Hitchcock's films, the most innocuous object can rear up threateningly. What could possibly be sinister about the record of Beethoven's Eroica, which Vera Miles finds on a gramophone turntable during her investigation of the Bates house? At the age of 13, I had no idea - though I felt an unmistakable chill when the camera peered into the gaping box to read the label of the silent disc. Now I think I know the answer. The symphony summarises one abiding undercurrent of Hitchcock's work. It is about Napoleon, a man who - like many of Hitchcock's psychopaths - set himself up as a god, and it includes a funeral march for the toppled idol. It first rejoices in the hero's freedom from moral inhibitions, then recoils in dismay. Truffaut, detecting unease beneath the joviality of The Trouble with Harry, suggested that Hitchcock's films were afflicted by the mood Blaise Pascal analysed - \"the sadness of a world deprived of God\". Gradually I came to understand Hitchcock's surreal genius: he knew how to rescind reality, and to make you afraid. \"I brought you nightmares,\" whispers Joseph Cotten as the wicked uncle in Shadow of a Doubt, pleased to have upset a soporific town not unlike the one I lived in. Other founding fathers had higher-minded hopes for the new art of film. DW Griffith set out to make heaven visible from the lowly earth, and Chaplin's tramp mutely appealed to the brotherhood of man. Hitchcock, however, was no evangelist. He wanted to frighten us. Those who consider themselves invulnerable call this trivial or childish; to me, fear is the most rational response to existence, and the most reverent tribute to its irrationality. I caught sight of Hitchcock once, while he was filming Frenzy in London's Covent Garden market during the summer of 1970. A crowd of technicians and anachronistic cockney porters surged around the buttoned-up blob in the sagging canvas chair. This unmoved mover hardly seemed to be directing; he just lumpily sat there and watched other people do things - mostly carting bags of vegetables, one of which might have contained a dead body. By then he did not need to bestir himself. He had succeeded in deliciously terrorising the world; and all of us, whether within the camera's range or not, were acting in the nightmare he had devised. Having once been let out to play, the demons refuse to retire indoors. They prefer to take part in murderous charades, quoting Psycho with triumphant bravado. In 1998, the BBC paid OJ Simpson for a television interview. He indignantly insisted that he had not slaughtered his wife and her friend, then addressed a sideways smirk to the camera. Parting from the interviewer, Ruby Wax, he said he had a surprise for her, and promised to deliver it later. When the bell rang, she opened the door of her hotel room. There loomed OJ, his arm raised, emitting a series of staccato shrieks: he was tunelessly winging Bernard Herrmann's score for the shower scene in Psycho, with its fraught strings, while he lowered his arm to stab her. His weapon? Not Mrs Bates's knife, but a banana purloined from one of the hotel's hospitality baskets. I had already performed my own version of this scene on a return visit to my parents in Australia. The episode did not quite follow Hitchcock's storyboard. I was in the shower one morning when I heard a fumbling at the bathroom door. Surely, I thought, the sound of running water safeguarded my privacy; but the door opened, and a shape positioned itself on the other side of the translucent curtain. A hand reached up, the curtain squeaked, and so (I am ashamed to say) did I. It was my father who stood there, neatly reversing roles for both of us. He held not a knife but a pair of over-sized carrots that he had dug up in his vegetable garden. Their tips were jagged, and he kept a strangling grip on their green top knots. They might have been a brace of downed game birds. He blinked, even more startled than I was. \"I thought it was your mother,\" he said; it seems he wanted to show her his carrots. At the time I remember wondering why that couldn't wait. The disinterred vegetables hadn't even shaken off their shroud of dirt. Now the incident seems touchingly matrimonial, proof of the intimacy my parents enjoyed with one another but not with me. I tugged the curtain back into place, and I suppose he took his carrots to the bedroom. No blood was spilled, but I'm not sure that there was a happy ending. My father, who never saw Psycho, died soon afterwards. Those few seconds in the shower were as frank a conversation as we ever had. I still shudder when I think of it, and the chill is supernatural, like the fear that Hitchcock induces. For the ancient Greeks, the symptoms - prickling skin, an involuntary shock - warned that you were in the vicinity of a god. My parents explained such sensations according to their own more or less pagan theology. Someone, they used to say, is walking over your grave. And where, I always asked myself, might that resting place be? Psycho offered a choice: the white tub, so easy to scrub clean, or the black, gluttonous bog that gobbled cars and the bodies buried in them. Or, if you preferred, the cellar in which the fruit matured. At the Universal studios theme parks in Los Angeles and Orlando, a facsimile of the Psycho set is a place of pilgrimage. The queues for admission to the traumatic bathroom are always long. Visitors line up to borrow Mrs Bates's smock and her hairnet, which come in all sizes. Suitably attired, you are then issued with a rubber knife and directed to slash a Universal studios intern, who modestly showers in a body stocking. The duplication on opposite coasts recognises a ravenous public demand. Everyone, it seems, has spent some time at the Bates motel - or would like to do so. On arrival, a film we know by heart assigns us our moves. After depositing our worldly goods in a cabin, we go for a stroll. There is only one route to take, since the set ends just out of the viewfinder's range. Inevitably, we climb the path towards the family home on the hill. Of course it has a different use nowadays. That ghoulish house, with the silhouetted body in the window like a figure at a magic-lantern show, is a cinema. Inside it, we are licensed to dream. \u0095 Taken from The Hitchcock Murders by Peter Conrad, published by Faber &amp; Faber Ltd on 20 November at \u00a316.99. \u00a9 Peter Conrad 2000",

It is expected to develop nationwide next year and extend to doctors and other health professionals. </p> <p>Earlier this week the government signed a deal to recruit up to 5,000 nurses from Spain to relieve shortages in English hospitals, pending the recruitment and training of 20,000 extra nurses envisaged in the NHS plan. But ministers think a more effective short-term solution can be found by helping the NHS's existing workforce to work when they want and where they want. </p> <p>A Department of Health source said too many nurses were forced by inflexible rostering to quit the NHS and work for private agencies that were less well regulated and charged commission for placing the same staff back with the NHS.

      "bodyText": "The government is about to set up a nursing supply agency inside the NHS to provide tens of thousands of staff with opportunities for overtime or part time working to suit their family responsibilities. Tony Blair will today announce the founding of NHS Professionals to compete with private agencies that cost the health service \u00a3361m last year. The organisation will start with an experimental scheme for placing nurses, midwives and health visitors in London, Essex, Bristol and Birmingham, the areas of greatest staff shortages. It is expected to develop nationwide next year and extend to doctors and other health professionals. Earlier this week the government signed a deal to recruit up to 5,000 nurses from Spain to relieve shortages in English hospitals, pending the recruitment and training of 20,000 extra nurses envisaged in the NHS plan. But ministers think a more effective short-term solution can be found by helping the NHS's existing workforce to work when they want and where they want. A Department of Health source said too many nurses were forced by inflexible rostering to quit the NHS and work for private agencies that were less well regulated and charged commission for placing the same staff back with the NHS. Under the new scheme, nurses can ask NHS Professionals to find them working hours that suit their lifestyles and earnings needs. The new organisation - based on a successful experiment in west Yorkshire - will offer holiday pay, pension entitlements and compensation to temporary staff if shifts are offered but later cancelled. \"Crucially it will allow us to maintain and update the professional skills that these nurses have. This will provide a guarantee of quality for nurses working on short term or irregular contracts for the NHS,\" the source said. In 1996-97 the government spent \u00a3191.5m on agency nurses, midwives and health visitors working for the NHS in England. Last year this increased to \u00a3361.5m and the audit commission has forecast a further steep rise this year. The Royal College of Nursing estimates that at least a fifth of Britain's 300,000 nurses work overtime - either through private agencies or nursing \"banks\" run by individual NHS trusts. A spokeswoman welcomed the plan. \"This reflects just how deep the shortages are, but the NHS agency should drive up standards and that is good news for nurses and patients,\" she said. Mr Blair will launch the plan at a conference of chief nursing officers in Brighton. He is expected to blame cuts in nurse training between 1992 and 1995 for the shortages.",

      "body": "<p>When they finally write the history of this presidential election, the key names in the story could be those of Al Gore, George W Bush - and Theresa LePore.</p> <p>Ms LePore is the superviser of elections for Florida's Palm Beach county. It is a place where the population mushroomed at the end of the 20th century, an affluent area which attracted tens of thousands of retirees from the north-eastern US, lured by the sun and the absence of income tax. A lot are Jewish, most are Democrats and, for many of them, their eyesight is not what it once was.</p> <p>It was Ms LePore who decided that the ballot paper in Tuesday's presidential election in the county needed to be rearranged so elderly voters could read the names of candidates more easily. With 10 names to cram on the ballot, she decided that two pages would be better than one, and rearranged the ballot paper so that the two pages meshed with one another.</p> <p>It was by far the biggest blunder of a series of Florida ballot irregularities and mysteries that have thrown the entire presidential election into chaos. It was a decision which led to 19,000 spoiled ballot papers being thrown into the bin on Tuesday night. And with them may have gone Al Gore's claim to the White House.</p> <p>On the left-hand page of the ballot, Mr Bush's name appeared at the top, with Mr Gore's name below it. On the right-hand page, just between the two, was Pat Buchanan's name. This meant that although Mr Gore's name was second on the list, the hole which voters were required to punch to vote for him was the third from the top, below the holes for Mr Bush and Mr Buchanan.</p> <p>Ms LePore showed her redesign to the two other people on the local canvassing board which supervises the county's elections, Carol Roberts and Judge Charles Burton. Both approved it for use on Tuesday. She showed it to representatives of the parties too. None objected.</p> <p><b> Despair</b><br></p> <p>It was a decision which may have decided the fate of US presidency, to say nothing of the health care prospects of millions of Americans, the right of women to have a legal abortion, the possibility of reform to the campaign finance jungle and the future of international nuclear weapons agreements, among others.</p> <p>As a result of the confusion, thousands of voters in Palm Beach county did what they would not normally do. They voted for Pat Buchanan's rightwing, anti-Israeli, isolationist programme. When they realised their mistake, some punched a second hole on the ballot paper, invalidating their votes.</p> <p>In Florida yesterday, the local newspapers and the airwaves were full of people in despair over what they had done.</p> <p>\"I would have voted for anyone but Buchanan,\" said Andre Fladell, a chiropractor from Delray Beach, who is one of several local voters preparing to take the issue to the courts. \"When I left, I thought it was me, and I thought I had been careless. As I spoke to other people and I saw the ballot again, I realised I got suckered.\"</p> <p>\"I voted for Buchanan instead of Gore,\" said Siggy Flicker of Boca Raton. \"I am Jewish and Lieberman is running, but I made the mistake. I was so humiliated and embarrassed and felt so stupid.\" Irma Fleischman from West Boca, who attended a rally on Wednesday where affidavits were being collected from people who say they voted incorrectly, added: \"In a community like this, most people are very liberal Democrats. None of them would have ever voted for Buchanan.\"</p> <p>In Palm Beach county, 3,407 people voted for Mr Buchanan, more than three times the number that voted for him in any other of Florida's 67 counties.

      "bodyText": "When they finally write the history of this presidential election, the key names in the story could be those of Al Gore, George W Bush - and Theresa LePore. Ms LePore is the superviser of elections for Florida's Palm Beach county. It is a place where the population mushroomed at the end of the 20th century, an affluent area which attracted tens of thousands of retirees from the north-eastern US, lured by the sun and the absence of income tax. A lot are Jewish, most are Democrats and, for many of them, their eyesight is not what it once was. It was Ms LePore who decided that the ballot paper in Tuesday's presidential election in the county needed to be rearranged so elderly voters could read the names of candidates more easily. With 10 names to cram on the ballot, she decided that two pages would be better than one, and rearranged the ballot paper so that the two pages meshed with one another. It was by far the biggest blunder of a series of Florida ballot irregularities and mysteries that have thrown the entire presidential election into chaos. It was a decision which led to 19,000 spoiled ballot papers being thrown into the bin on Tuesday night. And with them may have gone Al Gore's claim to the White House. On the left-hand page of the ballot, Mr Bush's name appeared at the top, with Mr Gore's name below it. On the right-hand page, just between the two, was Pat Buchanan's name. This meant that although Mr Gore's name was second on the list, the hole which voters were required to punch to vote for him was the third from the top, below the holes for Mr Bush and Mr Buchanan. Ms LePore showed her redesign to the two other people on the local canvassing board which supervises the county's elections, Carol Roberts and Judge Charles Burton. Both approved it for use on Tuesday. She showed it to representatives of the parties too. None objected. Despair It was a decision which may have decided the fate of US presidency, to say nothing of the health care prospects of millions of Americans, the right of women to have a legal abortion, the possibility of reform to the campaign finance jungle and the future of international nuclear weapons agreements, among others. As a result of the confusion, thousands of voters in Palm Beach county did what they would not normally do. They voted for Pat Buchanan's rightwing, anti-Israeli, isolationist programme. When they realised their mistake, some punched a second hole on the ballot paper, invalidating their votes. In Florida yesterday, the local newspapers and the airwaves were full of people in despair over what they had done. \"I would have voted for anyone but Buchanan,\" said Andre Fladell, a chiropractor from Delray Beach, who is one of several local voters preparing to take the issue to the courts. \"When I left, I thought it was me, and I thought I had been careless. As I spoke to other people and I saw the ballot again, I realised I got suckered.\" \"I voted for Buchanan instead of Gore,\" said Siggy Flicker of Boca Raton. \"I am Jewish and Lieberman is running, but I made the mistake. I was so humiliated and embarrassed and felt so stupid.\" Irma Fleischman from West Boca, who attended a rally on Wednesday where affidavits were being collected from people who say they voted incorrectly, added: \"In a community like this, most people are very liberal Democrats. None of them would have ever voted for Buchanan.\" In Palm Beach county, 3,407 people voted for Mr Buchanan, more than three times the number that voted for him in any other of Florida's 67 counties. Even Mr Buchanan thought yesterday that that was far more than he should have got. \"I don't want votes that were not intended for me,\" he said. But the really jaw-dropping figure was the number of ballot papers from Palm Beach that had to be discarded because they were punched twice. Ms LePore's office confirmed that 19,120 ballot papers were invalidated because of this error on Tuesday night. In the US Senate election in the county, only 3,783 people made a similar mistake. Yesterday, Ms LePore was crestfallen and apologetic. \"I'll never use facing pages like that again. I was trying to make the ballot more readable for our elderly voters. I was trying to do a good thing.\" The complaints about Palm Beach county were at the centre of a series of planned legal challenges against the con duct of the election which could eventually lead to a fresh ballot in parts of the state, or even in the whole of Florida. Florida is no stranger to such lawsuits and reruns. The election for Miami's mayor had to be rerun as recently as 1998 after complaints of fraud. Large numbers of non-US voters - overwhelmingly Cubans - tried to take part in the original poll. The argument about irregularities like those in Palm Beach county mounted as Florida continued to carry out a quite separate recount after Tuesday's election showed Mr Bush just 1,784 votes ahead of Mr Gore in an electorate of 6m. Even when the recount is completed, the final result will not be officially declared until November 17, because overseas postal votes can still qualify until then, providing that they are postmarked on or before election day, November 7. Most of the overseas postal votes are thought to come either from military voters stationed overseas, or from Florida residents currently in Israel. Although Florida's elections division director, Clay Roberts, said yesterday that a ballot box that was apparently left behind in one Dade county precinct on election might - and widely shown on national television - contained no ballots but only election supplies such as marker pens, irregularities alleged to have taken place in Florida's poll include: \u0095Intimidation of voters: In Woodville, outside Tallahassee, civil rights workers said that the Florida highway patrol set up a drivers' licence checkpoint near the local polling station, and charged that its purpose was to pressure black voters into staying away from the polls. A third of the local population in Woodville is black. A spokesman for the highway patrol denied the allegation and said that the officers handed out 13 tickets to white motorists and six to blacks. A poll watcher for the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People in Hillsborough County near Tampa said a police deputy posted out side a polling station asked black men for identification and turned them away after checking police records. \u0095Address changes: One of the most widespread complaints was that voters who turned up with evidence of their changes of address were not allowed to vote because supervisors were unable to obtain authorisation from electoral authorities. This is normally a standard procedure for which telephone authorisation is regularly given, but lines were jammed across the state. \"I got through once, at 7.30 in the morning,\" said Nat Rothenburg, a poll supervisor in Lauderhill, where 500 voters were turned away. \"I felt so bad for these people who wanted to vote.\" Hazel Bostwick added: \"I had clerks pulling out their hair because they couldn't get through.

      "bodyText": "The \"two strikes and you're out\" law which requires judges to pass a life sentence for a second serious offence, even if they regard the sentence as unjust, was effectively neutralised by the court of appeal yesterday in a landmark human rights judgment. Three judges, headed by Lord Woolf, the lord chief justice, used new powers under the Human Rights Act, which came into force last month, to restore the discretion judges had before the law was passed in 1997. Lawyers said the judgment would lead to a rash of appeals by prisoners sentenced to life under the provision. The automatic life sentence for a second serious offence was a cornerstone of the Conservative government's \"tough on crime\" policy. The 1997 Crime (Sentences) Act laid down that judges must impose a life sentence on anyone convicted of a range of offences - including attempted murder, rape, manslaughter, wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent, and robbery with a real or imitation firearm - if the offender had previously been convicted of another offence on the list. Only if there were \"exceptional circumstances\" could a judge pass a lesser sentence, but this had to be interpreted strictly. It was not enough that a judge thought a life sentence unjust in the circumstances. Judges spoke out against the legislation during its parliamentary passage. Yesterday, in a test case involving five prisoners, the appeal court used the powers under the Human Rights Act which allow judges to interpret legislation so as to make it compatible with the European convention on human rights. They ruled that in \"exceptional circumstances\" judges could take into account whether the offender was a danger to the public. If not, they could pass a lesser sentence. That effectively puts the law back as it was before the Crime (Sentences) Act was passed. The judges could instead have held that that act was incompatible with the human rights convention. But they decided not to take that step, which would have left it to parliament to bring in new legislation compatible with the convention. \"The norm is that those who commit two serious offences are a danger or risk to the public,\" said Lord Woolf. \"If in fact, taking into account all the circumstances relating to a particular offender, he does not create an unacceptable risk to the public, he is an exception to this norm.\" In such cases a life sentence would not be justified. The judges cut life sentences passed on two of the prisoners to three years, upheld the other two and ruled that the fifth, who had been given a 12-year sentence because of exceptional circumstances, should be jailed for life instead. Mathew Offen, 36, a bungling building society robber with an inadequate personality, who was held to present no significant risk to the public, was already free on bail and had his life sentence reduced to three years. For the same reason, a three-year term was substituted for life in the case of Darren McKeown, 27, convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent after kicking a man once in the head in a confrontation over the purchase of a ring. An appeal by Peter McGilliard, 37, against his life sentence for wounding with intent was dismissed because his previous record and pre-sentence reports indicated he was a serious and continuing danger to the public. The judges also rejected an appeal by Kristova Okwuegbunam, 33, against his life term for the manslaughter of the mother of his children in an incident that involved \"a strong element of bullying and humiliation\". He constituted a significant risk, they said. In the fifth case, the court allowed a challenge by the attorney general to an \"unduly lenient\" 12-year sentence on a man, 41, for rapes committed over a number of years against his two daughters. He was jailed for life because of the continuing danger he presented. John Wadham, director of the civil rights organisation Liberty said: \"Fixed sentences are wrong in principle.

He said it had always been the case that if the income failed to materialise from ticket sales the dome would automatically be bailed out by the commission. \"Therefore it would not be a case of the dome becoming insolvent.\" He said it was new information about unknown liabilities that came out in the PricewaterhouseCoopers investigation into the accounts in September that made clear the dome was insolvent. The report is a damning indictment of all the people involved in the dome, pointing out that the 12m visitor target was too ambitious and there was no proper financial accountability or control. The three top civil servants responsible for the dome will be summoned before the Commons public accounts committee next Wednesday to explain the fiasco. The Tory leader, William Hague, last night called for Lord Falconer to resign. He added that the dome should be closed down.",

      "body": "<p>If Europe is to achieve a position in keeping with its role in history it cannot just remain a trading community for states, with glaring social differences. If Europe wants to go on keeping the peace, upholding social justice, freedom, citizen's rights, while maintaining a balanced environment and overall stability, it is not enough just to accept new countries. It must work to achieve even greater integration of its members.</p> <p>To achieve this, Europe must have its own constitution. I am quite convinced that a constitution will not contribute in any way to making \"Eurocrats\" stronger. On the contrary it is necessary, indeed essential, for Europe to serve its peoples and cultures.</p> <p>There should be two sides to a European constitution. First, Europeans must agree on the direction that they want their life in the community to take. They must decide which values are fundamental, the linchpins of everything that characterise a common European identity - from the promises of peace and economic unity expressed by the fathers and mothers of Europe, to the guarantee of a welfare state. This agreement would be a sort of Magna Carta, a European statement of fundamental values and rights. This charter should be more daring and inventive than the one we are offered at present.</p> <p>Second, Europe needs a plan explaining how the project is to work. If we do nothing to change the current situation the principle of unanimous agreement, the role of the council of the European Union, or council of ministers, the rule determining the number of commissioners (which cannot exceed a certain limit without paralysing the work of the commission), the role of the European parliament and the court of justice - we will run straight into a dead end.</p> <p>A draft constitution could be produced between now and 2005, just before we welcome new member states. Indeed it is absolutely essential, for without structural changes, the European Union, which is already in trouble, would be quite unable to cope with the arrival of new countries.</p> <p>But how can Europe move forward? How can it avoid paralysis? Does it really stand a chance of carrying off this project successfully? I would suggest the following approach: legislative power in Europe could be invested in two chambers - the first would be the European parliament, elected directly by the people of Europe. The legislative authority of this body would be such that it could debate and decide all the issues affecting European interests -but no more than that. In other words, the principle of subsidiarity would be upheld and anything that did not fall within the scope of its authority would be the responsibility of national or regional assemblies. There can be no exceptions to this rule.</p> <p>We know from experience that politicians have an unfortunate tendency to overstep their prerogatives. There must therefore be some way of holding them in check. A second chamber should, I believe, be able to provide this control. The members of the second chamber would not be elected by direct suffrage, but selected from representatives of national and regional assemblies. Like the US Senate, this chamber should be based on a system of equal rather than proportional representation, not directly related to the size of the population of each country. Its main job would be to represent the interests of the various member states.</p> <p>The two assemblies are not designed to represent national governments. On the contrary they would comprise members of national or regional assemblies elected directly by the people. Not only would this situation enhance their democratic legitimacy, but also it would encourage electors to identify with their representatives. In its capacity as the repository of judicial power and the guardian of the European constitution, the European court of justice must affirm its position as the guardian of EU construction. In particular it should ensure that both assemblies comply with their constitutional prerogatives and it should protect citizens' rights.</p> <p>In this way European government could play a prominent role. It could concentrate on truly European issues, rather than being hemmed in by national interests. This would be the real difference between the Europe of tomorrow and what we see today. At present the council of ministers is the de facto government of the EU. But the council is just a body representing national interests! This is made possible by a fable, according to which ministers defend national interests against an invisible intruder called \"Europe\". In fact they are the only actors in this farce. For example, complex, potentially problematic decisions - such as agricultural policy - are taken by the council. Ministers return home after summit meetings and explain that \"Brussels\" has once again taken some unreasonable decision.</p> <p>A commission, with more extensive powers, should take over from the council. But it will need to think along truly European lines. It will have to break out of a system under which policy is decided to suit individual states andstart to serve Europe as a whole. This change will require radical reforms, to ensure that commissioners are no longer the delegates of national governments. In terms of legitimacy it is not enough just to be appointed. Commissioners must also have genuine democratic authority. The government of Europe must also stop concentrating on exclusively administrative issues and fulfil a political function. A powerful, active government of this kind, acting in the name of common European interests and with the same standing as national governments, or perhaps even greater importance, needs to be approved by the citizens of Europe. This could be achieved in two ways.</p> <p>The president of the commission could be elected by universal suffrage. This system could involve the election of an electoral college representing the various member states on a proportional basis. The US example is worth considering in this context. The authority of the president has a democratic basis. He or she has no say in the affairs of individual states, but is empowered to take decisions on foreign policy, security, the environment and social policy.</p> <p>Alternatively, a proportional vote could be organised using transnational, European electoral registers. At the European elections, people would have two votes, one for the members of the European parliament, the other for the president of the commission.</p> <p>In this way the leader of the party polling the largest number of votes would become the EU president. After consulting the council of ministers, the president could form a government, the seat of executive power, and ask the European parliament for its approval.</p> <p>For me, Europe is a vision, a dream, perhaps even one of the few remaining forms of Utopia for which it is still worth fighting. I am convinced that the notion of \"constitutional patriotism\" - to borrow an expression used by J\u00fcrgen Habermas about Germany - has considerable significance in the case of Europe. Deliberate, shared support for the principles and rules laid down in the constitution could unite Europeans and forge a sense of identity.</p> <p>I am consequently convinced that the debate on the constitution, and the voting it would involve, are essential steps in the process of building a new Europe. The discussions, in which I hope everyone will take part, can only contribute to promoting greater awareness and political identification. In this respect I am a European, indeed a constitutional \"patriot\".</p> <p>Daniel Cohn-Bendit is a Green member of the European parliament. This is extracted from an article in Le Monde.

I am quite convinced that a constitution will not contribute in any way to making \"Eurocrats\" stronger. On the contrary it is necessary, indeed essential, for Europe to serve its peoples and cultures. There should be two sides to a European constitution. First, Europeans must agree on the direction that they want their life in the community to take. They must decide which values are fundamental, the linchpins of everything that characterise a common European identity - from the promises of peace and economic unity expressed by the fathers and mothers of Europe, to the guarantee of a welfare state. This agreement would be a sort of Magna Carta, a European statement of fundamental values and rights. This charter should be more daring and inventive than the one we are offered at present. Second, Europe needs a plan explaining how the project is to work. If we do nothing to change the current situation the principle of unanimous agreement, the role of the council of the European Union, or council of ministers, the rule determining the number of commissioners (which cannot exceed a certain limit without paralysing the work of the commission), the role of the European parliament and the court of justice - we will run straight into a dead end. A draft constitution could be produced between now and 2005, just before we welcome new member states. Indeed it is absolutely essential, for without structural changes, the European Union, which is already in trouble, would be quite unable to cope with the arrival of new countries. But how can Europe move forward? How can it avoid paralysis? Does it really stand a chance of carrying off this project successfully? I would suggest the following approach: legislative power in Europe could be invested in two chambers - the first would be the European parliament, elected directly by the people of Europe. The legislative authority of this body would be such that it could debate and decide all the issues affecting European interests -but no more than that. In other words, the principle of subsidiarity would be upheld and anything that did not fall within the scope of its authority would be the responsibility of national or regional assemblies. There can be no exceptions to this rule. We know from experience that politicians have an unfortunate tendency to overstep their prerogatives. There must therefore be some way of holding them in check. A second chamber should, I believe, be able to provide this control. The members of the second chamber would not be elected by direct suffrage, but selected from representatives of national and regional assemblies. Like the US Senate, this chamber should be based on a system of equal rather than proportional representation, not directly related to the size of the population of each country. Its main job would be to represent the interests of the various member states. The two assemblies are not designed to represent national governments. On the contrary they would comprise members of national or regional assemblies elected directly by the people. Not only would this situation enhance their democratic legitimacy, but also it would encourage electors to identify with their representatives. In its capacity as the repository of judicial power and the guardian of the European constitution, the European court of justice must affirm its position as the guardian of EU construction. In particular it should ensure that both assemblies comply with their constitutional prerogatives and it should protect citizens' rights. In this way European government could play a prominent role. It could concentrate on truly European issues, rather than being hemmed in by national interests. This would be the real difference between the Europe of tomorrow and what we see today. At present the council of ministers is the de facto government of the EU. But the council is just a body representing national interests! This is made possible by a fable, according to which ministers defend national interests against an invisible intruder called \"Europe\". In fact they are the only actors in this farce. For example, complex, potentially problematic decisions - such as agricultural policy - are taken by the council. Ministers return home after summit meetings and explain that \"Brussels\" has once again taken some unreasonable decision. A commission, with more extensive powers, should take over from the council. But it will need to think along truly European lines. It will have to break out of a system under which policy is decided to suit individual states andstart to serve Europe as a whole. This change will require radical reforms, to ensure that commissioners are no longer the delegates of national governments. In terms of legitimacy it is not enough just to be appointed. Commissioners must also have genuine democratic authority. The government of Europe must also stop concentrating on exclusively administrative issues and fulfil a political function. A powerful, active government of this kind, acting in the name of common European interests and with the same standing as national governments, or perhaps even greater importance, needs to be approved by the citizens of Europe. This could be achieved in two ways. The president of the commission could be elected by universal suffrage. This system could involve the election of an electoral college representing the various member states on a proportional basis. The US example is worth considering in this context. The authority of the president has a democratic basis. He or she has no say in the affairs of individual states, but is empowered to take decisions on foreign policy, security, the environment and social policy. Alternatively, a proportional vote could be organised using transnational, European electoral registers. At the European elections, people would have two votes, one for the members of the European parliament, the other for the president of the commission. In this way the leader of the party polling the largest number of votes would become the EU president. After consulting the council of ministers, the president could form a government, the seat of executive power, and ask the European parliament for its approval. For me, Europe is a vision, a dream, perhaps even one of the few remaining forms of Utopia for which it is still worth fighting. I am convinced that the notion of \"constitutional patriotism\" - to borrow an expression used by J\u00fcrgen Habermas about Germany - has considerable significance in the case of Europe. Deliberate, shared support for the principles and rules laid down in the constitution could unite Europeans and forge a sense of identity. I am consequently convinced that the debate on the constitution, and the voting it would involve, are essential steps in the process of building a new Europe. The discussions, in which I hope everyone will take part, can only contribute to promoting greater awareness and political identification. In this respect I am a European, indeed a constitutional \"patriot\". Daniel Cohn-Bendit is a Green member of the European parliament. This is extracted from an article in Le Monde.

Critics of the president say that he has used the fund as a front to launder payoffs.</p> <p>The allegations have led to widespread calls for Mr Estrada's resignation or impeachment. Next week the house of representatives is expected to prepare articles of impeachment, which are expected to be sent swiftly to the senate for a trial.</p> <p>Mr Estrada has been stepping up efforts to rally the urban working class on his side against an opposition which he claims is \"anti-poor\".

      "bodyText": "The beleaguered president of the Philippines, Joseph Estrada, fought back yesterday against corruption allegations, saying that he had rejected a huge bribe from illegal gambling syndicates. He said in radio interviews that the 200m pesos (\u00a32.8m) offered to him by his chief accuser was placed into a \"Muslim youth scholarship fund\" where it remains untouched. But it was unclear why the money had not been returned. Critics of the president say that he has used the fund as a front to launder payoffs. The allegations have led to widespread calls for Mr Estrada's resignation or impeachment. Next week the house of representatives is expected to prepare articles of impeachment, which are expected to be sent swiftly to the senate for a trial. Mr Estrada has been stepping up efforts to rally the urban working class on his side against an opposition which he claims is \"anti-poor\". His followers hope to mobilise support at a mass prayer meeting in Manila tomorrow. The rally has been organised by Mr Estrada's chief spiritual adviser, Mike Velarde, a multi-millionaire who leads a charismatic sect, El Shaddai, which claims to have 5m supporters. \"I would not touch it [payoffs from gambling syndicates],\" Mr Estrada said yesterday, responding for the first time yesterday to the claims by a former crony, Luis Singson, which triggered the crisis. \"Since I was mayor I would not touch [illegal] money - and even more so since I was president.\" He said that Mr Singson, a provincial governor, had offered him the 200m peso bribe from syndicates running a popular numbers game. Mr Singson said a month ago that Mr Estrada had accepted bribes totalling twice that sum. Struggling to win back his populist image, Mr Estrada yesterday approved a long-delayed trust fund to help coconut farmers with shares that had previously been claimed by two of his close political allies. Mr Estrada's camp argue that this shows that he will give no favours to his former cronies. After the crisis broke last month, the president took part in presentations of land deeds to Manila's urban poor, using the occasion to enlist their support. \"You are the ones who put me in power,\" he said. \"Not those elitists in Makati [Manila's business centre].\" Observers say Mr Estrada is trying desperately to regain the credentials as \"friend of the poor\" which secured his landslide victory in 1998. \"It's clear that poor people whether urban or rural haven't yet taken a distinct anti-Estrada position,\" says Joel Rocamora, director of the Institute for Popular Democracy. \"His administration understands that and is doing what it can to keep the support of the lower strata.\" Mr Rocamora says the president is \"playing Santa Claus rather early\" and expects some gesture to be made soon to the rural poor. \"It is not so much that the poor still believe in Erap [Mr Estrada's nickname] but they are sceptical of the opposition.

      "body": "<p>Picture, if you will, London as a living body. Imagine the City as its pulsing heart, the parks its lungs and the tentacular sprawl of streets its veins. Yet pause not to imagine wherein might lie its arsehole. </p> <p> Now picture this mighty organism on a journey through time, though not necessarily a linear chronological projection. We will be taking labyrinthine twists and turns, back and forth through history. It may, at times, be a contradictory peregrination, but one never other than revealing. So pay attention and don't get lost. Or you may end up in Surbiton. </p> <p> The sea has always been part of this great city. For millions of years the land on which London was built was submerged beneath the oceans. Look carefully at parts of London stone and you might find flecks of sea urchin fossils. As the seas subsided, herds of mastodons and hippopotami roamed wild and their remains are still to be found deep beneath the earth of Trafalgar Square. </p> <p> Red is the colour of London. It is the colour of fire and blood, the recurring punctuation marks of the capital, and is commemorated even today on buses and telephone boxes. Virginia Woolf describes the city as 'eternally burnt' and, ever since Boudicca laid waste to Londinium, it has been periodically engulfed in flames.</p> <p> But out of the embers comes renewal; the Great Fire brought the Plague, carried from overseas by rattus rattus and whose pestilential story is told so well in an anecdotal, yet not unconsidered, fashion by Defoe, to its finality. </p> <p> Londoners themselves have an almost pantomimic theatricality; the city slicker and the Cockney wideboy are just two stock characters. But what else might one expect from a city that is a stage unto itself?

      "bodyText": "Picture, if you will, London as a living body. Imagine the City as its pulsing heart, the parks its lungs and the tentacular sprawl of streets its veins. Yet pause not to imagine wherein might lie its arsehole. Now picture this mighty organism on a journey through time, though not necessarily a linear chronological projection. We will be taking labyrinthine twists and turns, back and forth through history. It may, at times, be a contradictory peregrination, but one never other than revealing. So pay attention and don't get lost. Or you may end up in Surbiton. The sea has always been part of this great city. For millions of years the land on which London was built was submerged beneath the oceans. Look carefully at parts of London stone and you might find flecks of sea urchin fossils. As the seas subsided, herds of mastodons and hippopotami roamed wild and their remains are still to be found deep beneath the earth of Trafalgar Square. Red is the colour of London. It is the colour of fire and blood, the recurring punctuation marks of the capital, and is commemorated even today on buses and telephone boxes. Virginia Woolf describes the city as 'eternally burnt' and, ever since Boudicca laid waste to Londinium, it has been periodically engulfed in flames. But out of the embers comes renewal; the Great Fire brought the Plague, carried from overseas by rattus rattus and whose pestilential story is told so well in an anecdotal, yet not unconsidered, fashion by Defoe, to its finality. Londoners themselves have an almost pantomimic theatricality; the city slicker and the Cockney wideboy are just two stock characters. But what else might one expect from a city that is a stage unto itself? And what greater spectacles did London have to offer than its punishments? As Samuel Johnson wrote to Boswell, 'Sir, executions are intended to draw spectators.' Not all were happy when executions were moved from the central arena of Tyburn to behind closed doors in Newgate. If opera, or indeed soap opera, have often been the public image of London, it is commerce that has provided its raison d\u00e9tre. The city is the hub of the nation's trade and, of all the enterprises undertaken, none, I'm sure you may concur, has ever been so fine as this.

It has fun, too, with massed ranks of Barbies and an aisle full of Buzz toys: \"In 1995, short-sighted retailers understocked.\" (In other words, they're going to sell you lots more toys but they can get a joke out of that, too). </p> <p>John Lasseter, who takes sole directing credit this time as well as co-writing, is a wiz at making this work on a number of levels: the vintage toys remind oldies of their own childhood and the toys' obsolescence is mined for pathos rather than sentiment.

Apart from his role in Taxi, recreated here with the rest of the cast, minus DeVito, who is otherwise engaged, it's hard to see how Kaufman ever earned a living. </p> <p>But presumably Carrey and director Milos Forman feel his refusal to be funny in any normal way makes him a rebel in the tradition of Forman's last oddball anti-hero, Larry Flynt. Like Flynt, Forman gives him Courtney Love for a partner. She lights up the screen briefly - it's hard to think of the last rock star who looked this natural acting (maybe Cher). She looks all ready for a lead role herself but sadly, this part is soon reduced to ghastly \"adoring wife\" cliches.

It's full of the sort of half-stoned naivety you expect in, say, Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush. So you have a double-barrelled toff running an underground paper, a bland American lead who intones: \"Only a two bob cab ride from Carnaby Street to Bethnal Green but it's a different world,\" and three east end sister thieves - the curiously interchangeable All Saints who are not Shaznay - who dress as men, are good to their east end dad and hide nicked jewellery in a lava lamp. </p> <p>With old writing pros Clement and La Frenais helping out its three novice actresses and novice director, you suspect this was all meant as a spoof, but the film doesn't seem to think so.

      "body": "<p>It is a strange coincidence that a number of movies out this week treat of the adult's inner child, and the strange forgotten intensity of the friendships and experiences of your school days. But no film serves up this idea with more black comic shock and sheer exuberant lack of taste than Chuck &amp; Buck. </p> <p>It's a pornographic comedy of dysfunction which aspires to debunk the adult world of success, but in so doing sprays satirical acid at the whole idea of the \"inner child\" and the psychobabble piety that the inner child is any more innocent than the raddled outer adult. On the contrary: the inner child is kept inner for a good reason. Because it's a creepy little perv that you need to lock up - and throw away the key. </p> <p>Miguel Arteta directs - and manages to do so with much more restraint and clarity than Harmony Korine might have done with similar material, perhaps because so many of Arteta's colleagues on this film have a more unassuming background in comedy. Chris Weitz (the co-director of American Pie) plays Charlie, a good-looking and way-cool twentysomething record producer in LA. Out of the blue, he receives a letter from Buck, an old school buddy that he hardly remembers, inviting him to his mother's funeral. </p> <p>Charlie and his stylish fianc\u00e9e, Carlyn (Beth Colt), dutifully turn up, only to find to their horror that Buck, played by Mike White, has simply stayed 10 years old in his mind, a grotesque, giggling, child-man - and obsessed with Charlie all these years, hoarding dozens of photos of him as a child. </p> <p>Now Buck, with his T-shirt, shorts, lollipops and weird kiddie songs, wants to resume the friendship he had with Charlie when they were 10 in the Arcadian world of childhood. The nightmare begins as he stalks Charlie and his wife, turning up at their Hollywood house and parties, and at Charlie's office, insisting on his name for him then: Chuck. They will, once again, be Chuck and Buck. </p> <p>Not revealing the ending is an over-rated virtue for the critic, but suffice it to say that this \"Chuck and Buck\" formulation is important because of the rhyming slang it contains about the precise nature of their childhood relationship. Maybe the best point of comparison is with the Stephen Wright joke about the 50-year-old man who runs up to a five-year-old shouting: \"Hey, howya doin' Billy? I haven't seen you for 45 years! Oh... I guess you can't be... because he would have grown up...\" </p> <p>Trying to make conversation with someone you last met in infant school is a bizarre experience because the shared culture of childhood and its enthusiasms are mentionable only in the most detached way. When Buck comes to Charlie's office, he blurts out: \"Remember how we bought all those office supplies when we were 10? Is it real now or is it still like a game?\" Charlie flinches at the weirdness of the question and its tactless truth. </p> <p>What is clear is that he does remember, that we all remember, and that our adult poise is fragile, requiring an elaborate complicity of all the other adults to forget about the ever-present vulnerability of our childhood selves. </p> <p>A movie such as Big starring Tom Hanks tries to suggest that being a big kid is charming and picturesque and innocent, Chuck &amp; Buck suggests that without the retrospective benediction of adulthood, a state with all the careful accretions of self-respect and social prestige, childhood was a monstrous, deracinated state. </p> <p>Arteta and Mike White have taken the starting point of their film as Buck's mother's death, and it is the death of a parent which can give, or will give everyone their final, definitive glimpse into their own \"childhood\" not as something remembered, as a state which no longer applies, but as something alive and real and just below the surface. </p> <p>One of the darkest aspects of this sort of bereavement is supposed to be the sense of suddenly being plunged back into childhood fears, childhood terrors, and dark, unacknowledged childhood fantasies about getting rid of parent-authority. Chuck &amp; Buck dramatises and elaborates these fears in a knockabout, comic-book style with slightly implausible plot complications. </p> <p>The movie is pretty rough and ready and has no ready-made audience to play to: it does not fall easily into any obvious comic category, but it is also - perhaps mercifully - refreshingly without any lofty Dogme-style seriousness, despite being filmed on DV. This is a very distinctive and often very funny picture, disquieting and diverting all at once.</p>",

What is clear is that he does remember, that we all remember, and that our adult poise is fragile, requiring an elaborate complicity of all the other adults to forget about the ever-present vulnerability of our childhood selves. A movie such as Big starring Tom Hanks tries to suggest that being a big kid is charming and picturesque and innocent, Chuck &amp; Buck suggests that without the retrospective benediction of adulthood, a state with all the careful accretions of self-respect and social prestige, childhood was a monstrous, deracinated state. Arteta and Mike White have taken the starting point of their film as Buck's mother's death, and it is the death of a parent which can give, or will give everyone their final, definitive glimpse into their own \"childhood\" not as something remembered, as a state which no longer applies, but as something alive and real and just below the surface. One of the darkest aspects of this sort of bereavement is supposed to be the sense of suddenly being plunged back into childhood fears, childhood terrors, and dark, unacknowledged childhood fantasies about getting rid of parent-authority. Chuck &amp; Buck dramatises and elaborates these fears in a knockabout, comic-book style with slightly implausible plot complications. The movie is pretty rough and ready and has no ready-made audience to play to: it does not fall easily into any obvious comic category, but it is also - perhaps mercifully - refreshingly without any lofty Dogme-style seriousness, despite being filmed on DV. This is a very distinctive and often very funny picture, disquieting and diverting all at once.",

Brought up in Devon, his talent was unearthed as a 14-year-old by Crewe manager Dario Gradi. Tracked by Derby County throughout the 1998-99 season, he eventually chose Derby ahead of Liverpool, feeling the Midlands club would help him develop quicker. A tigerish player at home in left midfield or left wing-back, if selected he would become the fourth Gradi pupil to graduate to the senior England side following Rob Jones, David Platt and Geoff Thomas.</p> <p><strong>Michael Ball</strong> (Everton) <br> Age: 21 <br> Left-back <br> The young Everton defender has only recently reclaimed a place in Walter Smith's first team after a series of disciplinary problems which had him marked down as the new enfant terrible of Merseyside football. Self-confidence has never been a problem for the 21-year-old, who has long argued he is capable of stepping up on several appearances for his country's under-21 side. Kevin Keegan called him into the full squad for the friendly against Hungary in April 1999, after which his problems began. Although he is arguably more effective at wing-back than at full-back, Ball's greatest asset is his natural athleticism. Despite his fondness for challenging authority, Ball is now valued at around \u00a36m and has recently been linked with big-money moves to Manchester United, Arsenal and Leicester.</p> <p><strong>Nicky Butt</strong> (Manchester United) <br> Age: 25 <br> Midfield <br> A strong, tenacious tackler, he is also careful to retain possession. Questions were asked about his temperament after he was sent off twice last season and twice inside a week the season before, but he has picked up only one booking this term. Once seen as the brightest prospect of the United crop that yielded David Beckham and Ryan Giggs. Highly experienced and competitive, he has won eight caps but none since April 1999.</p> <p><strong>Frank Lampard</strong> (West Ham United) <br> Age: 22 <br> Midfield <br> Captained the under-21s under Peter Taylor and made his full debut against Belgium 13 months ago. A hard-working, neat-passing player whose biggest strength arguably lies in his ability to break forward and score goals. Found the net 13 times in 48 games for West Ham last season but only once so far this term in a struggling side. Was troubled by an ankle injury but now back to full fitness.</p> <p><strong>Paul Robinson</strong> (Leeds United) <br> Age: 21 <br> Goalkeeper <br> Robinson had made just five first-team appearances before climbing off the bench to replace the injured Nigel Martyn against Charlton four weeks ago. But having played a major role in Leeds' qualification for the second phase of the Champions League the under-21 international has justified the faith shown in him by David O'Leary, who will face an interesting selection dilemma upon Martyn's return.</p>",

I work for a guy who has three restaurants and I spread my time between the three in a week that consists of approximately 40 to 45 hours. </p> <p>I am feeling really burned out as I haven't had a holiday break since June 1999. My boss has pretty much told me that he will not pay me holiday pay as I am self-employed. He is the only client that I have due to the work load that the three restaurants place upon me. My quality of life is shocking - I am too tired to do a thing after work as the travelling is a 60 mile round trip each day.</p> <p>Whenever I need a day off work I am docked for that day. I have asked him to put me on the payroll but he insists that he will not due to extra employers N.I. and also the fact that he will then have to pay me holiday pay.</p> <p><strong>The solution</strong></p> <p>I bet your boss thinks he is being really clever by effectively keeping a full-time employee on a self-employed basis and thus avoiding providing you with your statutory employment rights (such as holiday pay, sick leave etc). However, your circumstances are such that the law may actually define you as an employee, even though your boss prefers to label you as freelance (of course he does!). Ultimately only the courts can decide the status of individuals and, according to ACAS, they may apply a number of tests including:</p> <p>\u0095 The degree of control - the greater the level of operational control the employer has, the more likely the worker is to be classed as an employee.</p> <p>\u0095 The extent to which the worker is integrated into the employer's organisation - has the worker become part and parcel of the organisation?</p> <p>So, you see, your employer may think that by not putting you on the payroll he is able to avoid giving you your rights, but in actual fact, putting you on the payroll may be irrelevant. You need to seek legal advice so that you know where you stand in the eyes of the law and then make sure your boss knows.</p> <p>Remember, you cannot be sacked for asserting your employee rights so if your boss tried to let you go once you start asking for holiday leave, you would probably have a strong case with an industrial tribunal. However, a gentle approach in which you simply point out your rights and your employer's obligations is likely to be more effective than an aggressive one threatening legal action.</p> <p> \u0095 Dr Sandi Mann is author of Psychology Goes to Work (Purple House) and Managing Your Boss in a Week (Hodder &amp; Stoughton).</p> <p>Advice given to these problems should be regarded as guidelines only, based on the limited information provided by letter-writers.

      "bodyText": "The problem I am a self-employed accounts manager. I work for a guy who has three restaurants and I spread my time between the three in a week that consists of approximately 40 to 45 hours. I am feeling really burned out as I haven't had a holiday break since June 1999. My boss has pretty much told me that he will not pay me holiday pay as I am self-employed. He is the only client that I have due to the work load that the three restaurants place upon me. My quality of life is shocking - I am too tired to do a thing after work as the travelling is a 60 mile round trip each day. Whenever I need a day off work I am docked for that day. I have asked him to put me on the payroll but he insists that he will not due to extra employers N.I. and also the fact that he will then have to pay me holiday pay. The solution I bet your boss thinks he is being really clever by effectively keeping a full-time employee on a self-employed basis and thus avoiding providing you with your statutory employment rights (such as holiday pay, sick leave etc). However, your circumstances are such that the law may actually define you as an employee, even though your boss prefers to label you as freelance (of course he does!). Ultimately only the courts can decide the status of individuals and, according to ACAS, they may apply a number of tests including: \u0095 The degree of control - the greater the level of operational control the employer has, the more likely the worker is to be classed as an employee. \u0095 The extent to which the worker is integrated into the employer's organisation - has the worker become part and parcel of the organisation? So, you see, your employer may think that by not putting you on the payroll he is able to avoid giving you your rights, but in actual fact, putting you on the payroll may be irrelevant. You need to seek legal advice so that you know where you stand in the eyes of the law and then make sure your boss knows. Remember, you cannot be sacked for asserting your employee rights so if your boss tried to let you go once you start asking for holiday leave, you would probably have a strong case with an industrial tribunal. However, a gentle approach in which you simply point out your rights and your employer's obligations is likely to be more effective than an aggressive one threatening legal action. \u0095 Dr Sandi Mann is author of Psychology Goes to Work (Purple House) and Managing Your Boss in a Week (Hodder &amp; Stoughton).

Folly finds Johnston musing on the horrors of the world, everything from the horrible influence of Hollywood movies to the evils of fast food: \"The cows stand in line waiting to be hamburger, oh how they suffer.\" It looks funny written down, but there is something appalling about the bleak clarity of Johnston's lyrics. This isn't naivety, the word most often used to describe him, it is a deliberate morbid honesty and not a little gallows humour. \"I had a dream that a man was sentenced to death for attempting to commit suicide,\" Johnston tells us blankly.

His achievements received the warmest of celebrations in a 70th birthday tribute concert: an all-British programme of relatively little-known works from the 1930s. With not a whiff of the \"cowpat school\" about them, Handley's chosen works - Bliss's Music for Strings, Vaughan Williams's Five Tudor Portraits and Bax's Sixth Symphony - together provided compelling evidence of the breadth of talent and originality of composers who can be all too easily pigeonholed. </p> <p>In fact, Bliss's homeland could scarcely be guessed at from his Music for Strings, which had perceptible Slavic leanings, most discernible in the intensity of his soloistic string textures. By contrast, Vaughan Williams' settings of John Skelton's poems evoked a English schoolboyish humour and boisterousness, as well as the familiar bittersweet lyricism prompted by Jane Scroop's lament over her dead pet sparrow. The irony of Skelton's poem is smoothed over by the tenderness of its musical setting, which seems to bear out the composer's avowed sympathy with Skelton's mournful heroine. Here, as elsewhere in the Portraits, the RLPO and chorus were on fine form; contralto Liane Keegan was particularly impressive as the passionate Jane, although Damian Thantrey's baritone was perhaps slightly constrained in a rather subdued rendition of Pretty Bess. The first and last songs romped along with a Dionysian energy, with a wonderfully tipsy bassoon solo in the first, The Tunning of Elinor Rumming. </p> <p>Performances of Bax's symphonies are rare events; Handley's choice of the Sixth for his birthday concert testifies to his special affinity for this unfairly neglected work. Whether the RLPO were simply tired out by a demanding first half, or whether shortage of rehearsal time had been a problem, they were not able to deliver on this occasion. </p> <p>This was a pity, since Bax's Sixth is not an easy piece to love on first hearing; many of its textures and cross-rhythms are unusual enough to be off-putting if not played with total conviction. In the context of such dedicated programming, full appreciation of this work was difficult; nevertheless, to hear it at all made this concert a special event.</p>",

The work was left unfinished at Mahler's death, with only the first movement in a definitive, orchestrated form. </p> <p>However, the sketches for the remaining four movements are advanced enough to represent a continuous draft of the whole symphony. For those who see the elegiac final movement of his Ninth Symphony as a reconciliation with his fate (Mahler had been diagnosed with a fatal heart condition) the completed 10th Symphony is too bitter a vision to contemplate. Even as far as its opening adagio, the symphony plunges into a nightmarish, desperate world - suggesting that Mahler did not find spiritual peace in his final years after all. </p> <p>Thanks to the passionate performances of conductors such as Simon Rattle and Riccardo Chailly, the completion of the 10th Symphony by Deryck Cooke, in collaboration with Berthold Goldschmidt and David and Colin Matthews, is now much more than a mere concert-hall curiosity. However, it is still unusual to hear an alternative version of the symphony. Around the same time that Cooke was working on his edition, the American Clinton Carpenter embarked upon his own attempt to bring Mahler's sketches to life. Rarely heard in this country, Carpenter's realisation was performed by Andrew Litton and the Bourne-mouth Symphony Orchestra. </p> <p>The broad outlines of both versions are similar. It is in the details of the orchestrations that differences are most acute. The challenge for anyone daring to breathe life into Mahler's sketches is in matching the extraordinary range of Mahler's imagination. In Mahler's other symphonies, instrumental timbre is almost as crucial to the narrative of the music as the notes. And though Carpenter creates a definite contrast between the worlds of each movement - from the rustic energy of the second to the weird dervishes of the third - there are also places of un-Mahlerian muddiness. </p> <p>But Litton and the BSO were committed advocates of Carpenter's Mahler, and made the symphony a terrifying revelation. Even the signs of strife in the enormously taxing string lines of the first and last movements only added to the sense of the human torment of this music, and the emotional abyss that Mahler creates. The 10th Symphony remains an enigma, in whichever version it is played: surely that would have been true even if Mahler himself had lived to complete the piece.</p>",
