Huntingdon sufferers pay two or three times as much for insurance.</p> <p>The disease affects an estimated one in 20,000 people. Future rulings on more widespread diseases, such as breast cancer, will have a much wider impact if the GAIC says insurers can use test information.</p> <p>Most insurers charge higher premiums for genetic pre-dispositions, but some refuse to extend cover if they decide a person is too much of a risk. Alternatively, they may decide to offer cover but only if the insurance policy is modified to fit a person's circumstances. For example, a 30 year old Huntingdon's sufferer may be offered a 10 year life insurance policy if his father didn't start developing signs of the disease until his 40's. </p> <p>If, against expectations, the GAIC rules the test for Huntingdon's is not reliable enough for insurance purposes, the Association of British Insurers said it will instruct its members to stop using the test and refund excess premiums.</p>",

At present, the insurance industry does not ask people to take genetic tests as a condition for cover, but its code of practice states it may use the results of tests for seven diseases, including Huntingdon's, Alzheimers and breast cancer, providing they were carried out prior to the person applying for insurance. The GAIC's approval of the test would mark an endorsement of the insurance industry's approach, but is likely to fuel controversy surrounding the issue, with opponents claiming people with a hereditary genetic condition will be penalised through higher premiums. Huntingdon sufferers pay two or three times as much for insurance. The disease affects an estimated one in 20,000 people. Future rulings on more widespread diseases, such as breast cancer, will have a much wider impact if the GAIC says insurers can use test information. Most insurers charge higher premiums for genetic pre-dispositions, but some refuse to extend cover if they decide a person is too much of a risk. Alternatively, they may decide to offer cover but only if the insurance policy is modified to fit a person's circumstances. For example, a 30 year old Huntingdon's sufferer may be offered a 10 year life insurance policy if his father didn't start developing signs of the disease until his 40's. If, against expectations, the GAIC rules the test for Huntingdon's is not reliable enough for insurance purposes, the Association of British Insurers said it will instruct its members to stop using the test and refund excess premiums.",

In the latter, Cynthia Clarey's lines have a more conventional contour of tension and release. Yet just as in the first setting, the ending of House by the Sea - along with the second Rilke aphorism - represents a journey without end.

The next 10 days will see a revival of the Don Giovanni first seen at this summer's festival, and the British premiere of Birtwistle's The Last Supper, in the production that opened in Berlin in April, but David McVicar's staging of La Boh\u00e8me, conducted by GTO's new music director, Louis Langree, provides the best possible, most invigorating start to the tour. </p> <p>La Boh\u00e8me is an opera about young people, and for once it is cast with young singers, whose exuberance makes the tragedy of the last act even more affecting. Through Michael Vale's ingenious sets and Mikki Engelsbel's costumes the action is updated from Paris in the 1830s to present-day London. Rodolfo and his friends live in a squalid flat (just one rung up the social ladder, you sense, from homelessness), but the problems that usually go with updatings - details that don't fit, issues that have to be fudged - are solved triumphantly. In the first act Rodolfo fuses the lights in the flat to produce the darkness that has Mimi trying to light a candle, while the Cafe Momus becomes a glitzy bar, complete with flouncing waiters, silly Christmas hats, street performers and a throng of Christmas shoppers. In the third act the city gates of the original become the shuttered entrance to a tube station, and Marcello is painting a mural for the seedy club next door, while the Bohemians, back together in their flat for the final scene, snort cocaine (except for Rodolfo) just before the dying Mimi appears. </p> <p>If all this were cosmetic it would mean very little. But McVicar has obtained performances of such telling detail from every member of the cast that the whole drama becomes utterly credible. The way in which Rodolfo (a supremely intelligent performance from Alfred Boe) charts his falling-in-love with Mimi (the touching Simona Todaro) through both his body language and his singing is compelling. This is a man, wimpish and hopeless in many respects, who can't believe what he is experiencing, who realises his whole life is about to be transformed by this encounter. This is in total contrast to the worldly-wise attitude of Marcello (the commanding Luca Grassi) towards his tempestuous affair with the flighty Musetta (Claron MacFadden, visually and vocally spectacular). When at the end of the third act Rudolfo and Mimi agree to stay together at least until the spring, the way in which they leave, he uncertainly a few paces behind, says more about the fragility of their relationship than any of their declarations. </p> <p>Only one detail is puzzling. When Mimi makes her first timid approach to the door of Rodolfo's flat we see Musetta in the darkness, urging her forward, as if the two women are close friends - unlikely given their very different personalities, one would have thought, unless Mimi's history differs from the version she gives to Rodolfo. That one cares about these few seconds of the production is an indication of how thoughtful the show is and how completely it draws the audience into its world and its characters, and how they are brought so convincingly to life by every member of the cast. The contributions of Nicolas Teste (Colline), Riccardo Novaro (Schaunard) and Eric Roberts (Benoit and Alcindoro) are as significant as those of the principals. </p> <p>Langree's conducting is vital too.

      "body": "<p>As a choreographer, one of Merce Cunningham's most extraordinary projects has been to reinvent the stage. Rather than placing his dancers in regular patterns, with the focus centre stage, he makes his choreography appear like a random visual field. Different dance activities may be happening simultaneously across the stage, while the number of performers grows and shrinks with a rhythm impossible to predict. Watching a Cunningham dance is like watching real life throwing up images and patterns out of apparent chaos. </p> <p>So it's not surprising that in Biped, Cunningham's first voyage into digital dance (a live performance into which computerised moving images have been projected) we're treated to monumental and magical spatial illusions. As one woman dances alone, bars of coloured light track across a transparent scrim in front of her. The spaces between the bars widen, creating a dizzying sense of the whole stage expanding. Then they contract and disappear and the dancer's body suddenly looks more dense - a concentration of atoms posed in crystalline light. </p> <p>The height of these vertical bars gives a vaulting grandeur to the stage that is vividly subverted when the digital images are animated into chatty bubbles of light or swirling formations. Frequently the images take human form and spin through the real dancers. At times they are giants, bending over the sweating humans, then they are pygmies skittering between them. Most enchantingly, they blur into feathery movement trails, which seem like ghosts or maybe muscle memories of the dancers inscribed in light. </p> <p>While the animated images dance, so do the humans. Biped is set to music by Gavin Bryars, in which drones and melodies are densely layered, and the dancers similarly cluster into unison groupings from which individuals randomly detach. The choreography is angular with occasional fierce outbursts of speed, yet there's a peculiar tenderness to it. One recurrent motif is a raised arm that looks like a gesture of appeal; it's a signal that binds the dancers together. They seem like a tribe apart, a futuristic family in a palace of electronic grandeur. </p> <p>Biped is an awesome project, though purists may find its richness disconcerting when viewed next to Cunningham's 1958 classic Summerspace. This beautiful piece relies simply on the poetics of dance - its infinitely detailed moves not only laying out the resources of the moving body but also making us think of birds flocking, lovers courting or insects droning. </p> <p>The pleasure of Cunningham's choreography is the way it distils his unique angle on the world. It may just be people moving yet it captures the sensibility of a New Yorker looking at nature, a visual artist with an athlete's genius, a zen poet with a practical bent. </p> <p> Until Saturday.

Different dance activities may be happening simultaneously across the stage, while the number of performers grows and shrinks with a rhythm impossible to predict. Watching a Cunningham dance is like watching real life throwing up images and patterns out of apparent chaos. So it's not surprising that in Biped, Cunningham's first voyage into digital dance (a live performance into which computerised moving images have been projected) we're treated to monumental and magical spatial illusions. As one woman dances alone, bars of coloured light track across a transparent scrim in front of her. The spaces between the bars widen, creating a dizzying sense of the whole stage expanding. Then they contract and disappear and the dancer's body suddenly looks more dense - a concentration of atoms posed in crystalline light. The height of these vertical bars gives a vaulting grandeur to the stage that is vividly subverted when the digital images are animated into chatty bubbles of light or swirling formations. Frequently the images take human form and spin through the real dancers. At times they are giants, bending over the sweating humans, then they are pygmies skittering between them. Most enchantingly, they blur into feathery movement trails, which seem like ghosts or maybe muscle memories of the dancers inscribed in light. While the animated images dance, so do the humans. Biped is set to music by Gavin Bryars, in which drones and melodies are densely layered, and the dancers similarly cluster into unison groupings from which individuals randomly detach. The choreography is angular with occasional fierce outbursts of speed, yet there's a peculiar tenderness to it. One recurrent motif is a raised arm that looks like a gesture of appeal; it's a signal that binds the dancers together. They seem like a tribe apart, a futuristic family in a palace of electronic grandeur. Biped is an awesome project, though purists may find its richness disconcerting when viewed next to Cunningham's 1958 classic Summerspace. This beautiful piece relies simply on the poetics of dance - its infinitely detailed moves not only laying out the resources of the moving body but also making us think of birds flocking, lovers courting or insects droning. The pleasure of Cunningham's choreography is the way it distils his unique angle on the world. It may just be people moving yet it captures the sensibility of a New Yorker looking at nature, a visual artist with an athlete's genius, a zen poet with a practical bent. Until Saturday.

Subs: McManaman, Martyn, Barmby, Ferdinand, J Cole, Brown, Owen. </p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> A Sars (France) </p> <p><strong>1 min</strong> Finland kick off.<br> <strong>3 mins</strong> After a couple of minutes during which next to nothing happens, the ball falls to on-loan Palace striker Forssell, who takes a snap shot. Captain Keown leaps in the way to block a frankly poor effort.<br> <strong>5</strong> Another worrying moment for England as Litmanen finds Forssell in more space - to no avail, luckily.<br> <strong>6</strong> A dreadful back-pass puts Sheringham clear, with only keeper Niemi to beat. He races towards the edge of the box and rounds the Finn... but he's brought down on the edge of the area. Is it a penalty? Is it a sending off? Of course it isn't. Niemi is booked, a free-kick is awarded, and it's wasted. Bah, grumble and more bah.<br> <strong>11</strong> Finland win a corner which is cleared by Heskey, of all people. The ball finds Cole who storms forward with murderous intent, but he's easily bustled out of things by Tihinen.<br> <strong>13</strong> Scholes, foraging in the Finnish area, gets his head on the end of a loose ball. It sails towards the top corner but Hyypia blocks. It's a corner. Swiftly followed by a goal-kick.<br> <strong>16</strong> Nurmela chips an interesting ball into the English box, but things quickly turn boring when it becomes clear no Finnish striker available to pick up play. Still, nice to see the other side of the pitch.<br> <strong>19</strong> Heskey-baiters, hold your tounges! The Liverpool bargain bustles down the wing and cuts into the box. Unfortunately, he's edged out of the way, but only at the expense of the corner. Not pretty, but direct and nearly effective.<br> <strong>22</strong> Sheringham nearly gets clear again, and Niemi goes on another sortie outside his penalty area. This one is more successful and the keeper hoofs clear.<br> <strong>24</strong> England win a free-kick just outside the Finnish box. Wise whips it in from the left and finds Heskey, who flicks a header which is scrambled off the line. Keown nearly pops his big boots onto it, as well. No goal, of course, but not bad.<br> <strong>27</strong> Finland are beginning to rock. Saarinen heads back towards his keeper, but only manages to find Cole, who wastes the chance with a shot straight at the man between the sticks. At this rate England must score. Mustn't they?<br> <strong>32</strong> A free-kick for Finland in a dangerous position just outside the English box. Litmanen's effort is rubbish, to be frank, but credit to Southgate for getting his head to it and nutting it far, far away.<br> <strong>34</strong> A lovely little one-two between Parlour, in the game for the first time, and Barry, in the game for, er, the first time. But let's not knock them - they've carved out some space beautifully. Parlour sends an inviting cross towards the feet of Cole who - cue theme music from Some Mothers Do Ave Em - takes a fresh-air shot. Heskey tries to bundle it in, but the chance has gone.<br> <strong>37 Substitution</strong> Finnish right-back Helin limps off, Reini comes on.<br> <strong>38</strong> A bit of after-yous between Scholes and Wise on the edge of the box. Great timing, lads. Litmanen nicks off with the ball, thank you very much, and wallops it towards Forssell who is loitering in the centre.

But it's going nowhere and the danger is cleared.<br> <strong>49</strong> Nurmela beats Barry down the right and sends a cross into the England box.

Again.<br> <strong>61</strong> And again.<br> <strong>63</strong> A long clearance from Niemi results in a Finnish corner.

England Seaman, P Neville, Barry, Wise, Southgate, Keown, Parlour, Scholes, A Cole, Sheringham, Heskey. Subs: McManaman, Martyn, Barmby, Ferdinand, J Cole, Brown, Owen. Referee A Sars (France) 1 min Finland kick off. 3 mins After a couple of minutes during which next to nothing happens, the ball falls to on-loan Palace striker Forssell, who takes a snap shot. Captain Keown leaps in the way to block a frankly poor effort. 5 Another worrying moment for England as Litmanen finds Forssell in more space - to no avail, luckily. 6 A dreadful back-pass puts Sheringham clear, with only keeper Niemi to beat. He races towards the edge of the box and rounds the Finn... but he's brought down on the edge of the area. Is it a penalty? Is it a sending off? Of course it isn't. Niemi is booked, a free-kick is awarded, and it's wasted. Bah, grumble and more bah. 11 Finland win a corner which is cleared by Heskey, of all people. The ball finds Cole who storms forward with murderous intent, but he's easily bustled out of things by Tihinen. 13 Scholes, foraging in the Finnish area, gets his head on the end of a loose ball. It sails towards the top corner but Hyypia blocks. It's a corner. Swiftly followed by a goal-kick. 16 Nurmela chips an interesting ball into the English box, but things quickly turn boring when it becomes clear no Finnish striker available to pick up play. Still, nice to see the other side of the pitch. 19 Heskey-baiters, hold your tounges! The Liverpool bargain bustles down the wing and cuts into the box. Unfortunately, he's edged out of the way, but only at the expense of the corner. Not pretty, but direct and nearly effective. 22 Sheringham nearly gets clear again, and Niemi goes on another sortie outside his penalty area. This one is more successful and the keeper hoofs clear. 24 England win a free-kick just outside the Finnish box. Wise whips it in from the left and finds Heskey, who flicks a header which is scrambled off the line. Keown nearly pops his big boots onto it, as well. No goal, of course, but not bad. 27 Finland are beginning to rock. Saarinen heads back towards his keeper, but only manages to find Cole, who wastes the chance with a shot straight at the man between the sticks. At this rate England must score. Mustn't they? 32 A free-kick for Finland in a dangerous position just outside the English box. Litmanen's effort is rubbish, to be frank, but credit to Southgate for getting his head to it and nutting it far, far away. 34 A lovely little one-two between Parlour, in the game for the first time, and Barry, in the game for, er, the first time. But let's not knock them - they've carved out some space beautifully. Parlour sends an inviting cross towards the feet of Cole who - cue theme music from Some Mothers Do Ave Em - takes a fresh-air shot. Heskey tries to bundle it in, but the chance has gone. 37 Substitution Finnish right-back Helin limps off, Reini comes on. 38 A bit of after-yous between Scholes and Wise on the edge of the box. Great timing, lads. Litmanen nicks off with the ball, thank you very much, and wallops it towards Forssell who is loitering in the centre. He pulls the trigger but leans back to send the ball sailing over the bar. Wheeee! 40 This really could have been quite hellish.

      "bodyText": "Raindance, Britain's largest and most exciting independent film festival comes to London this Friday, October 13 for two weeks at London's Metro Cinema. Whether you're a film-maker, a wannabe star or a fan of independent film, there's screenings, events and workshops to please every taste. The festival opens with the London premiere of Chuck and Buck, an offbeat comedy which was the US indie success of the summer. This will be screened alongside The Suicidal Dog, Paul Merton's first short film as writer/director. Other festival highlights include the London premiere of Christopher Nolan's innovative and compelling psychological thriller Memento. Christopher Nolan will also be at the festival to present a retrospective of his work and answer questions on his acclaimed new film. You can also catch one of the successes from Cannes earlier this year, Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her, the directorial debut from Rodrigo Garcia (son of Gabriel Garcia Marquez), starring Calista Flockheart, Glenn Close and Cameron Diaz, the first film to be made in English under the Dogma 95 rules - The King is Alive, Three Below Zero, which stars Wes (American Beauty) Bentley and tells the tale of three diverse New Yorkers who find themselves trapped in a laundry room, and an adaptation of Martin Amis's cult novel Dead Babies, which won't be opening in the UK until February 2001. As far as events go, we like the sound of Live!Ammunition! on Thursday 19 October - in which aspiring film-makers get just five minutes on stage to pitch their idea to a panel of industry experts. Also worth catching is this year's Alexander Mackendrick Memorial Lecture, which will be presented by British director Stephen Frears. And the illustrious cinematographer Jack Cardiff, who lists African Queen, Red Shoes and Rambo among his many cinematic credits, will be in town, talking about his extraordinary career. The festival closes on Thursday 26 October with the UK premiere of the British comedy It Was An Accident (pictured). This Walthamstow-set film has been nominated for two British Independent Film Awards, and boasts an exciting young cast which includes Max Beesley and Thandie Newton. The festival website has full details, and promises to be an event in itself for non London-based film fans, with over 100 live webcasts from the festival, movie clips, and the tantalising promise of the opportunity to catch glimpses of the stars and even meet the talent, producers and directors in exclusive interviews. We have two festival passes (worth \u00a375 each) to be won, giving the winner access to every screening and special event of the festival, including the opening and closing night. For the chance of winning one of these passes, email feedback@filmunlimited.co.uk, please put Raindance Festival in the subject line, and include your name and a daytime telephone number (or where we can contact you on Friday morning).

Backbench Labour MPs hailed the new fund - launched by Gordon Brown, the chancellor, and John Prescott, the deputy prime minister - as a shift in government policy to address the north-south divide. A year after the prime minister dismissed divisions between England's regions as a gross over-simplification, senior ministers were at pains to stress that new measures were needed to bridge the gap between the largely prosperous south and the poorer north.

They warned that town halls would have to set strict targets to qualify for the cash, which will be spread over three years from next April. Each year, for instance, they would have to show that the health, education and job prospects of communities were improving before being allocated further cash.

Now, though, a study in London's east end has come up with startling findings that spending money on housing clearly saves money on health care. </p> <p>On one measure, the research suggests that people's health may improve as much as sevenfold when they move into new, more spacious surroundings. The conclusion, based on self-reporting of illness, is described as \"almost incredible\" by the academic who led the study. </p> <p>The findings, still unpublished, are due to be released by Tower Hamlets council later this month. The council, together with East London and the City health authority, commissioned Peter Ambrose to monitor the health of residents of two estates in Stepney as they were moved from rundown housing into new properties. The work has been among the first of its kind. </p> <p>Ambrose, visiting professor at Brighton University's health and social policy research centre, says the \"astonishing\" key finding is that, before the move, people on the Ocean and Limehouse Fields estates said they felt ill one day in three; after, they reported illness just one day in 20. </p> <p>What is more, the final research was carried out during the flu outbreak in January this year. People said they were visiting their GP less frequently, having fewer days off sick from work and were recovering from illness more quickly. </p> <p>The number of illness days per person was found to have fallen from 0.37 to 0.05 per 100 days. \"By this measure, perhaps the most accurate index of the incidence of illness, there has been a dramatic improvement,\" says Ambrose. \"We would not have believed the improvement if we had not found similar evidence in a comparison we did in 1995 between the situation then in Tower Hamlets and a regeneration project in Paddington. We can conclude this is something real.\" </p> <p>The Stepney regeneration project has so far involved emptying three 30-year-old tower blocks on the two estates and demolishing other housing up to 70 years old. It has encompassed 800 homes and 2,500 people - the majority Bangladeshi - who have been rehoused in houses or flats with gardens. Many of these gardens are now a riot of vigorous pumpkins, tomatoes and purple chillies. </p> <p>The project, funded by the central Stepney single regeneration budget (SRB), began in 1995 with residents' consultation meetings under the direction of the Stepney Housing and Development Agency (Shada). Redevelopment is continuing under a New Deal for Communities project. </p> <p>The Ocean and Limehouse Fields estates' residents are predominantly from Sylett, a province of Bangladesh, and are disproportionately young - one in two are under 19. One of the greatest benefits of the new housing has been improved school attendance. People also told researchers they now felt safer at home and on the estates; less afraid of crime and more ready to let children play outside. The new homes, which range from one to six bedrooms and include some designed for disabled residents, have been built with security measures such as fireproof letter boxes. </p> <p>The researchers questioned people opting to be rehoused on the same estates. Before they moved, in 1996, they were seen for at least an hour; after, earlier this year, they had a three-hour interview. A total of 227 people were seen on both occasions, although some from the first sample were not contactable for the second. About 70% of those interviewed were under 30 and very few over 70: just 1.5% in 1996, rising to 3.5% in the 2000 sample. Only about one in 10 was in full-time work and most households were dependent on benefits. </p> <p>The study report, A Drop In The Ocean, links health improvements with less overcrowding - the average household has 4.5 people - and fewer problems with damp and infestations. Importantly, the new homes have space to dry clothes away from living areas. The number of people per room has fallen from 1.4 to 1.1 and, although this rates as overcrowding under official deprivation indices, the researchers found nobody complaining of the issue in 2000. </p> <p>One local GP, Michael St John, whose 7,000-patient practice serves both estates, says: \"If you move from really grotty houses that are damp and cockroach-infested and overcrowded, then subjectively I would say your sense of health will improve.\" </p> <p>The study acknowledges that by no means all the health improvement is down to housing. Other schemes likely to have led to better health and well-being include a number aimed particularly at women, run through the Ocean estate's community centre, Dame Colet House, which also has a one-stop nurse clinic. </p> <p>Kadaja Ahmed, the centre's manager who grew up and lives locally, says the new housing is not a wholly positive picture. People have faced higher costs and disliked the transfer from council tenancies to management by housing associations. \"Health is better. People feel better. But if they had a problem they used to be able to complain to their councillor,\" she says. \"They have lost that power.\" </p> <p>The study also found that people feel the level of available health care has declined: it was more difficult to get a doctor's or hospital appointment and a local chemist had closed. </p> <p>Ambrose is now researching the adverse effects, including the increased costs of the better, larger homes, which attract higher rents, council taxes, heating bills and water rates. About 80% of households interviewed this year were on housing benefit, compared to 50% of those in 1996, and higher housing costs are likely to prove a deterrent to entering employment. </p> <p>A Drop In The Ocean also acknowledges that health levels in the rest of Stepney, and Tower Hamlets generally, have not improved - raising the question of whether SRB money might have been more effectively spent on a wider project. </p> <p>Ambrose says: \"The gain doesn't just come from better housing.

      "body": "<p>If you really want to take the racial temperature in Britain, you would be better off examining the reactions to the report on multi-ethnic Britain rather than the report itself. Not that the report itself is not engaging. It is the bravest attempt, post-Stephen Lawrence, not only to assess what is wrong but to praise what is right and to suggest how we might start to right the wrongs. But the reactions of Lord Tebbit, Gerald Howarth MP and the Daily Telegraph leader writers suggest that we may be no closer to having a mature and open debate about race in this country than we are about cannabis.</p> <p>The Telegraph's front page headline yesterday: \"Straw wants to rewrite our history\" begs two central questions. Who do they mean by \"our\" and precisely what version of history are they talking about.</p> <p>The answers lead us beyond race and ethnicity to whether a post-colonial, devolved Britain is ready to take its place in the modern world.</p> <p>The \"our\" the Telegraph refers to is essentially white, English and nationalistic. For huge numbers of Scots, Welsh and Irish, not to mention those of Caribbean, Asian, African and Chinese descent the idea that \"the description of British will never do on its own\" is not news. For generations they have been looking for ways to describe their relationship to Britishness that would take account not only of geography but of cultural, economic and political reality. They have done so not at the behest of a group of academics and commentators, but in response to racism, empire and nationalism.</p> <p>Nowhere is this more obvious than in the national flag. Unlike the French tricolore or the American stars and stripes, we do not have a national emblem that stands for a set of notional egalitarian principles or a constitution that would give it meaning. The union flag is a conqueror's flag that owes its design to the subjugation of England's Celtic neighbours and its reputation to the predatory expeditions which saw Britain steal huge amounts of land, labour and natural resources.It is the emblem they chose to wave at Wembley on Saturday while chanting to the German fans: \"Stand up if you won the war.\"</p> <p>So \"Britishness\" like the union flag is not neutral. Nor is it static. Its meaning shifts at a pace and scale determined not by Britain alone but the world around us and will manifest itself in a myriad of ways. The Indian restaurants on \"our\" high streets, the music on \"our\" stereos and the Olympians on \"our\" television screen are all powerful indications that while Britain will always be a majority white country, Britishness and whiteness are no longer synonymous. The relationship between race and place is being decoupled. The generation that admired Jim Davidson is having trouble understanding a world which produced Ali G.</p> <p>So if people stop using the term \"Britishness\" it will not be because Bhikhu Parekh tells them to, but because the word has lost its meaning. That is truly what the right is afraid of. It is no accident that the Telegraph refers to the past while the report refers to the future.</p> <p>For the paper's reaction is concerned not with culture that is live, evolving and complex, but heritage that is frozen, atrophied and mytholigised. It cannot fathom the report's suggestion that \"people must be treated equally ... with due regard to differences in experience, background and perception\" because it cannot understand the difference between discriminating between people and discriminating against them. It wants to tolerate minorities, the authors of the report want to celebrate them.</p> <p>That does not mean there are not problems with the report. Its recommendation that the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) should be replaced by a human rights commission and a single Equality Act covering all grounds of unlawful discrimination puts an intellectual discussion ahead of political reality.</p> <p>The Future of Multi-ethnic Britain is a report with valuable signposts about where we have to go to become a country built on equality and mutual respect; the intial reactions provide valuable indications of the kind of barriers that will have to be overcome to get there.</p>",

Not that the report itself is not engaging. It is the bravest attempt, post-Stephen Lawrence, not only to assess what is wrong but to praise what is right and to suggest how we might start to right the wrongs. But the reactions of Lord Tebbit, Gerald Howarth MP and the Daily Telegraph leader writers suggest that we may be no closer to having a mature and open debate about race in this country than we are about cannabis. The Telegraph's front page headline yesterday: \"Straw wants to rewrite our history\" begs two central questions. Who do they mean by \"our\" and precisely what version of history are they talking about. The answers lead us beyond race and ethnicity to whether a post-colonial, devolved Britain is ready to take its place in the modern world. The \"our\" the Telegraph refers to is essentially white, English and nationalistic. For huge numbers of Scots, Welsh and Irish, not to mention those of Caribbean, Asian, African and Chinese descent the idea that \"the description of British will never do on its own\" is not news. For generations they have been looking for ways to describe their relationship to Britishness that would take account not only of geography but of cultural, economic and political reality. They have done so not at the behest of a group of academics and commentators, but in response to racism, empire and nationalism. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the national flag. Unlike the French tricolore or the American stars and stripes, we do not have a national emblem that stands for a set of notional egalitarian principles or a constitution that would give it meaning. The union flag is a conqueror's flag that owes its design to the subjugation of England's Celtic neighbours and its reputation to the predatory expeditions which saw Britain steal huge amounts of land, labour and natural resources.It is the emblem they chose to wave at Wembley on Saturday while chanting to the German fans: \"Stand up if you won the war.\" So \"Britishness\" like the union flag is not neutral. Nor is it static. Its meaning shifts at a pace and scale determined not by Britain alone but the world around us and will manifest itself in a myriad of ways. The Indian restaurants on \"our\" high streets, the music on \"our\" stereos and the Olympians on \"our\" television screen are all powerful indications that while Britain will always be a majority white country, Britishness and whiteness are no longer synonymous. The relationship between race and place is being decoupled. The generation that admired Jim Davidson is having trouble understanding a world which produced Ali G. So if people stop using the term \"Britishness\" it will not be because Bhikhu Parekh tells them to, but because the word has lost its meaning. That is truly what the right is afraid of. It is no accident that the Telegraph refers to the past while the report refers to the future. For the paper's reaction is concerned not with culture that is live, evolving and complex, but heritage that is frozen, atrophied and mytholigised. It cannot fathom the report's suggestion that \"people must be treated equally ... with due regard to differences in experience, background and perception\" because it cannot understand the difference between discriminating between people and discriminating against them. It wants to tolerate minorities, the authors of the report want to celebrate them. That does not mean there are not problems with the report. Its recommendation that the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) should be replaced by a human rights commission and a single Equality Act covering all grounds of unlawful discrimination puts an intellectual discussion ahead of political reality. The Future of Multi-ethnic Britain is a report with valuable signposts about where we have to go to become a country built on equality and mutual respect; the intial reactions provide valuable indications of the kind of barriers that will have to be overcome to get there.",

In this context, does \"Britishness\" have a future? Some believe devolution, globalisation and the new cultural diversity have undermined it irretrievably. The government has stated that it is committed \"to creating one nation\". What values and loyalties must be shared by communities and individuals in one nation? Most theoretical debates on such issues in Britain have been between what may be called nationalist and liberal theories of society. Under the nationalist model, the state promotes a single national culture and expects all to assimilate it. People who do not or cannot assimilate are second-class citizens. Under the liberal model, there is a single political culture in the public sphere, but substantial diversity in the private lives of citizens. A third model is the pluralist one which rejects a hard and fast distinction between public and private spheres and envisages that the public realm should be continually revised to accommodate cultural diversity in society at large. This model is to be found in multicultural societies such as Canada, Australia, Malaysia and India. The need now is for debates between liberal and pluralist theories. Britain should develop both as a community of citizens [the liberal view] and as a community of communities [the pluralist view]. A more ceremonious form of welcome for new British citizens might help everyone reflect on the value of citizenship. As far as racism is concerned, hostility that uses skin colour and physical appearance as markers of supposed difference does not represent the whole picture. There is also hostility using markers connected with culture, language and religion. A distinction needs also to be drawn between overt racism and institutional racism. Differentials in income and life-chances between black, Asian and Irish people and the rest of the population must be tackled. Sixty per cent of people of Bangladeshi or Pakistani origin live in poverty. More than half of African-Caribbean and African people live in districts with the highest rates of unemployment. Also, entirely independently of ethnicity, there must be progress to cut differentials in the general population between regions and neighbourhoods. Negotiations over contested issues - for example, the content of the national curriculum, the wearing of religious clothing at work - cannot take place in an ethical vacuum. They require ground rules that provide a minimum guarantee of protection for individuals and a framework for handling conflicts of interest. Such ground rules are provided in part by international human rights standards. The country's criminal justice system must on the one hand deal with racist crime with the utmost vigour; on the other, it must engage in its own processes with the utmost professionalism and fairness and with the minimum of damage to wider relationships and public trust. There is a growing body of data showing that black and Irish people are treated differentially at all stages of the criminal justice process, and that they are disproportionately likely to be imprisoned. In education, monitoring by ethnicity is inadequate or non-existent. There are substantial inequalities affecting, in particular, pupils and students from African-Caribbean, Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities. The cultural fabric of a society expresses ideas of who \"we\" are. The media has an essential role to play. The NHS depends...on the contributions of Asian, black and Irish doctors, nurses, managers and ancillary staff. At the same time, patterns of mortality and morbidity are more serious in Asian, black and Irish communities than in the population as a whole, and there is much insensitivity in the NHS to the distinctive experiences, situations and requirements of these communities. There are two problems with the approach to asylum and immigration by both major political parties. First, the sense of panic the issue instils and the subjectivity with which it is discussed lead to bad law that does not work even in its own terms, giving rise to challenges both in UK courts and among international human rights bodies. Second, it undermines Britain's development as a community of communities. If Britain is to flourish, its political leaders should shape, not pander to, public opinion on issues relating to race and diversity. A thoroughgoing review of religion in Britain would need to reconsider a wide range of connections between the Church of England and the state; in particular, legislation widely felt to privilege Anglicans in England over other denominations and faiths. The Race Relations Act 1976 has had a positive effect. However, a new Equality Act is required, together with a new Equality Commission. Furthermore, there needs to be a Human Rights Commission to promote a human rights culture, and the United Kingdom should formally declare itself to be a multicultural society.

      "body": "<p><strong>ENGLAND PREPARE FOR IMPORTANT FINLAND CLASH, REPORTS SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT MAD JOCK McDOOM FIVER</strong></p> <p>Doomed, doomed, I tell ye! The sky will rain hot coals in Finland tonight, not to mention long balls up from the back to try and take advantage of the unique qualities of Emile Heskey! Doomed! And what's worse, either England don't win and spear their World Cup prospects with a claymore, or they do and send Sgt Wilko to the head of the queue for the manager's job! Double doomed!</p> <p>\"I just hope I've had enough time to get my ideas across,\" Sgt Wilko said today as the heavens were rent asunder by the portents of, er, doom! \"We want all the negative aspects out of the way. We don't want self-pity. For me, the most important thing is the performance. Not so long ago we were beaten by Italy but still qualified. We can do the same again.\" But what's that? It's a flock of ravens a-nestling on Wilko's shoulder! Aieee!</p> <p>I tell you boy, I haven't seen anything like it since the skies above Oslo turned red and the pavements rose up to meet poor McDoom before England's vital World Cup qualifier in 1993! And I'd only been drinking since lunchtime! Arroooo! Next you'll be telling me that England have slipped down the Fifa rankings to 15th! They have? Noooo!! I'm going to have to sit down and calm myself by watching the game on free-to-air TV. Aiieeee!</p> <p>[Mad Jock McDoom was unable to complete his report as he went off to hurl himself on the black pointy rocks of Death Island]</p> <p><strong>AN OPERATION ON YOUR BECK</strong></p> <p>You could be excused for ignoring the last significant act Kelvin Koogan made when \"in control\" of the England football team. After all, snivelling in the toilets, admitting to being piss poor and walking away from one of the most high-profile jobs in the country thus leaving everyone in the ca-ca is one hell of a smokescreen. But forcing David Beckham to run about a sodden Wembley pitch carrying a niggling injury picked up in training - thus ruling him out of today's crucial World Cup qualifier against Finland - could turn out to be the thing we'll remember him by in time to come.</p> <p>Of course, Koog's decision will only turn out to be cataclysmically bad if, say, an under-employed left-back decides to wander forward at regular intervals and ping dangerous crosses into the box where large defenders with good goalscoring records and Barcelona players lurk. But if England lose while Beckham is back home awaiting test results which will determine if he needs an operation on his injured left knee, we'll know who to blame.</p> <p>Having said that, we don't want to seem relentlessly negative towards the Koog. No, really, we don't. Which is why it's only fair to point out the positive benefits of his superstar-knackering exploits. With Becks likely to be out for up to six weeks, Manchester United's threadbare squad is sure to feel the pinch - he'll definitely miss their top-of-the-table clash with Leicester on Saturday whatever happens. So just think, if England avoid humiliation in Helsinki and this season's Premiership is still exciting come December, Kelv's the man we have to thank. Gawd bless 'im, he did a lovely job!</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I was the only player from the squad not to take part in the pre-season camp. The only one, it's so unfair!\" - An adult response from Southampton defender Patrick Colleter, who is not in Glenn Hoddle's first-team plans. He's not in any way looking for a transfer back to a French club before Christmas is out, either.</p> <p><strong>SEE YOU DAUM THE COURTROOM</strong></p> <p>After all he's endured - lies, deceit, cutting off bits of his hair - it's a wonder Christoph Daum hasn't lost it. If it were Arnold Schwarzenegger, he would have stripped down to the waist by now, covered himself in man's make-up and shot loads of people with the biggest guns you've ever seen. But sadly for German action lovers - and let's face it, they must have those Chuck Norris haircuts for a reason - Daum and his cronies have started a war, not of hot lead, but of words.</p> <p>Today, these words are being directed against Bayern Munich's general manager Uli \"Chilling Wit' Ma Hoe\" Hoeness. Daum is suing him for defamation in the belief that it was he who started rumours of Daum snorting prostitutes and having sex with drugs. Paul Breitner, a former international teammate of Hoeness's, today claimed Hoe was out of order. \"Spreading rumours is the last thing to do, it's just repulsive. Either you are able to give evidence to back up your allegations or you are not,\" he said. \"There is only ever black and white if we talk about drugs.\" As far as the Fiver is concerned drugs are brown and white, but it may be different in central Europe.</p> <p>Cologne coach Ewald Lienen also believes the Hoe's behaviour has been reprehensible: \"From a moral point of view this has been the most disgusting affair the Bundesliga has ever seen.\" Mario Basler, who was sacked by Hoe two years ago, chimed in as well. \"It's always the same with Hoeness,\" said the Kaiserslaurten player. \"He blames somebody else for what has happened. I can only laugh about it!\" So can the Fiver. Ha ha ha. </p> <p>Sadly the Hoe is not of the same disposition and today continued his dispute with Daum by denying that he started the rumours and threatening to sue anyone who starts rumours about him having started the rumours. Which presumably includes Daum. What was the first casualty of war again?</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Arsenal look set to move for Feyenoord's Polish international goalkeeper Jurek Dudek. An 'insider' told Planet Football: \"It seems to me a sale to Arsenal cannot be avoided.\"</p> <p>Coventry are set to sign 21-year-old Hearts defender Gary Naysmith. Naysmith, who played for Scotland in their 2-0 victory over San Marino on Saturday, is rated as one of the best prospects in the SPL.</p> <p>Liverpool, who are already hoping to sign Croatian Igor Biscan this Christmas, are in the market for another defensive midfielder, according to Planet Football. The website claims the Reds want to sign Pierre Ducrocq from Paris St Germain after he impressed Gerard Houllier in France's friendly with Japan last weekend.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Forfar midfielder Dave Bowman will not play again until December after receiving a massive seven-match ban from the SFA. Bowman was sent off and given four red cards by referee John Fleming on Saturday during the 5-3 defeat by Berwick. \"The player has been reported for being sent off originally for two cautions,\" explained a SFA spokesperson. \"But he has also been reported for using foul and abusive language on three separate occasions and this amounts to another three orderings off giving a total of four.\"</p> <p>Aston Villa have signed Sheffield Wednesday striker Gilles de Bilde on loan for two months. The 29-year-old Belgian international is set to go straight into the squad for Saturday's match at Arsenal. </p> <p>Aston Villa striker Luc Nilis has begun his rehabilitation programme following the double fracture of his right leg against Ipswich last month. \"It was a nasty injury but his leg will get better.\", Villa physiotherapist Jim Walker said. \"His leg is no longer in plaster as he had an aluminium nail hammered down the bone and that will stay in place until it heals.

      "bodyText": "ENGLAND PREPARE FOR IMPORTANT FINLAND CLASH, REPORTS SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT MAD JOCK McDOOM FIVER Doomed, doomed, I tell ye! The sky will rain hot coals in Finland tonight, not to mention long balls up from the back to try and take advantage of the unique qualities of Emile Heskey! Doomed! And what's worse, either England don't win and spear their World Cup prospects with a claymore, or they do and send Sgt Wilko to the head of the queue for the manager's job! Double doomed! \"I just hope I've had enough time to get my ideas across,\" Sgt Wilko said today as the heavens were rent asunder by the portents of, er, doom! \"We want all the negative aspects out of the way. We don't want self-pity. For me, the most important thing is the performance. Not so long ago we were beaten by Italy but still qualified. We can do the same again.\" But what's that? It's a flock of ravens a-nestling on Wilko's shoulder! Aieee! I tell you boy, I haven't seen anything like it since the skies above Oslo turned red and the pavements rose up to meet poor McDoom before England's vital World Cup qualifier in 1993! And I'd only been drinking since lunchtime! Arroooo! Next you'll be telling me that England have slipped down the Fifa rankings to 15th! They have? Noooo!! I'm going to have to sit down and calm myself by watching the game on free-to-air TV. Aiieeee! [Mad Jock McDoom was unable to complete his report as he went off to hurl himself on the black pointy rocks of Death Island] AN OPERATION ON YOUR BECK You could be excused for ignoring the last significant act Kelvin Koogan made when \"in control\" of the England football team. After all, snivelling in the toilets, admitting to being piss poor and walking away from one of the most high-profile jobs in the country thus leaving everyone in the ca-ca is one hell of a smokescreen. But forcing David Beckham to run about a sodden Wembley pitch carrying a niggling injury picked up in training - thus ruling him out of today's crucial World Cup qualifier against Finland - could turn out to be the thing we'll remember him by in time to come. Of course, Koog's decision will only turn out to be cataclysmically bad if, say, an under-employed left-back decides to wander forward at regular intervals and ping dangerous crosses into the box where large defenders with good goalscoring records and Barcelona players lurk. But if England lose while Beckham is back home awaiting test results which will determine if he needs an operation on his injured left knee, we'll know who to blame. Having said that, we don't want to seem relentlessly negative towards the Koog. No, really, we don't. Which is why it's only fair to point out the positive benefits of his superstar-knackering exploits. With Becks likely to be out for up to six weeks, Manchester United's threadbare squad is sure to feel the pinch - he'll definitely miss their top-of-the-table clash with Leicester on Saturday whatever happens. So just think, if England avoid humiliation in Helsinki and this season's Premiership is still exciting come December, Kelv's the man we have to thank. Gawd bless 'im, he did a lovely job! QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I was the only player from the squad not to take part in the pre-season camp. The only one, it's so unfair!\" - An adult response from Southampton defender Patrick Colleter, who is not in Glenn Hoddle's first-team plans. He's not in any way looking for a transfer back to a French club before Christmas is out, either. SEE YOU DAUM THE COURTROOM After all he's endured - lies, deceit, cutting off bits of his hair - it's a wonder Christoph Daum hasn't lost it. If it were Arnold Schwarzenegger, he would have stripped down to the waist by now, covered himself in man's make-up and shot loads of people with the biggest guns you've ever seen. But sadly for German action lovers - and let's face it, they must have those Chuck Norris haircuts for a reason - Daum and his cronies have started a war, not of hot lead, but of words. Today, these words are being directed against Bayern Munich's general manager Uli \"Chilling Wit' Ma Hoe\" Hoeness. Daum is suing him for defamation in the belief that it was he who started rumours of Daum snorting prostitutes and having sex with drugs. Paul Breitner, a former international teammate of Hoeness's, today claimed Hoe was out of order. \"Spreading rumours is the last thing to do, it's just repulsive. Either you are able to give evidence to back up your allegations or you are not,\" he said. \"There is only ever black and white if we talk about drugs.\" As far as the Fiver is concerned drugs are brown and white, but it may be different in central Europe. Cologne coach Ewald Lienen also believes the Hoe's behaviour has been reprehensible: \"From a moral point of view this has been the most disgusting affair the Bundesliga has ever seen.\" Mario Basler, who was sacked by Hoe two years ago, chimed in as well. \"It's always the same with Hoeness,\" said the Kaiserslaurten player. \"He blames somebody else for what has happened. I can only laugh about it!\" So can the Fiver. Ha ha ha. Sadly the Hoe is not of the same disposition and today continued his dispute with Daum by denying that he started the rumours and threatening to sue anyone who starts rumours about him having started the rumours. Which presumably includes Daum. What was the first casualty of war again? THE RUMOUR MILL Arsenal look set to move for Feyenoord's Polish international goalkeeper Jurek Dudek. An 'insider' told Planet Football: \"It seems to me a sale to Arsenal cannot be avoided.\" Coventry are set to sign 21-year-old Hearts defender Gary Naysmith. Naysmith, who played for Scotland in their 2-0 victory over San Marino on Saturday, is rated as one of the best prospects in the SPL. Liverpool, who are already hoping to sign Croatian Igor Biscan this Christmas, are in the market for another defensive midfielder, according to Planet Football. The website claims the Reds want to sign Pierre Ducrocq from Paris St Germain after he impressed Gerard Houllier in France's friendly with Japan last weekend. NEWS IN BRIEF Forfar midfielder Dave Bowman will not play again until December after receiving a massive seven-match ban from the SFA. Bowman was sent off and given four red cards by referee John Fleming on Saturday during the 5-3 defeat by Berwick. \"The player has been reported for being sent off originally for two cautions,\" explained a SFA spokesperson. \"But he has also been reported for using foul and abusive language on three separate occasions and this amounts to another three orderings off giving a total of four.\" Aston Villa have signed Sheffield Wednesday striker Gilles de Bilde on loan for two months. The 29-year-old Belgian international is set to go straight into the squad for Saturday's match at Arsenal. Aston Villa striker Luc Nilis has begun his rehabilitation programme following the double fracture of his right leg against Ipswich last month. \"It was a nasty injury but his leg will get better.\", Villa physiotherapist Jim Walker said. \"His leg is no longer in plaster as he had an aluminium nail hammered down the bone and that will stay in place until it heals. The last thing on Luc's mind at the moment is playing again and we have not even spoken about it.\" Celtic striker Henrik Larsson has revealed he wants to end his career with the Glasgow club. \"As long as Celtic want me I will stay,\" he told the Daily Record. \"My family is happy in Scotland and that's what is important. My son Jordan is three now and growing up a Scot. He doesn't know anything else - Scotland is his home.\" Montrose have parted company with manager Kevin Drinkell following a poor start to their new campaign.

      "body": "<p>JK Rowling's \u00a3500,000 donation last week to the National Council for One Parent Families was more than just a goodwill gesture. The creator of Harry Potter, who is the mother of a seven-year-old named Jessica, has assumed the role of ambassador for this most put-upon of demographic groups. Speaking on behalf of the NCOPF, Rowling said it was high time that single parents were removed from the bottom of the social scrapheap. She was fed up, she said, with the hostile stereotype of single parents as \"feckless teenagers trying to get council flats\". </p> <p>In reality, a mere 3% of Britain's 1.8m single parents are teenaged. Six out of 10 have been married and are now separated, divorced or widowed. But according to the council, 60% still live in poverty. The working families tax credit has had some impact on single parent employment, bringing the number on benefits down below 1m, but the government does recognise that the social exclusion many suffer remains a problem. This week, the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, announced plans in his next budget to help more single parents get off benefits and provide for their children through paid employment. </p> <p>As a professional woman with a degree, Rowling had been shocked by the stigma she felt attached to bringing up her daughter alone. Despite teaching qualifications, and the support of friends from whom she could borrow money, she said it had been very difficult to haul herself out of poverty. Rowling acknowledged how much harder it must be for single parents who have none of her advantages. But what - behind the depersonalising statistics and rightwing rhetoric - is life really like for a struggling single mother? </p> <p>Debra Alexander, 38, knows all about the stigma attached to single parents on benefits. She lives in a three-bedroomed council house in north London with six of her seven children: Anthony, 18, Vanessa, 14, Michael, 11, Amelia, six, Terry, five and Robert, three. The eldest, Laura, now has her own flat. </p> <p>\"I remember when I was pregnant with Michael and one of the neighbours started tutting that I was on to my fourth baby and still not married. Another turned round and said: 'Look at what some of the other kids in the neighbourhood do round here. They jump on cars and pull down trees. You never see Debra's kids doing anything like that. You only ever see them outside if she's with them. What's married got to do with it? It doesn't make anyone a better parent.' I never heard any criticism from that neighbour after that.\" </p> <p>Alexander first became pregnant at 17 but having a child was hardly a passport to a comfortable life of subsidised \"fecklessness\"; instead, she and the baby's father were placed in a halfway house while they waited for a council home. \"We had to share a kitchen and bathroom with lots of others and just had the bedroom to ourselves,\" she says. \"It was so disgusting that I kept running home to stay with my mum.\" </p> <p>When Laura was born, Alexander says that for the first few months it was like playing with a doll. \"I remember one day when Laura was eight months old. I had just bathed, dried and put powder on her when she peed and I had to start all over again. I got so angry with her and was seconds away from slapping her. I felt as if she had done it to me on purpose. </p> <p>\"Instead of hitting her, I cuddled her. And at that moment I realised that this tiny, innocent baby who hadn't asked to be born needed me for everything she was going to want in her life and that I was the one who was going to provide it. Everything changed after that and I became much more relaxed with my babies. None of them have ever been rushed through childhood.\" </p> <p>More children followed Laura and the family moved into their current home. \"I never got much help from the fathers of any of my children,\" says Alexander. \"I think one of the reasons for that is that I learned to do everything myself. I remember climbing up to my loft, which doesn't have a staircase, a few weeks before Vanessa was born and lowering the pram down from there with one of the children's skipping ropes.\" </p> <p>Money has always been tight, but Alexander has become an expert financial manager and religiously saves child benefit for family treats and electrical goods. \"When Vanessa was a year and a half, I took the three children to Majorca. I had saved and saved to take them all and each time I collected the money I gave it to my sister Jill, who kept it in a bag in her freezer because she thought burglars would never find it there. It was such a lovely holiday and I cried my eyes out when we flew back into grey, rainy London.\" </p> <p>She has not managed a trip abroad with the children in the 12 years since. In other respects, through careful management of her resources, Alexander ensures that her children never go without. Still, she yearns to escape the benefits trap: her ambition is to be a midwife. Under various pilot schemes launched this week, lone parents will be able to study and train for up to 16 hours a week without losing benefits. But the big obstacle between Alexander and her dream is the \u00a32,800 cost of a midwifery course. </p> <p>\"At the benefits office they are keen to get single parents back to work but they want you to take any old job to get you off their hands,\" she says. \"I want to do something that I really want to do and that I know I'd be good at. I haven't had much encouragement there. But I will do it - with or without help. I'm saving up and one day I'll get that qualification and have my dream career.\" </p> <p>When Alexander was growing up she was never encouraged to aim high, and she is determined to instil different values in her own children. \"I saw Laura's old teacher recently and she asked what Laura was doing.

      "bodyText": "JK Rowling's \u00a3500,000 donation last week to the National Council for One Parent Families was more than just a goodwill gesture. The creator of Harry Potter, who is the mother of a seven-year-old named Jessica, has assumed the role of ambassador for this most put-upon of demographic groups. Speaking on behalf of the NCOPF, Rowling said it was high time that single parents were removed from the bottom of the social scrapheap. She was fed up, she said, with the hostile stereotype of single parents as \"feckless teenagers trying to get council flats\". In reality, a mere 3% of Britain's 1.8m single parents are teenaged. Six out of 10 have been married and are now separated, divorced or widowed. But according to the council, 60% still live in poverty. The working families tax credit has had some impact on single parent employment, bringing the number on benefits down below 1m, but the government does recognise that the social exclusion many suffer remains a problem. This week, the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, announced plans in his next budget to help more single parents get off benefits and provide for their children through paid employment. As a professional woman with a degree, Rowling had been shocked by the stigma she felt attached to bringing up her daughter alone. Despite teaching qualifications, and the support of friends from whom she could borrow money, she said it had been very difficult to haul herself out of poverty. Rowling acknowledged how much harder it must be for single parents who have none of her advantages. But what - behind the depersonalising statistics and rightwing rhetoric - is life really like for a struggling single mother? Debra Alexander, 38, knows all about the stigma attached to single parents on benefits. She lives in a three-bedroomed council house in north London with six of her seven children: Anthony, 18, Vanessa, 14, Michael, 11, Amelia, six, Terry, five and Robert, three. The eldest, Laura, now has her own flat. \"I remember when I was pregnant with Michael and one of the neighbours started tutting that I was on to my fourth baby and still not married. Another turned round and said: 'Look at what some of the other kids in the neighbourhood do round here. They jump on cars and pull down trees. You never see Debra's kids doing anything like that. You only ever see them outside if she's with them. What's married got to do with it? It doesn't make anyone a better parent.' I never heard any criticism from that neighbour after that.\" Alexander first became pregnant at 17 but having a child was hardly a passport to a comfortable life of subsidised \"fecklessness\"; instead, she and the baby's father were placed in a halfway house while they waited for a council home. \"We had to share a kitchen and bathroom with lots of others and just had the bedroom to ourselves,\" she says. \"It was so disgusting that I kept running home to stay with my mum.\" When Laura was born, Alexander says that for the first few months it was like playing with a doll. \"I remember one day when Laura was eight months old. I had just bathed, dried and put powder on her when she peed and I had to start all over again. I got so angry with her and was seconds away from slapping her. I felt as if she had done it to me on purpose. \"Instead of hitting her, I cuddled her. And at that moment I realised that this tiny, innocent baby who hadn't asked to be born needed me for everything she was going to want in her life and that I was the one who was going to provide it. Everything changed after that and I became much more relaxed with my babies. None of them have ever been rushed through childhood.\" More children followed Laura and the family moved into their current home. \"I never got much help from the fathers of any of my children,\" says Alexander. \"I think one of the reasons for that is that I learned to do everything myself. I remember climbing up to my loft, which doesn't have a staircase, a few weeks before Vanessa was born and lowering the pram down from there with one of the children's skipping ropes.\" Money has always been tight, but Alexander has become an expert financial manager and religiously saves child benefit for family treats and electrical goods. \"When Vanessa was a year and a half, I took the three children to Majorca. I had saved and saved to take them all and each time I collected the money I gave it to my sister Jill, who kept it in a bag in her freezer because she thought burglars would never find it there. It was such a lovely holiday and I cried my eyes out when we flew back into grey, rainy London.\" She has not managed a trip abroad with the children in the 12 years since. In other respects, through careful management of her resources, Alexander ensures that her children never go without. Still, she yearns to escape the benefits trap: her ambition is to be a midwife. Under various pilot schemes launched this week, lone parents will be able to study and train for up to 16 hours a week without losing benefits. But the big obstacle between Alexander and her dream is the \u00a32,800 cost of a midwifery course. \"At the benefits office they are keen to get single parents back to work but they want you to take any old job to get you off their hands,\" she says. \"I want to do something that I really want to do and that I know I'd be good at. I haven't had much encouragement there. But I will do it - with or without help. I'm saving up and one day I'll get that qualification and have my dream career.\" When Alexander was growing up she was never encouraged to aim high, and she is determined to instil different values in her own children. \"I saw Laura's old teacher recently and she asked what Laura was doing. She is doing really well now and studying for her accountancy exams, but she didn't do that well at school and was written off academically. The teacher had stereotyped her because of the family she came from and said to me, 'I suppose she must have about three kids by now.' She was very surprised when I told her she didn't and was working very hard.\" In spite of her circumstances, Alexander feels confident that she has always given her children the best in terms of love and guidance. \"I feel very proud to be my children's mother. Lots of people come up and tell me what a good job I've done with them and I know they're right. I can tell from the way they love me and the way they play. They're not perfect but they're certainly 99%.\" ... And the perks that go with a salary Brenda Lewin, 49, has a 21-year-old daughter, Natalie, and a 10-year-old son, Jacob. She has managed to work while bringing them up. \"I split up from Natalie's father when she was four and had to find a job because I had debts and a mortgage. It took me a year to find something and then I landed a high-powered job in sales. I was earning lots of money: I could afford expensive holidays and that sort of thing. But I never saw Natalie and had to rely on a nanny to look after her. \"When I had Jacob I knew that I wanted to do things differently and took a part-time job managing a website so that I could work from home, collect him from school and be there to help with homework. I think flexible working is much more possible now than in the 80s. There's no question that things have worked much better this way round. \"Although we're not living in poverty on benefits, there are still plenty of drawbacks to being a single parent. The child of a single parent doesn't have a right of appeal against you which she or he would have if there were two parents around. That's something I'm really sorry about because I feel every child should have that right.

Praise him, praise him, Pillock most profound! </p> <p>I picked the letter off the mat and contemplated it with a mixture of gratitude and dread.

      "body": "<p>Eleven and a half years ago, I had a baby. He burst out of me like a slippery torpedo - surprised, black-haired, fists flailing furiously. He grew into the sweetest, brightest child: funny, quick, curious, happy, eager to please. \"I love you, Mummy,\" he used to sigh, for no particular reason, as we walked along hand in warm, delighted hand. </p> <p>And though he did undoubtedly love me, I knew it wasn't just that. I knew that what he really meant was, \"I'm happy, Mummy. I like this world, I love living this life of mine.\" As I say, he was a sweet child. Sweet and small and manageable - all the best and most endearing aspects of his father and me, I liked to think, sheared off and rolled into one. </p> <p>Now, suddenly, my baby is big. I say suddenly because, just as books, relatives and older parents always warn you, it has all taken no time at all. Really. Early life - childhood, teens, twenties - drags along as if you had all the time in the world, but make a baby and suddenly there you are, hurtling towards the grave. Time evaporates when you're concentrating and nothing concentrates the mind like children. The baby moves on to solids, takes a first tottering step, says \"cat\" and before you have time to linger on the moment, he's big enough to carry your shopping. This is why parents fill photo albums so manically - to be certain that it all happened. Parenting devours time. Blink and the scowling, black-haired infant is a tall, tough-man, grown-up child. </p> <p>And my boy, my baby, where is he? Well, he's still there, but these days it is as though I'm staring at a once-familiar line drawing where the lines are growing steadily more blurred. He's not yet 12 and hasn't reached puberty - not physically anyway - but there's no doubt that he's moved into some strange emotional limbo. He's just - well, not so straightforward any more. Or do I just mean that he's not quite so much mine? </p> <p>That affectionate openness has gone. He's often cross, opinionated, argumentative, obsessed with justice (for himself), quick to flare. \"Come back,\" I want to say. \"I love you. Remember how you used to be happy with what you had: family life, spaghetti, colouring in.\" </p> <p>But each day, he looks beyond me, to a different horizon. Each day he wants more. He looks to his father for things that he knows I can't provide (the soothing, male certainty of facts, the benison of explanations, the thrill of new, shiny equipment, physical contact that's not just about cuddling), and he looks beyond us both at times. Hardly a moment goes by without something new coming between us, something else for me to take in. He's strangely goodlooking now. The back of his head has changed, is less instantly recognisable. He doesn't always say what I think he'll say. His room smells eerily of something other than child. His cat mopes ceaselessly around him as if she knows something I don't. </p> <p>And, God, listen to him, he thinks I know nothing. He tells me not to bite my nails, not to swear - then calls me a \"stupid bloody woman\" if I interrupt his innings to call him in to tea. Any request to pick up his clothes, tidy his room is met with a \"yesss\" hissed under exasperated breath. He's getting clever. He understands history, politics, seems undaunted by concepts I have somehow always ducked. He challenges me about everything, sends me up - and less gently than he mimics his father. He takes up an amazing amount of space in the house, seems to need more food only half an hour after finishing supper, goes to bed late, travels on the Tube alone. Last week he got a spot. </p> <p>And yet. He still won't eat green beans, let alone broccoli. He still mooches about in my bedroom as I put on my make-up, telling me about who said what to whom and what he thinks about this or that. We still go naked in front of each other without either of us noticing (and I keep making a mental note that soon this must stop - but when?). He tries earnestly to interest me in Warhammer, in the politics of Nintendo, asks me which actor I seriously think made the best James Bond: Connery, Moore or Brosnan? He reads adult novels much of the time, but couldn't resist the new Harry Potter as soon as his younger sister had finished it. </p> <p>He still comes to me if he feels ill or gets a splinter in his toe. Until quite recently, he worried about vampires coming in through his bedroom window and would take my hand if he thought no one was looking. And then one day (when was it?) he just didn't. He still wants a cuddle when I kiss him goodnight - though I suspect it's more to delay the moment of lights-out than because he craves contact. Yes, his motives are slipping and sliding. \"I love you, Mummy,\" he still says, but only if I give him money for chewing gum or a Nintendo magazine. </p> <p>Secondary school, too. Having sewed the last name tape on the last item of his new uniform, I root out his dusty old baby book in order to look up the immunisation dates demanded by the school medical form. There, among the laboriously plotted centile charts and catalogues of tetanus and whooping-cough jabs, I see the words \"25 February 1989: his first smile\". </p> <p>\"You smiled early,\" I tell him, \"Three and a half weeks. That's early.\" </p> <p>\"What's that mean?\" he grunts. </p> <p>\"Just that you're, well, a bit exceptional, really.\" (Of course he is: he's my boy, isn't he?) </p> <p>He says nothing. Looks at me with a mixture of exasperation and pity. </p> <p>Next day I walk him to the Tube - first day of term, first day of the rest of his life. \"By the way, Mummy,\" he says, \"I meant to tell you: please don't make me porridge for breakfast any more.\" </p> <p>\"But,\" I say, as we cross to the pavement, \"you love porridge.\" </p> <p>\"No. I hate your porridge. I've been meaning to tell you. I always have. I just ate it to please you.\" </p> <p>He's my boy, my baby. When we brought him home from the hospital and laid him on our bed, his little body wrapped in its white cellular blanket so marooned and fragile, I wept. \"But what is it?\" Jonathan said, \"Why are you crying?\" </p> <p>\"I just never want him to go on a motorbike,\" I said. </p> <p>\"Got your Tube pass?\" I ask him for the second time. </p> <p>He nods patiently. \"Goodbye, Mummy.\" </p> <p>\"Goodbye, boy. Take care. See you later.\" </p> <p>I struggle to stop myself saying anything else, but there is no need. He has already turned and is moving away from me, a dignified child-man in a black suit and tie and rucksack. I keep my eyes on him for as long as I can, frozen where I stand. I keep watching until I can't make him out any more, until he is just another dark head bobbing in the crowd.</p>",

And my boy, my baby, where is he? Well, he's still there, but these days it is as though I'm staring at a once-familiar line drawing where the lines are growing steadily more blurred. He's not yet 12 and hasn't reached puberty - not physically anyway - but there's no doubt that he's moved into some strange emotional limbo. He's just - well, not so straightforward any more. Or do I just mean that he's not quite so much mine? That affectionate openness has gone. He's often cross, opinionated, argumentative, obsessed with justice (for himself), quick to flare. \"Come back,\" I want to say. \"I love you. Remember how you used to be happy with what you had: family life, spaghetti, colouring in.\" But each day, he looks beyond me, to a different horizon. Each day he wants more. He looks to his father for things that he knows I can't provide (the soothing, male certainty of facts, the benison of explanations, the thrill of new, shiny equipment, physical contact that's not just about cuddling), and he looks beyond us both at times. Hardly a moment goes by without something new coming between us, something else for me to take in. He's strangely goodlooking now. The back of his head has changed, is less instantly recognisable. He doesn't always say what I think he'll say. His room smells eerily of something other than child. His cat mopes ceaselessly around him as if she knows something I don't. And, God, listen to him, he thinks I know nothing. He tells me not to bite my nails, not to swear - then calls me a \"stupid bloody woman\" if I interrupt his innings to call him in to tea. Any request to pick up his clothes, tidy his room is met with a \"yesss\" hissed under exasperated breath. He's getting clever. He understands history, politics, seems undaunted by concepts I have somehow always ducked. He challenges me about everything, sends me up - and less gently than he mimics his father. He takes up an amazing amount of space in the house, seems to need more food only half an hour after finishing supper, goes to bed late, travels on the Tube alone. Last week he got a spot. And yet. He still won't eat green beans, let alone broccoli. He still mooches about in my bedroom as I put on my make-up, telling me about who said what to whom and what he thinks about this or that. We still go naked in front of each other without either of us noticing (and I keep making a mental note that soon this must stop - but when?). He tries earnestly to interest me in Warhammer, in the politics of Nintendo, asks me which actor I seriously think made the best James Bond: Connery, Moore or Brosnan? He reads adult novels much of the time, but couldn't resist the new Harry Potter as soon as his younger sister had finished it. He still comes to me if he feels ill or gets a splinter in his toe. Until quite recently, he worried about vampires coming in through his bedroom window and would take my hand if he thought no one was looking. And then one day (when was it?) he just didn't. He still wants a cuddle when I kiss him goodnight - though I suspect it's more to delay the moment of lights-out than because he craves contact. Yes, his motives are slipping and sliding. \"I love you, Mummy,\" he still says, but only if I give him money for chewing gum or a Nintendo magazine. Secondary school, too. Having sewed the last name tape on the last item of his new uniform, I root out his dusty old baby book in order to look up the immunisation dates demanded by the school medical form. There, among the laboriously plotted centile charts and catalogues of tetanus and whooping-cough jabs, I see the words \"25 February 1989: his first smile\". \"You smiled early,\" I tell him, \"Three and a half weeks. That's early.\" \"What's that mean?\" he grunts. \"Just that you're, well, a bit exceptional, really.\" (Of course he is: he's my boy, isn't he?) He says nothing. Looks at me with a mixture of exasperation and pity. Next day I walk him to the Tube - first day of term, first day of the rest of his life. \"By the way, Mummy,\" he says, \"I meant to tell you: please don't make me porridge for breakfast any more.\" \"But,\" I say, as we cross to the pavement, \"you love porridge.\" \"No. I hate your porridge. I've been meaning to tell you. I always have. I just ate it to please you.\" He's my boy, my baby. When we brought him home from the hospital and laid him on our bed, his little body wrapped in its white cellular blanket so marooned and fragile, I wept. \"But what is it?\" Jonathan said, \"Why are you crying?\" \"I just never want him to go on a motorbike,\" I said. \"Got your Tube pass?\" I ask him for the second time. He nods patiently. \"Goodbye, Mummy.\" \"Goodbye, boy. Take care. See you later.\" I struggle to stop myself saying anything else, but there is no need. He has already turned and is moving away from me, a dignified child-man in a black suit and tie and rucksack. I keep my eyes on him for as long as I can, frozen where I stand. I keep watching until I can't make him out any more, until he is just another dark head bobbing in the crowd.",

Mr Yentob, a former controller of BBC1 and BBC2, is regarded as a important creative figurehead for the BBC who is good with talent and has a wealth of experience in both commissioning and making programming. But he is also renowned within the BBC for not being the best organised manager, making it even more important that the BBC find a good CCO for his mega-department. As one senior insider put it: \"Who is going to want to do that job for Alan Yentob?\" Meanwhile, controller of entertainment Paul Jackson, who is moving to Sydney to head Granada Media Australia, will not be replaced within DEC. Head of comedy Geoffrey Perkins, head of light entertainment David Young and head of comedy entertainment Jon Plowman will all now report direct to Mr Yentob. The BBC is also said to be close to announcing the appointment of Jane Tranter as genre drama commissioner for TV, ending months of speculation about the role. It is understood that both in-house and independent drama proposals will go through her. Another commissioning executive, who will report to Ms Tranter, is likely to be appointed to manage the indie drama side.",

Equity markets have a broader problem. According to the IMF, this has been the best year for the global economy since the late 1980s. But it has not been translated into the sort of earnings growth analysts and investors expected. Companies, having over-invested, are seeing costs rise while consumers remain price conscious. That is bad for shares. </p> <p>The US's appetite for spending has always been influenced by Wall Street's performance.

Fair enough, the euro is weak against the dollar because of perceptions about the relative strengths of the economies.

It's 27 years this month since the Yom Kippur war led to a fourfold increase in the price of oil. Fears of another outbreak of hostilities is negating recent efforts to push down the cost of a barrel of crude down to around $25 a barrel. Yesterday it was above $31 and rising.

Mr Dewar's death comes five months after he underwent major surgery to repair a defective heart valve and he had been on blood-thinning drugs as a consequence of that operation, and it appeared that this had been a factor in the haemorrhage. His ministerial colleagues - including deputy first minister Jim Wallace, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats in the Edinburgh Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition administration - held an emergency meeting to discuss the crisis that has hit the Scottish parliament. The government now faces the task of choosing a successor as leader of the party north of the border at a difficult time for Labour.",

      "byline": "Gerard Seenan",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>As he said the phrase which would pin his name to history, Donald Dewar allowed himself a smirk. \"There shall be a Scottish parliament\" - the first sentence of the Scotland Act, the deliverance of the first Scottish parliament in 300 years. \"I like that,\" he added.</p> <p>Against all modern odds - for Mr Dewar was ill-dressed, anti-spin, often mumbling and deeply unfashionable - the first Scottish first minister achieved every parliamentarian's dream of moving from the filigree of political tussle to the annals of history. His loss will be felt deeply by the Labour party - inside and outside of Scotland.</p> <p>More than any other figure, he dominated modern Scottish politics. His contemporaries - Gordon Brown and the late John Smith - made their name at Westminster. Mr Dewar, uniquely, made his at Westminster and in the Scottish parliament he created. Both these institutions will have to examine how they will adapt now he has gone.</p> <p>There was, of course, no appetite yesterday for the political manoeuvring which will follow his departure. He was a figure genuinely liked and respected within his party. But that manoeuvring will have to come soon. Although there will be no campaigning until after Mr Dewar's funeral, under the terms of the Scotland Act a successor must now be appointed within 28 days.</p> <p>There is no obvious choice to replace him. Bluntly, no Scottish minister has yet proved they are of sufficient calibre. The man who most obviously wants to take on the mantle is Henry McLeish; the trouble for the enterprise minister is that he may want it just a little too much.</p> <p>Mr Dewar's successor will be appointed through an electoral college made up of the Scottish parliamentary party, the trade unions and constituency parties. Mr McLeish will command broad support in each of these groups; he has long experience as a minister at Westminster and laterally Holyrood, which will undoubtedly play well.</p> <p>He does, however, have a habit of irritating his cabinet colleagues by leaking stories to the press. He also rarely enters the political ring when things, as they have so often for Labour recently, go wrong. Mr McLeish may have won the image of the biggest hitter left in Scottish politics, but this does not guarantee him victory.</p> <p>His greatest challenge will come from a man virtually unknown outside of Scotland: Jack McConnell, the finance minister. In the short time he has so far served, Mr McConnell has proved himself to be an able minister. For a brief period, his star was sullied by last year's lobbygate affair over accusations of cash for access to ministers. He was, however, cleared of any impropriety.</p> <p>Since then, he has steadily managed the Scottish budget while working behind the scenes in the unglamorous, but crucial job of wrestling power from the hands of truculent Scottish civil servants.</p> <p>Mr McConnell is the outsider. He is relatively untested and he carries with him a faint allusion that he would be prepared to take Scotland on a path quite different to Labour's agenda in London. Mr McLeish is tried, tested and safe - he is probably Labour's preferred choice.</p> <p>None of these men, however, were favourites of Mr Dewar. If yesterday's tragic events had not occurred, Mr Dewar planned to stand down one year after the next Scottish elections. His anointed successor would then have been the ferociously capable communities minister, Wendy Alexander. The election comes too early for her as it does for the talented health minister, Susan Deacon.</p> <p>In theory though, no election has to take place. Under the terms of the Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition deal, the Lib Dem deputy first minister, Jim Wallace, could step up to first minister. Labour, of course, would never allow this to happen. For the moment, Mr Wallace will take on Mr Dewar's duties, but he will not, ultimately, take on his crown.</p> <p>There is one further theoretical notion which will never be allowed to dip into reality. This election should take place free from Westminster interference. It will not. Labour in London may have had its interfering fingers burned over the Alun Michael debacle at the Welsh assembly, but its influence will still be felt here.</p> <p>\u0095 Read the full version of this story in tomorrow's Guardian</p>",

      "bodyText": "As he said the phrase which would pin his name to history, Donald Dewar allowed himself a smirk. \"There shall be a Scottish parliament\" - the first sentence of the Scotland Act, the deliverance of the first Scottish parliament in 300 years. \"I like that,\" he added. Against all modern odds - for Mr Dewar was ill-dressed, anti-spin, often mumbling and deeply unfashionable - the first Scottish first minister achieved every parliamentarian's dream of moving from the filigree of political tussle to the annals of history. His loss will be felt deeply by the Labour party - inside and outside of Scotland. More than any other figure, he dominated modern Scottish politics. His contemporaries - Gordon Brown and the late John Smith - made their name at Westminster. Mr Dewar, uniquely, made his at Westminster and in the Scottish parliament he created. Both these institutions will have to examine how they will adapt now he has gone. There was, of course, no appetite yesterday for the political manoeuvring which will follow his departure. He was a figure genuinely liked and respected within his party. But that manoeuvring will have to come soon. Although there will be no campaigning until after Mr Dewar's funeral, under the terms of the Scotland Act a successor must now be appointed within 28 days. There is no obvious choice to replace him. Bluntly, no Scottish minister has yet proved they are of sufficient calibre. The man who most obviously wants to take on the mantle is Henry McLeish; the trouble for the enterprise minister is that he may want it just a little too much. Mr Dewar's successor will be appointed through an electoral college made up of the Scottish parliamentary party, the trade unions and constituency parties. Mr McLeish will command broad support in each of these groups; he has long experience as a minister at Westminster and laterally Holyrood, which will undoubtedly play well. He does, however, have a habit of irritating his cabinet colleagues by leaking stories to the press. He also rarely enters the political ring when things, as they have so often for Labour recently, go wrong. Mr McLeish may have won the image of the biggest hitter left in Scottish politics, but this does not guarantee him victory. His greatest challenge will come from a man virtually unknown outside of Scotland: Jack McConnell, the finance minister. In the short time he has so far served, Mr McConnell has proved himself to be an able minister. For a brief period, his star was sullied by last year's lobbygate affair over accusations of cash for access to ministers. He was, however, cleared of any impropriety. Since then, he has steadily managed the Scottish budget while working behind the scenes in the unglamorous, but crucial job of wrestling power from the hands of truculent Scottish civil servants. Mr McConnell is the outsider. He is relatively untested and he carries with him a faint allusion that he would be prepared to take Scotland on a path quite different to Labour's agenda in London. Mr McLeish is tried, tested and safe - he is probably Labour's preferred choice. None of these men, however, were favourites of Mr Dewar. If yesterday's tragic events had not occurred, Mr Dewar planned to stand down one year after the next Scottish elections. His anointed successor would then have been the ferociously capable communities minister, Wendy Alexander. The election comes too early for her as it does for the talented health minister, Susan Deacon. In theory though, no election has to take place. Under the terms of the Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition deal, the Lib Dem deputy first minister, Jim Wallace, could step up to first minister. Labour, of course, would never allow this to happen. For the moment, Mr Wallace will take on Mr Dewar's duties, but he will not, ultimately, take on his crown. There is one further theoretical notion which will never be allowed to dip into reality. This election should take place free from Westminster interference. It will not. Labour in London may have had its interfering fingers burned over the Alun Michael debacle at the Welsh assembly, but its influence will still be felt here. \u0095 Read the full version of this story in tomorrow's Guardian",

After fiascos with passports and asylum seekers, Jack Straw's prison policy is in danger of continuing that pattern. </p> <p>Like his Conservative predecessor, he has shown little desire to follow the approach of earlier home secretaries with policies based on reducing the size of the prison population. Instead, numbers have grown remorselessly. With mandatory sentence lengths for severe crimes, to sate the public appetite for severe punishment, Straw clearly believes that \"prison works\". The result: large numbers of lifers, with scant hope of early release, could increase violence and disruption in already overcrowded prisons. </p> <p>Drug dealers are one target group for mandatory sentences. The danger in demonising any group is of missing shades of grey. Just as most homicides are committed by close relatives, so the majority of those sentenced for supply of drugs are small-time dealers using the money to support their habit. This is light years from the barons of the drug world, living off crime in luxury mansions. Yet the former, not the latter, will be caught by the application of \"three strikes and you're out\" to the criminal justice system. </p> <p>In the first comprehensive spending review, the criminal justice system secured substantial extra resources for drug treatment programmes and testing orders. These orders are being introduced nationally despite ambiguous evidence of effectiveness as seen in three pilot areas. They risk being an over-hyped but ineffective remedy, like child curfew orders and anti-social behaviour orders. By contrast, additional resources for treatment services in the community are minimal. The result is a logjam of prisoners, wanting such treatment, for whom no services are available. </p> <p>The Home Office reigns supreme in Whitehall turf wars on drug policy. Its prevention advisory service has extended its role into both drug education and treatment programmes, ruffling feathers in the education and health ministries. Yet the same department treats the idea of a rational debate about decriminalisation of cannabis use as if it were heresy. Such a debate might well conclude that the public health risks would outweigh the benefits, but current attitudes exclude any discussion. </p> <p>Good government is not responding to every populist campaign of the Sun or Daily Mail.

      "bodyText": "Home secretaries can be tarnished by failings in some outpost of the department's wide-ranging responsibilities. After fiascos with passports and asylum seekers, Jack Straw's prison policy is in danger of continuing that pattern. Like his Conservative predecessor, he has shown little desire to follow the approach of earlier home secretaries with policies based on reducing the size of the prison population. Instead, numbers have grown remorselessly. With mandatory sentence lengths for severe crimes, to sate the public appetite for severe punishment, Straw clearly believes that \"prison works\". The result: large numbers of lifers, with scant hope of early release, could increase violence and disruption in already overcrowded prisons. Drug dealers are one target group for mandatory sentences. The danger in demonising any group is of missing shades of grey. Just as most homicides are committed by close relatives, so the majority of those sentenced for supply of drugs are small-time dealers using the money to support their habit. This is light years from the barons of the drug world, living off crime in luxury mansions. Yet the former, not the latter, will be caught by the application of \"three strikes and you're out\" to the criminal justice system. In the first comprehensive spending review, the criminal justice system secured substantial extra resources for drug treatment programmes and testing orders. These orders are being introduced nationally despite ambiguous evidence of effectiveness as seen in three pilot areas. They risk being an over-hyped but ineffective remedy, like child curfew orders and anti-social behaviour orders. By contrast, additional resources for treatment services in the community are minimal. The result is a logjam of prisoners, wanting such treatment, for whom no services are available. The Home Office reigns supreme in Whitehall turf wars on drug policy. Its prevention advisory service has extended its role into both drug education and treatment programmes, ruffling feathers in the education and health ministries. Yet the same department treats the idea of a rational debate about decriminalisation of cannabis use as if it were heresy. Such a debate might well conclude that the public health risks would outweigh the benefits, but current attitudes exclude any discussion. Good government is not responding to every populist campaign of the Sun or Daily Mail. It is about managing effectively for results. Focus groups are no way to get clear policy outcomes.",

Staff normally in the field have been called back to their offices to deal with not just queries from prospective adopters, prompted by the week's publicity, but also calls from people who put their own children up for adoption perhaps 30 or 40 years ago. </p> <p>\"We get a lot of those calls and we are very sensitive to them,\" says Felicity Collier, BAAF's chief executive. \"We want people to have the opportunity to talk about feelings that perhaps have been buried for quite a long time.\" </p> <p>It is a sobering reminder that adoption is the most complex of issues, tugging at the deepest human emotions, and one that is far removed from the political knockabout in which it is all too often caught up. As Collier well knows, the simple caricature of would-be adopters being thwarted by feet-dragging, politically correct social workers is generally - though not always - well wide of the mark. </p> <p>Collier, five years at the head of BAAF after an earlier career in social work and probation, occupies the reasoned middle ground in the fraught adoption debate. Her association has in membership almost all social services departments in England, Wales and Scotland, as well as voluntary adoption groups and some 1,500 individuals. She could be expected to stand up for officialdom, yet she is not afraid to speak out when she feels children's interests are being harmed. </p> <p>Just this week, BAAF has published a thorough analysis, covering 1,800 of the 2,200 adoptions of children from care finalised in England in 1998-99. And while many of the findings are positive, Collier is concerned at the \"worryingly high\" number of adopted children who had experienced multiple placements while in care. </p> <p>Of all the children, 29% had been through four or more placements. Of those who had entered care under the age of 12 months, 44% had been through four or more placements, including any attempts to resettle them with their mothers. Collier says simply: \"That's horrendous.\" </p> <p>Inevitably, BAAF find itself torn by the recent focus on adoption. On one hand, it cautiously welcomes what Collier calls the \"clarity\" of the government's approach in wanting more children in care to have an earlier opportunity of being adopted. On the other hand, BAAF is wary of simplistic solutions, targets and naming-and-shaming of local authorities deemed to be backsliding. </p> <p>\"We are independent and we are not responsible for the failings that can occur,\" says Collier. \"But we do know the difficulties of making the incredibly complex decision formally to separate a child from their birth family. You always have to get the balance right. It's remarkable that so many good and skilled decisions are made and most 'looked after' children are able, with support, to return home. But for others, adoption offers an important opportunity.\" </p> <p>Collier is using the platform offered by adoption week - a BAAF innovation, now in its fourth year - to remind the wider world that new adoption legislation is long overdue. The existing law dates from 1975 and reform promised by the Conservatives in 1996 never materialised. All eyes are now on the forthcoming Queen's Speech. </p> <p>In the absence of a legislative shake-up, based on hard facts, debate has tended to get bogged down in recriminations about social workers rejecting would-be adopters for being fat, for smoking, for seeing nothing wrong in smacking, or for being too middle-class, too white or too heterosexual. Collier is frustrated and angered by the recurrence of such anecdotes. </p> <p>\"Fifty-seven per cent of adopters are from social classes 1, 2 or 3 - people who would not normally meet social workers, never mind have them visiting their home,\" she says. \"It's a very stressful process, but you are dealing with the welfare of a child who is likely to have been badly messed around and who will need patching up again if the adoption placement breaks down. </p> <p>\"As for smoking, the average age of an adoptive parent is almost 39. One in four adults who smoke will die early from a smoking-related disease. You want to see a child go to a fit, active parent who will be there to look after them through their childhood - and be around beyond.\" </p> <p>Collier, a highly energetic 53 who had her own first child at 18, admits BAAF was in difficulties when she arrived. \"Far more demands were being made upon it than there were the staff or capacity to respond,\" she says. \"There were problems offinancial stability, as affect many voluntary organisations, and a need for a new direction.\" </p> <p>Today, the organisation is robust and taking a far broader view of adoption and fostering. Be My Parent, its magazine which profiles children seeking an adoptive or foster family, is now moving up to monthly publication. And while Collier has deep misgivings about internet adoption sites offering unfettered access to pictures and details of all children, she says: \"The reality is that people are much more likely to consider adoption when they see photographs of real children. That says something about our society.\" </p> <p>BAAF's new analysis of adoption data shows that 95% of adopters were married couples. Among the other 5%, there were just four men. Wary of being accused of promoting gay adoption, BAAF is nonetheless calling for more single people to be considered in an effort to reduce further the average 3 years 1 month spent in care by children at the point of adoption. In 1996, it was 3 years 8 months. </p> <p>For Collier, mother of three, stepmother of two and grandmother of three one-year-olds, the plight of very young children in care is distressing. \"When you look at babies in your own family, you know we have just got to do better,\" she says. \"It's that passion that motivates me.\" </p> <p>\u0095 BAAF is on 020-7593 2000</p>",

      "body": "<p>After London Underground driver Mohammed Mujahid's train ran over a man one cold February evening three years ago, he was, at least theoretically, at risk of becoming one of the capital's grim mental health statistics. One in five Londoners has a mental health problem, costing the capital \u00a35bn every year in lost employment and benefits payments - with work-related stress as well as anxiety or depression cited as lead causes. </p> <p>For tube drivers, having a person under the train - or more frequently and almost as bad, a near-miss incident usually featuring a drunk taking a leak on the rails - is a hazard that goes with the job and the shock can be long-term. \"You can't swerve to avoid someone when you're driving a tube train. There's nothing you can do except hope you're alert and that you've got time to apply the brakes and stop the train. It can really freak you out, leave you shaking and some people can't handle it and have to leave the company,\" says Mujahid. </p> <p>His experience, though, was rather different. Seeing the unconscious body of the man, who died in hospital hours later, shocked him deeply. \"He was in his mid-20s but he looked really young, like a child,\" he recalls. But instead of allowing the event to overcome him, Mujahid was able to cope well - at least partly through the support of a pioneering peer trauma support group for Central Line underground drivers that he himself helped to set up in 1994, and of which he is now chairman. After a selection procedure, volunteers are given three days' intensive training and are provided with continuing support from a counsellor, funded by London Underground. </p> <p>As an active volunteer, he is used to being called out to provide peer support for drivers who have witnessed an attempted suicide or had a near-miss incident. He has held their hands or listened to them shout or cry or sometimes try to make a joke of it. \"They don't realise they're in shock so our job is to make sure they get to hospital if they need it and that when they do get home, they're not on their own,\" he says. </p> <p>When his own incident occurred, Mujahid was given cups of tea by the station supervisor until the volunteer colleague arrived. \"Then we chatted, and the more I talked about what happened the more I felt relaxed. It made all the difference that I was talking to someone who understood completely what I'd been through. We could have a laugh together in the end. After all, we don't tell someone to jump in front of the train. It's not our fault.\" </p> <p>Mujahid, 39, is an adviser, and something of a figurehead, to the newly launched London-wide mental health campaign, whose slogan is: \"Who's responsible for London's mental health? You are. We are. London is.\" London mayor Ken Livingstone who pledges that mental health will be a top priority of the Greater London Authority, says of him: \"London has unique health needs and particular mental health needs to be addressed. Mohammed's excellent efforts with the trauma support group for tube drivers is just one exceptional example of how these needs are being met. </p> <p>The kind of peer support group Mujahid has helped to develop is now recognised as one of the most effective means of coping with routine stress as well as the traumatic crises that, for train drivers - and ambulance personnel and firefighters - can come with the job. In addition, the man himself has an almost fierce determination to help others, with a mind-set that equates a generous, giving lifestyle with happiness and good mental health. </p> <p>His biggest achievement, says Mujahid, who was born in Kashmir and arrived, aged eight, in Walthamstow, north-east London without a word of English, was to learn sign language. As an underground guard, he once found himself at a loss to talk to a family with two deaf children and decided that that position wasn't good enough. He was awarded a certificate at the end of the college course he took on sign language, the first he'd ever received, and he used it to become a volunteer in a job club for the deaf. \"It's so rewarding to make a phone call that persuades an employer that they can employ a deaf person to do filing and that the government will pay for, say, a flickering fire alarm. The pure joy, the glee on the person's face as they thank you for making that one call is just a wonderful experience,\" he says. </p> <p>Among other activities, he also provides respite fostering one weekend a month for a young white boy - something of an achievement for a divorced, childless, male member of an ethnic minority. \"I had to go through all sorts of hoops to be allowed to foster. But it's worth it to see the boy's face when I pick him up and he's waiting with his rucksack on, knowing that it's going to be time just for him,\" he says. </p> <p>He certainly doesn't mind when workmates seek him out to pour out their troubles. \"If someone needs to talk about their personal life or their financial problems, I can find five minutes out of my lunch break. I may not have the answers but I usually know who they should talk to.\" He's a refreshing change, though, from the image of voluntary work as pious do-goodery. He does it, he says, not because he's an especially good person but because he loves it. </p> <p>\"If you ask me how to have good mental health, it's by helping other people. It keeps my mind active and I love to feel that I've helped to make someone's life better. It just makes me feel so good.\" </p> <p>It's an attitude to which our stressed-out capital - full of rushing people, desperate to fulfil their potential, pile up material possessions and protect their time and space - should pay heed. Perhaps then fewer tube drivers would have to cope with those personal tragedies when a failed and lonely individual becomes \"a person under a train\". </p> <p> <strong>Stressed capital</strong><br></p> <p> \u0095 The London mental health campaign launched yesterday, which was world mental health day, will run for several months. It is backed by the NHS in London, the Department of Health and the Greater London Authority. </p> <p>\u0095 A total of 1,800 advertisements will appear on or in London buses, featuring people who have had mental health problems or experience of them. They include a footballer who tried to kill himself and a stall holder whose wife has Alzheimer's disease. </p> <p>\u0095 More than 250,000 leaflets will be distributed, and 20,000 posters displayed, encouraging people to look at mental health as an issue that concerns everybody and to ask for help if it is needed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "After London Underground driver Mohammed Mujahid's train ran over a man one cold February evening three years ago, he was, at least theoretically, at risk of becoming one of the capital's grim mental health statistics. One in five Londoners has a mental health problem, costing the capital \u00a35bn every year in lost employment and benefits payments - with work-related stress as well as anxiety or depression cited as lead causes. For tube drivers, having a person under the train - or more frequently and almost as bad, a near-miss incident usually featuring a drunk taking a leak on the rails - is a hazard that goes with the job and the shock can be long-term. \"You can't swerve to avoid someone when you're driving a tube train. There's nothing you can do except hope you're alert and that you've got time to apply the brakes and stop the train. It can really freak you out, leave you shaking and some people can't handle it and have to leave the company,\" says Mujahid. His experience, though, was rather different. Seeing the unconscious body of the man, who died in hospital hours later, shocked him deeply. \"He was in his mid-20s but he looked really young, like a child,\" he recalls. But instead of allowing the event to overcome him, Mujahid was able to cope well - at least partly through the support of a pioneering peer trauma support group for Central Line underground drivers that he himself helped to set up in 1994, and of which he is now chairman. After a selection procedure, volunteers are given three days' intensive training and are provided with continuing support from a counsellor, funded by London Underground. As an active volunteer, he is used to being called out to provide peer support for drivers who have witnessed an attempted suicide or had a near-miss incident. He has held their hands or listened to them shout or cry or sometimes try to make a joke of it. \"They don't realise they're in shock so our job is to make sure they get to hospital if they need it and that when they do get home, they're not on their own,\" he says. When his own incident occurred, Mujahid was given cups of tea by the station supervisor until the volunteer colleague arrived. \"Then we chatted, and the more I talked about what happened the more I felt relaxed. It made all the difference that I was talking to someone who understood completely what I'd been through. We could have a laugh together in the end. After all, we don't tell someone to jump in front of the train. It's not our fault.\" Mujahid, 39, is an adviser, and something of a figurehead, to the newly launched London-wide mental health campaign, whose slogan is: \"Who's responsible for London's mental health? You are. We are. London is.\" London mayor Ken Livingstone who pledges that mental health will be a top priority of the Greater London Authority, says of him: \"London has unique health needs and particular mental health needs to be addressed. Mohammed's excellent efforts with the trauma support group for tube drivers is just one exceptional example of how these needs are being met. The kind of peer support group Mujahid has helped to develop is now recognised as one of the most effective means of coping with routine stress as well as the traumatic crises that, for train drivers - and ambulance personnel and firefighters - can come with the job. In addition, the man himself has an almost fierce determination to help others, with a mind-set that equates a generous, giving lifestyle with happiness and good mental health. His biggest achievement, says Mujahid, who was born in Kashmir and arrived, aged eight, in Walthamstow, north-east London without a word of English, was to learn sign language. As an underground guard, he once found himself at a loss to talk to a family with two deaf children and decided that that position wasn't good enough. He was awarded a certificate at the end of the college course he took on sign language, the first he'd ever received, and he used it to become a volunteer in a job club for the deaf. \"It's so rewarding to make a phone call that persuades an employer that they can employ a deaf person to do filing and that the government will pay for, say, a flickering fire alarm. The pure joy, the glee on the person's face as they thank you for making that one call is just a wonderful experience,\" he says. Among other activities, he also provides respite fostering one weekend a month for a young white boy - something of an achievement for a divorced, childless, male member of an ethnic minority. \"I had to go through all sorts of hoops to be allowed to foster. But it's worth it to see the boy's face when I pick him up and he's waiting with his rucksack on, knowing that it's going to be time just for him,\" he says. He certainly doesn't mind when workmates seek him out to pour out their troubles. \"If someone needs to talk about their personal life or their financial problems, I can find five minutes out of my lunch break. I may not have the answers but I usually know who they should talk to.\" He's a refreshing change, though, from the image of voluntary work as pious do-goodery. He does it, he says, not because he's an especially good person but because he loves it. \"If you ask me how to have good mental health, it's by helping other people. It keeps my mind active and I love to feel that I've helped to make someone's life better. It just makes me feel so good.\" It's an attitude to which our stressed-out capital - full of rushing people, desperate to fulfil their potential, pile up material possessions and protect their time and space - should pay heed. Perhaps then fewer tube drivers would have to cope with those personal tragedies when a failed and lonely individual becomes \"a person under a train\". Stressed capital \u0095 The London mental health campaign launched yesterday, which was world mental health day, will run for several months. It is backed by the NHS in London, the Department of Health and the Greater London Authority. \u0095 A total of 1,800 advertisements will appear on or in London buses, featuring people who have had mental health problems or experience of them. They include a footballer who tried to kill himself and a stall holder whose wife has Alzheimer's disease. \u0095 More than 250,000 leaflets will be distributed, and 20,000 posters displayed, encouraging people to look at mental health as an issue that concerns everybody and to ask for help if it is needed.",

Two trees equals four pots of tea a day for six years; five trees planted soak up enough carbon to allow conscience-free driving in an average car for a year; 40 trees equal the average home's carbon dioxide emissions over five years; or seven trees buys carbon credits for five London to New York single air tickets. </p> <p>In theory, if you plant enough trees you can offset any polluting personal habits you may have; or, if you are an industry or a country, you can think big and cover whole regions in forests and become \"carbon neutral\".

The aim of the protocol is to reduce the industrial world's greenhouse gas emissions by 5% on 1990 levels as a first step to the 60% scientists say is needed. Kyoto was always seen as the beginning of greater things but if there is no deal in the Hague there is no other way forward for the treaty and we would all be sunk - literally, if the scientists are right and sea levels rise continuously for the next 300 years. </p> <p>A sink is a natural way of capturing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and turning it back into the solid carbon. Trees are the obvious example but the most potent sink is plankton which while living take carbon dioxide from the atmopshere to create their body mass and when they die \"sink\" to the bottom of the sea, taking the carbon with them. </p> <p>The reason the issue of sinks has become so important is that the US, the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, cannot reach its greenhouse gas reduction target under current domestic political measures. The economy has boomed so much since the baseline date of 1990 that carbon dioxide emissions would have to be cut back by as much as 30% on business as usual to reach the 2010 target of 7% reduction. </p> <p>President Clinton's advisers say they knew this in 1997 when the original deal was struck, which is why they insisted that credits for sinks, carbon trading and other deals outside the domestic arena were built in to the agreement. This issue has become the more urgent because in the last three years the US economy has boomed even more. As a result the scope for action at home to curb greenhouse gases is made more difficult, a fact not helped by the recent rise in petrol prices. </p> <p>So, for the US, sinks have become an ever larger part of the answer. Everyone wants more forests, they say - surely it's a winner. Superficially, the US is right: it is hard to object to the idea of sinks. Covering derelict land with trees, replacing long-cleared woods and forests, holds a great attraction. It also gives new value and possible protection to depleted forests, which might otherwise be cleared for agriculture. Credits should be allowed, says the US, for allowing secondary forests to regrow and fix carbon. </p> <p>The Americans and their allies, Japan, Australia and Canada, also argue for all sorts of credits for other land use - for example, direct injection of seeds into farmland rather than ploughing also prevents carbon escaping from the soil. </p> <p>The problem is that neat calculations about trees and cups of tea have so many uncertainties attached. On a large scale when the trees and undergrowth are growing in a new forest guestimates of carbon fixing could be millions of tonnes awry. As Michael Meacher, Britain's environment minister, and Jurgen Tritten, his German opposite number, put it in a joint statement on September 3, a wrong calculation on how much carbon is saved could bring a 20% increase in emissions, rather than the 5% decrease agreed as a first step under the protocol. The US accepts the science is uncertain although research is improving. To get round the problem the pro-sink countries are suggesting claiming only a percentage of the carbon saved - say 50% of the best guess. </p> <p>But even assuming calculations about carbon uptake of a new forest over the next 10 years could be agreed, what happens in 30 or 50 years when new woods begin to reach maturity? At least some of the wood should be harvested, potentially putting carbon back into the atmosphere. Worse, as this summer in the US has made plain, some forests burn down unpredictably due to lightning strikes. The third possibility is that as the climate changes the forests die anyway - as the scientists predict will happen to the Amazon by 2050. In any of these scenarios, what happens to the accrued carbon credits? Do they have to be repaid? </p> <p>A serious secondary problem for environmentalists is also the type of tree and forest planted. The best trees from the carbon point of view, fast-growing varieties which create bulk, such as eucalyptus or genetically modified poplar, are not going to create the sort of natural forests that are best for biodiversity. If big business demands maximum carbon for its bucks, wildlife will not necessarily benefit. There has even been proposals to clear natural forests and replace them with dense plantations of fast-growing trees to claim extra credits. </p> <p>To illustrate how far apart the various sides are at so late a stage in the negotiations, the US is demanding that there should be no cap on the credits it can gain for sinks - it could in theory create enough forests to achieve all its carbon dioxide reductions without taking a single action at home. The EU position is that all countries must achieve at least 50% of their targets through domestic action, a tall order for boom countries such as the US and Ireland.

      "bodyText": "It all sounds terribly neat. Two trees equals four pots of tea a day for six years; five trees planted soak up enough carbon to allow conscience-free driving in an average car for a year; 40 trees equal the average home's carbon dioxide emissions over five years; or seven trees buys carbon credits for five London to New York single air tickets. In theory, if you plant enough trees you can offset any polluting personal habits you may have; or, if you are an industry or a country, you can think big and cover whole regions in forests and become \"carbon neutral\". And all you need is money. No effort is required because all over the place there are companies springing up whose mission is to calculate how many trees you need, arrange places to plant them and guarantee that your efforts are properly certified and credited. But while some governments, notably that of the US, are wildly enthusiastic about storing carbon in new forests, and see it as a way of offsetting a large part of its emissions, Europe is dubious. Some environment groups regard it as downright dishonest , a get-out clause which allows an easy escape from taking domestic action to combat climate change. This will make the issue of carbon sinks, as they are known, the biggest single sticking point at climate talks in the Hague in November.

      "body": "<p>Disadvantage and deprivation are far removed from the life of Ali Khaleeli.With his background, there seemed little risk of him catching tuberculosis, which is known as the disease of poverty. Born to a wealthy family in southern Iran, Khaleeli was educated at an English public school and vaccinated against TB when 16. And by 1991, when he started suffering a dry cough, he was a healthy, badminton-playing 45-year-old diabetes consultant living in a village in affluent Cheshire. </p> <p>Certainly he had come into contact with TB patients during his career - but so had tens of thousands of other medical staff. When an X-ray revealed a shadow on his lungs, therefore, both his radiologist and chest physician felt there was only one conclusion - Khaleeli had lung cancer. \"You do not see a lot of tuberculosis nowadays,\" the radiologist replied, when Khaleeli suggested he might have that disease. </p> <p>It was only one day later, when a groggy Khaleeli awoke from a biopsy operation, that he was told that, indeed, he did not have cancer but tuberculosis. \"Although I was still under the effects of the anaesthetic, I shouted with relief,\" Khaleeli recalls. \"The anaesthetist said he had never seen anyone so happy to be told they had tuberculosis.\" </p> <p>TB is usually easily treatable with antibiotics - so Khaleeli had reasons to be thankful. Nevertheless, his diagnosis fitted into the bigger picture causing concern to TB doctors - that this highly infectious disease is returning to Britain at an alarming rate. Moreover, hospitals up and down the country are under-prepared for its resurgence. </p> <p>According to Public Health Laboratory Service figures, TB cases have been growing rapidly over the last 10 years. In one year alone, 1998-1999, cases in England and Wales rose 20%, from 4,659 to 5,658. The disease is most prevalent in poor, deprived areas such as east London, which has the highest rate of TB in the country. </p> <p>This rise has evoked so much apprehension that, last year, TB Alert was formed, making it the first British TB charity since the 1960s. \"It is true to say that tuberculosis is a slow timebomb in the UK,\" warns Peter Davies of the Liverpool tuberculosis research unit at University Hospital, Aintree. \"If it continues to increase at the present rate, the incidence of TB will, in two or three generations' time, be five or ten times what it is now.\" </p> <p>Before the introduction of effective drugs in the 1950s, TB thrived in the poor social conditions during and after the industrial revolution. The bacteria killed one in four white Europeans and Americans. But now it is mostly non-whites, like Khaleeli, who are coming down with the disease in this country. More than half (56%) of cases are in people born outside Britain, particularly sub-Saharan Africa and Asia where TB can be rife and treatment poor. </p> <p>Despite opinion that poverty remains the most significant underlying cause of TB in this country, Davies, who treated Khaleeli, places more emphasis on biology. \"My hypothesis, which is highly contested, is that white European and Americans who survived TB passed on a genetic resistance to the disease to their children,\" he says. \"Asian and African people may not necessarily have this innate resistance. Therefore I think the rise of TB in the UK is down to migration, pure and simple.\" </p> <p>Aware that such scientific speculation may be seen as having racist overtones, he adds: \"We can get around claims of xenophobia by remembering that TB is essentially a European export. So, in a sense, it is a disease which is coming home.\" </p> <p>Above all, it is British doctors' lack of familiarity and expertise in dealing with TB that worries specialists such as Davies. World Health Organisation guidelines specify that, in order to tackle TB effectively, there must be an efficient system of diagnosis and thoroughness in ensuring patients complete their course of treatment. Yet last year the British Thoracic Society reported that only 14% of 43 health districts had minimum staffing levels necessary to treat TB. </p> <p>\"It is down to individual doctors to recognise tuberculosis - but we now have two generations of doctors who have not, in their professional lives, seen tuberculosis,\" says Davies. \"Training is just not adequate, and this is something that, over the last 10 years, has driven me to distraction.\" </p> <p>Tight treatment procedures are all the more urgent when ineffectively treated strains of the disease can mutate to become \"multi-drug resistant\" (MDR), making it difficult - and expensive - to fight. </p> <p>One case of MDR tuberculosis can cost \u00a3250,00 to treat. When New York suffered an MDR outbreak 11 years ago, it cost \u00a3110m over four years to control it. In Britain, MDR cases were unheard of five years ago. But now, according to Davies, one in 50 is MDR. \"All the more reason to pay attention to the rise of TB,\" he emphasises. </p> <p>\"We have just seen Prince Charles and other celebrities put their support behind an anti-bowel cancer charity. If only we could get that kind of publicity for tuberculosis. But it is not an issue people want to raise because it is seen as a problem for other countries. Well, it is not.\" </p> <p>A fully recovered Khaleeli, who is convinced he caught TB from one of his patients, is one doctor who has learned the lesson. Each year, he presents a lecture on tuberculosis to staff at Halton General Hospital, near Runcorn, where he works. He is also considering researching the proportion of Asian and African doctors and nurses who have been infected with TB, possibly from patients. </p> <p>\"The treatment of tuberculosis and other infectious diseases was one of the things that made the British health system so good,\" he says.\"But tuberculosis has reared its head again, and it is particularly important we are on the look-out for it among Asian and African people. Surveillance is so vital to prevent its spread.\" </p> <p> <strong>Killer in the air</strong> <br></p> <p> \u0095 The tuberculosis bacteria spreads through water droplets in the air from coughs, sneezes or contaminated food. It causes fever, fatigue, loss of appetite and weight, night sweats and a persistent cough, with blood produced. </p> <p>\u0095 Overcrowding, inadequate sanitation, poor living conditions and homelessness are breeding grounds for the TB bacteria. </p> <p>\u0095 In 1993, the World Health Organisation declared TB, which kills 3m people a year, a global emergency. Infection with Aids virus HIV, which depresses the immune system, makes a TB carrier 30 times more likely to become sick with the disease. One in three Aids deaths is caused by TB.</p>",

The weekly visit to the nursing home was always overshadowed by the uncertainty familiar to any relative of a person with Alzheimer's. But Brown was stunned by what she heard as she left the home after one particular visit. </p> <p>\"A male resident, someone who had been friendly with my mother, rushed to meet us in his wheelchair,\" she recalls. \"He'd had a stroke, so he spoke slowly, but what he said was clear. He told me my mother had been raped.\" </p> <p>This was a nursing home run by a well-respected charity. But Brown was surprised and dismayed at the home's handling of such a distressing incident, both before she knew of the allegation and afterwards as inquiries were made. </p> <p>The Home Office has declared it intends to make it an offence for staff working in care homes to have sex with residents, as part of its review of the law on sex offences published in July. Proposals to improve standards in residential and nursing homes are also expected shortly. But critics say the moves fail to go far enough and there are calls for tighter safeguards in adult care homes, mirroring those in place in residential care for children. </p> <p>In Julie Brown's case, she was understandably horrified and confused by the allegation and returned immediately to her mother. \"The first thing I noticed was a large bruise on her hand, between her thumb and finger, as if she had pushed someone away,\" she says. \"She had had bruises on her hand before, but not there. I tried to question her. I asked her if anyone had done anything to her last night. But she didn't understand the question.\" </p> <p>Once the alarm had been raised, staff questioned the resident who had made the allegation and he repeated it. That day staff could not shed any light on the incident and Brown had to wait until 9pm, when the night staff took over, to try to find out more. When she telephoned, however, the night staff denied there had been any trouble involving her mother. All that could be gleaned was that an unsupervised male carer had changed her mother's incontinence pads. </p> <p>The following day, the head of the home informed Brown that they could not question the resident who had made the allegation, her mother or the carer in case it prejudiced any future inquiry. At that stage, Brown wanted the allegation investigated by police. The home eventually called the police in two days later - four days after the alleged incident. </p> <p>\"They arranged for my mother to see a police surgeon,\" she says. \"She had to endure an internal examination, but by then there was no sign that she had been touched. They questioned the carer and there was nothing in his background to suggest he had committed any offence before. </p> <p>\"The police said the home should have called them straight away. By the time they had, staff had changed the sheets and the bruising had faded.\" At that point, too, the resident who had made the allegation appeared to get cold feet and denied he had said anything. \"I wasn't at all satisfied. They'd flooded the home with police, but after three days what could they find?\" </p> <p>Not only was Brown unhappy with the way the home had dealt with the allegation, she was also concerned about staffing levels during the night and the fact that male carers were allowed to carry out intimate care for female residents. \"There are five floors in the home and one person on each floor,\" she says. Mostly that carer works on their own. If anything went wrong, some of the patients are so frail they couldn't press the bell.\" </p> <p>At a meeting, the home defended itself: managers said that equal opportunities laws meant it could not refuse to employ male carers and that staffing levels met current requirements. </p> <p>Concern about standards in residential and nursing homes is well documented. Fit for the Future, a consultation document commissioned by the Department of Health, sets out improved standards that each home will need to meet when the new Commission for Care Standards is up and running. It recommends that all homes have a written prevention of abuse policy and that all staff are trained to spot abuse. And it adds that same gender care should be \"provided for those residents wishing it wherever possible\". </p> <p>Gillian Crosby, deputy director of the Centre for Policy on Ageing, which prepared the report, says there is a gulf between the standards required of those caring for children and what is acceptable in residential care for adults. In residential child care settings, for instance, male members of staff avoid being alone with children in their bedrooms. </p> <p>However she recognises that bringing adult safeguards in line with those for children is also problematic. She says one of the challenges faced by those working with adults is how to balance their need for privacy with the need to protect particularly vulnerable people, such as those with dementia or severe learning disabilities. </p> <p>Ginny Jenkins, chief executive of the charity Action on Elder Abuse, agrees that greater protection has its drawbacks. \"If we treat vulnerable adults under children's laws, then we would be in danger of infantilising them.\" Although safeguards are essential, she asserts, it can be equally abusive to deny adults their privacy. \"If someone is 40 or 50 and a male carer takes them to the toilet, but keeps the door open, they are depriving them of their privacy.\" </p> <p>An easier solution is to pay more attention to recruitment, retention and training of staff, Jenkins argues. Homes should also ensure they have proper procedures in place for whistle blowing. And when allegations are made, they should always be dealt with promptly. </p> <p>Brown's experience, says Jenkins, is a common one. Care homes, even good ones, often treat elderly people like second-class citizens. There is still a long way to go before elderly people in residential care have the protection they need. </p> <p>As for Brown, she accepts that she will never know what happened to her mother. \"I can't get it out of my mind. Even though I've been told that the carer in question has now left the home, the thought that something might have happened makes me feel sick,\" she says. </p> <p>\"My mother may have been abused over a number of months.

Mr Barak has said he is willing to attend a US-hosted meeting to end the crisis, provided there is a further drop in Palestinian rock throwing and shooting attacks on Israeli settlers and soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza strip.</p> <p>The Palestinians, however, are not keen on Bill Clinton's efforts to convene a regional summit in the next few days. Yasser Arafat's adviser, Nabil Aburdeneh, said such a gathering should not be held before the Arab summit on 21 October.</p> <p>More than 90 people, mostly Palestinians, have been killed in clashes in the past two weeks. Today, several dozen Palestinians threw rocks at Israeli soldiers in the divided West Bank town of Hebron.</p> <p>The teenagers had broken away from a march of about 500 Palestinians protesting the presence of Jewish settlers in the city. \"Down with the olive branch, up with the rifles\" and \"Kofi Annan, we want a state\" read two of the banners.</p> <p>Near the West Bank settlement of Eli, a Jewish settler was killed when a car, driven by a Palestinian, overturned and struck a group of Israelis standing by the roadside. Police said they believed it was an accident, while settler leaders portrayed the incident as a terror attack.</p> <p>In the nearby settlement of Elon Moreh, hundreds of mourners joined the funeral procession of Hillel Lieberman, an American-born settler who was slain by Palestinian militants over the weekend, as he tried to reach the Joseph's Tomb enclave in the West Bank town of Nablus. Lieberman set out for Nablus on Saturday after he heard Palestinians were attacking the compound.</p> <p>In the Gaza strip, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy lay brain dead, a day after being shot by Israeli troops during a stone-throwing clash.</p> <p>The relative calm of the past few days was attributed, in part, to the presence of high-profile mediators. Mr Annan, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, European Union security chief Javier Solana and EU peace envoy Miguel Moratinos have been shuttling between Gaza and Jerusalem.

      "bodyText": "Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak today held a surprise meeting with UN secretary general Kofi Annan as an Israeli general reported a lull in the fighting. Army chief, lieutenant general Shaul Mofaz, said the violence was ebbing, but could erupt again. \"There is still a chance it could go the other way.\" Mr Annan is trying to mediate a truce and help win the return of three Israeli soldiers captured by Lebanese guerrillas. Mr Barak has said he is willing to attend a US-hosted meeting to end the crisis, provided there is a further drop in Palestinian rock throwing and shooting attacks on Israeli settlers and soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza strip. The Palestinians, however, are not keen on Bill Clinton's efforts to convene a regional summit in the next few days. Yasser Arafat's adviser, Nabil Aburdeneh, said such a gathering should not be held before the Arab summit on 21 October. More than 90 people, mostly Palestinians, have been killed in clashes in the past two weeks. Today, several dozen Palestinians threw rocks at Israeli soldiers in the divided West Bank town of Hebron. The teenagers had broken away from a march of about 500 Palestinians protesting the presence of Jewish settlers in the city. \"Down with the olive branch, up with the rifles\" and \"Kofi Annan, we want a state\" read two of the banners. Near the West Bank settlement of Eli, a Jewish settler was killed when a car, driven by a Palestinian, overturned and struck a group of Israelis standing by the roadside. Police said they believed it was an accident, while settler leaders portrayed the incident as a terror attack. In the nearby settlement of Elon Moreh, hundreds of mourners joined the funeral procession of Hillel Lieberman, an American-born settler who was slain by Palestinian militants over the weekend, as he tried to reach the Joseph's Tomb enclave in the West Bank town of Nablus. Lieberman set out for Nablus on Saturday after he heard Palestinians were attacking the compound. In the Gaza strip, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy lay brain dead, a day after being shot by Israeli troops during a stone-throwing clash. The relative calm of the past few days was attributed, in part, to the presence of high-profile mediators. Mr Annan, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, European Union security chief Javier Solana and EU peace envoy Miguel Moratinos have been shuttling between Gaza and Jerusalem. Foreign Secretary Robin Cook is expected to meet Mr Barak later today.",

      "body": "<p>Donald Dewar's destiny was to become Scotland's first minister, a glance at his life utterly convinces you of this.</p> <p>Every step seemed to drive him there, so much so that it became an almost cursory decision for Tony Blair to make him Scottish secretary after Labour's 1997 election victory, setting him on the road to lead Scotland's devolved parliament.</p> <p>Mr Dewar is a politician from the old school, and this has given his office a special kind of dignity that has endeared him to voters.</p> <p>He regularly resisted the approaches of New Labour's image-makers who urged him to ditch his 20-year-old overcoat. Only last year did he agree to jettison his trademark horn-rimmed glasses.</p> <p>He was born in 1937, and educated at Glasgow Academy and Glasgow University. Last year, he admitted he had been an \"isolated misfit\" in his youth, and said he regretted being an only child. He attributed his infamous public awkwardness to a troubled childhood, which he described as \"happy but limiting\".</p> <p>His schooling coincided with the war and he was sent to a small Borders school. He admitted that it was a major cultural change for him when he moved to Mosspark Primary School in Glasgow after the war.</p> <p>He has said: \"It was difficult and rough but Glasgow Academy was very tolerant, although I was not a star pupil by any means.\" And he added: \"At the end of school . . . elderly parents, single sex school, only child . . . I was remarkably socially inexperienced.\"</p> <p>After university, it was as a lawyer that he continued to develop the sharpness and verve that would later characterise his political debating.</p> <p>With professional parents and a middle-class background he explains his affinity with Labour as a \"sort of intellectual conviction\" which flourished at university. He said there were not many wild times for him at college but that he become very embroiled in the politically active student union.</p> <p>Mr Dewar has been a Labour Party activist since 1957 and has been fighting for devolution for most of his adult life. His reward, and the culmination of all his work, was overseeing the passing of the Scotland Parliament Act.</p> <p>Mr Dewar married Alison McNair in 1964, but the marriage ended in 1973 when she left him for the now lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, who was his university friend. The effect the end of the relationship had on him is reflected by the fact that he never remarried and barely speaks to his colleague. He has said: \"I was extremely happy for a number of years\u0085 sometimes things do not work out in the long term and you just accept that.\"</p> <p>He first entered parliament as an MP for Aberdeen South in 1966, but lost his seat in 1970. It took eight years for him to return as MP for Glasgow Garscadden. Now he represents Glasgow Anniesland.</p> <p>His affection for his native city is deep and he hates to leave his mansion in the leafy West End. He rarely holidays but although he claims to turn down cocktail party invitations \"by the gross\", the bookish politician insists he is not a recluse. He drives a 16-year-old Peugeot and has expressed his unease at climbing inside the government's plush vehicles.</p> <p>Mr Dewar served as a member of Labour's Scottish team in opposition between 1981 and 1992, when the then leader, John Smith, made him shadow social security secretary.</p> <p>In the final years of Labour's opposition, he proved to be an excellent chief whip, flying in the face of tradition by raising the public profile of the role with television appearances selling his party's policies.</p> <p>His life as first minister has not been without its challenges, and after the 1997 referendum his personal ratings fell during a rampant period for the SNP.</p> <p>But he fought back in the polls and during the parliamentary campaign he overcame the SNP's Alex Salmond as the people's choice for first minister.</p> <p>His political style has always shied way from \"stunts\" and soundbites, although he did call the numbers at a bingo game last April. His humour is sharp but not cruel and he has inspired affection among friends and foes alike.</p>",

Every step seemed to drive him there, so much so that it became an almost cursory decision for Tony Blair to make him Scottish secretary after Labour's 1997 election victory, setting him on the road to lead Scotland's devolved parliament. Mr Dewar is a politician from the old school, and this has given his office a special kind of dignity that has endeared him to voters. He regularly resisted the approaches of New Labour's image-makers who urged him to ditch his 20-year-old overcoat. Only last year did he agree to jettison his trademark horn-rimmed glasses. He was born in 1937, and educated at Glasgow Academy and Glasgow University. Last year, he admitted he had been an \"isolated misfit\" in his youth, and said he regretted being an only child. He attributed his infamous public awkwardness to a troubled childhood, which he described as \"happy but limiting\". His schooling coincided with the war and he was sent to a small Borders school. He admitted that it was a major cultural change for him when he moved to Mosspark Primary School in Glasgow after the war. He has said: \"It was difficult and rough but Glasgow Academy was very tolerant, although I was not a star pupil by any means.\" And he added: \"At the end of school . . . elderly parents, single sex school, only child . . . I was remarkably socially inexperienced.\" After university, it was as a lawyer that he continued to develop the sharpness and verve that would later characterise his political debating. With professional parents and a middle-class background he explains his affinity with Labour as a \"sort of intellectual conviction\" which flourished at university. He said there were not many wild times for him at college but that he become very embroiled in the politically active student union. Mr Dewar has been a Labour Party activist since 1957 and has been fighting for devolution for most of his adult life. His reward, and the culmination of all his work, was overseeing the passing of the Scotland Parliament Act. Mr Dewar married Alison McNair in 1964, but the marriage ended in 1973 when she left him for the now lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, who was his university friend. The effect the end of the relationship had on him is reflected by the fact that he never remarried and barely speaks to his colleague. He has said: \"I was extremely happy for a number of years\u0085 sometimes things do not work out in the long term and you just accept that.\" He first entered parliament as an MP for Aberdeen South in 1966, but lost his seat in 1970. It took eight years for him to return as MP for Glasgow Garscadden. Now he represents Glasgow Anniesland. His affection for his native city is deep and he hates to leave his mansion in the leafy West End. He rarely holidays but although he claims to turn down cocktail party invitations \"by the gross\", the bookish politician insists he is not a recluse. He drives a 16-year-old Peugeot and has expressed his unease at climbing inside the government's plush vehicles. Mr Dewar served as a member of Labour's Scottish team in opposition between 1981 and 1992, when the then leader, John Smith, made him shadow social security secretary. In the final years of Labour's opposition, he proved to be an excellent chief whip, flying in the face of tradition by raising the public profile of the role with television appearances selling his party's policies. His life as first minister has not been without its challenges, and after the 1997 referendum his personal ratings fell during a rampant period for the SNP. But he fought back in the polls and during the parliamentary campaign he overcame the SNP's Alex Salmond as the people's choice for first minister. His political style has always shied way from \"stunts\" and soundbites, although he did call the numbers at a bingo game last April. His humour is sharp but not cruel and he has inspired affection among friends and foes alike.",

With the betting slip in his teeth, he gallops down the last furlong of the rug, to the home straight of the lino. Words bolt from the side of his mouth: Yankee Piggott Photo-finish. I don't understand any of it: I think my father's English leaves a lot to be desired. </p> <p> He curses: Jesus Christ. </p> <p> At the end of the race, his face is very flushed, an inch from the set. He's watching the lines and dots as if Barney's Boy will suddenly leap through the screen. Ripping pink shreds of paper from his mouth, my father tears up his slip and spits the remains on the rug. Then he starts in on the Sporting Life, holding it out in front of him, rending it between his fists until he's tearing air. I know at these moments that he would tear me too, for the slightest thing, and I crawl ever so slowly behind the couch, until he's put on his donkey jacket and slammed the back door. </p> <p> He isn't just like this about horses. My father will gamble on anything that moves. He won't do Bingo or fruit machines or snow on Christmas Day, but horses and pontoon and poker and dogs. My father's love is Chance. Look at that roulette wheel! Bet red, bet black, bet red, bet black. If he could place his bet Under Starter's Orders he would still change his mind over every fence. The Form makes no difference, the words don't make sense, and the odds at Joe Coral have no bearing on his stake. </p> <p> He has always been this way, according to my mother. She made her own bet on him, in November 1948, in the church of St Mark's, in a white lace gown. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> This is what happens just before I am born: it's 1960. My parents, Frankie and Mary, have five beautiful daughters, and a half-share in a cafe overlooking Cardiff docks. Salvatore Capanone, my father's oldest friend, owns the other half. The sailors on shore leave pour in through the red door to eat, and find a girl. My family lives above the cafe. They have two rooms; one long one, divided into bedroom and lounge by a thick toile curtain depicting scenes of the French aristocracy, and an airless back room which they call The Pit, because you have to climb down into it. My sisters inhabit The Pit, and my father has put a gate up in the doorway to stop Luca, who's only two years old, from climbing up the steps and falling down again. Luca swings her fat leg over the gate whenever my mother isn't looking, and falls from that instead. </p> <p> There is a third room, one more flight up. It has a square wooden table covered with worn green felt, and four vinyl-backed chairs stacked one upon the other. In the far corner is a window where a blind conceals the day. My mother never goes into this room; it's not hers to use. </p> <p> There is no kitchen. Every morning my mother trudges downstairs to the cafe to fetch food for my sisters to eat, which they do, sitting in a long line on the couch and watching the Test Card on the television in the corner, while she moves her washing from surface to surface, doing her impression of someone who is tidy. My father's old sea chest is the only storage space, filled with baby clothes. I'll be wearing them soon. My mother knows this, but she doesn't want to air the clothes because my father doesn't. Also, she's determined that I'm a boy this time, and so a lot of the shawls and bonnets and little woollen coats will be redundant, being mainly pink. </p> <p> Celesta, who's eleven going on forty, is helping to get Marina and Rose ready for school. They look like two turnips in their cream-coloured balaclava hats, and Celesta doesn't want to be seen with them. She wears a straw boater with a chocolate-brown ribbon, bought for when she goes to Our Lady's Convent School. She won't start there until next term, by which time the boater will have a distinctly weathered look, but at the moment she wears it all the time, even in bed. Fran has just begun at primary school. She draws angry pictures of bonfires using three crayons at a time. My mother pays no attention to this, having to deal with Luca now, and the prospect of me later. </p> <p> When the other children leave, my mother squashes Luca into her hip and goes downstairs to the cafe. She unbolts the front door, slipping off the heavy chain which swings against the wood, and paces the narrow aisle between the tables. At the furthest end, where the daylight doesn't stretch, are two booths and a long counter. Close to its brass lip sit a single smeared tumbler and a half-empty bottle of Advocaat. The air is sweetish here. A sleeveless Peggy Lee is propped against the gramophone in the corner - Salvatore has had a late night. </p> <p> My mother eases Luca into her high chair, and as soon as she is down, with the rush of cold around her thigh, she screams. She won't stop until she has something sticky on bread, or until my father comes back from the market and swings her in his arms. Luca can't understand why she isn't allowed to practise running. Salvatore used to let her, when my mother had to go and fetch Fran, or hunt the Bookies for my father. </p> <p> Frankie and Salvatore are a strange brace. My father is smooth and lean, well cut in his well-cut suit. His partner is softer, larger, with milky hands and brimming eyes. Every morning Salvatore puts a clean white handkerchief in the pocket of his apron to deal with the tears which will flow through the day. He blames the heat of the kitchen, rather than his childless wife or the plaintive tones of Mario Lanza. The air is full of music when Salvatore cooks. He plays Dino and Sammy, endless Sinatra, and his favourite, Louis Prima, who reminds him of somewhere not quite like home. The records are stacked in the plate rack on top of the counter, the plates haphazardly stowed beneath. Salvatore glides through the days and nights, dusting flour into the grooves of Julie London, wiping her clean with his napkin. And then he wipes his eyes. </p> <p> There is a delicate division of labour in this business. Salvatore is a better cook than Frankie, for whom the flames of the kitchen are too much like his vision of Hell. So while Salvatore cuts his fingers, brands the soft flesh of his forearm on the searing stove, and sings and cries, Frankie wears his suit and does things with money upstairs. But Salvatore likes it this way, he gets to see people. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> At first, convinced that it would tempt the passers-by, Salvatore made stews and bread and almond cakes dusted with sugar. He wedged the red door open with a bar stool, wafting the smell of baking out into the street with his tea-towel. He wrote a sign, DELICIOUS FOOD, in a careful hand, and tied it with parcel string around the rusted frame of the awning outside. But Mack the Knife spilt out on to the pavement, upsetting the barber shop owner next door, the sign ran in the rain, and soon Salvatore brought the stool back to the bar. The pigeons in the yard grew fat on unbought food. </p> <p> Never mind, said my mother. It takes time. </p> <p> Now he cooks for the sailors, who want egg and chips or bacon in starchy white rolls, and the cafe is busy. Sailors bring in girls, and girls attract trade. Salvatore fries everything in the flat black pan on the, stove, his thinning hair stuck to his head with steam. The combed strands come unglued throughout the day, falling one by one in lank array over his left ear. He pretends to be a widower so that the night girls will pity him. In fact he is married to Carlotta, who is respectable, and will not enter The Port of Call, our cafe. Or as Carlotta calls it in her broken English, That Den-o-Sin. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> Salvatore loves my mother and my father and my sisters. He is part of the family. And he will love me too, when I am born. Until then, he has to make do with Luca, who shrieks from her high chair the moment my mother's back is turned. Salvatore watches from a safe distance as Luca's arms jolt up and down in an urgent plea to be lifted. He would free her, but he daren't. The last time he did, she ran like a river to the end of the cafe and caught her head on the edge of a table. She stared at it, astonished, while her forehead bulged and split. The knock held her silent for two days, so silent, my mother thought she was damaged: it was the only time Luca was quiet. </p> <p> Now when my mother has to go out, she traps Luca in The Pit with soft toys to keep her happy for the five minutes she thinks she will be away. Luca throws them at the furthest wall, screaming like a bomb. </p> <p> In search of my father, my mother is blunt and shaming. She no longer has the time to be discreet. </p> <p> Have you seen Frankie? Len the Bookie? In The Bute, are they? Righto. She tracks down her husband, to the arcade, the coffee house, the back room of the pub. When she finds him, she is vocal. My father complains. </p> <p> This is business, Mary. Keep out of it. The other men look down and grin into their shirts. And when my father does return, my mother points to Luca's head. </p> <p> That's down to you, that is. Sufficiently shamed, or just tired of losing, Frankie starts a clean sheet. He stops betting; he has finished with it for good. But when my mother tells him about me (at six months the evidence is mounting), he takes the money he's accumulated through not gambling and opens a card school in the top room of the cafe. He wins, and wins. And suddenly I am luck personified. </p> <p> We'll call him Fortuno, he says, rubbing my mother's stomach as if she's harbouring the Golden Egg. My mother has other ideas. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> In the top room, all four chairs are occupied. There is a haze of cheroots, a sweat of onions, the stink of eggs in oil. My father has staked everything on the winning of the game. Away in the infirmary, I'm wailing at the midwife as Frankie decides to Twist. My mother is straining with the labour of prayer. Over and over. </p> <p> Oh God, let it be a boy. </p> <p> When the midwife pulls me out, she conceals me. I am shunted from scales to blanket to anteroom. She closes the door on my mother. </p> <p> If you have to tell her anything, tell her it's a boy, says the midwife to the nurse. </p> <p> Salvatore's wife Carlotta, waiting in the corridor with her big black handbag poised on the bulge of her stomach, catches just this one phrase - tell her it's a boy - and makes a phone-call to the cafe. </p> <p> Salvatore is watching the card game from the doorway upstairs, peeping through the curtain of beads which hangs from the lintel. They cascade from his shoulders like Madonna tears. He doesn't hear the telephone; his mind is in anguish for the game he's not allowed to play. His eyes are fixed on the Brylcreem glint which crowns my father's head. Salvatore's right hand rests stiff across his heart, his left holds a spatula, which oozes slow drips on to the red linoleum floor. He should be downstairs making greasy meals for the thin night girls, but Salvatore cannot concentrate on bacon and eggs when his business is at stake. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> Salvatore likes his partner Frankie, even though he's lazy and not always dependable, and he adores the night girls downstairs. The young ones perch on the stools, their bouffant heads nodding in time to the music on the gramophone; they are stiff-lacquered, clean-scented. The older ones smile, now and then flinging an arm across the booths to display their latest Solitaires. Or they sit in silence. They draw their wet fingers round the rim of their glasses, in an effort to make the last rum last. </p> <p> Rita, Sophia, Gina. Salvatore recites the girls' names in his sing-song voice. These women are really Irene and Lizzie and Pat. They close around the green metal ashtrays, depressing the buttons with their jewelled hands, watching the debris swirl into the hidden bowl below. When they do leave, the imprints of their bored thighs remain a while upon the shiny leatherette. They never say thank you and they never look back. Salvatore always forgives them. He wipes his hands down the breast of his apron, and sings through the night, while Frankie gambles in the room above his head. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> Tonight, Salvatore wants to watch. Here we have my father, the giant Martineau, Ilya the Pole, and crooked Joe Medora. This pack of men is busy. </p> <p> Sal ... telephone, says Joe, not looking up. Salvatore rolls reluctantly downstairs. </p> <p> Joe Medora wears a slouch hat, a silk scarf anchored at the neck, a Savile Row suit. He's an archetypal villain who makes sure he looks the part. He angles his cigar into the side of his lipless mouth, staring over his Hand. He's seen all the films; no gesture is wasted. He is patient. </p> <p> It's my father's move. Jack of Hearts, Five of Clubs, Four - winking - Diamonds. </p> <p> It's a boy! cries Salvatore, beating back upstairs. Bambino, Frankie! </p> <p> And my father, who is Frankie Bambina to his friends, poor unlucky Frank to have so many daughters, Twists in reckless joy, and loses the cafe, the shoebox under the floorboards full with big money, his own father's ruby ring, and my mother's white lace gown, to Joe Medora. </p> <p> At least I have a son, he thinks, as he rolls the ring across the worn green felt. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> My father stands above my cot with a clenched fist and a stiff smile. He rubs his left hand along the lining of his pocket, feeling the absence of his father's ring and the nakedness of losing. </p> <p> At the end of the ward, Salvatore's face appears in the porthole of the swing door. Carlotta's face fills the other, and for a moment they stare separately at the rows and rows of beds and cots. Carlotta lets out a shout, Mary! Frankie!, and sweeps towards my parents. Salvatore raises his hand in salute, but takes his time, pausing to exchange greetings with the other mothers. </p> <p> A fine baby, Missus! </p> <p> What a beauty! Boy or girl? </p> <p> Twins? How lucky! There aren't enough babies in the ward for Salvatore, perhaps not in the world. He bends over each one with his big smile and his hands clasped at his back. </p> <p> Carlotta spreads herself on the chair next to my mother's bed and rummages deep into her bag. She makes small talk, not trusting herself to mention me, or the cafe, or the future. My father stabs his teeth with a broken matchstick he's found in the other pocket of his trousers, and sucks air, and says nothing. No one looks at me. Then Salvatore approaches the foot of my mother's bed and opens his arms wide to embrace my father. Both men lean into each other, quietly choking. Carlotta produces a dented red box from her bag, prises off the lid, and offers my mother a chocolate. </p> <p> Please have one, Mary. They're your favourites. </p> <p> Mary is in a state of mute blankness. A girl baby, yet again. In her head, she wonders what to call me - she's exhausted her list of Saints' names on the boys she never bore, and is sick of all the arias in the names her girls have got. Dolores drifts up in miserable smoke. </p> <p> Salvatore rests a hand upon my mother's arm and gazes into my cot. The pink matinee jacket is fastened too tight around my neck; it reeks of mothballs. Wearing his best suit for the visit (which is also the one he wears to funerals), Salvatore smells the same as me. He lands great kisses on my forehead and holds me up for inspection, cajoling my mother. </p> <p> See, Mary! So pretty! </p> <p> My mother fixes on the flaking paint of the radiator, and wishes we would all go away. Frankie, too, has had enough of Cooing and Aahing. He puts his hand on Salvatore's chest and shunts him back down the ward. He presses so hard, Salvatore feels the buttons of his shirt indent his skin. </p> <p> Mary is in shock, my father tells them. Better leave her alone. This is nothing compared to the shock she'll get when she finds out she's homeless, and her wedding dress adorns a bottle-blonde from Llanelli. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p>I am a week old when everything changes. My parents move into a run-down house at one end of a winding street. The other end is dead, sealed by a high wall spun with barbed wire. Joe Medora owns our new house, and our old cafe. The rent increases on a whim: when Joe gambles on a loser, it goes up. But it can go up when he bets on a winner, too. </p> <p> My father is put in the Box Room: it is a cell. Celesta and Marina and Rose have the back bedroom. One window overlooks the road, where Rose leans out to spit on unsuspecting heads. Marina springs up and down on her bed, tearing off the wallpaper in long strips, while Celesta puts her fingers in her ears, reads The Book of Common Ailments, and convinces herself that she is dying. </p> <p> The front bedroom becomes Our Room, my mother and Fran and Luca and me. Fran has the bed in the corner, and Luca has exclusive rights over my mother, who puts me in the chest. When she's convinced that I'll survive the night, I'm allowed to share the bed. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> Carlotta is recruited in these difficult times, apparently to look after us children. She's really here to make sure my mother is a Good Wife who doesn't desert her fallen-on-hard-times husband: my mother might at any second run away with, say, the Coalman. This is prescient, but not in the way Carlotta thinks. </p> <p> For now, Salvatore still works at the cafe, renamed The Moonlight Club in sputtering neon, and he leaves his friend Frankie alone. But he thinks about us, he worries about me, and he asks Carlotta every night for a report. </p> <p> Getting big now, Carlotta says, stretching her arms out like a fisherman to show how I'm growing. </p> <p> Salvatore is not entirely convinced, and once a week he sends Carlotta with a parcel of food, stolen from his shifts at The Moonlight. He feels he is entitled; after all, he's still a partner in the business. Except these days, working with Joe Medora, he feels more like a slave. </p> <p> While my mother takes to her bed and stares at the ceiling, Carlotta cooks up a steam in the little kitchen. She makes baked pasta with blackened edges, solid slabs of home-made bread. Everything she provides is sharp and hard, as if to counteract the softness of her body and the thick roll of her voice. My mother thinks of little, but she listens. She hears the sticky cough of the woman in her kitchen, and imagines Carlotta dipping her feelers in the cooking pot, testing the saltiness of the ham. </p> <p> It is about this time that I am burnt. </p>",

Salvatore's right hand rests stiff across his heart, his left holds a spatula, which oozes slow drips on to the red linoleum floor. He should be downstairs making greasy meals for the thin night girls, but Salvatore cannot concentrate on bacon and eggs when his business is at stake. * * * Salvatore likes his partner Frankie, even though he's lazy and not always dependable, and he adores the night girls downstairs. The young ones perch on the stools, their bouffant heads nodding in time to the music on the gramophone; they are stiff-lacquered, clean-scented. The older ones smile, now and then flinging an arm across the booths to display their latest Solitaires. Or they sit in silence. They draw their wet fingers round the rim of their glasses, in an effort to make the last rum last. Rita, Sophia, Gina. Salvatore recites the girls' names in his sing-song voice. These women are really Irene and Lizzie and Pat. They close around the green metal ashtrays, depressing the buttons with their jewelled hands, watching the debris swirl into the hidden bowl below. When they do leave, the imprints of their bored thighs remain a while upon the shiny leatherette. They never say thank you and they never look back. Salvatore always forgives them. He wipes his hands down the breast of his apron, and sings through the night, while Frankie gambles in the room above his head. * * * Tonight, Salvatore wants to watch. Here we have my father, the giant Martineau, Ilya the Pole, and crooked Joe Medora. This pack of men is busy. Sal ... telephone, says Joe, not looking up. Salvatore rolls reluctantly downstairs. Joe Medora wears a slouch hat, a silk scarf anchored at the neck, a Savile Row suit. He's an archetypal villain who makes sure he looks the part. He angles his cigar into the side of his lipless mouth, staring over his Hand. He's seen all the films; no gesture is wasted. He is patient. It's my father's move. Jack of Hearts, Five of Clubs, Four - winking - Diamonds. It's a boy! cries Salvatore, beating back upstairs. Bambino, Frankie! And my father, who is Frankie Bambina to his friends, poor unlucky Frank to have so many daughters, Twists in reckless joy, and loses the cafe, the shoebox under the floorboards full with big money, his own father's ruby ring, and my mother's white lace gown, to Joe Medora. At least I have a son, he thinks, as he rolls the ring across the worn green felt. * * * My father stands above my cot with a clenched fist and a stiff smile. He rubs his left hand along the lining of his pocket, feeling the absence of his father's ring and the nakedness of losing. At the end of the ward, Salvatore's face appears in the porthole of the swing door. Carlotta's face fills the other, and for a moment they stare separately at the rows and rows of beds and cots. Carlotta lets out a shout, Mary! Frankie!, and sweeps towards my parents. Salvatore raises his hand in salute, but takes his time, pausing to exchange greetings with the other mothers. A fine baby, Missus! What a beauty! Boy or girl? Twins? How lucky! There aren't enough babies in the ward for Salvatore, perhaps not in the world. He bends over each one with his big smile and his hands clasped at his back. Carlotta spreads herself on the chair next to my mother's bed and rummages deep into her bag. She makes small talk, not trusting herself to mention me, or the cafe, or the future. My father stabs his teeth with a broken matchstick he's found in the other pocket of his trousers, and sucks air, and says nothing. No one looks at me. Then Salvatore approaches the foot of my mother's bed and opens his arms wide to embrace my father. Both men lean into each other, quietly choking. Carlotta produces a dented red box from her bag, prises off the lid, and offers my mother a chocolate. Please have one, Mary. They're your favourites. Mary is in a state of mute blankness. A girl baby, yet again. In her head, she wonders what to call me - she's exhausted her list of Saints' names on the boys she never bore, and is sick of all the arias in the names her girls have got. Dolores drifts up in miserable smoke. Salvatore rests a hand upon my mother's arm and gazes into my cot. The pink matinee jacket is fastened too tight around my neck; it reeks of mothballs. Wearing his best suit for the visit (which is also the one he wears to funerals), Salvatore smells the same as me. He lands great kisses on my forehead and holds me up for inspection, cajoling my mother. See, Mary! So pretty! My mother fixes on the flaking paint of the radiator, and wishes we would all go away. Frankie, too, has had enough of Cooing and Aahing. He puts his hand on Salvatore's chest and shunts him back down the ward. He presses so hard, Salvatore feels the buttons of his shirt indent his skin. Mary is in shock, my father tells them. Better leave her alone. This is nothing compared to the shock she'll get when she finds out she's homeless, and her wedding dress adorns a bottle-blonde from Llanelli. * * * I am a week old when everything changes. My parents move into a run-down house at one end of a winding street. The other end is dead, sealed by a high wall spun with barbed wire. Joe Medora owns our new house, and our old cafe. The rent increases on a whim: when Joe gambles on a loser, it goes up. But it can go up when he bets on a winner, too. My father is put in the Box Room: it is a cell. Celesta and Marina and Rose have the back bedroom. One window overlooks the road, where Rose leans out to spit on unsuspecting heads. Marina springs up and down on her bed, tearing off the wallpaper in long strips, while Celesta puts her fingers in her ears, reads The Book of Common Ailments, and convinces herself that she is dying. The front bedroom becomes Our Room, my mother and Fran and Luca and me. Fran has the bed in the corner, and Luca has exclusive rights over my mother, who puts me in the chest. When she's convinced that I'll survive the night, I'm allowed to share the bed. * * * Carlotta is recruited in these difficult times, apparently to look after us children. She's really here to make sure my mother is a Good Wife who doesn't desert her fallen-on-hard-times husband: my mother might at any second run away with, say, the Coalman. This is prescient, but not in the way Carlotta thinks. For now, Salvatore still works at the cafe, renamed The Moonlight Club in sputtering neon, and he leaves his friend Frankie alone. But he thinks about us, he worries about me, and he asks Carlotta every night for a report. Getting big now, Carlotta says, stretching her arms out like a fisherman to show how I'm growing. Salvatore is not entirely convinced, and once a week he sends Carlotta with a parcel of food, stolen from his shifts at The Moonlight. He feels he is entitled; after all, he's still a partner in the business. Except these days, working with Joe Medora, he feels more like a slave. While my mother takes to her bed and stares at the ceiling, Carlotta cooks up a steam in the little kitchen. She makes baked pasta with blackened edges, solid slabs of home-made bread. Everything she provides is sharp and hard, as if to counteract the softness of her body and the thick roll of her voice. My mother thinks of little, but she listens. She hears the sticky cough of the woman in her kitchen, and imagines Carlotta dipping her feelers in the cooking pot, testing the saltiness of the ham. It is about this time that I am burnt.",

He took only 10 Championship wickets this summer but his character shone through at crucial times, such as the National League Division Two match at Edgbaston in June. After making an unbeaten 41 in a total of 163 for 7, he then came on to bowl a crucial spell of three for 21 in nine overs to help Essex to a 24-run win over Warwickshire.

Kim Barnett, the former Derbyshire captain who is now part of Gloucestershire's all-conquering one-day side, is surely the unluckiest man to have just a single limited-overs cap. There was no first-ball nought for him: he took 84 off Sri Lanka at The Oval in August 1988. But the winter tour never happened, because the Indian government took exception to the choice of Graham Gooch as captain, and the following summer, under David Gower, Barnett got a few more Tests but no one-day encore.</p> <p> Mike Watkinson would have considered his single cap a bonus - just like those four precious Test caps he won under the regime of Ray Illingworth, who perhaps saw a little of himself in Watkinson's steady offspin and gritty batting. He saved a Test match with an unbeaten 80 against West Indies in 1995, but made less impact in his sole one-day game against South Afrcia the following winter - he didn't bat and bowled nine overs for 43.</p> <p> Paul Taylor, the Northamptonshire left-arm seamer, played his one game in Sri Lanka in 1992-93. His record is very much like Grayson's - none for 20 off three overs. He did make a run, though.</p> <p> Allan Wells is a member of both the One-Cap clubs. His single one-day appearance came against the West Indies at Lord's in 1995.

He was set to emerge as a useful member of the one-day side after starring for Scotland in last summer's World Cup, but he won his only cap in the Test arena. And what a stunning appearance it was.

Sources said the EU antitrust authorities only formally endorsed the merger after the companies agreed to several concessions, including ending ties with Bertelsmann, Europe's biggest media company. That move will prevent AOL \"from having access to Europe's leading source of music publishing rights, thereby eliminating the risk of dominance in the emerging markets for on-line delivery of music over the internet and software-based music players,\" it said. The companies also have provided guarantees that they will not unfairly discriminate against other companies that provide internet content or within the music industry. With the guarantees, the commission voted to approve the deal. EU authorities made quick progress on the issue after Time Warner last week dropped a separate joint venture plan with EMI Group of Britain, which would have created a major music company. European regulators had strongly opposed that deal.",

The beck, usually about 10 metres across and two metres deep, had been swollen throughout the day by rainwater from overnight storms. It lies at the western edge of the Yorkshire Dales in the shadow of Pen-y-ghent and close to the Settle and Carlisle railway line. The area is popular with walkers, cavers and school parties, but rivers in a landscape famous for its limestone rocks can turn from streams to torrents after the kind of continuous rain which has fallen for the past three days.

Speaking about the launch Home Secretary Jack Straw said: \"This campaign is about the simple action motorists and their passengers can take to outsmart the thief - parking in safe areas, using alarms and immobilisers, shutting windows, locking doors and not leaving things on display, will help deter the car criminal.\"",

Still their<br>fans expected better. Losing to Sri Lanka is no disgrace - they're a very<br>attractive side and I'd travel to the moon to watch them play. But they are<br>not the force they were in 1996 - they were themselves swept aside in the<br>next game by Pakistan - and getting beaten by 108 runs in a one-day match<br>is the equivalent of a 5-0 walloping at football. Even Venus Williams, who's<br>forgotten how to lose, can expect to work harder for her victories. The<br>fielding was appalling even by the Windies' recent low standards: they<br>seemed determined to keep the matchwinner Gunawardene at the crease, by<br>refusing to take the catches he offered.</p> <p>Brian Lara's form and state of mind continues to be a worry.

(p29)</p> <p>Cash-strapped online retailers are forced \"to the brink\" of redundancy according to a survey published yesterday by Goldfish. (p29).<br></p> <p><strong>THE INDEPENDENT</strong></p> <p>The Data Protection Commissioner, Elizabeth France, has issued a code of conduct containing strict guidelines to monitor employers' monitoring of their employees emails.

(p2).</p> <p>Ulster politicians were united last night in slamming the BBC's Panorama for naming the suspects in the Omagh bombing. They say naming them will not help the process of bringing them to justice. (p4)</p> <p>The US has rejected a package of guidelines set out by the United Nations' telecoms agency, the ITU, aiming to standardise and lower the costs imposed by telecoms companies for connecting international calls. (p12)</p> <p>The US telecoms regulator, the FCC, has accused television broadcasters of duplicity for lobbying for free digital bandwidth where mobile phone providers were paying a premium for the same service. (p14)</p> <p>Louise Kehoe reports on the increase in brand abuse by \"cybercriminals\". (p17)</p> <p>Parent company France Telecom is expected to have to pay around \u00a3268m in extra cash to Orange when it floats later this year, due to a sharp fall in the mobile operator's share price. (p28)</p> <p>Printing group St Ives is ascribing much of its increased profits, reported yesterday, to the growth of its e-commerce division. (p30) <br>Yahoo!'s third quarter results, announced yesterday, with the company's profits going from \u00a320m to \u00a367m, were in line with expectations but represented disappointing growth for analysts.(p33).</p> <p>T-Online's planned acquisition of I-D Media has hit an unexpected glitch following a disagreement over the new management structure. (p34).<br></p> <p><strong>THE TIMES</strong></p> <p>Panorama reporter John Ware has declined an offer from the BBC for protection, following his controversial Monday programme, in which the names of the four Omagh bomb suspects were named.

(p5) <br></p> <p><strong>THE SUN</strong></p> <p>The Sun splashes on Judy Finnigan's embarrassing faux-pas at last night's National TV awards. The Queen of Daytime revealed her ample bosom to \"millions\",writes Emily Smith, when she collected the Most Popular Daytime Programme award at the Royal Albert Hall. (p1)</p> <p>EastEnders' long-serving nice guy Mark Fowler will be told by a doctor next week that his HIV life sentence has been lifted, giving him a further 30 years.

(p4) Swimmer Eric \"the Eel\" Moussambani made it to the Sun's National Television Awards last night in spite of the ongoing diplomatic row. (p5)</p> <p>The Advertising Standards Authority has said ITV's claim \"Nobody Does It Better\" was justified, because its news programmes had won more programmes than the BBC. (p5)<br></p> <p><strong>THE MIRROR</strong></p> <p>The Mirror also celebrates the exposure of Judy Finnigan's boobs. (p1 and p13)<br></p> <p><strong>THE DAILY MAIL</strong></p> <p>The usually respectable Mail stops short of splashing on Judy, but can't resist a front-page photograph. (p1), with a full report on page 3.</p> <p>The Mail's diary notes that the Telegraph's chief executive Dan Colson is expected to give staff a ticking off for their continued campaign of complaints against cost-cutting in the staff canteen. (p17). <br>And the diary wouldn't be complete without a final dig at beleaguered Andrew Marr, the BBC's political editor, who has quit his post on the government's Commission on the Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain. (p5)</p> <p>ITV sports anchor Des Lynam is linked to an ongoing stalking case involving an \"international footballer\".</p> <p>The Mail says the BBC was \"emphatically right\" to broadcast the names of the Omagh suspects on Monday's Panorama.

      "bodyText": "Eric \"the Eel\" Moussambani seems to be getting into the habit of taking his time over things. After his record slow performance in the 100m freestyle, the Olympic swimmer has had a bit of trouble getting to Britain for an awards ceremony. Moussambani's journey from Equatorial Guinea already something of a marathon at four days almost had to be abandoned when his country's president threatened to prevent him from making the trip. Organisers of last night's National Television Awards wanted him at the Royal Albert Hall in London to present a gong, but President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo had pencilled the athlete in for a ceremony of his own. The president was so determined that his country's most famous athlete should attend a reception for Guinea's other Olympic contenders that he ordered Moussambani's plane to be intercepted in the neighbouring west African state of Cameroon. The jet was grounded for an hour while the British high commissioner, George Boon, and the awards programme producer, George Mitchell, argued for the swimmer to be allowed to travel on to Britain. The 22-year-old was eventually allowed to continue after Mr Boon persuaded the president that Moussambani's appearance on last night's awards show would increase the country's profile. Moussambani said after arriving in London yesterday: \"The president wanted to stage a reception for all the Olympic athletes, but I had to explain to him that I had already agreed to come here for the National Television Awards. \"He has delayed the reception until the end of the week. I'm very excited, I would never have dreamed of being able to come to London.\" The swimmer was taken from Heathrow to a tailor to be fitted for a suit and shoes, before presenting the award for Britain's most popular entertainment presenter. Davina McCall, Michael Barrymore, Chris Tarrant, Jim Davidson and Dale Winton were the nominees. Moussambani said he had left his home by boat on Saturday to travel to the Equatorial Guinean capital, Malabo, and then flown to Cameroon where his jet was delayed while the diplomatic wrangle over his departure was settled. He then flew on to Heathrow via Paris. He said his journey had been \"very relaxing\".

      "bodyText": "Increasing tension in the Middle East sent the price of oil surging on global markets last night, re-igniting fears of higher inflation in the developed economies. Saudi Arabia's warning that it would not remain aloof in the event of an Israeli attack on Lebanon or Syria helped to send the cost of a barrel of crude up almost a dollar to $32.79 (\u00a322.60) in New York. Earlier the International Energy Agency set alarm bells ringing when it said the West was heading into winter with inventories well below the seasonal norm. \"Fundamentals are tight and the market is fragile. The system is strained and running hard just to keep even. Vigilance is the order of the day,\" the IEA said. Oil prices have retreated from their 10-year peaks last month after pressure from the G7 industrial nations on pro ducers to pump more crude and the US decision to release 30m barrels from its strategic reserve. After briefly dipping below $30, prices have risen amid concerns that demand will exceed supply in the coming months, particularly if the violence in Israel leads to a broader conflict. \"Refiners can only process so much crude; ships, barges and pipelines can only transport so much product,\" the IEA said yesterday. \"The global energy market is coming to grips with the reality that there are physical lim its on what can be accomplished this winter.\" Oil prices are seen as a threat to the prospects of low inflation in the West, and yesterday's increases spilled over into bond markets, where worries about Wall Street and energy shortages had already driven yields higher. Britain and Germany yesterday reported higher than expected inflation figures, reflecting the recent surge in the cost petrol. Ernst Welteke, the Bundesbank president, said: \"I hope that no inflation expectations will build up in bond yields and wage demands.\"",

Lady Thatcher thought it the best birthday present she could have wished for, until someone explained: \"No Margaret, we mean British and German forces on the same side\".</p> <p>The idea of a European rapid reaction force has been gaining ground ever since the debacle of Kosovo, even though the words \"European\" and \"rapid\" do not sit comfortably together. The reasoning is that, with the Americans becoming less willing to finance military interventions, the European Union should have its own capability based in Brussels, to operate independently of Nato, which is based in, er, Brussels. Then European military powers like Britain and France could combine to launch operations without having to seek the approval of the US. Well, it worked so well over Suez, why not?</p> <p>It is claimed that language would not be a problem - apparently the European soldiers would find the British officer class just as incomprehensible as our squaddies always have done. But it's hard to imagine that in the heat of battle the odd second might not be lost. A British soldier would shout \"Enemy fire! Take cover!\" and all the French troops would get out their Petit Larousse dictionaries and eventually smile and reply: \"Yes, I am liking the Beatles also.\"</p> <p>The British government is one of the leading advocates of the so-called European defence identity - although if it came to any major conflict it might be politically difficult for our leaders to appear too enthusiastic. We would probably opt out of the single European army until conditions were right. Labour would insist we would not join any war until the five military tests were met, while the Tories would say that Britain would not invade anywhere for the lifetime of the next parliament. The outbreak of war would then be delayed while each of 15 member states organised a referendum.</p> <p>In fact, the Conservatives want all military operations to remain under the command of Nato, by which of course they mean the Americans, since Nato is basically the US plus the skinny kids who hover behind the legs of the biggest bully. The establishment of a European defence identity would at least bring military decisions back to the countries deploying the troops, but because the EU does not have a single president or prime minister, any military intervention would have to be agreed by committee. Why on earth would 15 different European heads of state want to use military force at once? They can't all have elections coming up at the same time. Any declaration of war would have to be organised like the Eurovision song contest: \"United Kingdom, Royaume Uni - can we have your vote please?\" Gerhard Schr\u00f6der would say into the microphone as Terry Wogan jested about the early casualty figures.</p> <p>With the planned eventual expansion of the EU to include Turkey, Chad and Australia, it's hard to know against whom they could launch an attack. If I was a soldier in Switzerland I would be getting very nervous, especially since the Swiss army only have those little penknives with which to defend themselves.</p> <p>\"Er sarge, do any of these blades fold out into a grenade launcher?\"</p> <p>\"Um, I don't think so - but there's a little pair of nail scissors there, you could really hurt someone with that.\"</p> <p>The deeper problem, of course, is not how to organise military intervention but whether it works or not. The people of Serbia did not overthrow Milosevic because Nato dropped bombs on them a few months back. And if Nato was sincere in its claim that it bombed Belgrade for humanitarian reasons, let's now see the same countries spend more on helping rebuild Serbia than they spent on the bombs that destroyed it.</p> <p>Any new force will soon learn that military action is always easier to embark upon than it is to curtail. Throughout history, political leaders have gone to war and found themselves in a longer conflict than they had expected. When poor Edward III got embroiled in the hundred years' war he said: \"Blimey, I didn't think it was going to go on this long.\" And his advisers said: \"Well, the actual name of your war might have raised the odd suspicion, your majesty\".</p> <p>If there's to be a European rapid reaction force, its use must be limited to emergency and humanitarian aid. They could try developing a full-blown European army but there would be only one outcome. Arguments would break out among the various European ethnic groups. Minor skirmishes between British, French and German troops would escalate, nation states would mobilise, and Europe would once more be plunged into all-out war.</p> <p>Still, I suppose it would save us having to make a decision on monetary union for another few years.</p> <p>\u0095 John O'Farrell's first novel, The Best a Man Can Get, has just been published by Doubleday.

But it's hard to imagine that in the heat of battle the odd second might not be lost. A British soldier would shout \"Enemy fire! Take cover!\" and all the French troops would get out their Petit Larousse dictionaries and eventually smile and reply: \"Yes, I am liking the Beatles also.\" The British government is one of the leading advocates of the so-called European defence identity - although if it came to any major conflict it might be politically difficult for our leaders to appear too enthusiastic. We would probably opt out of the single European army until conditions were right. Labour would insist we would not join any war until the five military tests were met, while the Tories would say that Britain would not invade anywhere for the lifetime of the next parliament. The outbreak of war would then be delayed while each of 15 member states organised a referendum. In fact, the Conservatives want all military operations to remain under the command of Nato, by which of course they mean the Americans, since Nato is basically the US plus the skinny kids who hover behind the legs of the biggest bully. The establishment of a European defence identity would at least bring military decisions back to the countries deploying the troops, but because the EU does not have a single president or prime minister, any military intervention would have to be agreed by committee. Why on earth would 15 different European heads of state want to use military force at once? They can't all have elections coming up at the same time. Any declaration of war would have to be organised like the Eurovision song contest: \"United Kingdom, Royaume Uni - can we have your vote please?\" Gerhard Schr\u00f6der would say into the microphone as Terry Wogan jested about the early casualty figures. With the planned eventual expansion of the EU to include Turkey, Chad and Australia, it's hard to know against whom they could launch an attack. If I was a soldier in Switzerland I would be getting very nervous, especially since the Swiss army only have those little penknives with which to defend themselves. \"Er sarge, do any of these blades fold out into a grenade launcher?\" \"Um, I don't think so - but there's a little pair of nail scissors there, you could really hurt someone with that.\" The deeper problem, of course, is not how to organise military intervention but whether it works or not. The people of Serbia did not overthrow Milosevic because Nato dropped bombs on them a few months back. And if Nato was sincere in its claim that it bombed Belgrade for humanitarian reasons, let's now see the same countries spend more on helping rebuild Serbia than they spent on the bombs that destroyed it. Any new force will soon learn that military action is always easier to embark upon than it is to curtail. Throughout history, political leaders have gone to war and found themselves in a longer conflict than they had expected. When poor Edward III got embroiled in the hundred years' war he said: \"Blimey, I didn't think it was going to go on this long.\" And his advisers said: \"Well, the actual name of your war might have raised the odd suspicion, your majesty\". If there's to be a European rapid reaction force, its use must be limited to emergency and humanitarian aid. They could try developing a full-blown European army but there would be only one outcome. Arguments would break out among the various European ethnic groups. Minor skirmishes between British, French and German troops would escalate, nation states would mobilise, and Europe would once more be plunged into all-out war. Still, I suppose it would save us having to make a decision on monetary union for another few years. \u0095 John O'Farrell's first novel, The Best a Man Can Get, has just been published by Doubleday.

Tina Smith, 31, who has three children, lashed out at staff at Willingsworth high school, Tipton, West Midlands, on two occasions after teachers expressed concerns about the conduct of her eldest son, Liam, West Bromwich magistrates heard. Sentencing Mrs Smith, who is unemployed, district judge Michael James said her actions in punching the headteacher, John King, and splitting his lip had been \"outrageous\". Mrs Smith, whose husband, Wayne, 33, was sentenced to 60 hours' community service after pleading guilty to assaulting three teachers during one of the incidents, admitted four counts of common assault at an earlier hearing. Mr James told the couple: \"It is all too prevalent in society today that people resort to violence to solve problems.\" Mr James also dismissed claims that Liam had been \"victimised\" by staff, saying: \"It seems that there were concerns about Liam's conduct and certainly Mrs Smith appeared incensed by the school's actions. \"She was, no doubt like many parents, quite unable to accept that any fault might lie with her son. \"In her state of anger and maybe frustration, Mrs Smith went to the school on two separate occasions and struck a number of people who I am satisfied made absolutely no move to offer any violence of any kind towards either of you. \"Teachers are regularly faced with angry, unreasonable and violent children and parents.

Griffiths, who worked at the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside at the time of the incident in May last year pleaded guilty to a charge of lying when he signed a declaration stating that he had no previous convictions on his job application. He in fact had three - one for making threats to kill and two for making obscene communications. The jury who cleared Griffiths of rape yesterday were not allowed to be told of his criminal past.

      "bodyText": "Four people were taken to hospital last night after the undercarriage of a plane collapsed on landing at Bournemouth airport following its diversion from Gatwick, where another aircraft was stuck in the mud after sliding off the runway. There were no casualties in either case but two adults and two children were taken to hospital \"as a precautionary measure\" after the nosewheel of the plane that landed at Bournemouth international airport gave way as it landed. The plane, carrying 40 passengers and four crew, was originally heading for Jersey from Gatwick but severe weather in the Channel Islands had forced the pilot to turn around and fly back. The twin-engined turboprop aircraft was then forced to divert to Bournemouth after a Boeing 767 carrying 146 passengers slid off the runway at Gatwick and got stuck in mud while landing in heavy rain. A spokeswoman for Bournemouth airport said: \"We can confirm that an ATR-72 aircraft operated by CityFlyer Express experienced a nosewheel collapse while landing at Bournemouth international airport.\" She added: \"A full emergency was declared and police, fire and ambulance were in attendance. There were no casualties but as a precaution two adults and two children were taken to hospital for a check-up.\" Glen Jones, the airport's managing director, said: \"We obviously take incidents like this very seriously but it was a relatively minor incident. We have had no other occurrences like this this year and it is a very rare form of accident.\" Air accident investigators from the Department of Transport examined the plane last night and the airport remained closed. Meanwhile, at Gatwick, emergency service teams were struggling to pull the Boeing 767 out of the mud. Airport officials closed the runway, forcing all inbound flights to divert to other airports including Luton, Heathrow, Stansted and Manchester. The Britannia flight from Manchester to Gatwick had landed safely, but slid off the runway into wet grass and mud as it taxied to its stand. A Gatwick airport spokeswoman said: \"At 7.50pm a Britannia 767 300 aircraft inbound from Manchester landed normally and safely at Gatwick. When the aircraft vacated the runway it left the taxiway and travelled into the soft wet verges at the side of the taxiway. All 146 passengers and crew were uninjured as a result of the incident.\" Passengers and crew were escorted from the Boeing 767 and on to coaches before being taken to the airport\u00d5s south terminal and put up in local hotels for the night. Fire crews later managed to drag the aircraft back on to the runway where safety checks were carried out. A spokesman for Britannia said engineers were checking the nosewheel of the aircraft and it was hoped the plane would be back in service this morning.",

Peter Connor, a councillor for community and social services, said: \"The city is facing a social timebomb. We are seeking urgent meetings with the government.\" The problems are compounded by troubles at Moorfield, which opened last years as a reception centre for children coming into care. Councillors ordered a second independent report after complaints from neighbours about the home's residents.",

The move, which would have seen the Supreme Governor of the Church in England praying with the head of Roman Catholicism, would have been interpreted as a hugely significant act of reconciliation fol lowing nearly 500 years of largely rancorous division since Henry VIII led the church in England away from Rome. It is understood from senior sources involved in organising the visit that the plan for private prayers was supported by both Buckingham Palace and the Vatican, but was dropped following fears that it would annoy extreme Protestants and Anglo-Catholics within the Church of England and reopen sensitivities concerning the Queen's role as head of the established church. It was made clear last night that George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was not consulted over the proposal for prayers. The Queen will now have a private audience, lasting no more than half an hour, with the Pope in the Vatican next Tuesday - hardly long enough for anything more than the usual exchange of diplomatic pleasantries.

This is a private visit.\" Suggestions that the Queen and the Pope might use the occasion of their meeting to apologise for wrongs committed on both sides during the religious persecutions of the 16th and 17th centuries have been firmly denied. The meeting will take place as part of a four-day state visit to Italy, during which the Queen will attend a state banquet given by the Italian president and visit Milan to see the newly-restored Leonardo fresco of the Last Supper. British monarchs have paid state visits to the Vatican several times over the last 100 years, the first being by King Edward VII in 1903, but always on the level of courtesy calls between heads of state. The Queen visited Pope John XXIII in 1961 and the current Pope in 1980 and the two also met at Buckingham Palace in during the papal visit in 1982.

Even during that generally acclaimed visit, there were protests from some fundamentalist Protestants including the Rev Ian Paisley. The Pope on his visit to Britain in 1982 was seen to defer to the archbishop but in a sign of ongoing sensitivities, the Vatican's publication last month of its controversial declaration of Dominus Iesus has caused outrage among Anglicans because of its traditional ist assertion that other churches are of lesser status. The move - seen as an attempt by conservative factions in the Vatican to exercise control and influence over an ailing papacy - runs counter to the Pope's earlier attempts to build bridges with other faiths.

But the stone-throwing and shooting has not stopped. Yesterday another Palestinian boy, this time a nine-year-old, took a bullet in the head. Dread and panic still stalk the promised land.</p> <p>The blame game rages on. For Palestinians, and much of world opinion, the culprit is clear: Likud leader Ariel Sharon started the trouble by swaggering onto that contested patch of holy Jerusalem turf revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and by Muslims as the site of the Al-Aqsa mosque. Sharon's crime has been compounded by an Israeli military which has used jeeps, tanks and even helicopters to rain down rubber bullets and worse on prepubescent boys armed with nothing more than rocks and slingshots.</p> <p>Most Israelis see it differently. The left admits that Sharon lit that fateful first spark and that the Israeli army has since used excessive force. But that leaves plenty of blame left to go round. They point the finger at Yasser Arafat and his Palestinian Authority. He has 40,000 policeman at his disposal, a quasi-army which could have quelled the Al-Aqsa uprising before it had even started. Arafat has crushed dissent among his own people before, he could have done it again. Nor, adds Israeli opinion, did Palestinian TV have to stoke the fires of rebellion by broadcasting archive pictures of the 1987-93 intifada: a kind of how-to guide to the new generation.</p> <p>There is almost no common ground between these two views, as Kofi Annan and co are doubtless discovering. But if consensus is impossible on the causes of the current war, agreement may be more likely on what it has cost.</p> <p>Everyone can see that more than a hundred people, mostly Palestinians, have lost their lives. They can agree, too, that the tentative trust that took seven years to build since the Oslo accords has evaporated, that both sides have returned to the hardline positions of more than a decade ago. Suddenly Israelis who had made a reluctant peace with the idea of an eventual Palestinian state are having second thoughts: that police force, they now fear, could soon be a full-fledged hostile army, on Israel's doorstep. For their part, Palestinians who had come to accept a two-state solution - one for them, one for the Israelis - are now back on a 1970s agenda, demanding Israel's destruction.</p> <p>There are two deeper shifts, which could well be felt for decades to come. The first is the well-documented inclusion of Arab citizens of Israel in the current rebellion. For 52 years, through five wars, the so-called Israeli Arabs kept their counsel, enduring often grotesque discrimination. They did not join the struggle of their cousins on the West Bank and Gaza; the intifada never spread inside Israel's borders. Their position was always ambiguous - members of the Palestinian people, yet citizens of a Jewish state - but they maintained it. Not now. The 52-year balancing act is over: the Palestinians of Israel are in revolt, too.</p> <p>The second, related shift is even more troubling. When Arafat and Israel's Ehud Barak met at Camp David in July they sat as two neighbours engaged in a land dispute, secular politicians tussling over borders and maps. Now the battle is no longer about real estate, but theology. The dispute over Jerusalem has turned a national conflict into a religious war - Jew against Muslim. Such a conflict does not recognise the \"green line\" that separates Israel proper from its occupied territories; it engulfs the Arabs of Haifa as well as Hebron. What's worse, it takes the Israel-Palestine conflict into a realm impervious to the secular, rational solutions of modern diplomacy: we have entered the realm of jihad.</p> <p>This spells doom for both sides. Barak's position has been rendered all but untenable. He was elected last year on a promise to make peace; he went further than any Israeli ever before to achieve that goal - and now he has been made to look a fool. He withdrew from Lebanon, agreeing an unofficial accord with Hezbollah, only for that group to kidnap three Israeli soldiers. He discussed with Arafat a deal that would have seen further Jewish holy sites placed under the protection of the Palestinian authority: after Joseph's Tomb in Nablus was sacked on Saturday - with Palestinians tearing the pages from Jewish prayer books - few Israelis will allow Barak to sign such a pact now. They will demand that Jewish holy sites remain under Jewish protection.</p> <p>Similarly, Barak was beginning to prepare Israelis to right a historic wrong: the dispossession of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees. Israelis were realising they would eventually have to open their doors and let those Palestinians return home. \"Now it is clear it would be madness,\" wrote Ze'ev Schiff for the left-leaning Ha'aretz newspaper yesterday, \"to add to [Israel's] Arab minority\" after so many have \"raised the banner of revolt.\" The last fortnight has convinced Israelis that the Arabs among them are a fifth column, and Barak cannot be seen to add to their ranks.</p> <p>Not that this is good news for Arafat. He will not be able to ride this wave of Muslim anger forever: if there is a jihad in Palestine, his people will want Hamas, not a secularist like him, to lead it. More immediately, can he not see what this confirmation of Israelis' worst fears will lead to? Does he not realise that the last two weeks have been the model election campaign for a new Likud government, headed by Sharon or a reborn Binyamin Netanyahu?</p> <p>Which brings us back to the blame game. For perhaps the real culprits are those two would-be peacemakers, Barak and Arafat. Neither man realised that doves must be as tough as hawks - that in proposing compromise they must be as unbending as the rejectionists who would do nothing. Barak should have barred Sharon from his walkabout. He should have maintained his surveillance operation on the border with Lebanon. He needed to do all this not to be a warlord, but to be a peacemaker - to prevent the violence that would make his own people fear compromise.</p> <p>The same applies to Arafat. He needed to push aside Hamas and the other rejectionists and to prevent the sacking of Joseph's Tomb - if only to reassure the Israelis with whom he is seeking an accommodation. But he should also have quieted the holy war propaganda, which can only make his fellow Palestinians regard his dealings with the Israeli enemy as treachery. Instead he has fed the appetite for jihad, so that even his own achievement in Oslo is in peril.</p> <p>There is a lesson here for peacemakers everywhere, including Northern Ireland. Those proposing compromise have to bend over backwards to provide security, to reassure their own side that peace is a risk they can afford to take. For if they slip up, their people will not easily agree to compromise next time: they won't be fooled again.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Israelis were realising they would eventually have to open their doors and let those Palestinians return home. \"Now it is clear it would be madness,\" wrote Ze'ev Schiff for the left-leaning Ha'aretz newspaper yesterday, \"to add to [Israel's] Arab minority\" after so many have \"raised the banner of revolt.\" The last fortnight has convinced Israelis that the Arabs among them are a fifth column, and Barak cannot be seen to add to their ranks. Not that this is good news for Arafat. He will not be able to ride this wave of Muslim anger forever: if there is a jihad in Palestine, his people will want Hamas, not a secularist like him, to lead it. More immediately, can he not see what this confirmation of Israelis' worst fears will lead to? Does he not realise that the last two weeks have been the model election campaign for a new Likud government, headed by Sharon or a reborn Binyamin Netanyahu? Which brings us back to the blame game. For perhaps the real culprits are those two would-be peacemakers, Barak and Arafat. Neither man realised that doves must be as tough as hawks - that in proposing compromise they must be as unbending as the rejectionists who would do nothing. Barak should have barred Sharon from his walkabout. He should have maintained his surveillance operation on the border with Lebanon. He needed to do all this not to be a warlord, but to be a peacemaker - to prevent the violence that would make his own people fear compromise. The same applies to Arafat. He needed to push aside Hamas and the other rejectionists and to prevent the sacking of Joseph's Tomb - if only to reassure the Israelis with whom he is seeking an accommodation. But he should also have quieted the holy war propaganda, which can only make his fellow Palestinians regard his dealings with the Israeli enemy as treachery. Instead he has fed the appetite for jihad, so that even his own achievement in Oslo is in peril. There is a lesson here for peacemakers everywhere, including Northern Ireland. Those proposing compromise have to bend over backwards to provide security, to reassure their own side that peace is a risk they can afford to take. For if they slip up, their people will not easily agree to compromise next time: they won't be fooled again. jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com",

Last night, Jagos Puric, the rector of Belgrade University, looked likely to be the next victim. More than 70 colleagues crammed into the smoke-filled chamber next to his office to vote on his dismissal. Speakers took the microphone to denounce him as a stooge imposed by Slobodan Milosevic to control staff and students after university autonomy was abolished in 1998.</p> <p>Lectures were suspended for the day but students lurked in the hallways to hear the outcome. \"He won't survive. He allowed himself to be used by Milosevic. We all knew it but couldn't do anything about it,\" said Petar Petrovich, 30, a student of Serbian literature.</p> <p>Mr Puric had not been seen since gathering his belongings from his office early in the morning. \"Don't reckon he'll be back in a hurry,\" a smiling porter commented.</p> <p>At the faculty of political science, meanwhile, a newly formed teachers' council dismissed Vladimir Stambuk, a dean and member of the Yugoslav Left, the party led by Mr Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic.</p> <p>On the outskirts of the city a police station was paralysed by officers' demands for the resignation of superiors who had tried to follow orders to suppress last week's protests.</p> <p>And strikers at the Kolubara mine persuaded the Serbian electric power company to sack or suspend senior executives, including the managing director, Milan Obradovic.</p> <p>Their colleagues at the RTB mine in Bor, near the Romanian border, dismissed their managing director and dissolved the board, while strikers at the 14 Oktobar machinery plant in Krusevac took over the running of the company after purging their board.</p> <p>In Nis, workers stormed the state-run textile factory, Nitex, and demanded that its management be dismissed.</p> <p>On it went. Any boss suspected of loyalty to the ousted president was at risk. But amid the euphoria, there was suspicion that the purges could mutate into personal vendettas and cronyism as the new elite manoeuvred for top jobs.</p> <p>\"A large number of people are hiding behind our name,\" said Zarko Korac, of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (Dos).</p> <p>But Zoran Sami, the vice-president of Dos, said that swift changes were necessary to stop the old regime exploiting the chaos. \"We have taken over some of these institutions only temporarily to prevent this plunder.\"</p> <p>President Vojislav Kostunica, promising \"a wave of democratic change\", has been leading the charge. He has installed his supporters into the police, judiciary, banks and state-run companies.</p> <p>At Genex, the largest state-run import-export company, the ousting of the perma-tanned, dapper Radoman Bozovic was accompanied by cheers. As the firm's head, the former prime minister had controlled an empire which allegedly lined Mr Milosevic's pockets. After resigning, he was jostled and barred from taking his limousine.</p> <p>Staff at the firm froze all financial transactions and called for the return of the former boss, Milorad Savicevic, who was forced to quit when Mr Milosevic rose to power.</p> <p>But not all the mighty fell. Borka Vucic clicked across the marble floors of Investbanka's offices on Terazije Street as usual. Some staff demanded that their boss, who allegedly ran slush funds for Mr Milosevic, leave the building for her own safety. She thought otherwise and remained at her first-floor desk.</p> <p>\"She is a witch.

      "bodyText": "The crowds may have melted from the streets but Yugoslavia's revolution is continuing, surging into factories and offices to oust bosses loyal to the old regime. Academics, miners, policemen, secretaries and chefs are among the employees sweeping managers from their jobs in a wave of popular revenge. Company directors are being escorted from their desks by strike committees determined to build a new country from the ground up. Last night, Jagos Puric, the rector of Belgrade University, looked likely to be the next victim. More than 70 colleagues crammed into the smoke-filled chamber next to his office to vote on his dismissal. Speakers took the microphone to denounce him as a stooge imposed by Slobodan Milosevic to control staff and students after university autonomy was abolished in 1998. Lectures were suspended for the day but students lurked in the hallways to hear the outcome. \"He won't survive. He allowed himself to be used by Milosevic. We all knew it but couldn't do anything about it,\" said Petar Petrovich, 30, a student of Serbian literature. Mr Puric had not been seen since gathering his belongings from his office early in the morning. \"Don't reckon he'll be back in a hurry,\" a smiling porter commented. At the faculty of political science, meanwhile, a newly formed teachers' council dismissed Vladimir Stambuk, a dean and member of the Yugoslav Left, the party led by Mr Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic. On the outskirts of the city a police station was paralysed by officers' demands for the resignation of superiors who had tried to follow orders to suppress last week's protests. And strikers at the Kolubara mine persuaded the Serbian electric power company to sack or suspend senior executives, including the managing director, Milan Obradovic. Their colleagues at the RTB mine in Bor, near the Romanian border, dismissed their managing director and dissolved the board, while strikers at the 14 Oktobar machinery plant in Krusevac took over the running of the company after purging their board. In Nis, workers stormed the state-run textile factory, Nitex, and demanded that its management be dismissed. On it went. Any boss suspected of loyalty to the ousted president was at risk. But amid the euphoria, there was suspicion that the purges could mutate into personal vendettas and cronyism as the new elite manoeuvred for top jobs. \"A large number of people are hiding behind our name,\" said Zarko Korac, of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (Dos). But Zoran Sami, the vice-president of Dos, said that swift changes were necessary to stop the old regime exploiting the chaos. \"We have taken over some of these institutions only temporarily to prevent this plunder.\" President Vojislav Kostunica, promising \"a wave of democratic change\", has been leading the charge. He has installed his supporters into the police, judiciary, banks and state-run companies. At Genex, the largest state-run import-export company, the ousting of the perma-tanned, dapper Radoman Bozovic was accompanied by cheers. As the firm's head, the former prime minister had controlled an empire which allegedly lined Mr Milosevic's pockets. After resigning, he was jostled and barred from taking his limousine. Staff at the firm froze all financial transactions and called for the return of the former boss, Milorad Savicevic, who was forced to quit when Mr Milosevic rose to power. But not all the mighty fell. Borka Vucic clicked across the marble floors of Investbanka's offices on Terazije Street as usual. Some staff demanded that their boss, who allegedly ran slush funds for Mr Milosevic, leave the building for her own safety. She thought otherwise and remained at her first-floor desk. \"She is a witch. Hanging from a tree is the best thing for her,\" said a female bank teller. \"She knows all Slobo's secrets so the new government needs her help in tracking down the money. But it's not right that she keeps her job. \"The other bosses are like snakes. For the past two weeks they didn't know which side would win; now they're wriggling from their skins.\" It would be a relief to no longer feign respect, but other staff reckoned it safer to hold their tongues. \"It's very sad, but Borka is a survivor,\" said the teller. \u0095 The French foreign minister, Hubert V\u00e9drine, indicted for war crimes, like other western leaders, by Milosevic's regime, was met with a mixture of applause and abuse as he toured old Belgrade yesterday. In talks with President Kostunica, Mr V\u00e9drine said a team of French specialists would arrive in Serbia this week to start assessing how the west can help repair the damage caused by Nato's bombing campaign.",

In Beirut yesterday, Hizbullah guerrillas stepped up their demands in return for the release of three Israeli soldiers kidnapped at the weekend. They said Israel must free 19 Lebanese men held illegally in Israeli jails for years, just to get information on the three soldiers. After a day of diplomacy, punctuated by threats and isolated violence in the West Bank and Gaza, Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, yesterday finessed his ultimatum to the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to end the violence or consider the peace process dead. The morning after the expiry of his earlier deadline, he said he was willing to give the Palestinians a few more days. \"If we find ourselves in a long, painful, difficult confrontation of many long months, there'll be no importance to our having held on for another 72 or 96 hours,\" Mr Barak said.

I think we have a window of opportunity to do it,\" he said. With Palestinian activists calling for all-out war, including attacks on some 200,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, and the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers, Mr Annan appears to have produced only a tentative peace. After the carnage of the past days - more than 90 dead, almost all Palestinian, and more than 2,000 injured - it is politically impossible for Mr Arafat to publicly declare an end to protests or to engage wholeheartedly in negotiations for a peace settlement. Yesterday, more than 1,000 Palestinian officials and intellectuals signed a petition deploring the killings and calling on Mr Arafat to suspend peace talks with Israel. The worst violence erupted in Gaza, where a boy, thought to be as young as nine years old, was declared brain dead after being shot in the head by Israeli soldiers. In the West Bank town of Hebron, Jewish settlers traded gunfire with Palestinian villagers overnight, and there were angry demonstrations in Ramallah.

      "bodyText": "A Sotheby's art expert, flicking through an album of drawings for a routine insurance valuation at Castle Howard, the mansion near York ,has uncovered a lost early Michelangelo, valued at up to \u00a38m. The drawing of a heavily draped woman is in superb condition, despite having been glued into the album almost 200 years ago. It is one of a handful of Michelangelo works still in private hands. The identification was made by Julien Stock, Sotheby's Old Master drawings expert, who was trawling through dozens of volumes of drawings in the library. Castle Howard has a renowned art collection in cluding several Holbeins and works by Rubens, Gainsborough and Reynolds Simon Howard, who lives in one wing of the house, which featured in the television version of Brideshead Revisited, said the discovery came as a surprise -but meant the immediate loss of the drawing to the house. The cost of insuring it would be prohibitive, he said. \"It should be on display in a national gallery or museum where everyone can enjoy it.\" James Millery, deputy chairman of Sotheby's, said: \"It's like finding part of the Holy Grail. Everyone is extremely excited. It is the most significant Michelangelo work to be discovered in living memory.\" There are major collections of Michelangelo drawings in the British Museum, in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and in the Royal Collection. Sotheby's is in discussions with the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh, which already has a number of works from Castle Howard. A spokeswoman for the gallery said: \"There is no Michelangelo in a public collection north of Oxford. This has left us with a great deal of thinking to do.\" The gallery's trustees will meet this week to decide whether to try to acquire the drawing, which has been offered as a private treaty sale. However, director Timothy Clifford has already expressed interest in another Michelangelo, a working drawing for his late sculpture of the risen Christ, sold at Christie's last summer for \u00a38.14m. It is believed to have been acquired for the Metropolitan in New York, but is likely to have a temporary bar imposed if an export licence is sought, allowing a British institution time to match the sale price.",

      "body": "<p>More than 100 people infected with the hepatitis C virus through receiving blood transfusions, blood products or organ transplants launched a high court claim yesterday that could cost the NHS millions of pounds in damages. </p> <p>The case is the first group action to reach court under the 1987 Consumer Protection Act, which came into force in March 1988 and was intended to allow people injured by a defective product to claim compensation without proving that the manufacturer or supplier was negligent. </p> <p>The act was brought in to implement the European directive on product liability, which imposed \"strict liability\" - without proof of fault - for defective products. Lawyers will be watching the outcome of the case closely because the act has proved problematic in practice and has been used seldom since it became law. </p> <p>The latest claims follow a compensation battle in the 1980s by people infected with HIV through blood, blood products and transplants. The government eventually settled those claims out of court in the early 1990s but has refused to compensate people infected with hepatitis C. </p> <p>The legal action at the high court in London, brought by 112 people represented by six \"lead\" cases, is expected to last three months. Michael Brooke QC, for the claimants, told Mr Justice Burton that those bringing the case had been infected over the years since March 1 1988, when the act came into force, and were infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) \"in a wide range of circumstances\". </p> <p>Some had transfusions after childbirth, during planned operations, or during surgery after an accident. Others were receiving treatment for blood disorders such as leukaemia. </p> <p>The claimants, who have been granted anonymity by the judge, have launched their claims against the national blood authority (NBA) in England and the Velindre NHS trust in Wales, which are contesting the action. The defendants are the NHS bodies answerable today for the production and supply of blood and blood products by the national blood transfusion service since March 1 1988, Mr Brooke said. </p> <p>The virus causes inflammation of the liver, but the long-term prognosis is uncertain in any particular case. Some people spontaneously \"clear\" the virus, meaning that traces of it no longer appear in their blood. Many do not experience symptoms or liver changes for a long time but have the threat hanging over them for years, Mr Brooke told the judge. Some people progress eventually to liver disease, cirrhosis and liver cancer, and the virus can be fatal. </p> <p>He said the court would have to investigate the discovery of HCV, which was identified in May 1988, and \"may have to consider the introduction of safety procedures to reduce the risk to people of being infected with the virus by blood and blood products, both as it in fact progressed in this country, and as it could have done\". </p> <p>For the defendants, Nicholas Underhill QC said there was no way that the risk of HCV infection could have been prevented at the time the Consumer Protection Act came into force in March 1988. </p> <p>He added: \"Mr Brooke is right to say that a time did come when a screening test did become available; and that that test was introduced later in this country than in most - though not all - other countries in the developed world. </p> <p>\"The NBA does not accept that the moment that the first country introduces screening, unscreened blood products in every other country automatically become defective.\" </p> <p>Mr Underhill said: \"There were good reasons why the national blood transfusion service (NBTS) in the UK did not move as fast as the fastest other countries. The NBA believes that the NBTS acted sensibly and appropriately in the measures taken for the introduction of screening and does not believe that there is any basis for legal liability.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "More than 100 people infected with the hepatitis C virus through receiving blood transfusions, blood products or organ transplants launched a high court claim yesterday that could cost the NHS millions of pounds in damages. The case is the first group action to reach court under the 1987 Consumer Protection Act, which came into force in March 1988 and was intended to allow people injured by a defective product to claim compensation without proving that the manufacturer or supplier was negligent. The act was brought in to implement the European directive on product liability, which imposed \"strict liability\" - without proof of fault - for defective products. Lawyers will be watching the outcome of the case closely because the act has proved problematic in practice and has been used seldom since it became law. The latest claims follow a compensation battle in the 1980s by people infected with HIV through blood, blood products and transplants. The government eventually settled those claims out of court in the early 1990s but has refused to compensate people infected with hepatitis C. The legal action at the high court in London, brought by 112 people represented by six \"lead\" cases, is expected to last three months. Michael Brooke QC, for the claimants, told Mr Justice Burton that those bringing the case had been infected over the years since March 1 1988, when the act came into force, and were infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) \"in a wide range of circumstances\". Some had transfusions after childbirth, during planned operations, or during surgery after an accident. Others were receiving treatment for blood disorders such as leukaemia. The claimants, who have been granted anonymity by the judge, have launched their claims against the national blood authority (NBA) in England and the Velindre NHS trust in Wales, which are contesting the action. The defendants are the NHS bodies answerable today for the production and supply of blood and blood products by the national blood transfusion service since March 1 1988, Mr Brooke said. The virus causes inflammation of the liver, but the long-term prognosis is uncertain in any particular case. Some people spontaneously \"clear\" the virus, meaning that traces of it no longer appear in their blood. Many do not experience symptoms or liver changes for a long time but have the threat hanging over them for years, Mr Brooke told the judge. Some people progress eventually to liver disease, cirrhosis and liver cancer, and the virus can be fatal. He said the court would have to investigate the discovery of HCV, which was identified in May 1988, and \"may have to consider the introduction of safety procedures to reduce the risk to people of being infected with the virus by blood and blood products, both as it in fact progressed in this country, and as it could have done\". For the defendants, Nicholas Underhill QC said there was no way that the risk of HCV infection could have been prevented at the time the Consumer Protection Act came into force in March 1988. He added: \"Mr Brooke is right to say that a time did come when a screening test did become available; and that that test was introduced later in this country than in most - though not all - other countries in the developed world. \"The NBA does not accept that the moment that the first country introduces screening, unscreened blood products in every other country automatically become defective.\" Mr Underhill said: \"There were good reasons why the national blood transfusion service (NBTS) in the UK did not move as fast as the fastest other countries. The NBA believes that the NBTS acted sensibly and appropriately in the measures taken for the introduction of screening and does not believe that there is any basis for legal liability.\"",

A British brigadier will be sent to Freetown with his own headquarters, while senior British officers will be attached to the UN force in the country and to UN headquarters in New York. Baroness Symons, the defence procurement minister, also told the Lords that up to 5,000 British troops - a brigade already on offer in principle to the UN - would if necessary be deployed in Sierra Leone. Senior British officials at a Nato defence ministers' meeting in Birmingham described the rapid reaction brigade as an \"over-the-horizon force\" that could go into Sierra Leone \"in extremis\". They insisted, however, that it would remain under British control, and ultimately under the command of the prime minister, and would not form part of Unamsil, the UN peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone. In the short term, the number of British troops in Sierra Leone will be increased from about 300 to at least 400, to step up training for the Sierra Leone army. A further 60 British soldiers are participating in an international advisory team. British officials said the moves did not amount to a \"massive mission creep\", and added that there were no plans \"at the moment\" for British troops to get involved in combat against rebels. The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, said British forces would be in Sierra Leone until at least next year. By placing a brigade headquarters - in the words of Baroness Symons - \"to command the overall UK effort and to provide high-level operational advice to the Sierra Leone army\", the government clearly believes that its earlier limited plans to help train the local soldiers were far too optimistic.

The area is popular with walkers, cavers and school parties, but rivers in a land scape famous for its limestone rocks can turn from streams to torrents after the kind of continuous rain which has fallen for the past three days. Police said the group of 15 boys and girls had been out river walking as part of a week long school trip to the Yorkshire Dales. A boy had also fallen into the beck but had been rescued by a teacher. As weather conditions deteriorated and night began to close in, residents from the village of Stainforth joined in the search for the two girls. When asked whether there was any hope of finding the them alive in the river, a spokesman from North York shire police said: \"Miracles do happen.\" A shop assistant working in Settle, 10 miles south of the search area, said that when he heard about the search, \"I phoned home immediately to check whether my little brother and sister were OK, but customers are telling me they [the missing teenagers] were on a school trip from Leeds.\" Roger Whittaker, spokesman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said rivers were at their most dangerous at this time of year as heavy rainfall combined with cold temperatures. Mr Whittaker emphasised that the only safe place to swim was a properly supervised pool or beach. Recent figures had shown that more and more children and young teenagers were drowning in rivers and streams across the UK. More than 54 children aged under 15 drowned in rivers last year, he said, compared with 36 in 1998.",

However, Mr Kaufman said: \"Our legal advice is that there is a very strong case that the gardeners are being unfairly treated by this draconian change in their contracts.\" He further claimed that British staff were essential to understanding the language and culture of those visiting the graves, giving the example of a poignant letter taped to a gravestone read by a gardener and preserved for the cemetery's museum. The commission said its British gardeners deserved great credit, but any implication that non-British staff lacked skills and dedication was misplaced A spokesman added: \"We are looking to talk to our staff and unions about pay structure. These talks could produce a pay increase.\"",

      "body": "<p>At a rather rightwing lunch last Friday, I expressed my pleasure at the popular uprising in Serbia which had toppled Slobodan Milosevic. \"Popular?\" a Tory gent harrumphed, in the way that only old Tory gents can. \"I think there's something deeply suspicious about it. Look at those cars and buses driving into Belgrade, led by a bulldozer to deal with police roadblocks. It wouldn't surprise me in the least to learn that the drivers had all been paid by the CIA.\"</p> <p>Those who uphold the existing order can never accept that ordinary citizens might be able or willing to challenge it, and so any manifestation of \"people power\" is always followed by a search for the hidden hand that has been pulling the strings. I was, therefore, unsurprised by my lunch companion's conspiracy theory; what surprises me is that it isn't more widely believed. How can there be genuine rejoicing in the streets of Belgrade? Haven't countless British politicians and pundits, from both left and right, assured us that President Milosevic enjoys near-universal support in his own country?</p> <p>In May last year, only a few days before the Serb withdrawal from Kosovo, Martin Bell MP told the House of Commons why the Nato intervention had nevertheless failed: \"My feeling is that, as far as his domestic political situation is concerned, Milosevic has been strengthened.\" In the House of Lords, former defence minister Lord Blaker warned that \"the determination of the Serb people to support Mr Milosevic would be increased\". The political journalist Paul Routledge wrote in the Mirror that \"the tyrant Milosevic is still in power, and more popular with his people than ever\", while Times readers learned from Simon Jenkins that \"Mr Milosevic may be 'degraded' but he is politically impregnable\". The Daily Mail agreed: \"There is no doubt the country is now united behind Milosevic.\"</p> <p>A Panorama programme on The Mind of Milosevic interviewed Dr Jerrold Post, who was director of the CIA's political psychology centre from 1989 to 1998. \"I believe,\" he intoned gravely, \"that the Nato strike designed to weaken him will strengthen him and will very much add not only to his support but to his mystique.\" Tony Benn, Henry Kissinger and a large battalion of historians and retired ambassadors claimed that Nato's onslaught had scuppered any chance of a more democratic regime emerging in Belgrade for many years to come. In the words of Denis Healey, \"All observers agree that the bombing has strengthened Milosevic's political position in Yugoslavia.\"</p> <p>Not all observers, actually. On this page last April, I quoted what George Orwell had written in 1940: \"Whereas socialism, and even capitalism in a more grudging way, have said to people, 'I offer you a good time,' Hitler has said to them, 'I offer you struggle, danger and death,' and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet. Perhaps later on they will get sick of it and change their minds, as at the end of the last war.\" And so they did; though Hitler's hegemony over his people seemed unchallengeable at the time, as soon as he and his gang were defeated the Germans exorcised the demon and democratised their nation. Was it vain to hope, I wondered, that history might repeat itself?</p> <p>Even during the Nato campaign, Milosevic was never as \"politically impregnable\" as the pundits claimed. At the end of April 1999, deputy prime minister Vuk Draskovic appeared on state television to denounce the president for dragging the nation into a war it couldn't win. Other opposition leaders started demanding Milosevic's resignation, and by early May there was evidence of widespread public discontent: our own Maggie O'Kane reported on it at length, which may be why she was promptly expelled from Belgrade.</p> <p>After the ceasefire of June 1999, it became clearer still that the population which had supposedly flung itself at Milosevic's feet was indeed \"sick of it\". More than 10,000 Serbs took to the streets of Cacak on June 29 to demand the immediate resignation of the dictator. In the southern city of Prokuplje, which had hitherto been regarded as a Milosevic stronghold, only five people turned up on July 8 for the first pro-government demonstration since the end of the Kosovo war - while 4,000 staged a rival rally in the main square, chanting \"Slobo like Saddam\" and \"Slobo out\". A month later, 150,000 anti-Milosevic protesters marched through the centre of Belgrade. The president's downfall had become a question of when, not if.</p> <p>Why, then, did so many allegedly perceptive observers maintain that he was invincibly popular? The answer, I'd guess, is that they took Milosevic at his own estimation. It's an all too common error: throughout the 1990s, he convinced foreign politicians and diplomats that he was the man who could deliver peace in the Balkans, rather than the father of strife. Hence the willingness of successive British foreign secretaries to peddle the fiction that the Bosnian conflict was a \"civil war\", even though they knew perfectly well that it had been instigated and directed from Belgrade.</p> <p>By treating the Butcher of the Balkans as a reasonable statesman who must be accommodated, those grandees who proclaimed their even-handedness - Douglas Hurd, Malcolm Rifkind, David Owen, Sir Michael Rose - proved in effect to be accomplices of Serb aggression, since the beneficiaries of this neutrality were Milosevic and his goon squads. Hurd accidentally gave the game away in April 1993, when explaining why the arms embargo against Bosnia shouldn't be lifted. Although \"at first sight it seems an act of justice\", he said, in practice it would merely create a \"level killing field\".</p> <p>The only possible inference to be drawn was that he preferred an uneven killing field, on which Milo-sevic provided the Bosnian Serbs with troops and weapons while the Bosnian government had to make do with whatever equipment it could buy on the black market or grab from captured enemy soldiers. Confirming this interpretation, Hurd said that allowing the Bosnians to defend themselves would \"only prolong the fighting\".</p> <p>Hurd's successor, Rifkind, continued the tradition of appeasement by default.

As late as January last year, Robin Cook told the House of Commons that although the massacre of Kosovar civilians in Racak was \"a war crime\", the blame \"lies with both sides\".</p> <p>Despite all the atrocities committed by Serb troops and paramilitaries, from Vukovar in 1991 via Srebrenica in 1995 right up to Racak in 1999, international negotiators insisted that Milosevic was \"a man we can do business with\", in the words of the US envoy Richard Holbrooke.

However, Goebbels structured all communications and cultural life through \"guilds\" which excluded Jews, communists and other undesirables, but which totally controlled work. Riefenstahl was, of course, a member. He then actively discouraged people like her from joining the party in order to fool the public about their independence. Contrary to Walker's claims, Riefenstahl's relationship with the Nazi leadership was deep and abiding and antedated their coming to power.

      "body": "<p>David Gray is wearing a sheepskin coat and standing in the velvety lobby of a plush Leeds hotel. He thinks the coat makes him look like a football commentator, and so he does an impersonation of how Robert de Niro might sound if he'd been inspired by Match of the Day's John Motson. Three lads exit the lift and do a double-take on their way to the bar. \"Eh! It's David Gray,\" they grin as they pass, providing an impression of their own: the refrain of his hit Babylon. \"Friday night I'm going nowhere,\" they sing. David Gray smiles at his feet. \"Life,\" he says, \"is getting weird.\" </p> <p>Like every other date on this British tour, Leeds University is sold out. Inside a young lawyer couple rub shoulders with a trio of early 20s clubbers. \"We love football, we love clubbing, we all love this music,\" says Dominic, 24. \"I love the way it crosses boundaries between folk and dance.\" Jonathon, a 31-year-old artist, tells me: \"There's an age group of 20s and 30s not being catered for.\" Two grey-haired men in fleeces tell me their only criticism would be, \"he should cheer up\". There are teenage girls in heels, even a couple of families - not to mention a gay couple who wrap their arms around each other during one special moment. </p> <p>The atmosphere surges with goodwill and emotion. People smile and tell me that Gray deserves his success; that his songs stand out from the manufactured music that dominates mainstream pop. As Babylon starts he twangs a folksy guitar over a finger-clicking background before the band break into a warm rush of chorus that has the crowd waving their hands in the air and singing along. His rich voice effortlessly fills the hall, and White Ladder's many high points, such as My Oh My, with its soulful crescendo of a chorus and the poignant piano ballad, This Year's Love, are greeted with open arms. The songwriting is passionate and timeless, yet White Ladder's gentle backings, flavoured by the electronic home studio it was recorded on, give it a swirling atmospheric intensity that acoustic guitar bands rarely achieve. </p> <p>More than half a million people in the UK have bought White Ladder since April and his new single Please Forgive Me looks set for top 10 success. When Burt Bacharach cancelled, Gray got to play the main stage at this year's Glastonbury Festival and hobnob with David Bowie. \"We captured something, a time and a place, that has appealed to people who've heard it,\" he says. This unassuming singer-songwriter from a nowhere town in South Wales seems to have struck a chord with his disarmingly honest love songs. </p> <p>Is it because the British love an underdog? Everyone at the gig seems to know the story: plucky singer-songwriter spends eight years battling at the bottom of the record industry pile, releasing three failed albums in a sequence of record company disasters, before putting out White Ladder on his own label, and seeing it romp to number one in Ireland. \"A year ago,\" he says, \"I was actually driving the van and playing in some shit-hole down the road to 150 people who weren't sure.\" Now, since his major label EastWest turned Irish success international, Gray guests on American TV with David Letterman and rides helicopters to Radio One roadshows. </p> <p>Now people are rushing out to get his three previous albums, along with a quietly released acoustic-based companion to White Ladder called Lost Songs. And Gray's fans are the kind of people who prefer to find their own way to a records like this, who nod in agreement when Gray talks about a \"sterile cultural vacuum\". </p> <p>\"We know far too much,\" says Gray. \"Everything's pumped far too much in the front of your mind; we're actually overloaded with information. Someone said, 'Try to go through a city without reading anything, and you realise just how many sentences are forced into your mind on a minute-by-minute basis.'\" </p> <p>Gray is that rare pop star: happily married for seven years, and to a solicitor to boot. He says that Olivia is his best friend and insists, \"I work hard at my marriage\". In his songs, as in his interviews, Gray wears his heart on his sleeve. \"Art is embarrassing and uncomfortable at times. But then that's the strength of it. Without the vulnerability there'd be nothing there. You have to stake something. It's not like I'm completely comfortable about it.

      "bodyText": "David Gray is wearing a sheepskin coat and standing in the velvety lobby of a plush Leeds hotel. He thinks the coat makes him look like a football commentator, and so he does an impersonation of how Robert de Niro might sound if he'd been inspired by Match of the Day's John Motson. Three lads exit the lift and do a double-take on their way to the bar. \"Eh! It's David Gray,\" they grin as they pass, providing an impression of their own: the refrain of his hit Babylon. \"Friday night I'm going nowhere,\" they sing. David Gray smiles at his feet. \"Life,\" he says, \"is getting weird.\" Like every other date on this British tour, Leeds University is sold out. Inside a young lawyer couple rub shoulders with a trio of early 20s clubbers. \"We love football, we love clubbing, we all love this music,\" says Dominic, 24. \"I love the way it crosses boundaries between folk and dance.\" Jonathon, a 31-year-old artist, tells me: \"There's an age group of 20s and 30s not being catered for.\" Two grey-haired men in fleeces tell me their only criticism would be, \"he should cheer up\". There are teenage girls in heels, even a couple of families - not to mention a gay couple who wrap their arms around each other during one special moment. The atmosphere surges with goodwill and emotion. People smile and tell me that Gray deserves his success; that his songs stand out from the manufactured music that dominates mainstream pop. As Babylon starts he twangs a folksy guitar over a finger-clicking background before the band break into a warm rush of chorus that has the crowd waving their hands in the air and singing along. His rich voice effortlessly fills the hall, and White Ladder's many high points, such as My Oh My, with its soulful crescendo of a chorus and the poignant piano ballad, This Year's Love, are greeted with open arms. The songwriting is passionate and timeless, yet White Ladder's gentle backings, flavoured by the electronic home studio it was recorded on, give it a swirling atmospheric intensity that acoustic guitar bands rarely achieve. More than half a million people in the UK have bought White Ladder since April and his new single Please Forgive Me looks set for top 10 success. When Burt Bacharach cancelled, Gray got to play the main stage at this year's Glastonbury Festival and hobnob with David Bowie. \"We captured something, a time and a place, that has appealed to people who've heard it,\" he says. This unassuming singer-songwriter from a nowhere town in South Wales seems to have struck a chord with his disarmingly honest love songs. Is it because the British love an underdog? Everyone at the gig seems to know the story: plucky singer-songwriter spends eight years battling at the bottom of the record industry pile, releasing three failed albums in a sequence of record company disasters, before putting out White Ladder on his own label, and seeing it romp to number one in Ireland. \"A year ago,\" he says, \"I was actually driving the van and playing in some shit-hole down the road to 150 people who weren't sure.\" Now, since his major label EastWest turned Irish success international, Gray guests on American TV with David Letterman and rides helicopters to Radio One roadshows. Now people are rushing out to get his three previous albums, along with a quietly released acoustic-based companion to White Ladder called Lost Songs. And Gray's fans are the kind of people who prefer to find their own way to a records like this, who nod in agreement when Gray talks about a \"sterile cultural vacuum\". \"We know far too much,\" says Gray. \"Everything's pumped far too much in the front of your mind; we're actually overloaded with information. Someone said, 'Try to go through a city without reading anything, and you realise just how many sentences are forced into your mind on a minute-by-minute basis.'\" Gray is that rare pop star: happily married for seven years, and to a solicitor to boot. He says that Olivia is his best friend and insists, \"I work hard at my marriage\". In his songs, as in his interviews, Gray wears his heart on his sleeve. \"Art is embarrassing and uncomfortable at times. But then that's the strength of it. Without the vulnerability there'd be nothing there. You have to stake something. It's not like I'm completely comfortable about it. I get put in the most ludicrous situations where I'm hanging on for dear life,\" he says, \"performing in the corridor of some radio station while a bunch of people in suits gawp at you.\" Faced with the obsessive publicity-guzzling of stars like the All Saints' Appleton sisters or Robbie Williams it's perhaps understandable that audiences find David Gray and his awkwardly open emotions rather refreshing. So they don't mistake his low-key honesty for blandness? \"Bland?\" he repeats, looking upset at the suggestion. \"I don't think it's bland.\" Born in Manchester in 1970, Gray grew up in rural South Wales, in the Pembrokeshire town of Solva after his parents dropped out of the family bakery business. They turned to crafts, and he spent his summers burning names onto personalised egg cups. \"You have to be very creative about entertaining yourself in such a monotonous place,\" he says. \"The culture is just dominated by drinking and people who don't have a take on culture.

      "body": "<p>In I Didn't Know You Cared, Peter Tinniswood's comic novel about an awful extended family called the Brandons, the absurdly pessimistic Uncle Mort goes to see a specialist. It is his 10th visit. He is given six months to live. \"Six months, eh?\" says Mr Brandon. \"Well, at least you'll get a few weeks in of the rugby season before you snuff it.\" </p> <p>It took only one visit to the dentist for Tinniswood to have his oral cancer diagnosed. That was five years ago - time enough for lots of rugby, and plenty of cricket, Tinniswood's greatest love, and the source for his gloriously dotty cricketing stories, Tales From the Long Room. Since then the cancer has spread and he has endured radiotherapy, the removal of most of his tongue and jugular vein, a laryngectomy and two haemorrhages of such severity that he almost died. </p> <p>But once a Liverpudlian joker, always a joker. \"I am now like something out of novel by Charles Dickens,\" says Tinniswood, 64, who communicates using an artificial voice box that emits a sound like a half-strangled Dalek. His partner and carer, the actress Lizzie Goulding, has become a full-time interpreter. \"When he lost his voice, I lost mine,\" she says quietly when we meet in the couple's Surrey cottage. </p> <p>Talking may have become a challenge, but writing has never been so good for Tinniswood, best known for a string of high-class radio plays and the TV sitcom I Didn't Know You Cared. He is a superbly gifted comic novelist, a true original. Yet, as with plenty of writers with a mortgage to pay and children to raise, he has spread himself too thin. His career has been a catalogue of TV pilots and sitcoms that never got made, star vehicles and spin-offs that spun on too long. </p> <p>With his remarkable facility for dialogue he should have been a natural for the theatre, but even that turned sour in 1972 when he wrote a play called The Investiture, which was slammed by Harold Hobson as the worst play he had seen. Tinniswood retreated, angry and hurt. </p> <p>\"I never turned anything down, that was my problem. I wrote so much crap,\" says Tinniswood cheerfully but not proudly. While he still hankered after doing theatre, and did a translation of Eduardo de Filippo's Napoli Milionaria for the National Theatre in 1991, it was radio that saved Tinniswood from becoming a hack. During the past three decades he has produced a steady stream of radio gems such as I Always Go for Long Walks, A Small Union, Two into Three and Ten Cows. Even Uncle Mort seemed happier on radio than on TV: Uncle Mort's North Country was a return to classic comic form. He talks of radio as a man talks of his lover: \"It is a one-to-one experience. You have direct access to the listener and you can go word daft, enjoy the frenzy of words. There is no medium in which you can be so daring.\" </p> <p>But now that Tinniswood has lost his speaking voice, he has found a new voice as a writer. His two short plays The Scan and the Voice Boxer, which open tonight at the Bristol Old Vic under the umbrella title of Croak, Croak, Croak, are a new departure for Tinniswood. These two absurdist comedies are tough and hard and seem born of such comic desperation that they put you in mind of the work of writers such as Vaclav Havel who used theatre as a way to communicate because the regimes under which they lived would not allow them to speak out. Illness can be a prison, but ironically for Tinniswood, despite all the physical pain and indignities, it has liberated his writing. </p> <p>\"I've no longer got the same capacity for writing. I can only do so much every day,\" he explains. \"And because I can't do so much, I do what I want to do. I'm exploring new worlds, using all the skills I've learned over a lifetime in a concentrated way. For the first time I'm confident as a writer.\" He now works for about three hours a day and spends the rest of the time reading the Folio Society editions that he has a compulsion to order. </p> <p>But it is this new lease of life as a writer that really engages him. The Scan, about a man who pops into a local hospital for a check-up, had its genesis in Tinniswood's having to undergo a body scan, an experience he found so terrifying that he began writing a play in his head. The Voice Boxer is a play about grief, loss and anger as a man wakes up after a laryngectomy and discovers that his voice has developed a life of its own and started to travel the world. </p> <p>But Tinniswood denies that these are purely autobiographical works. \"I am not a chronicler of my own illness in these plays. I'm an observer of someone else's illness. It is just that my experience gives me insight,\" he says. \"I don't analyse myself too closely. I'm too frightened of doing that, too frightened that it will all go. I want to write plays that make people think about their own condition, that alarm them, frighten them, make them laugh and entertain them. If there is one thing I can do, that is entertain people, and entertaining people is a very honourable thing to do. I am still tempted just to put in the jokes that come so easily. But now I've learned to cross them out, to find another way. I really do think that I am at last coming into my own.\" As he says it, the thin figure in the corner suddenly looks surprisingly young and robust. Some writers may indeed live to write, but in Tinniswood's case I suspect he is writing to live. </p> <p>Croak, Croak, Croak is at Bristol Old Vic from tonight. Box office: 0117 9877877.</p>",

Once the glacial beauty started to fade, it seems she felt positively liberated, and by the time her teeth tarnished, she was in clover. No more Dolce Vita myth to carry around, no more fatuous admirers to send away with a sneer. </p> <p>That, the theory goes, must be the psychology behind Radiohead's new record, Kid A. It is well known that the group were somewhat disturbed by the outlandish success of their OK Computer - Greatest or Second Greatest Album Ever, depending on the latest poll. It is always hard to top a show-stopping act, but Kid A appears to be more than a reaction to that: it has been widely interpreted as Radiohead's conscious attempt to alienate their fans. Look, it seems to say, hardly any guitars, not much singing, and yellow, unbrushed teeth - still fancy this? </p> <p>The range of critical reactions to Kid A has included mystification, withering contempt and the suggestion that the band will feel a lot better when this adolescent phase is out of their system. There has been some genuine excitement too, and rightly so. Kid A is a bold, seductive work that's worth devoting a little more time to - a rejection of stadium pop in favour of Pompidou Centre pop, with the workings on the outside and abstract sculpture courts in unexpected places. </p> <p>Why shouldn't they, after all, use their success and the recording budgets that come with it to give their audience a crack at something a little more risky? Is it such an insult to expose guitar fans to Mingus-style free-brass blowing? Up at EMI, they must be feeling as though the Beatles had put out Revolution 9 all over again. </p> <p>The reaction is quite gratifying in the current blandly tolerant music scene. Any artist who takes a deliberate left turn must, unconsciously at least, be wistful for the days when such tactics could elicit murderous rage in audiences. Once, Miles Davis and Bob Dylan were considered Judases for going electric; these days, they would simply put out an MTV-sponsored album called Plugged, and get patted on the head by Rolling Stone. But no two artists change their style for quite the same reason, and no two audiences react quite the same way. The classic example of an extreme detour is Metal Machine Music, Lou Reed's 1975 LP comprising four sides of electronic noise. Few people bought it at the time, but because of Reed's iconoclast status, it won him considerable kudos as a smart conceptualist. These days, it is widely regarded as some sort of classic, whether or not it's any more listenable. </p> <p>Do performers really hate their audiences enough to want to alienate them? It does occasionally happen that an act feels the need to shake off its audience, or part of it. Consider the plight of those immaculately liberal 2-Tone acts saddled with a racist skinhead contingent. Nirvana, it is said, struggled hard to lose the Guns N' Roses fans who loved their Nevermind album. And imagine our own Imagine Tricky when his Maxinquaye debut became a favoured dinner-table record: hence Pre-Millennium Tension, guaranteed to curdle anyone's profiteroles. </p> <p>What's usually at stake when an act changes tack is less audience-loathing than an honest desire to shake things up a bit. It is very rare that artists explictly rail at the audience that made them successful. What really suggests contempt for the audience is turning out more of the same, and that is what it would have been if Radiohead had meekly taken the money and turned out OK Computer 2. What would that have made them - Mike Oldfield? Supertramp? Oasis? On Kid A, they risk their reputation and possibly a wodge of their revenue, and good for them. Nothing is less use than a bored artist, and if the result turns out like, say, John Cleese ditching the comedy and taking up psychotherapy instead, then too bad - you still have Fawlty Towers on tape, don't you?</p>",

Yes, the latest sitcom mastermind is none other than Gene Simmons, bass player and \"The Demon\" in KISS. Gene could be sitting back enjoying the big bucks from the latest reunion tours, and pondering the curious fact that his band are now more credible than they ever have been in their long history. After all, the rock revival which is sweeping through Britain seemed to start when every fashionable girl in London was seen sporting tiny (ironic or sincere? Or both?) KISS T-shirts. But Simmons, who has slipped in being a teacher, an actor and a manager along with becoming a rock god and sleeping with 4,000 women, is clearly a man who cannot rest. So he has found the time to oversee a new half-hour comedy, one surprisingly set in the always squalid, back-stabbing and generally lowdown world of the music industry. </p> <p>Smash, which will run on the US version of VH-1, is about a pop rapper - MC Hammer somehow seems to spring naturally to mind - whose moment of fame has slipped by, and who is now trying to hustle his way up the ladder again as a manager. Which is something Simmons knows about, because in one of the many weird turns his career has taken, he juggled being in America's most successful rock band with managing Liza Minelli. </p> <p>In fact, Simmons' biography is packed with the unlikely. The man who became a hero to mildly rebellious mid-westerners was born Chaim Witz in Haifa, 1949, son of a Holocaust survivor. After his parents split in 1954, his mother took him to New York, where Chaim became Eugene Klein. He says he learnt English from watching Disney cartoons. The myth has it that young Eugene considered becoming a rabbi before the urge to rock'n'roll all night overcame him, but he actually qualified as a teacher and worked at Vogue before he and Paul Stanley cobbled together their overwrought fusion of Alice Cooper and British glam rock and a legend was born. The music definitely took third place to the image and the lifestyle. </p> <p>Few people have made as much of an effort at being a true rock star as Simmons, especially when it came to the ladies. Simmons estimates that he has slept with at least 3,000 women, and probably more like 4,000 (if he started out when he was 4 or so, that works out at around 108 a year). Among his more notable partners are Cher, Diana Ross and soft porn stalwart Shannon Tweed, with whom he has two children. Way back in 1978 he stole the show in KISS Meets The Phantom Of The Park. His fledging acting career peaked in 1987 when he played Malak Al Rahaim, a ruthless Arab (no comment) terrorist in the deranged B-movie Wanted: Dead Or Alive. </p> <p>The film ends when bounty hunter Rutger Hauer finally tracks Simmons down, and sticks a grenade in his mouth. All he has to do to collect the money is hand Simmons over. Instead he pulls the pin, and the murdering Muslim has his head blown apart. Possibly fearing he could never match that moment, Simmons has only made a couple of acting appearances since. Instead, he turned to producing, starting on familiar ground with last year's film Detroit Rock City, a comedy about kids in the 70s trying to get to a KISS gig. </p> <p>And while the sitcom could be interesting, it's the next Simmons project that could be the real winner: The Neil Bogart Story. Bogart (born Bogatz) was the boss of Casablanca records, home to KISS, the Village People and Donna Summer in the 1970s. Casablanca were the very embodiment of 70s insanity. Cocaine on demand? You got it. A Benz for every last schmuck in the promotions department? Executives attacking each other with golf clubs? A lobby based on the oasis theme, complete with a genuine camel? Yes, yes and yes. And not content with running the most flamboyant record company around, Bogart talked PolyGram into letting him set up a film division, which came up with a predictable disco turkey Thank God It's Friday, but also funded Midnight Express (no surprise there either, actually). Bogart died of cancer in 1982, two years after Polygram had eased him out of his own company. But it is one hell of a story, and if there is one man who can make sure that the whole messy saga gets told with every last excessive minute included, it has to be Gene Simmons. We're waiting.</p>",

After his parents split in 1954, his mother took him to New York, where Chaim became Eugene Klein. He says he learnt English from watching Disney cartoons. The myth has it that young Eugene considered becoming a rabbi before the urge to rock'n'roll all night overcame him, but he actually qualified as a teacher and worked at Vogue before he and Paul Stanley cobbled together their overwrought fusion of Alice Cooper and British glam rock and a legend was born. The music definitely took third place to the image and the lifestyle. Few people have made as much of an effort at being a true rock star as Simmons, especially when it came to the ladies. Simmons estimates that he has slept with at least 3,000 women, and probably more like 4,000 (if he started out when he was 4 or so, that works out at around 108 a year). Among his more notable partners are Cher, Diana Ross and soft porn stalwart Shannon Tweed, with whom he has two children. Way back in 1978 he stole the show in KISS Meets The Phantom Of The Park. His fledging acting career peaked in 1987 when he played Malak Al Rahaim, a ruthless Arab (no comment) terrorist in the deranged B-movie Wanted: Dead Or Alive. The film ends when bounty hunter Rutger Hauer finally tracks Simmons down, and sticks a grenade in his mouth. All he has to do to collect the money is hand Simmons over. Instead he pulls the pin, and the murdering Muslim has his head blown apart. Possibly fearing he could never match that moment, Simmons has only made a couple of acting appearances since. Instead, he turned to producing, starting on familiar ground with last year's film Detroit Rock City, a comedy about kids in the 70s trying to get to a KISS gig. And while the sitcom could be interesting, it's the next Simmons project that could be the real winner: The Neil Bogart Story. Bogart (born Bogatz) was the boss of Casablanca records, home to KISS, the Village People and Donna Summer in the 1970s. Casablanca were the very embodiment of 70s insanity. Cocaine on demand? You got it. A Benz for every last schmuck in the promotions department? Executives attacking each other with golf clubs? A lobby based on the oasis theme, complete with a genuine camel? Yes, yes and yes. And not content with running the most flamboyant record company around, Bogart talked PolyGram into letting him set up a film division, which came up with a predictable disco turkey Thank God It's Friday, but also funded Midnight Express (no surprise there either, actually). Bogart died of cancer in 1982, two years after Polygram had eased him out of his own company. But it is one hell of a story, and if there is one man who can make sure that the whole messy saga gets told with every last excessive minute included, it has to be Gene Simmons. We're waiting.",

He went on to be responsible for some of the most striking Coliseum sets of the 1980s and 1990s, including the Xerxes, directed by Nicholas Hytner, that effectively kick-started the Handel revival in this country, and the two searing Verdi productions by David Alden, Simon Boccanegra and A Masked Ball. </p> <p>It was as a result of those shows that he and Alden were asked to work on the Pet Shop Boys' world tour in 1991, and Fielding went on to work on a series of videos with the band as well.

But since Fielding and Tom Cairns took the plunge in British opera, others have followed. Anthony Macdonald is directing shows now, and so is Nigel Lowery, and Fielding thinks that there is less resistance from managements to the idea of designers taking charge, and even for them to work in other people's designs. \"I've been trying to delegate this process and collaborate for some time,\" he says. \"But with the less well-financed organisations like Garsington [where Fielding has been directing a Strauss series, with Intermezzo to come next summer] they feel they are getting a good deal by getting me to do both.\" </p> <p>His work now straddles opera and theatre; he has just staged Back to Methusalah for the Other Place in Stratford, part of a short season for which he designed the whole environment (rather like the ENO's project), and directed the final play, the Shaw, himself, There are major design projects to come too - a Ring cycle for Tokyo to be directed by Keith Warner, and a musical, The 5,000 Fingers of Dr T, based on a Dr Seuss film . It will open next year in Dallas. </p> <p>Fielding was recruited to the Italian season at quite a late stage in the project's development when many of the major decisions about the series had been taken. He admits that the experience has not been totally without \"inner conflicts\". </p> <p>Inheriting the environment that Lazaridis had invented was a challenge: \"I was very aware as I watched what Stefan had done with all the different shows that we needed to do something unlike what had gone before. I hope we are presenting another take on the idea.\" </p> <p>He is full of admiration for Rossini's score: \"Unlike The Barber of Seville, which has a steely, cold quality about it, this has warmth; it is very human and allows you to laugh with the characters.\" But the problem with The Turk in Italy, he thinks, is that the plot is so complicated; his idea was to develop the storyline and to apply a new structure to it. That has involved rewriting a certain amount of the text, which is being sung in Kit Hesketh-Harvey's translation. Nonetheless Fielding finds the libretto intriguing, likening it to an early version of Pirandello, with a central character, a poet in the original, who invents the scenes that are acted out around him. </p> <p>In Fielding's staging the poet is transformed into a film director, with the Italian New Wave cinema of the 1960s, and Fellini's masterpiece 8 1/2 in particular, as the starting point. The production uses film as a medium for expressing the inconsistencies of time and space that are endemic to the opera. Rossini needs that kind of thoughtful advocacy; with the obvious exceptions of The Barber and Cinderella, too few of his operas have won a place in the central repertory, and the Italian season would have been much poorer without one representative of that huge, and important body of work.</p> <p>The Turk in Italy is at the London Coliseum, WC2 (020-7632 8300), from tonight till November 18.</p>",

Otherwise, people may think you were quite mad yourself and that would never do.

Whoever she is, Trevor said she sent him messages through the records she played and he received further messages through numberplates he saw and through the overheard conversations of strangers. The means by which he received such love notes was \"innuendously\", he explained. Trevor believes he communicates with his loved one telepathically and thinks everyone in the country knows about their relationship. He was so concrete in his conviction, nothing could sway him from its reality. Trevor suffers from de Clerambault's syndrome or erotomania, a condition whereby a sufferer delusionally fixates their love on a completely unwitting individual whom they have never or rarely met, someone who most definitely isn't in love with them. </p> <p>As the sultry Siobhan Redmond breathed brittlely in her voiceover, being in love is the closest most of us get to madness. As such, Trevor's condition was all the more scary. Like the most frightening of Them, he was almost one of Us. After all, who hasn't been truly, madly, deeply in love? Apart from Ian Paisley or the Pope or someone, obviously. </p> <p>Being in love is both blissful and tortuous, yearning and fulfilment simultaneously. You do lose your mind, abandon your senses and discard logic, rhyme and reason as minor details. When you're in love, you think the laws of physics, the conventions of society and the tenets of rational thought don't apply to you. You are invincible to everything but your perception of your beloved's wishes, which govern you like a rod of iron. It's a common enough feeling, and those who haven't experienced it are arguably the abnormal, the \"mad\" among us. There surely is no shame in it, is there? </p> <p>Yet while most of us get over this infatuation and either a) settle down with the object of one's affection in a life of domestic bliss punctuated by bickering and boredom, or b) suddenly lose interest in the heretofore love of one's life and move onto another, erotomaniacs do neither, and remain trapped in a distorted, delusional world. While erotomania may be frightening for us, it is a blight on the lives of those who suffer from it and those whom they target with enduring love.

      "byline": "Christopher Hope",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the old South Africa, censorship was not just a necessity, it was an industry. Poems were suspect, pictures dangerous. The liberal press was said to be unjust, unfair and unpatriotic and deserved to be closed down. The censors were busy people. They banned everything from lapel badges to T-shirts.</p> <p>I had my first brush with the censors in 1972, when a satirical ditty of mine called Kobus Le Grange Marais was banned by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). It contained \"words and phrases likely to cause offence\" (in this case to Afrikaners), and it was said to be \"racist\". The SABC of the time was so slavishly supportive of the ruling party it was known as the government's glove-puppet.</p> <p>The regime was brutal, but strangely sensitive. If its people called you a liberal subversive in the pay of effete capitalist western powers - and this was a common charge - it was regarded as fair comment. But if you suggested that South Africa was run by a bunch of racist desperadoes whose barbarism was exceeded only by their stupidity, that was unfair, un-South African, and swiftly suppressed.</p> <p>A few years later, in 1976, my novel, A Separate Development, was banned for \"holding up sections of the population to scorn and derision\" (this time it was the police). Our censors were grimly amusing in their obsessions. A title was enough to cause trouble. Martin Buber's theological treatise, Between Man and Man, was banned because rumour said it might be a gay treatise. Of course, people laughed and so it became an offence to mock the censors' decisions. In effect they tried to ban laughter.</p> <p>All that was supposed to end with the new democratic government of 1994. It didn't. A couple of years after the new South Africa was born, Kobus Le Grange Marais was dusted off after 25 years of silence, set to music and sent off to be broadcast. The new \"transformed\" SABC promptly banned it again, for reasons not far removed from those given the last time around. It contained words and phrases likely to cause offence - this time to blacks. In a word, it was \"racist\".</p> <p>How did it feel, someone asked, to have my work banned in the old and the new South Africa? Quite nostalgic, actually.</p> <p>It goes on - this urge to shut people up. Anyone visiting South Africa and looking at the papers or the TV will catch, before long, a whiff of paranoia in the air. The search is on for enemies of the people, the unpatriotic, the dissident, the disloyal. The fortunes of the country are once again being equated with those of the ruling party. The line between party and state was washed away under the old apartheid regime and has not been redrawn. Increasingly the search is on for dissenters. The charges are the same - unpatriotic, unfair, un-South African.</p> <p>Only the methods have changed. In the old days, when people like BJ Vorster led the apartheid government, and someone at a political meeting asked a question the prime minister did not like, he would send in the security police the next morning.</p> <p>In the new South Africa, they send in the committees. Earlier this year I watched a committee sniffing out something called \"subliminal\" racism in the press. Difficult thing to defend yourself against - the subliminal. You may have it even if you don't know it. \"Racism\" is a word used to brand your political enemies - as ubiquitous and as empty a label as \"communism\" once was. It even comes colour-coded. \"Racist\" may be coupled with or swapped for the word \"white\", rather as \"communist\" and \"red\" used to be.</p> <p>Here and there the alarm is being raised. In his recent Steve Biko memorial lecture, the writer Njabulo Ndebele quietly and profoundly doubted the wisdom of this new name-calling. By constantly erecting this bogeyman of white racism, black South Africans were embracing again their old dependency, by ascribing to their former masters a power which they no longer possessed. There still existed an alarming \"heart of whiteness\", that whites themselves needed to confront and explore. But secret cabals of white racists bent on destroying the new democracy did not exist.</p> <p>Ndebele is chancellor of the University of Cape Town and one of the most original thinkers South Africa has produced. But what he said was heresy. The SABC refused to carry Ndebele's address and said by way of explanation that \"it was not in the national interest\" - a phrase so full of the perfume of the past that nostalgia again overwhelms me.</p> <p>Under the old regime at least you knew who the enemy was. Nowadays, you may be silenced by erstwhile allies. Or be expected to censor yourself. This is hotly denied, of course. You are free to say or write what you like in the new South Africa, say the authorities and their lackeys. But it's tosh. The ANC is the Party is the Government is the Country - that is the way it goes. And in its intolerance of criticism and debate the government and its minions do indeed pay unexpected homage to those they have replaced.</p> <p>This is not to say that racism is not alive and well and living comfortably in white South Africa. It would be amazing if this weren't so. For most of the last century entire rugby fields were packed with large chaps in shorts who not only believed in apartheid; if they had any regrets it was that there wasn't more of it. But these days a kind of general amnesia has set in, and it is almost impossible to meet anyone who believed in apartheid.</p> <p>Black South Africans who suffered the long lunacy find it infuriating. Of course they do. The same bums in the same pound seats. The odd thing is that it isn't the big chaps in shorts, beer-in-place-of-brains- brigade who are under fire. What is under attack is dissidence and independence. In a word, \"liberals\" are loathed every bit as much as they were under apartheid.</p> <p>The trouble with loathing is that once you get a taste for it you can't stop. You start finding enemies on your left and your right. In the woodwork, under the beds. And you have to gag them, too. It was with a pang of recognition that I read the protest of Oupa Moatshe, a trade-union organiser, who told the Sowetan newspaper that the SABC was not a public service - it was, he said sadly, (how the music comes back!) the \"state broadcaster\".</p> <p>Of course it is. The only thing that has changed on state-run television and radio under this new government is that this time round the puppet doesn't bother wearing a glove.</p> <p>Anyone who spends time in South Africa will be surprised by the intensity of the racial debate, and the heat of the political invective. The ANC government, elected with an overwhelming majority, shows itself to be as thin-skinned as the old Afrikaner establishment. Their languages mirror each other. Particularly, the language of threat.</p> <p>In the old days if you declined to accept that the white regime was fair, upright and democratic, you were a detestable liberal revolutionary and urged to go and live in Ghana. Today, those who doubt that the ANC government is divinely inspired are detestable liberal counter-revolutionaries, who should immediately start packing for Perth.</p> <p>There is also a deeply unhealthy respect for authority. One hears it in the way people talk about the administration. It proposes and disposes, it does not take the definite article, it is, quite simply \"Government\" - like \"God\". In reality, \"Government\" is simply that bit of the ruling party susceptible to manual stimulation - a kind of political G-spot. To watch ostensibly independent public servants, broadcasters , frightened liberals and pliant functionaries stroking the party's G-spot is to see a form of political pandering so perverse it should be viewed only by consenting bureaucrats.</p> <p>In South Africa now the need to manipulate information for \"patriotic\", that is to say, for political ends, is growing. The crime rate frightens many people, but crime may be a coded reference to race, so you stop releasing the figures. Murders get a lot of bad press, so you don't publish the numbers. Rape is widespread. Well then, let us declare it unpatriotic to talk about it. Road fatalities are shockingly high - let us no longer give them out.</p> <p>This being South Africa, such innovations are followed by a chorus of approval from party supporters. That is another old tradition, known as \"thanking the minister\". It has little to do with gratitude. It is a veiled warning to those who do not feel the required degree of appreciation.</p> <p>Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the current debate over Aids. President Thabo Mbeki questions whether Aids is a disease when it is \"a syndrome\". Confusion reigns. Aids may or may not be not a virus; it may or may not be spread by sexual contact. Party supporters are expected to believe several impossible things before breakfast. For example, that drugs for treating Aids are a conspiracy by US drug companies to increase profits. When the trades unions come out squarely and say that Aids is caused by HIV, the president suggests big American drug companies have infiltrated the unions. The party stalwarts toe the presidential line, thank him for his leadership, and shout down those who disagree. The minister of health refuses to answer questions on the causes of Aids. Only the virus is happy, to paraphrase WH Auden, and impervious to argument, strikes down more South Africans than ever.</p> <p>South Africa seems a country run on edicts, pronouncements, threats, hot air and the increasing need to find someone to blame. There has never been a tradition of free speech in South Africa. Words are weapons, their meanings found in the government gazette, not in the dictionary. The wrong form of words can seriously damage your health.</p> <p>Take a word like \"tolerance\". Tricky stuff, tolerance.

      "bodyText": "In the old South Africa, censorship was not just a necessity, it was an industry. Poems were suspect, pictures dangerous. The liberal press was said to be unjust, unfair and unpatriotic and deserved to be closed down. The censors were busy people. They banned everything from lapel badges to T-shirts. I had my first brush with the censors in 1972, when a satirical ditty of mine called Kobus Le Grange Marais was banned by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). It contained \"words and phrases likely to cause offence\" (in this case to Afrikaners), and it was said to be \"racist\". The SABC of the time was so slavishly supportive of the ruling party it was known as the government's glove-puppet. The regime was brutal, but strangely sensitive. If its people called you a liberal subversive in the pay of effete capitalist western powers - and this was a common charge - it was regarded as fair comment. But if you suggested that South Africa was run by a bunch of racist desperadoes whose barbarism was exceeded only by their stupidity, that was unfair, un-South African, and swiftly suppressed. A few years later, in 1976, my novel, A Separate Development, was banned for \"holding up sections of the population to scorn and derision\" (this time it was the police). Our censors were grimly amusing in their obsessions. A title was enough to cause trouble. Martin Buber's theological treatise, Between Man and Man, was banned because rumour said it might be a gay treatise. Of course, people laughed and so it became an offence to mock the censors' decisions. In effect they tried to ban laughter. All that was supposed to end with the new democratic government of 1994. It didn't. A couple of years after the new South Africa was born, Kobus Le Grange Marais was dusted off after 25 years of silence, set to music and sent off to be broadcast. The new \"transformed\" SABC promptly banned it again, for reasons not far removed from those given the last time around. It contained words and phrases likely to cause offence - this time to blacks. In a word, it was \"racist\". How did it feel, someone asked, to have my work banned in the old and the new South Africa? Quite nostalgic, actually. It goes on - this urge to shut people up. Anyone visiting South Africa and looking at the papers or the TV will catch, before long, a whiff of paranoia in the air. The search is on for enemies of the people, the unpatriotic, the dissident, the disloyal. The fortunes of the country are once again being equated with those of the ruling party. The line between party and state was washed away under the old apartheid regime and has not been redrawn. Increasingly the search is on for dissenters. The charges are the same - unpatriotic, unfair, un-South African. Only the methods have changed. In the old days, when people like BJ Vorster led the apartheid government, and someone at a political meeting asked a question the prime minister did not like, he would send in the security police the next morning. In the new South Africa, they send in the committees. Earlier this year I watched a committee sniffing out something called \"subliminal\" racism in the press. Difficult thing to defend yourself against - the subliminal. You may have it even if you don't know it. \"Racism\" is a word used to brand your political enemies - as ubiquitous and as empty a label as \"communism\" once was. It even comes colour-coded. \"Racist\" may be coupled with or swapped for the word \"white\", rather as \"communist\" and \"red\" used to be. Here and there the alarm is being raised. In his recent Steve Biko memorial lecture, the writer Njabulo Ndebele quietly and profoundly doubted the wisdom of this new name-calling. By constantly erecting this bogeyman of white racism, black South Africans were embracing again their old dependency, by ascribing to their former masters a power which they no longer possessed. There still existed an alarming \"heart of whiteness\", that whites themselves needed to confront and explore. But secret cabals of white racists bent on destroying the new democracy did not exist. Ndebele is chancellor of the University of Cape Town and one of the most original thinkers South Africa has produced. But what he said was heresy. The SABC refused to carry Ndebele's address and said by way of explanation that \"it was not in the national interest\" - a phrase so full of the perfume of the past that nostalgia again overwhelms me. Under the old regime at least you knew who the enemy was. Nowadays, you may be silenced by erstwhile allies. Or be expected to censor yourself. This is hotly denied, of course. You are free to say or write what you like in the new South Africa, say the authorities and their lackeys. But it's tosh. The ANC is the Party is the Government is the Country - that is the way it goes. And in its intolerance of criticism and debate the government and its minions do indeed pay unexpected homage to those they have replaced. This is not to say that racism is not alive and well and living comfortably in white South Africa. It would be amazing if this weren't so. For most of the last century entire rugby fields were packed with large chaps in shorts who not only believed in apartheid; if they had any regrets it was that there wasn't more of it. But these days a kind of general amnesia has set in, and it is almost impossible to meet anyone who believed in apartheid. Black South Africans who suffered the long lunacy find it infuriating. Of course they do. The same bums in the same pound seats. The odd thing is that it isn't the big chaps in shorts, beer-in-place-of-brains- brigade who are under fire. What is under attack is dissidence and independence. In a word, \"liberals\" are loathed every bit as much as they were under apartheid. The trouble with loathing is that once you get a taste for it you can't stop. You start finding enemies on your left and your right. In the woodwork, under the beds. And you have to gag them, too. It was with a pang of recognition that I read the protest of Oupa Moatshe, a trade-union organiser, who told the Sowetan newspaper that the SABC was not a public service - it was, he said sadly, (how the music comes back!) the \"state broadcaster\". Of course it is. The only thing that has changed on state-run television and radio under this new government is that this time round the puppet doesn't bother wearing a glove. Anyone who spends time in South Africa will be surprised by the intensity of the racial debate, and the heat of the political invective. The ANC government, elected with an overwhelming majority, shows itself to be as thin-skinned as the old Afrikaner establishment. Their languages mirror each other. Particularly, the language of threat. In the old days if you declined to accept that the white regime was fair, upright and democratic, you were a detestable liberal revolutionary and urged to go and live in Ghana. Today, those who doubt that the ANC government is divinely inspired are detestable liberal counter-revolutionaries, who should immediately start packing for Perth. There is also a deeply unhealthy respect for authority. One hears it in the way people talk about the administration. It proposes and disposes, it does not take the definite article, it is, quite simply \"Government\" - like \"God\". In reality, \"Government\" is simply that bit of the ruling party susceptible to manual stimulation - a kind of political G-spot. To watch ostensibly independent public servants, broadcasters , frightened liberals and pliant functionaries stroking the party's G-spot is to see a form of political pandering so perverse it should be viewed only by consenting bureaucrats. In South Africa now the need to manipulate information for \"patriotic\", that is to say, for political ends, is growing. The crime rate frightens many people, but crime may be a coded reference to race, so you stop releasing the figures. Murders get a lot of bad press, so you don't publish the numbers. Rape is widespread. Well then, let us declare it unpatriotic to talk about it. Road fatalities are shockingly high - let us no longer give them out. This being South Africa, such innovations are followed by a chorus of approval from party supporters. That is another old tradition, known as \"thanking the minister\". It has little to do with gratitude. It is a veiled warning to those who do not feel the required degree of appreciation. Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the current debate over Aids. President Thabo Mbeki questions whether Aids is a disease when it is \"a syndrome\". Confusion reigns. Aids may or may not be not a virus; it may or may not be spread by sexual contact. Party supporters are expected to believe several impossible things before breakfast. For example, that drugs for treating Aids are a conspiracy by US drug companies to increase profits. When the trades unions come out squarely and say that Aids is caused by HIV, the president suggests big American drug companies have infiltrated the unions. The party stalwarts toe the presidential line, thank him for his leadership, and shout down those who disagree. The minister of health refuses to answer questions on the causes of Aids. Only the virus is happy, to paraphrase WH Auden, and impervious to argument, strikes down more South Africans than ever. South Africa seems a country run on edicts, pronouncements, threats, hot air and the increasing need to find someone to blame. There has never been a tradition of free speech in South Africa. Words are weapons, their meanings found in the government gazette, not in the dictionary. The wrong form of words can seriously damage your health. Take a word like \"tolerance\". Tricky stuff, tolerance. Mzwandile Khumalo is the project officer for transformation and employment equity on the campus of the University of the Witwatersrand. This is my old college, where for decades under apartheid a celebrated anti-authoritarian spirit characterised staff and students. Not any more.

      "bodyText": "The European commission is today expected to take Britain to court for failing to relinquish its controversial \"golden share\" in BAA, the airports operator privatised in 1987. The move will anger the government since it has already indicated that it is willing to surrender the \u00a31 special rights preference share it retains in around a dozen formerly state-owned companies. Its failure to specify a timeframe for when it might shed these symbolic shares has forced the EC's hand, however, and Brussels now believes legal action will oblige the government to fulfill its promise in the case of BAA. The EC thinks the shares - which allow the government to protect companies from hostile takeovers and to veto key decisions in the name of the national interest - fly in the face of EU rules on the free movement of capital. The government's stake in BAA - which runs London's three main airports - prevents anyone from holding more than 15% of the company's equity. The idea is to ensure that Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports cannot be sold off without specific government approval. But if the European court of justice finds in the EC's favour the government could be fined, and would be forced to scrap its \"golden share\" in the airports authority, paving the way for a potential takeover. It has been argued that its stake in BAA does not impede the free movement of capital, since many non-British investors own stocks in the company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange. However, in July, senior government sources admitted there was no real reason for the government to hang on to its golden shares. But nothing has happened since then. The EC has taken a hard line on \"golden shares\" in other European countries, and has already sued Belgium, France, Spain and Portugal over the issue. It is also considering legal action against Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany.

      "bodyText": "OM of Sweden came under further pressure to increase its bid for the London Stock Exchange yesterday as a further fall in its shares reduced the value of its bid for the exchange by more than \u00a3100m. The fall in the Swedish group's shares came after the release of its profits figures for the first nine months of the year which were lower than many analysts had been forecast. Because the hostile bid by OM comprises largely of its own shares, the fall in its shares had the effect of cutting the value of its bid for the LSE to below \u00a3700m, compared with \u00a3808m on the day it made its surprise bid last month. This is less than the \u00a3840m at which the LSE's own shareholders value their business. OM has hinted that it is prepared to raise its offer but yesterday refused to say when or by how much the bid could be increased. Some industry sources are sceptical that the Swedish company will be able to raise its bid by much because of its offer is so dependent on its own share price being strong. An OM spokesman insisted yesterday that its share price fall was not connected to its profits figures but was part of the wider malaise hitting demand of hi-tech stocks listed on New York's Nasdaq market. \"Our shares have been tracking Nasdaq. We are seeing a bear market in hi-tech stocks,\" the spokesman said. One of the lines of defence mounted by the London Stock Exchange is that its shareholders should consider the risks involved in swapping their shares for one in a hi-tech company. The LSE's shares, which are not traded on the stock exchange but via the broking firm Cazenove, closed yesterday at \u00a328.20, lower than the levels above \u00a330 to which they jumped when OM made its offer but still higher than the current OM bid of \u00a325 per LSE share. The audacious bid by OM, which has forced the exchange to call off its planned merger with its German rival, has prompted reports in the Swedish media of allegations against Olof Stenhammar, the founder of OM, about irregularies in the campaign he led for Sweden to host the Olympic games in 2004. A spokeswoman for OM last night said that Mr Stenhammar \"denies any wrongdoing\". Per Larsson, the chief executive of OM, which owns the Swedish stock exchange, said the group was reporting \"another set of record results with increased income, profits and earnings per share\". Its profits for the nine months were 154m Swedish kronor (\u00a310m), below the market's expectations, hurt in part by its investment in Jiway, an online broking service in which it owns a 60% stake. Jiway, of which investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter owns 40%, is due to go live later next month and break even two years later. Shareholders in the LSE will vote next week on whether to lift the 4.9% single ownership limit on their shares which appears to prevent a takeover. OM said: \"We will continue talking to the owners of the LSE. It is a process of talking to them and then being able to acquire their shares.\" So far, just 1% of the LSE's shareholders have supported the OM bid. But, the takeover battle is only half way through and speculation continues to swirl that other exchange may yet put in rival bids for the LSE.",

      "body": "<p>\"What does she know of politics?\" scornfully asked a cousin of the assassinated prime minister of Ceylon, Solomon \"Solla\" Bandaranaike, when his widow Sirima announced that she was taking over his party's leadership in 1960.</p> <p>\"In Solla's time, Sirima presided over nothing fiercer than the kitchen fire,\" continued Paul Pieris Deriyanagala, who had been best man at the Bandaranaikes' wedding. \"She'll end by spoiling her personal reputation and ruining the family name.\"</p> <p>Few forecasts have proved so mistaken. Thanks to Sirima Bandaranaike, who has died of a heart attack aged 84, even more than to her husband, the name of Bandaranaike became a legend. She not only became the world's first woman prime minister, but went on to head her country's government three times. She altered the face of Ceylon, in many ways controversially, made it a republic, and changed its name to Sri Lanka.</p> <p>More than that, Mrs Bandaranaike became one of the third world's best-known leaders, rubbing shoulders with Indira Gandhi, Chou en-Lai, Marshal Tito and others in the heyday of the non-aligned movement. A cauldron far, indeed, from the kitchen fire, and, at home at least, much fiercer.</p> <p>Yasmine Gooneratne, another cousin within the vast Bandaranaike clan, who recounted \"Uncle Paulie's\" scathing comments in her family memoirs, Relative Merits, describes \"Aunt Sirima\" as \"the most formidable and charismatic leader the country has ever seen\". And in the words of Maureen Seneviratne, her biographer: \"If Mr Bandaranaike's stature as a politician and leader was built up over decades of campaigning, Sirimavo (the suffix \"vo\" denotes respect) donned hers like a cloak that had been lying in her wardrobe for years, unworn, but which had been pressed and kept ready for wearing at any given moment.\"</p> <p>Sirima Bandaranaike was born Sirima Ratwatte, the daughter of a prominent Sinhalese family in the Kandyan hill country of Ceylon - a perfect match for the wealthy, low-country family of her future husband, with his driving political ambition. Like many similar families, the Bandaranaikes were thoroughly anglicised, and held prominent positions in the British colonial regime then in charge of the country.</p> <p>Although many leading Kandyan families also served the government and adopted English first names, most remained staunchly Buddhist, and preserved Sinhalese traditions. Sirima's was just such a clan. Her father, Barnes Ratwatte (named, like her husband-to-be, after a British governor-general), was seen as an excellent match for her mother, herself the daughter of one of the best-known Kandyan chieftain families.</p> <p>Wanting the best education - which had to be English - for Sirima, the eldest of six children, her parents sent her, at the age of eight, to a convent boarding school in the capital, Colombo. But they ensured that she remained a devout Buddhist, speaking Sinhala as fluently as English. After leaving school, she threw herself into social welfare work, walking miles through jungles and over mountains to distribute food and medicines, organise clinics and develop village industries. She became a great favourite of the Sinhalese peasantry, acquiring a reputation that was to prove invaluable to both her husband and herself.</p> <p>Her marriage, in 1940, to Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike, then a brilliant, young, Oxford- educated colonial government minister, was dubbed \"the wedding of the century\". Both were from the top goyigama caste of landowners, and their horoscopes were found to match perfectly. And if he did not know the rural Sinhalese as she did, Bandaranaike instinctively sensed their needs and aspirations.</p> <p>Unfortunately, neither knew anything about the country's Tamil minority, its language and culture or needs and aspirations. It was an omission that often led the couple to ignore the Tamils, or make fatal blunders in dealing with them.</p> <p>At first, Sirima's public role was that of a dutiful wife. Her eldest child, Sunethra, was born in 1943, followed by Chandrika, and finally a boy, Anura. But in 1948, as the island of Ceylon edged towards independence, the shy, methodical wife and mother found her home invaded at all hours by her mercurial husband's friends, forever discussing politics and demanding refreshment.</p> <p>Throughout their married life, according to James Manor's biography of Bandaranaike, The Expedient Utopian, her main difficulty was her husband's male chauvinism. Manor cites a possibly apocryphal, but indicative, story about a delay in tea being served at a political gathering in their Colombo house, to the host's irritation. When it appeared at last, and his wife retired to the kitchen, he shouted: \"Sirima! These gentlemen drink tea with sugar. For the sugar to get into the cup, there must be some instrument. You have not put a spoon in the sugar bowl.\"</p> <p>Manor's account continues: \"The dutiful wife went to fetch a spoon, and Mr Bandaranaike quipped: 'We have to think for them too.'\" She made no complaint. No wonder the men failed to foresee what a forceful leader she would be - \"perhaps too forceful\", Manor adds drily.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Sirima soon became Bandaranaike's valued confidante. It was she who persuaded him to resign from the government and the ruling United National Party (UNP) in 1951. She had long been aware of his exasperation at the social and political immobility since independence. Two months later, he formed the Sri Lankan Freedom Party (SLFP), with democratic socialism and Sinhalese resurgence at its heart, setting the party political battle lines in the country for the rest of the century.</p> <p>General elections the following year brought Sirima her first baptism of political fire, as she campaigned on her husband's behalf in his constituency, while he carried his new party's message to the rest of what was still Ceylon. Her reward was the biggest majority for him of any candidate, though the SLFP won only nine seats.</p> <p>At the next elections, in 1956, Bandaranaike won by a landslide and formed a leftwing coalition. The key factor in his victory was the \"Sinhala only\" policy - the promise to replace English with Sinhala as the island's sole official language, and a watershed policy in Ceylonese history. It was aimed at the dominance of the English-speaking elite, but, in fact, sowed the seeds of bitter conflicts with the Tamils. Bandaranaike used Sinhalese chauvinism to gain power, but found he could not control it. And though the influential Buddhist monk who planned his murder in 1959 was motivated primarily by personal grievances, this chauvinism played a part in it.</p> <p>For Mrs Bandaranaike, her husband's death was a traumatic tragedy. One morning, she was in the garden of their house, always open to visitors, when she heard a commotion inside. She rushed indoors to find him collapsing, gravely wounded, with a Buddhist monk pointing a gun at him. She courageously flung herself at the gunman, who was then felled by police fire, but Bandaranaike died in hospital the next day.</p> <p>Sirima was given little time to grieve in peace. The following year, she succumbed to the SLFP's desperate pleas to assume the party leadership, and led it to victory on a wave of public sympathy. The world's first woman prime minister took office in triumph.</p> <p>In the next four years, she forged ahead with the socialist reform programme her husband had initiated - and, indeed, went further. The island was thrust full-tilt into the emerging non-aligned movement; foreign oil companies were nationalised, and all government business was transferred to the state-owned Bank of Ceylon and the new People's Bank, bringing an end to American aid; Soviet aid was sought for industrialisation projects; and education was reformed in favour of the Buddhist Sinhalese.</p> <p>But Mrs Bandaranaike paid a high price. At the end of 1964, under pressure from right-wing Buddhist leaders, some SLFP MPs crossed the floor, and the government collapsed. Sirima lost the next year's elections, but was herself elected to parliament for the first time.</p> <p>Five years on came sweet revenge. In 1970, the United Left Front, led by the SLFP, won a two-thirds majority in parliament, and the socialist bandwagon set off again at full speed - although not fast enough for the militant and disaffected youths of the extreme leftwing People's Liberation Front, the JVP.</p> <p>Having benefited from Mrs Bandaranaike's educational reforms, they found there were still no jobs for them, so, in 1971, they launched an insurrection. It was swiftly crushed, though at the cost of an estimated 1,000 young lives. More than 10,000 were jailed, although most were later released.</p> <p>Deeply shaken, the government pressed on hurriedly with land reform, nationalisation of the tea estates and a new republican constitution, which changed Ceylon's name to Sri Lanka and made Buddhism the state religion - to the dismay of the mainly Hindu Tamils.</p> <p>Mrs Bandaranaike also imposed rigid state control over the economy, which had the now familiar consequences. Under the impact of soaring oil prices, living standards collapsed in a welter of rationing, bureaucracy and corruption. As a result, her SLFP was routed in the 1977 elections, winning a derisory eight seats. The UNP, led by Julius Jayawardene, secured a 75% majority, which he used ruthlessly to tighten the authoritarian regime his predecessor had imposed in her second term. Jayawardene revised the 1972 constitution and had himself elected executive president, setting up an oppressive state with the mere trappings of democracy. In 1980, he vindictively had Sirima's civic rights suspended for seven years for abuse of power - a crime of which he himself soon became much more guilty.</p> <p>With Mrs Bandaranaike unable to play any public role, the SLFP was riven by discord. In the difficult years ahead, her main task was to hold the party together and, with very few cards to play, to counter Jayawardene's devious but masterly manoeuvres.</p> <p>Succession to the party leadership became a bone of contention between her son Anura, who was moving to the right, and her daughter Chandrika, who eventually broke away and, with her popular film-star husband Vijaya Kumaranatunga, formed their own leftwing party - one of whose main aims was to seek a rapprochement with the Tamils. But with her civic rights restored in 1985, Mrs Bandaranaike recovered her place as unchallenged leader and the SLFP's fortunes rose again.</p> <p>After Kumaranatunga's assassination in 1988, Chandrika eventually rejoined the SLFP and, proving herself a consummate politician, secured the party leadership in 1994 at the expense of Anura, who had angrily crossed over to the UNP. But, said Mrs Bandaranaike consolingly: \"He's my son and I love him.\"</p> <p>These were years of mounting violence in Sri Lanka, more often than not initiated by the government or the ruling UNP. After a nationwide pogrom against Tamils in 1983, they took to armed resistance with such effect that, in 1987, India sent in troops to impose a peace settlement. It failed, but Mrs Bandaranaike, once India's greatest ally on the island, hotly opposed the intervention, in the name of the Sinhalese nationalism she had long since embraced.</p> <p>Without influence either in Delhi or among the Tamils, she was powerless to sway events. Nor could she prevent rising violence in the south. In 1989, the JVP, by now more chauvinist than Marxist, was crushed by the UNP government - with vastly greater brutality than in 1971. Estimates of the number slaughtered vary from 30,000 to 70,000; no prisoners were taken and no trials held - a sharp contrast with Mrs Bandaranaike's treatment of the JVP.</p> <p>Her last bid for power came in the presidential elections of 1988, and the parliamentary polls of the following year. With the cards stacked so heavily against her by Jayawardene and his successor, Ranasinghe Premadasa, she could hardly win, though despite all the violence and electoral manipulation he used, Premadasa secured only 50.1% of the votes. However, the UNP lost its two-thirds majority in parliament, its chief weapon in manipulating the constitution. What finally broke the government was Premadasa's assassination in 1993.</p> <p>Reluctant though she was to hand over the reins, age was telling on Mrs Bandaranaike. Impressed by Chandrika's brilliant campaigning, she stepped down just before the parliamentary elections in August 1994. It may have been part of the deal that when Chandrika also won the presidential elections three months later, she appointed her mother prime minister - a symbolic act intended to extirpate Jayawardene's injustice over her civic rights.</p> <p>Real power, however, remained in her daughter's hands. Sirima retired as prime minister last August to allow her daughter to appoint a hardliner, in an attempt to boost the government's fight against Tamil separatists ahead of this week's elections.</p> <p>With a more cosmopolitan outlook than her mother, and influenced by her late husband's ideals, Chandrika made a genuine effort to come to terms with the Tamils. But her father's miscalculations, her mother's ignorance and neglect of the Tamils, and what can only be described as Jayawardene's cynical viciousness towards them, created a legacy of Sinhalese intransigence and Tamil fanaticism that may have made the task impossible.</p> <p>The Bandaranaikes - husband and widow - unquestionably broke the stifling colonial ethos of the English-speaking elite, and restored dignity and a rightful place to the Sinhalese majority. But it was done largely by exploiting their chauvinism, and at the expense of the Tamils, not least because Mrs Bandaranaike, like most Sinhalese, had little concept of her island as a multi-ethnic whole. If a country may be judged by how it treats its minorities, the failure to treat them properly in Sri Lanka has carried a fearsome price, which even yet has not been fully paid.</p> <p>Bandaranaike is survived by her three children.</p> <p>\u0095 Sirima Ratwatte Dias Bandaranaike, politician, born April 17 1916; died October 10 2000.</p>",

Estimates of the number slaughtered vary from 30,000 to 70,000; no prisoners were taken and no trials held - a sharp contrast with Mrs Bandaranaike's treatment of the JVP. Her last bid for power came in the presidential elections of 1988, and the parliamentary polls of the following year. With the cards stacked so heavily against her by Jayawardene and his successor, Ranasinghe Premadasa, she could hardly win, though despite all the violence and electoral manipulation he used, Premadasa secured only 50.1% of the votes. However, the UNP lost its two-thirds majority in parliament, its chief weapon in manipulating the constitution. What finally broke the government was Premadasa's assassination in 1993. Reluctant though she was to hand over the reins, age was telling on Mrs Bandaranaike. Impressed by Chandrika's brilliant campaigning, she stepped down just before the parliamentary elections in August 1994. It may have been part of the deal that when Chandrika also won the presidential elections three months later, she appointed her mother prime minister - a symbolic act intended to extirpate Jayawardene's injustice over her civic rights. Real power, however, remained in her daughter's hands. Sirima retired as prime minister last August to allow her daughter to appoint a hardliner, in an attempt to boost the government's fight against Tamil separatists ahead of this week's elections. With a more cosmopolitan outlook than her mother, and influenced by her late husband's ideals, Chandrika made a genuine effort to come to terms with the Tamils. But her father's miscalculations, her mother's ignorance and neglect of the Tamils, and what can only be described as Jayawardene's cynical viciousness towards them, created a legacy of Sinhalese intransigence and Tamil fanaticism that may have made the task impossible. The Bandaranaikes - husband and widow - unquestionably broke the stifling colonial ethos of the English-speaking elite, and restored dignity and a rightful place to the Sinhalese majority. But it was done largely by exploiting their chauvinism, and at the expense of the Tamils, not least because Mrs Bandaranaike, like most Sinhalese, had little concept of her island as a multi-ethnic whole. If a country may be judged by how it treats its minorities, the failure to treat them properly in Sri Lanka has carried a fearsome price, which even yet has not been fully paid. Bandaranaike is survived by her three children. \u0095 Sirima Ratwatte Dias Bandaranaike, politician, born April 17 1916; died October 10 2000.",

It was terrible to see the boys in a cage, as if they were wild animals,\" she said.",

We didn't even come second. </p> <p>\"Boys from South Africa and Asia were brought up on pitches like this.

We must get used to the conditions and learn to work bloody hard for everything.\" </p> <p>Certainly there must be significant improvements if England are to compete with Pakistan in the one-day series there this month. Not to mention the Test matches in Pakistan and, early next year, Sri Lanka. </p> <p>Five of England's top six were caught in the deep and to make matters worse Craig White and Andrew Caddick were run out. But in truth England never escaped the suffocating stranglehold imposed by the opening bowlers. Shaun Pollock and Roger Telemachus were naggingly accurate and Trescothick and Stewart simply could not get the ball away. </p> <p>Trescothick later managed a few meaty blows before chipping Pollock's slower ball to mid-on, and Hussain was soon caught behind. Then Stewart, who had scored 459 in his previous five one-day international innings for twice out, lofted Donald to deep square-leg. When Graham Thorpe did something similar against the left-arm spin of Nicky Boje, England were 88 for four in the 27th over and in considerable distress. </p> <p>Graeme Hick, who had looked in fine form in his brief innings against Bangladesh and also in the nets, effected a recovery with Andrew Flintoff. They had put on 66 in fewer than 11 overs when Flintoff, in the first over of Pollock's second spell, produced a virtual carbon copy of Stewart's dismissal. He had needed to stay for at least another seven overs so his departure was as grievous as it was unnecessary. </p> <p>White perished to a direct hit by the brilliant Jonty Rhodes.

Paul Grayson, only five days after being called into the party, was caught at slip from what was his first ball in international cricket. Caddick was beaten by Boje's shy at the stumps and Mark Ealham fished and gave Pollock his third victim. England's final six wickets had fallen for 28 runs from 46 deliveries, and their total never looked enough. </p> <p>Hick then held a fine catch above his head at slip and an even better one low to his left in the gully, but South Africa always seemed certain to qualify for the semi-final against India on Friday. </p> <p>Hussain posted four close catchers at times, but it was a fruitless policy.
