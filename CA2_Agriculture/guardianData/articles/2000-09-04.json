At one point shares in the exchange reached \u00a331.50 yesterday before easing back to close at \u00a329.75, valuing the company at close to \u00a3900m. Ahead of the OM bid they were changing hands at around \u00a323. Euronext, which represents the merged Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels exchanges, is now seen as the most likely bidder to challenge OM although it refused to be drawn on the speculation. \"We are looking at the situation very closely, that is all I can say,\" said a spokesman for the Paris bourse last night. One complication for Euronext is that it does not come into existence officially until September 22. That would make it difficult for Euronext to table an offer - particularly if it wanted to make its own shares part of the bid - until after that date. \"Normally it would be logical to wait for their own listing on the stock exchange before making a bid for another exchange but it's always possible they could find some interim financing,\" said one industry source. Although most of the expectation is currently focused on Euronext, it is not the only group seen as a potential bidder. Frankfurt-based Deutsche B\u00f6rse, whose plans to merge with the LSE have been upset by the OM bid, could make a \"white knight\" counter-bid but it would want to bring in other exchanges - Milan and Madrid are the most likely allies - rather than making a solo effort to counter OM. Reuters' agency broker, Instinet, has also been mentioned as a possible bidder. Reuters declined to comment. The OM bid has already forced the London exchange to abandon a planned vote by its shareholders on the merger with the German exchange. That has given shareholders in the London exchange who opposed the merger with the Deutsche B\u00f6rse a platform to argue against the Anglo-German merger. The merger plan was drawn up on a 50-50 basis, which critics said undervalued the London end of the operation. Under the terms of the UK takeover code, OM has 28 days from Monday of last week to send out its formal offer to London exchange shareholders, but it is expected to do so well within the timetable. However, if a rival bidder were to emerge a new timetable would have to be brought in.",

      "body": "<p>Ever since Beethoven, the completion of a ninth symphony has been regarded as a watershed in a composer's development. Hans Werner Henze, who wrote his Ninth Symphony between 1995 and 1997, used the opportunity to write a 55-minute-long choral work, without soloists, in which he came to terms musically and emotionally with a traumatic period of his own early years. He designed the symphony as a summation of his life's work and calls it \"an apotheosis of terror and grief\" - an outpouring of the experience of living in Germany through the 30s and 40s. </p> <p>The novel The Seventh Cross by Anna Seghers was his starting point. Henze asked the writer Hans-Ulrich Treichel, who has been his opera librettist for the last 15 years, to provide him with seven poems based upon the seven characters in the novel, who escape from a concentration camp only to be remorselessly hunted down and crucified. Just one of them survives, so that the seventh cross remains unoccupied. Treichel's texts don't replicate the narrative but impressionistically deal with the horror and fear of being a fugitive, of hiding from the hunters and of being captured. It's a dance of death on a massive scale which allows just a glimmer of hope in the final poem as the last fugitive escapes his persecutors. </p> <p>Every movement in Henze's scheme is dominated by the chorus and their sombre words, yet it is not a quasi-opera nor an oratorio; it is a symphony in its arch-like form and manner. The tumultuous orchestral opening sets the mood in The Escape, as the chorus deliver halting impressions of the fugitive's terror. The second movement is a glacial little slow movement, the third a ferocious scherzo, drastically compressed. The long sixth movement, Night in the Cathedral, is the musical and emotional heart of the work as the escapee hides among the dead; it ends with a string threnody of Mahlerian intensity, and the last movement, with its shreds of optimism, has a provisional, barely affirmative feel. </p> <p>Ingo Metzmacher, who conducted the premiere in Berlin three years ago, took charge of this searing first British performance. The choir, intense and dramatic when required, was again the Berlin Radio Choir, and the orchestra was the BBC Symphony. Henze's Ninth Symphony is an extraordinary piece, a one-off that is never easy listening, but impregnated with a sincerity and power that are deeply moving.</p>",

      "body": "<p>More than a hundred years after its premiere, the world still hasn't made up its mind about Wagner's Parsifal. Is it an outpouring of Christian mysticism, or deeply blasphemous? </p> <p>How much of it is a projection of Wagner's fascination with eastern philosophy on to a legendary western subject? Is the work primarily erotic? Does its portrayal of a uniformed elite harping on about \"purity\" and \"blood\" prefigure Nazism? Most would agree though that the score's noxious beauty still exerts a spellbinding fascination. It certainly did on this occasion. </p> <p>This is the first time Simon Rattle has tackled the complete work in the UK, though he conducted the Netherlands Opera production in 1997. For his Prom performance he used a Dutch orchestra - the Rotterdam Philharmonic, on astonishing form - and some of his original cast. </p> <p>Rattle takes a while to get the balance right. The Prelude has a blinding, crystalline clarity that just falls short of the genuinely mystic. The first appearance of Klingsor's theme is sinister rather than seditious. He doesn't strike form until the first Grail scene, in which the sense of numinous mystery finally becomes apparent. Thereafter he is superlative, swivelling between the sexy and the demonic in act two, and reaching remarkable heights of serenity and anguish in the final act. </p> <p>You're in no doubt, either, that Rattle sees the work as prefiguring much of the repertoire that we most closely associate with him: the flashes forward to Schoenberg in the scene between Parsifal and Kundry; the hints of Debussy in the translucent textures of the Flower Maidens' sequence; above all, the prototype of Mahler's symphonic funeral marches in the tremendous act three interlude. </p> <p>Poul Elming's dark-hued Parsifal brilliantly captures the weariness of the absolute moral responsibility that follows spiritual enlightenment, though he doesn't quite convey boyish innocence in the earlier scenes. Petra Lang's Kundry is better at sexiness than neurosis, though there's no mistaking the quality of her superb voice. As Amfortas, Wolfgang Schoene powerfully projects excruciating physical pain, though the pitch occasionally sags. Robert Lloyd's Gurnemanz remains a superlative achievement, while Sergei Leiferkus, one fluffed entry apart, is the best, most serpentine Klingsor of all.</p>",

      "bodyText": "More than a hundred years after its premiere, the world still hasn't made up its mind about Wagner's Parsifal. Is it an outpouring of Christian mysticism, or deeply blasphemous? How much of it is a projection of Wagner's fascination with eastern philosophy on to a legendary western subject? Is the work primarily erotic? Does its portrayal of a uniformed elite harping on about \"purity\" and \"blood\" prefigure Nazism? Most would agree though that the score's noxious beauty still exerts a spellbinding fascination. It certainly did on this occasion. This is the first time Simon Rattle has tackled the complete work in the UK, though he conducted the Netherlands Opera production in 1997. For his Prom performance he used a Dutch orchestra - the Rotterdam Philharmonic, on astonishing form - and some of his original cast. Rattle takes a while to get the balance right. The Prelude has a blinding, crystalline clarity that just falls short of the genuinely mystic. The first appearance of Klingsor's theme is sinister rather than seditious. He doesn't strike form until the first Grail scene, in which the sense of numinous mystery finally becomes apparent. Thereafter he is superlative, swivelling between the sexy and the demonic in act two, and reaching remarkable heights of serenity and anguish in the final act. You're in no doubt, either, that Rattle sees the work as prefiguring much of the repertoire that we most closely associate with him: the flashes forward to Schoenberg in the scene between Parsifal and Kundry; the hints of Debussy in the translucent textures of the Flower Maidens' sequence; above all, the prototype of Mahler's symphonic funeral marches in the tremendous act three interlude. Poul Elming's dark-hued Parsifal brilliantly captures the weariness of the absolute moral responsibility that follows spiritual enlightenment, though he doesn't quite convey boyish innocence in the earlier scenes. Petra Lang's Kundry is better at sexiness than neurosis, though there's no mistaking the quality of her superb voice. As Amfortas, Wolfgang Schoene powerfully projects excruciating physical pain, though the pitch occasionally sags. Robert Lloyd's Gurnemanz remains a superlative achievement, while Sergei Leiferkus, one fluffed entry apart, is the best, most serpentine Klingsor of all.",

      "body": "<p>As part of the BBC Talent campaign, Radio 1 invited young people with a passion for music and creative ideas to match to apply for six year-long traineeships. Submissions have now been whittled down to the final 50. </p> <p>As well as their creativity and love of music, I want the station's six trainees to bring their enthusiasm, energy and an outside perspective on Radio 1. What we are all about here is having the best understanding of our target audience of anybody in the UK and I think we do pretty well. But we need to work all the time at bringing in a fresh perspective from people who will have a view about everything we do, so, whether it's the website, the playlist or the way the presenters approach their shows, I'm looking for that external view from six young people who have proved they have the ability and staying power to get through this process. </p> <p>From their programme proposals I was mainly looking for originality. There were plenty that expanded 'on existing Radio 1 themes - live music, for example. I saw dozens that suggested we do this live act from that location but what I wanted was \"and we will then do such and such\". In other words, I was looking for the extra creative thinking on top of a pretty standard theme. Alternatively, I was looking for something completely left-field. There were some strange and lovely ideas that I read, and my question was: could we actually achieve this in practice? I would rather have a really inventive and original idea which, after some discussion, we may not be able to do in practice - I'd like to have the discussion about the idea. </p> <p>I was looking for applications that showed the author had real imagination - the ability to idealise, to look for and imagine situations for presenters and so on. I was also looking for candidates to talk about the audience and to really understand how Radio 1 has to suit the mood of the time of day. For example, if you were doing a specialist show with some very new, experimental music, you wouldn't put it out at drivetime. So, just those little clues gave me an insight into how thoroughly they'd been thought through. </p> <p>Another important factor is the ability to communicate on a piece of paper with real impact. There were some well written but very lengthy proposals where I felt one had to work quite hard to understand what the programme was about. If you are an executive producer or an editor at Radio 1, these proposals have to leap off the page and give you a clear picture of the show pretty quickly. The two examples we've selected below are pretty pithy and to the point, giving you an instant flavour of what you will hear. </p> <p>What also stood out in the two proposals we're using as examples was that some really thorough, creative thinking had gone into the ideas and that the authors had thought a lot about the audience, which is very important. In the first of the proposals, there are a dozen fairly well thought-through hooks that would engage listeners. In the second example, the author clearly understands Ant and Dec, their characters, and the way that they relate to audiences. </p> <p>There are a couple of ways the submissions below could be improved. \"Tranceformations\" submitted a list of 15 themed ideas for a specialist show catering for the trance fraternity. However, if you were presenting this to an editor or executive producer you would start with a little summary paragraph to communicate the trance scene. Also, I don't need 15 feature ideas: I would get the impression that this is a quality, thought-through proposal from someone who knows the scene after about eight. You just need to select the ideas that give the indication that you, the producer, really know your stuff as far as trance is concerned. </p> <p>I think \"Ant 'n' Dec's Morning Assembly\" offers a full, creative and striking idea. The candidate probably took too long to explain the quiz mechanics, however: all that needs to be said is that the quiz would involve the teachers and the kids and the specific details would be worked out at a later stage. What I did like about this one is that the candidate clearly understood how Ant and Dec would match in with the 16-year-olds at the school. I like the line: \"School's out - not when it's this much of a laugh!\" It gave me a sense of fun, slapstick and irony, and I like that.</p> <p><strong>Contenders . . . two of the best proposals</strong></p> <p><strong>Tranceformations</strong> </p> <p>\"A change or alteration, especially a radical one.\" A future-based show showcasing new talent, spotting future hits in clubland and the charts. </p> <p><strong> Presented by</strong><br> DJ MTK and guests. </p> <p><strong> Time</strong><br> 4-6am, Sunday and Monday. </p> <p><strong> Musical style</strong><br> Catering to the trance fraternity, eg Time to Burn by Storm; Beautiful by Matt Darey; Fly Away by Unknown; 4 Seasons EP by Sander Kleinberg; Superstring by Cygnus X; Feeling this Way by Conductor and the Cowboy; More and More by Spoiled and Zigo. </p> <p><strong> Features include</strong><br> Distinctive Demo : Send in your tunes, win a chance to get signed. <br> Tranceportation : A monthly slot where a listener's track is reproduced in studio by a top producer. <br>Tranceaction : Top DJs give demonstrations on how to get those mixes right. <br>Spot the Cyber Kid : Find the cyber kid hidden on the Radio 1 website.<br> Spot that Sample : Where did that tune originate? <br> Trancemission : Letters, email and phone-in slot. <br> Sonic Heaven : New equipment tested and demos of results broadcast. <br> What's Hot, What's Not : MTK runs down his trance top-10 chart of what is set to become massive in clubland. <br> Clubbers' Corner : Interactive web chat, with listeners phoning in their reviews of clubs, clubwear and club politics. <br> Industry Insight : Advice on education, books, magazines, shops, studios and labels looking for new talent. <br> Studio Solutions : Your opinion on good home studio set-ups - your problems and our solutions. <br> Gurners' Gallery : Email your photos to the gallery top 10 - can your photo make it to the top spot? <br>Twister Trancer : Strangest tune of the week. </p> <p><strong> Ant 'n' Dec's morning assembly</strong> </p> <p>A classic Radio 1 roadshow with a twist - a week-long live and lively broadcast from five different schools and colleges across the UK, featuring live performances, comedy sketches (like the tactless nit nurse), quizzes and celebrity sports days. The overall feel is fun and funny - heavy on the double entendres but making the most of the double act's personalities and comic acting abilities, and tying in with the school theme as much as possible. </p> <p><strong> Presented by </strong> <br>Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly. </p> <p><strong> Time</strong><br> 9am-11am weekdays, for one week only in August. </p> <p><strong> Musical style</strong><br> Mainstream playlist tracks, charts, new releases and live performances, eg Steps, Craig David, Travis, Alice Deejay. </p> <p><strong> Features include </strong> <br> The Tuckshop : A quiz, introduced as the \"non-stop, news and pop, question swap\". Three students versus three teachers in three rounds spread over the show's two hours. In the first round, the kids (preferably 16-year-olds, to reflect the core Radio 1 audience of young - or young-minded - adults) choose five pop culture questions to ask the teachers. In the second, the teachers choose five current affairs questions to ask in return. Teams must always give a response or a point is taken off, so daft guesses should be encouraged. In the final round, Behind the Bike Shed, Ant and Dec pretend to be a celebrity couple (past or present), and it's open to either team to guess their identities. After the broadcast, a picture of Ant, Dec and all participating pupils and teachers will be posted on the Radio 1 website. The unmistakable vocal talents of Mr Bronson from Grange Hill will be used for pre-recorded links and samples played over tracks. School's out? Not when it's this much of a laugh! </p> <p>\u0095 Andy Parfitt is controller of Radio 1</p>",

In the second example, the author clearly understands Ant and Dec, their characters, and the way that they relate to audiences. There are a couple of ways the submissions below could be improved. \"Tranceformations\" submitted a list of 15 themed ideas for a specialist show catering for the trance fraternity. However, if you were presenting this to an editor or executive producer you would start with a little summary paragraph to communicate the trance scene. Also, I don't need 15 feature ideas: I would get the impression that this is a quality, thought-through proposal from someone who knows the scene after about eight. You just need to select the ideas that give the indication that you, the producer, really know your stuff as far as trance is concerned. I think \"Ant 'n' Dec's Morning Assembly\" offers a full, creative and striking idea. The candidate probably took too long to explain the quiz mechanics, however: all that needs to be said is that the quiz would involve the teachers and the kids and the specific details would be worked out at a later stage. What I did like about this one is that the candidate clearly understood how Ant and Dec would match in with the 16-year-olds at the school. I like the line: \"School's out - not when it's this much of a laugh!\" It gave me a sense of fun, slapstick and irony, and I like that. Contenders . . . two of the best proposals Tranceformations \"A change or alteration, especially a radical one.\" A future-based show showcasing new talent, spotting future hits in clubland and the charts. Presented by DJ MTK and guests. Time 4-6am, Sunday and Monday. Musical style Catering to the trance fraternity, eg Time to Burn by Storm; Beautiful by Matt Darey; Fly Away by Unknown; 4 Seasons EP by Sander Kleinberg; Superstring by Cygnus X; Feeling this Way by Conductor and the Cowboy; More and More by Spoiled and Zigo. Features include Distinctive Demo : Send in your tunes, win a chance to get signed. Tranceportation : A monthly slot where a listener's track is reproduced in studio by a top producer. Tranceaction : Top DJs give demonstrations on how to get those mixes right. Spot the Cyber Kid : Find the cyber kid hidden on the Radio 1 website. Spot that Sample : Where did that tune originate? Trancemission : Letters, email and phone-in slot. Sonic Heaven : New equipment tested and demos of results broadcast. What's Hot, What's Not : MTK runs down his trance top-10 chart of what is set to become massive in clubland. Clubbers' Corner : Interactive web chat, with listeners phoning in their reviews of clubs, clubwear and club politics. Industry Insight : Advice on education, books, magazines, shops, studios and labels looking for new talent. Studio Solutions : Your opinion on good home studio set-ups - your problems and our solutions. Gurners' Gallery : Email your photos to the gallery top 10 - can your photo make it to the top spot? Twister Trancer : Strangest tune of the week. Ant 'n' Dec's morning assembly A classic Radio 1 roadshow with a twist - a week-long live and lively broadcast from five different schools and colleges across the UK, featuring live performances, comedy sketches (like the tactless nit nurse), quizzes and celebrity sports days. The overall feel is fun and funny - heavy on the double entendres but making the most of the double act's personalities and comic acting abilities, and tying in with the school theme as much as possible. Presented by Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly. Time 9am-11am weekdays, for one week only in August. Musical style Mainstream playlist tracks, charts, new releases and live performances, eg Steps, Craig David, Travis, Alice Deejay. Features include The Tuckshop : A quiz, introduced as the \"non-stop, news and pop, question swap\". Three students versus three teachers in three rounds spread over the show's two hours. In the first round, the kids (preferably 16-year-olds, to reflect the core Radio 1 audience of young - or young-minded - adults) choose five pop culture questions to ask the teachers. In the second, the teachers choose five current affairs questions to ask in return. Teams must always give a response or a point is taken off, so daft guesses should be encouraged. In the final round, Behind the Bike Shed, Ant and Dec pretend to be a celebrity couple (past or present), and it's open to either team to guess their identities. After the broadcast, a picture of Ant, Dec and all participating pupils and teachers will be posted on the Radio 1 website. The unmistakable vocal talents of Mr Bronson from Grange Hill will be used for pre-recorded links and samples played over tracks. School's out? Not when it's this much of a laugh! \u0095 Andy Parfitt is controller of Radio 1",

      "body": "<p>Often described as the most formidable woman in British television, Patricia Hodgson is at the door of her new habitat, the chief executive's office of the independent television commission (ITC). She is beaming with pleasure; or it may be power. </p> <p>Minutes into the interview she has dispensed with the habitual caution of a BBC lifer and is speaking recklessly. Formerly John Birt's right-hand woman, she played the villain's part to perfection as his much-loathed director of policy and planning. Now she has left the BBC, she's \"going for it\", prepared to risk a showdown. </p> <p>Her agenda is to salvage the ITC from extinction: to fix the row with ITV over News at Ten by the end of this month; save the thing she cares about most - public service broadcasting - and ensure the forthcoming white paper on media, communications and \"convergence\" remembers that broadcasting has cultural obligations. No mean feat. </p> <p>As she sees it, the ITC, as the licensing body until new legislation comes in, has the power to make public service broadcasting worthwhile in business terms. It can cut the annual \"levy\" payments by ITV, and negotiate altered terms (\"don't call it relaxation\"), but in return for more programme investment. Seven licence-holders, including Central, LWT and Granada, are about to apply to renew their franchises and, consequently, renegotiate their annual licence payments. The ITC still controls some important levers and Hodgson has the nerve to use them. </p> <p>Her determination was apparent when she spoke at last week's Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival about the forthcoming white paper. Her appointment - she starts officially today - changes the balance of the regulatory environment. Her predecessor, Peter Rogers, was shy and decent but lacked the confidence of the industry; with his retirement, the ITC could become far more assertive. </p> <p>In her Edinburgh speech, she also gave her views on the BBC governors. \"They are needed,\" she said, \"to keep the BBC management honest. They should be strong enough to keep politicians at bay. But they, too, must be accountable. They can't convincingly embody the BBC and then also judge it.\" BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland accepts this, she says. </p> <p>Back to the ITC. \"I took the job because it is an opportunity to make a difference. The challenge is to achieve a new settlement for public service broadcasting, to take the free-to-air networks [ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5] into the new digital age over the next 10 years.\" It is very late in the day, she concedes, but possible. ITV is being offered a deal. She will move \"further and faster on [simplifying] regulation\", with the prospect of more \"flexible\" schedules and advertising controls. But it must keep faith with its most important public service duties, providing \"range and quality\" - above all, serious news and modernised current affairs. </p> <p>The clue to Hodgson is that she is a politician manqu\u00e9. At Cambridge she was a committee member of the university Conservative association, then worked for the Conservative Research Department, even contesting a London seat. She plays the political chess game like a grandmaster - unlike the ITC before her arrival, with its abandonment of News at Ten two years ago. The ITC has \"not been sufficiently confident of its skills and professionalism in a changing world,\" she says. \"It needs confidence.\" </p> <p>Her answer is strengthened leadership - ie, herself - and new recruits with economic and strategic expertise - presumably ex-colleagues from BBC policy and planning looking for a new world to conquer. The watchdog could then regain the ear of government. </p> <p>But the first aim, clear in Edinburgh, is a face-saving deal with ITV before it goes to court at the end of this month for a judicial review of the commission's edict effectively ordering the broadcaster to restore News at Ten. The two sides can \"talk up to the courtroom door,\" Hodgson says. </p> <p>She pounced instantly on an olive branch offered by Charles Allen, chief executive of Granada Media Group. Hodgson scents a deal. \"It's the first time anyone of great seniority and influence has wanted to talk.\" </p> <p>It is her good fortune to take over as ITV consolidates into two big power blocs, far easier to deal with, and when one awkward baron, Lord Hollick, is exiting. Salvaging the ITC's reputation rests on keeping this dispute out of court. \"We shouldn't be where we are,\" says Hodgson, insisting that \"it's not about the 10pm slot\" - though she repeats that \"11pm is too late\". She says there are plenty of other options now that the BBC is switching its news to 10pm; the important thing is to ensure optimum accessibility to improve audiences. </p> <p>Taking a line calculated to please politicians, Hodgson argues that \"however excellent the BBC news is, dominance by any news service is not good for democracy.\" Some news, she says, inevitably then \"gets left out\". </p> <p>If the dispute proceeds to judicial review, she says, \"it will tie my hands in modernising regulation [as ITV wants] ... I might have the best scheme in the world to simplify regulation, but how can we talk about it if we're having a great big barney?\" </p> <p>Her other priority is to mould the white paper on media convergence, and, one suspects, temper the drive, led by the Department of Trade and Industry, towards a telecoms-driven regime where social obligations scarcely feature. She is seeking recognition that terrestrial networks need \"transitional arrangements\" in which consumer protection and duties, such as investment in high-quality regional programmes, can be traded for privileges, such as guarantees of being given prominence on all platforms and electronic programme guides. </p> <p>But this is not what ITV executives seem to worry about in public. Rather, they cry out for a level playing field with freedom to dump genres such as religion and compete head-on with the likes of Sky. </p> <p>\"When their minds are focused, ITV executives recognise the validity of the requirements of diversity,\" Hodgson says. \"I have a good deal of sympathy with their frustrations. Now ITV is settling its ownership issues we'll start talking about the right mix of self-set aspirational and mandatory targets.\" </p> <p>She wants to open discussions with licensees and the government, and also see a proper digital strategy in place for ITV, akin to the BBC's which she helped to devise, and Channel 4's. \"My hope is to make content regulation simpler, clearer, less complex, to reflect all the things ITV complains of, but holding onto the essentials.\" She points to the success of the tougher yet aspirational Channel 4 licence agreement introduced two years ago as a model: multi-cultural programmes, for example, have been moved out of ghetto slots to prime time. </p> <p>In her Edinburgh speech, Hodgson asked: \"Will the multi-channel interactive world provide all the content audiences need?\" She, naturally, answered her own question: \"Given the power and pervasive nature of the electronic media, I think we'll continue to do so in a big way. How it's done, through the BBC, through privileges for some players on the commercial side, needs to be worked out. Someone has to do that, with, but independent of, government.\" It's a vision that handily keeps the ITC, or something like it, in business. </p> <p>Once described by Guardian writer Dave Hill as \"a woman apparently sculpted from deep-frozen Oil of Ulay\", Hodgson has never been short of detractors. Behind her back some of the important executives she has to rub along with range from sceptical to antagonistic (told this, she just says \"what fun!\"). Asked about hostile predictions that she will bring a bossy BBC perspective to a commercial sector where she has never worked, she counters that she \"learned a fair bit about the commercial world when I served on the monopolies and mergers commission [forerunner to the competition commission] for six years.\" Instead of \"nannying\" the network, her aim is \"a new deal - to achieve simpler regulations, and only when they're needed\". Far from imposing a BBC perspective, she backs further consolidation: \"One ITV is the target. It is not only inevitable, it is desirable.\" </p> <p>Another charge is that she has a personal agenda, to emerge from the expected cull of watchdogs as top dog, regulating the content of electronic media (and those BBC governors), within or outside of a new economic regulator, called perhaps Ofcom. She simply wants to ensure the ITC is respected, and works with other regulators to \"design together a new framework\", she answers. </p> <p>Those who admire Hodgson - citing such BBC coups as the renewal of its charter in 1996, and this year's licence fee settlement, which makes possible Greg Dyke's new programme spending - say she will be a very good thing for the ITC, and its currently anxious staff. And for viewers. </p> <p>At Edinburgh, Dyke used his MacTaggart lecture to opine that advertising-funded channels such as ITV will find it hard as television fragments. Hodgson responds with vigour. \"Greg is wrong. All free-to-air channels will be showcases for much bigger media companies. The money will be there. I love this sector, and I have an opportunity to get it right.\" </p> <p>Not to be under-estimated.</p>",

Once described by Guardian writer Dave Hill as \"a woman apparently sculpted from deep-frozen Oil of Ulay\", Hodgson has never been short of detractors. Behind her back some of the important executives she has to rub along with range from sceptical to antagonistic (told this, she just says \"what fun!\"). Asked about hostile predictions that she will bring a bossy BBC perspective to a commercial sector where she has never worked, she counters that she \"learned a fair bit about the commercial world when I served on the monopolies and mergers commission [forerunner to the competition commission] for six years.\" Instead of \"nannying\" the network, her aim is \"a new deal - to achieve simpler regulations, and only when they're needed\". Far from imposing a BBC perspective, she backs further consolidation: \"One ITV is the target. It is not only inevitable, it is desirable.\" Another charge is that she has a personal agenda, to emerge from the expected cull of watchdogs as top dog, regulating the content of electronic media (and those BBC governors), within or outside of a new economic regulator, called perhaps Ofcom. She simply wants to ensure the ITC is respected, and works with other regulators to \"design together a new framework\", she answers. Those who admire Hodgson - citing such BBC coups as the renewal of its charter in 1996, and this year's licence fee settlement, which makes possible Greg Dyke's new programme spending - say she will be a very good thing for the ITC, and its currently anxious staff. And for viewers. At Edinburgh, Dyke used his MacTaggart lecture to opine that advertising-funded channels such as ITV will find it hard as television fragments. Hodgson responds with vigour. \"Greg is wrong. All free-to-air channels will be showcases for much bigger media companies. The money will be there. I love this sector, and I have an opportunity to get it right.\" Not to be under-estimated.",

Valuable lessons about this fledgling market have been learned, but huge cash piles have been used up, and there has already been one loser. </p> <p>On top of the growing pains, the imminent arrival of two powerful US players into the UK later this year - <a href=\"http://www.iVillage.com\" target=\"_NEW\">iVillage</a>, backed by Tesco, and Hearst-owned <a href=\"http://www.uk.women.com\" target=\"_NEW\">uk.women.com</a> under the aegis of NatMags - has forced British publishers to reassess who their audience is and where their real revenue is coming from. E-commerce has not experienced the growth that was projected in the last year, and start-ups like the Ready2 network, founded by journalists Susannah Constantine and Trinny Woodall, have been forced to cut their operations back. The Americans, boasting five years of experience over their competitors, regard the British market as underdeveloped - in other words, it had better grow up fast. </p> <p>The replacement of Charlotte Street's launch editor Nicola Davenport by Maria Trkulja, head of marketing at e-retailer Zoom, was the first sign that Associated News and Media's site was having an identity crisis. No one was surprised by the announcement last month that it was planning a complete overhaul of the brand (it has been lagging behind its competitors who all claim around 200,000 unique users a month). The interesting part was that it was being repositioned to a tighter \"middle youth\" niche of 29 to 45-year-olds, targeting Associated's more established readerships and drawing on You magazine, Femail and the Evening Standard for content. </p> <p>There was palpable surprise, however, when Hilary Burden, Beme's very capable launch editor, was asked to go. Burden commented at the time: \"We have all our advertising booked up and we are the envy of our competitors, but the lack of e-commerce will be the death of the women's portal.\" The appointment of a new commercial director, Sarah Fitzgerald, before a new editor, shows where IPC's priorities lie. </p> <p>The lessons (which the analysts have been predicting for some time) are plain for all to see: women's portals have been too general in their offerings, failing to distinguish themselves sufficiently from each other and too slow to develop their commerce strategies. \"Lack of clear commerce strategies is a big failure at the moment,\" says Rebecca Ulph of Forrester Research. \"Publishing companies are used to thinking of advertising as their main revenue, but e-commerce is the only way forward.\" </p> <p>Without online transactions, the current UK model, with overbearing editorial and marketing costs, is unsustainable. \"It's still too early to tell whether UK women's portals will prove commercially successful - they've all had such limited lifespans,\" says Hilary Burden. </p> <p>The invaders have timed their entry into the marketplace well, striking when the herd is turning and the weaklings are starting to reveal themselves. \"They're getting to know the beast before attacking,\" says Burden. </p> <p>So could the Americans beat the Brits on their own turf? \"There is just no way that six generic sites could possibly survive side by side - only the fittest will survive,\" says Ulph, pointing to the US market where only two players (iVillage and Women.com) dominate the field. She suspects only two of the current UK players will survive. While Beme and Charlotte Street appear to be consolidating their audience in niche areas, Hollinger and Boots-backed Handbag (still the market leader with 200,000 unique users a month and 55% recognition) and iCircle are sticking belligerently to a \"no change\" policy and will be going head to head with the Americans. </p> <p>The restructuring at Charlotte Street is not surrender but a case of adapt and survive, insists its management. Kevin Beatty, chief operating officer at Associated New Media, declares that they are \"totally committed to this market as demonstrated by the significant resources and investment we are making in improving this part of our network.\" </p> <p>Charlotte Street's main concerns are the same as its rivals. \"The market up to this point has been immature,\" says Beatty. \"Our challenge is to attract and retain the right audience in order that our women's portal becomes a powerful medium through which to advertise goods and services.\" </p> <p>He dismisses rumours that You.co.uk will be replacing the beleaguered women's site, but confirms that they are planning a wholesale re-branding (they are consulting externally on the name), which will be targeting a woman of a \"certain attitude\": namely smart, at a professional level in her job, probably in a relationship, maybe with kids, who has \"some knowledge of the web or is about to adopt it.\" The Charlotte Street site will be part of the new offering. </p> <p>As for Beme - which has already firmly aligned itself with the 18 to 35-year-old market through its co-branding with the popular drama Ally McBeal - managing director Linda Lancaster-Gaye confirms: \"It is too early to start defining the market, but we are getting more feedback from the users and from that we are developing our commercial strategy.\" </p> <p>How big a threat do the Americans represent? In terms of groundbreaking creative editorial, the Brits don't have much to worry about, but in depth of content, services and tools, and sheer financial muscle the newcomers tower over them. </p> <p>iVillage has 190,000 pages of editorial content, a virtual hypermarket of useful information, \"expert\" advice, discussion groups and community chat - everything from your son's acne to the price of Amazon shares - aggregated according to \"life stage\".

The development costs can be spread across multiple distribution platforms enabling the production company to be in a better position to keep its rights. \u0095 Peter Cowley is director of broadband and television at Freeserve.

      "byline": "Roy Greenslade",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Scotland today is the Fleet Street of the 30s. Newspapers are engaged in a vicious circulation war, with groups using every possible device to win readers. The weapons are commercial - price-cutting gimmicks, massive \"sampling\" giveaways and promotional lures - but the pressure on editors to produce saleable papers, to ensure that the casual buyers stay, is immense. </p> <p>It is possible, therefore, to put Martin Clarke's departure as editor of the Daily Record in this context. That would suggest that he is just another casualty in the debilitating round of journalistic blood-letting. </p> <p>Then again, Clarke stands out from the crowd. There can be little doubt that he was monstrously behaved, exhibiting the man-management skills of a galley-master on a Greek trireme. </p> <p>There are legions of stories about his ranting and raving in the office, his rudeness to subordinates and his lack of respect for his superiors. It is also obvious that he alienated his paper's traditional political allies in the Labour party. In his enthusiasm to end the so-called cosy relationship with the party hierarchy, he went too far. </p> <p>Not only did he upset the party, it is highly likely that he annoyed habitual Labour voters among his readership, too. Similarly, his controversial campaign against the repeal of Clause 28 may well have played well with older buyers but is thought to have bemused, and even incensed, younger people. </p> <p>Then there is the not unimportant matter of circulation. The Daily Record has sold fewer and fewer copies since Clarke arrived in April 1998 when it was selling 671,000. By April this year (the fairest of comparisons) it had fallen to 618,000, a drop of almost 8%. </p> <p>But that does not give anything like the whole picture. The Record has enjoyed - how shall I put this tactfully? - an oddly high level of sales in Spain. It has also been reliant on increasing numbers of bulk giveaways. </p> <p>As if that wasn't bad enough, rival circulation managers claim the paper's Scots-only sale dipped as low as 516,000 last week. Even if that's an exaggeration, and Trinity-Mirror argue that its monthly year-on-year sale will show a slight rise when the next officially audited figures are published, the sales situation is dire. </p> <p>Not that Clarke can be held entirely responsible for that. The Record held sway in Scotland for a couple of generations as its main competitors retreated south of the border. For years, the Daily Express and Daily Mail virtually abandoned Scotland. Even the Sun was slow to make its mark there. </p> <p>But once the whole newspaper market began to slide in the early 90s, managements desperate to boost circulation showed a renewed interest in Scotland, turning it into the most competitive newspaper environment of modern times. In most of the larger cities, there are at least 15 daily morning titles on the news-stands, with a 16th, the Swedish-owned Business am, about to be launched in three weeks' time. The populous Glasgow-Edinburgh central region is also served by a free Metro, which has a distribution of 120,000 copies. </p> <p>To be frank, in a country of 5.1m, the market is overheated. Even some Scottish editors agree with me that there are too many titles chasing too few readers, not to mention the problems of too few good journalists to staff the papers, and too few good stories to publish. </p> <p>The Scots don't seem to mind. With almost every title slashing its cover price, they can cherry-pick the cheapest available paper. The latest Daily Express voucher mail shot is offering one issue a week for just 1p. </p> <p>In such a climate, with buyers able to judge value for money every day, it isn't hard to see why a 20p Scotsman and a 20p Times might be preferred over a 48p Herald. It is surely creditable that the Herald has managed to keep a 95,000 sale so far, but price-cutting isn't any longer a short-term weapon. It is a war of attrition and it is difficult to forecast the outcome. </p> <p>Among the red-tops, the Daily Record has found it harder to retain reader loyalty for a paper selling at 32p against a cheaper Mirror and a Sun which slips in 15p issues on a weekly basis. Price-cutting also helped the Daily Mail to build a healthy sale before it reverted to its proper cover price. </p> <p>The result has seen the Sun climb to an astonishing 400,000, double its sale three years ago, and the Mirror to 60,000 from almost zero. With the Mail at 120,000 and rising, and the Express at almost 90,000, the Daily Record has borne the brunt of the onslaught. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, Clarke's friends contend that his owners have failed to provide him with the resources to fight back, implying that Trinity-Mirror's treatment of the Record as a regional rather than national title inhibits proper investment. They claim the lack of management understanding explains why he was prone to lose his temper so often. </p> <p>A Trinity-Mirror source scoffed at any such suggestion. \"It sounds,\" he said witheringly, \"like the squeal of the last little piggy down the ramp into the abattoir.\" </p> <p>But one of Clarke's friends countered: \"In a war like the one we have here it makes no sense to remove the man recognised as the toughest, meanest general from the battlefield.\" </p> <p>That's probably the reason Clarke was shocked when Trinity-Mirror's chief executive Philip Graf fired him at a tense meeting in Canary Wharf. The arrogant and abrasive Clarke simply had no inkling he was for the chop. </p> <p>So can the new editor, Peter Cox, who is moving from the Record's stable-mate, the Sunday Mail, expect to do better? He is a more amenable, amiable character.

      "bodyText": "Scotland today is the Fleet Street of the 30s. Newspapers are engaged in a vicious circulation war, with groups using every possible device to win readers. The weapons are commercial - price-cutting gimmicks, massive \"sampling\" giveaways and promotional lures - but the pressure on editors to produce saleable papers, to ensure that the casual buyers stay, is immense. It is possible, therefore, to put Martin Clarke's departure as editor of the Daily Record in this context. That would suggest that he is just another casualty in the debilitating round of journalistic blood-letting. Then again, Clarke stands out from the crowd. There can be little doubt that he was monstrously behaved, exhibiting the man-management skills of a galley-master on a Greek trireme. There are legions of stories about his ranting and raving in the office, his rudeness to subordinates and his lack of respect for his superiors. It is also obvious that he alienated his paper's traditional political allies in the Labour party. In his enthusiasm to end the so-called cosy relationship with the party hierarchy, he went too far. Not only did he upset the party, it is highly likely that he annoyed habitual Labour voters among his readership, too. Similarly, his controversial campaign against the repeal of Clause 28 may well have played well with older buyers but is thought to have bemused, and even incensed, younger people. Then there is the not unimportant matter of circulation. The Daily Record has sold fewer and fewer copies since Clarke arrived in April 1998 when it was selling 671,000. By April this year (the fairest of comparisons) it had fallen to 618,000, a drop of almost 8%. But that does not give anything like the whole picture. The Record has enjoyed - how shall I put this tactfully? - an oddly high level of sales in Spain. It has also been reliant on increasing numbers of bulk giveaways. As if that wasn't bad enough, rival circulation managers claim the paper's Scots-only sale dipped as low as 516,000 last week. Even if that's an exaggeration, and Trinity-Mirror argue that its monthly year-on-year sale will show a slight rise when the next officially audited figures are published, the sales situation is dire. Not that Clarke can be held entirely responsible for that. The Record held sway in Scotland for a couple of generations as its main competitors retreated south of the border. For years, the Daily Express and Daily Mail virtually abandoned Scotland. Even the Sun was slow to make its mark there. But once the whole newspaper market began to slide in the early 90s, managements desperate to boost circulation showed a renewed interest in Scotland, turning it into the most competitive newspaper environment of modern times. In most of the larger cities, there are at least 15 daily morning titles on the news-stands, with a 16th, the Swedish-owned Business am, about to be launched in three weeks' time. The populous Glasgow-Edinburgh central region is also served by a free Metro, which has a distribution of 120,000 copies. To be frank, in a country of 5.1m, the market is overheated. Even some Scottish editors agree with me that there are too many titles chasing too few readers, not to mention the problems of too few good journalists to staff the papers, and too few good stories to publish. The Scots don't seem to mind. With almost every title slashing its cover price, they can cherry-pick the cheapest available paper. The latest Daily Express voucher mail shot is offering one issue a week for just 1p. In such a climate, with buyers able to judge value for money every day, it isn't hard to see why a 20p Scotsman and a 20p Times might be preferred over a 48p Herald. It is surely creditable that the Herald has managed to keep a 95,000 sale so far, but price-cutting isn't any longer a short-term weapon. It is a war of attrition and it is difficult to forecast the outcome. Among the red-tops, the Daily Record has found it harder to retain reader loyalty for a paper selling at 32p against a cheaper Mirror and a Sun which slips in 15p issues on a weekly basis. Price-cutting also helped the Daily Mail to build a healthy sale before it reverted to its proper cover price. The result has seen the Sun climb to an astonishing 400,000, double its sale three years ago, and the Mirror to 60,000 from almost zero. With the Mail at 120,000 and rising, and the Express at almost 90,000, the Daily Record has borne the brunt of the onslaught. Not surprisingly, Clarke's friends contend that his owners have failed to provide him with the resources to fight back, implying that Trinity-Mirror's treatment of the Record as a regional rather than national title inhibits proper investment. They claim the lack of management understanding explains why he was prone to lose his temper so often. A Trinity-Mirror source scoffed at any such suggestion. \"It sounds,\" he said witheringly, \"like the squeal of the last little piggy down the ramp into the abattoir.\" But one of Clarke's friends countered: \"In a war like the one we have here it makes no sense to remove the man recognised as the toughest, meanest general from the battlefield.\" That's probably the reason Clarke was shocked when Trinity-Mirror's chief executive Philip Graf fired him at a tense meeting in Canary Wharf. The arrogant and abrasive Clarke simply had no inkling he was for the chop. So can the new editor, Peter Cox, who is moving from the Record's stable-mate, the Sunday Mail, expect to do better? He is a more amenable, amiable character. Even when I criticised him harshly for one of his stories, he didn't lose his sense of humour and was prepared to fight his corner without rancour. His paper has been unimpressive, and has also shed some readers, but it has remained coherent - the Record, meanwhile, has been erratic: sensational one minute and overly serious and dull the next. Cox did pursue a much more sympathetic line over Clause 28 and, after an initial hiccup, has offered tacit support to the Labour administration of Scottish first minister Donald Dewar. It was surely significant that his first Daily Record front page, on Friday, contained the pro-Dewar headline, \"Well Don!\"",

Did I listen to Radio 2 between 10.30 and 11.00? Or was it Capital? Or was it Virgin? No, that was 11.30-12.00. This absurd charade is carried out by 100,000 people every year in order to put together the ratings for all Britain's 350 radio stations. </p> <p>It's called Rajar, but I believe that its days are numbered. In the newspaper business you can be sure the sales figures are right because they are based on the amount of money taken against the number sent out to newsagents minus the returns. Television is done technologically with a box over the set which records all given viewing. But radio is based on the widely discredited diary system where somebody has to try and record exactly what they listened to that hour, that day or that week. What astounds me the most is that the radio business is not up in arms seeking a change. </p> <p>It's not as if there are no alternatives. Since the early 80s, a number of companies have been developing systems that measure radio audiences using electronic meters worn by survey participants. These meters pick up radio signals and accurately record who listened to what and when. Accurate, reliable, no guesswork and no reliance on memory. </p> <p>Not only are meters accurate, but they can deliver up-to-date information that should be the norm for the radio industry. With the current diary system, national stations receive their results on a quarterly basis. Because of this time lag, some figures for the quarter are almost five months old. With meters, we could receive results at worst after a week and at best overnight. </p> <p>Surprisingly, the companies developing meters have received little or no support from the radio industry in the UK. </p> <p>Perhaps if we were to examine the effect that moving from a diary system to electronic meters has on listening figures, then we might get an insight into the reticence of the industry to force what seems an irresistible change. </p> <p>A clue to this effect can be found in the US television industry in the 80s, where the federal communications commission insisted on a certain number of markets converting from diaries to meters every year. The major networks fought tooth and nail to slow down the changeover. </p> <p>The reason was simple: every time the switchover was made, the networks lost millions of dollars in advertising revenue. This was because the diary system worked for the networks. Diaries rely on people's recall, so the networks scored inaccurately high ratings while the smaller cable stations suffered. Once meters accurately recorded what people were actually watching, the result was always the same: networks lost viewers and cable gained. </p> <p>Already, one company actively involved in introducing a radio metering system in the UK acknowledges that the effect would be the same with the radio audience figures. Diaries favour established radio stations or stations with large marketing budgets as they are more easily recalled; meters reflect the true picture... so that smaller, lower-profile stations get a fairer share. </p> <p>Let me declare an interest. (Am I not allowed an interest?) Private research that we did at TalkSport shows that when we broadcast live and exclusive coverage of the Test series in South Africa, for every listener who said correctly that they heard the cricket on TalkSport, two other listeners were convinced they heard our coverage on either Radio 4 or 5 Live. A diary would have reflected the listener's error while a meter would have given us the correct result. </p> <p>So we begin to understand why the enthusiasm for radio metering is lukewarm among those radio stations enjoying great ratings with diaries... best typified by the old joke about John Major activists chanting: \"What do we want? Gradual change! When do we want it? In due course!\" </p> <p>One victim of this attitude is the American audience research company Arbitron, which has spent millions in a test operation for its portable people meter (PPM) system in Manchester. From 1998 until early this year, 300 meters had been distributed to Mancunians for testing. </p> <p>The meters - worn like a bleeper - detect inaudible codes that broadcasters embed in the audio using encoders provided by Arbitron. At the end of the day, the meter-wearer places the meter onto a base station that recharges and sends the collected codes to Arbitron for tabulation. </p> <p>The problem Arbitron faced was that its system required the cooperation of all broadcasters in order to work. Talk Radio, as it was then - in common with all other commercial broadcasters, as well as the BBC local station GMR - agreed to encode its broadcasts. </p> <p>After a week, however, all the BBC's national stations pulled out. The reason they cited was that they received complaints of a buzz from Radio 3 listeners. No other stations taking part in the test experienced the same problem. Nevertheless, Arbitron spent more than two years trying to persuade the BBC to rejoin the test - but without success. </p> <p>Consequently, the Arbitron test was flawed as it did not measure all radio listening. The company has now abandoned Manchester and decided to complete its testing in Philadelphia, where one has to assume the atmosphere is more favourable to an accurate system of measuring ratings. </p> <p>There is, however, another metering system that is being developed that does not require the cooperation of all broadcasters. A Swiss company, SRG SSR, has developed a digital wristwatch, Radiocontrol, with a built-in microphone which picks up all audio that the wearer is listening to. </p> <p>SRG SSR matches the wristwatch audio with the radio stations' audio to find out what the survey participant was listening to. The company began distributing the watches in July and expects testing to be complete by the end of this year. The system, which will be used by the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, should be fully operational from January 2001, with published results in the spring. </p> <p> Interestingly, when we spoke to Manuel Dahler, head of radio research at SRG SSR, he told us that TalkSport's inquiry was the first sign of interest from the radio industry in the UK. </p> <p>Yet this resistance to change is impossible to sustain. Not only is it wrong-headed to cling to a system that's akin to reading tea leaves, but the diary system is incapable of coping with the changes in the radio industry, not least the explosion in Manchester. </p> <p>The perceived radio industry wisdom that people listen to only two radio stations is nonsense. It is born out of the frailties of the diary system. The increase in the number of stations people can tune into has made the diary system notoriously simplistic - and that is before the changeover to digital adds more stations into the market. </p> <p>Common sense tells us that people in Britain listen to more radio stations than ever. It's just that no one is measuring their listening accurately. That is bad news for advertisers, who are paying top dollar for inflated ratings created by an out-of-date, flawed system. So it is in the advertisers' interests - if not some of my commercial rivals' and certainly not the BBC's - to join me in my efforts to place the implementation of a metering system in the UK on the front burner. </p> <p>Only when meters measure radio ratings will everyone in this multi-million pound industry get their money's worth. That could be good news for many, bad news for some - but whatever the impact, at least it would be accurate. </p> <p>\u0095 Kelvin MacKenzie is chairman and chief executive of the Wireless Group</p>",

Yesterday the first of a series of self-penned \"letters\" about her student life appeared in the Mail on Sunday.</p> <p>Mr Kelley, head at Monkseaton school, Whitley Bay, and Mr Brown lambasted the Oxford admissions procedure as elitist when she was rejected before she got her A-level results, which turned out to be five As.</p> <p>\"To be honest, I never disputed my Oxford rejection,\" Miss Spence wrote. \"I simply got on with life. My position in the centre of the row was difficult. I could see the logic in both sides of the argument. Optimising the egalitarianism of admissions procedures is a complex problem and not one that is experienced only by universities. I thought that commenting would have protracted the debate, so I tried to channel my energies into revision.\" But \"in retrospect I think it may have been worthwhile to discuss openly a topic which was so close to the hearts of many\".</p> <p>Choosing Harvard was one of \"the hardest decisions I have ever had to take\". She had been accepted by Newcastle, Nottingham and Edinburgh. Ultimately the choice was between Harvard and Newcastle. \"At Newcastle I could read medicine.

      "bodyText": "Laura Spence, the Tyneside comprehensive student whose rejection by Oxford University became a national cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, yesterday said she could \"see the logic\" in the university's argument. In her first public comment on the affair, Miss Spence is more conciliatory towards Magdalen College, Oxford, which turned her down for a place to read medicine, than were her headteacher, Paul Kelley, and the chancellor, Gordon Brown. Miss Spence is going instead to Harvard University in Massachusetts to read biochemistry. Yesterday the first of a series of self-penned \"letters\" about her student life appeared in the Mail on Sunday. Mr Kelley, head at Monkseaton school, Whitley Bay, and Mr Brown lambasted the Oxford admissions procedure as elitist when she was rejected before she got her A-level results, which turned out to be five As. \"To be honest, I never disputed my Oxford rejection,\" Miss Spence wrote. \"I simply got on with life. My position in the centre of the row was difficult. I could see the logic in both sides of the argument. Optimising the egalitarianism of admissions procedures is a complex problem and not one that is experienced only by universities. I thought that commenting would have protracted the debate, so I tried to channel my energies into revision.\" But \"in retrospect I think it may have been worthwhile to discuss openly a topic which was so close to the hearts of many\". Choosing Harvard was one of \"the hardest decisions I have ever had to take\". She had been accepted by Newcastle, Nottingham and Edinburgh. Ultimately the choice was between Harvard and Newcastle. \"At Newcastle I could read medicine. At Harvard I would be required to pursue a broader course of study. This would allow many possible career options but would mean an extra two years if I wanted to become a doctor.\" She spoke of her joy on getting her results: \"When I rang home and told my mum that I had not only got five As, but received a letter from the examinations board saying I had achieved one of the five best geography results in the country, I could tell she was pleased.\" \u0095 Officials embroiled in the fiasco in which thousands of Scottish pupils received incorrect or inaccurate exam results last night defended a visit by Omani education ministry officials intended to show off Scottish exam expertise.

Even as a red-blooded male, I must admit to a certain frisson of sexual excitement every time the old smoothie utters one of his catchphrases, such as 'Tremendous, smashing or brilliant.'\" British Eurosport: World Cup Football (6pm) \"His footballing talent is remembered by young and old throughout the country, his smog-monster Middlesbrough accent is ready-made for TV, his smooth debonair charm is a hit with the ladies,\" he continues Sky Sports 1: World Football Show (7.30pm) And there's more: \"Put the powerful voice of the Fiver behind what this nation truly wants. Together, we can make Kamara great!\" Gareth insists. Sky Sports 1: You're On Sky Sports! (10pm, 2.30am) But surely the nation loves McCaff, not Kamara. Don't you?!",

      "bodyText": "Today, in Downing Street, Prime Minister Tony Blair will meet the widow of a 1989 murder victim. Geraldine Finucane will have finally made it to the heart of the government she believes played a part in her husband's assassination. Mr Blair will require more than his famous charm and caring ear to assuage the widow of Pat Finucane. The story begins three weeks before the Belfast solicitor was shot 14 times by members of the Ulster Freedom Fighters. The murder gang knocked down Finucane's front door in his north Belfast home as the family sat down for Sunday dinner. Geraldine Finucane was shot in the foot as she tried to protect their three children. An RUC detective investigating the killing described it at the time as \"the most ferocious murder I have come across. Every shot seemed to strike home and I believe the gunmen involved had murdered before.\" An immediate question that arose from the killing came from a statement made in the House of Commons three weeks before the killing. A Junior Home Office Minister, Douglas Hogg, told the House of Commons \"that there are in Northern Ireland a number of solicitors who are unduly sympathetic to the cause of the IRA.\" Hogg's comments were immediately condemned by the SDLP MP Seamus Mallon, who said that \"it would be on the Minister's head, and on the heads of the government, if an assasin's bullet did what his words had done.\" The NI Law Society accused Hogg of creating \"an excuse for terrorist organisations to carry out murders - something which was not available to them before.\" Then other strange things began to emerge. In 1992, the BBC Panorama programme broadcast allegations that the UDA were plotting to kill Finucane and that British Army Intelligence were warned in advance. The allegations came from Brian Nelson, who was, as well as a spook for the FRU (Forces Reconnaisance Unit), the Intelligence Officer for the UDA in West Belfast. Further allegations were made claiming that loyalist suspects under interrogation in Castlereagh Holding Centre were told by RUC Special Branch Officers that Finucane and two other nationalist solicitors were senior figures in the IRA. The UDA statement that claimed responsibility for the killing alleged that Finucane was \"killed as an IRA officer and not as a solicitor.\" In recent months, it has become clear that the RUC may well have more to reveal about the killing. William Stobie was arrested last year and charged with the killing, although, last week, the charges against him were reduced to \"aiding and abetting\" the shooting. In 1989, Stobie was quartermaster of the West Belfast UDA. We now know that he was also an RUC Special Branch informant. In the Sunday Tribune newspaper, he claimed that his RUC handlers had been tipped-off that Finucane was the target. Then, on the day of the killing itself, Stobie contacted his handlers and informed them that he had supplied weapons for a killing that would take place later that day. Over the years a momentum has built up, backing the calls of Geraldine Finucane for an independent judicial inquiry into the killing of her husband. The call has been supported by human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and the New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. The UN Human Rights Commission joined the chorus after a scathing report on the killing was compiled by leading Malaysian jurist Param Cumaraswamy, who concluded his report by writing \"so long as this murder is unresolved, many in the community will continue to lack confidence in the ability of the government to dispense justice in a fair and equitable manner.\" Last year, again on Panorama, Cumaraswamy claimed that the present RUC Chief Constable Sir Ronnie Flanagan told him that there were lawyers who were involved with paramilitary organisations. At first, Flanagan denied the allegation, but was publicly embarrassed when the BBC programme showed him minutes of his meeting with Cumaraswamy that Flanagan's office had subsequently approved and that showed such a conversation had taken place. Within months of the conversation between Cumaraswamy and Flanagan, an event occurred which made the Finucane allegations suddenly very relevant. Another leading nationalist solicitor was assassinated, again after receiving alleged threats from the security forces. Indeed, in an added, the week before Rosemary Nelson was blown up outside her home in Lurgan, a newspaper advertisement appeared calling for an independent inquiry into the Finucane shooting, signed by over 400 Irish and international legal figures. Soon after the then Secretary of State Mo Mowlam met with Geraldine Finucane, and received \"new evidence,\" which Finucane's widow believes are grounds for a new inquiry. Since then, she has met and received the backing of the Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern. If today she convinces Tony Blair that there are grounds for a full inquiry, on top of the re-opened criminal investigation which saw Stobie's arrest last year and was headed by the recently appointed head of the Metropolitan Police John Stevens, it could open an almighty can of worms. The following questions are some that require convincing answers. How did Douglas Hogg feel secure in making his comments to the House of Commons three weeks before Finucane's assassination? Is it true, as claimed, that Hogg was briefed by RUC Special Branch officers days before his Commons statement? Why did army intelligence not act on the warnings by Brian Nelson that Finucane's life was in danger? Why did RUC Special Branch not act on similar warnings from William Stobie? Were UFF/UDA suspects told that people like Finucane should be targeted rather than the random Catholics who made up the bulk of loyalist victims during the murder campaign of the time? What did MI5 know? If the intelligence services were informed, how high did this information go? The go-ahead for the killing of three IRA members in Gibraltar the previous year went as far as the prime minister's office. Is it possible that intelligence reports from different agencies of the security forces stopped at a very low level in Northern Ireland? Finally, if another solicitor could die in similarly suspicious circumstances almost exactly 10 years later, what does that say about how certain figures at the heart of the security establishment regard defence solicitors who happen to be good at their jobs?",

      "body": "<p> \"I 'm a Sinatra man,\" says Michael Parkinson proudly when I ask him how he felt interviewing Victoria Beckham. He is explaining that he doesn't necessarily have a large stockpile of Spice Girls records, and that, frankly, he doesn't care. Parky is at that happy age where he doesn't have to fret about appearing fashionable. </p> <p>A quick look at the guest list for his new chat show series, starting on Friday, emphasises the point: Andrew Lloyd Webber, Julie Walters, Mark Knopfler, Mike Reid, Robson Green. People with a bit of hinterland, and with in some cases a past that might be brighter than their present. Fame is fickle, but Parkinson's admiration isn't. </p> <p>\"I don't like people who, in my judgment, are chancers,\" says Parkinson. \"I have to think that the reason a guest is on the show is that he's bloody good at what he does. My attitude towards people coming on the show is not 'Do I like them?' but 'Do I admire them?' \" </p> <p>I meet Parkinson at a favourite restaurant of his in Mayfair - quiet, friendly, dignified and ever so slightly old world. My opening line is the predictable one - my terror at interviewing the supreme interviewer. \"That's bollocks,\" he says. \"I'm not bad at what I do. But it's a certain area of interviewing. People tend to lump all interviewers together, but that's unfair. I can't do what Paxman does, or what Robin Day did. I'm not made that way.\" </p> <p>Parkinson once said his aim was to let his guests \"give the best of themselves to his audience\". A rather peculiar aim, I suggest. Shouldn't he be trying to find out what makes them tick, expose the private person behind the public face? \"The people I interview are not war criminals,\" he says. \"The only thing they've ever done, generally speaking, is entertain people. What's interesting is to find out why and how. </p> <p>\"A situation has developed where an interview isn't an interview unless there's blood on the carpet. I'd make a fool of myself if I tried to do that, and I don't see why the people who sit opposite me deserve that kind of treatment. The thing that I was most afraid of coming back was that that particular aspect of television had changed and that my show might seem very old-fashioned. It might look that way still, but the fact of the matter is there was an audience who wanted that.\" </p> <p>What Parkinson calls his \"second coming\" occurred in 1998, when - older, wiser and a good deal greyer - he returned to BBC1 16 years after his original, much-loved, much-feted chat show ended. It was, as he admits, a huge risk. \"I would have hated to come back and do a bad show that was badly received and made me skulk away thinking, 'Christ, I wish I'd never done that.' It was nice to come back and do a good show. That's what pleases me professionally. Reactions have been better than I could ever have imagined.\" </p> <p>It was typical of Parkinson that, despite 16 years away, nothing much had changed: the furniture looked the same; the stairs were still there; even the Harry Stoneham Five, whose music had seemed dated back in the early 80s, were still swinging. Only the guests were different, because the generation of Hollywood stars he had brilliantly caught at the end of their careers in the 70s were dying out. Cagney, Astaire, Crosby, Matthau, Niven - his cast list was remarkable and the resulting interviews legendary. </p> <p>Parkinson, who is now 65, recognises that the old order has changed. \"That great swathe of Hollywood film stars who were brought up through the studio system has gone, and they've not been replaced because what created them has gone as well. They'd also been through a war, those men and women, so they had a dimension which is more than being an actor; they weren't as blown away by their fame as some are today. The other thing that has changed is the power of the agent: there is far more undergrowth to get through.\" </p> <p>But he rejects the argument that there are no decent guests any more, and cites Paul McCartney (\"I'd been chasing him for 25 years\") and Woody Allen (\"I admire him inordinately\") as examples of recent interviewees who could be mentioned in the same breath as some of the ancients. </p> <p>But Ali, there'll never be another Ali, I say weepily. Parkinson becomes animated. \"Tiger Woods, he's Ali isn't he? In my lifetime I've seen two of the greatest ever superstars in sport: Ali was the first; this guy is the second. He's sensational. I'd love to do him.\" </p> <p>I had assumed that the guests for the entire series were already mapped out, but Parkinson and his team keep it flexible and like to strike the moment. \"We don't plan that far ahead. We've got enough to do the first three or four shows. It's not so much a question of getting one guest; it's a question of fitting three guests into a show. That's the fascination of the job. Any silly bugger can book one person and just stick two other people with them. The trick is to think about the combination. The difference between my show and others is that we have that conversational arena - three people who have to talk or we all look like idiots.\" </p> <p>The show is recorded the night before transmission and is only lightly edited. \"I shoot to time. I'm very old-fashioned about things like that because that's the background I came up in. I started in live television, so I just do it as live. I believe that if you over-record, it shows. The continuity is difficult: people age before your eyes. It's sloppy, awful.\" </p> <p>But there must be times when it goes wrong, when guests dry up or give monosyllabic answers and you are left babbling into endless silences? \"It's up to you to make it work. It doesn't not work too often, and it will only happen for two reasons - they're pissed or they're frightened. There's no cure for the former condition, as I know to my cost, but with the latter you can settle people down and take a bit longer to get them going. Then subtly edit: those will be the times that we go over, when the person doesn't respond immediately. And if it doesn't work at all, you have to be fatalistic about it - you can't win them all.\" </p> <p>Doesn't he sometimes wish he could entertain less and probe more? \"It's not In the Psychiatrist's Chair, but there's more than one way of skinning a rabbit. Once in an interview you have the person opposite you - in a totally phoney situation, which is television - trusting you. Then you can ask them anything you want. I asked Woody Allen about marrying his step-daughter, which was a fair question. It was a legitimate line of enquiry. He objected to it and said I was being voyeuristic, but I said no I'm not, this has had an effect on your career. I wasn't the slightest bit embarrassed by it, but I would have been if there hadn't been a point to it. It did affect his career - in Middle America it had an effect - and it was a legitimate question to ask.\" </p> <p>Parkinson admires his guests, is perhaps occasionally in awe of them, but he is never intimidated by them. \"I'm the boss, not them. It's my patch, not theirs. This is my home. That's why we never take the show on the road. They've got to come down my stairs into my living room and talk to me.\" </p> <p>He abandoned that cosy living room for the harsh commercial world in 1982, when he and fellow broadcasting luminaries David Frost, Anna Ford, Angela Rippon and Robert Kee set up TV-am. They won the ITV morning franchise, but then lost control of the company in a bitter boardroom battle. \"We did the difficult thing against the strongest group of bidders there has ever been,\" he says, \"but then we lost the bloody thing.\" </p> <p>Parkinson then did Desert Island Discs for 18 months, but had a well-publicised falling out with Roy Plomley's widow and left the programme. \"Mrs Plomley decided that I was a rough country boy with a terrible accent who shouldn't be allowed anyway near her husband's programme,\" he says with undisguised bitterness. </p> <p> It was not a happy period for Parkinson, compounded by the fact that he started drinking heavily, but he emphasises that he never stopped working - or earning. \"I was treading water but I didn't go under. I kept on working. I did lots of jobs, some of which I'm not particularly pleased to see on my CV, but on the other hand I'm delighted that I kept working. The most profitable year I had was two years after I'd left the BBC and TV-am, and nobody knew I was even on television. I was doing all kinds of crap, but it was highly paid crap, and I was rather proud of that.\" </p> <p>For all that, he certainly wasn't happy - and the drinking was an expression of his disillusionment. \"It was a phase I went through and I can look back at it now and see all the reasons why it happened - TV-am had gone, mid-life crisis, all that crap.\" He still likes a drink but it is now firmly under control. \"I couldn't work like I do now if I was drinking too much.\" </p> <p>Parkinson is known principally for his TV work - not just his show but his high-profile anchorman roles. He was the only cool head amid the wreckage of the BBC's millennium coverage, and in a couple of weeks will pop up as host (the word fits him like a glove) of A Night of 1,000 Shows, a celebration of the 40th anniversary of BBC Television Centre. Yet he sees himself principally as a journalist - he writes a weekly sports column for the Daily Telegraph - and reckons that gives him a substance that today's generation of TV presenters lack. </p> <p>\"I've always been a print journalist and I could make a living as a print journalist, so I've never had that fear about what would happen if TV didn't come calling. That's terribly important. If they said tomorrow 'We never want to see your face on television again', it wouldn't matter a damn. I could still make a living and I'd probably write a book about how crazy they all were on TV, all my secrets. </p> <p>\"In the early days of TV, presenters were recruited from journalism: we'd had a life outside television and we brought to television an approach to whatever we did that was journalistic. Now anybody is a celebrity, anybody is a presenter. Where do they come from? What are they? They don't know themselves, poor buggers. They are put on by cynical producers and away they go. The tabloids pick them up and producers say 'What shall we do with them? I know, give them a talk show; it's easy, a talk show.' But it's not easy, as people have demonstrated for many years. Why is Boot Hill so full of these people?\" </p> <p>Parkinson is a survivor. His show has survived. His marriage, to teacher-turned-broadcaster Mary, has survived. His popularity has survived the shifts in public taste. He has never tried to change and probably wouldn't know how: he is a pretty unreconstructed northern male of a certain vintage who has no truck with political correctness and thinks Bernard Manning is uproariously funny. His attitudes seem out of place in our happy-clappy, all-inclusive, trans-gender times, yet he remains a star, the bedrock of the Beeb. How does he do it? </p> <p>\"I've always taken the view that you should keep on working. I've worked for every newspaper in the business; I've also worked for most television and radio stations. My view is don't be posh about it, keep working, because in the end things will work out. It's the Michael Caine view of film-making: there'll be a lot of rubbish but one or two things will remind you what you came into the business for. </p> <p>\"If you've got any sense, you are what you area: you're still the person from where you came. The great problem with celebrity is that it can change you, but fortunately it happened to me when I was a mature man. I was 35 and had had a career in Fleet Street and as a producer, so I understood what was happening. If it had happened to me when I was 21, I don't think you'd be interviewing me today.\"</p>",

Until then she will keep her place in the cabinet - though there may come a moment when she changes her mind on that too - and go on representing the people of Redcar. After that, she wants a life of her own. She also plans to devote her new freedom to campaigning on favourite issues like poverty and conflct resolution. It would not be surprising if many offers were made for her services now, some of them rather more lucrative than even the rewards of cabinet service. When Labour won the 1997 election, no one doubted that Mo had the talent to carry her into the cabinet. The decision that she should go to the Northern Ireland office was less expected but widely acclaimed as inspired. To pick a politician whose every sentence proclaimed she was human first and a politician afterwards was a masterstroke in terms of the peace process begun by John Major and continued by Tony Blair. Unionist politicians did not trust or even like her, believing that she was soft on republicans. But the ordinary people of Northern Ireland, of all persuasions, and women especially, turned out in force to bathe in the Mowlam effect, taking her to their hearts just as she took them to hers. People outside Northern Ireland savoured that too. Her popularity ratings soared. At a Labour party conference the very mention of Mo in Tony Blair's speech provoked a standing ovation. It was said that Blair did not like this, and that some of the reservations about Mo Mowlam, more and more voiced by some of her senior colleagues, were fired by that episode. The truth is more complicated. The potential problem with Mo had been there all along. Political leadership is a team affair, and senior ministers obviously out of tune - in style as much as on policy - tend to be a worry and an embarrassment. The very openeness, spilling into indiscretion, which made her a popular hero had colleagues biting their nails. What would she get up to next? Downing Street has always denied that a whispering campaign was launched against her, but whether out if calculation or pure impatience, wounding things were said. Julia Langdon's life of her, due next month, will make specific charges against some of those close to Tony Blair, and Dr Mowlam herself has more than once let slip her own suspicions. She is also, to an extent which is sometimes underestimated because of the informal, spontaneous way she behaves, an ambitious person. If she had to be moved from the Northern Ireland office, she would have expected something meatier, more susceptible to her popular magic, than the role of cabinet enforcer she has now. She might have liked a great department like health, where the popular touch could have made her some kind of political Florence Nightingale, saviour and friend of the sick - though her talent for administration might have been tested to destruction. It is even said that she had her eye on the foreign office, a prospect that, had it ever come close to achievement, would have brought something close to panic in the world of diplomacy. As a political force, Mo Mowlam is far from finished. The reaction to the Langdon book, the way she is received at conference, what she has to say in her own promised memoirs - all these will be feared by colleagues who like their politics neat and tidy and disciplined. All of this could provoke a backlash in favour of her style of politics, and against theirs. There is also here the loss of one of Labour's most senior and successful women. And this at a time when restiveness is breaking out at the party's neglect of women - from the offers to them of senior office down to their steady rejection at grassroots level as candidates are chosen for the coming election. Fortunately for Labour, their rivals will hardly be able to exploit that feeling since their own records are very much worse. But a good many women both among Labour actvists and less committed supporters will shake their heads over Mo's decision to go. If her face didn't fit, they will say, that tells you less about her than it does about those (almost all of them men) who made that judgment.

At BBH, they have also created ads for Olivio and Golden Wonder. They attribute their success to long hours, hard work and a love of comedy. \"We are influenced by life experiences and anything that makes us laugh,\" Southgate says.",

Last year, the millionth one rolled out of the factory in Sunderland. But there's no denying that it's showing its age. Even with a little cosmetic surgery, this is definitely last decade's model.

It turns right when I want it to, effortlessly and power-assisted. The gears are crisp and easy. There's all that vision I mentioned earlier - absolutely nothing evades my attention.

Tall and narrow with big windows - quite modern-looking back in 1993 when it first appeared on our streets. But not any more. It's more like a kid's drawing of a car than a real car now. The new Nissan Micra is, in fact, the old Nissan Micra with a bit of a facelift. There will be a properly new one in 2002.

      "body": "<p>Peter Salmon confessed to friends last week that he'd had a \"terrible Edinburgh\". Even before the annual television industry love-in, the BBC1 controller knew that his time was up. Nothing was said publicly, but it did not take everyone else long to work it out for themselves. </p> <p>The evidence was all there. First, in his MacTaggart lecture, director-general Greg Dyke laid into BBC1, saying it simply had to do better. Then, the following day, he attacked the use of soap stars in poor TV dramas (think Harbour Lights and Sunburn) and called time on tired old docusoaps. Next, it was his trusted lieutenant Mark Thompson, and not Salmon, who fielded questions about how BBC1 would take shape after the Nine O'Clock News is moved to 10pm. Finally, Salmon pulled out of a seminar on TV drama, at which he was to be a panelist. </p> <p>Whispers soon made it into print: both the Daily Mail and the Guardian ran stories saying Salmon's reign was over. There were no denials from the BBC, and the controller hurried back from a brief post-festival Scottish tour - he had gone to check out filming of Monarch of the Glen and Castaway - for a series of meetings with his bosses in London. It is not a question of if, but when - and it is certain that he'll be off to another top BBC job before the month is out. </p> <p>Whoever succeeds Salmon as head of the prime public service channel on British television will be taking on a task that will either be the pinnacle of their career, or turn them into a nervous wreck. </p> <p>The controller of BBC1 has the hardest task in television: balancing the BBC's public service obligation with the drive for high ratings. Some would argue that without a mass-appeal channel, the justification for the licence fee goes out of the window and the future of the entire organisation as it is currently constituted is undermined. </p> <p>It's not a new phenomenon: Bill Cotton, the legendary former managing director of BBC Television and BBC1 controller between 1977 and 1981, says it was ever thus. \"BBC1 has always been a vital part of the BBC's claim to a licence fee. One liked to think it was the quintessential part of the BBC, that tried to do the best of everything for everybody.\" The only difference is that for Cotton, there was only one enemy - ITV - now, in the digital age, there are dozens. </p> <p>Jonathan Powell, BBC1 controller between 1987 and 1992 and now head of drama at Carlton, agrees. \"You live and die by the ratings. That's what every controller of BBC1 has always known.\" It is an almost impossible task, carrying the torch for public service broadcasting while attempting to avoid being walked all over by the opposition, he says. \"That's why it's so difficult.\" </p> <p>Dyke's task is to arrest the decline at BBC1 and boost its share in relation to its main rivals. Indeed, some suggest privately that, at the end of his term, Dyke wants to be able to claim that BBC1 is more popular than ITV. If he achieves this aim, he will be credited as the saviour of the corporation. </p> <p>The standard Salmon defence is that he has done a \"fantastic job at the most difficult time\". There was no money available to invest in popular drama, the broadcast and production divisions were split, leaving him without a support structure, and yet he pulled off successes like Walking With Dinosaurs, Warriors and the Royle Family. He saw off Noel Edmonds, became the first BBC1 controller forced to schedule against the FA Cup, and with new investment has laid the foundations for his successor. </p> <p>The case for the prosecution is that Dinosaurs wasn't his commission, Warriors was a one-off, and the Royle Family can hardly be claimed by the BBC, since it is made by Granada. On top of that, there is no new returning drama to speak of. Casualty and EastEnders were all on the scene before he came along, Holby City was already in the pipeline and the jury is still out on Monarch of the Glen. </p> <p>\"You can't say it's all Salmon's fault. John Birt has a lot to answer for,\" says Powell. \"Nobody would have succeeded under John Birt's regime. He was responsible for reducing costs so far that people had nowhere to go. That's why Peter was forced into relying on documentary soaps, they were cheap and they were the only thing he could do.\" </p> <p>Michael Jackson, chief executive of Channel 4 and BBC1 controller between 1996 and 1997, agrees it was hard for Salmon. \"The BBC collectively asked him to be distinctive, and at the same time get a 30% share. That was impossible.\" </p> <p>But could he have succeeded had the dead hand of Birt not lingered above? The Salmon regime is littered with battles he should have won, but which he lost. When the BBC was agonising over the relaunch of the Six O'Clock News, Salmon wanted Jill Dando to anchor it. He was right: she was by far the most popular BBC presenter. But Tony Hall, the head of news, preferred political correspondent Huw Edwards, and Salmon lost. He wanted rid of Panorama: it's still there, a black hole in his weekly schedule. He wanted \u00a3100m more to invest in popular drama: he's got it now, but he's not going to be spending it. </p> <p>Despite her lack of drama experience, the cheques will almost certainly be signed off by Lorraine Heggessey - currently joint director of factual and learning - as long as the unfeasibly complex drama commissioning structure proposed by Thompson is sorted out. As Cotton says when asked how he ensured the return of dozens of popular series: \"You had a good head of drama and that was his job.\" </p> <p>At the moment, the BBC doesn't really have a head of drama. There's Jane Tranter, head of drama serials, and Mal Young, head of drama series. They are the Upstairs, Downstairs of BBC drama - she muses over Wives and Daughters and Other People's Children, while he gets his hands dirty with Casualty and Holby City. Soon there will be Simon Lewis and Sue Hogg from Granada, installed as executive producers in a new unit reporting to drama and entertainment supremo Alan Yentob. </p> <p>But are these really the right people? Lewis and Hogg were unpopular figures at Granada. It is understood that Granada's programming director Grant Mansfield got so fed up with their prevarication that he told them both to \"shove off\" to the BBC if they really wanted to. Granada is now looking forward to restructuring its drama department without them. </p> <p>Crucially, ITV's revered drama controller Nick Elliott doesn't seem to be in too much of a hurry to give up his network centre kingdom, despite desperate attempts by the BBC to get him. </p> <p>Meanwhile, it is clear that the lion's share of the \u00a395m of new money earmarked by Dyke for BBC1 is going on popular drama. At BBC Elstree this week, 30 new episodes of Holby City, the Casualty spin-off, are in production. That's twice last year's run, and takes it to Peak Practice proportions, becoming almost a year-round feature of our screens. The show will gain a new children's ward, allowing writers to diversify from heart surgery to saving babies (remember the audience demographics: at 8pm, it's mums, teens and kids after EastEnders). </p> <p>Talking of which, the soap has just introduced a new family to the Square, whose five mouthy daughters will provide a raft of new storylines. That long-promised fourth episode is now certain, and if the BBC has any sense it will play it on Sunday nights, its weak point, giving Heartbeat a serious run for its money and teeing up the audience for the later-night offerings. And in Birmingham, producers are labouring on an order for 100 new half-hours of Doctors, the successful daytime soap set in a Midlands surgery. </p> <p>Series such as Holby are what the BBC really needs, the fresh but reliable mid-week regular drama that ITV is best at. As Dyke said in his MacTaggart: \"It's the programmes, stupid\". </p> <p>Young, perched in a hospital chair on the Holby set, underscores its significance. This is the first successful new BBC1 one-hour drama format and it has risen above the very public failures of Harbour Lights and Sunburn - slapped down by Dyke in Edinburgh for relying on ex-soap stars. The man who once vowed he would use former soap stars above all others is repentant. \"We're all guilty of grabbing a face, but it's a short-term gimmick. Viewers see right through it. It's the scripts that count. On the other hand, the soaps are so prevalent it's hard to find someone who hasn't been in one,\" says Young equably. </p> <p>Salmon remarked at Edinburgh, perhaps prophetically, that BBC1 can be a very cold place. He meant that there would have to be more collaboration, between the network of five new channels sketched out by Dyke, so promising ideas can migrate across. </p> <p> However, in the short term, the stockpiling for next year's schedule blitz started under him six months ago, as the shift in 9pm news was anticipated. The build up in production has been aided, confirms Dyke, by a cache of \u00a3200m, amassed by prudent BBC accountants, before the improved licence fee settlement was struck last January. </p> <p>So, there are three more Scarlet Pimpernels, starring Richard E Grant. Martin Shaw, a hit in ITV's rival hospital drama, Always and Everyone, has been wooed to star in Judge John Dee, a series about an unconventional judge, written by GF Newman (Law and Order). And Stephen Tompkinson is being paired with Nick Berry for In Deep, an undercover cop show, for post watershed. It could become the regular police drama that the BBC so badly needs. </p> <p>BBC1 is investing in Steven Spielberg's 10-part Band of Brothers, about a group of American soldiers in the second world war, a spin-off from Saving Private Ryan, currently in production in Hertfordshire. </p> <p>It's clear, then, that Dyke has signed up BBC1 to the Bill Cotton rule of \"being the best of everyone for everybody\". The question is, whether he's got the right idea. Is there enough talent simply to make all these programmes? Jackson thinks not. \"That's a huge undertaking and it's a waste of time. You just need to make sure that BBC1 is out there, making a few big hits that make people say 'thank God for the BBC'. Anything else is just too difficult.\" </p> <p><strong>ITV is in trouble too</strong><br>by David Elstein</p> <p>Why does it matter where the BBC places its main evening news bulletin? Before Greg Dyke labels me as one of the \"retired old men of the BBC\" defending yesterday (yes, I did work there until 35 years ago), I do not believe 9pm is sacrosanct or 10pm impermissible. But I do believe in being honest with the public. </p> <p>The argument based on Commons votes or US markets closing is simply laughable. Dyke himself scoffed at it while making the case for moving News at Ten to Gerald Kaufman's Commons committee when he was ITV's council chairman. Very few Commons votes feature in the news, let alone those at 10pm. The US markets have all but closed when the present 9pm bulletin ends, and virtually never merit more than a glancing mention. </p> <p>But \"the main reason\" for the move, according to Dyke, is that more people will watch news in the later slot. That is barely credible. There are far fewer people available to view television at 10pm than 9pm. A later bulletin might - \"might!\" - just win a larger share of available viewers, but that \"more people will watch it\" is a pledge almost impossible to fulfil. Will the governors require a return to 9pm if the ploy fails? Don't hold your breath. </p> <p>Dyke made much of the claim that \"currently in digital homes, audience share for the Nine O'Clock News often falls below 10%\". In fact, after under-performing against the rest of the schedule for the first six months of the year in digital satellite homes, the Nine O'Clock News has since equalled or out-performed BBC1 as a whole in these homes, based on the relative share of viewing compared with total viewing. </p> <p>In any case, there is absolutely no evidence that news will perform any better relatively in digital homes at 10pm than at 9pm. And we have heard before all these improbable protestations about enlarging the news audience by moving the bulletin later - from the ITV companies. Nobody (except, perhaps, an over-credulous ITC) believed them: but then the transparent motive for the move was to increase audience share in the vacated slot. </p> <p>Increasing BBC1's audience share at 9pm is evidently the true motive for moving the news, and Greg should have been much more straightforward about it. After all, it is all part of the pressure that licence-fee funding places on the BBC. You cannot afford to let the audience share for your main channel drop to the point where licence-fee payers feel short-changed, and evasion starts to rise again. </p> <p>Of course, what takes the 9pm slot remains a crucial issue. First, will it drive up audience share? The evidence from the run of failed dramas at 9.30pm recently would suggest that the BBC simply lacks the fire power to compete at 9pm, unless there is to be a shift to much more populist programming. That in turn raises the issue of why a publicly-funded broadcaster should deliberately reduce the news audience in peak-time (as seems inevitable) in favour of increasing consumption of soft factual material or entertainment. A major dent in the BBC's reputation for public service broadcasting seems a high price to pay for putting a minor blip in the ratings decline of BBC1. </p> <p>Whether Lorraine Heggessey (if it is to be her) can achieve what eluded Peter Salmon must be doubtful. Three years of navigating the BBC's frustrating system seems to have crushed some of Salmon's natural flair: at Edinburgh, he made a woeful hash of the ITV line-up in the scheduling game, putting both a 90-minute Bill and Burnside into peak-time, while BBC exile Michael Attwell showed how a competitive BBC1 schedule could be assembled. Heggessey - whom I have known since she was a student - is an energetic go-getter, but she (like Salmon) will lack the full control of the channel budget and commissioning process that is so essential in a competitive environment. </p> <p>In any event, the downward trend for the two main channels seems inexorable. In 1989, ITV and BBC1 captured 80% of all viewers. In 1995, 70%. In 1999, just under 60%. So far this year, 56.5%. For the last month, less than 53%. In multi-channel homes in July, they shared barely 40% of the audience, for the first time less than all satellite channels combined. If anything, BBC1's plight has only served to conceal ITV's dismal performance, not just across the day, but even within its own carefully defined version of peak-time, where it will fail by a wide margin even to meet the target it so recently revised sharply downward. Of course, ITV's concentration of ownership allows it to secure a disproportionate amount of the advertising market, despite audience erosion. The licence fee is not like that. Dyke (and Heggessey) may find that the news manoeuvre backfires. A further audience decline, embracing an even sharper news audience decline, would leave a lot of questions to be answered at Edinburgh next year.</p>",

When the BBC was agonising over the relaunch of the Six O'Clock News, Salmon wanted Jill Dando to anchor it. He was right: she was by far the most popular BBC presenter. But Tony Hall, the head of news, preferred political correspondent Huw Edwards, and Salmon lost. He wanted rid of Panorama: it's still there, a black hole in his weekly schedule. He wanted \u00a3100m more to invest in popular drama: he's got it now, but he's not going to be spending it. Despite her lack of drama experience, the cheques will almost certainly be signed off by Lorraine Heggessey - currently joint director of factual and learning - as long as the unfeasibly complex drama commissioning structure proposed by Thompson is sorted out. As Cotton says when asked how he ensured the return of dozens of popular series: \"You had a good head of drama and that was his job.\" At the moment, the BBC doesn't really have a head of drama. There's Jane Tranter, head of drama serials, and Mal Young, head of drama series. They are the Upstairs, Downstairs of BBC drama - she muses over Wives and Daughters and Other People's Children, while he gets his hands dirty with Casualty and Holby City. Soon there will be Simon Lewis and Sue Hogg from Granada, installed as executive producers in a new unit reporting to drama and entertainment supremo Alan Yentob. But are these really the right people? Lewis and Hogg were unpopular figures at Granada. It is understood that Granada's programming director Grant Mansfield got so fed up with their prevarication that he told them both to \"shove off\" to the BBC if they really wanted to. Granada is now looking forward to restructuring its drama department without them. Crucially, ITV's revered drama controller Nick Elliott doesn't seem to be in too much of a hurry to give up his network centre kingdom, despite desperate attempts by the BBC to get him. Meanwhile, it is clear that the lion's share of the \u00a395m of new money earmarked by Dyke for BBC1 is going on popular drama. At BBC Elstree this week, 30 new episodes of Holby City, the Casualty spin-off, are in production. That's twice last year's run, and takes it to Peak Practice proportions, becoming almost a year-round feature of our screens. The show will gain a new children's ward, allowing writers to diversify from heart surgery to saving babies (remember the audience demographics: at 8pm, it's mums, teens and kids after EastEnders). Talking of which, the soap has just introduced a new family to the Square, whose five mouthy daughters will provide a raft of new storylines. That long-promised fourth episode is now certain, and if the BBC has any sense it will play it on Sunday nights, its weak point, giving Heartbeat a serious run for its money and teeing up the audience for the later-night offerings. And in Birmingham, producers are labouring on an order for 100 new half-hours of Doctors, the successful daytime soap set in a Midlands surgery. Series such as Holby are what the BBC really needs, the fresh but reliable mid-week regular drama that ITV is best at. As Dyke said in his MacTaggart: \"It's the programmes, stupid\". Young, perched in a hospital chair on the Holby set, underscores its significance. This is the first successful new BBC1 one-hour drama format and it has risen above the very public failures of Harbour Lights and Sunburn - slapped down by Dyke in Edinburgh for relying on ex-soap stars. The man who once vowed he would use former soap stars above all others is repentant. \"We're all guilty of grabbing a face, but it's a short-term gimmick. Viewers see right through it. It's the scripts that count. On the other hand, the soaps are so prevalent it's hard to find someone who hasn't been in one,\" says Young equably. Salmon remarked at Edinburgh, perhaps prophetically, that BBC1 can be a very cold place. He meant that there would have to be more collaboration, between the network of five new channels sketched out by Dyke, so promising ideas can migrate across. However, in the short term, the stockpiling for next year's schedule blitz started under him six months ago, as the shift in 9pm news was anticipated. The build up in production has been aided, confirms Dyke, by a cache of \u00a3200m, amassed by prudent BBC accountants, before the improved licence fee settlement was struck last January. So, there are three more Scarlet Pimpernels, starring Richard E Grant. Martin Shaw, a hit in ITV's rival hospital drama, Always and Everyone, has been wooed to star in Judge John Dee, a series about an unconventional judge, written by GF Newman (Law and Order). And Stephen Tompkinson is being paired with Nick Berry for In Deep, an undercover cop show, for post watershed. It could become the regular police drama that the BBC so badly needs. BBC1 is investing in Steven Spielberg's 10-part Band of Brothers, about a group of American soldiers in the second world war, a spin-off from Saving Private Ryan, currently in production in Hertfordshire. It's clear, then, that Dyke has signed up BBC1 to the Bill Cotton rule of \"being the best of everyone for everybody\". The question is, whether he's got the right idea. Is there enough talent simply to make all these programmes? Jackson thinks not. \"That's a huge undertaking and it's a waste of time. You just need to make sure that BBC1 is out there, making a few big hits that make people say 'thank God for the BBC'. Anything else is just too difficult.\" ITV is in trouble too by David Elstein Why does it matter where the BBC places its main evening news bulletin? Before Greg Dyke labels me as one of the \"retired old men of the BBC\" defending yesterday (yes, I did work there until 35 years ago), I do not believe 9pm is sacrosanct or 10pm impermissible. But I do believe in being honest with the public. The argument based on Commons votes or US markets closing is simply laughable. Dyke himself scoffed at it while making the case for moving News at Ten to Gerald Kaufman's Commons committee when he was ITV's council chairman. Very few Commons votes feature in the news, let alone those at 10pm. The US markets have all but closed when the present 9pm bulletin ends, and virtually never merit more than a glancing mention. But \"the main reason\" for the move, according to Dyke, is that more people will watch news in the later slot. That is barely credible. There are far fewer people available to view television at 10pm than 9pm. A later bulletin might - \"might!\" - just win a larger share of available viewers, but that \"more people will watch it\" is a pledge almost impossible to fulfil. Will the governors require a return to 9pm if the ploy fails? Don't hold your breath. Dyke made much of the claim that \"currently in digital homes, audience share for the Nine O'Clock News often falls below 10%\". In fact, after under-performing against the rest of the schedule for the first six months of the year in digital satellite homes, the Nine O'Clock News has since equalled or out-performed BBC1 as a whole in these homes, based on the relative share of viewing compared with total viewing. In any case, there is absolutely no evidence that news will perform any better relatively in digital homes at 10pm than at 9pm. And we have heard before all these improbable protestations about enlarging the news audience by moving the bulletin later - from the ITV companies. Nobody (except, perhaps, an over-credulous ITC) believed them: but then the transparent motive for the move was to increase audience share in the vacated slot. Increasing BBC1's audience share at 9pm is evidently the true motive for moving the news, and Greg should have been much more straightforward about it. After all, it is all part of the pressure that licence-fee funding places on the BBC. You cannot afford to let the audience share for your main channel drop to the point where licence-fee payers feel short-changed, and evasion starts to rise again. Of course, what takes the 9pm slot remains a crucial issue. First, will it drive up audience share? The evidence from the run of failed dramas at 9.30pm recently would suggest that the BBC simply lacks the fire power to compete at 9pm, unless there is to be a shift to much more populist programming. That in turn raises the issue of why a publicly-funded broadcaster should deliberately reduce the news audience in peak-time (as seems inevitable) in favour of increasing consumption of soft factual material or entertainment. A major dent in the BBC's reputation for public service broadcasting seems a high price to pay for putting a minor blip in the ratings decline of BBC1. Whether Lorraine Heggessey (if it is to be her) can achieve what eluded Peter Salmon must be doubtful. Three years of navigating the BBC's frustrating system seems to have crushed some of Salmon's natural flair: at Edinburgh, he made a woeful hash of the ITV line-up in the scheduling game, putting both a 90-minute Bill and Burnside into peak-time, while BBC exile Michael Attwell showed how a competitive BBC1 schedule could be assembled. Heggessey - whom I have known since she was a student - is an energetic go-getter, but she (like Salmon) will lack the full control of the channel budget and commissioning process that is so essential in a competitive environment. In any event, the downward trend for the two main channels seems inexorable. In 1989, ITV and BBC1 captured 80% of all viewers. In 1995, 70%. In 1999, just under 60%. So far this year, 56.5%. For the last month, less than 53%. In multi-channel homes in July, they shared barely 40% of the audience, for the first time less than all satellite channels combined. If anything, BBC1's plight has only served to conceal ITV's dismal performance, not just across the day, but even within its own carefully defined version of peak-time, where it will fail by a wide margin even to meet the target it so recently revised sharply downward. Of course, ITV's concentration of ownership allows it to secure a disproportionate amount of the advertising market, despite audience erosion. The licence fee is not like that. Dyke (and Heggessey) may find that the news manoeuvre backfires. A further audience decline, embracing an even sharper news audience decline, would leave a lot of questions to be answered at Edinburgh next year.",

      "bodyText": "Labour's ethical foreign policy, launched to a fanfare by Robin Cook, is to be dropped for the next general election, according to senior sources and internal party documents seen by the Guardian. The policy is said to have become \"a millstone\" around the neck of the foreign secretary, who announced it within days of Labour taking power in May 1997, saying it would \"make Britain once again a force for good in the world\". The 32-page final document from the party's national policy forum, which will form the basis of Labour's next election manifesto, fails to mention the ethical foreign policy or ethical dimension in its main report and recommendations. Called Britain in the World, it talks of promoting \"a more responsible arms trade\". It was finalised last month before news that a key part of the ethical foreign policy, a bill to regulate the arms trade, had failed to find time in the government's legislative programme. The document will be unveiled at the party's conference next month. It was drawn up by key Labour figures including Mr Cook, the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, and the international development secretary, Clare Short. This lays to rest a policy that delighted the party's left wing when it was announced but has troubled ministers and led to inter-departmental rows ever since. Labour's claims to the label of an ethical foreign policy were holed after they refused to block a string of arms sales to regimes with poor human rights records. Sources with knowledge of the discussions confirm that what one described as the \"cornerstone\" of Labour's foreign policy was dead before the document was even drawn up. On May 12 1997, Mr Cook said in a \"mission statement\" that it \"supplies an ethical content to foreign policy and recognises that the national interest cannot be defined only by narrow realpolitik\". A senior source with knowledge of the debate within the government said: \"It was an embarrassment as we couldn't live up to it. We were always being panned.\" The source added: \"The document is an accurate reflection of government thinking. \"I'm sure they'll [number 10] be pleased it's gone, otherwise it becomes a big benchmark everyone needs to follow.\" A source involved in the round table discussions that led to Britain in the World said that even before the final draft was written in July, ethical foreign policy had been killed off as a label the government would use: \"It did not form any part of our discussions. It was not surprising. It was understood that Robin Cook's view was that the whole thing has become a millstone.\" The document pledges tighter controls on small arms exports and to \"work to strengthen significantly the EU code of conduct on arms exports.\" The Foreign Office minister, Peter Hain, said: \"We want to be judged by our record not by obsessive interpretation of a misrepresented label. Our record is a proud one on human rights, on refusing to export arms which could be used for either internal repression or external aggression, and it is a record which is as night and day compared with the thoroughly unprincipled policy of the Tories. \"Our foreign policy stands up against any realistic yardstick on its commitment to human rights and international justice.\" Rachel Harford, of the pressure group Campaign Against the Arms Trade, said: \"To have made such gain in opposition from this issue, with the Scott inquiry [into arms to Iraq], and to come in with expectations raised with commitments to an ethical dimension when they first came in, it's absolutely scandalous.\" The national policy forum document will go to next month's Labour party conference, where the leadership hope it will be rubber stamped. It is expected to form the basis of the section in the party's election manifesto on foreign policy.",

      "bodyText": "Reuters, the venerable information group, is to offer pop music news and pictures to its online clients, alongside its usual blend of financial prices and corporate statements. City brokers, bored of staring at financial news pages, will soon be able to read exclusive interviews with pop bands like Spiller, led by Sophie Ellis-Baxter, who are helping to promote the new alliance, following the agreement with cross media music company Worldpop. The service, to be be updated twice a day, will include pop scoops, reviews, gossip and chart news. Reuters will not restrict access to its City clients. It is trying to expand the demographics of its user base. Worldpop targets 15-24 year-olds who, according to MORI research, make up one quarter of web users. Geoffrey Wheating, director of strategy, Reuters Media UK &amp; Ireland, said: \"Worldpop are undoubtedly a leader in reporting on the pop scene. Their coverage perfectly compliments Reuters' extensive entertainment file and provides an additional news service to our clients.\" Reuters was founded in October 1851 by Paul Julius Reuter, a German-born immigrant who, from an office in the City, transmitted stock market quotations between London and Paris, via the new Calais-Dover cable. Today it is the world's largest international news and television agency, with almost 2,000 journalists, photographers and camera operators in 153 countries.",

He said that Dr Mowlam was expected to remain as a cabinet minister until the next election. Dr Mowlam met Mr Blair at No 10 briefly this morning to plan the announcement of her retirement and to tell him that her mind was made up. No 10 said that Dr Mowlam would make a statement this afternoon explaining her decision, that was said to be unrelated to the brain tumour she had battled against during her time as Northern Ireland Secretary. Rumours have been rife that Dr Mowlam has never really been happy since losing her Northern Ireland brief to Peter Mandelson. She has also been subjected to a constant sniping campaign, questioning her mastery of details in her various briefs. As minister for the Cabinet Office, Dr Mowlam was in the unenviable position of being a roving minister, trying to get her fellow ministers to cooperate on projects, but without wielding real clout. Earlier in the summer, she publicly anticipated a time when she was no longer part of the government and said she would like to promote integrated schools for Ulster. Although widely popular, Dr Mowlam regularly made waves for the government. She was slapped down earlier this year when she called for a wider debate on the future of the Royal Family, and her suggestions for a more liberal approach to drugs have also got her into trouble for deviating from the official party line.

Football365.com 6/10 http://football365.com While it has all the basic features - results, news etc * it pales into insignificance when compared to the Waparesult football service.

      "body": "<b>What are the latest proposals?</b> <br> Released to coincide with this week's UN's Millennium Summit, the report from Labour and the Liberal Democrats calls for a total overhaul of UN peacekeeping, including the creation of a staff college - possibly in Britain - to command and train UN peacekeeping operations in the world. The college would modernise and professionalise peacekeeping operations so troops can deploy rapidly and take action in clear cases of aggression. The report also said that the UN should require member states to provide quarterly assessments of the soldiers available for peacekeeping operations. <p><b>What are the chances of success for these ideas?</b><br> There have been numerous proposals to sharpen up peacekeeping operations over the years. In the early 1990s, Secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali wanted to set up a sort of UN standing army, but the US and other Security Council members disliked the idea as they thought it would give the secretary-general too much power. Sir Brian Urqhart, formerly a top UN official, suggested a UN force composed of volunteers, like a UN foreign legion, but his imaginative idea also gathered dust on the shelves. More recently there have been less ambitious ideas from countries like Britain and Canada, which have suggested that countries set troops on standby for rapid deployment to hot spots. But ideas for reforms have made little headway. So past experience does not augur well for the latest plans. Expect grumbling at the idea of a special college being set up in the UK for a start.</p> <p><b>How has the UN performed in recent operations?</b><br> The UN has hardly covered itself in glory. In Sierra Leone, some 500 poorly-trained peacekeers were taken hostage by the Revolutionary United Front rebels without firing a shot. In other low points, the UN failed to intervene to stop the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 and, in one of its most shameful episodes, UN peacekeepers were helpless in stopping the slaughter of Bosnian Muslims by Serbs in Srebrenica - a so-called UN safe haven - in 1995. Currently, just 32 officers at UN headquarters oversee some 27,000 UN troops from 20 countries in 14 peacekeeping operations scattered across the globe.</p> <p><b>What has been the UN's record overall?</b><br> The record is mixed. Since 1947, two years after its formation, the UN has mounted some 50 peacekeeping and monitoring operations. Some 750,000 soldiers have put on its blue helmets and berets, from Central America to East Timor. There are some 14,000 soldiers, police, and other civilian back-up personnel taking part in UN operations around the world. Wars and other conflicts continue to rage.</p> <p><b>Surely there have been some successes?</b><br> It depends how you measure success. The UN generally intervenes not to end conflict but to restore stability after the fighting has ended. It has helped maintain an uneasy peace in places like Cyprus and the Golan Heights, and it has played a key part in the restoration of order in other places, like East Timor and Cambodia. It has also played an honourable part in initiatives like de-mining, and monitoring potential trouble spots. But for the most part its acronym-laden contingents - like the 22-year-old UNIFIL force in south Lebanon - have proved powerless to prevent new outbreaks of fighting.</p> <p><b>How much does all this cost?</b><br> The UN is spending about \u00a32.2bn a year on peacekeeping and related projects. There are perennial rows with member states over funding, and the organisation says it is owed some \u00a3750m for past and current operations. Typically, the UN secretary-general has to scramble for troops from countries willing to contribute once the Security Council gives its blessing to a mission. Poorer countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh have been more than willing to put up troops, because UN rates of pay can be quite good. But the system does not mean that the best qualified troops are always available.</p> <p><b>Is there competition in the international peacekeeping sector?</b><br> The Nato intervention in Kosovo is the alliance's first active operation in its 51-year history. With the Balkans in a continuing state of ethnic and economic turmoil, it may not be the last. Then there is the Western European Union: a perpetual fledgling among the international military alliances, but one which has, at least theoretically, the capacity to assemble a peacekeeping force. The real competition comes from individual countries with the capacity to protect their interests - and impose their will. Classic examples are the no-fly 'secure' zones in north and south Iraq, patrolled by US warplanes with the help of the RAF.</p> <p><b>So the US would prefer to go it alone?</b><br> Far from it. The State Department argues that the UN can perform valuable service in protecting the interests of America, as the world's dominant military and economic power, without exposing US servicemen and women to peril. And US diplomats are regularly embarrassed by congressional calls for the UN to recompense Washington for what are, in reality, unilateral operations.</p> <p><b>Useful links:</b><br></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/\">Foreign Office</a><br></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/\">Liberal Democrats</a><br></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/Kosovo\">Kosovo special report</a><br></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/\">UN peacekeeping operations </a><br></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.clw.org/pub/clw/un/annan2-23.html\">Kofi Annan (UN Secretary General) on peacekeeping</a><br></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.clw.org/pub/clw/un/pkexpend.html\">UN peacekeeping costs</a><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.clw.org/pub/clw/un/pkbudget00.html\">US contribution</a><br></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/www/issues/fs-un_peace_costs_980605.html\">Who pays for US forces</a><br></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/www/issues/peacesup.html\">The UN serving US interests</a><br></p> <p> <a href=\"http://peacekeeper.kosone.com/pk1a.html\">Canada's role in peacekeeping</a><br></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.nato.int\">Nato</a><br></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.weu.int/eng/index.html\">Western European Union</a><br></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.janes.com\">Janes Defence site</a><br></p>",

In other low points, the UN failed to intervene to stop the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 and, in one of its most shameful episodes, UN peacekeepers were helpless in stopping the slaughter of Bosnian Muslims by Serbs in Srebrenica - a so-called UN safe haven - in 1995. Currently, just 32 officers at UN headquarters oversee some 27,000 UN troops from 20 countries in 14 peacekeeping operations scattered across the globe. What has been the UN's record overall? The record is mixed. Since 1947, two years after its formation, the UN has mounted some 50 peacekeeping and monitoring operations. Some 750,000 soldiers have put on its blue helmets and berets, from Central America to East Timor. There are some 14,000 soldiers, police, and other civilian back-up personnel taking part in UN operations around the world. Wars and other conflicts continue to rage. Surely there have been some successes? It depends how you measure success. The UN generally intervenes not to end conflict but to restore stability after the fighting has ended. It has helped maintain an uneasy peace in places like Cyprus and the Golan Heights, and it has played a key part in the restoration of order in other places, like East Timor and Cambodia. It has also played an honourable part in initiatives like de-mining, and monitoring potential trouble spots. But for the most part its acronym-laden contingents - like the 22-year-old UNIFIL force in south Lebanon - have proved powerless to prevent new outbreaks of fighting. How much does all this cost? The UN is spending about \u00a32.2bn a year on peacekeeping and related projects. There are perennial rows with member states over funding, and the organisation says it is owed some \u00a3750m for past and current operations. Typically, the UN secretary-general has to scramble for troops from countries willing to contribute once the Security Council gives its blessing to a mission. Poorer countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh have been more than willing to put up troops, because UN rates of pay can be quite good. But the system does not mean that the best qualified troops are always available. Is there competition in the international peacekeeping sector? The Nato intervention in Kosovo is the alliance's first active operation in its 51-year history. With the Balkans in a continuing state of ethnic and economic turmoil, it may not be the last. Then there is the Western European Union: a perpetual fledgling among the international military alliances, but one which has, at least theoretically, the capacity to assemble a peacekeeping force. The real competition comes from individual countries with the capacity to protect their interests - and impose their will. Classic examples are the no-fly 'secure' zones in north and south Iraq, patrolled by US warplanes with the help of the RAF. So the US would prefer to go it alone? Far from it. The State Department argues that the UN can perform valuable service in protecting the interests of America, as the world's dominant military and economic power, without exposing US servicemen and women to peril. And US diplomats are regularly embarrassed by congressional calls for the UN to recompense Washington for what are, in reality, unilateral operations.

      "trailText": "<p>In the burgeoning market of personal digital assistants (PDAs), leading computer companies are having to work hard to stay ahead of the competition both in terms of price and technological advances, writes <strong>Amy Vickers</strong></p>",
      "byline": "Amy Vickers",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>What's a PDA?</strong></p> <p>The term PDA, or personal digital assistant, was coined by John Sculley, former CEO of Apple Computers, back in 1992. Until recently, PDAs were nothing more than electronic versions of filofaxes, comprising calendars and address books with tiny keyboards and murky LCD displays. The arrival of the PalmPilot in 1996, a handheld device with an elegant user interface and a character-recognition system that actually worked, changed all this. Palm computers were a runaway success, catapulting the company into the lead in the handheld PC market with around 70-80% market share, strides ahead of its nearest competitor, Microsoft PocketPC.</p> <p>Other market competitors include Handspring, set up two years ago by the brains behind the PalmPilot, and a strong component of cheap, basic PDAs for the mass market.</p> <p>Handspring's entry price - \u00a3150-\u00a3199 - has sent tremors though Palm Computing, whose lowest entry point before its Handspring clone (the Palm m100) was in excess of \u00a3200. Market newcomer Handspring has proved a point or two with its low-priced Visor, which cleverly targeted the youth market and won, and now commands roughly a quarter of the US PDA market. The reason for its popularity is simple: it was built for add-ons, such as an MP3 player, a webcam and a digital camera - all can simply be slotted into its Springboard expansion slot. </p> <p>Other major manufacturers in the PDA arena include Casio, Compaq, Hewlett Packard and Psion. </p> <p><strong>Different devices</strong></p> <p>There are basically three major lines of PDAs: those with a Palm operating system (OS), those with a Windows operating system and Psion devices. Palm Computing, a division of 3Com, is the market leader:</p> <p><strong>Palm Computing</strong></p> <p>While the new PocketPCs contain everything but the kitchen sink, the Palm devices have the edge in simplicity. If you don't want to use the devices for listening to music, browsing the internet, or working in documents that can be easily transferred to a computer, then you may be better off with a Palm or Handspring device, particularly if all you want to do is traditional PDA functions (calendar, contact and to-do list). </p> <p>Palm Computing's long-term strategy is to concentrate its efforts on licensing handheld operating systems, making products and services for wireless internet services, portal sites and Palm-branded devices. </p> <p>Palm's flagship product is the Palm IIIc, the only colour handheld it produces, which is priced at \u00a3349. Even though this offers more functionality than other Palms on the market, such as browsing the internet and a full screen agenda view, it still only has 8MB of memory. The other popular Palm device is the Palm Vx which has an ultra-slim design that really does live up to its pocket size claims. </p> <p>With all Palm devices, the user has to learn the shorthand-style alphabet, called Graffiti, which is fairly tedious but worth the hassle. PocketPCs on the other hand have a transcriber function that automatically recognises most handwriting and types it into a Word document. Perhaps the biggest benefit Palm has over PocketPCs though, is that it can synch with both Macintosh computers and PCs, whereas PocketPCs only work in tandem with PC devices (ie Microsoft operating systems). </p> <p><strong>PocketPC</strong></p> <p>Recognising that computing is not necessarily going to be done at a fixed desk PC in the future, PocketPC is Microsoft's bid not to be excluded from any computing-related developments in the mobile market. Not only does PocketPC allow Microsoft to extend its Windows operating system to handheld and smaller devices, it also allows Microsoft to wrestle a share of the market from Palm Computing, which currently enjoys around 80% market share in the PDA market.</p> <p>Microsoft designed the Windows CE operating system for small devices and has licensed it to a number of manufacturers, including HP, Compaq, Casio, and Symbol who make the Pocket PC devices. </p> <p>The latest generation of PocketPCs have been built to impress, and more profoundly, keep Palm on its toes. The devices are essentially mini powerful computers that have many of the applications and multimedia capabilities of the average PC. Best of all, the miniature versions of Microsoft Office applications (word, excel, outlook express) means greater synchronisation between the PDA and the desktop computer. Another advantage PocketPCs have over Palm devices is their expansion capabilities that enable a greater range of accessories to be added onto the devices (digital cameras, GPRS). </p> <p>In terms of look and feel, the new generation of PocketPCs are smaller and have evolved to look more like Palm devices. Given the memory capabilities (16MB as opposed to Palm's 8MB) and colour screen, PocketPCs are still heavier than Palms and Psions, but then the fact that the PocketPC offers so many more services than other PDAs, this is not necessarily such a cumbersome drawback. </p> <p>Other services offered by a PocketPC over the other PDAs include digital image viewing, a voice recorder, games, an internet browser, MP3 and Microsoft Player audio capabilities and a book reader for digital books. The most popular lines are the HP Jornada, priced at around \u00a3300, and the Compaq Ipaq, priced at around \u00a3330.</p> <p>At present, PocketPCs enjoy approximately 15% of the PDA market, and are expected to grab anything up to 40% of the market within three years. </p> <p><strong>Psion</strong> </p> <p>Homegrown firm, Psion, has a large percentage of the European market but has yet to make any inroads into the US market. Its Revo device (priced around \u00a3260) is its only device that qualifies as a palm-size device, and it is also the only one that contains a real keyboard. It runs on Psion's EPOC operating system, which is extremely fast. However, it is an unlit monochrome screen.</p> <p>The Psion 5MX, priced at \u00a3429, is really just a tiny PC that contains a word processor, spreadsheet, web browsing and emails, scheduling and contact lists.

      "bodyText": "What's a PDA? The term PDA, or personal digital assistant, was coined by John Sculley, former CEO of Apple Computers, back in 1992. Until recently, PDAs were nothing more than electronic versions of filofaxes, comprising calendars and address books with tiny keyboards and murky LCD displays. The arrival of the PalmPilot in 1996, a handheld device with an elegant user interface and a character-recognition system that actually worked, changed all this. Palm computers were a runaway success, catapulting the company into the lead in the handheld PC market with around 70-80% market share, strides ahead of its nearest competitor, Microsoft PocketPC. Other market competitors include Handspring, set up two years ago by the brains behind the PalmPilot, and a strong component of cheap, basic PDAs for the mass market. Handspring's entry price - \u00a3150-\u00a3199 - has sent tremors though Palm Computing, whose lowest entry point before its Handspring clone (the Palm m100) was in excess of \u00a3200. Market newcomer Handspring has proved a point or two with its low-priced Visor, which cleverly targeted the youth market and won, and now commands roughly a quarter of the US PDA market. The reason for its popularity is simple: it was built for add-ons, such as an MP3 player, a webcam and a digital camera - all can simply be slotted into its Springboard expansion slot. Other major manufacturers in the PDA arena include Casio, Compaq, Hewlett Packard and Psion. Different devices There are basically three major lines of PDAs: those with a Palm operating system (OS), those with a Windows operating system and Psion devices. Palm Computing, a division of 3Com, is the market leader: Palm Computing While the new PocketPCs contain everything but the kitchen sink, the Palm devices have the edge in simplicity. If you don't want to use the devices for listening to music, browsing the internet, or working in documents that can be easily transferred to a computer, then you may be better off with a Palm or Handspring device, particularly if all you want to do is traditional PDA functions (calendar, contact and to-do list). Palm Computing's long-term strategy is to concentrate its efforts on licensing handheld operating systems, making products and services for wireless internet services, portal sites and Palm-branded devices. Palm's flagship product is the Palm IIIc, the only colour handheld it produces, which is priced at \u00a3349. Even though this offers more functionality than other Palms on the market, such as browsing the internet and a full screen agenda view, it still only has 8MB of memory. The other popular Palm device is the Palm Vx which has an ultra-slim design that really does live up to its pocket size claims. With all Palm devices, the user has to learn the shorthand-style alphabet, called Graffiti, which is fairly tedious but worth the hassle. PocketPCs on the other hand have a transcriber function that automatically recognises most handwriting and types it into a Word document. Perhaps the biggest benefit Palm has over PocketPCs though, is that it can synch with both Macintosh computers and PCs, whereas PocketPCs only work in tandem with PC devices (ie Microsoft operating systems). PocketPC Recognising that computing is not necessarily going to be done at a fixed desk PC in the future, PocketPC is Microsoft's bid not to be excluded from any computing-related developments in the mobile market. Not only does PocketPC allow Microsoft to extend its Windows operating system to handheld and smaller devices, it also allows Microsoft to wrestle a share of the market from Palm Computing, which currently enjoys around 80% market share in the PDA market. Microsoft designed the Windows CE operating system for small devices and has licensed it to a number of manufacturers, including HP, Compaq, Casio, and Symbol who make the Pocket PC devices. The latest generation of PocketPCs have been built to impress, and more profoundly, keep Palm on its toes. The devices are essentially mini powerful computers that have many of the applications and multimedia capabilities of the average PC. Best of all, the miniature versions of Microsoft Office applications (word, excel, outlook express) means greater synchronisation between the PDA and the desktop computer. Another advantage PocketPCs have over Palm devices is their expansion capabilities that enable a greater range of accessories to be added onto the devices (digital cameras, GPRS). In terms of look and feel, the new generation of PocketPCs are smaller and have evolved to look more like Palm devices. Given the memory capabilities (16MB as opposed to Palm's 8MB) and colour screen, PocketPCs are still heavier than Palms and Psions, but then the fact that the PocketPC offers so many more services than other PDAs, this is not necessarily such a cumbersome drawback. Other services offered by a PocketPC over the other PDAs include digital image viewing, a voice recorder, games, an internet browser, MP3 and Microsoft Player audio capabilities and a book reader for digital books. The most popular lines are the HP Jornada, priced at around \u00a3300, and the Compaq Ipaq, priced at around \u00a3330. At present, PocketPCs enjoy approximately 15% of the PDA market, and are expected to grab anything up to 40% of the market within three years. Psion Homegrown firm, Psion, has a large percentage of the European market but has yet to make any inroads into the US market. Its Revo device (priced around \u00a3260) is its only device that qualifies as a palm-size device, and it is also the only one that contains a real keyboard. It runs on Psion's EPOC operating system, which is extremely fast. However, it is an unlit monochrome screen. The Psion 5MX, priced at \u00a3429, is really just a tiny PC that contains a word processor, spreadsheet, web browsing and emails, scheduling and contact lists. Like the Palm products, it can also be hooked up to a Mac, and is surprisingly easy to use. Internet browsing on PDA The closest thing the handheld market has to a standard for communications protocol and mark-up language is WAP (Wireless Access Protocol), and given the amount of momentum behind it, WAP looks as though it could become the mark-up language of the handheld world. However it could be a two horse race with some operators already pre-installing Microsoft HTML browsers alongside Wap browsers, and Wap being likened to Netscape at the start of the browser wars. Content for PDAs Talk to a PDA owner about downloading content onto the devices, and it's pretty much guaranteed that they'll tell you they synch their device with AvantGo.

The moment can even be timed exactly: 11.43am. That was when Brian Lara was yet again bewildered by Craig White (a sentence one could not have anticipated writing only a few weeks ago). The Sun has been running a Wisdenometer, similar to the swingometer used on pre-computer election nights. At that point, it crashed towards England with the crunching certainty of the moment Portillo lost or Labour gained Hove.</p> <p>The fourth day of the Test (and that's an unexpected form of words too these days) was a linking passage between the catharsis of Saturday and the expected triumph today. It was a day of ovations, after a summer of them. The biggest came in Curtly Ambrose's last over in Test match cricket. But it was nothing to do with Ambrose: he was just the feed as Mike Atherton reached his century. </p> <p>As the crowd erupted, Ambrose stood impassively. He produced two more unmemorable deliveries then moved, on tender legs, towards the outfield and then cricketing history. You could almost SEE him creak. What a way to go. </p> <p>Six and a half years ago in Port of Spain, Ambrose blew away the aspirations of Athers, the tyro England captain, with one of the most devastating bowling bursts of all time. England were out for 46 - and defeat was such an orphan that even the team manager, MJK Smith, failed to support Atherton at his mournful press conference. </p> <p>Now Ambrose, and Courtney Walsh with him, has had to learn the truth that eagles can't soar when they are surrounded by turkeys. When Atherton was last man out (a few minutes after we had looked up all the carried-bat stats) the West Indians let him have his moment. The fast bowlers held back. Then it was their turn. </p> <p>Ambrose says he will never play Test cricket again. There is limited pleasure in a forthcoming tour of Australia in which West Indies will regard avoiding a 5-0 whitewash as their prime objective. Walsh is carrying on, because he is that sort, and because the virgin, mist-shrouded peak of 500 Test wickets is only 17 away. </p> <p>But even he cannot expect to bowl in a major match here again. So they both had their moment in the September sunshine. Walsh grinned and waved; Ambrose was more sombre. But they punched each other's fists, embraced and squabbled for a second about who would go first: \"After you, Courtney.\" \"No, after you, Curtly.\" Walsh won that round, and sent Ambrose in. </p> <p>And that was that. If we are ever going to see a great West Indian fast bowler tormenting our brave boys again, it is not obvious who, when or how. The mysterious factory that produced them all is shuttered and silent. There was a time when the line seemed endless, and it infiltrated batsmen's nightmares like the row of Banquo's crowned descendants haunting Macbeth. In the 1980s, supply so far exceeded demand that such players as Sylvester Clarke, Wayne Daniel, Ezra Moseley and Winston Davis, who would all have passed 100 Tests for England, hardly got a game. </p> <p>For the last time, we saw Ambrose stamp the ground, then lope in threateningly like a mutant killer giraffe. To the end, he provided living proof that precision bombing from a great height is possible. Perhaps the RAF should engage him as a consultant. </p> <p>Andy Roberts was perhaps the most ferocious of all the West Indians; Malcolm Marshall the most technically perfect; Michael Holding the most artistic; Walsh the most durable. But to the very end Ambrose was the most infallibly unhittable of them all. He got no wicket yesterday and so the wicket of Marcus Trescothick on Saturday was when his mum's famous bell rang for the 405th and final time. </p> <p>He will be remembered with affection by his team-mates, a shudder by opponents and awe by all who saw him. But for a man with such expressive features, he was remarkably inscrutable. Courtney was courtly; to strangers - especially scribblers - Curtly preferred to be curt. Even last night he chose to keep his thoughts to himself, living up to the anecdote about the time he overheard a journalist ask Viv Richards whether Curtly was feeling fit or not. \"You want to know about Curtly, you talk to Curtly,\" he growled. </p> <p>\"OK, Curtly. How are you feeling?\" </p> <p>\"Curtly talks to no one,\" he replied.</p>",

      "bodyText": "And today, we all presume, will be the day. Nasser Hussain will lift the long-forgotten Wisden Trophy; the crowd will run on the field, chant happily and maybe even sing; Jimmy Adams, the vanquished captain, will be gracious; and Lord MacLaurin, a member of the Raymond Illingworth School of letting-everyone-know-who-fathered -victory-and-ensuring-defeat-is-an-orphan, will probably be more visible than usual. It was Saturday morning when expectation hardened to near certainty. The moment can even be timed exactly: 11.43am. That was when Brian Lara was yet again bewildered by Craig White (a sentence one could not have anticipated writing only a few weeks ago). The Sun has been running a Wisdenometer, similar to the swingometer used on pre-computer election nights. At that point, it crashed towards England with the crunching certainty of the moment Portillo lost or Labour gained Hove. The fourth day of the Test (and that's an unexpected form of words too these days) was a linking passage between the catharsis of Saturday and the expected triumph today. It was a day of ovations, after a summer of them. The biggest came in Curtly Ambrose's last over in Test match cricket. But it was nothing to do with Ambrose: he was just the feed as Mike Atherton reached his century. As the crowd erupted, Ambrose stood impassively. He produced two more unmemorable deliveries then moved, on tender legs, towards the outfield and then cricketing history. You could almost SEE him creak. What a way to go. Six and a half years ago in Port of Spain, Ambrose blew away the aspirations of Athers, the tyro England captain, with one of the most devastating bowling bursts of all time. England were out for 46 - and defeat was such an orphan that even the team manager, MJK Smith, failed to support Atherton at his mournful press conference. Now Ambrose, and Courtney Walsh with him, has had to learn the truth that eagles can't soar when they are surrounded by turkeys. When Atherton was last man out (a few minutes after we had looked up all the carried-bat stats) the West Indians let him have his moment. The fast bowlers held back. Then it was their turn. Ambrose says he will never play Test cricket again. There is limited pleasure in a forthcoming tour of Australia in which West Indies will regard avoiding a 5-0 whitewash as their prime objective. Walsh is carrying on, because he is that sort, and because the virgin, mist-shrouded peak of 500 Test wickets is only 17 away. But even he cannot expect to bowl in a major match here again. So they both had their moment in the September sunshine. Walsh grinned and waved; Ambrose was more sombre. But they punched each other's fists, embraced and squabbled for a second about who would go first: \"After you, Courtney.\" \"No, after you, Curtly.\" Walsh won that round, and sent Ambrose in. And that was that. If we are ever going to see a great West Indian fast bowler tormenting our brave boys again, it is not obvious who, when or how. The mysterious factory that produced them all is shuttered and silent. There was a time when the line seemed endless, and it infiltrated batsmen's nightmares like the row of Banquo's crowned descendants haunting Macbeth. In the 1980s, supply so far exceeded demand that such players as Sylvester Clarke, Wayne Daniel, Ezra Moseley and Winston Davis, who would all have passed 100 Tests for England, hardly got a game. For the last time, we saw Ambrose stamp the ground, then lope in threateningly like a mutant killer giraffe. To the end, he provided living proof that precision bombing from a great height is possible. Perhaps the RAF should engage him as a consultant. Andy Roberts was perhaps the most ferocious of all the West Indians; Malcolm Marshall the most technically perfect; Michael Holding the most artistic; Walsh the most durable. But to the very end Ambrose was the most infallibly unhittable of them all. He got no wicket yesterday and so the wicket of Marcus Trescothick on Saturday was when his mum's famous bell rang for the 405th and final time. He will be remembered with affection by his team-mates, a shudder by opponents and awe by all who saw him. But for a man with such expressive features, he was remarkably inscrutable. Courtney was courtly; to strangers - especially scribblers - Curtly preferred to be curt. Even last night he chose to keep his thoughts to himself, living up to the anecdote about the time he overheard a journalist ask Viv Richards whether Curtly was feeling fit or not. \"You want to know about Curtly, you talk to Curtly,\" he growled. \"OK, Curtly. How are you feeling?\" \"Curtly talks to no one,\" he replied.",

      "body": "<p>After a week of exhilarating peaks and excruciating troughs it was perhaps inevitable that Mick McCarthy came away from the Netherlands with so many conflicting emotions that he did not know whether he should be elated or deflated. </p> <p>In the early hours of Sunday the Republic of Ireland manager was still too agitated to sleep. Instead he was propped up in a leather armchair, immersed in his thoughts in a piano bar overlooking the Noorder Amstel canal. A few hours earlier his players had not only ripped up the script for Louis van Gaal's first match in charge of Holland but played with such composure that the Dutch had been ashen-faced with stage fright. The Republic should have won but were pegged back. McCarthy looked shattered. </p> <p>In his mind they had been but a small hop away from their finest victory since Ray Houghton shinned a volley over Italy's Gianluca Pagliuca in the 1994 World Cup. That his players had seized a two-goal lead was a source of immense pride. That they had frittered it away late on left a smouldering sense of irritation. </p> <p>Judging by the way Gary Kelly punched the air in celebration while a few yards away Gary Breen was thumping the turf in disgust, his players had still to decide whether the result called for celebration or commiseration. But the breath-taking manner in which the Irish upstaged their illustrious opponents with an elaborate passing game - \"We outplayed them,\" stated Kevin Kilbane - was a triumph in itself. </p> <p>How ironic that McCarthy has brought about this transformation. Not long ago the craggy Yorkshireman was the broken-nosed epitome of Jack Charlton's hump-and-rush ne'er-do-wells. Certainly those who predicted that the Irish tactics would be of greater danger to the Amsterdam Arena's retractable roof than the Oranje defence were soon munching their way through a sizeable portion of humble pie. \"They played a very good passing game,\" Van Gaal volunteered. \"For a long time they were the superior team.\" </p> <p>For McCarthy there could hardly have been a better reference. His credibility had been questioned since Mark Kennedy and Phil Babb were arrested for allegedly taking a night of the frothy brown stuff too far in Dublin last Monday. This was the perfect riposte to any potential detractors. </p> <p>\"People have suggested my players lack respect for me,\" he said. \"You can look at that display and judge for yourself. We came to Holland, played them at their own game and matched them all the way.\"</p> <p>The tub-thumping was understandable. Kilbane, Mark Kinsella and Jason McAteer arguably had their best games for the Republic. In defence it was scarcely plausible that Richard Dunne and Breen had experienced only 18 minutes' competitive action this season. Niall Quinn had his usual nuisance value and the coltish Robbie Keane just keeps on improving. </p> <p>\"We're good players and we've got to start giving ourselves more credit,\" said the captain Roy Keane. \"People are always saying the Irish will have a good time whatever the result, and I'm sick of that stuff. We're better than that and we should stop underestimating ourselves.\" </p> <p>Both Irish goals originated from incisive counter-attacks. Robbie Keane hurtled into the six-yard area to meet McAteer's right-wing cross on 21 minutes with a powerful header and then the Blackburn midfielder rounded off another flowing move with a swerving left-foot finish from 20 yards on 65. </p> <p>But they could not keep it going. Having stayed at the hotel where John Lennon and Yoko Ono staged their sleep-in, the Irish defence showed a similar lethargy in allowing Jeffrey Talan a sloppy headed goal. Then, six minutes from time, Giovanni van Bronckhorst scored with the most venomous of left-foot shots, albeit with a deflection off Kinsella. </p> <p> <strong> Holland</strong> (4-4-1-1): Van der Sar; Reiziger (Seedorf, h-t), F de Boer, Konterman (Talan, 65min), Van Bronckhorst; R de Boer, Witschge (Bruggink, 61), Bosvelt, Bouma; Cocu; Kluivert. </p> <p><strong> Republic of Ireland</strong> (4-4-2): A Kelly; Carr, Dunne, Breen, Harte; McAteer (G Kelly, 75), Roy Keane, Kinsella, Kilbane (Staunton, 80); N Quinn (Connolly, 72), Robbie Keane. </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> L Michel (Slovakia).</p>",

Certainly those who predicted that the Irish tactics would be of greater danger to the Amsterdam Arena's retractable roof than the Oranje defence were soon munching their way through a sizeable portion of humble pie. \"They played a very good passing game,\" Van Gaal volunteered. \"For a long time they were the superior team.\" For McCarthy there could hardly have been a better reference. His credibility had been questioned since Mark Kennedy and Phil Babb were arrested for allegedly taking a night of the frothy brown stuff too far in Dublin last Monday. This was the perfect riposte to any potential detractors. \"People have suggested my players lack respect for me,\" he said. \"You can look at that display and judge for yourself. We came to Holland, played them at their own game and matched them all the way.\" The tub-thumping was understandable. Kilbane, Mark Kinsella and Jason McAteer arguably had their best games for the Republic. In defence it was scarcely plausible that Richard Dunne and Breen had experienced only 18 minutes' competitive action this season. Niall Quinn had his usual nuisance value and the coltish Robbie Keane just keeps on improving. \"We're good players and we've got to start giving ourselves more credit,\" said the captain Roy Keane. \"People are always saying the Irish will have a good time whatever the result, and I'm sick of that stuff. We're better than that and we should stop underestimating ourselves.\" Both Irish goals originated from incisive counter-attacks. Robbie Keane hurtled into the six-yard area to meet McAteer's right-wing cross on 21 minutes with a powerful header and then the Blackburn midfielder rounded off another flowing move with a swerving left-foot finish from 20 yards on 65. But they could not keep it going. Having stayed at the hotel where John Lennon and Yoko Ono staged their sleep-in, the Irish defence showed a similar lethargy in allowing Jeffrey Talan a sloppy headed goal. Then, six minutes from time, Giovanni van Bronckhorst scored with the most venomous of left-foot shots, albeit with a deflection off Kinsella. Holland (4-4-1-1): Van der Sar; Reiziger (Seedorf, h-t), F de Boer, Konterman (Talan, 65min), Van Bronckhorst; R de Boer, Witschge (Bruggink, 61), Bosvelt, Bouma; Cocu; Kluivert. Republic of Ireland (4-4-2): A Kelly; Carr, Dunne, Breen, Harte; McAteer (G Kelly, 75), Roy Keane, Kinsella, Kilbane (Staunton, 80); N Quinn (Connolly, 72), Robbie Keane. Referee: L Michel (Slovakia).",

But having taken the decision, Keegan really should have made it his business to ensure the world understood that this did not entail a demotion of Owen.

Either side of the decisive moment, he scarcely got a touch. But when Beckham and Steve McManaman built a move that brought the ball across the France penalty area from left to right, and when Kieron Dyer exploited the momentary absence of Bixente Lizarazu to dart down into the gap and slip a lethal cross into the goalmouth, there was Owen, anticipating the ball's path and arriving a yard in front of Frank Leboeuf before turning a magnificent volley - the perfect product of instinct and technique - past the previously impregnable Lama. </p> <p>There can be no doubt now, even in Keegan's mind, about which Englishman is more likely to score international goals. Beckham? One goal in 35 appearances. Cole? None in eight. Emile Heskey? One in nine. Scholes, of course, has 10 in 28, including two hat-tricks, but he is a supporting player, not a chief striker. And Owen is the only one who ever looks likely to get you a goal out of nothing, as he did against Brazil in May. </p> <p>Not that the Beckham-Scholes-Cole axis did badly on Saturday night, considering they were up against the world and European champions, and a four-man defence that had never been beaten as a unit and, in their last appearance together, had no intention of surrendering that proud record. England's approach play in the first half was fully the equal of France's, and their chances were the more clear-cut, although it has to be remembered that several key members of the home team have yet to begin their league seasons in Italy and Spain, and were clearly lacking the final competitive edge. </p> <p>Yet the match itself had plenty of edge, in the sense that every player seemed aware of the fact that pride, individual and collective, was at stake. No doubt the recent influx of French players into the English league - and out again, trailing clouds of acrimony, in two or three cases - has added an extra dimension to the fixture, and there was more than enough harshness in the challenges to remove it entirely from the realm of meaningless friendlies. </p> <p>Not unexpectedly, it was Dennis Wise wot started it, catching Zinedine Zidane on the side of the head inside the first minute.

R\u00e9my Aubard was one of tens of thousands of young men deported from France to work without pay in the factories of the Third Reich. The outcome of his case, to be heard by a Paris court later this year, could revive old animosities and seriously embarrass the present German government. Mr Aubard, then a young Citroen mechanic, was just over 18 years of age when he was arrested while trying to join Allied forces in North Africa. With 911 others, he was held in a detention centre near Compi\u00e8gne and then deported to Buchenwald concentration camp in October 1943. \"I spent 19 months there and I very nearly died,\" he said. \"My health was seriously affected by working 72 hours a week in the factory until the camp was liberated by its inmates on April 11, 1945.\" Mr Aubard was part of the camp's so-called Schonebeck Kommando, put to work by the nearby Junkers Flugzeug und Motorenwerke factory - whose shareholders included Field Marshall Hermann Goering - to make fighter parts and components for the feared V2 rocket. \"From December 1 1943 to March 10 1945, I was forced to work there every day, under the eye of the SS, from 5 am to 6pm,\" he said. \"There was a bowl of soup at midday and that was it. I was never paid. There were pay vouchers, but they were worthless. What could you buy in Buchenwald? Nothing.\" In July, the German government and a number of large industrial conglomerates agreed, after decades of international pressure, to set up a \u00a33.3bn fund to compensate the estimated 10m forced or slave labourers who worked in wartime Nazi factories, but all the signs are that this could take years. Mr Aubard's claim is aimed at ensuring he gets his money while he can still make use of it. His lawyer, Emmanuel Ludot, has established that the Nazi regime billed Junkers about four marks a day for each forced labourer it supplied, at a time when the average German worker was paid 9 marks. He has calculated that, in today's terms, Mr Aubard is owed \u00a340,000 in back pay, and is also claiming \u00a350,000 in damages and interest. \"It is intolerable that the forced foreign labour from which the German state benefited has never been accounted for,\" Mr Ludot said. \"Deported labourers were reduced to the status of slaves for months - if not years - and they deserve justice today.\" Several associations of deported French labourers, who have tried for decades without success to obtain reparations from Berlin, are backing Mr Aubard's claim. \"This whole matter has never been settled,\" said Guy Ducolon\u00e9, a former MP and president of a group of one-time Buchenwald inmates. \"The technical obstacles, like calculating how much money is really owed in view not just of the work performed but the inhuman conditions it was performed in, have got more and more difficult to overcome as the years have gone by. \"That's why this case is so interesting: a precise sum has been named.

      "body": "<p>What big teeth he has, I thought to myself as I looked at the photograph of arch Eurosceptic Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan, which grinned out at me from the front page of the Guardian. I met him years ago when he was a student up at Oxford. It seems his opinions haven't mellowed since.</p> <p>Yesterday he was scheduled to deliver a speech on the evils of the euro to the annual congress of an ultra-nationalist Danish party. Whatever they made of him in Denmark, to this particular Tory girl he looks like a good reason to sit tight on the euro fence.</p> <p>I remember him as a clever, ambitious and arrogant boy who offered me some rather creepy advice on a suitable school for my children. To be specific he recommended his old prep school as an excellent establishment. It was sink or swim there, he said: just the place for my sons, if they were up to it.</p> <p>I was repelled by what was, apparently, enthusiasm for a kind of social Darwinism. But not surprised. It was an attitude typical of his generation.</p> <p>When I voted for Margaret Thatcher in 1979, I did so because I wanted to be part of a \"can do\" Britain. I don't regret doing so. But somewhere along the line the \"can do\" Britain she created became \"I can do and damn the rest of you\".</p> <p>If socialism was destroyed, so too was the One Nation Tory notion of capitalism with a conscience. Conservatives raised in the 80s embraced market forces as the will of mammon. For the next decade it was survival of the fittest where I live in the Tory shires, as elsewhere. Riding schools, for example, closed one after the other, broken by the new business rates that took no account of work as a way of life.</p> <p>Farmers, suffering the beginnings of a general agricultural depression, were told by shires MPs that they didn't matter - until the BSE tragedy struck. When the EU banned the importation of British beef, those Conservative MPs who made a virtue of knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing suddenly began to berate us on the dangers Europe posed to good Olde England.</p> <p>What on earth was going on? It didn't go unnoticed that farmers couldn't benefit from the abuse our leaders were heaping on our continental partners. They were mere fodder in an anti-euro war.</p> <p>And was this the great patriotic war it was sold as? Certainly for some it may really have been about the defence of parliamentary democracy and not wanting to hand your hard-earned money to some unelected German bureaucrat, who would only use it to improve the lot of the citizens of Berlin or Bonn.</p> <p>However, some of the right's attacks on the euro do seem to have been inspired not so much by a love for Olde England as by a fondness for New England. And your average educated Tory is not going to step in to a slit trench with anyone who wants to turn his country into Uncle Sam's mini me, an entity formed almost entirely from the least attractive aspects of American culture. These include the populist politics (you can shoot burglars and name paedophiles to your hearts content over there) and the estimation of a man by the size of his salary.</p> <p>And there is an obvious point there that they miss. Britain isn't rich enough for Americans to love us back, or even notice us.</p> <p>A professor of history at an American university explained to me recently that Hollywood has English actors playing the bad guys in their movies, not because we figure in their imaginations, but rather as a dig against their own ruling class, who are, by and large, of English descent.</p> <p>There is no genuine special relationship between us and the US, only the potential for one. As senior Americans never fail to remind us, it would only be if we were powerful in Europe, which is a big place, that they might regard us as worth knowing.</p> <p>Yet, on the other side of the argument, the trouble is that Englishmen did not found the EU, as we did the US. And who knows what we might lose as a nation if we gave up our currency?

      "bodyText": "What big teeth he has, I thought to myself as I looked at the photograph of arch Eurosceptic Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan, which grinned out at me from the front page of the Guardian. I met him years ago when he was a student up at Oxford. It seems his opinions haven't mellowed since. Yesterday he was scheduled to deliver a speech on the evils of the euro to the annual congress of an ultra-nationalist Danish party. Whatever they made of him in Denmark, to this particular Tory girl he looks like a good reason to sit tight on the euro fence. I remember him as a clever, ambitious and arrogant boy who offered me some rather creepy advice on a suitable school for my children. To be specific he recommended his old prep school as an excellent establishment. It was sink or swim there, he said: just the place for my sons, if they were up to it. I was repelled by what was, apparently, enthusiasm for a kind of social Darwinism. But not surprised. It was an attitude typical of his generation. When I voted for Margaret Thatcher in 1979, I did so because I wanted to be part of a \"can do\" Britain. I don't regret doing so. But somewhere along the line the \"can do\" Britain she created became \"I can do and damn the rest of you\". If socialism was destroyed, so too was the One Nation Tory notion of capitalism with a conscience. Conservatives raised in the 80s embraced market forces as the will of mammon. For the next decade it was survival of the fittest where I live in the Tory shires, as elsewhere. Riding schools, for example, closed one after the other, broken by the new business rates that took no account of work as a way of life. Farmers, suffering the beginnings of a general agricultural depression, were told by shires MPs that they didn't matter - until the BSE tragedy struck. When the EU banned the importation of British beef, those Conservative MPs who made a virtue of knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing suddenly began to berate us on the dangers Europe posed to good Olde England. What on earth was going on? It didn't go unnoticed that farmers couldn't benefit from the abuse our leaders were heaping on our continental partners. They were mere fodder in an anti-euro war. And was this the great patriotic war it was sold as? Certainly for some it may really have been about the defence of parliamentary democracy and not wanting to hand your hard-earned money to some unelected German bureaucrat, who would only use it to improve the lot of the citizens of Berlin or Bonn. However, some of the right's attacks on the euro do seem to have been inspired not so much by a love for Olde England as by a fondness for New England. And your average educated Tory is not going to step in to a slit trench with anyone who wants to turn his country into Uncle Sam's mini me, an entity formed almost entirely from the least attractive aspects of American culture. These include the populist politics (you can shoot burglars and name paedophiles to your hearts content over there) and the estimation of a man by the size of his salary. And there is an obvious point there that they miss. Britain isn't rich enough for Americans to love us back, or even notice us. A professor of history at an American university explained to me recently that Hollywood has English actors playing the bad guys in their movies, not because we figure in their imaginations, but rather as a dig against their own ruling class, who are, by and large, of English descent. There is no genuine special relationship between us and the US, only the potential for one. As senior Americans never fail to remind us, it would only be if we were powerful in Europe, which is a big place, that they might regard us as worth knowing. Yet, on the other side of the argument, the trouble is that Englishmen did not found the EU, as we did the US. And who knows what we might lose as a nation if we gave up our currency? Who knows what we might lose personally, from our pockets, if we joined? In common with the majority of people in Britain, I am suspicious of European institutions and have no enthusiasm for the euro. But what's the alternative? Sitting up on the euro fence I look down with trepidation at the choice between the likes of devilish Daniel Hannan and a deep blue sea. You might think that being fanatically opposed to Britain joining the euro is the sine qua non of being a Conservative. But you'd be wrong. The latest Gallup poll indicates that only 26% of Daily Telegraph readers are in favour of it, while a further 40% are up on the fence with me saying, \"wait and see\". It is not a comfortable position to be in and I'm sure most of us are willing to be tempted down. But we won't be attracted by anyone who spits when they talk. I fear that rules out the likes of Mr Hannan. comment@theguardian.com",

For months, Europe's central bankers and politicians have been saying that the euro is fundamentally undervalued and will soon deliver a knockout blow to the over-confident dollar. But, somehow, it never seems to happen. Capital is still flowing into the US and out of Europe, and it is this rather than the counterpart, Europe's trade surplus and America's trade deficit, that is affecting currency values. </p> <p>Two of the UK groups that oppose monetary union, Business for Sterling and New Europe, today launch a campaign designed to point out the benefits of staying out and the risks of going in, and they could hardly have picked a more propitious moment to do so. Talking up the euro hasn't worked, higher interest rates haven't worked, massive G7 intervention is not on the agenda because the Democrats are relying on the strong dollar to damp down US inflation, underpin share prices on Wall Street and ensure that the planned slowdown in American growth does not turn into a hard landing. </p> <p>So what is to be done? One long-term answer could be to put the euro out of its misery altogether and decide that monetary union in Europe is merely a stepping stone to global monetary union with the dollar as the single currency. Inadvertently perhaps, the justification for such a move was provided by a recent pamphlet produced by Britain in Europe, the lobby group that favours sterling's entry into the single currency. </p> <p>The report, quite fairly, does not pretend that euroland has a better job creation record than the UK (which it does not) and concedes that there are risks involved in both joining the euro and in staying out. But, interestingly, the reasons that it says tip the balance in its favour - the ability of businesses to sell more widely, achieving the \"massive economies of scale seen in America\", removing the barriers to trade represented by \"separate currencies\", limiting currency fluctuations, and having greater influence in decision-making would all seem to be arguments in favour of one world currency. </p> <p>If the name of the game is removing barriers then why stop at Europe? The inexorable logic of the BiE report is that making life easier for business will lead to higher growth and hence all of us will reap the trickle-down benefits of higher living standards. So, in classic Thatcherite fashion, the more barriers that can be removed the better, and given that more than 60% of world trade and inward investment are between North America, Western Europe and Japan, this ought to mean just one big currency. Indeed, two of the people responsible for the BiE paper, Robert Mundell and Willem Buiter, are supporters of a world currency. </p> <p>Would there be advantages to this, in addition to the obvious benefit to those in the euro zone of having Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve in charge of monetary policy rather than the hapless ECB? Well, it would put an end to currency speculation. Yoked together by a single currency, governments in the rich countries could settle their differences and push for a new trade round to remove any other barriers to business that threaten the ability of their multinationals to prise open new markets. </p> <p>Moreover, technically speaking, this would be the perfect moment to amalgamate the three major currencies into one. Give or take a few cents, one dollar buys one euro buys 100 yen. Rebase the yen so that 100 old yen equals one new yen and the three currencies would all trade at close to parity. </p> <p> Given the premise of the BiE paper, this makes as much sense as British membership of the euro, and is subject to the same two objections. The first is economic: the fact that the right monetary policy for the US at the present would certainly not be the right monetary policy for Japan, just as the monetary policy that is right for Germany is not right for Ireland. </p> <p><strong> Tower of Babel</strong><br> Had Britain joined monetary union in 1999 and cut interest rates to 3%, it is clear that inflation would now be well above its 2.5% target and the government would be under considerable pressure to tighten fiscal policy to counterbalance the monetary laxity. Ireland, with inflation above 6%, has negative real interest rates, which is totally inappropriate. </p> <p>The second is political: the reluctance of people to give up democratic rights even if that does involve accepting a degree of inefficiency. Europe is a case in point, here. All EU documents are published in 11 languages, and this requires non-stop work for 1,900 translators working in the appropriately named Tower of Babel in Brussels. In terms of economic efficiency, it would make far better sense to have one language. But were it to be said that Europe needed one language as well as one money there would be outrage, and rightly so. Language is not just about making money, but is a part of culture and an individual right. It cannot be bargained away to improve profitability. </p> <p>Inadvertently perhaps, the BiE report lets the cat out of the bag. Monetary union is not there to create a European redoubt against the Americanisation of the global economy, but to give succour to all those intent on dismantling the European social model. This is a problem for the Little Europeans who hope vainly that monetary union is a device for keeping the nasty Americans at bay, and see British entry into monetary union as the only way to safeguard Europe's identity. </p> <p>The government certainly does not see it this way. As far as can be determined from its delphic pronouncements, Labour is with the globalisers not the Uncle Sam bashers, buying the argument from its big business chums that monetary union will help to make Europe more dynamic (more profits for business) and flexible (fewer benefits for workers). Unfortunately, the government is allowed to get away with the pretence that there is something progressive about this because William Hague keeps insisting that monetary union is a socialist plot.

A reviewer in Opera magazine commented that she was \"a convincing Mimi, really looking the part, and achieving the utmost pathos with the simplest of means\".

Danco's Melisande strikes just the right balance between knowingness and innocence, a paradox at the heart of that equivocal role.

To the accusation that Ofsted, the schools inspectorate for England, has disillusioned teachers, he says: \"I strongly believe that in the long term impact on morale has been positive.\"</p> <p>But the language of his and Ofsted's critics - \"witchfinder-general\" (Barry Sheerman, chairman of the Commons education sub-committee), and \"the Spanish inquisition\" (Mick Brookes, president of the National Association of Head Teachers) - reflects the persistent complaint that he has created a climate in schools where good teachers leave and potentially good teachers don't join; that the inspection system imposes insufferable strain on heads, on teachers, and on pupils.</p> <p>\"It is inevitably going to be stressful in the sense that the school knows something is going to be written on them, that individual teachers are going to have somebody sitting in the back of their classroom. I don't think it should be and need be stressful to the extent that some people appear to believe,\" says Mr Woodhead.</p> <p>\"A school is inspected once every four or five years. You as a teacher will be seen perhaps three periods in that four to five years. The inspector is required to talk to you about what he or she thinks of your performance. You have the opportunity to put your point of view. Is this unreasonable?\"</p> <p>While he acknowledges that when the Ofsted hammer falls on a school deemed to be failing, there is \"in the short-term, a negative impact on pupils who will feel badly about what's happened to them\", in time those schools thank him.</p> <p>The last time he looked there were \"13,000\" incompetent teachers, but new, light inspections for successful schools means he will not be able to confidently make such headline-grabbing judgments in future.</p> <p>He expects his annual report next year will cover \"the same basic themes\", describing \"very radical and very positive\" changes in primary schools since the in troduction of the literacy and numeracy strategies, but a more mixed picture in secondary schools, and continued problems with writing ability across the board.</p> <p>\"The only way the morale of the profession is going to improve is when teachers teach better. Because when teachers teach better, children will learn more, and when children learn more their parents will respect teachers more. And when teachers have got the respect of parents in the local community they are going to feel better about themselves.</p> <p><b> Morale booster</b><br> \"Ofsted contributes to this virtuous circle by showing parents where schools and teachers are doing a good job and where there are problems bringing those problems out into the open so that solutions can be found and things can get better.\"</p> <p>Even if it could be proved to Mr Woodhead that teachers' morale was damaged by Ofsted, that would not invalidate his organisation's work. \"I don't think it is our job. If I was primarily concerned with the morale of the teaching profession that would inhibit the ability of Ofsted to report accurately on what it sees. My first and foremost responsibility is to tell the truth about the schools that we inspect. And if, to put it bluntly, we find things are wrong and we have to say that, then so be it. The interests of the children and the accuracy of the report are more important than the feelings of the teachers.\"</p> <p>He was once a teacher himself, from 1969-1976. But he got bored and moved into teacher training, and then policy, as an adviser on English, a county education officer and chief executive of the national curriculum council. \"I do need new challenges, different situations, so I sought those out.\"</p> <p>Doesn't that make him unsympathetic to teachers who have stuck with it, year after year? \"No, the reverse actually. I'm full of admiration for those people who have maintained their enthusiasm, and in some ways I'm envious.\"</p> <p>How, one wonders, would the chief inspector of today have fared during an Ofsted inspection of the teacher he was then? He was, by most accounts, somewhat liberal, even trendy.</p> <p>\"I don't know. My views about teaching have changed, although I think Ted Wragg [professor of education at Exeter University] and others have tended to exaggerate the extent of the change.</p> <p>\"As an English teacher I always believed in the importance of spelling and grammar. I always believed in the importance of trying to inculcate a level of literature - trying to, I didn't always succeed. I think and I hope that I would be marked reasonably positively. It's a long time ago and I might be deluding myself.\"</p> <p>When his current contract runs out in 2003, Mr Woodhead will have been chief inspector for nine years. He will earn \u00a3124,000 plus a bonus of up to 10% this year. His empire is undergoing a major expansion as Ofsted takes on the main responsibility for inspecting all sixth-form and further education colleges; and for registering and inspecting about 100,000 childminders, nursery and playgroup workers, an operation that will expand Ofsted's staff from 500 to about 2,500, mostly former local authority workers.</p> <p>Once he has that sorted, there is just a flicker of a hint that Mr Woodhead, now 53, might call it a day.</p> <p>The Department for Education and Employment tells the Guardian there is no term limit, his contract could be renewed again and again. But Mr Woodhead is under the impression that he is only allowed to do two five-year terms. \"Whether, if I so wanted and the government wanted me to, I could do a third term, I just don't know.\" And after Ofsted? Maybe another job. \"I've still got a fair amount of energy.\"</p> <p>Last year there were moments when Mr Woodhead thought his tenure might end sooner rather than later.</p> <p>He had said, at Prof Wragg's university, that relationships between sixth-formers and teachers could be \"experiential and educative\" - as the government was planning legislation to make such relationships illegal. Although he withdrew his comments, his ex-wife Cathy then claimed that his relationship with Amanda Johnston, a former pupil of his, had begun while she was still at school; a charge Ms Johnston and Mr Woodhead had both denied in signed statements. Cue furore. The strain of the controversy contributed to the break-up of his10-year relationship with Ruth Miskin, the head of a primary school in Tower Hamlets, in London. He is currently unattached. But backed by Tony Blair and David Blunkett, the education secretary, he held on.</p> <p>\"It would be dishonest to say that when you read in the papers, day in, day out, that people are calling for your resignation you don't wonder about your ability to carry on.</p> <p>\"And to an extent, of course, my ability to do the job depends on my credibility, and innuendo, rumour, allegation and gossip can erode credibility. So yeah, I wondered, although my basic feeling throughout was that I was determined to do the job that I was paid to do and I'd go on doing it. And the more it became clear that to an extent all this had a fair bit to do with people who didn't like me as chief inspector, the more determined I was to do stick it out.</p> <p>\"When you've been through an experience like that then it does put other things in perspective. When there's some controversy about a policy difference between me and Blair or Blunkett, really that doesn't bother me in the slightest. It's a different order of things.</p> <p>\"You also know that life goes on and I think that with any job you've got to be able to walk away from it. Having said I was determined to stay, I knew that if I decided to go or somebody else decided that I had to go, then so be it, I could accept that.\"</p> <p><b> Party politics</b><br> Mr Blunkett would have been less distraught than Mr Blair if Mr Woodhead had decided to fall. But the chief inspector says: \"My feeling from where I sat then was that both David Blunkett and Tony Blair were supportive of me in a difficult situation.\" He sees the prime minister formally three times a year, at \"summits\" in Downing Street. \"There may be other occasions, but not often ... I've always found him interested in what Ofsted's doing, supportive of what we are doing and generally sympathetic to the kinds of values and arguments that I have put forward.\"</p> <p>Mr Blunkett has a meeting with him every month or so, without officials. \"It's up to him as to whether he acts on what I've got to say, but in terms of receiving the message, I've got no complaints at all.\"</p> <p>He does not see William Hague, who wants to give him even more power and, no, he didn't advise the Tory leader on his recent \"free schools\" speech, even though he said that it had \"struck a chord\". \"In fact,\" says Mr Woodhead, \"there isn't a great deal of party political difference.\"</p> <p>He restrains himself on some issues, grammar schools for instance, although he pointedly praises their inspection record. But no one can accuse him of not speaking out. He raided into higher education territory recently, not his responsibility at all, blasting vocational degree courses.</p> <p>The prime minister wants half of all under 30s to have participated in higher education. Mr Woodhead says: \"There is obviously a danger if we go down the expansion road for the sake of expansion, that universities are forced into a situation where in order to fill the places they lower their standards of admission. That would be a great mistake.\"</p> <p>He welcomes changes to the new post-16 curriculum which will provide alternatives to traditional A-levels, in vocational A-levels and advanced GNVQs [General National Vocational Qualification]. But at the same time, he says: \"What I don't want is a sort of blurring of the distinctions so that you erode what seems to me virtuous and necessary in the traditional A-level.</p> <p>\"Part of the function of examinations is to make distinctions between people for employers, higher education or whatever. If everybody is passing, everybody has a reward, then I do think we've got problems... it is vitally important that we hold on to the notion of traditional academic excellence.\"</p> <p>\"Curriculum 2000\" will encourage all students to take more vocational qualifications, and certainly to study a greater variety. Sixth-formers will be expected to complete four or five AS-level subjects in the first half of their course before taking three A-levels.</p> <p>Mr Woodhead says: \"I'm not necessarily a supporter of breadth for breadth's sake. There are students who have got for example 10 A grades at GCSE, who want to study three subjects at A-level and who can benefit from the in-depth pursuit of knowledge in those three subjects.</p> <p>\"They've demonstrated the breadth of their achievement at GCSE and I can't see myself why they shouldn't have the opportunity post-16 to pursue the subjects that they want to pursue.\"</p> <p>On the relatively poor performance of boys at A-level and GCSE, which dominated the agenda while Mr Woodhead was on holiday, he is less concerned than you might expect.</p> <p>He says he has not spoken to Mr Blunkett about it. \"I don't think there's any panacea.\" He once publicly worried about the performance of working-class white boys, but he says now: \"I'm not particularly persuaded that we are seeing a laddish culture that we have never seen before. I think boys have always been tempted by laddish behaviour and there's nothing radically new now in 2000 that wasn't there when I was growing up.\" It is \"wholly positive\" that the rising expectations of girls are being measured in exams.</p> <p>\"The answer, if we need an answer, lies in the remorseless application of good teaching.\" Remorseless application: Mr Woodhead, for better or worse, is good at that.</p>",

And when teachers have got the respect of parents in the local community they are going to feel better about themselves. Morale booster \"Ofsted contributes to this virtuous circle by showing parents where schools and teachers are doing a good job and where there are problems bringing those problems out into the open so that solutions can be found and things can get better.\" Even if it could be proved to Mr Woodhead that teachers' morale was damaged by Ofsted, that would not invalidate his organisation's work. \"I don't think it is our job. If I was primarily concerned with the morale of the teaching profession that would inhibit the ability of Ofsted to report accurately on what it sees. My first and foremost responsibility is to tell the truth about the schools that we inspect. And if, to put it bluntly, we find things are wrong and we have to say that, then so be it. The interests of the children and the accuracy of the report are more important than the feelings of the teachers.\" He was once a teacher himself, from 1969-1976. But he got bored and moved into teacher training, and then policy, as an adviser on English, a county education officer and chief executive of the national curriculum council. \"I do need new challenges, different situations, so I sought those out.\" Doesn't that make him unsympathetic to teachers who have stuck with it, year after year? \"No, the reverse actually. I'm full of admiration for those people who have maintained their enthusiasm, and in some ways I'm envious.\" How, one wonders, would the chief inspector of today have fared during an Ofsted inspection of the teacher he was then? He was, by most accounts, somewhat liberal, even trendy. \"I don't know. My views about teaching have changed, although I think Ted Wragg [professor of education at Exeter University] and others have tended to exaggerate the extent of the change. \"As an English teacher I always believed in the importance of spelling and grammar. I always believed in the importance of trying to inculcate a level of literature - trying to, I didn't always succeed. I think and I hope that I would be marked reasonably positively. It's a long time ago and I might be deluding myself.\" When his current contract runs out in 2003, Mr Woodhead will have been chief inspector for nine years. He will earn \u00a3124,000 plus a bonus of up to 10% this year. His empire is undergoing a major expansion as Ofsted takes on the main responsibility for inspecting all sixth-form and further education colleges; and for registering and inspecting about 100,000 childminders, nursery and playgroup workers, an operation that will expand Ofsted's staff from 500 to about 2,500, mostly former local authority workers. Once he has that sorted, there is just a flicker of a hint that Mr Woodhead, now 53, might call it a day. The Department for Education and Employment tells the Guardian there is no term limit, his contract could be renewed again and again. But Mr Woodhead is under the impression that he is only allowed to do two five-year terms. \"Whether, if I so wanted and the government wanted me to, I could do a third term, I just don't know.\" And after Ofsted? Maybe another job. \"I've still got a fair amount of energy.\" Last year there were moments when Mr Woodhead thought his tenure might end sooner rather than later. He had said, at Prof Wragg's university, that relationships between sixth-formers and teachers could be \"experiential and educative\" - as the government was planning legislation to make such relationships illegal. Although he withdrew his comments, his ex-wife Cathy then claimed that his relationship with Amanda Johnston, a former pupil of his, had begun while she was still at school; a charge Ms Johnston and Mr Woodhead had both denied in signed statements. Cue furore. The strain of the controversy contributed to the break-up of his10-year relationship with Ruth Miskin, the head of a primary school in Tower Hamlets, in London. He is currently unattached. But backed by Tony Blair and David Blunkett, the education secretary, he held on. \"It would be dishonest to say that when you read in the papers, day in, day out, that people are calling for your resignation you don't wonder about your ability to carry on. \"And to an extent, of course, my ability to do the job depends on my credibility, and innuendo, rumour, allegation and gossip can erode credibility. So yeah, I wondered, although my basic feeling throughout was that I was determined to do the job that I was paid to do and I'd go on doing it. And the more it became clear that to an extent all this had a fair bit to do with people who didn't like me as chief inspector, the more determined I was to do stick it out. \"When you've been through an experience like that then it does put other things in perspective. When there's some controversy about a policy difference between me and Blair or Blunkett, really that doesn't bother me in the slightest. It's a different order of things. \"You also know that life goes on and I think that with any job you've got to be able to walk away from it. Having said I was determined to stay, I knew that if I decided to go or somebody else decided that I had to go, then so be it, I could accept that.\" Party politics Mr Blunkett would have been less distraught than Mr Blair if Mr Woodhead had decided to fall. But the chief inspector says: \"My feeling from where I sat then was that both David Blunkett and Tony Blair were supportive of me in a difficult situation.\" He sees the prime minister formally three times a year, at \"summits\" in Downing Street. \"There may be other occasions, but not often ... I've always found him interested in what Ofsted's doing, supportive of what we are doing and generally sympathetic to the kinds of values and arguments that I have put forward.\" Mr Blunkett has a meeting with him every month or so, without officials. \"It's up to him as to whether he acts on what I've got to say, but in terms of receiving the message, I've got no complaints at all.\" He does not see William Hague, who wants to give him even more power and, no, he didn't advise the Tory leader on his recent \"free schools\" speech, even though he said that it had \"struck a chord\". \"In fact,\" says Mr Woodhead, \"there isn't a great deal of party political difference.\" He restrains himself on some issues, grammar schools for instance, although he pointedly praises their inspection record. But no one can accuse him of not speaking out. He raided into higher education territory recently, not his responsibility at all, blasting vocational degree courses. The prime minister wants half of all under 30s to have participated in higher education. Mr Woodhead says: \"There is obviously a danger if we go down the expansion road for the sake of expansion, that universities are forced into a situation where in order to fill the places they lower their standards of admission. That would be a great mistake.\" He welcomes changes to the new post-16 curriculum which will provide alternatives to traditional A-levels, in vocational A-levels and advanced GNVQs [General National Vocational Qualification]. But at the same time, he says: \"What I don't want is a sort of blurring of the distinctions so that you erode what seems to me virtuous and necessary in the traditional A-level. \"Part of the function of examinations is to make distinctions between people for employers, higher education or whatever. If everybody is passing, everybody has a reward, then I do think we've got problems... it is vitally important that we hold on to the notion of traditional academic excellence.\" \"Curriculum 2000\" will encourage all students to take more vocational qualifications, and certainly to study a greater variety. Sixth-formers will be expected to complete four or five AS-level subjects in the first half of their course before taking three A-levels. Mr Woodhead says: \"I'm not necessarily a supporter of breadth for breadth's sake. There are students who have got for example 10 A grades at GCSE, who want to study three subjects at A-level and who can benefit from the in-depth pursuit of knowledge in those three subjects. \"They've demonstrated the breadth of their achievement at GCSE and I can't see myself why they shouldn't have the opportunity post-16 to pursue the subjects that they want to pursue.\" On the relatively poor performance of boys at A-level and GCSE, which dominated the agenda while Mr Woodhead was on holiday, he is less concerned than you might expect. He says he has not spoken to Mr Blunkett about it. \"I don't think there's any panacea.\" He once publicly worried about the performance of working-class white boys, but he says now: \"I'm not particularly persuaded that we are seeing a laddish culture that we have never seen before. I think boys have always been tempted by laddish behaviour and there's nothing radically new now in 2000 that wasn't there when I was growing up.\" It is \"wholly positive\" that the rising expectations of girls are being measured in exams. \"The answer, if we need an answer, lies in the remorseless application of good teaching.\" Remorseless application: Mr Woodhead, for better or worse, is good at that.",

Connex, owned by the French multinational Vivendi, has been consistently criticised for poor performance and its record is not improving. Industry sources said last night that considerable doubts about its record meant that it would not get a new franchise. It has agreed to pump more than \u00a31bn into a new contract, but has been criticised for making too many drivers redundant and operating dirty trains. One government source said last night: \"I would not put any money on Connex getting the franchise.\" Keith Hill, the transport minister, said that no specific targets dates existed for the new franchises to be negotiated. The Connex franchise does not come up for renegotiation until 2003, and Mr Hill said that the length of the new franchises will be \"entirely dependent\"' on the amount of investment. Mr Prescott has told the SSRA to re-examine the situation, given the sensitive political situation surrounding the new contracts. Several senior managers at Connex have been sacked in an attempt to improve its image. The position of Govia is just as crucial. It operates Thames Trains, the company which was heavily criticised during the Paddington rail crash. It was exposed for poor driver training after the driver of the Thames Turbo, which collided with an InterCity express from Cheltenham to Paddington, was said to have been given little knowledge of routes into Paddington. Government sources said that it may require the SSRA to conduct a new review of the rail franchise programme because of the uncertainty of several key players. However, a spokesman for the rail authority said that it was still hoping to award the south central London franchise in the autumn, and that there was no question of it starting the rebidding process again.",

      "bodyText": "Al Gore has swept into the lead in a series of opinion polls in the battleground states in the US presidential election, turning the contest to succeed Bill Clinton into a genuine two-horse race with his Republican rival, George W Bush. The battle for the White House moves into top gear today, the traditional Labour Day holiday, as the two contenders begin the final 64 days of intensive campaigning leading up to the November 7 election. As they do so, they face a political landscape which has been dramatically changed by the August party conventions. In the latest national poll in Newsweek magazine, Mr Gore leads by 49% to 39%, a 10.5% swing compared with a month ago, when Mr Bush led in a similar poll by 49% to 38%. Traditional American political wisdom says that the candidate who is in the lead over the Labour Day weekend normally wins the presidency. Mr Gore's advisers believe the latest figures exaggerate the Democratic candidate's national lead, but they say that their private polling shows an across-the-board shift in their fortunes in the key states where the election will be decided. Over the past 10 days, the Gore camp says, polls in 16 battleground states show Mr Gore leading in 14, tying with Mr Bush in one, and trailing in another. A month ago, Mr Gore trailed in 12 of the 16 states. Independent polling in some of the battleground states confirms the swing to Mr Gore. A new poll in Pennsylvania, a populous \"must-win\" state for the Democrats where Mr Gore trailed in July, shows Mr Gore now ahead 50% to 37% over Mr Bush. Mr Gore and his running-mate, Joe Lieberman, embarked yesterday on a non-stop 24-hour \"American workathon\" swing through several of the key states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan and Kentucky, emphasising their support for the labour movement and \"working families\". Mr Bush will also focus on the midwest battleground, starting in Illinois today, moving on to Michigan and Pennsylvania tomorrow. The Bush camp's official line is that it always expected Mr Gore to narrow the gap. But the surge towards Mr Gore - the first time at any stage of the past year that the vice-president has had more than an occasional lead over Mr Bush - has unsettled many Republicans much more than they are prepared to admit in public.",

The speech, which is seen by other senior ministers as brave in view of the dangers of a backlash from the right wing, will aim to change the philosophical debate from what one called \"the present two dimensional picture\" of immigrants versus natives.

Both ministries are acutely aware that Britain is suffering from skills shortages that could damage the economy and hold back business.

      "body": "<p>Only 11 days into the new Labour government, the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, called a press conference at the Foreign Office proudly to proclaim a new kind of foreign policy. In future there would be an ethical dimension in the conduct of foreign affairs.</p> <p>It was a radical departure. Traditionally the culture of the Foreign Office was to place national self-interest over all other considerations. Now those could be subverted to the demands of human rights.</p> <p>Mr Cook, on the left wing of the party, had been on hundreds of marches and meetings protesting about international outrages down the years that he was in opposition. He had scolded the then Conservative government over the arms-to-Iraq scandal. Now it was his turn in power, and the approach of the stuffy old Foreign Office was going to change.</p> <p>He promised that his conscience would not be parked while he was foreign secretary. He said: \"The government does not accept that political values can be left behind when we check in our passports.\"</p> <p>Unfortunately, all his good intentions lasted only a further 77 days, when he admitted that he was reluctantly giving the go-ahead for the sale of Hawk jets, armoured cars and water cannon to the repressive Indonesian regime.</p> <p>That caused an outcry that turned into a shrill blast when Hawk jets, billed as being exported only for training, were spotted flying over East Timor as the Indonesian army tried to quell the independence movement. The Portuguese prime minister, Antonio Guterres, phoned Tony Blair to protest.</p> <p>Mr Cook became defensive, retreating into semantics. He said he had never promised to conduct an ethical foreign policy, but had pledged only to ensure there would be an \"ethical dimension\" in decision-making. Downing Street did not like the headlines, which played badly with Labour's traditional constituency. International human rights groups, such as Amnesty International, as well as campaigners against the arms trade, were prepared - as they still are - to give Mr Cook the benefit of the doubt. They did not like a lot of what he was doing, but at least he was trying.</p> <p>Mr Cook was to become increasingly frustrated in his efforts. Inside the Foreign Office the idea of an ethical foreign policy had not won universal support.

      "bodyText": "Only 11 days into the new Labour government, the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, called a press conference at the Foreign Office proudly to proclaim a new kind of foreign policy. In future there would be an ethical dimension in the conduct of foreign affairs. It was a radical departure. Traditionally the culture of the Foreign Office was to place national self-interest over all other considerations. Now those could be subverted to the demands of human rights. Mr Cook, on the left wing of the party, had been on hundreds of marches and meetings protesting about international outrages down the years that he was in opposition. He had scolded the then Conservative government over the arms-to-Iraq scandal. Now it was his turn in power, and the approach of the stuffy old Foreign Office was going to change. He promised that his conscience would not be parked while he was foreign secretary. He said: \"The government does not accept that political values can be left behind when we check in our passports.\" Unfortunately, all his good intentions lasted only a further 77 days, when he admitted that he was reluctantly giving the go-ahead for the sale of Hawk jets, armoured cars and water cannon to the repressive Indonesian regime. That caused an outcry that turned into a shrill blast when Hawk jets, billed as being exported only for training, were spotted flying over East Timor as the Indonesian army tried to quell the independence movement. The Portuguese prime minister, Antonio Guterres, phoned Tony Blair to protest. Mr Cook became defensive, retreating into semantics. He said he had never promised to conduct an ethical foreign policy, but had pledged only to ensure there would be an \"ethical dimension\" in decision-making. Downing Street did not like the headlines, which played badly with Labour's traditional constituency. International human rights groups, such as Amnesty International, as well as campaigners against the arms trade, were prepared - as they still are - to give Mr Cook the benefit of the doubt. They did not like a lot of what he was doing, but at least he was trying. Mr Cook was to become increasingly frustrated in his efforts. Inside the Foreign Office the idea of an ethical foreign policy had not won universal support. There were signs all this year that it was on its last legs. When he sat down with ministerial colleagues and others to formulate foreign policy for the next general election, one thing was clear: the price of trying to follow an ethical one had become politically too high. The biggest problem for Mr Cook was that his attempts to stem unethical arms sales were repeatedly blocked by the Ministry of Defence and the Department of Trade and Industry. Mr Blair, called in to adjudicate, came down on the side of the arms industry. In January Mr Cook lost out in an internal battle over maintaining an arms embargo on the military junta in Pakistan and then a month later over providing spare parts for Hawk jets for use by Zimbabwe in the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter was justified in terms of Britain having to honour contract commitments entered into by the Conservative government. It was the same argument as put forward in the row over Hawk jets to Indonesia, when Mr Cook had said: \"It is not practical to backdate these new criteria to apply to decisions on licences already taken by the previous administration.\" The extent to which Labour was distancing itself from its ethical foreign policy became public when Mr Cook's deputy, Peter Hain, in an interview with the New Statesman magazine in April, hinted that perhaps it had been a mistake. Mr Hain said: \"I think, if there was a mistake made, it was in allowing the policy [on the ethical dimension] to be presented as if we could have perfection. The phrase 'ethical foreign policy' was never used - it was 'ethical dimension'. But in a sense it was a hook on which we found ourselves, and I think it obscured the very big advances we have made.\" On the plus side Mr Cook has accumulated a lot of credit, having pushed along the EU code of conduct on arms sales and introduced at least some transparency into British arms exports by publishing annual reports. This year's report shows that Britain continues to sell to countries with poor human rights records, such as Saudi Arabia and China. The problem the government faces is that too much credence continues to be given to the defence industry in the belief that lots of jobs are dependent upon it. The MoD puts the number of jobs reliant on exports at 40,000. Defence academics regard this as an exaggeration.

      "body": "<p>The Kosovo war was the last European war of the 20th century, and Nato's first. What do we know about it a year later? Was the Nato action a \"humanitarian intervention\", as its advocates maintained? The answer partly depends on whether there was a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo on March 23, 1999, the day before the bombing began.</p> <p>\"Yes,\" say supporters of the action. There was still a humanitarian disaster left over from the previous year. Milosevic had begun a new wave of ethnic cleansing before Nato started bombing. German intelligence claimed to have evidence of a Serbian \"Operation Horseshoe\" initiated already in late February, designed to clear a horseshoe-shaped swathe of Kosovo.</p> <p>\"No,\" say its critics. It was the bombing that caused the mass expulsions. To adapt Karl Kraus's famous remark about psychiatry, Nato's action was the disease for which it claimed to be the cure.</p> <p>The truth is more complicated than either position. Anyone who was in Kosovo, as I was, in the winter of 1998-1999 could see that there was a humanitarian disaster. Most of the 300,000 homeless had found some rudimentary shelter, but their houses were often destroyed, their wells poisoned, and they had no means of livelihood. Moreover, in February and March of 1999 the Serbs were pouring forces back into Kosovo. Whether or not there was an actual plan called \"Operation Horseshoe\", there clearly was some operational planning for large-scale expulsions, otherwise they could not have been implemented so quickly. Serb forces started systematic cleansing as the Kosovo Verification Mission pulled out, just before the bombing started.</p> <p>However, this last month of preparations and actions could be interpreted as anticipation of the bombing that would follow from Milosevic's rejection of an unacceptable agreement. One of the sources quoted by Tim Judah in his book Kosovo: War and Revenge (Yale University Press) summarises the attitude of Serbian security forces crudely but effectively: \"We'll fuck'em if they start!\" There is no question that as soon as the bombing did start the ethnic cleansing was accelerated - a word used by General Naumann. Yet, I repeat, a humanitarian disaster was already there. In early 1999 the balance of probability was that, absent further decisive action by the West, the Albanian-Serb conflict on the ground would again have escalated to produce a still worse humanitarian crisis in the spring and summer of 1999. It is, however, a basic rule of historical logic that one can never state with certainty \"what would have happened if... \"</p> <p>There is no reason to doubt that Western leaders were concerned about this real human suffering. However, as politicians they were undoubtedly more concerned about the human suffering of the Kosovar Albanians than they were about that of the Congolese, Angolans, Sierra Leoneans, Rwandans, or Colombians, because television and the press covered Kosovo more intensely and graphically, with energetic commentaries from what one British minister sarcastically called the \"something-must-be-done brigade\". So this was also a war for which the mass media were implicitly and explicitly making a case.</p> <p>Furthermore, western European leaders stressed the motive of averting \"humanitarian disaster\" so strongly because this was the only way in which taking military action without the sanction of a UN security council resolution - something they had recoiled from doing for the best part of a year - might possibly be justified in international law. This legal expedient had been suggested by a British foreign office memorandum circulated to Britain's Nato allies as early as October 1998. Yet the Foreign Affairs Committee concludes that the operation was at best of \"dubious\" legality. For legal and political reasons, it was never called a war. In his book Virtual War: Kosovo and Beyond (Metropolitan Books) Michael Ignatieff quotes Anthony Cordesman's wry conclusion: \"One of the lessons of modern war is that war can no longer be called war.\"</p> <p>In sum, it is more accurate to say that the Nato action started as a piece of coercive diplomacy. It was designed to compel Milosevic to agree to a political settlement involving far-reaching autonomy for Kosovo. One major motive for desiring such a political settlement was humanitarian concern, but equally important was a longstanding fear for the \"stability\" of the region. Since 1992 Nato's nightmare had been that a conflict involving Albanians would tear apart Macedonia, with its large Albanian minority, bringing in Bulgaria and Nato members Greece and Turkey. Western European countries were also worried about a new influx of refugees. Finally, after so many empty threats and called bluffs, Nato leaders felt the alliance had to act to preserve its own credibility as its 50th anniversary approached.</p> <p>The first six weeks of the war hardly enhanced Nato's credibility. It is a remarkable fact that for at least a month the most powerful military alliance in history, with member states representing some two thirds of the world's economic and military strength, with four million men and women under arms, and combined defence spending of around $450bn, seemed to be losing to a small, impoverished Balkan country with a defense budget of scarcely $1.5bn and about 110,000 active-duty soldiers.</p> <p>Why did Goliath do so badly? First, because he misjudged his opponent. Second, because he fought with one arm tied behind his back, most of his weapons stuck in the sand, and several large men tugging at his belt in different directions. The misjudgment was twofold: thinking Milosevic would cave in much sooner than he did and not anticipating the speed, scale and brutality of the mass expulsions.</p> <p>Policymakers interviewed today tell you that of course they knew, privately, that it could be a long haul. Cross-questioned on American television the night the bombing started, Madeleine Albright said, \"I don't see this as a long-term operation. I think that this is something... that is achievable within a relatively short period of time.\" Note the word \"relatively\", her former spokesman James Rubin told me, when I recently talked to him. Politicians, so the argument made by Rubin and others runs, could not say publicly all that they thought privately, for fear of alienating the two big Cs: the US Congress and the Coalition. Congressional doubters, Greek, Italian and German allies, simply could not be \"brought on board\" if told the truth - that this might be a long war. Let alone that it might be a ground war.</p> <p>These retrospective claims are impossible to test, because we don't have the records of top-level secret meetings at which such private farsightedness might have been articulated. It is clearly true that the two big-C constituencies had to be coaxed along gently. Yet a strong dose of scepticism is in order. Not only do most observers who were there at the time testify that Western leaders seemed convinced that it would be over quickly. More important, senior Nato commanders say they were instructed accordingly.</p> <p>Thus, for example, the plain-speaking American commander of allied air forces, General Michael Short: \"I can't tell you how many times the instruction I got was, 'Mike, you're only going to be allowed to bomb two, maybe three nights. That's all Washington can stand. That's all some members of the alliance can stand. That's why you've only got 90 targets. This'll be over in three nights.'\"</p> <p>According to a New York Times investigation, when the bombing began on March 24 Nato had a total of 219 targets prepared - enough for less than a week. Nato's commander of southern forces, Admiral James Ellis, later observed, \"We called this one absolutely wrong.\" It's one thing for politicians not to have told their publics that they privately judged this might be a long, difficult war. Politics means being economical with the truth. But what are we to conclude if they didn't even tell their own military?</p> <p>Moreover, no western leader claims that he or she anticipated Milosevic's immediate mass expulsions. According to Ignatieff, General Wesley Clark's \"intelligence people\" had anticipated up to 200,000 new Kosovar refugees. Within a month, there were some 850,000. To those who had dealt closely with Milosevic, this response was not \"impossible to predict\". Both President Kucan of Slovenia and President Gligorov of Macedonia warned of the danger. But had we not ourselves dealt closely with Milosevic?</p> <p>So there was a failure of Western political intelligence, with both a large and a small I. For the large I: astonishingly, the Defence Intelligence Agency did not even include Kosovo in its February 1999 survey of world trouble spots. The CIA's signal contribution was to suggest the Chinese embassy as a bombing target, believing it to be the headquarters of Yugoslavia's Federal Directorate of Supply and Procurement. (This was the only target proposed by the CIA.) For the small i: Western leaders, trying to prevent \"another Bosnia,\" learned a wrong lesson from Bosnia. They thought Milosevic had been bombed into accepting the Dayton agreement in 1995. They forgot that it had first required a large ground offensive - by Croatian troops.</p> <p>Another mistake was to suggest that the high-altitude bombing campaign, prescribed by the American obsession with \"zero casualties\", could stop ethnic cleansing on the ground. One of the goals President Clinton proclaimed in his television address at the beginning of the war was \"to deter an even bloodier offensive against innocent civilians in Kosovo\". The bombing campaign did something very close to the opposite. In fact, there were two parallel but largely separate campaigns: the tactical one, aimed at preventing Serbian forces in Kosovo from doing further harm to the Albanians, and the strategic one, aimed at Serbia proper. Nato won the second, but lost the first.</p> <p>A combination of weather, peasant cunning and low-tech diversions confounded Nato's multibillion dollar high-tech weapons, as they tried to find and destroy Serbian armor in Kosovo. It turns out that laser-guided bombs are very difficult to use through clouds. Kosovo in spring is cloudy. Sophisticated cruise missiles home in on the radar of air defense systems. So the Serbs turned on the radar for a few seconds, then turned it off - and those poor, disoriented missiles wandered off into Bulgaria. One landed in a bathroom in Sofia. The Serbs built decoy bridges out of plastic; Nato knocked them down. The Serbs set up woodburning stoves, with their chimneys angled to look like gun barrels; Nato took them out with exquisite accuracy. The Serbs put painted logs on the backs of trucks; Nato obliged again. At the end of the war, Nato claimed that it had destroyed some 120 Serbian tanks, 220 armored personnel carriers, and 450 artillery and mortar pieces. But the Serbian armoured columns that withdrew from Kosovo looked in remarkably good shape. according to a suppressed US Air Force report obtained by Newsweek, Nato verifiably destroyed just 14 tanks, 18 armored personnel carriers, and 20 artillery pieces. Even if the real figures are higher than that, it is an indisputable fact that ethnic cleansing increased under the bombing. As Tim Judah observes, the main weapon of ethnic cleansing is the cigarette lighter (to set fire to houses). How many cigarette lighters can you hit from 15,000 feet?</p> <p>Of course, nothing ever goes according to plan in the fog of war. It was always hubris to believe that high-tech wars would be different. But the war Nato lost in Kosovo was not just about the humbling of high-tech hubris. It was also about the mismatch between political ends and military means. Yet the military means were themselves prescribed (and proscribed) by the politics of democratic coalition warfare.</p> <p>Why did Milosevic finally cave in? Once again: we really don't know what made the difference to that poisoned but calculating mind. Perhaps it was the fact that his wife, Mira, whom everyone agrees has enormous influence over him, got weepy at the bombing of their Belgrade house? Or was it his business cronies, worried that the West was now targeting their foreign bank accounts?</p> <p>We can point to a number of things that happened shortly before he conceded, but the direct causal connection is nowhere established. For example, on May 27 he was indicted for atrocities in Kosovo by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague. Many of us thought this could make ending the war more difficult, since he might feel that he had nothing to lose. But just a week later he accepted the peace terms dictated by the European emissary, Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, and the Russian emissary Viktor Chernomyrdin. Now some say: \"Ah, he settled because he knew that anything else would bring him one step closer to the Hague.\" But who knows?</p> <p>A plausible speculation would point to four main factors. First, Milosevic had thought the Nato coalition would crumble. Instead, it held, and grew stronger after the 50th- anniversary summit in Washington in late April.</p> <p>One of the main reasons for this growing solidity of the coalition was popular outrage at the television and newspaper pictures of the Kosovar Albanian expellees, and especially at those scenes - described with wearisome predictability as \"biblical\" - of the huddled masses in a field at Blace, on the border with Macedonia. These images outweighed the negative impact of Nato's killing of civilians, either through pilot error (the train on a bridge, the refugee convoy), or mistaken targeting (the Chinese embassy), or the deliberate acceptance of civilian casualties (the Serbian television station). There are multiple ironies here. Perhaps Nato's greatest miscalculation was not to anticipate Milosevic's swift and brutal expulsion of the Kosovars. But, as it turned out, that was Milosevic's greatest mistake. Would the coalition have held through 78 days of bombing if Milosevic had just hunkered down and said, \"Here we are, poor innocent victims, a sovereign country being attacked without any good cause or UN Security Council resolution.\"? One may reasonably doubt it. So Milosevic saved the Nato coalition. Secondly, Nato did what General Short had been urging it do since the very beginning of the war: it went \"for the head of the snake\". Crucially, the bombers started destroying Belgrade's electrical power grids. Not just disabling them for a few hours with graphite bombs, as they had earlier done, but demolishing them. This damaged Milosevic's central command and control system, and the morale of his population. It also meant that patients on life-support systems and babies in hospital incubators had their power cut off.</p> <p>Thirdly, the alliance was at last moving toward a credible threat of ground invasion, as Britain had been suggesting from early in the war. Clinton's initial television address on March 24 contained the following sentence, written by his national security adviser, Samuel Berger: \"But I do not intend to put our troops in Kosovo to fight a war.\" Berger has subsequently maintained that: \"We would not have won the war without this sentence.\" The US Congress and coalition partners such as Germany would have revolted. Yet by May, the same Clinton and Berger were deliberately saying that no option was ruled out. On May 20, General Clark briefed Clinton on possible timetables for a ground invasion, and on May 21 Clinton publicly suggested increas ing the deployment of Nato troops around Kosovo - ostensibly still for a peacekeeping force - to 50,000. Nato forces began building up a road to take heavy armor through Albania to the Kosovo border.</p> <p>Finally, Russian emissaries told Milosevic that the deal he was offered was the best he could get. Russia would back him no further. This was said publicly by Chernomyrdin - whom the US had deliberately briefed about its ground invasion plans. The message was also reinforced privately, in a communication from the Russian military and security establishment, brought to Milosevic by a Swedish businessman named Peter Castenfelt. The change in the Russian position must have been a major blow to Milosevic. It was, as the Yugoslav foreign minister tells Judah with most un-Serbian understatement, \"I must admit, very relevant\". To give credit where due: bringing Russia into the coalition to put more pressure on Milosevic was a characteristic achievement of the Clinton administration.</p> <p>Thus, in the end, and at vast cost, Nato won the larger war for Kosovo.</p> <p>And the consequences? It really is too soon to say. Kosovo today is liberated - and an almighty mess. Western leaders failed to prepare for peace, as they had failed to prepare for war. Crucially, the UN administration in Kosovo was not provided with the police, judges, and jailers to establish the first prerequisite of any functioning state or protectorate: an effective monopoly of legitimate violence. Anyone who thought that because the Kosovar Albanians had long been victims they were therefore \"the good guys\" has received a sobering lesson, as Kosovars have conducted reverse ethnic cleansing of the Serbs - under the noses of Nato troops. But how it turns out in the end is still a matter of human choice.</p> <p>As for Serbia proper, the question at the war's end was: will Milosevic prove to be Europe's Galtieri (the Argentinian president deposed after losing the Falklands war) or Europe's Saddam Hussein? At the moment, he looks more like Europe's Saddam. But although it looks unlikely, he may yet be defeated in the presidential elections on September 24 . After all, if the Kosovo war teaches us anything, it is that we should always expect surprises.</p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited version of an article that appears in the current issue of the New York Review of Books.

      "bodyText": "The Kosovo war was the last European war of the 20th century, and Nato's first. What do we know about it a year later? Was the Nato action a \"humanitarian intervention\", as its advocates maintained? The answer partly depends on whether there was a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo on March 23, 1999, the day before the bombing began. \"Yes,\" say supporters of the action. There was still a humanitarian disaster left over from the previous year. Milosevic had begun a new wave of ethnic cleansing before Nato started bombing. German intelligence claimed to have evidence of a Serbian \"Operation Horseshoe\" initiated already in late February, designed to clear a horseshoe-shaped swathe of Kosovo. \"No,\" say its critics. It was the bombing that caused the mass expulsions. To adapt Karl Kraus's famous remark about psychiatry, Nato's action was the disease for which it claimed to be the cure. The truth is more complicated than either position. Anyone who was in Kosovo, as I was, in the winter of 1998-1999 could see that there was a humanitarian disaster. Most of the 300,000 homeless had found some rudimentary shelter, but their houses were often destroyed, their wells poisoned, and they had no means of livelihood. Moreover, in February and March of 1999 the Serbs were pouring forces back into Kosovo. Whether or not there was an actual plan called \"Operation Horseshoe\", there clearly was some operational planning for large-scale expulsions, otherwise they could not have been implemented so quickly. Serb forces started systematic cleansing as the Kosovo Verification Mission pulled out, just before the bombing started. However, this last month of preparations and actions could be interpreted as anticipation of the bombing that would follow from Milosevic's rejection of an unacceptable agreement. One of the sources quoted by Tim Judah in his book Kosovo: War and Revenge (Yale University Press) summarises the attitude of Serbian security forces crudely but effectively: \"We'll fuck'em if they start!\" There is no question that as soon as the bombing did start the ethnic cleansing was accelerated - a word used by General Naumann. Yet, I repeat, a humanitarian disaster was already there. In early 1999 the balance of probability was that, absent further decisive action by the West, the Albanian-Serb conflict on the ground would again have escalated to produce a still worse humanitarian crisis in the spring and summer of 1999. It is, however, a basic rule of historical logic that one can never state with certainty \"what would have happened if... \" There is no reason to doubt that Western leaders were concerned about this real human suffering. However, as politicians they were undoubtedly more concerned about the human suffering of the Kosovar Albanians than they were about that of the Congolese, Angolans, Sierra Leoneans, Rwandans, or Colombians, because television and the press covered Kosovo more intensely and graphically, with energetic commentaries from what one British minister sarcastically called the \"something-must-be-done brigade\". So this was also a war for which the mass media were implicitly and explicitly making a case. Furthermore, western European leaders stressed the motive of averting \"humanitarian disaster\" so strongly because this was the only way in which taking military action without the sanction of a UN security council resolution - something they had recoiled from doing for the best part of a year - might possibly be justified in international law. This legal expedient had been suggested by a British foreign office memorandum circulated to Britain's Nato allies as early as October 1998. Yet the Foreign Affairs Committee concludes that the operation was at best of \"dubious\" legality. For legal and political reasons, it was never called a war. In his book Virtual War: Kosovo and Beyond (Metropolitan Books) Michael Ignatieff quotes Anthony Cordesman's wry conclusion: \"One of the lessons of modern war is that war can no longer be called war.\" In sum, it is more accurate to say that the Nato action started as a piece of coercive diplomacy. It was designed to compel Milosevic to agree to a political settlement involving far-reaching autonomy for Kosovo. One major motive for desiring such a political settlement was humanitarian concern, but equally important was a longstanding fear for the \"stability\" of the region. Since 1992 Nato's nightmare had been that a conflict involving Albanians would tear apart Macedonia, with its large Albanian minority, bringing in Bulgaria and Nato members Greece and Turkey. Western European countries were also worried about a new influx of refugees. Finally, after so many empty threats and called bluffs, Nato leaders felt the alliance had to act to preserve its own credibility as its 50th anniversary approached. The first six weeks of the war hardly enhanced Nato's credibility. It is a remarkable fact that for at least a month the most powerful military alliance in history, with member states representing some two thirds of the world's economic and military strength, with four million men and women under arms, and combined defence spending of around $450bn, seemed to be losing to a small, impoverished Balkan country with a defense budget of scarcely $1.5bn and about 110,000 active-duty soldiers. Why did Goliath do so badly? First, because he misjudged his opponent. Second, because he fought with one arm tied behind his back, most of his weapons stuck in the sand, and several large men tugging at his belt in different directions. The misjudgment was twofold: thinking Milosevic would cave in much sooner than he did and not anticipating the speed, scale and brutality of the mass expulsions. Policymakers interviewed today tell you that of course they knew, privately, that it could be a long haul. Cross-questioned on American television the night the bombing started, Madeleine Albright said, \"I don't see this as a long-term operation.

My aberrant behaviour began in the middle of last week, shortly after listening to a discussion on the Today programme. The topic was David Howell's new book on the politics of the global economy. The author's own contribution was, as you would expect, highly intelligent but totally uninspired. The international market had, he said, reduced politicians' ability to control national economies. They should, he argued, accept that truth and, instead of claiming powers which they do not possess, concentrate on creating a climate in which the people they represent gain most from the new reality.</p> <p>That proposition is so difficult to deny that, at first, I wondered what Mr Redwood - invited onto the programme to stimulate some kind of discussion - would say, in addition to \"Quite right\". I should have guessed. First he denounced the government for damaging small businesses. Then he attacked the EU for imposing unnecessary burdens on companies of every size. Lord Howell had spoken in the language of the corporate seminar. Mr Redwood sounded like a bar-parlour Young Conservative.

      "bodyText": "It is an admission which I make with some embarrassment but, confession being good for the soul, I reveal that, during the last few days, my thoughts have constantly turned to John Redwood. My aberrant behaviour began in the middle of last week, shortly after listening to a discussion on the Today programme. The topic was David Howell's new book on the politics of the global economy. The author's own contribution was, as you would expect, highly intelligent but totally uninspired. The international market had, he said, reduced politicians' ability to control national economies. They should, he argued, accept that truth and, instead of claiming powers which they do not possess, concentrate on creating a climate in which the people they represent gain most from the new reality. That proposition is so difficult to deny that, at first, I wondered what Mr Redwood - invited onto the programme to stimulate some kind of discussion - would say, in addition to \"Quite right\". I should have guessed. First he denounced the government for damaging small businesses. Then he attacked the EU for imposing unnecessary burdens on companies of every size. Lord Howell had spoken in the language of the corporate seminar. Mr Redwood sounded like a bar-parlour Young Conservative. I have no doubt that diehard Tories who were listening loved every cliche. I attributed my surprise at Mr Redwood's conduct to the early hour in which the discussion took place. Had I been fully awake I would have remembered that he always behaves in the same way.

      "body": "<p>Radiohead were always the most grown-up of the Britpop bands that kicked and screamed their way into the nation's affections in the late 1990s.</p> <p>Now, thanks to a combination of inventive songwriting and a preference for examining the human condition rather than the bottom of a pint glass, the five public schoolboys from Oxford are challenging four working class Liverpudlians for the title of greatest band of the rock'n'roll era.</p> <p>Two Radiohead albums have muscled their way into the top five of the Virgin All Time Top 1,000 Albums millennium edition, territory traditionally dominated by the Beatles. The Fab Four's 1966 Revolver tops the poll, with Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band at number three and The White Album at number five.</p> <p>Sandwiched in between, however, are Radiohead's The Bends (2) and OK Computer (4), works which have demonstrated abiding popularity at a time when Oasis, torch carriers of the Britpop scene, are rumoured to be on the verge of collapse.</p> <p>The Virgin poll of over 200,000 musicians, writers and fans was first conducted seven years ago and is now updated every three years, to reveal underlying trends in popular taste as well as separating the significant from the fleeting.</p> <p>In the last poll the Radiohead albums were at 10 and 21 respectively, while Oasis was at number nine with (What's The Story) Morning Glory. This time that album has fallen to number 21 while Be Here Now sank from 36 to 459.</p> <p>The only other band apart from the Beatles to have secured a spot in the poll's top five is Nirvana, whose first album, Nevermind, reached number four in the last poll. Radiohead's achievement will serve to heighten interest in the group's fourth album, Kid A, released next month.</p> <p>\"The rise of Radiohead is phenomenal,\" said Colin Larkin, who started the survey in 1993.</p> <p>\"No other band, not even Pink Floyd, has ever come close to giving the Fab Four a run for their money. I think we have been searching for many years for a legitimate replacement to the dinosaur bands.\"</p> <p>Radiohead aside, very few bands that rose in the 1990s make an impression in a list dominated by the music of the 1960s and 1970s. Blur's Parklife has drifted out of the top 50 in the last three years, but the Stone Roses' eponymous album (12), Portishead's Dummy (41), Definitely Maybe by Oasis (44), and Blue Lines by Massive Attack (28) preserve some dignity for the bright young(ish) things of the last decade.</p> <p>\"Radiohead have followed giants like The Beatles and Pink Floyd, moving into that status of bands who will last the course. They haven't really put a foot wrong. They are bright and have got stuck into their work and we've seen a massive influx of votes for them this time.</p> <p>\"They did well last year along with many of the other Britpop bands, but most of those have fallen by the wayside this time,\" said Mr Larkin.</p> <p>The list remains very male and very white. The top 100 contains just 13 albums by black artists, with Kind of Blue by Miles Davis the highest placed, at 12.</p> <p>The first of the eight albums by female artists on the list is Joni Mitchell's Blue, at 24. Davis matches the Beatles' 14 albums in the full list, while Bob Dylan has 13 entries, three of them in the top 100, led by Blood on the Tracks.</p> <p>Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Pink Floyd, U2 and the Rolling Stones all have three albums in the top 100, while American bands represent almost half of the top 100, with REM the highest placed at number six with Automatic for the People.</p> <p>The earliest album in the top 100 is in final place, Frank Sinatra's 1956 album Songs For Swingin' Lovers. Sinatra may have been bypassed by the rock,n,roll revolution, but he helped to make it possible.</p> <p>Pop writer Caroline Sullivan said the list revealed more about the people who voted than about the bands themselves.</p> <p>\"The fact that there isn't a single dance album in the top 25 shows who take part in these polls: white middle-aged fans, as opposed to the kids.</p> <p>\"Radiohead are a good choice if you want to seem more intelligent than you really are.\"</p> <p>She added: \"They are difficult, introspective, contemplative, and an antidote to the dance music that dominates tastes today but which a lot of people don't actually understand.\"</p> <p><b>Will we still love 'em, when they're 64?</b></p> <p><b> 1.

      "bodyText": "Radiohead were always the most grown-up of the Britpop bands that kicked and screamed their way into the nation's affections in the late 1990s. Now, thanks to a combination of inventive songwriting and a preference for examining the human condition rather than the bottom of a pint glass, the five public schoolboys from Oxford are challenging four working class Liverpudlians for the title of greatest band of the rock'n'roll era. Two Radiohead albums have muscled their way into the top five of the Virgin All Time Top 1,000 Albums millennium edition, territory traditionally dominated by the Beatles. The Fab Four's 1966 Revolver tops the poll, with Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band at number three and The White Album at number five. Sandwiched in between, however, are Radiohead's The Bends (2) and OK Computer (4), works which have demonstrated abiding popularity at a time when Oasis, torch carriers of the Britpop scene, are rumoured to be on the verge of collapse. The Virgin poll of over 200,000 musicians, writers and fans was first conducted seven years ago and is now updated every three years, to reveal underlying trends in popular taste as well as separating the significant from the fleeting. In the last poll the Radiohead albums were at 10 and 21 respectively, while Oasis was at number nine with (What's The Story) Morning Glory. This time that album has fallen to number 21 while Be Here Now sank from 36 to 459. The only other band apart from the Beatles to have secured a spot in the poll's top five is Nirvana, whose first album, Nevermind, reached number four in the last poll. Radiohead's achievement will serve to heighten interest in the group's fourth album, Kid A, released next month. \"The rise of Radiohead is phenomenal,\" said Colin Larkin, who started the survey in 1993. \"No other band, not even Pink Floyd, has ever come close to giving the Fab Four a run for their money. I think we have been searching for many years for a legitimate replacement to the dinosaur bands.\" Radiohead aside, very few bands that rose in the 1990s make an impression in a list dominated by the music of the 1960s and 1970s. Blur's Parklife has drifted out of the top 50 in the last three years, but the Stone Roses' eponymous album (12), Portishead's Dummy (41), Definitely Maybe by Oasis (44), and Blue Lines by Massive Attack (28) preserve some dignity for the bright young(ish) things of the last decade. \"Radiohead have followed giants like The Beatles and Pink Floyd, moving into that status of bands who will last the course. They haven't really put a foot wrong. They are bright and have got stuck into their work and we've seen a massive influx of votes for them this time. \"They did well last year along with many of the other Britpop bands, but most of those have fallen by the wayside this time,\" said Mr Larkin. The list remains very male and very white. The top 100 contains just 13 albums by black artists, with Kind of Blue by Miles Davis the highest placed, at 12. The first of the eight albums by female artists on the list is Joni Mitchell's Blue, at 24. Davis matches the Beatles' 14 albums in the full list, while Bob Dylan has 13 entries, three of them in the top 100, led by Blood on the Tracks. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Pink Floyd, U2 and the Rolling Stones all have three albums in the top 100, while American bands represent almost half of the top 100, with REM the highest placed at number six with Automatic for the People. The earliest album in the top 100 is in final place, Frank Sinatra's 1956 album Songs For Swingin' Lovers. Sinatra may have been bypassed by the rock,n,roll revolution, but he helped to make it possible. Pop writer Caroline Sullivan said the list revealed more about the people who voted than about the bands themselves. \"The fact that there isn't a single dance album in the top 25 shows who take part in these polls: white middle-aged fans, as opposed to the kids. \"Radiohead are a good choice if you want to seem more intelligent than you really are.\" She added: \"They are difficult, introspective, contemplative, and an antidote to the dance music that dominates tastes today but which a lot of people don't actually understand.\" Will we still love 'em, when they're 64? 1.

Since the middle of the 1990s, the US jobs machine has not depended on low wages. </p> <p>Although the US created jobs between 1979 and 1995, when the inflation-adjusted median wage fell by 7%, the jobs machine only started running in top gear after 1995. Since then, the median wage has risen by more than 7%. </p> <p>Nor has job creation at the bottom depended on falling wages. Between 1979 and 1995, the real wage for the typical low-wage job fell 17%. Unemployment, however, reached 30-year lows only after 1995, when real wages grew faster at the bottom (more than 9%) than they did at the middle (up 7%) and the top (up 6%). </p> <p>And recent US employment performance has not relied on \"contingent\" or \"non-standard\" jobs. According to US Census data, the shares of regular part-time workers, temp, on-call workers and independent contractors fell between 1995 and 1999. Many European economies already have as many or more non-standard workers than the US. </p> <p>There, about 17% of workers are part-time, compared with more than 20% in Britain and 17% in France; 2% are temps, compared with 6% in Britain and 10% in France; and only 6% are self-employed, compared with 11% in both Britain and France. </p> <p>If flexibility is not behind the boom, then what is? The simultaneous rise in employment and wages points towards macroeconomic demand. For better and for worse, three factors have been fuelling that demand. </p> <p>The first is the rise in household debt. While US politicians have focused on eliminating the national debt, US households have been amassing a mountain of private debt. Between 1995 and 1999, household debt grew from 92% to 103% of disposable income, sparking a consumer-spending spree that has boosted employment (and the trade deficit). Debt, however, cannot grow faster than income indefinitely. </p> <p>The second demand catalyst is the stock-market bubble, which has reinforced debt-financed consumer spending, particularly among the top 10% of households (which hold 85% of all shares). </p> <p>Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist James Poterba concluded that, even if households spend only three cents of every $1 increase in their share portfolios, the $6.6 trillion rise in the value of equities between 1995 and 1999 would have raised GDP by 2%. </p> <p>The final and most important demand factor is the Federal Reserve Board's de facto rejection of the economic profession's now embarrassing consensus supporting a 5.5% to 6% floor for the US unemployment rate. After recession hit in 1991, the Federal Reserve allowed real short-term interest rates to remain near zero for almost two years. When unemployment first fell below 5.5% to 6% in 1995, the Fed wisely adopted a wait-and-see attitude.

Now a new study, to be presented later this week at the British Psychological Society's conference, examines the differences between men and women in order to part the veil of tears which divides the sexes.</p> <p>The findings are the result of 30 men and 57 women being subjected to something called the Adult Crying Inventory, which sounds like a box containing pictures of dead kittens, but is in fact a detailed questionnaire about the experience of weeping. Not surprisingly, the study found marked differences in the way men and women cry. Men are more likely to cry as a result of positive feelings, while women are more likely to cry as a consequence of conflict with other people, or as a result of feeling inadequate.</p> <p>Some of the reasons for the differences are obvious. Most men have the crying habit drilled out of them at an early age by parents and peers. This may be why men consider crying in women to be a sign of weakness, or worse, manipulation. For men, crying is a debased emotional response, because we know that to some extent it can be controlled unlike say, an ulcer, or a skin rash. We believe women can turn the waterworks on and off at will, and we are jealous because we can only turn them off. Men also regard crying as essentially profitless, since it hasn't got most of us anywhere since we were seven.</p> <p>Of course the way men cry seems fairly perverse, even to men. Abstinence is the rule from about 13 to 25, leaving most of us woefully out of practice. After the age of 30 tears begin to seep out at strange and inappropriate moments. Men routinely cry at sporting events, particularly when they are happy. Grotesque nostalgia becomes one outlet. Sad and inspirational television programmes are another.</p> <p>Eventually, having children loosens some kind of screw in the male brain. Tears flow with the arrival of the firstborn and become increasingly difficult to hold at bay. Floodgates open. Fond recollection becomes dangerous territory, as does paternal pride, empathy or worrying about the future. The last time I cried was last week, while recalling my five-year-old son's unfortunate humiliation at the hands of a circus clown. The time before that was at the actual circus. The time before that, if memory serves, was during a Stars In Their Eyes final. You know how it is. They all wanted it so bad.</p> <p>The study shows that women experience more complex emotions while crying, including fear, anger, powerlessness and frustration. Few men would think of crying in response to such feelings, preferring either repressed panic or choked rage. Suffice to say it was precisely these emotions which transformed Dr Bruce Banner into the Incredible Hulk. While the differences are striking, it's fair to say that men and women have more in common than not in terms of crying. Bereavement is a great leveller, as is the pain of a troubled or snuffed-out relationship. And there is nothing to unite the sexes quite like the sudden loss of a large sum of money, or the weight of an oppressive debt. The last time my wife and I really cried together was only a few days ago, when we received that scary letter regarding the future of our endowment mortgage.</p>",

The biggest seller of stock has been Credit Suisse Asset Management.</p> <p>However, there is little sign yet of a hostile bid for the company, which makes Banks's, Pedigree and Marston's ale. Mr Breare is hoping that shareholders will exert sufficient pressure to force Wolves' management into friendly discussions.</p> <p>Mr Breare last month made a tentative offer of 500p-a-share, valuing the business at \u00a3472m. He has indicated that he is prepared to raise this to 550p. His backers are reluctant, though, to let him go hostile without access to detailed information about Wolves' pubs, which will reveal exactly how poor summer trading has been.</p> <p>Wolves' managing director David Thompson has refused to open up the company's books, saying he cannot disclose commercially sensitive data to \"every passing venture capitalist\".</p> <p>He has complained that Mr Breare has asked for unusually detailed facts - he wants to know, for example, the number of times the emergency services have had to attend incidents at each of the group's 1,700 pubs.</p> <p>Mr Breare's financial backers include Botts &amp; Co, Bank of Scotland and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. He is likely to make public his willingness to pay 550p a share. Artbitrageurs, who are buying at the current price of 510p, are likely to want more than this.</p> <p>Many Wolves shareholders are waiting for a trading update, due at the end of this month, before exerting further pressure on the company to enter takeover talks. The update will include the results of a review of the group's brewing capacity, which is likely to centre on plans to sell breweries at Mansfield and Hartlepool.</p> <p>Mr Thompson let loose his frustration with the City last week, complaining that the recent weakness in the company's shares was down to prejudice against the Midlands: \"It is easy to write off the Midlands but there is plenty of prosperity here and it is an area where people love drinking beer and going to pubs.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "American arbitrage firms have been dipping into the market for shares in Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries, placing multimillion pound bets on the company succumbing to an imminent takeover. Transatlantic raiders have bought nearly 3% of the regional beer group, which is under siege from the venture capital-backed entrepreneur Robert Breare. The biggest seller of stock has been Credit Suisse Asset Management. However, there is little sign yet of a hostile bid for the company, which makes Banks's, Pedigree and Marston's ale. Mr Breare is hoping that shareholders will exert sufficient pressure to force Wolves' management into friendly discussions. Mr Breare last month made a tentative offer of 500p-a-share, valuing the business at \u00a3472m. He has indicated that he is prepared to raise this to 550p. His backers are reluctant, though, to let him go hostile without access to detailed information about Wolves' pubs, which will reveal exactly how poor summer trading has been. Wolves' managing director David Thompson has refused to open up the company's books, saying he cannot disclose commercially sensitive data to \"every passing venture capitalist\". He has complained that Mr Breare has asked for unusually detailed facts - he wants to know, for example, the number of times the emergency services have had to attend incidents at each of the group's 1,700 pubs. Mr Breare's financial backers include Botts &amp; Co, Bank of Scotland and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. He is likely to make public his willingness to pay 550p a share. Artbitrageurs, who are buying at the current price of 510p, are likely to want more than this. Many Wolves shareholders are waiting for a trading update, due at the end of this month, before exerting further pressure on the company to enter takeover talks. The update will include the results of a review of the group's brewing capacity, which is likely to centre on plans to sell breweries at Mansfield and Hartlepool. Mr Thompson let loose his frustration with the City last week, complaining that the recent weakness in the company's shares was down to prejudice against the Midlands: \"It is easy to write off the Midlands but there is plenty of prosperity here and it is an area where people love drinking beer and going to pubs.\"",

Mutual domesticity has been universally regarded as a statement of commitment, an inevitable step in a serious relationship.</p> <p>But according to Jan Trost, a sociologist at the University of Uppsala in Sweden, a growing number of couples are opting out of moving in together. \"Living apart together\", as he calls it, is already a recognised phenomenon across Europe, where it's well-known by the acronym \"lat\". While there are no figures for Britain, the growing number of single-person households - currently 16% in England and Wales, with a projection of almost 50% by 2010 - suggests that many will be committed couples who choose not to share their space.</p> <p>Living apart can be the involuntary consequence of having high-flying careers, like the banking couple I know whose jobs have taken him to London and her to Zurich. They see each other at weekends, and admit it's less than ideal. But living separately is also an increasingly viable choice for people in the same city who simply don't want to explore the netherworld of shared toothpaste. Writer Margaret Drabble and her husband were married for over a decade before finally moving in together - and still insist on a show of independence by occupying different floors of the same house. Woody Allen and Mia Farrow famously had apartments within sight of each other across Central Park for years.</p> <p>Living together forces a rearrangement of the mental as well as physical furniture which some just don't want to negotiate. Living apart together, on the other hand, doesn't necessarily imply lack of commitment, but instead an acknowledgment of boundaries. The Posh and Becks model of extreme interdependence (where does she end and he begin?) may be the romantic ideal, but those who have opted for autonomy can't praise it enough.</p> <p>\"Two people might be mad about each other, but living together doesn't always feel like a natural progression,\" observes Karen Frayn, 28, a publisher in a three-year relationship with a co-worker. \"It wouldn't exactly be unbearable being in the same living space, but I want to be able to do exactly what I want, when I want. I want to be financially autonomous, and when you're on your own you can prioritise what you do with your money.\" For her, the biggest boon is \"getting to see what I'm like. Maybe it's a control-freak thing, but if I want to do something crazy to the bathroom or something, I can. I don't want to amalgamate personalities.\"</p> <p>Her sentiments are echoed by Helen Morris, a 34-year-old nurse, who met her current boyfriend when changing careers five years ago. \"Studying for my nursing exams took up 99% of my attention, and even though I loved him I knew I had to make something of myself. It was more important to me than the relationship. So moving in has never come up. I've never wanted to get married or have kids, so this is perfect for me.\"</p> <p>She admits that living together would be practical, as she's in a cramped studio flat and he owns a large house, but can't bring herself to compromise. \"I wouldn't want to have someone else's things around the house, and I can't bear anyone telling me how to live. People think that by living together they're going to be secure because someone's there looking after them, but it doesn't work that way.\"</p> <p>Denise Knowles of Relate, predicts that separate establishments will become increasingly common as women gain financial independence and have less incentive to split the rent. \"Women are putting more time and energy into business and haven't got as much energy to put into the domestic side. So they live alone, and when they do see their partner it's special.\"</p> <p>As a teenager, living with someone was a milestone that ranked up there with leaving home, and I couldn't wait to have a go. Any hygienic male would have done, but fortunately the first person to suggest it was someone I actually wanted to live with. But within a week of installing myself in his junior-sized flat, we knew it was a mistake. Cramming two adults plus assorted junk into three tiny rooms, though we persevered for a year, ruined the relationship.</p> <p>I've never tried it again. When another boyfriend suggested buying a place together a few years later, I was enticed by the idea of coming home to someone who knew me well, but realised I needed not just Virginia Woolf's room of one's own, but a whole flat. We ended up living separately for all our six years together, and I'd recommend it to anyone. You enjoy the pleasures of commitment without the boredom and bickering over bills, and if it ends, there's none of the trauma of buying each other out or splitting up possessions.</p> <p>This alternative to cohabitation also avoids what sociologist Patricia Morgan calls the \"rotten deal\" women get out of cohabiting. Her book, Marriage Lite, published last month, argues that living together without marriage is financially and emotionally disadvantageous for women - though she's not totally sold on living apart, either. \"You might get a better deal out of keeping your own home, I suppose,\" she concedes. \"It's like the aristocrats of the past, occupying separate wings. You'd get some of the advantages of marriage, but is it really commitment?\"</p> <p>My former boyfriend now wonders the same thing. \"If you don't live with someone, it makes the long-term prognosis less secure,\" he says. \"Living together means you might lose out on the thrill you feel when you only see someone occasionally, but you gain by getting to know each other better and having greater expectations for the relationship.\" It seems to be men rather than women who want the security of a shared address. \"Well, you do expect at some stage to live together, or you might live alone for the rest of your life,\" he says.</p> <p>It's a hard one to get right, as wanting separate places can be taken as a rejection.

      "bodyText": "Nestling deep in the sun belt of the south, Austin is booming. The Texas state capital is light on regulation, light on tax and, according to Forbes magazine, one of the best cities in the US in which to do business. One of the titans of the new global economy - Dell computers - has its headquarters in the city. It is this side of the Texan economy that George W Bush will be seeking to exploit in this his campaign. He would like to convince voters that the whopping increases in real incomes enjoyed by workers in the computer sector are the result of his hands-off economic management of the state. Since he became governor, 1m new jobs and almost 50,000 new businesses have been created. However, as with the US economy as a whole, there is another side to the story. Texas may be one of the handful of states not to levy its own income tax in addition to the federal income tax, but it has also seen a marked increase in inequality and poverty under Mr Bush. In 1990 it was ranked by the census bureau as the eighth poorest state; the latest figures show that it is now the fifth poorest, with only Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and West Virginia ranked lower. Mr Bush's supporters argue that he has made a success of welfare-to-work policies; critics say that the emphasis on pushing people into low-paid jobs has left education and training neglected. Despite the presence of world-beating companies such as Dell, Texas produces fewer scientists and engineers than the average state, and ranks 48th in basic literacy. One of Mr Bush's main policies in the election is his tax-cutting plan to help ordinary working families, working mothers and other low-income Americans. The Democrats say that the governor's record in his home state has been one of failure, leaving low-income Texans worse off than working families in other states. In 1998 Texas ranked 50th -last - in the union for women without health insurance and 43rd for women living in poverty. Almost 18% of Texan working parents had low earnings - defined as too meagre to lift a family of four out of poverty despite full time work - and Texas ranks third in the US in hunger. The environmental impact of Mr Bush's economic policies are likely to become a campaign issue. Houston has become the smog capital of the US, and the Republican presidential candidate has removed restrictions on development in Texas, opposes any curbs on trade in genetically modified food, and would completely repudiate the aims of the Kyoto climate agreement. Texas facts : \u0095 Unemployment rate 4.5% \u0095 48,000 new businesses created under Bush \u0095 Almost \u00a33bn in tax cuts \u0095 Fifth largest proportion in US of population living in poverty \u0095 25%of Texan children (1.4m) lack health insurance",

      "bodyText": "A leading figure in Germany's Christian Democrats faced pressure to resign yesterday amid fresh corruption charges alleging that the opposition party had accepted an illegal \u00a3140,000 payment from big business. Roland Koch, the rightwing prime minister of the central state of Hesse, was accused in two media reports of accepting the donation from the German Industry Insurance Association (HDI), which allegedly paid the cash to a political academy to avoid detection. Another report by Hesse radio accused Mr Koch of running an illicit bank account to store illegal donations to the party. Yesterday Mr Koch denied the reports and insisted that the HDI payments to the Hesse Academy for Political Education had not been used by the CDU for electioneering or other political purposes. \"The academy is not a money-laundering machine,\" he said However an HDI spokesman confirmed that the payment was intended as financial backing for Mr Koch: \"We wanted to support Mr Koch's work, but we did not want to make unfocused payments into CDU party accounts,\" he said. The spokesman denied that the donation was illegal. In response to the latest in a series of corruption allegations levelled at Germany's main conservative party since November, the Social Democratic (SPD) chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, said: \"A fish stinks at the head. The CDU is dragging its feet in clearing up the mire caused by its illegal party funding arrangements.\" Other SPD and Green party politicans in the government coalition demanded Mr Koch's immediate resignation. \"Koch's credibility is shattered,\" the finance minister, Hans Eichel, said yesterday. The allegations appeared certain to accelerate the decline of the CDU's popularity. Last year the party elected an east German politican, Angela Merkel, as leader to try to lessen the damage caused by the corruption scandal surrounding former Chancellor Helmut Kohl. However, an opinion poll broadcast at the weekend by ZDF television showed that the CDU was almost 10 percentage points behind the government coalition. Meanwhile, Ms Merkel joined colleagues and industry leaders yesterday in blaming Mr Schr\u00f6der's government for the decline of the euro. \"The government has been either playing down or staying silent about the continuing weakness of the euro,\" Ms Merkel told the newspaper Welt am Sonntag. She said the currency's weakness was caused by the failure of EU member states, including Germany, to make radical economic reforms.",

In an interview which will anger countries such as Poland who are anxious to join the EU as soon as possible, the EU's enlargement commissioner G\u00fcnter Verheugen said that a referendum should be held in Germany to ensure that the public there are not presented with a \"fait accompli\".

Germany should not, he stressed, make the same mistake with enlargement as it had with the single currency. His comments, reported in Saturday's S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, prompted his boss Romano Prodi, the EC president, to demand an explanation. Mr Prodi promised to \"clarify\" what he described as \"a small misunderstanding\" in the coming days. Mr Verheugen was also criticised by the French, German and Finnish foreign ministers although his own spokesman later claimed that he had only been expressing his personal views and was not seeking to delay enlargement. EU commissioners traditionally refrain from speaking so openly about their home countries but Mr Verheugen even went so far as to suggest that German fears about an influx of cheap labour and a crime wave as a result of enlargement were \"valid\". Several EU foreign ministers, attending an informal meeting in France, spoke darkly about a plot by Berlin to delay expansion and suggested that Mr Verheugen was taking orders from the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.

      "body": "<p>For all the commonly accepted signs of ageing - policemen looking young, more frequent urination, finding pop music incomprehensible - one of the most poignant is the moment when television history documentaries start featuring scenes you saw at the time they occurred. </p> <p>Reputations - The Secret Life Of Richard Nixon deals with a figure of recent enough vintage to have had a funeral address from President Clinton. And watching this two-part profile - based on a provocative new biography of Nixon by Anthony Summers, featured in this paper last Saturday - it strikes you that one of the consolations of old age will be the Reputations special on Clinton. </p> <p>These graceful compilations of archive and arthritic reminiscence are among television's most seductive forms. Although written history digs deeper psychologically than the television biography, there is one effect - that cut from the young ambitious faces on newsreel to the drained and wattled features of the elderly negotiating their place in history - for which the page has no equivalent. Shut your eyes and you can imagine the bald Lord Blair of Sedgfield remembering his times with Bill at Camp David. </p> <p>Dealing in the Year 2000 with Nixon - Clinton's only rival among modern American figures as a dramatic character and psychological case study - producer William Cran and director Guy Evans face the problem that his story has been told so often. There was a five-part TV documentary on Watergate alone; Oliver Stone made a three-hour movie. Nixon's life is at least a ten-parter. Here they have to do him in two. </p> <p>Accordingly, what results is not a primer on Nixon but a provocative epilogue to other biographies, centred on two startling claims about the President's private and public conduct respectively. </p> <p>The first contention is that the politician whose campaigns presented him as a safe pair of hands in fact possessed shaky and sweaty fingers. Where Clinton and Reagan were natural politicians - refreshed by pressure and publicity - Nixon had the terrible dichotomy of being a shy and private man who wished to run the world.

      "bodyText": "For all the commonly accepted signs of ageing - policemen looking young, more frequent urination, finding pop music incomprehensible - one of the most poignant is the moment when television history documentaries start featuring scenes you saw at the time they occurred. Reputations - The Secret Life Of Richard Nixon deals with a figure of recent enough vintage to have had a funeral address from President Clinton. And watching this two-part profile - based on a provocative new biography of Nixon by Anthony Summers, featured in this paper last Saturday - it strikes you that one of the consolations of old age will be the Reputations special on Clinton. These graceful compilations of archive and arthritic reminiscence are among television's most seductive forms. Although written history digs deeper psychologically than the television biography, there is one effect - that cut from the young ambitious faces on newsreel to the drained and wattled features of the elderly negotiating their place in history - for which the page has no equivalent. Shut your eyes and you can imagine the bald Lord Blair of Sedgfield remembering his times with Bill at Camp David. Dealing in the Year 2000 with Nixon - Clinton's only rival among modern American figures as a dramatic character and psychological case study - producer William Cran and director Guy Evans face the problem that his story has been told so often. There was a five-part TV documentary on Watergate alone; Oliver Stone made a three-hour movie. Nixon's life is at least a ten-parter. Here they have to do him in two. Accordingly, what results is not a primer on Nixon but a provocative epilogue to other biographies, centred on two startling claims about the President's private and public conduct respectively. The first contention is that the politician whose campaigns presented him as a safe pair of hands in fact possessed shaky and sweaty fingers. Where Clinton and Reagan were natural politicians - refreshed by pressure and publicity - Nixon had the terrible dichotomy of being a shy and private man who wished to run the world. An aide recalls that, even as President, he would blush when meeting strangers. And so, say these films, he sought various masks. There is first-hand evidence that he was a patient of a New York psychiatrist and regular taker of sedating medication. Hearsay allegations further suggest that he was an ugly drunk and wife-beater.

The greatest mystery of the Watergate burglary was always why a President certain to be re-elected was so interested in files kept by his Democrat rivals.

This is tragedy and farce. </p> <p>Even so, it would be unwise to demean the Soviet achievement. Soviet architecture continues to inform the designs of some of the world's most intelligent and adventurous architects. Look at Daniel Libeskind's iconoclastic design for the Spiral wing of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, or Zaha Hadid's up-and-coming Museum of Comtemporary Art in Rome. Look back half a century, and you'll find that the design of London's Royal Festival Hall is based in part on a Moscow concert hall of the early 1930s. </p> <p>The list of Soviet-inspired buildings in decidedly non-revolutionary Britain is as long as the Ostankino Tower was tall. Modern Movement architecture, as it arrived in Britain on the boat from continental Europe, was a fusion of ideas that had criss-crossed somewhere on the way from Moscow through Berlin and Paris. Some of the architects themselves came here, too. The most celebrated practitioner was Berthold Lubetkin (1901-90), a Georgian educated in Moscow, who brought with him an elegance of style, a sharp intellect and the labyrinthine emotional depths of the land of Dostoevsky. He designed the Penguin Pool (1934) at London Zoo - a modest proposition, yet in Lubetkin's hands one of the iconic international designs of the 1930s. Its swirling helical ramps and graphic impact call to mind the spirit that electrified such pacemaking Bolshevik designs as the vertiginous steel spiral Monument to the Third Communist International (1919) by the artist Vladimir Tatlin (1885-1953). </p> <p>Not far from London Zoo are the Isokon flats in Hampstead (1934), an experiment in collective housing designed for left-wing intellectuals by the journalist-turned-architect Wells Coates. Complete with a club room designed by the Bauhaus emigre Marcel Breuer, the Isokon building was modelled on the Moscow housing block built for employees of the Finance Commisariat designed by Moisei Ginzburg (1892-1946). This ocean-liner housing was to inspire Le Corbusier, whose ideas on urban mass housing and, later, his Unite d'Habitation in Marseilles (1946-52), were to have a profound influence on social housing around the world. </p> <p>Le Corbusier, like many progressive architects of the 1920s and 30s, visited Soviet Russia; he designed the Tsentrosoyuz office building (1928-36) in Moscow, and was one of the many international architects who entered the competition for Stalin's new Palace of the Soviets held between 1931 and 1933. The palace was never built - which was just as well, since the winning design was for an abomination of a building, capped with a 300ft statue of Lenin. </p> <p>The sheer inventiveness of the architects of the early \"heroic\" Soviet era, between the end of the first world war and 1932, remains both remarkable and a visual treat. It was a brief flowering, yet it sowed its seeds internationally. How did such an extraordinary architecture emerge? After the fall of the Romanovs in 1917 and the German surrender a year later, there was an outburst of can-do passion and energy and much the same sort of feeling that must have been experienced in Paris in 1789: with the old order turned upside down, anything could happen. </p> <p>The work of Soviet Modernists was characterised by a love of breaking the grid of conventional buildings, by the intrusion of sudden diagonal or spiralling elements, by a daring use of giant, sloganeering graphics, by dramatic intersections and even collisions of the various parts of wilfully abstract buildings. This was architecture as Soviet propaganda for liberation from bourgeois norms, a way of building as shocking at the time as the new wave of Soviet cinema and graphic design. </p> <p>The first physical expression most foreigners saw of this new spirit was the Soviet pavilion at the 1925 Art Deco exhibition held in Paris. Designed by Konstantin Melnikov (1890-1974), this was a cleverly deconstructed red, black and grey timber box shot through with an inside-outside diagonal stair. The entrance was topped with a hammer-and-sickle motif. Melnikov went on to build the only private house allowed in Moscow at the time. This was his own home and studio (1927-9), a curious circular concrete tower pierced with elongated honeycomb pattern windows. It survives; the architect's son lives there today. </p> <p>More importantly, Melnikov was responsible for the development of a series of distinctive workers' clubs for political education and training in Moscow. His aggressive Rusakov Club (1927-9) for employees of the Moscow City Soviet, and the brilliant geometric play that is the Zuev Club (1927-9) for Moscow's tram workers, designed by Ilia Golosov (1883-1945), set a new standard for public buildings. Which city now would commission such radical and intelligent architecture for workers? Certainly not today's dizzy, disco- and dollar-crazy Moscow. </p> <p>Radical designs just made it into the 1930s before Stalin squeezed the country in his lethal bear hug. He imposed his school of Socialist Realism in architecture - as in music, art and literature - by decree in 1932; individual architectural practices were abolished and all work was to be organised through the Union of Soviet Architects. The revolutionary dream was officially over. </p> <p>Of course, many exuberant, if bombastic, buildings were constructed between 1932 and Stalin's death 21 years later: the Moscow Metro, richer than any babushka's plum cake; the seven wedding-cake towers encircling Moscow's city centre; the grand apartment blocks of Moscow, Leningrad and Stalingrad (the last obliterated during the Great Patriotic War of 1941-5). The breathtaking Lomonosov State University complex of the early 1950s was designed by a team led by Lev Rudnev (1885-1956); previously he had also designed the daunting Frunze Military Academy (1937), Moscow, to symbolise the might, real or not at the time, of the Red Army. </p> <p>Almost all of these buildings, Constructivist or Classical, Suprematist or Stalinist, are still standing. They should remind us not just that the former Soviet Union is not as crumbly as so many like to believe this disastrous summer, but that it once challenged the world with its revolutionary architecture.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Opera North may have had a bit of their thunder stolen by Garsington, which included Schumann's only opera in its country-house season in June, but their new production of Genoveva - conducted by Steven Sloane, directed by David Pountney, and almost certainly the first by a permanent British company since the 19th century - is still a major achievement of which everyone involved with this production, at the King's Theatre, Edinburgh, can be very proud. Those of us who have long thought the work unjustly neglected can feel vindicated, too, while those detractors - who have condemned as perversely anti-operatic Schumann's treatment of this story of love cruelly deceived but ultimately redeemed - now have the perfect opportunity to revise their opinion. </p> <p>That's not to claim Genoveva is a flawless masterpiece: it's neither flawless nor, quite, a masterpiece. But it's a totally absorbing and at times dramatically gripping work, with a score that contains a great deal of top-drawer music, even if some of the choral writing is weak and there are moments when Schumann's determination to be understated and not write a no-holds-barred Weber-style opera of the kind so fashionable in Germany in the 1840s causes the dramatic pacing to falter. </p> <p>The libretto is the composer's own, a sometimes rather uneasy marriage of two literary treatments, by Hebbel and Tieck, of the legend of Genevieve of Brabant. Genoveva's husband, Siegfried, goes off to fight a holy war against the Moors, entrusting his wife to the safe-keeping of his best friend, Golo. When Golo's own advances on Genoveva are rebuffed, he engineers accusations of adultery against her, and when Siegfried returns from routing the infidels, he furiously condemns her to death. But Genoveva's Christian faith protects her from execution until her husband discovers the truth, and the couple can live happily ever after in religious and marital bliss. </p> <p>Psychologically, Golo is the lynch-pin of the opera, a tragic angst-ridden figure torn between his lust for Genoveva and his loyalty to Siegfried, while the snow-white heroine herself is almost a cipher, a blank sheet - save for her religious faith - on to which the men around her can project their fantasies. Her dark opposite is Margaretha, the witch who manipulates Golo and plots the downfall of Siegfried and his kingdom, in just the way that Morgan Le Fay pulls the strings in the court of King Arthur; Schumann intended to write an Arthurian opera and only abandoned the idea when he heard of Wagner's plans for Lohengrin. But in a curious way Genoveva is precisely that work transplanted to central Europe: for Arthur, Lancelot, Guinevere and the Holy Grail read Siegfried, Golo, Genoveva and war against the Moors. </p> <p>With Ralph Koltai's perspex and chainmail set creating a series of timeless spaces, and Sue Willmington's costumes fixing the period somewhere in the middle ages, all these elements are very carefully integrated into Pountney's production, which gives each character a sharp definition, and never shrinks from the fact that a work that ends with a display of Christian charity is driven by the profoundly un-Christian motives of almost all concerned until that last quarter of an hour. </p> <p>When Siegfried's troops go off to war at the end of the first scene they do not wear crusaders' crosses on their breastplates but carry them like burdens on their backs, weighing them down; as Genoveva is driven into the wilderness for her execution she goes on all fours, using a pair of bibles as stepping stones. Even the unavoidable happy ending is mitigated somewhat by Siegfried's obvious self-reproach; all that religious certainty is made to seem little more than a veneer. </p> <p>But then everyone is made into a real person. Margaretha, compellingly acted by Sally Burgess, is less a fairytale witch than a slinky predator, whose power over Golo is generated by her sexual allure. Her third-act encounter with Siegfried, when she uses a magic mirror to show him the proof of Genoveva's adultery, is both the most original section of Schumann's score, with fluid, weightless string writing that looks forward to Wagner's Rheingold, and also the most visually arresting scene in the production, simply achieved. </p> <p> The hapless court steward Drago, who is framed as Genoveva's lover and summarily killed, is a timorous, bespectacled figure, another outstanding performance, vocally and dramatically, by Clive Bayley. Christopher Purves's Siegfried is the bluff, forthright figure that the role demands until his final moment of recrimination, and Paul Nilon's Golo is a tour de force - vocally commanding in what is some very high-lying tenor writing, and powerfully conveying the inner torments that fuel his actions. </p> <p>As Genoveva, Patricia Schuman certainly looks and acts the part convincingly, but her rather unvaried and sometimes out-of-tune singing did not quite conjure up the essential purity the role prescribes: it needs a great Lieder singer to do justice to that simplicity in her arias. In the pit, however, Sloane certainly does justice to the score - launching the opera with an account of the overture that steadily drew the threads of the drama together, and afterwards making every accompaniment spring into life. Even if the singing isn't always ideal, this is an immensely worthwhile and revelatory show. </p> <p>\u0095 At the Grand Theatre, Leeds, from tomorrow (0113- 222 6222), then touring in autumn.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Opera North may have had a bit of their thunder stolen by Garsington, which included Schumann's only opera in its country-house season in June, but their new production of Genoveva - conducted by Steven Sloane, directed by David Pountney, and almost certainly the first by a permanent British company since the 19th century - is still a major achievement of which everyone involved with this production, at the King's Theatre, Edinburgh, can be very proud. Those of us who have long thought the work unjustly neglected can feel vindicated, too, while those detractors - who have condemned as perversely anti-operatic Schumann's treatment of this story of love cruelly deceived but ultimately redeemed - now have the perfect opportunity to revise their opinion. That's not to claim Genoveva is a flawless masterpiece: it's neither flawless nor, quite, a masterpiece. But it's a totally absorbing and at times dramatically gripping work, with a score that contains a great deal of top-drawer music, even if some of the choral writing is weak and there are moments when Schumann's determination to be understated and not write a no-holds-barred Weber-style opera of the kind so fashionable in Germany in the 1840s causes the dramatic pacing to falter. The libretto is the composer's own, a sometimes rather uneasy marriage of two literary treatments, by Hebbel and Tieck, of the legend of Genevieve of Brabant. Genoveva's husband, Siegfried, goes off to fight a holy war against the Moors, entrusting his wife to the safe-keeping of his best friend, Golo. When Golo's own advances on Genoveva are rebuffed, he engineers accusations of adultery against her, and when Siegfried returns from routing the infidels, he furiously condemns her to death. But Genoveva's Christian faith protects her from execution until her husband discovers the truth, and the couple can live happily ever after in religious and marital bliss. Psychologically, Golo is the lynch-pin of the opera, a tragic angst-ridden figure torn between his lust for Genoveva and his loyalty to Siegfried, while the snow-white heroine herself is almost a cipher, a blank sheet - save for her religious faith - on to which the men around her can project their fantasies. Her dark opposite is Margaretha, the witch who manipulates Golo and plots the downfall of Siegfried and his kingdom, in just the way that Morgan Le Fay pulls the strings in the court of King Arthur; Schumann intended to write an Arthurian opera and only abandoned the idea when he heard of Wagner's plans for Lohengrin. But in a curious way Genoveva is precisely that work transplanted to central Europe: for Arthur, Lancelot, Guinevere and the Holy Grail read Siegfried, Golo, Genoveva and war against the Moors. With Ralph Koltai's perspex and chainmail set creating a series of timeless spaces, and Sue Willmington's costumes fixing the period somewhere in the middle ages, all these elements are very carefully integrated into Pountney's production, which gives each character a sharp definition, and never shrinks from the fact that a work that ends with a display of Christian charity is driven by the profoundly un-Christian motives of almost all concerned until that last quarter of an hour. When Siegfried's troops go off to war at the end of the first scene they do not wear crusaders' crosses on their breastplates but carry them like burdens on their backs, weighing them down; as Genoveva is driven into the wilderness for her execution she goes on all fours, using a pair of bibles as stepping stones. Even the unavoidable happy ending is mitigated somewhat by Siegfried's obvious self-reproach; all that religious certainty is made to seem little more than a veneer. But then everyone is made into a real person. Margaretha, compellingly acted by Sally Burgess, is less a fairytale witch than a slinky predator, whose power over Golo is generated by her sexual allure. Her third-act encounter with Siegfried, when she uses a magic mirror to show him the proof of Genoveva's adultery, is both the most original section of Schumann's score, with fluid, weightless string writing that looks forward to Wagner's Rheingold, and also the most visually arresting scene in the production, simply achieved. The hapless court steward Drago, who is framed as Genoveva's lover and summarily killed, is a timorous, bespectacled figure, another outstanding performance, vocally and dramatically, by Clive Bayley. Christopher Purves's Siegfried is the bluff, forthright figure that the role demands until his final moment of recrimination, and Paul Nilon's Golo is a tour de force - vocally commanding in what is some very high-lying tenor writing, and powerfully conveying the inner torments that fuel his actions. As Genoveva, Patricia Schuman certainly looks and acts the part convincingly, but her rather unvaried and sometimes out-of-tune singing did not quite conjure up the essential purity the role prescribes: it needs a great Lieder singer to do justice to that simplicity in her arias. In the pit, however, Sloane certainly does justice to the score - launching the opera with an account of the overture that steadily drew the threads of the drama together, and afterwards making every accompaniment spring into life. Even if the singing isn't always ideal, this is an immensely worthwhile and revelatory show. \u0095 At the Grand Theatre, Leeds, from tomorrow (0113- 222 6222), then touring in autumn.",

      "bodyText": "The war of attrition between the hunts and the saboteurs escalated over the weekend when around 50 protesters wearing balaclavas attacked fox hound kennels in Surrey. With the hunting season barely a week old, Friday saw a hunt saboteur airlifted to hospital after being hit by a Land Rover in what protesters claimed was a premeditated attack. And on Saturday police were called to the Old Surrey and Burstow Fox Hound Kennels at Felbridge, Surrey, shortly after 7.30pm, following reports of trespassers damaging the property. The manager of the kennels, Mark Bycroft, 29, whose pregnant wife and 15-month-old daughter were in one of three houses attacked, called the protesters \"anarchists\" who had no respect for \"women, children, property or animals\". \"Three vans and a Land Rover drove down the road towards the premises. They were all dressed in black and wearing balaclavas and masks. They overpowered the two police officers, who had been warned the group were on the way, shouted vile abuse and began hurling rocks and bricks.\" Mr Bycroft said 17 windows were smashed and a number of rocks were thrown into the kennels, leaving glass scattered on the ground. \"We have an 18-year-old kennel hand living here who was absolutely petrified by this baying gang. She was forced to hide at the back of the kennels,\" Mr Bycroft added. \"These people have no respect for anything. They are not just anti-hunting, they are anti-everything and have an absolute disregard for the law. They are quite happy to terrify women and children in their own homes at night.\" Surrey police, who had been called to the premises when the group began to meet at East Grinstead railway station, did not make any arrests but have begun a full investigation into the incident, during which officers used CS gas to disperse the group. A spokesman from the Hunt Saboteurs Association claimed the group had gone to the compound for a peaceful demonstration but had been attacked with pick-axe handles. The saboteurs claimed the demonstration had been sparked by a violent incident on Friday morning when a protester had been \"deliberately run-over\" by a hunt member as they met in Horsted Keynes, near Crawley, West Sussex. Steve Christmas, in his 30s and from the Haywards Heath area, was airlifted to hospital with a broken pelvis and ribs, and remains in intensive care. Dawn Preston, spokeswoman for the Hunt Saboteurs, claimed Mr Christmas was deliberately run down by an off-road vehicle as he protested against the hunt's meeting at Warren Farm, near Crawley. \"I believe [Saturday night's] action at the home of the hunt followed the deliberate attempt to seriously injure an animal rights activist,\" Ms Preston said. \"I am unaware of the full circumstances of the peaceful action, but I know there were no arrests.\" Last night Sussex police said a man had been arrested, interviewed and released on bail following the incident. A spokesman said the driver was not in any way connected with the hunt.",

      "bodyText": "The UN's attempts to prosecute war criminals in Kosovo yesterday suffered a major setback following the escape of 15 Serb prisoners from a UN-run detention centre in the north of the province. The fugitives, two of whom have been recaptured, are accused of crimes including genocide and mass murder. Nato-led peacekeeping troops set up road blocks and conducted house-to-house searches near the jail in the town of Mitrovice throughout Saturday night and Sunday. Sniffer dogs were used to check nearby woods. UN officials say the prisoners managed to escape after a gun was smuggled into the prison. The breakout was initiated late on Saturday night when a prisoner was allowed out of his cell to make a phone call. As a guard, a Nepalese policeman serving with the UN police force in Kosovo, returned him to the cell, other inmates brandishing a pistol hit him over the head. His keys were taken and the group released others from their cells. Three more guards, two Nepalese and one Indian, were overpowered and tied up. It took half an hour before the alarm was raised with K-For peacekeeping troops during which time 13 prisoners had scaled a fence and fled the detention centre unnoticed. The two recaptured inmates were arrested after they had returned to one of the cells to collect their belongings. The escape is the second involving Serbs accused of war crimes in less than two months and is a major embarrassment to the UN. The prosecution of war crimes is seen by Kosovo's majority Albanian population as highly important. The UN is setting a up a war and ethnic crimes court to deal with the issue. The remains of over 2,800 bodies have been recovered so far from mass graves in Kosovo, but not one war crimes trial has yet been completed. As the UN announced an internal investigation, it emerged that police had failed to increase security at the detention centre following the escape of three Serbs in July. The men, who were wanted for genocide and murder, escaped when they were being treated in a local Serb-run hospital. UN officials had suggested a special police unit would be deployed to bolster the number of guards in the prison, a measure that was not put into effect. William Nash, the United Nations administrator in Mitrovice, voiced his disbelief at the escape. \"It is hard to express the deep concern I have over this latest incident.\" He also implied that responsibility for the breakout lay with police in the province and denied the local UN administration was to blame. \"For our part we continue to focus on our duties and responsibilities,\" he said. The escape means that only 15 of the 26 people who had been charged with war crimes or genocide in Kosovo now remain in custody. The head of the UN mission in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, met the head of the peacekeeping troops in the province, General Juan Ortuno, last night to review security measures. UN officials suggested that detainees may be transferred to another prison in Kosovo.",

      "bodyText": "In an act of rebellion against the linguistic invasion that has overrun Poland since the fall of communism in 1989, a new law has been introduced to protect the Polish language. The use of words such as \"sex shop\", \"supermarket\", \"music club\" and \"plaza\" have been effectively outlawed after the Polish language purity law came into force last month. Foreign languages are now banned from many aspects of day-to-day life in Poland unless translations are given alongside. A \"language police\" from the newly formed Polish language council will monitor progress. Those found to be violating the law could face heavy fines. During the draft stages of the bill, the extreme positions of many of those supporting it, particularly the right of centre populist Peasant's party, were clearly evident. \"They initially wanted to punish people for not conversing in Polish during private conversation,\" said Iwona Sledzinska-Katarasinska of the centrist Freedom Union, a philologist from the city of Lodz who introduced the bill. \"The law as it stands is much less radical than its founders wanted.\" Among issues initially debated were whether to allow proper nouns. \"Some seriously suggested that Johnnie Walker whisky should be renamed for the Polish market 'Jasio Wedrowniczek' (or Wandering Johnnie), and Tommy Hilfiger became 'Tomek Hilfiger',\" said Ms Sledzinska-Katarasinska. Although the new law has received widespread support in Poland - opinion polls suggested that 83% of the country's 40m inhabitants were in favour of such legislation - it has worried some business people. \"When capitalists marched in here 10 years ago they brought with them an army of words which filtered into the Polish language,\" said Lech, a 34-year-old accountant who works for an American company. \"Many of these cannot be translated into Polish because it's a very descriptive language and we would just get bogged down,\" he added, giving as examples \"due diligence\", \"venture capital\", \"private equity\", \"marketing\", \"computer\" and \"internet\". Lech and others, particularly those in marketing who will be hardest hit, complain that having to translate all documents into Polish will waste valuable time. \"It's natural for young Poles to use English words, particularly when they're more effective than the Polish equivalent,\" said Magda Nowak, a 27-year-old business development coordinator at a Warsaw-based venture capital company, citing \"email\" as a superior substitute for \"list elektronczny\" or \"electronic letter\". But supporters of the law say it is necessary to empower the consumer. \"Over the last 10 years, with foreign imports flooding in, a large proportion of the non-English speaking public have been excluded from knowing what was really on offer, and now they will be able to know in their language what is happening in their own country,\" says Wanda Samborska, spokeswoman for the Peasant's party. Passed at the same time as a broadcasting law that states that one-third of music played on radio stations must be Polish, the anti-\"Polglish\" law has led to comparisons with infamous French efforts to quash \"franglais\". According to the Polish daily Rzeczpospolita, diplomatic sources in Brussels have warned of stiff reprisals if Warsaw does not modify the new law, which it sees as a barrier to foreign companies wishing to set up in Poland. But, after two world wars and the dominance of German, followed by the repression wrought by decades of communism during which time people were forced to learn Russian, many Poles are happy that their language finally has a chance to thrive. \"We simply want to keep the language free from pollution and to send out a signal to people that their culture is being protected despite the increasing influences from outside,\" says Ms Sledzinska-Katarasinska.",

Foreign diplomats were unable to contact Ms Suu Kyi in her home, which was surrounded by troops and police who were said to have padlocked the gate. The US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, joined EU leaders over the weekend in condemning the action by the Burmese military junta. She said the US was outraged and strongly condemned the violation of the human rights of Ms Suu Kyi and members of her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD). The junta's official propaganda put out a mocking statement claiming that Ms Suu Kyi had \"arrived home safe and sound\".

She and her travel companions had been \"escorted\" home on Saturday \"in a motorcade facilitated by the government for their safe and convenient return\". Burmese security officials raided the NLD headquarters after Ms Suu Kyi was forced home. Members of the party going to the building to seek information were denied entry. Foreign diplomats were also turned away by military intelligence officials. One security official claimed that \"incriminatory material and documents\" had been seized. Diplomats said that at least three senior members of the NLD had also been detained and had their telephone lines cut. The regime said that no NLD executive committee members were under arrest, but said their movement was being \"restricted\". NLD members were apprehensive last night that the junta was preparing to suppress the party which had survived in spite of years of harassment. Ms Suu Kyi was stopped on the road when she tested the regime's restrictions on August 24 by leaving the capital in an attempt to visit the NLD's youth wing in the countryside.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>BODY BEAUTIFUL</p> <p>Imagine, Arsenal fans, that you were Dr Frankenstein. Imagine you had enough demonic power - and, of course, electricity - to create your perfect central defender. Obviously he would be big, strong and able to shoot his hand up for offside even in his sleep. That much goes without saying. And a penchant for near-post flick-ons and the West End play 'Art' would be nice too. Hang on a minute though, that's a perfect synthesis of Tony Adams and Steve Bould - and surely that's impossible! </p> <p>Well think again, because that defender already exists. His name is Igors Stepanovs, he's a Latvian international and - control yourself you Gooners - he's signed for Arsenal. \"Igors can definitely do a job in the Premiership. He is in the same mould as Tony Adams, which is why he will fit in so well at the Arsenal,\" said Graham Johnson, Latvia's English coach (who, in case you're wondering, used to manage Cambridge). \"The lad was magnificent against Scotland [at the weekend],\" Johnson went on. \"Steve Rowley [the Arsenal scout] was full of praise for the lad and thought there was a bit of Steve Bould in his game as well.\"</p> <p>That's some billing, and the 6ft 3ins centre-back could prove his worth as soon as this Wednesday. Because with Tony Adams out - reportedly for a month - and with a fresh-smelling work permit arriving at Highbury this very morning, Stepanovs looks likely to be hurled into the lions' den (well, Stamford Bridge). Not that Johnson, Stepanov's one-man fan club, is worried. \"I have told him if he plays like he did against Scotland in the Premiership he will soon be a millionaire in England,\" he twittered. But what will Stepanovs do with the money? Buy Lee Dixon's thigh muscles, we would wager.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p>NOT-SO CLEVER TREVOR</p> <p>The Fiver loves the Sunday papers. They're as important a part of the weekend as the Saturday fry-up and the Friday night vomit. The Sunday papers are what make this country great. After all, where else could you read about the latest in light fittings, catch up with the movements of your local paedophile, get the recipe for a meal comprised entirely of artichokes, or read Birmingham City chairman David Sullivan having a pop at his manager, Trevor Francis, over two pages?</p> <p>Sky pundit Francis declared over the weekend that there is a conspiracy aimed at forcing him out of St Andrews. Sullivan told the Birmingham Sunday Mercury that Francis should stop talking like that, if he doesn't want to be forced out of the club. \"I would describe Trevor's reaction as paranoia,\" Sullivan said. \"His nature is one of pessimism. He paints a gloomy picture and has a policy of talking the team down. That way if we do badly he can say 'I told you so'. But if we do well he can tell us all what a wonderful manager he is.\"</p> <p>Francis, when not making Richard Keys look like an erudite afficionado of the game, has over the course of the past four seasons used porn magnate Sullivan's millions to steer the Blues away from promotion and acquire a complete collection of Mediocre Players \u0099. Not that Sullivan believes Francis would cut it even if he did make it to the Premiership. \"The task of staying there would be phenomenal and he might say 'I don't need this in my life',\" Sullivan said. So, all in all, a ringing endorsement. That Trev should just chill out - he'll do himself a misfortune.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p>QUOTE OF THE DAY</p> <p>\"It's a lie.

      "bodyText": "BODY BEAUTIFUL Imagine, Arsenal fans, that you were Dr Frankenstein. Imagine you had enough demonic power - and, of course, electricity - to create your perfect central defender. Obviously he would be big, strong and able to shoot his hand up for offside even in his sleep. That much goes without saying. And a penchant for near-post flick-ons and the West End play 'Art' would be nice too. Hang on a minute though, that's a perfect synthesis of Tony Adams and Steve Bould - and surely that's impossible! Well think again, because that defender already exists. His name is Igors Stepanovs, he's a Latvian international and - control yourself you Gooners - he's signed for Arsenal. \"Igors can definitely do a job in the Premiership. He is in the same mould as Tony Adams, which is why he will fit in so well at the Arsenal,\" said Graham Johnson, Latvia's English coach (who, in case you're wondering, used to manage Cambridge). \"The lad was magnificent against Scotland [at the weekend],\" Johnson went on. \"Steve Rowley [the Arsenal scout] was full of praise for the lad and thought there was a bit of Steve Bould in his game as well.\" That's some billing, and the 6ft 3ins centre-back could prove his worth as soon as this Wednesday. Because with Tony Adams out - reportedly for a month - and with a fresh-smelling work permit arriving at Highbury this very morning, Stepanovs looks likely to be hurled into the lions' den (well, Stamford Bridge). Not that Johnson, Stepanov's one-man fan club, is worried. \"I have told him if he plays like he did against Scotland in the Premiership he will soon be a millionaire in England,\" he twittered. But what will Stepanovs do with the money? Buy Lee Dixon's thigh muscles, we would wager. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NOT-SO CLEVER TREVOR The Fiver loves the Sunday papers. They're as important a part of the weekend as the Saturday fry-up and the Friday night vomit. The Sunday papers are what make this country great. After all, where else could you read about the latest in light fittings, catch up with the movements of your local paedophile, get the recipe for a meal comprised entirely of artichokes, or read Birmingham City chairman David Sullivan having a pop at his manager, Trevor Francis, over two pages? Sky pundit Francis declared over the weekend that there is a conspiracy aimed at forcing him out of St Andrews. Sullivan told the Birmingham Sunday Mercury that Francis should stop talking like that, if he doesn't want to be forced out of the club. \"I would describe Trevor's reaction as paranoia,\" Sullivan said. \"His nature is one of pessimism. He paints a gloomy picture and has a policy of talking the team down. That way if we do badly he can say 'I told you so'. But if we do well he can tell us all what a wonderful manager he is.\" Francis, when not making Richard Keys look like an erudite afficionado of the game, has over the course of the past four seasons used porn magnate Sullivan's millions to steer the Blues away from promotion and acquire a complete collection of Mediocre Players \u0099. Not that Sullivan believes Francis would cut it even if he did make it to the Premiership. \"The task of staying there would be phenomenal and he might say 'I don't need this in my life',\" Sullivan said. So, all in all, a ringing endorsement. That Trev should just chill out - he'll do himself a misfortune. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"It's a lie. I am not a crook, I do not have to hide in my house. These accusations make me upset and I cannot allow them.\" Brazil manager Wanderley Luxemburgo responds to allegations that he accepted bribes and forged documents about his age.
