      "body": "<p>Michael Bright, founder of former stock market darling Independent Insurance, yesterday shouldered the responsibility for the collapse in the insurers' share price by resigning as chief executive. </p> <p>Mr Bright's move to relinquish day-to-day control prompted speculation that the 14-year-old company might attract a takeover bid.</p> <p>The surprise announcement came at yesterday's annual shareholder meeting, immediately after the board had discussed the shares' drop in just two months from above \u00a33.50 to yesterday's \u00a31.33.</p> <p>Chairman Garth Ramsay, who is to take a temporary executive role while a new chief executive is sought, said: \"The share price has performed very poorly since the results in early March. It reflects a loss of confidence in the company in terms of the stock market\".</p> <p>He insisted that Mr Bright - whose personal wealth is tied up in the company - had not been pushed and that the decision was \"mutual\". Mr Bright, who built the company up from scratch, owns some 14m shares and did not take last year's bonus. He took home \u00a3650,000 against \u00a31m the year before.</p> <p>Until February, Independent Insurance was one of the stock market's favourites. It suffered a sharp reversal in its fortunes after a profits warning in February and the announcement in March of a 42% fall in its profits to \u00a340m. The company has suffered from underwriting losses in France and \"no fee, no win\" insurance claims. It also has a complicated reinsurance arrangement in place which, it said, would cost \u00a339m in cash.</p> <p>While the step-down by Mr Bright caused concern because of his close association with the company, Barrie Cornes, analyst at ING Barings, said: \"Michael Bright is very well known. He is surrounded by strong people.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Michael Bright, founder of former stock market darling Independent Insurance, yesterday shouldered the responsibility for the collapse in the insurers' share price by resigning as chief executive. Mr Bright's move to relinquish day-to-day control prompted speculation that the 14-year-old company might attract a takeover bid. The surprise announcement came at yesterday's annual shareholder meeting, immediately after the board had discussed the shares' drop in just two months from above \u00a33.50 to yesterday's \u00a31.33. Chairman Garth Ramsay, who is to take a temporary executive role while a new chief executive is sought, said: \"The share price has performed very poorly since the results in early March. It reflects a loss of confidence in the company in terms of the stock market\". He insisted that Mr Bright - whose personal wealth is tied up in the company - had not been pushed and that the decision was \"mutual\". Mr Bright, who built the company up from scratch, owns some 14m shares and did not take last year's bonus. He took home \u00a3650,000 against \u00a31m the year before. Until February, Independent Insurance was one of the stock market's favourites. It suffered a sharp reversal in its fortunes after a profits warning in February and the announcement in March of a 42% fall in its profits to \u00a340m. The company has suffered from underwriting losses in France and \"no fee, no win\" insurance claims. It also has a complicated reinsurance arrangement in place which, it said, would cost \u00a339m in cash. While the step-down by Mr Bright caused concern because of his close association with the company, Barrie Cornes, analyst at ING Barings, said: \"Michael Bright is very well known. He is surrounded by strong people.\"",

      "bodyText": "Leading North American hi-tech groups last night underlined the dilemmas confronting the US Federal Reserve in giving a clear sense of direction to the world's biggest economy by announcing a mixed set of results. Both Microsoft and Sun Microsystems announced quarterly profits that surpassed - if only just - Wall Street expectations, while Canada's Nortel reported a hefty loss. The figures, coming just a day after the Fed stunned markets with a half-point cut in borrowing rates, added to the confusing picture of US corporate health confronting policy-makers, with some of the bigger corporations performing well and others showing evidence of sagging profits and sales. Microsoft said earnings had been boosted by stronger sales of its Windows 2000 software. It said that for its third fiscal quarter, ended March 31, it made net profits of $2.45bn (\u00a31.7bn), or 44 cents a share, compared with $2.39bn, 43 cents a share, a year earlier. It posted revenues of $6.46bn, against $5.66bn a year earlier. Sun Microsystems, the network computer maker, beat lowered profit targets in its third quarter but sales missed analysts' target. Sales at the firm, which scaled back its targets in February, rose 2% to $4.1bn from $4bn last year, while operating earnings were $263m, or eight cents per share, against $464m, or 14 cents, a year ago. Nortel Networks, the world's biggest telecoms equipment supplier, reported a first-quarter loss in line with expectations. It said it lost $385m, or 12 cents per share excluding one-time costs, compared with year-earlier net earnings of $347m, or 12 cents per share.

And if mortgage rates are excluded from the calculations - the index preferred by the government - then the figure comes down even lower, to just 1.9%. </p> <p>But with polling day delayed for a month there was no set-piece press conference attended by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, no tour of the TV and radio studios, no attacks on Tory \"boom and bust\". </p> <p>On May 15 - the date when the data for prices in April is released - it be a different story. Cheaper mortgages and the chancellor's tax changes in the Budget will mean the inflation rate comes down a lot further, and with June 7 then only three weeks away there will be no holding back. The message will be that Labour, for so long haunted by the curse of high inflation, has taken the tough decisions needed to keep price rises low. </p> <p>The figures released yesterday by the office for national statistics support the case that something fundamental has changed, despite the fluctuations caused by one-off events such as the foot and mouth epidemic and bad weather. The slaughter of livestock pushed up pork prices by 10%, bacon by 9.6% and imported lamb by 4.9%. Prices of cauliflowers, cucumbers, lettuces, tomatoes and cabbages have all been affected by the unusually wet weather this winter. </p> <p>But over the longer term all the government's many different measures of inflation point to the same conclusion: that Britain is now a low inflation country. Measured by the all-items retail prices index - a basket of 650 goods covering 147 areas across the UK - inflation is 2.3%, compared with 27% at its post-war peak in 1975. </p> <p>On an international basis, the picture is even better. The EU uses a different method to calculate prices across Europe, and on this basis Britain's inflation rate is 0.8%, the lowest in the union. </p> <p>Falling inflation has been accompanied by much lower interest rates, something else for the government to revel in during the election campaign. A return to the inflation levels last seen in the 1950s and early 1960s has meant a return to the borrowing costs of 30 or 40 years ago. Interest rates, raised to 15% when inflation was nudging 11% in 1990, are down to 5.5%. Some City analysts believe they could be cut to 4.5% over the coming months. </p> <p>Government figures show that this fall in inflation is not a flash in the pan. Inflation averaged 2.6% a year between 1993 and 2000, with no evidence that a prolonged period of economic growth, accompanied by a fall in unemployment from almost 3m to just under 1m, is leading to increased price pressure. </p> <p>Overall, prices have risen by 72.2% since the retail prices index was last re-based at 100 in January 1987. But that increase disguises large disparities between different categories of spending. The prices of goods, where international competition has been ferocious, have risen much more slowly than inflation as a whole, but in large chunks of the service sector consumers are still getting a raw deal. The most spectacular example of falling prices is in audio-visual equipment, which now costs less than 40% of its price in 1987, largely as a result of the impact of cheaper and more powerful computer equipment. </p> <p>Household electrical appliances such as washing machines are almost 10% cheaper than at the end of the 1980s, while women's clothing costs 88% of prices 14 years ago. Even those goods which have increased in price - such as toys, CDs and tapes, furniture, shoes and men's clothing - have tended to rise more slowly than inflation as a whole. Food is up by 46.7% since 1987. </p> <p>So where is the inflation coming from? The answer is that prices in those parts of the economy sheltered from international competition or where the government has added to costs through taxation have risen sharply. Above-inflation increases in tobacco duties have meant that cigarettes have risen by more than any other item in the RPI basket, by 190% since 1987. Personal services such as dental examinations, eye tests and hairdressing follow a close second with a 177% rise, while the cost of entertainment is up by 167.6% and the cost of alcoholic drinks up 89.8%. The cost of taxing and insuring a car is up 164.8%, while rail fares are up 112%. </p> <p>In some areas of the service sector, government involvement has been good. Strengthened regulatory control over the privatised utilities has led to a sharp reduction in prices. Gas is up by less than 15% since 1987, electricity by 27.7%, and telephone charges have fallen by more than 10%. Only water - up by more than 150% - has bucked the trend. </p> <p>Given that rising prices helped to remove Labour from power in the elections of 1970 and 1979, it is hardly surprising that the party will seek to reap the political benefit of low inflation. But Roger Bootle, the economist who wrote the book The Death of Inflation in the mid-1990s, believes that longer term factors have been at work and that governments everywhere could soon have to grapple with the Japanese problem - falling prices. </p> <p>Globalisation, technological advance, competition and a tougher approach to inflation have all contributed to a change in the inflationary climate, which has been under way for 20 years. \"If this is what happens after 10 years of economic growth, it makes you wonder what would happen in a downturn,\" Mr Bootle said. </p> <p>The spectre of deflation, when a whole economy suffers the equivalent of negative equity, is one thing that would certainly not be welcome to the government. </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/cpi0401.pdf\">www.statistics.gov.uk</a><br> Consumer price indices for March</p>",

But each installation confounds this interpretation and insists on Wearing's universality. For me, the best work is the trilogy made during her two- year collaboration with a community of south London alcoholics. In the first, a woman recounts the death of her alcoholic twin sister. It's sometimes tender, the disjunction between this woman's speech and her image a poignant way of underlining her own alcoholism without judgment. (She has since died of cirrhosis.)

In the last, one of the men lies dead drunk. </p> <p>The show is juxtaposed with the cunning video art of Swede Ann-Sofi Siden. In Britain, her interviews with prostitutes would make just another docusoap. Here, you sit in one of a line of booths listening on headphones to a prostitute's life story. You feel intimate with the subject and yet, at the same time, like a voyeur - not least because when you look down the line of booths where art lovers sit complicit, you realise the gallery has been transformed into a cultural peep show. Why do we come to galleries to feed on others' strife and give nothing back? Like Wearing, Siden makes going to see art a problematic, painful experience. </p> <p>\u0095 Until May 6.

      "byline": "Mark Milner",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Imagine applying for a car loan and being asked not only which way you vote but whether or not you approve of elections. Or maybe how you feel about the rights of minority shareholders. Hardly standard questions on the average bank loan form. </p> <p>Trot along to Jean Lemierre's bank, however, and expect a grilling on more than just your finances. But then Mr Lemierre is no ordinary banker - his priorities are profits, poverty and politics. His employer, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is an international financial institution yet its role is of first mover, not lender of last resort. It is publicly funded but focuses on the private sector. Its mandate is to support the economies in central and eastern Europe (and beyond) as they change from central planning to a market orientation. And it has to do so while encouraging the development of democratic institutions. </p> <p>Oh yes, and customers can range from industrial Russian behemoths seeking hundreds of millions of dollars, to wannabe entrepreneurs in Bosnia looking for a few bucks to rebuild the local cafe. </p> <p>Sounds contradictory? Not to Mr Lemierre, an affable and relaxed former French civil servant. \"The logic of the bank is very clear, very simple. This institution fits very well with a world where economic progress, investment are financed by private capital flows. What this bank is here to do is to reduce the risk to private investors, to help them invest where they believe to do so is still too risky. This is a very modern way, a very clever way. </p> <p>\"We don't compete with the private sector, we are an addition to the private sector. There are no contradictions.\" </p> <p>To Anglo-Saxons that might sound a little French. No surprise there. Mr Lemierre is the third Frenchman to head the bank in the 10 years since it was set up in the aftermath of the collapse of the old Soviet bloc. French leadership has been interrupted only by Germany's Horst K\u00f6hler and a couple of brief interludes when presidential departures meant spells of vice-presidential sway. </p> <p>This weekend the bank is holding its annual meeting in London - a gathering which marks the EBRD's 10th anniversary. The years have not been without problems. The first president, Jacques Attali, was big on vision but under his leadership the EBRD earned a reputation as a bank that liked to say \"yes\" - to itself. Unsurprisingly, he departed early, trailing accusations of extravagance - not least over an estimated \u00a3750,000 bill for remarbling the halls of the bank's London headquarters. </p> <p>Enter Jacques de Larosi\u00e8re, a veteran of the Banque de France and the International Monetary Fund under whose leadership, as a Financial Times editorial noted, the bank grew \"into its role as a facilitator of vital investments in the former Soviet empire.\" </p> <p>But after all the publicity of the Attali era, Mr de Larosi\u00e8re appeared determined to keep the bank out of the spotlight, which may have made sense for much of the time but did, on occasion, create problems of presentation. </p> <p>The bank's role is simply incompatible with a low profile. Its involvement in a controversial project to finance the completion of nuclear facilities in the Ukraine - as a quid pro quo for the closure of Chernobyl - has attracted considerable criticism from environmental campaigners. Inevitably, the bank's loan portfolio suffered considerably from the fallout from Russia's partial debt default in 1998. </p> <p>Even as delegates fly in to London, CEE Bankwatch, a non-governmental organisation with members drawn from countries in central and eastern Europe, is holding a press conference under the heading \"EBRD; a decade of misinformation and secrecy\". </p> <p>CEE Bankwatch is expected to criticise the bank either for not giving sufficient information or not insisting its clients give sufficient information about projects to allow effective public consultation. </p> <p>Still the bank can put a positive enough gloss on its activities. Over the past decade it has invested or lent some 17.5bn euros (\u00a311bn) of its own money, which it reckons brought a further 44.5bn euros from co-investors. </p> <p>In recent years the EBRD has focused more on providing investment to small and medium sized enterprises - either directly or through specialist banks. Mr Lemierre is anxious to help the build-up of a base of new entrepreneurs who will help drive future economic prosperity. </p> <p>It has been profitable for seven of its 10 years - it made losses in the first two and then again in 1998 when it was hit by the fallout from the Russian debt crisis. </p> <p>As the politicians, bankers and entrepreneurs from east and west gather in London over the next three days, Mr Lemierre will be keen to deliver a forward looking message. </p> <p>Inevitably, speeches from the finance ministers who represent the bank's sovereign shareholders will be peppered with strictures for the bank to operate on \"sound banking principles\". Mr Lemierre has no problem with that. \"It is very good for the bank to respect sound banking principles. You can't built economies by making losses. </p> <p>\"We are using taxpayers money and, to talk like a technocrat, the allocation of capital must be done on a sound basis. </p> <p>\"If you have a project where you don't understand the financial and economic sustainability, there is a problem. There is something wrong. It would be a big mistake if the bank financed projects that were not sensible. That would send the wrong message.\" </p> <p><strong> Ensuring the future</strong><br> </p> <p> There is, however, a \"but\" - and it is a significant one. For Mr Lemierre, making a profit is important in that it underpins the bank's long-term future - ensuring that it continues in operation, helping the transition process in central and eastern Europe. </p> <p>But the bank is not in the business, he says, of profits maximisation. That, he believes, would affect its ability to take risks and so to act effectively. For Mr Lemierre the yardstick is the impact the bank's investments and loans - and the money of private-sector banks and investors it brings on board - has on the economies in which it operates. </p> <p>\"What is very interesting about this job is the people. You work with people and for people. You don't work for the balance sheet.\" </p> <p>Not that the bank sees itself as a soft touch. While it may not look for a bench mark return on its investment, it is very keen on what Mr Lemierre calls conditionality. This is a tricky area and varies from country to country and project to project. \"We don't have a tool box with already prepared conditions of choice. We have to look at what will have the best impact, what is credible.\" </p> <p>Inevitably this is where the politics comes in. For the EBRD is not just about setting repayment conditions. If it is being asked to fund, say, an energy utility or transport system it will want to ensure that the tariff policy is sufficient to sustain the financial commitment. In other words, prices - traditionally set well below market rates under central planning - have to rise. For politicians that is never good news. </p> <p>In broader terms, the bank also has to make an assessment of the progress individual countries are making towards democracy. As Mr Lemierre notes, the EBRD \"is the only international financial institution to have to make this assessment\". It is also a recipe for the bank to be caught in the crossfire between those who think its democratic mandate is a licence to interfere and those who think it does not interfere enough. </p> <p>The EBRD has ruffled a few feathers in the corporate sector, too. It has had its clashes over areas such as corporate governance and transparency. Again Mr Lemierre sees it as a balance between standards that the EBRD believes are essential if progress is to be made but which must be understood and accepted by those seeking loans or investment. </p> <p> \"We must explain, we must have a real policy dialogue with the companies and countries. The conditions must be relevant and adapted to the project involved. If they are not understood they will not be expected. </p> <p>\"What we have to say is that we are ready to work with you - but there is no free lunch.\" Gazprom is a case in point. It would like some $250m (\u00a3180m) of the EBRD's money. The bank wants some questions answered first. So far, no answers, so no money, either. </p> <p>Mr Lemierre is committed to the market economy model, not, he says, on ideological grounds but because it is the best way of creating wealth. But he acknowledges that the process of change has brought problems. </p> <p>In the old days of central planning there was a popular joke among workers that \"we pretend to work and they pretend to pay us\". These days it is no joke, as enterprises close leaving workers and pensioners dependent on safety nets that, at best, are inadequate and at worst nonexistent. </p> <p>Mr Lemierre acknowledges the problem and says it will be one of the messages he will deliver to the AGM. </p> <p>\"In the first stage [of transition], which can be long, sometimes you are creating jobs, creating new activities but at other times you are destroying the welfare system. </p> <p>\"When you restructure old systems you create poverty, despair and I think in our countries of operation there is a real need to work to address more the questions of poverty, health and education. </p> <p>\"We need to make a bridge between the old and new systems. </p> <p>\"People must know that when they have huge difficulties, there is some hope. At the end of the day people must know there is a small bank somewhere in London where people are trying to help.\" </p> <p><strong>Decade of highs and lows</strong><br></p> <p><strong> May 1990: </strong> agreement to establish bank signed </p> <p><strong> April 1991:</strong> inauguration of EBRD headquarters, election of Jacques Attali as president </p> <p><strong> June 1991:</strong> first loan approved </p> <p><strong> November 1991:</strong> first regional office, in Warsaw </p> <p><strong> April 1992:</strong> first annual meeting - in Budapest </p> <p><strong> April 1993: </strong> scandal over 'extravagance' breaks </p> <p><strong> July 1993:</strong> Attali resigns </p> <p><strong> July 1993:</strong> Russia small business fund set up </p> <p><strong> Sept 1993:</strong> Jacques de Larosi\u00e8re elected president </p> <p><strong> April 1996: </strong> shareholders agree to double bank's capital to 20bn euros </p> <p><strong> June 1996:</strong> Bosnia Herzegovina becomes EBRD member </p> <p><strong> Dec 1996:</strong> bank now has loans in all 26 countries of operation </p> <p><strong> June 1998:</strong> Jacques Attali retires </p> <p><strong> September 1998: </strong> Horst K\u00f6hler becomes president </p> <p><strong> April 2000:</strong> K\u00f6hler steps down to become head of the IMF </p> <p><strong> July 2000:</strong> Jean Lemierre becomes EBRD president</p>",

      "bodyText": "Imagine applying for a car loan and being asked not only which way you vote but whether or not you approve of elections. Or maybe how you feel about the rights of minority shareholders. Hardly standard questions on the average bank loan form. Trot along to Jean Lemierre's bank, however, and expect a grilling on more than just your finances. But then Mr Lemierre is no ordinary banker - his priorities are profits, poverty and politics. His employer, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is an international financial institution yet its role is of first mover, not lender of last resort. It is publicly funded but focuses on the private sector. Its mandate is to support the economies in central and eastern Europe (and beyond) as they change from central planning to a market orientation. And it has to do so while encouraging the development of democratic institutions. Oh yes, and customers can range from industrial Russian behemoths seeking hundreds of millions of dollars, to wannabe entrepreneurs in Bosnia looking for a few bucks to rebuild the local cafe. Sounds contradictory? Not to Mr Lemierre, an affable and relaxed former French civil servant. \"The logic of the bank is very clear, very simple. This institution fits very well with a world where economic progress, investment are financed by private capital flows. What this bank is here to do is to reduce the risk to private investors, to help them invest where they believe to do so is still too risky. This is a very modern way, a very clever way. \"We don't compete with the private sector, we are an addition to the private sector. There are no contradictions.\" To Anglo-Saxons that might sound a little French. No surprise there. Mr Lemierre is the third Frenchman to head the bank in the 10 years since it was set up in the aftermath of the collapse of the old Soviet bloc. French leadership has been interrupted only by Germany's Horst K\u00f6hler and a couple of brief interludes when presidential departures meant spells of vice-presidential sway. This weekend the bank is holding its annual meeting in London - a gathering which marks the EBRD's 10th anniversary. The years have not been without problems. The first president, Jacques Attali, was big on vision but under his leadership the EBRD earned a reputation as a bank that liked to say \"yes\" - to itself. Unsurprisingly, he departed early, trailing accusations of extravagance - not least over an estimated \u00a3750,000 bill for remarbling the halls of the bank's London headquarters. Enter Jacques de Larosi\u00e8re, a veteran of the Banque de France and the International Monetary Fund under whose leadership, as a Financial Times editorial noted, the bank grew \"into its role as a facilitator of vital investments in the former Soviet empire.\" But after all the publicity of the Attali era, Mr de Larosi\u00e8re appeared determined to keep the bank out of the spotlight, which may have made sense for much of the time but did, on occasion, create problems of presentation. The bank's role is simply incompatible with a low profile. Its involvement in a controversial project to finance the completion of nuclear facilities in the Ukraine - as a quid pro quo for the closure of Chernobyl - has attracted considerable criticism from environmental campaigners. Inevitably, the bank's loan portfolio suffered considerably from the fallout from Russia's partial debt default in 1998. Even as delegates fly in to London, CEE Bankwatch, a non-governmental organisation with members drawn from countries in central and eastern Europe, is holding a press conference under the heading \"EBRD; a decade of misinformation and secrecy\". CEE Bankwatch is expected to criticise the bank either for not giving sufficient information or not insisting its clients give sufficient information about projects to allow effective public consultation. Still the bank can put a positive enough gloss on its activities. Over the past decade it has invested or lent some 17.5bn euros (\u00a311bn) of its own money, which it reckons brought a further 44.5bn euros from co-investors. In recent years the EBRD has focused more on providing investment to small and medium sized enterprises - either directly or through specialist banks. Mr Lemierre is anxious to help the build-up of a base of new entrepreneurs who will help drive future economic prosperity. It has been profitable for seven of its 10 years - it made losses in the first two and then again in 1998 when it was hit by the fallout from the Russian debt crisis. As the politicians, bankers and entrepreneurs from east and west gather in London over the next three days, Mr Lemierre will be keen to deliver a forward looking message. Inevitably, speeches from the finance ministers who represent the bank's sovereign shareholders will be peppered with strictures for the bank to operate on \"sound banking principles\". Mr Lemierre has no problem with that. \"It is very good for the bank to respect sound banking principles. You can't built economies by making losses. \"We are using taxpayers money and, to talk like a technocrat, the allocation of capital must be done on a sound basis. \"If you have a project where you don't understand the financial and economic sustainability, there is a problem. There is something wrong. It would be a big mistake if the bank financed projects that were not sensible. That would send the wrong message.\" Ensuring the future There is, however, a \"but\" - and it is a significant one. For Mr Lemierre, making a profit is important in that it underpins the bank's long-term future - ensuring that it continues in operation, helping the transition process in central and eastern Europe. But the bank is not in the business, he says, of profits maximisation. That, he believes, would affect its ability to take risks and so to act effectively. For Mr Lemierre the yardstick is the impact the bank's investments and loans - and the money of private-sector banks and investors it brings on board - has on the economies in which it operates. \"What is very interesting about this job is the people. You work with people and for people. You don't work for the balance sheet.\" Not that the bank sees itself as a soft touch. While it may not look for a bench mark return on its investment, it is very keen on what Mr Lemierre calls conditionality. This is a tricky area and varies from country to country and project to project. \"We don't have a tool box with already prepared conditions of choice. We have to look at what will have the best impact, what is credible.\" Inevitably this is where the politics comes in. For the EBRD is not just about setting repayment conditions. If it is being asked to fund, say, an energy utility or transport system it will want to ensure that the tariff policy is sufficient to sustain the financial commitment. In other words, prices - traditionally set well below market rates under central planning - have to rise. For politicians that is never good news. In broader terms, the bank also has to make an assessment of the progress individual countries are making towards democracy. As Mr Lemierre notes, the EBRD \"is the only international financial institution to have to make this assessment\". It is also a recipe for the bank to be caught in the crossfire between those who think its democratic mandate is a licence to interfere and those who think it does not interfere enough. The EBRD has ruffled a few feathers in the corporate sector, too. It has had its clashes over areas such as corporate governance and transparency. Again Mr Lemierre sees it as a balance between standards that the EBRD believes are essential if progress is to be made but which must be understood and accepted by those seeking loans or investment. \"We must explain, we must have a real policy dialogue with the companies and countries. The conditions must be relevant and adapted to the project involved. If they are not understood they will not be expected. \"What we have to say is that we are ready to work with you - but there is no free lunch.\" Gazprom is a case in point. It would like some $250m (\u00a3180m) of the EBRD's money. The bank wants some questions answered first. So far, no answers, so no money, either. Mr Lemierre is committed to the market economy model, not, he says, on ideological grounds but because it is the best way of creating wealth. But he acknowledges that the process of change has brought problems. In the old days of central planning there was a popular joke among workers that \"we pretend to work and they pretend to pay us\". These days it is no joke, as enterprises close leaving workers and pensioners dependent on safety nets that, at best, are inadequate and at worst nonexistent. Mr Lemierre acknowledges the problem and says it will be one of the messages he will deliver to the AGM. \"In the first stage [of transition], which can be long, sometimes you are creating jobs, creating new activities but at other times you are destroying the welfare system. \"When you restructure old systems you create poverty, despair and I think in our countries of operation there is a real need to work to address more the questions of poverty, health and education. \"We need to make a bridge between the old and new systems. \"People must know that when they have huge difficulties, there is some hope. At the end of the day people must know there is a small bank somewhere in London where people are trying to help.\" Decade of highs and lows May 1990: agreement to establish bank signed April 1991: inauguration of EBRD headquarters, election of Jacques Attali as president June 1991: first loan approved November 1991: first regional office, in Warsaw April 1992: first annual meeting - in Budapest April 1993: scandal over 'extravagance' breaks July 1993: Attali resigns July 1993: Russia small business fund set up Sept 1993: Jacques de Larosi\u00e8re elected president April 1996: shareholders agree to double bank's capital to 20bn euros June 1996: Bosnia Herzegovina becomes EBRD member Dec 1996: bank now has loans in all 26 countries of operation June 1998: Jacques Attali retires September 1998: Horst K\u00f6hler becomes president April 2000: K\u00f6hler steps down to become head of the IMF July 2000: Jean Lemierre becomes EBRD president",

The company employs over 2,000 people in the UK, but has not said how many of its British workers will face redundancy. Ericsson, which has been hit by a slowing telecoms market employs staff at sites in London, Basingstoke, Guildford and Brighton. A spokesman said more than half of the job cuts would be outside Sweden. Last month it announced plans to axe 1,200 jobs in Carlton, Nottinghamshire and Scunthorpe Officials from the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union are planning to hold meetings with Ericsson today. National officer Bob Shannon said: \"We have made it clear to Ericsson that they cannot keep cutting jobs in this country. It is essential that the firm holds its nerve in the face of the current problems.\" Details of the cuts came as Ericsson issued a first-quarter trading statement saying it was hit by the general economic downturn and an \"abruptly slower telecom sector\". Sales for the period from January to March dropped 5% to \u00a33.8 billion, while income before tax fell 90% from \u00a3418 million to \u00a341.5 million. A spokesman for Ericsson said: \"The fact is the market in telecoms is hardly growing at all, and there is no way a company can ignore that fact.\" To turn its business around, Ericsson plans to cut its costs by more than \u00a31.4 billion a year, by reducing its selling and administrative expenses as well as cutting its number of offices, consultants and staff. It will also spend less on IT, and will consolidate its number of research and development locations. The cuts follow similar announcements by rivals Motorola, Siemens and Marconi. However, Ericsson\u00cds figures were in contrast to data from the Finish telecoms group Nokia, which showed that profits for its first quarter rose nearly 10%.

This early in their career, it's good that that the band can't be pigeonholed but it also means their set is confusing, and songs range from the moderately glorious to the ghastly; one is a bit Astrid Gilberto, another like Jane Siberry backed by Elvis's 1950s band. One fears for the psychological state of their \"typical\" fan. The songs that sound like the Sundays, such as Peace of Mind, fare best, but elsewhere even the raven-haired singer covers her ears to fend off another discordant clarinet solo. There's real promise here but the Bush desperately need to take a firm hand and sort out a direction. They should start with their next record sleeve. \u0095 The Bush, the Tree and Me play the Old Fire Station, Bournemouth (01202 503888), on Wednesday and the Scala, London N1 (020-7833 2022), on Thursday.",

Referee: Urs Meier (Switzerland) 1 Liverpool continue the hunt for their first European trophy in 16 years searching for goals on judgement night at Anfield. Liverpool kick off and immediately launch the ball long to Heskey. 2 Smicer finds Heskey on the edge of the area, who plays it out wide to Babbel, but his right-wing cross fails to find Owen in the box. 4 Liverpool win a free-kick following a Cocu block on Smicer on halfway. 6 A Babbel cross puts the 19-year-old Barcelona 'keeper Reina under pressure and he is forced to punch the ball out for a corner. McAllister's corner-kick comes to nothing. 7 Rivaldo's 35-yard drive is tipped over the bar by Sander Westerveld. 10 Smicer releases Michael Owen in the penalty area, but the 21-year-old's first touch lets him down, allowing Reina to smother the ball. 14 Rivaldo's ball from the left flank just eludes Kluivert, as the Dutchman got clear of the Liverpool defence. 15 Hyypia rises to meet a Babbel corner, but his clean connection is mis-directed. 16 Smicer's header from Heskey's left-wing cross brings a comfortable save from Reina.

      "bodyText": "The first spores of a fungal trade war are being cultivated in the far east as Japan prepares to restrict imports of shiitake mushrooms from China. Silly as it may sound, the dispute over this traditional ingredient in the Japanese diet is no laughing matter in this part of the world. According to a flurry of anxious media reports and concerned analyses, Tokyo's refusal to make room for the mushrooms threatens dining habits, supermarket prices and the livelihood of thousands of impoverished Chinese farmers. Even more worryingly, diplomats and economists warn that it could herald a rise of protectionism in Asia and worsen the already strained relations between the region's two powers, Tokyo and Beijing. Shiitake are among the most popular of the many varieties of mushrooms eaten by fungi-mad Japanese diners. Each year, families and restaurants stew, fry and grill hundreds of tons of these brown umbrella-shaped vegetables. Battered shiitake tempura is a particular favourite. Until recently, only domestically produced shiitake were considered of sufficient quality to satisfy picky Japanese consumers even though the prices were high as a result of agricultural protection and inefficiency. But from the middle of the last decade, Japanese trading companies began encouraging Chinese farmers to use Japanese spores and modern cultivation methods, which rapidly closed the quality gap. The policy was a huge success. In Fujian province, where the humid mountaineous climate was perfect for the mushrooms, farming families struck shiitake gold. From eking out an existence on $120 per head, they could suddenly earn 10 times that amount by growing mushrooms for export to Japan. Not surprisingly, the same techniques have been applied for straw mushrooms, uckahoe, lentinus adodes, white jelly fungus and hedgehog fungus and expensive Matsudake mushrooms - which can sell for up to 30 pounds each in Japan. As a result, from almost nowhere, China became a global mushroom giant. According to the Chinese Edible Fungi Association, 5.2 million tons of mushrooms - or more than half the world total - are now grown in the country, creating an export industry worth $2.4 billion. Japanese consumers have been more than snap them up. With Chinese shiitake selling at less than half the price of home-grown produce, imports of the mushrooms last year, rose by 70 percent to 42,057 tons. Understandably, Japan's 30,000 shiitake farmers fear annihilation. With the support of the politically powerful Agriculture Cooperatives Group, which boasts 8 million members, they have demanded protection from the government.

Prof King made his statement after failing to persuade farmers' leaders to support the government's vaccination policy after a third day of talks ended without agreement.</p> <p>Prof King said at the end of last month the daily tally stood at an average of 43 new cases a day, while that had fallen to 27 by last Sunday.</p> <p>\"On the basis of the fall in the number of cases being reported, the epidemic now is fully under control,\" Prof King said. \"If 14 days ago we had 40 infected premises then today we should have 20 and in two more weeks we should have 10.\"</p> <p>Prof King had earlier met the president of the National Farmers' Union, Ben Gill, who emerged from the talks claiming that both sides were \"neither further away nor closer\" to an accord on vaccination.</p> <p>Mr Gill said he still opposed an immediate vaccination programme, particularly as the current culling scheme appeared to be working. The government does not need the NFU's support to go ahead with the plan but have admitted it would be far easier with it.</p> <p>Mr Gill denied the NFU was dictating policy. He said: \"I have not yet been convinced of the relevance of vaccination at this time.

      "bodyText": "The foot and mouth outbreak is \"fully under control\", the government's chief scientist, Professor David King, said today after reporting a significant drop in the daily number of cases during the last two weeks. However, the issue of whether or not to proceed with cattle vaccinations was still troubling the government. Prof King made his statement after failing to persuade farmers' leaders to support the government's vaccination policy after a third day of talks ended without agreement. Prof King said at the end of last month the daily tally stood at an average of 43 new cases a day, while that had fallen to 27 by last Sunday. \"On the basis of the fall in the number of cases being reported, the epidemic now is fully under control,\" Prof King said. \"If 14 days ago we had 40 infected premises then today we should have 20 and in two more weeks we should have 10.\" Prof King had earlier met the president of the National Farmers' Union, Ben Gill, who emerged from the talks claiming that both sides were \"neither further away nor closer\" to an accord on vaccination. Mr Gill said he still opposed an immediate vaccination programme, particularly as the current culling scheme appeared to be working. The government does not need the NFU's support to go ahead with the plan but have admitted it would be far easier with it. Mr Gill denied the NFU was dictating policy. He said: \"I have not yet been convinced of the relevance of vaccination at this time. There are many questions which need to be resolved.\" Mr Gill, who had participated in talks at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in London, said that the government was relying on the cooperation of farmers to make any scheme workable but denied a rift between ministers and his union. He also denied that financial fears were behind the NFU's position, saying: \"It is a matter of putting the scientific perspective against a broader picture. The market place is very important to us.\" Before the talks, the union's policy director, Martin Haworth, had predicted that ministers would be persuaded to abandon their highly publicised vaccination policy \"u-turn\". Prof King said the optimistic outlook could now also be applied to the worst hit area of Cumbria. Both there and elsewhere, he said, the nationwide policy of culling infected livestock within 24 hours and animals on neighbouring farms within 48 hours was working.

It sounds decisive, it sounds momentous, it doesn't cost any money, it appeases the Roman Catholic lobby (which, apart from anything else, makes up 50% of the nocturnal occupants of the prime minister's bedroom) and it has no material impact on a single voter.</p> <p>Whether it is useful or necessary is doubtful. There are three good reasons why, if it weren't for the politics of it, Alan Milburn needn't have bothered with his announcement today.</p> <p>Firstly, there isn't a queue of scientists in Britain waiting to carry out experiments on human cloning. Banning reproductive cloning in Britain is a bit like banning British missions to Mars. </p> <p>Paying clients might be found - gay couples, parents of children who have died in accidents, 100% sterile men - but the science is not ready to clone a human without an unacceptably high risk of miscarriages or birth defects in the baby. (For those who skipped Cloning I, clones still have to be born, grow and learn in the conventional way.)</p> <p>Secondly, there are laws and regulators already in place to make reproductive cloning all but impossible in practice. No-one could legally clone a human in Britain without the permission of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, the HFEA, and there are no circumstances foreseeable at the moment which would persuade that cautious body that cloning was acceptable.</p> <p>Thirdly, a Britain-only ban shrinks into perspective against the background of other scientifically advanced countries which have no laws, HFEA equivalents or guidelines governing reproductive cloning, and no plans to introduce them. Russia and India are two examples; but even a country as close as Belgium has no rules to stop human cloning being carried out.</p> <p>Milburn's pledge is more nuanced than it seems. Only reproductive cloning will be banned: therapeutic or, to be more accurate, limited human cloning will not be. Scientists will still be able to apply for permission to produce cloned human embryos for research, in the hope of using their findings to cure degenerative diseases and organ damage. But the embryos will not be allowed to develop beyond the stage of a microscopic ball of cells.</p> <p>If the government's announcement is to have an effect, it will be to cast a pall over this work. Not only that: one day, the science of reproductive cloning may look more reliable, and the cautious use of the technology in specific human situations may start to seem attractive. Leaving the HFEA to make a judgement on when if ever that day came would have been a better move. </p> <p>The HFEA, for all its flaws - it is excessively restrictive when it comes to novel IVF procedures - is widely admired as a model for other countries to follow. The government should have left it to be the arbiter on reproductive cloning.</p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/genes/article/0,2763,475039,00.html\">19.04.2001: Human cloning to be outlawed</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/genes/article/0,2763,474968,00.html\">19.04.2001: 'Genetic knowledge parks' planned</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/genes/article/0,2763,470589,00.html\">09.04.2001, comment: How to live longer</a></p> <p><strong>What's going on?</strong><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,475231,00.html\">The issue explained</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.dti.gov.uk/hgac/\">Human Genetics Commission</a></p>",

Whether it is useful or necessary is doubtful. There are three good reasons why, if it weren't for the politics of it, Alan Milburn needn't have bothered with his announcement today. Firstly, there isn't a queue of scientists in Britain waiting to carry out experiments on human cloning. Banning reproductive cloning in Britain is a bit like banning British missions to Mars. Paying clients might be found - gay couples, parents of children who have died in accidents, 100% sterile men - but the science is not ready to clone a human without an unacceptably high risk of miscarriages or birth defects in the baby. (For those who skipped Cloning I, clones still have to be born, grow and learn in the conventional way.) Secondly, there are laws and regulators already in place to make reproductive cloning all but impossible in practice. No-one could legally clone a human in Britain without the permission of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, the HFEA, and there are no circumstances foreseeable at the moment which would persuade that cautious body that cloning was acceptable. Thirdly, a Britain-only ban shrinks into perspective against the background of other scientifically advanced countries which have no laws, HFEA equivalents or guidelines governing reproductive cloning, and no plans to introduce them. Russia and India are two examples; but even a country as close as Belgium has no rules to stop human cloning being carried out. Milburn's pledge is more nuanced than it seems. Only reproductive cloning will be banned: therapeutic or, to be more accurate, limited human cloning will not be. Scientists will still be able to apply for permission to produce cloned human embryos for research, in the hope of using their findings to cure degenerative diseases and organ damage. But the embryos will not be allowed to develop beyond the stage of a microscopic ball of cells. If the government's announcement is to have an effect, it will be to cast a pall over this work. Not only that: one day, the science of reproductive cloning may look more reliable, and the cautious use of the technology in specific human situations may start to seem attractive. Leaving the HFEA to make a judgement on when if ever that day came would have been a better move. The HFEA, for all its flaws - it is excessively restrictive when it comes to novel IVF procedures - is widely admired as a model for other countries to follow. The government should have left it to be the arbiter on reproductive cloning.

The hard lesson that the big pharmaceutical companies have been taught in South Africa, where they have been forced to retreat from their attempt to stop the country importing cheap Aids drugs, is that there can be no global marketplace without a world sense of right and wrong. However much the industry insisted that the cost of patented drugs was not the main problem for African governments, the public perception was that the companies were more interested in protecting their intellectual property rights than in the health crisis in the continent. South Africa, with the world's highest number of Aids sufferers, was precisely the wrong country at which to aim its campaign to prevent poor state buying cheaper generic copies of patented drugs. Although Pretoria has a patchy record on facing up to the Aids crisis, it was prepared to stand by its right under international trade rules to import generic drugs during a national health emergency. Now, belatedly, the companies have realised the damage the case has done to their public image. A settlement is expected today in which Pretoria will clarify its intention to interpret its 1997 Medicines Act under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. But it will not rewrite the law, as the companies wanted. The companies argued that the act allowed Pretoria to override patents at will. The government said it only planned to use the act in the spirit of the WTO's patent rules, which allow intellectual property rights to be overriden in exceptional circumstances. Campaigners argued that the Aids crisis was an emergency as defined in the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (Trips). The decision of the 39 drugs firms involved to halt the case, expected to be confirmed today, is a big defeat for US and European corporate lobbyists, in the agricultural as well as in the pharmaceutical sectors. They thought it possible to exploit the rules for world trade in such a way as to make 6bn consumers dependent for redress on a handful of easily influenced regulators. International public opinion and a worldwide web of activists, forces which the corpo rations had not counted on, appear to have made them change their minds this time. Now attention switches to a more difficult arena: the case being brought by the US government, backed by the American Pharmaceuti cal Research and Manufacturers Association, against Brazil, which makes cheap copies of patent Aids drugs. They say that Brazil is flouting Trips. The case will go before the nearest thing to a world court with teeth - the WTO in Geneva. Campaigners cite Brazil as a successful example of how a relatively poor country can treat Aids if it has access to cheaper generic drugs. Aids deaths have halved since the government began providing cut-price treatment. Merck and Pfizer, the companies leading the campaign against Brazil's generics industry, must be re-evaluating their strategy. But it will be harder for big drugs companies to admit defeat on this one. South Africa's huge HIV problem, its tragic recent history and the saintly figure of Nelson Mandela made the companies\" case look egregiously sleazy; on the level of hard-headed calculation, it is a relatively small market. Brazil is different. Poor as it is, it is much richer than sub-Saharan Africa; it is a genuine potential market for the drugs giants. More significantly for the world, if the Trips tribunal backs Brazil, it will establish the principle that poor countries can override patent rules in the interests of public health. Campaigners now want the safeguard rules in Trips to be clarified and trade negotiators to revisit the whole issue of patent protection in poor countries when the WTO discusses intellectual property rules in September. Ominously for the drugs companies and their shareholders, the South Africa case and the forthcoming showdown in Geneva raise uncomfortable questions about big pharmaceutical companies' lack of financial transparency. The arguments in favour of patents on drugs, which give corporations long monopolies on their production and sale, centre on the cost of the research needed to invent the medicine in the first place. The companies say they need worldwide patent protection to recoup the millions spent on developing the drug. But attention is now focusing on the lack of information about how much they spend on research, their huge profits, their dependence for many breakthroughs on publicly funded laboratories, the huge sums spent on marketing, and the disproportionate amount spent on developing drugs for lifestyle problems such as obesity in the developed world.

He believes a wildlife park, probably in south-west England where BSE seems to have started, may have been the unwitting host to an infected animal.</p> <p>\"The area of Britain where it started is the area where wildlife parks started up in the 1970s. I have got evidence that every step in the sequence could have occurred, and I know that various African antelopes are susceptible to the disease. We also know that lions get the disease.\"</p> <p>He said the big challenge was finding the disease in Africa. \"We don't know what antelope it was - there is a low rate of transmission from the antelope to their calves, and the lions that eat the infected antelope develop the disease as well.\"</p> <p>In the wild, he said, a disease such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy \"in Darwinian terms\" would be beneficial since it would enable lions and other predatorsto catch older prey past their prime breeding age - \"they then infect the lions, helping to balance [the cats'] population\".</p> <p>Prof Morris said that if his theory were true new controls might be necessary in African states to protect food, though no changes were likely to be required in the UK. He said he had considered the possibility that dead lions from zoos or wildlife parks had helped cause the disease in Britain, but noted that the cats' bodies were usually kept for scientific examination.</p> <p>The theory is being looked at by other specialists who are reviewing all that is known about the disease.</p> <p>The government is sceptical about the conclusion reached by Lord Phillips in last year's report on the BSE catastrophe that a mutation in cattle was initially responsible for the disease, and that the practice of recycling cows and sheep in animal feed sent the outbreak spiralling out of control.</p> <p>The review is considering causes, including the old front-runner that it developed from scrapie, a BSE-like disease in sheep. Other theories include contamination from the remains of beached whales, manganese in the soil and organophosphates making cattle more susceptible to the disease, and the involvement of a common bacterium or virus.</p> <p>Nearly 180,000 cattle in Britain have been diagnosed with BSE since late 1986. Sixteen antelopes in captivity, including gemsbok and two other types of oryx, plus kudu, nyala and eland, have been judged to suffer a similar disease, as have a bison, two ankole cows, three lions, five cheetahs, three tigers, three pumas, three ocelots and 89 domestic cats.</p>",

He believes a wildlife park, probably in south-west England where BSE seems to have started, may have been the unwitting host to an infected animal. \"The area of Britain where it started is the area where wildlife parks started up in the 1970s. I have got evidence that every step in the sequence could have occurred, and I know that various African antelopes are susceptible to the disease. We also know that lions get the disease.\" He said the big challenge was finding the disease in Africa. \"We don't know what antelope it was - there is a low rate of transmission from the antelope to their calves, and the lions that eat the infected antelope develop the disease as well.\" In the wild, he said, a disease such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy \"in Darwinian terms\" would be beneficial since it would enable lions and other predatorsto catch older prey past their prime breeding age - \"they then infect the lions, helping to balance [the cats'] population\". Prof Morris said that if his theory were true new controls might be necessary in African states to protect food, though no changes were likely to be required in the UK. He said he had considered the possibility that dead lions from zoos or wildlife parks had helped cause the disease in Britain, but noted that the cats' bodies were usually kept for scientific examination. The theory is being looked at by other specialists who are reviewing all that is known about the disease. The government is sceptical about the conclusion reached by Lord Phillips in last year's report on the BSE catastrophe that a mutation in cattle was initially responsible for the disease, and that the practice of recycling cows and sheep in animal feed sent the outbreak spiralling out of control. The review is considering causes, including the old front-runner that it developed from scrapie, a BSE-like disease in sheep. Other theories include contamination from the remains of beached whales, manganese in the soil and organophosphates making cattle more susceptible to the disease, and the involvement of a common bacterium or virus. Nearly 180,000 cattle in Britain have been diagnosed with BSE since late 1986. Sixteen antelopes in captivity, including gemsbok and two other types of oryx, plus kudu, nyala and eland, have been judged to suffer a similar disease, as have a bison, two ankole cows, three lions, five cheetahs, three tigers, three pumas, three ocelots and 89 domestic cats.",

Although some smaller firms could technically pursue the case, lawyers said it was highly unlikely that they will.</p> <p>Mark Heywood, a legal strategist for the Aids pressure group, the Treatment Action Campaign, which played a key role in forcing the drug companies to drop the case, said: \"The case was doing significant damage to the multinationals' image and investor confidence in them. The case was also forcing out of the woodwork certain aspects of their business practices they did not want exposed in court and aired before the world's media. They had no legal case.\"</p> <p>A split has developed between some of the larger drug companies and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of South Africa (PMA), which headed the legal action.</p> <p>Some drug firms are now saying the case should never have been pursued. They were also disturbed at the content of some submissions by PMA lawyers, which were a PR disaster. At yesterday's hearing, several drug firms sent in their own legal teams.</p> <p>One submission, which was particularly heavily criticised in South Africa, argued that unless there were financial returns there was little incentive for drugs companies to develop new Aids treatments.</p> <p>While international opinion was clearly an important factor in the firms' withdrawal, they had also realised they were on shaky legal ground.</p> <p>The PMA effectively abandoned its argument that the South African law breached international patent protection agreements before the court case opened, after the World Trade Organisation and several governments said Pretoria's legislation was legitimate. Instead, the drug companies argued in court that the laws breached South Africa's own constitution by giving too much power to cabinet ministers to decide when to override patents and because they failed to define what \"unaffordable\" meant in a medical context.</p> <p>The government recognised that some of the legislation was poorly worded and was preparing itself for a judgment that would uphold its right to introduce such laws but require that this one be rewritten with greater clarity.</p> <p>As the first phase of the trial progressed, prospects of success steadily dimmed while the cost to the drug companies' reputations was huge.</p> <p>\"They might have thought all this shit was worth taking if they were going to win, but they knew they weren't,\" said one lawyer working on the case against the drug firms. \"The best they could hope to do was hold up the implementation of the law a little longer during the appeals and maybe scare a few other governments off of following South Africa's lead.\"</p> <p>South African health officials say they are ready to put the new law into practice within weeks once the legal challenge is finally dropped.</p> <p>But despite international public opinion rallying around the South Africans over access to anti-Aids drugs, the government has no intention of importing anti-retrovirals in the near future even though one in nine of the population - 4.7m - is HIV-positive.</p> <p>It will instead seek medicines to combat opportunistic infections brought on by Aids and drugs to deal with other diseases such as malaria.</p> <p><b>Africa: the deadly toll</b></p> <p>\u0095 25.3m Africans were living with HIV or Aids in 2000 and 2.4m people died of HIV-related causes</p> <p>\u0095 Africa is home to nearly 70% of adults and 80% of children with HIV in the world</p> <p>\u0095 In South Africa and Zimbabwe, Aids could claim the lives of around half of all 15-year-olds</p> <p>\u0095 South Africa has more people living with HIV and Aids than any other country.

Protesters across the globe accused them of putting profits ahead of lives and Germany, France, Holland and the European parliament called for the suit to be dropped. Last-minute talks between five big firms - including the world's largest pharmaceutical company, Britain's GlaxoSmithKline - and the South African government dragged on through Wednesday, causing the court to postpone the hearing until today. The drug companies have now accepted virtually all of the legislation - including the South African government's right to import generic drugs at a fraction of the cost of brand names - but they are pressing the health ministry to rewrite a key section of the law to clarify and limit the circumstances in which it can grant compulsory licences for third parties to manufacture patented medicines at a lower price. It is not clear if the South Africans will give ground on this issue but the government has already said that its primary interest is not in copying patented drugs but in importing generics from other countries or manufacturing them. However, what is certain is that the big drug companies have lost all heart for the fight. Although some smaller firms could technically pursue the case, lawyers said it was highly unlikely that they will. Mark Heywood, a legal strategist for the Aids pressure group, the Treatment Action Campaign, which played a key role in forcing the drug companies to drop the case, said: \"The case was doing significant damage to the multinationals' image and investor confidence in them. The case was also forcing out of the woodwork certain aspects of their business practices they did not want exposed in court and aired before the world's media. They had no legal case.\" A split has developed between some of the larger drug companies and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of South Africa (PMA), which headed the legal action. Some drug firms are now saying the case should never have been pursued. They were also disturbed at the content of some submissions by PMA lawyers, which were a PR disaster. At yesterday's hearing, several drug firms sent in their own legal teams. One submission, which was particularly heavily criticised in South Africa, argued that unless there were financial returns there was little incentive for drugs companies to develop new Aids treatments. While international opinion was clearly an important factor in the firms' withdrawal, they had also realised they were on shaky legal ground. The PMA effectively abandoned its argument that the South African law breached international patent protection agreements before the court case opened, after the World Trade Organisation and several governments said Pretoria's legislation was legitimate. Instead, the drug companies argued in court that the laws breached South Africa's own constitution by giving too much power to cabinet ministers to decide when to override patents and because they failed to define what \"unaffordable\" meant in a medical context. The government recognised that some of the legislation was poorly worded and was preparing itself for a judgment that would uphold its right to introduce such laws but require that this one be rewritten with greater clarity. As the first phase of the trial progressed, prospects of success steadily dimmed while the cost to the drug companies' reputations was huge. \"They might have thought all this shit was worth taking if they were going to win, but they knew they weren't,\" said one lawyer working on the case against the drug firms. \"The best they could hope to do was hold up the implementation of the law a little longer during the appeals and maybe scare a few other governments off of following South Africa's lead.\" South African health officials say they are ready to put the new law into practice within weeks once the legal challenge is finally dropped. But despite international public opinion rallying around the South Africans over access to anti-Aids drugs, the government has no intention of importing anti-retrovirals in the near future even though one in nine of the population - 4.7m - is HIV-positive. It will instead seek medicines to combat opportunistic infections brought on by Aids and drugs to deal with other diseases such as malaria. Africa: the deadly toll \u0095 25.3m Africans were living with HIV or Aids in 2000 and 2.4m people died of HIV-related causes \u0095 Africa is home to nearly 70% of adults and 80% of children with HIV in the world \u0095 In South Africa and Zimbabwe, Aids could claim the lives of around half of all 15-year-olds \u0095 South Africa has more people living with HIV and Aids than any other country. Pretoria estimates that 4.7m people are carrying HIV. Experts warn the number may rise to 7m by 2010 \u0095 South Africa's neighbour Botswana has the highest rate of HIV infection, with an estimated 35.8% of all adults living with the disease. Life expectancy in Botswana has been cut to 44 years \u0095 HIV patients occupy nearly 40% of the beds in the Kenyatta national hospital in Nairobi and 70% of the beds in the Prince Regent hospital in Burundi \u0095 Aids deaths in South Africa are expected to rise from around 120,000 last year to an annual 635,000 in 2010",

What is not clear at this stage is whether the ELFE substitute will be \"s\" and \"z\" (as used, for example, by many French and German English-speakers) or \"t\" and \"d\" (as used, for example, by many Italian- and Scandinavian-English speakers), or whether there will be scope for regional variation.

      "body": "<p>Within six months of immigrating to Canada from China, Xiaowei Wang had already attended three different English as a Second Language (ESL) institutions. And with three different schools came three different labels of her assessed level. First she was a low-beginner in a municipal school board conversation class. Then she was a Level Two in the federally sponsored Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada (LINC) programme that is free for all new immigrants. But after she moved to the province of Alberta and enrolled in a programme at the local college, it got really confusing. </p> <p>\"I told them I was a Level Two. I thought they would understand, but they just looked at me like I was speaking Chinese,\" Xiaowei recalls.</p> <p>The Canadian Language Benchmark Project has set out to tackle this problem and to get everyone in Canada to talk about language ability and level - in the same language. The federal department of citizenship and immigration saw a need for a \"made-in-Canada\" approach to the measurement and description of language skills that could be used across the country. </p> <p>For the past decade Canada has accepted about 200,000 immigrants and refugees a year. In 1998 almost half of those newcomers came from the Asia-Pacific region. The federal department has been strong in providing settlement and support programmes for these newcomers. However, as education is a provincial responsibility, any ESL strategy has been hampered by distance, isolation and lack of communication. As a result there are regional variations in ESL demand, delivery and the participation of the 10 provincial governments. </p> <p>In 1993 the department brought together a group of teachers, learners and administrators to oversee the design and field testing of a national set of language reference points. The group concluded that the most appropriate approach for assessing newcomers' English abilities should be task-based, and those tasks should be specific to settlement issues.</p> <p>In 1996 the Canadian Language Benchmarks (CLB) were first presented to providers of LINC programmes, the only nationally available programme. The aim is that the CLB will eventually be used by all institutions: private schools, continuing education programmes and college programmes, increasing the portability of assessment designations.</p> <p>But what are the Benchmarks? As a LINC instructor I was at first suspicious that just another testing tool was being introduced. But I discovered that the Benchmarks are not a test, nor are they a syllabus. They have become an invaluable means by which I can describe my students' language abilities to accomplish a set of tasks. I can also speak about my students' abilities with future instructors and institutions using a commonly understood framework of references. </p> <p>As a general proficiency guideline I refer to the Benchmarks when planning my lessons to ensure that my students fit into the continuity of the LINC programme. Use of the Benchmarks is voluntary, but with instructors all across the country doing the same, some consistency in programme delivery can be achieved. </p> <p>There are 12 continuous Benchmark levels, and each is divided into a description of communicative competencies of the four skill areas: speaking, listening, reading and writing. For example, Benchmark 2 for reading is \"developing competence at reading simple texts\".</p> <p>Competencies are further broken down into general performance outcomes.

      "bodyText": "Within six months of immigrating to Canada from China, Xiaowei Wang had already attended three different English as a Second Language (ESL) institutions. And with three different schools came three different labels of her assessed level. First she was a low-beginner in a municipal school board conversation class. Then she was a Level Two in the federally sponsored Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada (LINC) programme that is free for all new immigrants. But after she moved to the province of Alberta and enrolled in a programme at the local college, it got really confusing. \"I told them I was a Level Two. I thought they would understand, but they just looked at me like I was speaking Chinese,\" Xiaowei recalls. The Canadian Language Benchmark Project has set out to tackle this problem and to get everyone in Canada to talk about language ability and level - in the same language. The federal department of citizenship and immigration saw a need for a \"made-in-Canada\" approach to the measurement and description of language skills that could be used across the country. For the past decade Canada has accepted about 200,000 immigrants and refugees a year. In 1998 almost half of those newcomers came from the Asia-Pacific region. The federal department has been strong in providing settlement and support programmes for these newcomers. However, as education is a provincial responsibility, any ESL strategy has been hampered by distance, isolation and lack of communication. As a result there are regional variations in ESL demand, delivery and the participation of the 10 provincial governments. In 1993 the department brought together a group of teachers, learners and administrators to oversee the design and field testing of a national set of language reference points. The group concluded that the most appropriate approach for assessing newcomers' English abilities should be task-based, and those tasks should be specific to settlement issues. In 1996 the Canadian Language Benchmarks (CLB) were first presented to providers of LINC programmes, the only nationally available programme. The aim is that the CLB will eventually be used by all institutions: private schools, continuing education programmes and college programmes, increasing the portability of assessment designations. But what are the Benchmarks? As a LINC instructor I was at first suspicious that just another testing tool was being introduced. But I discovered that the Benchmarks are not a test, nor are they a syllabus. They have become an invaluable means by which I can describe my students' language abilities to accomplish a set of tasks. I can also speak about my students' abilities with future instructors and institutions using a commonly understood framework of references. As a general proficiency guideline I refer to the Benchmarks when planning my lessons to ensure that my students fit into the continuity of the LINC programme. Use of the Benchmarks is voluntary, but with instructors all across the country doing the same, some consistency in programme delivery can be achieved. There are 12 continuous Benchmark levels, and each is divided into a description of communicative competencies of the four skill areas: speaking, listening, reading and writing. For example, Benchmark 2 for reading is \"developing competence at reading simple texts\". Competencies are further broken down into general performance outcomes. These outcomes are observable, measurable and teachable behaviours that the student can demonstrate. Some general performance outcomes for Benchmark 2 in reading are reading and understanding short instructions, schedules and lists, and understanding public signs with common phrases. Performance and situational conditions supplement each competency. In Benchmark 2 in reading, students should perform the tasks demonstrating their ability to act on the text or find places on maps and diagrams. The situational conditions are that context should be immediate and personally relevant, short and most content words should be everyday familiar words to the learner. Sample tasks complement each Benchmark and give the instructor suggestions for lesson planning. An example to go with the reading Benchmark 2 is for the student to match a shopping list with pictures of items on the list. Before entering my class my students have been assessed between Benchmark 2 and Benchmark 3 for their speaking and listening skills, but many have much higher Benchmarks for reading and some have much lower writing Benchmarks. Using the Benchmarks as my guide, I do not feel so haphazard in responding to so many variations in skill, not only within the class, but within one student. Although the CLB is not a testing document, agencies and institutions are creating their own assessment tools based on the Benchmarks. We use On Target!, developed in Alberta, as a resource of tasks that can be assessed against the CLB standards.

Prague in post-Velvet Revolution times has often been compared to 1930's Paris, and living in this city is often a source of cultural and social enrichment. There is a huge demand for EFL teachers, and with the likely entry into the EU this will certainly increase in the years to come. Unfortunately, teaching in the Czech Republic will not earn you a lot of money. It will, however, make for an exciting and interesting experience. For those seeking a more adventurous experience, there are a lot of options to work outside Prague. Once you get away from the capital, the country is wonderfully undiscovered, and the people are open, friendly and welcoming.</p> <p><strong>Finding jobs</strong><br> Most people coming to teach in the Czech Republic begin in a government institution, such as a school or university. There are a lot of positions available in \"gymnaziums\" (secondary schools) throughout the republic. The private sector is also attracting more and more EFL teachers and if you are genuinely seeking teaching work then it will certainly find you. Various internet sites regularly offer jobs in Prague and beyond. The two sites that are particularly useful are the Prague Post and David Catto's placement agency.</p> <p>If you are interested in long term prospects then the Czech Republic looks to have a solid future for EFL professionals. Most teachers stay only a year or two, which means that if you are prepared to make a longer commitment, it is possible to find better positions. The demand for learning English currently exceeds the amount of teachers, and the situation looks as though it will continue for the foreseeable future.</p> <p><strong>Salaries</strong><br> Teaching in Czech schools or universities is not well paid, even by Czech standards. Despite this, the salary is enough to live a comfortable life, and often includes accommodation - free or at a reduced rate - which is an important side benefit. It is important to remember that prices in the Czech Republic reflect the lower salaries in the community. As a quick example, a full meal with drinks in a good restaurant, will cost you less than five dollars. A basic net salary of 9,000Kc-10,000Kc (about US$250) per month is to expected for 20-23 hours work. This does leave time for more lucrative private lessons (200Kc-350Kc an hour), for which there is a huge demand. Private schools do pay higher wages than are available in government institutions, but rates and working conditions at these schools vary considerably, depending on the employer.</p> <p><strong>Accommodation</strong><br> Accommodation is expensive in Prague and it is an important thing to consider when accepting a teaching position in the city. Free or severely reduced accommodation is a widely accepted side benefit for foreign EFL teachers, and should be considered central to any job organised from outside the country. Accommodation usually takes the form of a flat in one of the communist designed housing estates (panelak) that dominate the landscape in the outer suburbs of Prague, and are found throughout the country.</p> <p><strong>Teaching</strong><br> In the 11 years since the Velvet Revolution the education system in the Czech Republic has undergone an overhaul, which is still continuing today. Teachers from a western background will find the students extremely well disciplined - for example, they all stand every time a teacher enters the room - but often lacking in creative skills and imagination. In languages, the students have a real problem with speaking, despite often possessing strong grammar skills and large passive vocabularies.</p> <p>Schools are well equipped with computers, photocopiers, textbooks and materials. Class sizes for English are from 12 to 18 students, and the school day usually begins quite early - 7.55am in the secondary schools.</p> <p>Despite the low salaries, Czech teachers have a high status in society and the atmosphere among teachers at school is very good. Younger staff are particularly enthusiastic about embracing new ideas and technology in their teaching.</p> <p><strong>Living</strong><br> Naturally, life in the Czech Republic is a lot different to what it was before 1989. The Czechs are a resourceful and proud people, and are keen to make up for what they consider \"lost time\" under communism. Prague is an architectural delight and it is a constant joy just to explore the narrow alleys and byways. With its enchanting gothic atmosphere, the city quickly intoxicates foreigners and many can never bring themselves to leave.</p> <p>Another intoxicating aspect of the country is its outstanding beer, which is also the source of much pride among the Czechs. Not only are excellent beers brewed here, such as Pilsen and Budvar, but the Czechs are the highest per capita consumers of beer in the world, at a staggering 160 litres per person each year. The vibrant pub and club scene in Prague is another important aspect of social life.</p> <p>Bohemians have a strong artistic history which has carried through to the 21st century.

      "bodyText": "Finding jobs | Salaries | Accommodation | Teaching | Living | Visas and paperwork | Useful contacts and websites Introduction The Czech Republic is an attractive option for those interested in teaching English in Central Europe. Prague in post-Velvet Revolution times has often been compared to 1930's Paris, and living in this city is often a source of cultural and social enrichment. There is a huge demand for EFL teachers, and with the likely entry into the EU this will certainly increase in the years to come. Unfortunately, teaching in the Czech Republic will not earn you a lot of money. It will, however, make for an exciting and interesting experience. For those seeking a more adventurous experience, there are a lot of options to work outside Prague. Once you get away from the capital, the country is wonderfully undiscovered, and the people are open, friendly and welcoming. Finding jobs Most people coming to teach in the Czech Republic begin in a government institution, such as a school or university. There are a lot of positions available in \"gymnaziums\" (secondary schools) throughout the republic. The private sector is also attracting more and more EFL teachers and if you are genuinely seeking teaching work then it will certainly find you. Various internet sites regularly offer jobs in Prague and beyond. The two sites that are particularly useful are the Prague Post and David Catto's placement agency. If you are interested in long term prospects then the Czech Republic looks to have a solid future for EFL professionals. Most teachers stay only a year or two, which means that if you are prepared to make a longer commitment, it is possible to find better positions. The demand for learning English currently exceeds the amount of teachers, and the situation looks as though it will continue for the foreseeable future. Salaries Teaching in Czech schools or universities is not well paid, even by Czech standards. Despite this, the salary is enough to live a comfortable life, and often includes accommodation - free or at a reduced rate - which is an important side benefit. It is important to remember that prices in the Czech Republic reflect the lower salaries in the community. As a quick example, a full meal with drinks in a good restaurant, will cost you less than five dollars. A basic net salary of 9,000Kc-10,000Kc (about US$250) per month is to expected for 20-23 hours work. This does leave time for more lucrative private lessons (200Kc-350Kc an hour), for which there is a huge demand. Private schools do pay higher wages than are available in government institutions, but rates and working conditions at these schools vary considerably, depending on the employer. Accommodation Accommodation is expensive in Prague and it is an important thing to consider when accepting a teaching position in the city. Free or severely reduced accommodation is a widely accepted side benefit for foreign EFL teachers, and should be considered central to any job organised from outside the country. Accommodation usually takes the form of a flat in one of the communist designed housing estates (panelak) that dominate the landscape in the outer suburbs of Prague, and are found throughout the country. Teaching In the 11 years since the Velvet Revolution the education system in the Czech Republic has undergone an overhaul, which is still continuing today. Teachers from a western background will find the students extremely well disciplined - for example, they all stand every time a teacher enters the room - but often lacking in creative skills and imagination. In languages, the students have a real problem with speaking, despite often possessing strong grammar skills and large passive vocabularies. Schools are well equipped with computers, photocopiers, textbooks and materials. Class sizes for English are from 12 to 18 students, and the school day usually begins quite early - 7.55am in the secondary schools. Despite the low salaries, Czech teachers have a high status in society and the atmosphere among teachers at school is very good. Younger staff are particularly enthusiastic about embracing new ideas and technology in their teaching. Living Naturally, life in the Czech Republic is a lot different to what it was before 1989. The Czechs are a resourceful and proud people, and are keen to make up for what they consider \"lost time\" under communism. Prague is an architectural delight and it is a constant joy just to explore the narrow alleys and byways. With its enchanting gothic atmosphere, the city quickly intoxicates foreigners and many can never bring themselves to leave. Another intoxicating aspect of the country is its outstanding beer, which is also the source of much pride among the Czechs. Not only are excellent beers brewed here, such as Pilsen and Budvar, but the Czechs are the highest per capita consumers of beer in the world, at a staggering 160 litres per person each year. The vibrant pub and club scene in Prague is another important aspect of social life. Bohemians have a strong artistic history which has carried through to the 21st century. Throughout the country there are a vast number of museums, galleries and other cultural outlets. The Czech language can be a hurdle for foreigners. It is a complex, consonant filled language. Its difficulty is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that even President Havel cannot correctly pronounce one of the letters. Most people under 35 can speak a little English, but the older generations usually had to learn Russian at school. Czechs are also keen sportsmen and a variety of winter and summer sports are available. Ice hockey and football are perhaps the most popular, but it is possible to participate in or watch any number of different sports and activities. In general, there are a wide range of activities and events open to teachers outside the classroom. The people are initially a little imposing, but once you get to know them you can see what friendly, intelligent and interesting people Czechs can be. For most EFL teachers in the Czech Republic, life without chalk in the hand is an active, fascinating and enjoyable experience. Visas and paperwork People who wish to work in the Czech Republic require a work visa which should be acquired from outside the Czech Republic. These visas are issued on a one-year basis and you will require an employer to guarantee employment before a visa will be issued. It is important to organise this at an embassy outside the Czech Republic. Czech bureaucracy is notorious and it is important to bring all possible documentation with you to avoid any future hassles.

      "bodyText": "The campaign by teachers for a 35 hour working week received a boost yesterday, after members of the second largest classroom union, the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, overwhelmingly backed a joint motion recommending a strict limit on hours. The latest support for the motion puts more than 400,000 teachers in English state schools on standby to take industrial action in the autumn, if the government refuses to meet their demands. As well as a strict limit on their hours and an improved pay structure, teachers want a full independent inquiry into pay and conditions along the lines of a deal recently struck for teachers in Scotland. The National Union of Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers also backed the motion at their annual conferences earlier this month. The motion goes to Welsh teachers belonging to the UCAC at their conference in Abersytwyth next month, where it is also likely to receive strong backing. At the NASUWT's annual conference in Jersey yesterday, just one dissenter chose not to support the motion after a lengthy and passionate debate. But Martin Johnson, the union's president last year, emphasised the enormous power of the motion. Alluding to claims that Tony Blair had attended the ATL conference last week in order to try and head off the threat of a work to rule, he told the conference to loud cheers: \"If the government wishes to break up this partnership, there must be some value in it.\" A succession of teachers then described how their mounting workload had taken its toll on their working and personal lives. Tony Tool from Trafford - a relatively new entrant to teaching who was used to working a 60-hour week when he ran his own business - said he had woken up one morning, \"covered in blood in the arms of paramedics\" after he \"headbutted\" his bedside cabinet following a stress-induced seizure in the middle of the night. Sue Rogers, a member of the union's national executive and head of history at King Edward VII school, in Sheffield, told how her free time had been eaten up by having to deal with a plethora of initiatives introduced by the Department for Education and Employment. The school standards minister, Estelle Morris, told the conference on Tuesday that she considered it unprofessional of teachers to pursue their claim for a 35-hour week. Separate talks about an inquiry into teachers' workload will begin next week between ministers and leaders of the NASUWT and the NUT. Responding to the vote, NASUWT general secretary Nigel de Gruchy commented: \"I am delighted. It shows how wonderfully effective the threat of a little action can be. I totally reject Estelle Morris's claims that this is unprofessional. It will produce good results, including good results for the pupils.\" In a separate move at the conference yesterday, delegates voted unanimously to make parents more responsible for the behaviour of their children, in a bid to reduce the growing number of allegations made by pupils against teachers relating to verbal, physical and even sexual abuse. Speakers in favour of the motion described how teachers' lives had been ruined - in some cases even leading to suicide - after they were found to be innocent of such allegations following lengthy, damaging investigations which sometimes lasted years . In a move designed to win staffroom support, shadow eduction secretary, Theresa May, will today tell the NASUWT in a speech to the conference that schools should be free to refuse to take back disruptive pupils.",

The Department of Health (DoH) inquiry report says Wayne Jowett, 18, of Keyworth, near Nottingham, died as a result of a \"complex amalgam of human organisational, technical and social interactions\" at the hospital where he received the injection. The report details a series of errors including lack of training for staff and poor administration and safety procedures for administration of drugs on the ward at the Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham. It says although the ward had operated successfully for a \"number of years\" that success had led to \"complacency and professional myopia\", which meant staff failed to question procedures. \"Unfortunately, the safety culture surrounding Ward E17's patient chemotherapy supply and administration system does not appear to be all that it should,\" the report says. Chief medical officer Liam Donaldson said the NHS would implement the report's recommendations - which involve an overhaul of training and safety procedures - in order to eradicate what he called \"a rare but catastrophic medical error\". Professor Donaldson said the inquiry, by Professor Brian Toft, identified \"classic systems failure\". But Mr Jowett's family said the doctors treating him were to blame for his death. They refused to say whether they would take civil legal action against the doctors involved.

The focus of our research to date has been on pronunciation and lexicogrammar (vocabulary plus grammar), and it has enabled us to make a number of educated guesses at emerging characteristics of ELFE.</p> <p> Jennifer Jenkins gathered data from interactions among non-native speakers of English in order to establish which aspects of pronunciation cause intelligibility problems when English is spoken as an International Language. This enabled her to draw up a pronunciation core, the Lingua Franca Core, and certain of the features she designates core and non-core provide evidence as to the likely development of ELFE pronunciation.</p> <p> The features of the Lingua Franca Core are those which were found to be crucial for intelligibility. They include: <br> \u0095 consonant sounds except for \"th\" (both voiceless as in \"think\" and voiced as in 'this') and dark 'l' (as, for example, in the word 'hotel')<br> \u0095 vowel length contrasts (eg the difference in length between the vowel sounds in the words \"live\" and \"leave\")<br> \u0095 nuclear (tonic) stress (eg the stress indicated by capital letters in the following: \"I come from FRANCE. Where are YOU from?\")<br></p> <p> Most other areas of pronunciation are then designated non-core, and these include many features on which teachers and learners often spend a great deal of time and effort, such as the exact quality of vowel sounds, word stress, or the \"typical rhythm of British English\", with lots of \"little\" words such as articles and prepositions pronounced so weakly as to be hardly audible.</p> <p> Taking the Lingua Franca Core as our starting point, we predict that the pronunciation of ELFE will, over time, develop certain characteristics. For example, it is unlikely that \"th\" will be a feature of ELFE accents since nearly all continental Europeans other than those from Spain and Greece have a problem in producing it. What is not clear at this stage is whether the ELFE substitute will be \"s\" and \"z\" (as used, for example, by many French- and German-English speakers) or \"t\" and \"d\" (as used, for example, by many Italian- and Scandinavian-English speakers), or whether there will be scope for regional variation. Given that users of \"s\" and \"z\" outnumber users of \"t\" and \"d\", however, we predict that ultimately the former will become the accepted ELFE variant. </p> <p> Similarly, because of difficulties of many Europeans with dark \"l\", we predict that this sound will not be included in the ELFE pronunciation inventory, but will probably be substituted with clear \"l\" (a development which will run counter to that in British English, where dark \"l\" is increasingly being substituted with l-vocalisation, such that \"bill\" sounds more like \"biw\").</p> <p> On the other hand, the British-English distinction between voiced and voiceless consonants is likely to be maintained in ELFE since the loss of this distinction proved to be a frequent cause of intelligibility problems in the research. For example, a German-English speaker's devoicing of the final sound on the word \"mug\" so that it sounded like \"muck\" rendered the word unintelligible to an Italian-English speaker. </p> <p>The phenomena which can be observed in the area of ELFE lexicogrammar are the research focus of Seidlhofer's current work. For this purpose, she has been compiling a corpus of interactions in English among fairly fluent speakers from a variety of first-language backgrounds. This corpus, supported by Oxford University Press, is called the Vienna-Oxford ELF Corpus and is housed at the University of Vienna.</p> <p> The findings emerging from it are similar to Jenkins' research into pronunciation in that they also involve many of those features often regarded, and taught, as particularly \"typical\" of (native) English. In our analyses of a variety of interactions such as casual conversations and academic discussions, no major disruptions in communication happened when speakers committed one or more of the following deadly \"grammatical sins\": <br> \u0095 using the same form for all present tense verbs, as in 'you look very sad' and 'he look very sad'<br> \u0095 not putting a definite or indefinite article in front of nouns, as in \"our countries have signed agreement about this\"<br> \u0095 treating \"who\" and \"which\" as interchangeable relative pronouns, as in \"the picture who. . .\" or \"a person which\"<br> \u0095 using just the verb stem in constructions such as \"I look forward to see you tomorrow\"<br> \u0095 using \"isn't it?\" as a universal tag question (ie instead of \"haven't they?\" and \"shouldn't he?\"), as in \"They've finished their dinner now, isn't it?\".<br></p> <p> These characteristics, it will be noted, are described in a neutral way here, ie we are not talking about \"dropping the third person -s\" or \"leaving out the -ing ending of the gerund\", but this is not the way these \"mistakes\" are usually treated in English classrooms around Europe. As many teachers of English as a foreign language will know, the time and effort spent on such features as the \"third person -s\", the use of articles and the \"gerund\" is often considerable, and nevertheless many learners still fail to use them \"correctly\" after years of instruction, especially in spontaneous speech. </p> <p> What our analyses of ELF interactions suggest is that the time needed to teach and learn these constructions bears very little relationship to their actual usefulness, as successful communication is obviously possible without them. It seems, in fact, that there is a very good reason for many students' observed resistance to learning these characteristics of native-speaker English: like the th-sounds discussed above, they are not communicatively crucial. Rather, speakers tend to tune into them only when they use English in a native-speaker community and wish to \"blend in\" (which, for certain learners, obviously remains a desirable objective) while they seem to be redundant in much lingua franca communication.</p> <p> As far as the implications for teaching are concerned we would like to make two general suggestions. The first and most important point to emphasise is, in our view, the need to encourage both teachers and students to adjust their attitudes towards ELFE. Even those who strongly support the development of a continental European hybrid variety of English that does not look to Britain or America for its standards of correctness, reveal a degree of schizophrenia in this respect. For example Charlotte Hoffman has described the English of European learners as spanning \"the whole range from non-fluent to native-like\", as though fluency in English were not a possibility for those whose speech does not mimic that of a native speaker.</p> <p> Similarly, Theo van Els pointed out in a lecture given last year in the Netherlands that the ownership of a lingua franca transfers from its native speakers to its non-native speakers. Yet he went on to argue paradoxically that the Dutch should not be complacent about their English because \"only very few are able to achieve a level of proficiency that approximates the native or native-like level\".</p> <p> Our second point is that it is crucial for English language teaching in Europe to focus on contexts of use that are relevant to European speakers of English. In particular, descriptions of spoken English offered to these learners should not be grounded in British or American uses of English but in ELFE or other non-native contexts (depending on where the particular learners intend to use their English in future). </p> <p> In this respect it is disappointing that so-called \"authentic\" materials offered to learners continue to be based only on corpora of native speaker use. For example, Helen Basturkmen's recent contribution to the ELT Journal argues in favour of \"highlighting general strategies of talk, and encouraging learners to become active observers of language use in settings relevant to them\". This would be admirable were it not the conclusion to an article in which she cites examples taken exclusively from data of native speaker interactions. ELFE learners (along with all other learners of English as an International Language) need descriptions drawn from interactions between non-native speakers in the contexts in which they, too, will later participate. To some, our proposal may seem to be a recipe for \"permissiveness\" and decline in \"standards\". But what we are essentially seeking to do is to carry through the implications of the fact that English is an international language and as such no longer the preserve of its native speakers. If English is indeed a lingua franca, then it should be possible to describe it as such without prejudice. And that may well be the biggest challenge for ELFE in the 21st Century.</p>",

Using English as a lingua franca in Europe does not inhibit linguistic diversity, and it unites more than it divides, simply because it may be \"owned\" by all Europeans - not as a cultural symbol, but a means of enabling understanding.",

Now researchers at the University of Tennessee have found a method of killing germs which has yet to receive any hyperbole. But if it lives up to its promise, a luminous blue gas called cold plasma will be the bactericide of the 21st century. </p> <p>A plasma is a gas in which the atoms have had outer electrons stripped away. One way of creating a plasma is to heat a gas to a very high temperature, generally over 3,000C (5,432F). The surface of the sun is hot plasma, and so is the glowing core of lightning. Plasma can also be made at lower temperatures with electricity. Fluorescent lights and the lightning globes sold as novelties use an electric current to ionise gas. Both of these work at low pressure; crack a strip light and it will implode with a popping sound. </p> <p>A relatively recent discovery is One Atmosphere Uniform Glow Discharge Plasma. In other words, a means of steadily creating plasma at room temperature and pressure. The device itself is essentially quite simple and can consist of little more than a pair of insulated metal terminals powered by a high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current. The electric field ionises the air between the terminals, creating plasma. </p> <p>Professor Kimberly Kelly- Wintenburg of the University of Tennessee believes that the highly reactive components of cold plasma make it an ideal sterilising agent. Her company, Atmospheric Glow Technologies, is researching this application. </p> <p>Existing methods of killing bacteria all have disadvantages. Bacteria are tough. Some can go into suspended animation, covering themselves with a thick membrane to form bacterial spores, which are tougher still. They can survive boiling temperatures for hours. The standard methods of killing them are with extremes of chemicals, heat and radiation. Chemicals can be highly effective: strong household bleach really will kill all known germs. </p> <p>However, the action which makes chemicals so effective also makes even mild chemical agents hazardous to humans. A friend once demonstrated this by putting her contact lenses in without rinsing them after cleaning; she was blinded for days. Sterilising agents like chlorine, formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide are all noxious substances. </p> <p>Surgical instruments are sterilised by heat treatment, which leaves no dangerous chemical residues. Hospitals commonly use an autoclave for this purpose, a steam chamber which maintains a temperature of 121C (250F) at high pressure for 20 minutes. This is more efficient than dry sterilisation which takes two hours at temperatures of over 160C (320F). </p> <p>Radiation is a more modern development. Ultraviolet light kills bacteria, effectively sunburning them into extinction. However, it is only useful for smooth surfaces without cracks which could harbour microbes. Hard gamma radiation is far more powerful, but it is controversial and can damage some materials. Cold plasma offers a gentler alternative. It contains a mixture of reactive components, particularly monatomic oxygen and nitrogen oxides. These act by disrupting the cellular membrane of bacteria. Prof Kelly-Wintenberg has carried out tests showing that high concentrations of E coli bacteria could be killed in five to 15 seconds. Even when the bacteria were embedded in a gel the time taken was only two minutes. </p> <p>Like an autoclave, the prototype cold plasma sterilisation unit is the size of a microwave oven, but with the added ability to treat plastic containers and other items that would melt with heat sterilisation. Another proposed use is to pipe away the monatomic oxygen from cold plasma and for hosing down vehicles and equipment. This is less effective than using the plasma directly, but would have obvious uses in situations like the current foot and mouth outbreak. Viruses, like foot and mouth, are much more vulnerable than bacterial spores. </p> <p>Air conditioning systems are notorious for harbouring large numbers of microbes. Legionnaire's disease is caused by a pneumonia bacterium which can thrive on damp surfaces, and sick building syndrome is believed by some to be caused by a cocktail of bacteria and fungi infesting air vents. It is also a feature of air travel that passengers are exposed to air which is repeatedly recirculated. If anyone on the aircraft has a sniffle, everyone is exposed to it. Current methods of air filtration are necessarily limited; cold plasma provides an efficient way of ensuring that the air we breathe is free from dangerous microorganisms. </p> <p>One agency which has a particular interest in cold plasma sterilisation is Nasa. The quest to discover conclusively whether there is life on Mars is approaching a critical phase. Bacteria's toughness makes them natural space travellers. </p> <p> A Surveyor probe which landed on the moon in 1967 was brought back by Apollo astronauts, and astonishingly was found to be harbouring streptococci bacteria which had hitched a ride to the moon and back - and survived. Any space probe sent to Mars should not itself be carrying any bacterial contamination. Otherwise the exciting discovery of Martian bacteria may be followed a few months later by the revelation that the microbes were actually of earthly origin. </p> <p>A space probe is a mass of sensitive electronic equipment. The outside may be able to survive the rigours of space, but Nasa would sooner avoid having its circuit boards baked, irradiated or dunked in corrosive bleach to ensure they are free from bacteria. Cold plasma looks like an attractive option, as it has been shown to sterilise microelectronic components without harm. </p> <p>The Mars bacteria issue goes both ways. When a Mars mission does finally bring back rock samples to earth, scientists would love to find signs of bacteria. Live bacteria, however, would be a different matter. They might not be harmful. But there is a risk that, arriving in the warm, moist atmosphere of earth these alien microbes would multiply rapidly. Nobody could predict the impact of such bacteria in an ecosystem with no natural resistance to them. In HG Wells' War Of the Worlds, the Martian invaders were killed off by earthly diseases; it would be unfortunate if we were wiped out by a Martian plague. </p> <p>Prof Kelly-Wintenburg will continue this autumn with toxicity studies to ensure that cold plasma is harmless. If these are successful, then the technology should soon be available for general use.</p>",

Another proposed use is to pipe away the monatomic oxygen from cold plasma and for hosing down vehicles and equipment. This is less effective than using the plasma directly, but would have obvious uses in situations like the current foot and mouth outbreak. Viruses, like foot and mouth, are much more vulnerable than bacterial spores. Air conditioning systems are notorious for harbouring large numbers of microbes. Legionnaire's disease is caused by a pneumonia bacterium which can thrive on damp surfaces, and sick building syndrome is believed by some to be caused by a cocktail of bacteria and fungi infesting air vents. It is also a feature of air travel that passengers are exposed to air which is repeatedly recirculated. If anyone on the aircraft has a sniffle, everyone is exposed to it. Current methods of air filtration are necessarily limited; cold plasma provides an efficient way of ensuring that the air we breathe is free from dangerous microorganisms. One agency which has a particular interest in cold plasma sterilisation is Nasa. The quest to discover conclusively whether there is life on Mars is approaching a critical phase. Bacteria's toughness makes them natural space travellers. A Surveyor probe which landed on the moon in 1967 was brought back by Apollo astronauts, and astonishingly was found to be harbouring streptococci bacteria which had hitched a ride to the moon and back - and survived. Any space probe sent to Mars should not itself be carrying any bacterial contamination. Otherwise the exciting discovery of Martian bacteria may be followed a few months later by the revelation that the microbes were actually of earthly origin. A space probe is a mass of sensitive electronic equipment. The outside may be able to survive the rigours of space, but Nasa would sooner avoid having its circuit boards baked, irradiated or dunked in corrosive bleach to ensure they are free from bacteria. Cold plasma looks like an attractive option, as it has been shown to sterilise microelectronic components without harm. The Mars bacteria issue goes both ways. When a Mars mission does finally bring back rock samples to earth, scientists would love to find signs of bacteria. Live bacteria, however, would be a different matter. They might not be harmful. But there is a risk that, arriving in the warm, moist atmosphere of earth these alien microbes would multiply rapidly. Nobody could predict the impact of such bacteria in an ecosystem with no natural resistance to them. In HG Wells' War Of the Worlds, the Martian invaders were killed off by earthly diseases; it would be unfortunate if we were wiped out by a Martian plague. Prof Kelly-Wintenburg will continue this autumn with toxicity studies to ensure that cold plasma is harmless. If these are successful, then the technology should soon be available for general use.",

      "body": "<p>Gauteng province encompasses Johannesburg. It is South Africa's heartland, the source of the country's wealth, the centre of business and its most important province. It also contains the great cauldrons of Soweto and Alexandria, the townships that figure most prominently in the mythology of the struggle. </p> <p>And Gauteng has its own education department. A functionary there has decided that Nadine Gordimer's book, July's People, published in 1981, is not suitable for study in the area's schools because \"the subject matter is questionable ... the language that is used is not acceptable, as it does not encourage good grammatical practices ... the reader is bombarded with nuances that do not achieve much ... any condemnation of racism is difficult to discover - so the story comes across as being deeply racist, superior and patronising\". There is plenty more. </p> <p>This is the same Nadine Gordimer who for 40 years has fought tirelessly for freedom in South Africa, who has chronicled the fluctuating and self-deluding progress of white South Africa's folly and cruelty and been an obedient servant of the ANC. Gordimer has made no secret of her belief that the writer must make \"the essential gesture\", in other words that a writer cannot sit on the sidelines. And in recognition of her literary and political achievements she was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1991. While other white writers showed their growing scepticism about the new dispensation, Gordimer stuck to her guns. </p> <p>Yesterday I spoke to her on the phone. I wondered how seriously she was taking this rather naive attack. She is clearly outraged. She told me that nobodies have made this decision. But little things like this, she says, have far-reaching implications, particularly for those who fought so long for freedom. She said that while Hamlet and King Lear are proscribed for being introspective, The Merchant of Venice is acceptable. \"So it's apparently all right to be anti-semitic,\" is her conclusion. In that widening of the attack, I detect a certain despair. </p> <p>Gordimer once described South African society to me as being deformed by its history. It has been one of her most persistent themes. She also knows a great deal about the complex relationship of master and servant, or \"madam and maid\", as it was ironically termed in South Africa. </p> <p>July's People is set in a time when revolution is in the air, and the Smales have to take refuge with their servant, July. The consequences, as might be imagined, are deep and revealing. July proves to have unexpected qualities, some of them rather dictatorial. He appropriates their pick-up truck and their gun. The point Gordimer is making is one that all whites at that time had to consider - how they could participate in their country's future. </p> <p>More recently, her book The House Gun has dealt with some of these post-apartheid, issues. And JM Coetzee, with Disgrace, has probably delivered the definitive pronouncement: whites don't have a choice, they must go along with what they find or get out. But Gordimer's whole career has been built on her sharp understanding of white hypocrisy and blindness, and her reputation as a fearless campaigner for the ANC - she carried out some clandestine but, she says, not too dangerous work for the ANC at various times - has contributed to her huge international reputation. She has become a necessary figure. </p> <p>At the time of Nelson Mandela's release, the ANC displayed an alarming desire to control art. Culture, the activists said, was a weapon of the struggle. In a long, drawn-out process the ANC extremists were defeated and funding for the arts was dealt with through arts councils, although provincial ministers still had some power. In central government, Winnie Mandela was, at one stage, deputy arts minister, a bizarre appointment. </p> <p>Gordimer was closely involved in the earliest debates about how the arts were to be run. I had the impression then that she was for some degree of central direction. Her close friend, Wally Serote, was described to me as a cultural commissar. But when we discussed this, Gordimer denied any interest in central control, although she assumed some sort of responsible limits to debate. Racial incitement, for instance, would not be tolerated. All the while she was encouraging and funding the now defunct congress of South African writers. </p> <p>So it is both ironic and painful that Gordimer should have been criticised by a \"nobody\", presumably a black nobody, for \"not distancing herself from the racism\" ... and be told, \"the whole plot is not feasible\", and \"learners will not relate to this story, as it is an anachronism\" - presumably because \"learners are interested in the future\". Kafka springs to mind. </p> <p>For some years now I have wondered how Gordimer would react to the new realities of South Africa. Two or three times I have questioned whether her allegiance to the ANC is at odds with her role as a writer. Her answer has always been that her artistic life and her political commitment are quite separate. Her novels, she says, contain the real truth: \"Nothing is as true as my fiction.\" A few years ago I spoke to her about the rising violence in Johannesburg, her home. She said that it was the \"revenge of the repressed\", suggesting a sort of psychic wound that was being aired. </p> <p>As she has rightly pointed out, South Africa is a deformed society. In her earlier writings she tended to look at the effects on the whites, and she was particularly scathing about white ignorance of the black world in which they lived. But for all that, I have always wondered if she would one day not be disillusioned. </p> <p>After all, it follows that if the leadership were hounded and imprisoned and that ordinary people were denied an education and treated as inferior, in other words if South Africa was a deformed society, there would be long-term consequences. And the liberal and the right-minded would not be immune. It may be that this particular issue is one such consequence. An open letter has been sent to the government of Gauteng by academics and writers warning of the outcome of \"crude and highly questionable forms of evaluation\". But the danger is that literature will be seen as another minority interest the country cannot afford. </p> <p>Van Zijl Slabbert, the former leader of the opposition and one of the instigators of the settlement between the Afrikaner government and the ANC, told me that you can invent new constitutions, but you can't invent new people. </p> <p>South Africa is desperately short of educated and cultured people. Men like Desmond Tutu and women like Nadine Gordimer are more than ever needed. But perhaps more important still is the need for the ANC leadership to understand that it is in attention to small things like this, small things which may be of no interest whatever to the vast majority of their constituents, that South Africa's future rests. It is simply not enough to cite the horror of the past as a defence, or to see these issues as pandering to white sensibilities, as Thabo Mbeki is inclined to do. </p> <p>I often think of Gordimer in her large house in Johannesburg, 78 years old, tiny, brave and beautiful. I have a picture of her on the mantelpiece of my study. Her side, the side of reason and clear-thinking, had won. Now she finds herself, a brave and committed liberal intellectual, Nobel laureate and friend of Nelson Mandela, being dragged down from the commanding heights she occupied towards the trenches where the nasty little battles are fought. She is a remarkable woman with a fierce intelligence and powerful friends. I don't rate the chances of the educational authorities very highly in this confrontation, but it is none the less a battle that must be won. </p> <p>And it may prove to be a watershed in Gordimer's own philosophical progress which has closely followed the history of her country over the past 70 years. </p> <p><strong>The book they want to ban: an extract from the first chapter of July's People, which officials say is 'superior and patronising' </strong></p> <p>You like to have some cup of tea? - </p> <p>July bent at the doorway and began that day for them as his kind has always done for their kind. </p> <p>The knock on the door. Seven o'clock. In governors' residences, commercial hotel rooms, shift bosses' company bungalows, master bedrooms en suite - the tea-tray in black hands smelling of Lifebuoy soap. </p> <p>The knock on the door </p> <p>no door, an aperture in thick mud walls, and the sack that hung over it looped back for air, sometime during the short night. Bam, I'm stifling; her voice raising him from the dead, he staggering up from his exhausted sleep. </p> <p>No knock; but July, their servant, their host, bringing two pink glass cups of tea and a small tin of condensed milk, jaggedly-opened, specially for them, with a spoon in it. </p> <p>-No milk for me.- </p> <p>-Or me, thanks.- </p> <p>The black man looked over to the three sleeping children bedded-down on seats taken from the vehicle. He smiled confirmation: -They all right.- </p> <p>-Yes, all right.- As he dipped out under the doorway: -Thank you, July, thank you very much.- </p> <p>It began prosaically weirdly. The strikes of 1980 had dragged on, one inspired or brought about by solidarity with another until the walkout and the shut-down were lived with as contiguous and continuous phenomena rather than industrial chaos. While the government continued to compose concessions to the black trade unions exquisitely worded to conceal exactly concomitant restrictions, the black workers concerned went hungry, angry, and workless anyway, and the shop-floor was often all that was left of burned-out factories. </p> <p>For a long time, no one had really known what was happening outside the area to which his own eyes were witness. Riots, arson, occupation of the headquarters of international corporations, bombs in public buildings - the censorship of newspapers, radio and television left rumour and word-of-mouth as the only sources of information about this chronic state of uprising all over the country. </p> <p>At home, after weeks of rioting out of sight in Soweto, a march on Johannesburg of (variously estimated) fifteen thousand blacks had been stopped at the edge of the business centre at the cost of a (variously estimated) number of lives, black and white. The bank accountant for whom Bam had designed a house tipped off that if the situation in the city showed no signs of being contained (his phrase) the banks would have to declare a moratorium. </p> <p>So Bam, in a state of detached disbelief at his action, taking along a moulded plastic-foam box that had once held a Japanese hi-fi system, withdrew five thousand rands in notes and Maureen gave the requisite twenty-four hours' notice for withdrawal from her savings account and cleared it, one thousand seven hundred and fifty-six rands in notes which, secured by rubber bands, she carried home without incident in a woven grass shopping bag with Bam's suite from the dry cleaner folded ostentatiously on top. </p> <p>And then the banks did not close. The blacks were held back (they were temporarily short of ammunition and they had long since given up the heroism of meeting bullets with sticks and stones) by the citizen force strengthened by white Rhodesian immigrants, some former Selous Scouts, accustomed to this sort of fighting, and the arrival of a plane-load of white mercenaries flown in from Bangui, Zaire, Uganda - wherever it was they had been propping up the current Amins, Bokassas and Mobutus. </p> <p>The children stayed home from school but played wildly at street-fighting in the peaceful garden. The liquor store suddenly delivered wine and beer ordered weeks before, two black men in overalls embroidered with the legend of a brand of cane spirit carrying the cases into the kitchen and exchanging time-of-day jokingly with the servants. For the twentieth, the hundredth time, since the pass-burnings of the Fifties, since Sharpeville, since Soweto '76, since Elsie's River 1980, it seemed that all was quietening down again. </p> <p>First the Smales had given the time left as ten years, then another five years, then as perhaps projected, shifted away into their children's time. They yearned for there to be no time left at all, while there still was. They sickened at the appalling thought that they might find they had lived out their whole lives as they were, born white pariah dogs in a black continent. They joined political parties and 'contact' groups in willingness to slough privilege it was supposed to be their white dog nature to guard with Mirages and tanks; they were not believed. </p> <p>They had thought of leaving, then, while they were young enough to cast off the blacks' rejection as well as white privilege, to make a life in another country. They had stayed; and told each other and everyone else that this and nowhere else was home, while knowing, as time left went by, the reason had become they couldn't get their money out - Bam's growing savings and investments, Maureen's little legacy of De Beers shares her maternal grandfather had left her, the house there was less and less opportunity of selling as city riots became a part of life. </p> <p>Once again, for the hundred-and-first time, thousands of blacks were imprisoned, broken glass was swept up, cut telephone lines were reconnected, radio and television assured that control was re-established. The husband and wife felt it was idiotic to have that money hidden in the house; they were about to put it back in the bank again ... </p> <p>When it all happened, there were the transformations of myth or religious parable. The bank accountant had been the legendary warning hornbill of African folk-tales, its flitting cries ignored at peril. The yellow bakkie that was bought for fun turned out to be the vehicle: that which bore them away from the gunned shopping malls and the blazing, unsold houses of a depressed market, from the burst mains washing round bodies in their Saturday-morning garb of safari suits, and the heat-guided missiles that struck Boeings carrying those trying to take off from Jan Smuts Airport. </p> <p>The cook-nanny, Nora, ran away. The decently-paid and contented male servant, living in their yard since they had married, clothed by them in two sets of uniforms, khaki pants for rough housework, white drill for waiting at table, given Wednesdays and alternate Sundays free, allowed to have his friends visit him and his town woman sleep with him in his room - he turned out to be the chosen one in whose hands their lives were to be held; frog prince, saviour, July. </p> <p>\u0095 July's People is published by Penguin.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gauteng province encompasses Johannesburg. It is South Africa's heartland, the source of the country's wealth, the centre of business and its most important province. It also contains the great cauldrons of Soweto and Alexandria, the townships that figure most prominently in the mythology of the struggle. And Gauteng has its own education department. A functionary there has decided that Nadine Gordimer's book, July's People, published in 1981, is not suitable for study in the area's schools because \"the subject matter is questionable ... the language that is used is not acceptable, as it does not encourage good grammatical practices ... the reader is bombarded with nuances that do not achieve much ... any condemnation of racism is difficult to discover - so the story comes across as being deeply racist, superior and patronising\". There is plenty more. This is the same Nadine Gordimer who for 40 years has fought tirelessly for freedom in South Africa, who has chronicled the fluctuating and self-deluding progress of white South Africa's folly and cruelty and been an obedient servant of the ANC. Gordimer has made no secret of her belief that the writer must make \"the essential gesture\", in other words that a writer cannot sit on the sidelines. And in recognition of her literary and political achievements she was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1991. While other white writers showed their growing scepticism about the new dispensation, Gordimer stuck to her guns. Yesterday I spoke to her on the phone. I wondered how seriously she was taking this rather naive attack. She is clearly outraged. She told me that nobodies have made this decision. But little things like this, she says, have far-reaching implications, particularly for those who fought so long for freedom. She said that while Hamlet and King Lear are proscribed for being introspective, The Merchant of Venice is acceptable. \"So it's apparently all right to be anti-semitic,\" is her conclusion. In that widening of the attack, I detect a certain despair. Gordimer once described South African society to me as being deformed by its history. It has been one of her most persistent themes. She also knows a great deal about the complex relationship of master and servant, or \"madam and maid\", as it was ironically termed in South Africa. July's People is set in a time when revolution is in the air, and the Smales have to take refuge with their servant, July. The consequences, as might be imagined, are deep and revealing. July proves to have unexpected qualities, some of them rather dictatorial. He appropriates their pick-up truck and their gun. The point Gordimer is making is one that all whites at that time had to consider - how they could participate in their country's future. More recently, her book The House Gun has dealt with some of these post-apartheid, issues. And JM Coetzee, with Disgrace, has probably delivered the definitive pronouncement: whites don't have a choice, they must go along with what they find or get out. But Gordimer's whole career has been built on her sharp understanding of white hypocrisy and blindness, and her reputation as a fearless campaigner for the ANC - she carried out some clandestine but, she says, not too dangerous work for the ANC at various times - has contributed to her huge international reputation. She has become a necessary figure. At the time of Nelson Mandela's release, the ANC displayed an alarming desire to control art. Culture, the activists said, was a weapon of the struggle. In a long, drawn-out process the ANC extremists were defeated and funding for the arts was dealt with through arts councils, although provincial ministers still had some power. In central government, Winnie Mandela was, at one stage, deputy arts minister, a bizarre appointment. Gordimer was closely involved in the earliest debates about how the arts were to be run. I had the impression then that she was for some degree of central direction. Her close friend, Wally Serote, was described to me as a cultural commissar. But when we discussed this, Gordimer denied any interest in central control, although she assumed some sort of responsible limits to debate. Racial incitement, for instance, would not be tolerated. All the while she was encouraging and funding the now defunct congress of South African writers. So it is both ironic and painful that Gordimer should have been criticised by a \"nobody\", presumably a black nobody, for \"not distancing herself from the racism\" ... and be told, \"the whole plot is not feasible\", and \"learners will not relate to this story, as it is an anachronism\" - presumably because \"learners are interested in the future\". Kafka springs to mind. For some years now I have wondered how Gordimer would react to the new realities of South Africa. Two or three times I have questioned whether her allegiance to the ANC is at odds with her role as a writer. Her answer has always been that her artistic life and her political commitment are quite separate. Her novels, she says, contain the real truth: \"Nothing is as true as my fiction.\" A few years ago I spoke to her about the rising violence in Johannesburg, her home. She said that it was the \"revenge of the repressed\", suggesting a sort of psychic wound that was being aired. As she has rightly pointed out, South Africa is a deformed society. In her earlier writings she tended to look at the effects on the whites, and she was particularly scathing about white ignorance of the black world in which they lived. But for all that, I have always wondered if she would one day not be disillusioned. After all, it follows that if the leadership were hounded and imprisoned and that ordinary people were denied an education and treated as inferior, in other words if South Africa was a deformed society, there would be long-term consequences. And the liberal and the right-minded would not be immune. It may be that this particular issue is one such consequence. An open letter has been sent to the government of Gauteng by academics and writers warning of the outcome of \"crude and highly questionable forms of evaluation\". But the danger is that literature will be seen as another minority interest the country cannot afford. Van Zijl Slabbert, the former leader of the opposition and one of the instigators of the settlement between the Afrikaner government and the ANC, told me that you can invent new constitutions, but you can't invent new people. South Africa is desperately short of educated and cultured people. Men like Desmond Tutu and women like Nadine Gordimer are more than ever needed. But perhaps more important still is the need for the ANC leadership to understand that it is in attention to small things like this, small things which may be of no interest whatever to the vast majority of their constituents, that South Africa's future rests. It is simply not enough to cite the horror of the past as a defence, or to see these issues as pandering to white sensibilities, as Thabo Mbeki is inclined to do. I often think of Gordimer in her large house in Johannesburg, 78 years old, tiny, brave and beautiful. I have a picture of her on the mantelpiece of my study. Her side, the side of reason and clear-thinking, had won. Now she finds herself, a brave and committed liberal intellectual, Nobel laureate and friend of Nelson Mandela, being dragged down from the commanding heights she occupied towards the trenches where the nasty little battles are fought. She is a remarkable woman with a fierce intelligence and powerful friends. I don't rate the chances of the educational authorities very highly in this confrontation, but it is none the less a battle that must be won. And it may prove to be a watershed in Gordimer's own philosophical progress which has closely followed the history of her country over the past 70 years. The book they want to ban: an extract from the first chapter of July's People, which officials say is 'superior and patronising' You like to have some cup of tea? - July bent at the doorway and began that day for them as his kind has always done for their kind. The knock on the door. Seven o'clock. In governors' residences, commercial hotel rooms, shift bosses' company bungalows, master bedrooms en suite - the tea-tray in black hands smelling of Lifebuoy soap. The knock on the door no door, an aperture in thick mud walls, and the sack that hung over it looped back for air, sometime during the short night. Bam, I'm stifling; her voice raising him from the dead, he staggering up from his exhausted sleep. No knock; but July, their servant, their host, bringing two pink glass cups of tea and a small tin of condensed milk, jaggedly-opened, specially for them, with a spoon in it. -No milk for me.- -Or me, thanks.- The black man looked over to the three sleeping children bedded-down on seats taken from the vehicle. He smiled confirmation: -They all right.- -Yes, all right.- As he dipped out under the doorway: -Thank you, July, thank you very much.- It began prosaically weirdly. The strikes of 1980 had dragged on, one inspired or brought about by solidarity with another until the walkout and the shut-down were lived with as contiguous and continuous phenomena rather than industrial chaos. While the government continued to compose concessions to the black trade unions exquisitely worded to conceal exactly concomitant restrictions, the black workers concerned went hungry, angry, and workless anyway, and the shop-floor was often all that was left of burned-out factories. For a long time, no one had really known what was happening outside the area to which his own eyes were witness. Riots, arson, occupation of the headquarters of international corporations, bombs in public buildings - the censorship of newspapers, radio and television left rumour and word-of-mouth as the only sources of information about this chronic state of uprising all over the country. At home, after weeks of rioting out of sight in Soweto, a march on Johannesburg of (variously estimated) fifteen thousand blacks had been stopped at the edge of the business centre at the cost of a (variously estimated) number of lives, black and white. The bank accountant for whom Bam had designed a house tipped off that if the situation in the city showed no signs of being contained (his phrase) the banks would have to declare a moratorium. So Bam, in a state of detached disbelief at his action, taking along a moulded plastic-foam box that had once held a Japanese hi-fi system, withdrew five thousand rands in notes and Maureen gave the requisite twenty-four hours' notice for withdrawal from her savings account and cleared it, one thousand seven hundred and fifty-six rands in notes which, secured by rubber bands, she carried home without incident in a woven grass shopping bag with Bam's suite from the dry cleaner folded ostentatiously on top. And then the banks did not close. The blacks were held back (they were temporarily short of ammunition and they had long since given up the heroism of meeting bullets with sticks and stones) by the citizen force strengthened by white Rhodesian immigrants, some former Selous Scouts, accustomed to this sort of fighting, and the arrival of a plane-load of white mercenaries flown in from Bangui, Zaire, Uganda - wherever it was they had been propping up the current Amins, Bokassas and Mobutus. The children stayed home from school but played wildly at street-fighting in the peaceful garden. The liquor store suddenly delivered wine and beer ordered weeks before, two black men in overalls embroidered with the legend of a brand of cane spirit carrying the cases into the kitchen and exchanging time-of-day jokingly with the servants. For the twentieth, the hundredth time, since the pass-burnings of the Fifties, since Sharpeville, since Soweto '76, since Elsie's River 1980, it seemed that all was quietening down again. First the Smales had given the time left as ten years, then another five years, then as perhaps projected, shifted away into their children's time. They yearned for there to be no time left at all, while there still was. They sickened at the appalling thought that they might find they had lived out their whole lives as they were, born white pariah dogs in a black continent. They joined political parties and 'contact' groups in willingness to slough privilege it was supposed to be their white dog nature to guard with Mirages and tanks; they were not believed. They had thought of leaving, then, while they were young enough to cast off the blacks' rejection as well as white privilege, to make a life in another country. They had stayed; and told each other and everyone else that this and nowhere else was home, while knowing, as time left went by, the reason had become they couldn't get their money out - Bam's growing savings and investments, Maureen's little legacy of De Beers shares her maternal grandfather had left her, the house there was less and less opportunity of selling as city riots became a part of life. Once again, for the hundred-and-first time, thousands of blacks were imprisoned, broken glass was swept up, cut telephone lines were reconnected, radio and television assured that control was re-established. The husband and wife felt it was idiotic to have that money hidden in the house; they were about to put it back in the bank again ... When it all happened, there were the transformations of myth or religious parable. The bank accountant had been the legendary warning hornbill of African folk-tales, its flitting cries ignored at peril. The yellow bakkie that was bought for fun turned out to be the vehicle: that which bore them away from the gunned shopping malls and the blazing, unsold houses of a depressed market, from the burst mains washing round bodies in their Saturday-morning garb of safari suits, and the heat-guided missiles that struck Boeings carrying those trying to take off from Jan Smuts Airport. The cook-nanny, Nora, ran away. The decently-paid and contented male servant, living in their yard since they had married, clothed by them in two sets of uniforms, khaki pants for rough housework, white drill for waiting at table, given Wednesdays and alternate Sundays free, allowed to have his friends visit him and his town woman sleep with him in his room - he turned out to be the chosen one in whose hands their lives were to be held; frog prince, saviour, July. \u0095 July's People is published by Penguin.",

Tonight's 5 News bulletin leads with the item \"The Kilshaws are emigrating, and 5 News are paying for their flight.\" ITN, which makes Channel 5's news programmes, refused to specify whether the money for the flight was coming from ITN or Channel 5, saying only that 5 News was paying for the Kilshaws' tickets. In an exclusive interview, Channel 5's award-winning reporter, Peter Lane, will ask Peter and Judith Kilshaw where they want to go. The couple will say they are considering going to the US, where, according to Mrs Kilshaw, \"these adoptions are seen as normal.\" In an embittered interview with Mr Lane, she will say: \"I want a fair hearing, which I haven't had in Britain and that's one of my main reasons for wanting to go.\" She and her husband will criticise the British press, whom they hold responsible for the row. And she will say to Mr Lane: \"To my friends who sold out for money, I'm going to say, 'I hope you enjoy your money'. \"To the rest of Britain, I'm saying, 'Morally you've turned me over, morally you've stitched me up.\" The Independent Television Commission would not comment on whether the interview was in breach of its programme code. But it is not believed that a payment made to anyone without a criminal record is in breach of the code.",

The National Audit Office (NAO) study, published today, will be seen as the latest shot in a long-running turf war between the NAO and the Housing Corporation over the regulation of housing associations. It found that housing association boards could not be trusted to provide reliable information about their organisations. Under the current system, boards self-certify the extent to which their housing associations comply with a set of standards for the sector. The study found that when the corporation came to validate some of the self-assessments by housing associations last year, 45% had to be reclassified from a satisfactory status to a \"cause for concern\" or \"cause for serious concern\". It pointed out that this system risked underestimating the number of housing associations in financial trouble. The report says: \"Weaknesses in self-certification might underestimate the extent of financial risk in the sector. We were concerned that many registered social landlords (housing associations) listed as satisfactory might have warranted reclassification as observation or supervision cases, had they been visited and their returns been independently validated.\" The report will be used to help bolster the NAO's campaign to get automatic rights of access to housing associations files. At the moment the NAO has to negotiate with the corporation if it wants to examine the possible loss of public funds at a housing association, as it did after allegations of a serious fraud at the Birmingham-based Focus housing association. The NAO's argument that it should have automatic access to such information is supported by the Commons public accounts committee, which argues this would help assure parliament that around \u00a324bn of public money invested in housing associations over the years is properly safeguarded.

      "body": "<p><strong>What makes Carlisle so different?</strong></p> <p>We're the most isolated club in England, and Cumbria's only professional outfit. Our supporters have the furthest to travel, yet they tend to travel in greater numbers than any other club's from the Third Division. We like to think of ourselves as a \"special\" club that stands out from the crowd.</p> <p>Visiting fans tend to remember their trips to Brunton Park and, far from the popular myth, they look forward to their return journeys. We have become a bit of a cult club. We're not Bury, Oldham or Mansfield - with all due respect, they are dull. We are Carlisle, Super Carlisle from the North.</p> <p><strong>The high point</strong></p> <p>Reaching the old First Division in 1974-75. More specifically, topping the whole Football League after three games. It's been virtually downhill all the way since then.</p> <p><strong>The low point</strong></p> <p>Finishing second bottom last season. We also finished second bottom the season before that, but last season was worse. We got fewer points, scored fewer goals and only survived on goal difference. I would rank it worse than 1991-92 when we actually finished bottom (no relegation that season).</p> <p><strong>What's going on at the moment?</strong></p> <p>It's slightly better than last season, but our future is still in the balance with five games remaining. We have played a lot better since Christmas and had Ian Atkins been given decent financial support all season, we'd now be solid in mid-table or even pushing for the play-offs.</p> <p><strong>Are we going to stay up?</strong></p> <p>Yes, on the whole I think we'll do it. We are past masters in the art of survival.</p> <p><strong>Last fixture</strong></p> <p>A fantastic 1-0 win over Blackpool. Eight of our 11 wins this season have been 1-0. We're becoming like George Graham's Arsenal - horrid, unspectacular, but grimly efficient. This was our first win over our old enemies since December 1990, so it was a win worth celebrating.</p> <p><strong>Next fixture</strong></p> <p>Scunthorpe away. Not the most glamorous of fixtures but if we were to win it, we'd be within touching distance of safety. Our last win in a league fixture on this ground was in 1994 when our supersub Jeff Thorpe scored two goals in injury time to give us a 3-2 victory. It's gone down in legend as Thorpey's Match because he hardly ever scored any other goals for us in his long career. I reckon we'll lose, based on our Rochdale form, but we are capable of nicking a point at our miserly best.</p> <p><strong>Sore point</strong></p> <p>Lack of support for the manager from the boardroom; confusion over true owners of the club (is Michael Knighton still in charge?); and a distinct lack of personnel - ie. no chairman and only two directors.</p> <p><strong>The manager</strong></p> <p>Ian Atkins is not that successful (yet) but well-loved. After a succession of unpopular/unsuccessful managers, he has the support of fans who sympathise with his position, but it's still not clear if he'll be with us next season. He wants to stay, but his contract has a clause that allows him to be sacked at the end of this season. Not since Mervyn Day have we had a manager whose name is chanted from the terraces.</p> <p><strong>Will Atkins still be manager this time next season?</strong></p> <p>I think so. We will be pushing for the play-offs, Akkers will be a demi-god and average gates will have doubled. Time to remove those rose-tinted spectacles, I think. But we are due a half-decent season, aren't we?</p> <p><strong>What's your chairman like?</strong></p> <p>See above - we don't have one. Some might say a very enviable state of affairs, but not one that can be allowed to last. In the absence of a chairman, we have a Management Consultant, David Low, who is effectively in charge. He has proved more adept at PR than Michael Knighton in recent years, has met the fans and has done his best to answer their questions. Some call him a Knighton puppet, but he seems to be working under difficult circumstances with the club's new owners (Mamcarr Investments of Gibraltar) remaining a mystery.</p> <p><strong>Who are your rivals?</strong></p> <p>Anybody down the M6 like Preston, Blackpool (turn right) or Burnley (turn left). They have always been bigger rivals than Darlington or Hartlepool, who are closer. We used to call Newcastle rivals, but we haven't played them for 17 years now.</p> <p><strong>Kit</strong></p> <p>The current kit is an exact copy of Middlesbrough's with a few colour changes. It's a little like the famous 1974-75 First Division strip, which was actually in use for six years during the 70s. However, not as close as fans had been led to believe in the summer. The most infamous kit of recent times was the 1992-93 \"bird shit\" number which appeared to have been designed by a bloke with a sick sense of humour. It only lasted for one year, unsurprisingly.</p> <p><strong>Most ridiculous piece of merchandise</strong></p> <p>We don't have much at the moment owing to the running down of the club shop. However, things are slowly starting to pick up again. We can probably claim a first by being the first club in England to offer coffins in club colours. I know others do it now, but at the time it was ground-breaking stuff (if you'll pardon the pun). We also used to offer a CUFC bunk bed, which seemed a shade naff.</p> <p><strong>Mascot</strong></p> <p>Olga the Fox, Olga being an anagram of goal. The modern Olga is a typical chunky, cuddly mascot, the type I don't particularly like, but that's just me. Olga used to be a stuffed fox that was placed on the centre spot before every home game by a fat bloke dressed in a blue and white suit known as Twinkletoes. The fox now sits in a glass cabinet in the club's reception area and there is supposed to be a curse on any one who moves her. Personally, I'd like to see the centre-spot ceremony revived, if only as an alternative to the modern Olga.</p> <p><strong>Players rated</strong></p> <p>Scott Dobie is our current most valuable player, which means he'll be sold as soon as possible, which in this case means the end of the season. Arsenal, Watford, Preston and Motherwell are all interested. He is fast, is good in the air and has finally managed to score consistently, with 12 goals up to now.</p> <p>In all polls conducted on the subject of Carlisle's best-ever player, Peter Beardsley comes out top. He began his professional career at Brunton Park and was always a 100% trier, as well as his outrageous skill. You could see then that he would go on to the highest level. It's a shame perhaps that he never returned to finish his career here.</p> <p>As for other teams: is there such a thing as an 'accepted player from other team' ? I don't know of such a person. We don't worry about other teams that much.</p> <p><strong>Players hated</strong></p> <p>We have had a few villains this season, most notably Carl Heggs and Darren Carr, but for the most part the fans have got behind the players, recognising that they are all giving their best, even if some of them are not of the quality we would like to see. Put that down to lack of money from the board.</p> <p>The least popular player ever was probably Eric Gates. Not the worst mind, as we could name a good XI of absolute turkeys. However Gates was an ex-international and he just didn't seem to care. He trotted around the field like an old pro who was just picking up his last pay packet. Even so, he managed to finish as our top scorer, which was both a measure of his occasional flashes of class and the lack of quality in the squad at the time.</p> <p><strong>What's Brunton Park like?</strong></p> <p>Not at all bad for Division Three, but then again it was being redeveloped as a stadium fit for Premiership football no less, by a certain Michael Knighton when the money supply dried up. The East Stand is one of the biggest, perhaps the biggest, in the division. Away fans are well-catered-for and even the older areas of the ground don't look too bad compared to some other stadiums at our level. However it is time to start thinking about more new and upgraded stands as other clubs are beginning to catch up.</p> <p><strong>Atmosphere</strong></p> <p>The atmosphere at recent games (four wins on the trot) has been much improved with thousands of balloons and two resident drummers. 'Who let the Heggs out?' when Carl Heggs comes on (he's normally sub these days). 'Ian Atkins blue and white army' and all the usual ones.</p> <p><strong>Local knowledge</strong></p> <p>The place to drink is the Beehive, which is practically opposite the entrance to the ground. Other watering holes include the Woodrow Wilson down Botchergate, within 15 minutes walking distance. The Rugby Club also provides hospitality adjacent to the stadium. Food is generally good. It has improved in recent years and you get a good whiff of the stuff being cooked if you sit in the East Stand.</p> <p><strong>Fanzines, links, etc.</strong></p> <p>Virtually all our fanzines have died a death. The last one I heard of that was still going was called 'Land of Sheep and Glory', although it may be dead by now. The best one of years gone by was the famous 'Cumberland Sausage'. Two of the people who wrote for it are now working in the media.</p> <p>The London Branch have a monthly newsletter called 'Hit the Bar' which probably qualifies as a fanzine and is highly thought of. Other websites I rate include Dave Atkinson's Reeves is offside again, Chris McFarlane's CUFC multimedia collection and Adam Sheridan's Carlisle Till I Die.</p> <p>http://www.kynson.org.uk</p> <p>http://www.vidavision.com/sports/chrismc2/Idrivehome.html</p> <p>http://www.carlisletillidie.co.uk</p>",

Our last win in a league fixture on this ground was in 1994 when our supersub Jeff Thorpe scored two goals in injury time to give us a 3-2 victory. It's gone down in legend as Thorpey's Match because he hardly ever scored any other goals for us in his long career. I reckon we'll lose, based on our Rochdale form, but we are capable of nicking a point at our miserly best. Sore point Lack of support for the manager from the boardroom; confusion over true owners of the club (is Michael Knighton still in charge?); and a distinct lack of personnel - ie. no chairman and only two directors. The manager Ian Atkins is not that successful (yet) but well-loved. After a succession of unpopular/unsuccessful managers, he has the support of fans who sympathise with his position, but it's still not clear if he'll be with us next season. He wants to stay, but his contract has a clause that allows him to be sacked at the end of this season. Not since Mervyn Day have we had a manager whose name is chanted from the terraces. Will Atkins still be manager this time next season? I think so. We will be pushing for the play-offs, Akkers will be a demi-god and average gates will have doubled. Time to remove those rose-tinted spectacles, I think. But we are due a half-decent season, aren't we? What's your chairman like? See above - we don't have one. Some might say a very enviable state of affairs, but not one that can be allowed to last. In the absence of a chairman, we have a Management Consultant, David Low, who is effectively in charge. He has proved more adept at PR than Michael Knighton in recent years, has met the fans and has done his best to answer their questions. Some call him a Knighton puppet, but he seems to be working under difficult circumstances with the club's new owners (Mamcarr Investments of Gibraltar) remaining a mystery. Who are your rivals? Anybody down the M6 like Preston, Blackpool (turn right) or Burnley (turn left). They have always been bigger rivals than Darlington or Hartlepool, who are closer. We used to call Newcastle rivals, but we haven't played them for 17 years now. Kit The current kit is an exact copy of Middlesbrough's with a few colour changes. It's a little like the famous 1974-75 First Division strip, which was actually in use for six years during the 70s. However, not as close as fans had been led to believe in the summer. The most infamous kit of recent times was the 1992-93 \"bird shit\" number which appeared to have been designed by a bloke with a sick sense of humour. It only lasted for one year, unsurprisingly. Most ridiculous piece of merchandise We don't have much at the moment owing to the running down of the club shop. However, things are slowly starting to pick up again. We can probably claim a first by being the first club in England to offer coffins in club colours. I know others do it now, but at the time it was ground-breaking stuff (if you'll pardon the pun). We also used to offer a CUFC bunk bed, which seemed a shade naff. Mascot Olga the Fox, Olga being an anagram of goal. The modern Olga is a typical chunky, cuddly mascot, the type I don't particularly like, but that's just me. Olga used to be a stuffed fox that was placed on the centre spot before every home game by a fat bloke dressed in a blue and white suit known as Twinkletoes. The fox now sits in a glass cabinet in the club's reception area and there is supposed to be a curse on any one who moves her. Personally, I'd like to see the centre-spot ceremony revived, if only as an alternative to the modern Olga. Players rated Scott Dobie is our current most valuable player, which means he'll be sold as soon as possible, which in this case means the end of the season. Arsenal, Watford, Preston and Motherwell are all interested. He is fast, is good in the air and has finally managed to score consistently, with 12 goals up to now. In all polls conducted on the subject of Carlisle's best-ever player, Peter Beardsley comes out top. He began his professional career at Brunton Park and was always a 100% trier, as well as his outrageous skill. You could see then that he would go on to the highest level. It's a shame perhaps that he never returned to finish his career here. As for other teams: is there such a thing as an 'accepted player from other team' ? I don't know of such a person. We don't worry about other teams that much. Players hated We have had a few villains this season, most notably Carl Heggs and Darren Carr, but for the most part the fans have got behind the players, recognising that they are all giving their best, even if some of them are not of the quality we would like to see. Put that down to lack of money from the board. The least popular player ever was probably Eric Gates. Not the worst mind, as we could name a good XI of absolute turkeys. However Gates was an ex-international and he just didn't seem to care. He trotted around the field like an old pro who was just picking up his last pay packet. Even so, he managed to finish as our top scorer, which was both a measure of his occasional flashes of class and the lack of quality in the squad at the time. What's Brunton Park like? Not at all bad for Division Three, but then again it was being redeveloped as a stadium fit for Premiership football no less, by a certain Michael Knighton when the money supply dried up. The East Stand is one of the biggest, perhaps the biggest, in the division. Away fans are well-catered-for and even the older areas of the ground don't look too bad compared to some other stadiums at our level. However it is time to start thinking about more new and upgraded stands as other clubs are beginning to catch up. Atmosphere The atmosphere at recent games (four wins on the trot) has been much improved with thousands of balloons and two resident drummers. 'Who let the Heggs out?' when Carl Heggs comes on (he's normally sub these days). 'Ian Atkins blue and white army' and all the usual ones. Local knowledge The place to drink is the Beehive, which is practically opposite the entrance to the ground. Other watering holes include the Woodrow Wilson down Botchergate, within 15 minutes walking distance. The Rugby Club also provides hospitality adjacent to the stadium. Food is generally good. It has improved in recent years and you get a good whiff of the stuff being cooked if you sit in the East Stand. Fanzines, links, etc. Virtually all our fanzines have died a death. The last one I heard of that was still going was called 'Land of Sheep and Glory', although it may be dead by now. The best one of years gone by was the famous 'Cumberland Sausage'. Two of the people who wrote for it are now working in the media. The London Branch have a monthly newsletter called 'Hit the Bar' which probably qualifies as a fanzine and is highly thought of. Other websites I rate include Dave Atkinson's Reeves is offside again, Chris McFarlane's CUFC multimedia collection and Adam Sheridan's Carlisle Till I Die. http://www.kynson.org.uk http://www.vidavision.com/sports/chrismc2/Idrivehome.html http://www.carlisletillidie.co.uk",

As Foreign Secretary I see every day the importance of our relations with foreign countries to the strength of our economy, to the security of our nation, to the safety of our people against organised crime, even to the health of our environment. A globalised world demands more foreign contacts than even Britain has experienced in the past.</p> <p>I also know that we are likely to make our way more successfully in the world if we are secure in our British identity, and confident about its future. That security and confidence is important for the inner strength it gives us in our conduct of business with others. I want to argue the case why we can be confident about the strength and the future of British identity.</p> <p>Sadly, it has become fashionable for some to argue that British identity is under siege, perhaps even in a state of terminal decline. The threat is said to come in three forms.</p> <p>First, the arrival of immigrants who, allegedly, do not share our cultural values and who fail to support the England cricket team. Few dare to state this case explicitly, but it is the unmistakable subliminal message.</p> <p>Second, our continued membership of the European Union, which is said to be absorbing member states into \u0091a country called Europe\u0092.</p> <p>Third, the devolution of power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which is seen as a step to the break-up of the UK.</p> <p>This evening, I want to set out the reasons for being optimistic about the future of Britain and Britishness. Indeed, I want to go further and argue that in each of the areas where the pessimists identify a threat, we should instead see developments that will strengthen and renew British identity.</p> <p><b>Multicultural Britain</b></p> <p>The first element in the debate about the future of Britishness is the changing ethnic composition of the British people themselves. The British are not a race, but a gathering of countless different races and communities, the vast majority of which were not indigenous to these islands.</p> <p>In the pre-industrial era, when transport and communications were often easier by sea than by land, Britain was unusually open to external influence; first through foreign invasion, then, after Britain achieved naval supremacy, through commerce and imperial expansion. It is not their purity that makes the British unique, but the sheer pluralism of their ancestry.</p> <p>London was first established as the capital of a Celtic Britain by Romans from Italy. They were in turn driven out by Saxons and Angles from Germany. The great cathedrals of this land were built mostly by Norman Bishops, but the religion practised in them was secured by the succession of a Dutch Prince. Outside our Parliament, Richard the Lionheart proudly sits astride his steed. A symbol of British courage and defiance. Yet he spoke French much of his life and depended on the Jewish community of England to put up the ransom that freed him from prison.</p> <p>The idea that Britain was a \u0091pure\u0092 Anglo-Saxon society before the arrival of communities from the Caribbean, Asia and Africa is fantasy. But if this view of British identity is false to our past, it is false to our future too. The global era has produced population movements of a breadth and richness without parallel in history.</p> <p>Today\u0092s London is a perfect hub of the globe. It is home to over 30 ethnic communities of at least 10,000 residents each. In this city tonight, over 300 languages will be spoken by families over their evening meal at home.</p> <p>This pluralism is not a burden we must reluctantly accept. It is an immense asset that contributes to the cultural and economic vitality of our nation.</p> <p>Legitimate immigration is the necessary and unavoidable result of economic success, which generates a demand for labour faster than can be met by the birth-rate of a modern developed country. Every country needs firm but fair immigration laws. There is no more evil business than trafficking in human beings and nothing corrodes social cohesion worse than a furtive underground of illegal migrants beyond legal protection against exploitation. But we must also create an open and inclusive society that welcomes incomers for their contribution to our growth and prosperity. Our measures to attract specialists in information technology is a good example.</p> <p>Our cultural diversity is one of the reasons why Britain continues to be the preferred location for multinational companies setting up in Europe. The national airline of a major European country has recently relocated its booking operation to London precisely because of the linguistic variety of the staff whom it can recruit here.</p> <p>And it isn't just our economy that has been enriched by the arrival of new communities. Our lifestyles and cultural horizons have also been broadened in the process. This point is perhaps more readily understood by young Britons, who are more open to new influences and more likely to have been educated in a multi-ethnic environment. But it reaches into every aspect of our national life.</p> <p>Chicken Tikka Massala is now a true British national dish, not only because it is the most popular, but because it is a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences. Chicken Tikka is an Indian dish. The Massala sauce was added to satisfy the desire of British people to have their meat served in gravy.</p> <p>Coming to terms with multiculturalism as a positive force for our economy and society will have significant implications for our understanding of Britishness.</p> <p>The modern notion of national identity cannot be based on race and ethnicity, but must be based on shared ideals and aspirations. Some of the most successful countries in the modern world, such as the United States and Canada, are immigrant societies. Their experience shows how cultural diversity, allied to a shared concept of equal citizenship, can be a source of enormous strength. We should draw inspiration from their experience.</p> <p><b>Britishness and European integration</b></p> <p>To deny that Britain is European is to deny both our geography and our history. Our culture, our security, and our prosperity, are inseparable from the continent of Europe.</p> <p>Underlying the anti-European case is the belief that there is an alternative future available to Britain. It used to be argued that the European Union is not Europe and that Britain could exist perfectly comfortably as one of a number of European countries maintaining a loose association with Brussels. But with the majority of non-EU states now clamouring for full membership, the changing geopolitics of Europe have consigned that argument to the past.</p> <p>Some anti-Europeans now argue that Britain's destiny lies outside Europe, as part of \u0091the English-speaking world\u0092 and a member of NAFTA.</p> <p>Yet Britain trades three times more with the rest of the EU than we do with NAFTA. The reason why over four thousand US companies have located here is because they want to export to Europe. If they only wanted to sell to NAFTA, they would have stayed at home.</p> <p>Europe is where our domestic quality of life is most directly at stake, whether the issue is environmental standards, the fight against organised crime, policy on asylum or stability on the continent.</p> <p>But it is not simply a question of economic and political realism that ties Britain to Europe, compelling as those arguments are. Britain is also a European country in the more profound sense of sharing European assumptions about how society should be organised. The last international survey of social attitudes put Britain squarely within the European mainstream on our approach to social justice and public services, such as health.</p> <p>There are strong ties of kinship between Britain and North America. These are an immense asset to us in the modern world. The US and the UK are each other\u0092s closest allies. But our value as an ally to our friends in Washington is in direct proportion to our influence with our partners in Europe.</p> <p>I do not accept that to acknowledge our European identity diminishes our Britishness. Nor do I accept that membership of the European Union is a threat to our national identity.</p> <p>None of our European partners, with their own proud national traditions, seem afflicted by this self-doubt and insecurity. The idea that the French, the Germans or the Spanish are attempting to erase their national identities by constructing a \u0091country called Europe\u0092 is the mother of all Euromyths. On the contrary, our partners see their membership of a successful European Union as underwriting, not undermining, their assertion of national identity.</p> <p>For France, Germany and Italy, the European Community was central to the renewal of their nations and the regeneration of their economies in the post-War period. To Spain, Portugal and Greece, joining the European Community was an affirmation of their freedom from fascism and a guarantee of a democratic future. To Austria and Finland, joining the European Community was a celebration of the end of the Cold War, which enabled them to make a free choice in their national orientation.</p> <p>The same is true of the dozen new candidates for membership from the former communist bloc. All of them aspire to membership of the European Union because it will be an affirmation of their regained independence. None of them see it as a threat to their national identity.</p> <p>Ireland joined at the same time as Britain. Its period of membership has transformed Ireland into a country with a dynamic economy and a cosmopolitan society. The result has been a new assertiveness of national identity, and confidence in their culture. We can see that for ourselves in Britain through the new affection for Irish music and dance, and the attachment to Irish pubs.</p> <p>Britain has everything to gain from being a leading partner in a strong Europe. All we have to lose is the timidity which prevents us from embracing our European destiny and from recognising that it is a source of confidence in our nation\u0092s future.</p> <p>In the aftermath of Nice, it is clearer than ever that a strong Europe requires strong nations. With the accession of up to twelve new member states, the European Union is set to become even more diverse. In the next Inter-Governmental Conference, the challenge is to find the right balance between European and national decision-making and to enhance the EU's legitimacy by harnessing the democratic traditions of its member states.</p> <p>This is a debate that Britain can play a pivotal role in shaping. But we can only do so if we reject insular nationalism and the politics of fear by engaging fully and confidently in Europe.</p> <p><b>Britishness and devolution</b></p> <p>The last of the three perceived threats to Britishness is the new flexibility in our modern constitution.</p> <p>The devolution of power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will stand the test of time as one of this Government\u0092s most radical and significant achievements. The creation of a Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly allows both nations to choose the policies that are right for them through their own democratic structures. In Northern Ireland, devolution was needed for a different reason - to enable the communities of a divided society to share power and to work together to build a common future. In all three cases, I am convinced that our reforms were essential.</p> <p>Let us put to bed the scare stories about devolution leading to the \u0091Death of Britain\u0092. Devolution has been a success for Scotland and for Wales, but it has also been a success for Britain. The votes for devolution in the referendums were not votes for separation. They were votes to remain in the United Kingdom with a new constitutional settlement. By recognising the United Kingdom\u0092s diversity, devolution has guaranteed its future. It is striking that today opinion polls in Scotland show that support for separation from the rest of Britain is lower than at the time of the referendum four years ago.</p> <p>Centuries of living together and working together have created enduring bonds between each of the constituent nations that make up Britain. Our future together in a single state is all the more secure if we each respect the distinctive identity that makes some of us Scottish and others Welsh or English. That mutual respect strengthens our common identity as British.</p> <p>Our peoples already practise this \u0091subsidiarity of identity\u0092 in their expressions of sporting loyalty. They watch Scotland, England, Wales or Northern Ireland at football. They cheer for the British team in the Olympics. And they support Europe at golf in the Ryder Cup. In context, each is a valid expression of our identity.</p> <p>We should not fear the consequences of applying this principle in political life. In Scotland, the legal and educational systems are important expressions of Scottishness. At a British level, there is a strong attachment to institutions such as the National Health Service, the BBC and the armed forces. In Europe, we work with fourteen other nations to build the Single Market and to use our joint strength in trade negotiations. Action at one level does not invalidate our commitment to work at the other levels. On the contrary, they reinforce each other.</p> <p>I get impatient when I see opinion polls that ask respondents whether they feel more Scottish or English than British, or more British than European, as if these choices were mutually exclusive. Identity is not a finite substance to be shared out between competing loyalties. It embraces numerous dimensions, each of which serves to amplify and reinforce the others.</p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p>In our thousand years of history, the homogeneity of British identity that some people assume to be the norm was confined to a relatively brief period. It lasted from the Victorian era of imperial expansion to the aftermath of the Second World War and depended on the unifying force of those two extraordinary experiences. The diversity of modern Britain expressed through devolution and multiculturalism is more consistent with the historical experience of our islands.</p> <p>Far from making Britishness redundant, it makes the need for a shared framework of values and institutions all the more relevant. To act as a unifying force, that framework must be one that reflects the realities of contemporary Britain.</p> <p>It is natural for every nation to be proud of its identity. We should be proud to be British. But we should be proud of the real Britain of the modern age.</p> <p>Proud that the strength of the British character reflects the influences of the many different communities who have made their home here over the centuries. Proud that openness, mutual respect and generosity of spirit are essential British values.</p> <p>We should be proud that those British values have made Britain a successful multi-ethnic society. We should welcome that pluralism as a unique asset for Britain in a modern world where our prosperity, our security and our influence depend on the health of our relations with other peoples around the globe.</p> <p>Tolerance is important, but it is not enough. We should celebrate the enormous contribution of the many communities in Britain to strengthening our economy, to supporting our public services, and to enriching our culture and cuisine. And we should recognise that its diversity is part of the reason why Britain is a great place to live.</p>",

Chicken tikka masala, he will say, is now Britain's true national dish. Mr Cook will assert that \"legitimate immigration is the necessary and the unavoidable result of economic success which generates a demand for labour faster than can be met by the birth rate of a modern developed country\". He will also claim that William Hague has to take his share of the blame: if he really wants to stamp out racism in his party, he will say, he should lead by example and resist the temptation to \"exploit the fears of those who feel unsettled by change\". Mr Cook waded into Tory MPs such as John Townend, who have claimed immigration is unsettling the British island race. He described such myths as \"a pitiful misreading of British history\". Mr Cook will tell the Social Market Foundation, a leading political thinktank, in London: \"The British are not a race, but a gathering of countless different races, the vast majority of which are not indigenous to these islands. \"In this era our identity was shaped by Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, Normans, Hugenots and Jews, to name only a few.

But we want to get them back to the level of two years ago - and hopefully even higher now that we have a 43,000 capacity.\" PSV striker Ruud van Nistelrooy is back in the Dutch squad for next Wednesday's World Cup qualifier against Cyprus.

I was alone with the image of it - and the worry. </p> <p>When Leo was born he weighed 9lb 9oz. \"A real bruiser,\" announced the midwife proudly. \"What is she so proud of,\" I remember thinking. \"She hasn't just gone through 22 hours labour to have him sucked out with a sterilised Dyson attachment.\" I spent the next few days smugly telling everyone that Leo would soon outgrow his carrycot. </p> <p>At three months, Leo weighed 10lb 3oz and had plenty of room in his carrycot. Other babies were getting bigger, but Leo seemed to be shrinking and my heart was breaking. </p> <p>All his symptoms were put down to a bout of brochialitis at the age of five weeks. This meant an eye-opening stay in hospital; breastfeeding two hourly with no meals provided. The consultant was convinced Leo would \"sort himself out\", and said he had \"seen a lot worse\". I lay awake at night, raking up my limited knowledge of biology to try and work out what could be wrong - worms? In my heart of hearts I knew something wasn't right. I reported the oily nappies to the GP, who said: \"Classic symptoms of cystic fibrosis ... but don't worry, I'm sure it's nothing serious.\" Yes, I did go home and worry my socks off and yes I did go home and grab every book with any fleeting reference to CF. That was a mistake: \"... but now CF sufferers can live up to the age of 30 ...\"; \"... are generally unhealthy ...\"; \"... all males are sterile ...\" </p> <p>I cried on the phone to various people, who all reassured me he must be OK - no babies had slipped through the Guthrie heel prick test (done at birth) for years. I relayed my horror to the consultant who called Leo \"fatty\" and offered to arrange a \"sweat test\", which is the diagnostic tool for CF. The technician cheerily informed me that they assume the results will be normal; any problems and the whole world is phoned. I walked away and knew they would phone. </p> <p>Finally, Leo is getting the treatment he needs and is starting to outgrow his carrycot. Everyone is being very positive, the medical team are the best thing since sliced bread; but every now and again my heart breaks. </p> <p>From a factual point of view, CF is an inherited disease which results in too much mucus being produced in certain organs in the body, mainly the lungs and the digestive system. Hence Leo's constant cough and his \"oil-rig\" bottom - the mucus was stopping him from absorbing fat. The oil became apparent at four months when I introduced bottle feeding; apparently the fat in powdered milk is harder to digest than in breast milk. </p> <p>CF is the UK's most common life-threatening disease, affecting more than 7,000 people. Genetically, both parents must be carrying the defective gene that causes CF, but even then you must be unlucky: you then have a one in four chance of your child being born with the disease. </p> <p>I sometimes wonder: \"What if we had had sex the night before or the next night?\" The sexual lottery might not have thrown up CF ... But I've also come to realise that Leo's genetic combination also contains ... Leo. His placid, patient, smiley warmth. </p> <p>We have seen the funny side: \"life begins at 40\", \"he won't have to worry about a pension\". We have to be positive for his sake; in 10 years' time, gene therapy may mean a more normal life expectancy - Leo can then expect what most of us take for granted. </p> <p>\u0095 For more information, call the Cystic Fibrosis Trust on 020-8464 7211.</p>",

Sometimes people do suffer bleeding inside the head which can cause dangerous pressure on the brain. But Perry was suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome. </p> <p>Today there is a new form of trepanning, linked neither to old-fashioned bloodletting nor conventional modern neurosurgery. Medical researchers are beginning to drill into patients' heads experimentally, in order to implant nerve cells inside their brains. </p> <p>In Sweden and, more recently, in the US, scientists have implanted foetal brain cells inside the brains of people suffering from Parkinson's disease in the hope that this will promote the production of dopamine, a natural substance of which victims of the disease are deficient. In San Diego earlier this month, a 60-year-old former teacher had holes drilled into her skull in order to receive implants of her own skin cells, genetically modified to produce a substance called nerve growth factor in the hope that it would alleviate the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. </p> <p>In Guildford and London, researchers with a company called ReNeuron are working towards trials which will involve treating stroke patients by implanting genetically modified nerve cells, grown in a lab, into their brains. </p> <p>The first two methods have their critics. The results of the US Parkinson's trial have been sobering: a minority of patients suffered side effects so severe that one of the researchers said they were worse than the disease - and irreversible.

And thinking of 40,000 people dressed in Lycra and cotton standing behind a line worrying whether they'll ever experience pleasure again. </p> <p>Just writing this is making me feel ill. That dry tongued, winded, ill feeling you get when you know something awful is about to happen, that you're about to go through a truly ghastly experience and you can't get out of it. I'm being reeled in like an unfortunate fish to the waiting net of hideousness. I don't think it can get much worse. </p> <p>And then it does ... my mother calls from Taunton to spread the news that she's coming to London for the race. She's raised some sponsorship for me from a few bewildered friends. </p> <p>\"It's only \u00a3200. No one reads the Guardian down here you know,\" she says. My dad is apparently preparing a cheese sandwich packed lunch. I'm 34 years old, but suddenly I'm 14 again and my parents are coming to watch me compete. They'll probably bring a hamper and blanket. Can things get much worse? </p> <p>The next blow comes in the form of a late injury. I was going along quite nicely the other day, dreaming of glory and beer, when I felt a twinge in my knee. In fact it was more than just a twinge, it was a dull, throbbing, deep pain - like someone was pushing a thick metal rod under my kneecap and was gently trying to lever it off. I was initially surprised. I stood there looking quizzically at my joint, not really connecting with what was happening. And then I understood and I was angry. I was injured. If I could have kicked myself without falling over I would have done so. How could this have happened? Did I not know what I had been through? Did I not appreciate what it had taken to get me here? </p> <p>I worked it out. I've trotted 310 miles since this wretched training regime began - 310 miles. From London to the Scottish borders - fuelled by sandwiches, pasta and sickly sweet isotonic fluids. I've endured pain beyond my wildest fantasies, learned more about bowel movements than I'll be able to forget, fallen off one treadmill, had 237 conversations about running (four of them interesting), beaten one five-time olympic gold medallist in a half marathon, been attacked by one dog, subscribed to a running magazine and seen more of north London's streets than a north London street sweeper. In a short space of time - three months - I've become an expert. People have taken to asking for my advice about things: exercise regimes, sports injuries, gardening, origami. </p> <p>Perhaps I'd missed it before, but now I realise the marathon has become the focus of my life. I've evolved around running. </p> <p>So this is where it leaves me. I've not run for nearly 10 days. But although worried, I am also silently joyful; it's a medical fact - I can't get any fitter before Sunday. I've done the best I can. I have to take it easy, take the lift, not the stairs, treat myself to a Starbucks with full-fat milk. I need to rest, relax, enjoy. Besides, surely 90 days of hard training have benefited my body in other ways. I consult the mirror in the bathroom and my lightened mood darkens. </p> <p>I see little difference. Previously I could get by being called slim with a baggy shirt on. Today I'd be called baggy if I wore a slim shirt. No change. My jaw line looks about the same. My ears still move when I chew. I have a split finger. </p> <p>I suppose it should come as no surprise. After all, I've managed to drink or eat every calorie that I shed. My fridge has rarely been so popular - I've broken the handle twice and fixed it with superglue. After all, why was I doing the marathon - for the fun of it, charity, the challenge, to get fit? </p> <p>I break off my thoughts to take in the latest piece of terrible news. The race organisers have made a mistake. I've been given my running number. It's 9,363. Fran, my flat and running mate, is in the 40,000s. We will be starting from different gates - literally miles apart. But Fran's my running rock. I know we'll get round together. There must be some mistake. </p> <p>I go onto the Flora London Marathon website and call up last year's results. There is a device by which you enter an individual number and it brings up results for that runner, time, place. In 2000, number 9,363 was Ian Stidston, then 37 years old and British. He came 1,129th with a time of 2:59:46. That's a sprint. I'm in with the elite. Even if I get to the start with my dodgy knee I'll be ridiculed within five miles. My ears will be flapping with the breeze of passing runners. </p> <p>I need some advice. So I give Ian a ring. This year he's sensibly appearing in an amateur dramatics production. He tells me of the joys of crossing the line, the camaraderie of the finishing tape when stranger talks to stranger in euphoric harmony. He warns me of downs - \"the cobbles at Tower Bridge are the worst\" - and tells me of the ups: \"They give you a goodie bag at the finish and I ate everything.\" He tells me he followed a three-hour \"marker\" or pacemaker round the course and came in 14 seconds under his target time. I can tell he's still happy. </p> <p>The clock ticks. All there is to do now is sit and wait and follow the best advice. All the research shows I should be fuelling my muscles with high-carbohydrate meals and not trying anything fancy. The last big meal should be Saturday lunch, then a light snack for dinner. On the morning, it's a small scrambled egg and a glass of water. I'm going to be good. I know it's silly, but I'm desperate to get round. I want to feel as if I've achieved something: raised cash for charity, toughened up my head, become more aware of my body. I guess I also want to know what my limits are. Can I really run 26.2 miles without a stop? Can I cope? Will my parents be proud of me? </p> <p>There are tens of thousands of other people out there probably thinking similar things. And on Sunday we'll all find out.</p>",

He warns me of downs - \"the cobbles at Tower Bridge are the worst\" - and tells me of the ups: \"They give you a goodie bag at the finish and I ate everything.\" He tells me he followed a three-hour \"marker\" or pacemaker round the course and came in 14 seconds under his target time. I can tell he's still happy. The clock ticks. All there is to do now is sit and wait and follow the best advice. All the research shows I should be fuelling my muscles with high-carbohydrate meals and not trying anything fancy. The last big meal should be Saturday lunch, then a light snack for dinner. On the morning, it's a small scrambled egg and a glass of water. I'm going to be good. I know it's silly, but I'm desperate to get round. I want to feel as if I've achieved something: raised cash for charity, toughened up my head, become more aware of my body. I guess I also want to know what my limits are. Can I really run 26.2 miles without a stop? Can I cope? Will my parents be proud of me? There are tens of thousands of other people out there probably thinking similar things. And on Sunday we'll all find out.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Down in the Maasai Mara, two skinny men are conferring over a goatskin, a pile of stones and liberal gobbets of spit. Kasaine ole Musanga, the shorter by a foot, is an oloiboni - a Maasai medicine man. Cameron Kirk, a heroin addict from Devon, is his patient. </p> <p>Musanga chuckles as he turns the prophetic stones with his forefinger. There are 400 of them: yellow, blue and black, the size of broad beans, all polished by the swirl of the Mara river. But it is not clear whether it is the stones that have pleased him, or something the younger of his two wives has said. She is pointing at the middle-aged white couple, Cameron's parents, John and Sue. They are staring fixedly at Musanga, though their hands are in constant motion; wiping away sweat, flicking at flies. </p> <p>Musanga is sitting in the shade of his manyatta, a squat one-room house of woven branches stuccoed with cow dung. His guests are crouching in the manure that is everywhere, under a fierce, midmorning sun. </p> <p>Knowledge of natural medicines runs deep in Maasai culture. Fathers teach sons how to treat their cattle and themselves with the barks and leaves of Kenya's southern plains. The oloiboni, separate from but not inferior to the clan chief, is a sort of consultant to this tribe of general practitioners. </p> <p>Before battle or a lion hunt, Maasai warriors go to the oloiboni for a stimulant - for medicine to make them brave. When their cows die suddenly - or when anything unexpected happens - the oloiboni finds an explanation in the stones. </p> <p>Musanga scoops up the pebbles into a gourd, spits into it, and mutters something. Then he pours them out again and makes his diagnosis. Cameron has forgotten the bad medicine; but he needs to get stronger. </p> <p>Cameron, 25, puffs nonchalantly on a cigarette, happy to believe him. Musanga's combination of mysticism and herbalism has achieved what years of methadone, rehab and psychiatric treatment could not. Cameron has been clean for three months; ever since his father, John, a retired RAF sergeant, bundled him off to the Mara. The needle marks peppering his forearms and feet have healed and they show pink through his tan. He no longer believes he will die a junkie. </p> <p>Two years ago, the Kirks flew Cameron out to Nairobi, where Sue was working with the Foreign Office, to straighten him out. It was a disastrous move - Cameron was soon injecting up to a gramme a day of heroin, purer than he had dreamed possible in England. Nairobi's rehabs said he was a hopeless case and the police had started using his nickname, \"kiketi [heroin] man\", when they stopped him in the street. </p> <p>It could not have been long before Cameron was charged and given a mandatory seven to 10-year sentence for heroin possession. Even the healthiest foreigner finds it difficult to survive Kenya's violent, typhus jails. And Cameron, who is 6ft 5in, weighed less than nine stone. </p> <p>Reasoning that prison in England - to which Cameron was no stranger, let alone foreign - was a healthier option, John decided to send him back. Meanwhile, he kept Cameron in heroin to keep him from crime. </p> <p>\"They were the worst weeks of my life,\" he says. \"I was watching my son killing himself and I was assisting him. If a dog was in that condition, you'd put it down.\" </p> <p>But even as John was driving to pick up Cameron's ticket, he was hailed by two Maasai friends. \"I told them what I was doing - they knew all about Cam,\" he says. \"But they said, 'Don't bother. We'll take him.'\" </p> <p>\"I wasn't thinking about an oloiboni. The idea was just to take him where escape would be impossible, let him live with the Maasai, and reinvent himself as a man - because they wouldn't put up with any shit from him.\" </p> <p>High as a kite, Cameron was easily deceived. John drove him down to Narok, the last dusty town before the great plains. There he left him with the Maasai pair, and with seven vials of pethadin to see him through the worst of withdrawal. When Cameron realised what was happening, he reached into his sock for a wrap of heroin and a syringe. </p> <p>Unfortunately, John's friends were not the noble warriors he had thought them to be. They dumped Cameron in a budget safari camp and went off to drink the money for his upkeep. For Rosemary Ngigi, who helps run the safari camp, his cold turkey was something else. \"He couldn't walk, he couldn't talk, he couldn't eat, he couldn't sleep. Oh, he looked horrible!\" she says. </p> <p>\"At first we were scared because we thought he had Aids. Then we saw he was out of his mind. He'd forget his cigarette until you could smell it burning his fingers. We thought he was about to die - that's what he was saying too.\" </p> <p>In his six years as a heroin addict, Cameron had never experienced withdrawal for more than a day. In rehab, he had been given powerful opiates and sedatives, methadone, largactol, rohypnol, pethadin and mogadon, to mask the symptoms. Otherwise, the closest he had come was when accidentally locked into his second floor King's Cross flat, terrified by the rising nausea, he jumped out of the window, breaking his pelvis. </p> <p>But for four days, and despite the pethadin he was jabbing frantically into his backside, Cameron experienced a full heroin withdrawal. </p> <p>\"I woke up in a tent, sweating, feeling very sick,\" he says, apologising for his jumbled thoughts: he is not used to remembering things, he says. \"By evening, the goose-bumps had come up. And the next three days were just horrible. I was retching all the time, and shivering, sweating, lying there with this horrible smell inside my nose, like there was shit up my nostrils.\" </p> <p>Musanga gave Cameron a basin of water, sprinkled with herbs, to wash with and powdered herbs to lick off his hand. \"Within 15 minutes I felt totally different,\" says Cameron. \"I still couldn't sleep, but I was relaxed. The sweats had halved, I'd stopped retching and after an hour I realised I was starving. I got up and ate till I thought I'd explode.\" </p> <p>For the Maasai, the power of the oloiboni is beyond question. \"I'm not surprised Musanga helped Cameron because I have seen it many times,\" says Salash Lealo, a local warrior. \"The oloiboni can tell when the dry season is coming and when the rains are coming. I have seen him cure people who were so crazy we had to tie them up to stop them running off into the wild.\" </p> <p>Cameron awoke from the worst of his cold turkey without any such faith: \"But I thought, 'I've come here, and this bloke, whether he's legitimate or not legitimate, has washed me with something and given me something, and I feel better. Let's see what he can do.'\" </p> <p>Besides which, Cameron had no choice. There are no heroin pushers among the Maasai. And the lions prowling around the camp ruled out a hitch-hike back to Nairobi. </p> <p>Musanga has been treating Cameron almost every day since. For a fortnight, Cameron moved into the smoky manyatta to live under the oloiboni's eye. Twice, Musanga took his patient into the bush, slaughtered a lamb, and forced quarts of soup mixed thickly with herbs into him. </p> <p>But generally, the treatment remains the same: a shamanistic diagnosis followed by a draught of herbal medicine. The Kirks say it has given them back their son. \"When he used to come out of rehab, he looked wild, still full of drugs; now he looks like the boy I had.\" </p> <p>Watching Cameron charming his way around the camp, chatting up backpackers, trying his Maasai out on the cooks, it is hard to believe that a few weeks ago a coherent sentence was beyond him. Watching his turn of speed running the hyena gauntlet between two campsites, it is hard to remember that, because of overdoses, over the past two years his heart has stopped a dozen times. </p> <p>But Musanga is not surprised at all. Whittling away at his moustache with his new Swiss army knife, a present from the Kirks, he says simply, \"Cameron came here with white man's medicine. It didn't work, so I helped him.\" </p> <p>Musanga says he could do the same for other addicts - but they would not be Maasai. \"Young Maasai don't do these things,\" he says. \"How could they? They have to respect their parents; they could not fight with them as Cameron does.\" </p> <p>And what are the herbs Musanga prescribes? What does he see in the stones? \"These things are secret because you do not need to know,\" he says, with a thoroughly mischievous grin. </p> <p>John Kirk, an embittered man who has watched his finances shrink and his marriage suffer under the strain of his son's addiction, has transferred all his disappointments into something close to adoration for the Maasai. \"The oloiboni has done for Cameron what western medicine could not, the Maasai have what the west has not,\" he says. \"If I had the choice again of sending my boy to an English public school or to the Maasai, I'd send him straight here.\" </p> <p>Cameron has a more balanced view. Looking out over the endless horizons of the Mara plain, he says his environment must have played a part: it is hard to make sense of mainlining in earshot of a lion's roar. </p> <p>But that would not be enough for long, says Cameron. \"If I'd wanted to, I could have stolen a car and got back to Nairobi. I don't know what the stones are about, but I know he's not pulling a fast one - rehab just doped me; but Musanga has changed the way I think. \" </p> <p>Understandably, Cameron is reluctant to leave the Mara for the temptation of Nairobi's bars. But his three weekends back in town so far have given cause for hope. </p> <p>\"It took them a while, but the taxi drivers recognised me,\" he says. \"They were saying, 'Hey, kiketi man, come with us, we'll get you high.' </p> <p>\"I thought about it - I had money in my pocket. But I told them: 'No, that's not me any more.' To be honest, I just wasn't fucking interested.\"</p>",

The owner of Stringfellow's nightclub and self-proclaimed bedder of over 2,000 women will stand in for that fellow purveyor of controversy-by-numbers, James Whale, on his midnight radio show on April 30. Stringfellow has cut his teeth as a northern soul jockey in a variety of clubs. \"It's a wonderful life I've got,\" he said. \"I have all the toys, man. I have a club full of beautiful girls, eat and drink what the hell I want, go where the hell I want, when the hell I want. If there's a party I just ring up and say I'll accept. \"Now I've got a radio show on TalkSport and my life is complete,\" he added. Related story 01.02.2001: TalkSport sheds female listeners",

However, some countries that are most heavily involved in child trafficking do not have the worst social indicators, nor the worst cases of poverty.

Mr Pendleton believes there needs to be an international effort on a par with the drive against drug trafficking. </p> <p>\"We are up against powerful players, as the money to buy children initially comes from big business. They may claim to have only heard about the problem in the last two months but that is nonsense, we have been campaigning for the last 10 years.\"</p> <p>Anita Tiessen, deputy director of Unicef UK, says: \"It is not enough for companies to say slavery isn't a good idea - they need to take action.\" </p> <p>Christian Aid wants companies to report annually on labour standards in the areas where they work in the same way that they publish annual financial accounts. </p> <p>However, many manufacturers subcontract work so they have less control over labour conditions. Ms Tiessen adds: \"Companies need to accept that the onus is on them to monitor suppliers. </p> <p>Mr Pendleton says: \"In the long term companies will benefit as consumers become more discerning.\"</p> <p>Christian Aid helped to set up the Day Chocolate Company that guarantees chocolate has been produced without child labour. \"Through initiatives like these, we can show companies what is possible,\" says Mr Pendleton.</p> <p>At the government level, 72 countries have ratified the UN International Labour Organisation's convention on the worst forms of child labour and only two countries haven't signed up to the UN convention on the rights of a child. But so far, only Burma has been held to account for human rights abuses.</p> <p>Ms Tiessen believes the attack on child slavery needs to be multi-pronged. \"NGOs can campaign and support, companies can use their economic power and governments can make laws but it takes all of them working together.\"</p> <p>This simple incident of a boat in Benin has provoked debate and brought media attention to a complex issue which is entangled in religion, culture, corporate profits, legislative power and international relations.</p>",

In Brazil, it works with an organisation called Passage House to raise awareness and train and educate children. However, local level activity needs to be combined with high level pressure. Mr Pendleton believes there needs to be an international effort on a par with the drive against drug trafficking. \"We are up against powerful players, as the money to buy children initially comes from big business. They may claim to have only heard about the problem in the last two months but that is nonsense, we have been campaigning for the last 10 years.\" Anita Tiessen, deputy director of Unicef UK, says: \"It is not enough for companies to say slavery isn't a good idea - they need to take action.\" Christian Aid wants companies to report annually on labour standards in the areas where they work in the same way that they publish annual financial accounts. However, many manufacturers subcontract work so they have less control over labour conditions. Ms Tiessen adds: \"Companies need to accept that the onus is on them to monitor suppliers. Mr Pendleton says: \"In the long term companies will benefit as consumers become more discerning.\" Christian Aid helped to set up the Day Chocolate Company that guarantees chocolate has been produced without child labour. \"Through initiatives like these, we can show companies what is possible,\" says Mr Pendleton. At the government level, 72 countries have ratified the UN International Labour Organisation's convention on the worst forms of child labour and only two countries haven't signed up to the UN convention on the rights of a child. But so far, only Burma has been held to account for human rights abuses. Ms Tiessen believes the attack on child slavery needs to be multi-pronged. \"NGOs can campaign and support, companies can use their economic power and governments can make laws but it takes all of them working together.\" This simple incident of a boat in Benin has provoked debate and brought media attention to a complex issue which is entangled in religion, culture, corporate profits, legislative power and international relations.",

The decision, announced in a packed Pretoria courtroom, marks a turning point in a battle by international human rights groups and Aids activists to secure medication for the 26m Africans infected with HIV. \"By the consent of all parties, we would simply ask your lordship to note that the application is withdrawn,\" said Stephanus Cilliers, the lawyer for the drug companies. After the judge accepted the motion, activists erupted into cheers and singing. South Africa's health minister, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, said the government had not agreed to any deals in exchange for dropping the suit. \"You can trust the government,\" she said. More than three dozen pharmaceutical companies brought the suit, arguing that a 1997 South African law regulating medicine was too broad, and unfairly targeted drug manufacturers. The government, Aids activists and human rights groups say the drug companies are trying to wring profits out of a public health nightmare that threatens to devastate South Africa and dozens of other impoverished countries. More than 25m of the 36m people infected with HIV worldwide live in sub-Saharan Africa, one of the world's most impoverished regions. In 2000, 2.4m people died there from the effects of Aids.

      "bodyText": "Poor old John Prescott. After seven years as Tony Blair's deputy, he would be justified in feeling a little spurned by the prime minister since Ben Gill rode into town. Who? Mr Gill, the head of the National Union of Farmers, who was seen yesterday after informing the prime minister with the largest majority this century that his preferred option of vaccinating cattle against foot and mouth was not a runner. For a moment, it seemed like one of those TV nostalgia shows of archive clips, embarrassing haircuts and dodgy music, rather than BBC's Newsnight. Add to that a series of tube strikes paralysing the capital at regular intervals, a national rail network virtually at a standstill and widespread flooding, and it's no surprise shudders are running down the spines of Labour strategists terrified of being painted as a return to the bad old days of the 1970s. To put the current volt-face in context, it was the 1973/4 miner's strike which put the country on an enforced three day week as power generators ran out of coal, and prompted Tory prime minister Edward Heath to pose the question, \"Who governs Britain?\" This supposedly rhetorical question, pitting the government against the recalcitrant National Union of Miners, blew up in his face as the nation answered \"Not you, sunshine\" and elected Labour's Harold Wilson to pull in the reigns of an overmighty Trades Union Congress. After a series of strikes through the 1970s which cost 10,726,000 working days in one year alone, the unions' power reached its zenith, and its Waterloo, with the 1984 miners' strike. After a record 26,100,000 lost working days, NUM leader Arthur Scargill was forced to capitulate. The unions had one last hurrah with the SOGAT protest against Rupert Murdoch's relocation of the Times and the Sun to Wapping, before the Thatcher government brought in a succession of highly restrictive trades unions laws, banning secondary picketing and insisting on full ballots of members before industrial action. Tony Blair's first self-imposed hurdle as leader of the Labour party was to confront his paymasters and the party's forefathers - the unions - by scrapping clause IV of the party's constitution which committed the party to public ownership of the means of production. Since then, Mr Blair has not looked kindly on the unions, allowing the trade and industry minister, Stephen Byers, to moot the possibility of a total break with them, and most recently at the 2000 party conference refusing to back down to union demands that state pensions be linked to average earnings. Now, to the surprise and consternation of many union-affiliated Labour MPs, there is an open door policy for the NUF - the only union thought even by its members to represent big business rather than the small, independent farmer. Farmer Andrew Tompkins, who has defected from the NFU to the much smaller National Sheep Association, said: \"The NFU has been irritating the hell out of me. They put forward the views of the 20% of big farmers who get 80% of the subsidies, not family farms under 200 acres which form the majority. \"They are 10 to 20 years behind the times, clinging on to the past subsidy regime and obstructing change.\" For many rank and file party members, relied upon to knock on doors and deliver leaflets in the coming general election campaign, this was one nostalgia trip they hoped had been consigned to the telly archives.

Music fans have shunned shops to download their favourite tunes from no-fee sites such as Napster and MP3.com, cutting last year's global record sales by 1.2% to \u00a325.8bn. The figures from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry showed the US market was hit the hardest, with sales of singles falling 46% in a country which accounts for 38% of global record purchases. Further pressure has been added by the downturn in the US economy, with consumers cutting back on luxuries such as CDs. \"The downturn in the US brought down the overall sales figures. We also saw the first evidence of the impact of free online music,\" said the IFPI. However, the IFPI figures show the sixth successive year of decline in record sales, as mobile phones and video games compete with CDs for consumers' disposable income. Napster has paradoxically thrown a lifeline to the record industry by offering it a new and innovative way to boost flagging sales. But this did not stop the major record companies from suing Napster into submission for breaching copyright laws and then establishing their own online operations. A new battle will now be fought to establish a standardised service, with Vivendi Universal and Sony forming Duet and EMI, Bertelsmann and AOL Time Warner backing MusicNet. But analysts said the new sites may not be enough to solve the fundamental problems of a shrinking market. \"The industry has to find a way of turning it around. There will be interest in the new services, but we have no idea what the music industry will charge. We need to know what will be offered, so it is way too early to say,\" said Helen Snell, analyst at ABN Amro. Consumers will also have to fight their way through a cluttered online music environment, with MTV and Microsoft also offering alternative downloading services. Internet specialists Jupiter Media Matrix predicts that US online music spending could reach \u00a31.02bn this year, increasing to \u00a33.75bn by 2005.

      "body": "<p>A new technology that could spark a reversal of fortunes for Wap services is just a month away from the high street. </p> <p>After more than a year of hype, the GPRS 'always on' mobile internet technology will finally go on sale to consumers on May 18. </p> <p>Previously, it was only available to the business community. </p> <p>BT Cellnet will be the first mobile operator to offer consumer GPRS, effectively an internet-oriented upgrade to the GSM networks that currently power our phones. </p> <p>GPRS, on the other hand, was designed for data exchange such as internet connections. </p> <p>Prices for GPRS network phones will start at \u00a3199, although it is expected that, like Wap phones, they will start high and then come down in price as networks subsidise the handsets. </p> <p>GPRS will kick off with two consumer tariffs: a basic \u00a33.99 per month pay-as-you-go service that will allow users to download data at 2p per kilobyte, equivalent to two Wap pages or a 100-word email. </p> <p>A basic bundle \u00a37.99 per month gives users 1Mb of downloads every month, but any additional data downloaded will be charged at \u00a33.99 per megabyte. </p> <p>These packages are in addition to the regular monthly voice tariff subscription and the cost of voice calls.</p> <p>The 'always on' capability of GPRS will put an end to the slow dialling-up to access Wap services and email and tediously slow browsing. </p> <p>One added benefit will be that customers will also be able to answer voice calls while in the middle of emailing or using Wap services. </p> <p>Later in the year, customers will be able to access traditional web pages via their GPRS phones and operators are working on mobile internet browsers that can handle graphics to give more of an normal internet-like experience. </p> <p>GPRS is seen as an interim replacement for GSM, which was only designed as a digital voice network, until 3G phones hit the market in around two years. </p> <p>The 3G licence frenzy has left mobile operators with massive debts they won't be able to pay back for many years. </p> <p>As a result, GPRS - or 2.5G as it's termed - is a way of getting consumers to upgrade phones and spend more money on services and networks to help out cash-strapped operators.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A new technology that could spark a reversal of fortunes for Wap services is just a month away from the high street. After more than a year of hype, the GPRS 'always on' mobile internet technology will finally go on sale to consumers on May 18. Previously, it was only available to the business community. BT Cellnet will be the first mobile operator to offer consumer GPRS, effectively an internet-oriented upgrade to the GSM networks that currently power our phones. GPRS, on the other hand, was designed for data exchange such as internet connections. Prices for GPRS network phones will start at \u00a3199, although it is expected that, like Wap phones, they will start high and then come down in price as networks subsidise the handsets. GPRS will kick off with two consumer tariffs: a basic \u00a33.99 per month pay-as-you-go service that will allow users to download data at 2p per kilobyte, equivalent to two Wap pages or a 100-word email. A basic bundle \u00a37.99 per month gives users 1Mb of downloads every month, but any additional data downloaded will be charged at \u00a33.99 per megabyte. These packages are in addition to the regular monthly voice tariff subscription and the cost of voice calls. The 'always on' capability of GPRS will put an end to the slow dialling-up to access Wap services and email and tediously slow browsing. One added benefit will be that customers will also be able to answer voice calls while in the middle of emailing or using Wap services. Later in the year, customers will be able to access traditional web pages via their GPRS phones and operators are working on mobile internet browsers that can handle graphics to give more of an normal internet-like experience. GPRS is seen as an interim replacement for GSM, which was only designed as a digital voice network, until 3G phones hit the market in around two years. The 3G licence frenzy has left mobile operators with massive debts they won't be able to pay back for many years. As a result, GPRS - or 2.5G as it's termed - is a way of getting consumers to upgrade phones and spend more money on services and networks to help out cash-strapped operators.",

The programme had 9.3m viewers and a 39% share of the available audience overall, according to unofficial overnights. It peaked at 10.5m between 9.15pm and 9.30pm as Man Utd chased the goals that would have kept them in the competition in the closing stage of the game.

Elsewhere last night, BBC1's Ground Force Goes East, featuring Alan Titchmarsh and the garden makeover gang in India, failed to beat ITV's football between 9.10pm and 10pm. The Ground Force special had 6.3m viewers and a 26% audience share.

      "body": "<p>The bloke who used to be head of IT at my old office, Pete, had a very clear idea of why he spent so much of his time trying to undo the crashes that I, or other \"laydeez\" had caused by trying to log on. \"They just ain't compatible, girls and computers,\" he used to whine, as he thundered across my keyboard for the fifth time in a week. \"Women just don't have the right sort of brains.\" </p> <p>The latest research studies in the US, however, show that there is now \"gender parity\" in internet use and at first glance, these statistics suggest that, far from being web illiterate, women are (surprise, surprise) just as competent as men. </p> <p>At a recent conference organised by Marketing Week, entitled Women on the Web - reaching beyond gender stereotypes online - Philip Bird from Microsoft's MSN, gave these new statistics further relevance. </p> <p>\"What is happening with the net in the US today,\" he stated unequivocally, \"will happen here 14 months later. In the UK at present there is still a male bias - but I expect it to be a 50:50 ratio very soon.\" (Cue a mass pinging of braces across adland) </p> <p>Such conviction (or is it merely optimism?) was echoed by other speakers at the event - to the glee of the gathered managing directors and brand managers. According to Hilary Groves of iVillage UK, \"Women are one of the fastest growing internet segments\". </p> <p>Her arrival in Britain is testament to her company's confidence. Her month-old website, a translation of a hugely successful US site, has stormed into the British market. </p> <p>A closer study of American statistics reveals that 60%of American women go online everyday. This research, carried out by the Pew Foundation, a charitable trust looking at the sociological impact of the net, found that US women favoured sites where they can shop, chat, download music or get health or career advice. They also discovered that over half of the group was logging on from home. Could this be the key to the explosion in female web use? Because, in the US, high-speed access is very often unmetered and usually free. Can we really expect the US experience to be replicated in Britain any time soon when, unlike Americans, most of us still have to pay BT for our home internet access? </p> <p>What we certainly can expect is that a large number of multinationals will take the US experience as gospel and forge into the British market, hoping to tap into the incredibly lucrative market segment that is the female consumer. </p> <p>Current British figures show that 36.6% of the 10m people online are women. They are ordering their groceries, making Tesco the biggest success story in e-commerce history; they are checking out their healthcare facilities through sites such as Wellbeing, an alliance between Boots and Granada; they are buying exclusive fashion through sites like Net-a-porter; they can even check up on the latest celebrity gossip. </p> <p>Jane Procter of Peoplenews.com has established that the majority of her users are women who are logging on from their offices. </p> <p>\"It is evident by the surge of user numbers at certain times of day that most are in an office. There is a huge push when people arrive at work and pick up their emails -then at lunchtime when they want something to read while they eat their sandwiches, and then again just before they leave. Our figures were 250,000 last month which is 30,000 higher than was projected - and we believe 60% are women.' </p> <p>While the figures concerning women at work are very promising, by comparison, only a small minority are logging on from home. </p> <p>Chad Wollen from consumer behaviour consultants, the Henley Centre, agrees that women in the home, most often mothers, are yet to be won over. \"Everything about the internet is unbelievably fast,\" he says, \"except the take-up by mums - which is unbelievably slow.\" </p> <p>But why is this fact so unbelievable, given that many mother's experiences of the web are so often bad. </p> <p>Take Jill. Jill is a freelance health journalist who should be swanning round the web picking up the most up-to-the-minute research. But what happens. </p> <p>\"I spend the half hour I have, before picking up my kids from school, hunting down Dr So-and-so from some university or other who appears to have done a study which is right up my street. And then I discover that the site hasn't been updated for three years and that Dr So-and-so moved on months ago. I can't afford to rely on information that can't be verified. I tend only to believe some thing now if it is between the covers of a book.\" </p> <p>And then take Rebecca. Now admittedly she still hasn't managed to get her head around email - but taking my suggestion to order a book on line, Rebecca spent two-and-a-half hours trying to track it down while her two-year-old twins had a fight on the living room floor. Eventually she gave up and found it at her local bookshop, which took her 20 minutes door to door and got the children out of the house. </p> <p> And finally, Liz, who is sick of her weekly shop in Tesco but is internet phobic. \"You have to shop online,\" I insisted. \"It's so simple - especially after you have done it once.\" </p> <p>Liz stumbled at the first hurdle. She tried to order baked beans and was then offered too many choices of size, multipack, brand, etc that she gave up. Now she's even more phobic. </p> <p>These women aren't stupid. Neither are they technologically incompetent. The Henley Centre has made significant findings in their research into this area. </p> <p>\"There are currently 4m mums online which is up 20% in the last six months,\" says Wollen. \"But only half of them use it every week. This betrays a complete lack of engagement. The internet has not become important to their everyday lives.\" </p> <p>There are many theories on why this is the case; that the PC is not accessible enough, hidden away as it often is, in a room at the back of the house; that the mum doesn't feel \"techie\" enough, particularly in comparison to her husband and offspring; that women don't trust the internet, particularly in terms of credit card security, junk email and viruses. But the most significant finding concerns time management. </p> <p>\"Women are not adventurous,\" continues Wollen. \"They are task driven which means they get impatient. Working mothers, in particular, are so tired and exhausted by looking after their jobs, their kids and their homes that the internet becomes yet another responsibility which ends up being the straw that broke the camel's back.\" </p> <p>With, on average, 15 hours less free time per week than their male counterparts, women simply don't have the time to boot up, download or surf. How deliciously ironic that something as archaic as the unequal division of household chores should be standing in the way of women embracing future technology and therefore multinationals embracing women. </p> <p>Sam Phillips believes that lack of time has led men and women to differ on the fundamental point of the web - with men thinking of it as recreational and women seeing it as functional. </p> <p>\"From the figures I've seen - it seems true that some women don't relax with their PCs. If they don't quickly and easily find what they want, they won't surf the net like a man would - they just find it offline.\" </p> <p>Women in offices, on the other hand, are becoming more and more web literate, treating it as yet another part of their media diet. Is this simply because they can do it all on the company's time at the company's expense? </p> <p>One area of the net which women at home have embraced wholeheartedly, however, is email. But the key here is that email fits into a woman's time-saving strategies, because it's even more convenient than a phone. How ideal can a form of communication be when it allows you to send and receive messages quickly, effectively and whenever you choose? </p> <p>The speakers at the Marketing Week conference predict that in the future, British mothers at home, like their American counterparts, will be treating the web as a new form of community. Not only will they be able to compare notes with other mothers, on how to get a baby to sleep or give up chocolate, they will also buy underwear, win holidays and get advice on health, beauty and fashion, all from the comfort of their own homes. </p> <p>But in the meantime, if large multinationals are going to reach this largely untapped market they are going to have to get to grips with how women behave in their homes and the time- saving strategies that they have developed there. Most often they will be doing at least two things at once - whether it is listening to the news while cooking a meal, interacting with the children while paying the bills, chatting to a friend while doing the ironing. Even a visit to the supermarket is a way of entertaining children, certainly more so than watching mum sit in front of a PC for half an hour and then fail to get any Tweenies yoghurts. </p> <p>The trouble with web access at the moment is that it demands 100 % attention - and many women can't afford to give that. \"Technology needs to be better suited to mums,\" Chad Wollen sums up. \"It needs to be as accessible as a PC loaded into a fridge door, always on, (so it doesn't need booting up) and non threatening in style and content.\" </p> <p>Clich\u00e9d as it sounds, it is only when the internet is full-time, online, on the fridge door that it really will become useful. Until that time the internet is simply not smart enough to match up to women's expectations. So there, Pete.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Down in the Maasai Mara, two skinny men are conferring over a goatskin, a pile of stones and liberal gobbets of spit. Kasaine ole Musanga, the shorter by a foot, is an oloiboni - a Maasai medicine man. Cameron Kirk, a heroin addict from Devon, is his patient. </p> <p>Musanga chuckles as he turns the prophetic stones with his forefinger. There are 400 of them: yellow, blue and black, the size of broad beans, all polished by the swirl of the Mara river. But it is not clear whether it is the stones that have pleased him, or something the younger of his two wives has said. She is pointing at the middle-aged white couple, Cameron's parents, John and Sue. They are staring fixedly at Musanga, though their hands are in constant motion; wiping away sweat, flicking at flies. </p> <p>Musanga is sitting in the shade of his manyatta, a squat one-room house of woven branches stuccoed with cow dung. His guests are crouching in the manure that is everywhere, under a fierce, midmorning sun. </p> <p>Knowledge of natural medicines runs deep in Maasai culture. Fathers teach sons how to treat their cattle and themselves with the barks and leaves of Kenya's southern plains. The oloiboni, separate from but not inferior to the clan chief, is a sort of consultant to this tribe of general practitioners. </p> <p>Before battle or a lion hunt, Maasai warriors go to the oloiboni for a stimulant - for medicine to make them brave. When their cows die suddenly - or when anything unexpected happens - the oloiboni finds an explanation in the stones. </p> <p>Musanga scoops up the pebbles into a gourd, spits into it, and mutters something. Then he pours them out again and makes his diagnosis. Cameron has forgotten the bad medicine; but he needs to get stronger. </p> <p>Cameron, 25, puffs nonchalantly on a cigarette, happy to believe him. Musanga's combination of mysticism and herbalism has achieved what years of methadone, rehab and psychiatric treatment could not. Cameron has been clean for three months; ever since his father, John, a retired RAF sergeant, bundled him off to the Mara. The needle marks peppering his forearms and feet have healed and they show pink through his tan. He no longer believes he will die a junkie. </p> <p>Two years ago, the Kirks flew Cameron out to Nairobi, where Sue was working with the Foreign Office, to straighten him out. It was a disastrous move - Cameron was soon injecting up to a gramme a day of heroin, purer than he had dreamed possible in England. Nairobi's rehabs said he was a hopeless case and the police had started using his nickname, \"kiketi [heroin] man\", when they stopped him in the street. </p> <p>It could not have been long before Cameron was charged and given a mandatory seven to 10-year sentence for heroin possession. Even the healthiest foreigner finds it difficult to survive Kenya's violent, typhus jails. And Cameron, who is 6ft 5in, weighed less than nine stone. </p> <p>Reasoning that prison in England - to which Cameron was no stranger, let alone foreign - was a healthier option, John decided to send him back. Meanwhile, he kept Cameron in heroin to keep him from crime. </p> <p>\"They were the worst weeks of my life,\" he says. \"I was watching my son killing himself and I was assisting him. If a dog was in that condition, you'd put it down.\" </p> <p>But even as John was driving to pick up Cameron's ticket, he was hailed by two Maasai friends. \"I told them what I was doing - they knew all about Cam,\" he says. \"But they said, 'Don't bother. We'll take him.'\" </p> <p>\"I wasn't thinking about an oloiboni. The idea was just to take him where escape would be impossible, let him live with the Maasai, and reinvent himself as a man - because they wouldn't put up with any shit from him.\" </p> <p>High as a kite, Cameron was easily deceived. John drove him down to Narok, the last dusty town before the great plains. There he left him with the Maasai pair, and with seven vials of pethadin to see him through the worst of withdrawal. When Cameron realised what was happening, he reached into his sock for a wrap of heroin and a syringe. </p> <p>Unfortunately, John's friends were not the noble warriors he had thought them to be. They dumped Cameron in a budget safari camp and went off to drink the money for his upkeep. For Rosemary Ngigi, who helps run the safari camp, his cold turkey was something else. \"He couldn't walk, he couldn't talk, he couldn't eat, he couldn't sleep. Oh, he looked horrible!\" she says. </p> <p>\"At first we were scared because we thought he had Aids. Then we saw he was out of his mind. He'd forget his cigarette until you could smell it burning his fingers. We thought he was about to die - that's what he was saying too.\" </p> <p>In his six years as a heroin addict, Cameron had never experienced withdrawal for more than a day. In rehab, he had been given powerful opiates and sedatives, methadone, largactol, rohypnol, pethadin and mogadon, to mask the symptoms. Otherwise, the closest he had come was when accidentally locked into his second floor King's Cross flat, terrified by the rising nausea, he jumped out of the window, breaking his pelvis. </p> <p>But for four days, and despite the pethadin he was jabbing frantically into his backside, Cameron experienced a full heroin withdrawal. </p> <p>\"I woke up in a tent, sweating, feeling very sick,\" he says, apologising for his jumbled thoughts: he is not used to remembering things, he says. \"By evening, the goose-bumps had come up. And the next three days were just horrible. I was retching all the time, and shivering, sweating, lying there with this horrible smell inside my nose, like there was shit up my nostrils.\" </p> <p>Musanga gave Cameron a basin of water, sprinkled with herbs, to wash with and powdered herbs to lick off his hand. \"Within 15 minutes I felt totally different,\" says Cameron. \"I still couldn't sleep, but I was relaxed. The sweats had halved, I'd stopped retching and after an hour I realised I was starving. I got up and ate till I thought I'd explode.\" </p> <p>For the Maasai, the power of the oloiboni is beyond question. \"I'm not surprised Musanga helped Cameron because I have seen it many times,\" says Salash Lealo, a local warrior. \"The oloiboni can tell when the dry season is coming and when the rains are coming. I have seen him cure people who were so crazy we had to tie them up to stop them running off into the wild.\" </p> <p>Cameron awoke from the worst of his cold turkey without any such faith: \"But I thought, 'I've come here, and this bloke, whether he's legitimate or not legitimate, has washed me with something and given me something, and I feel better. Let's see what he can do.'\" </p> <p>Besides which, Cameron had no choice. There are no heroin pushers among the Maasai. And the lions prowling around the camp ruled out a hitch-hike back to Nairobi. </p> <p>Musanga has been treating Cameron almost every day since. For a fortnight, Cameron moved into the smoky manyatta to live under the oloiboni's eye. Twice, Musanga took his patient into the bush, slaughtered a lamb, and forced quarts of soup mixed thickly with herbs into him. </p> <p>But generally, the treatment remains the same: a shamanistic diagnosis followed by a draught of herbal medicine. The Kirks say it has given them back their son. \"When he used to come out of rehab, he looked wild, still full of drugs; now he looks like the boy I had.\" </p> <p>Watching Cameron charming his way around the camp, chatting up backpackers, trying his Maasai out on the cooks, it is hard to believe that a few weeks ago a coherent sentence was beyond him. Watching his turn of speed running the hyena gauntlet between two campsites, it is hard to remember that, because of overdoses, over the past two years his heart has stopped a dozen times. </p> <p>But Musanga is not surprised at all. Whittling away at his moustache with his new Swiss army knife, a present from the Kirks, he says simply, \"Cameron came here with white man's medicine. It didn't work, so I helped him.\" </p> <p>Musanga says he could do the same for other addicts - but they would not be Maasai. \"Young Maasai don't do these things,\" he says. \"How could they? They have to respect their parents; they could not fight with them as Cameron does.\" </p> <p>And what are the herbs Musanga prescribes? What does he see in the stones? \"These things are secret because you do not need to know,\" he says, with a thoroughly mischievous grin. </p> <p>John Kirk, an embittered man who has watched his finances shrink and his marriage suffer under the strain of his son's addiction, has transferred all his disappointments into something close to adoration for the Maasai. \"The oloiboni has done for Cameron what western medicine could not, the Maasai have what the west has not,\" he says. \"If I had the choice again of sending my boy to an English public school or to the Maasai, I'd send him straight here.\" </p> <p>Cameron has a more balanced view. Looking out over the endless horizons of the Mara plain, he says his environment must have played a part: it is hard to make sense of mainlining in earshot of a lion's roar. </p> <p>But that would not be enough for long, says Cameron. \"If I'd wanted to, I could have stolen a car and got back to Nairobi. I don't know what the stones are about, but I know he's not pulling a fast one - rehab just doped me; but Musanga has changed the way I think. \" </p> <p>Understandably, Cameron is reluctant to leave the Mara for the temptation of Nairobi's bars. But his three weekends back in town so far have given cause for hope. </p> <p>\"It took them a while, but the taxi drivers recognised me,\" he says. \"They were saying, 'Hey, kiketi man, come with us, we'll get you high.' </p> <p>\"I thought about it - I had money in my pocket. But I told them: 'No, that's not me any more.' To be honest, I just wasn't fucking interested.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Wear an MP3</strong><br> Panasonic's pair of wearable MP3 players reach UK stores this week, more than a year after they were first paraded at the CES exhibition in January 2000. The two E-Wear models, the SV-SD75 and SV-SD05 are among the first audio players to go on sale in the UK that feature both AAC (advanced audio coding) and MP3 compatibility. Devel oped by Dolby and Sony the AAC codec offers superior sound quality and more efficient compression than MP3. Panasonic says that if CDs are converted using its AAC encoding software, the player's 64MB SD (Secure Digital) card can store around two hour's worth of \"better-than MP3-quality\" sounds. </p> <p>One of the smallest players on sale, the \u00a3300 SV-SD75 is designed to be worn either on the wrist or hung around the neck. It is accompanied by a USB reader/writer and wrist and neck straps. </p> <p>Panasonic is also offering the \u00a3300 SV SD05 - an MP3/AAC player built into a pair of foldable headphones. It, too, comes with a 64MB SD card. Neither player is Mac compatible. </p> <p><strong> E-movie</strong><br> Sony has announced the imminent arrival of a trio of high-end digital camcorders. </p> <p>Top of the range is the \u00a31,500 DCR-TRV30E, the first Sony camcorder to sport a new facility called E-Movie. This enables the user to store moving images as MPEG files on the camcorder's accompanying 4MB Memory Stick card. The mini-movie can then be transferred to a PC and sent as an email. </p> <p>The DCR-TRV30E's digital video image quality is superior to previous Sony camcorders. It boasts a 1.5 mega pixel CCD that delivers a moving horizontal image resolution of 530 lines and still pictures of 1,360 x 1,020 pixels. The camcorder also sports a 3.5inch LCD monitor, a 120x digital zoom, Super Steady Shot anti-shake facilities, and Super Night Shot, which enables the user to shoot images in complete darkness. Connection to a PC is via a supplied I-Link connector, which, for the first time on a Sony camcorder, offers both DV in and out. Sony says that the user can shoot for up to eight hours before they need to recharge the camcorder's battery. </p> <p>The \u00a31,000 DCR-TRV17E is similar to the DCR-TRV30E, but has a lower resolution CCD and has no DV in facility. A budget version, the \u00a3800 DCR-TRV15E, also shares many of its siblings' features, but has a smaller 2.5inch LCD monitor and has no MPEG movie or digital still capture facilities. </p> <p><strong> Toshiba joins in</strong><br> Toshiba is also championing the AAC music format by delivering a joint AAC/MP3 player to stores this week. The tiny silver-cased \u00a3230 MEA210 features 32MB of embedded memory, enough for more than an hour of quality AAC music. It also sports a slot for a SD card which can increase the storage up to 96MB. </p> <p>The player is accompanied by a Toshiba Audio Manager CD-rom, which includes software that converts music files (WAV/CD or MP3) to the AAC format. The unit, powered by AAA batteries, comes with stereo headphones, a USB interface and a selection of tone controls. </p>",

The two E-Wear models, the SV-SD75 and SV-SD05 are among the first audio players to go on sale in the UK that feature both AAC (advanced audio coding) and MP3 compatibility. Devel oped by Dolby and Sony the AAC codec offers superior sound quality and more efficient compression than MP3. Panasonic says that if CDs are converted using its AAC encoding software, the player's 64MB SD (Secure Digital) card can store around two hour's worth of \"better-than MP3-quality\" sounds. One of the smallest players on sale, the \u00a3300 SV-SD75 is designed to be worn either on the wrist or hung around the neck. It is accompanied by a USB reader/writer and wrist and neck straps. Panasonic is also offering the \u00a3300 SV SD05 - an MP3/AAC player built into a pair of foldable headphones. It, too, comes with a 64MB SD card. Neither player is Mac compatible. E-movie Sony has announced the imminent arrival of a trio of high-end digital camcorders. Top of the range is the \u00a31,500 DCR-TRV30E, the first Sony camcorder to sport a new facility called E-Movie. This enables the user to store moving images as MPEG files on the camcorder's accompanying 4MB Memory Stick card. The mini-movie can then be transferred to a PC and sent as an email. The DCR-TRV30E's digital video image quality is superior to previous Sony camcorders. It boasts a 1.5 mega pixel CCD that delivers a moving horizontal image resolution of 530 lines and still pictures of 1,360 x 1,020 pixels. The camcorder also sports a 3.5inch LCD monitor, a 120x digital zoom, Super Steady Shot anti-shake facilities, and Super Night Shot, which enables the user to shoot images in complete darkness. Connection to a PC is via a supplied I-Link connector, which, for the first time on a Sony camcorder, offers both DV in and out. Sony says that the user can shoot for up to eight hours before they need to recharge the camcorder's battery. The \u00a31,000 DCR-TRV17E is similar to the DCR-TRV30E, but has a lower resolution CCD and has no DV in facility. A budget version, the \u00a3800 DCR-TRV15E, also shares many of its siblings' features, but has a smaller 2.5inch LCD monitor and has no MPEG movie or digital still capture facilities. Toshiba joins in Toshiba is also championing the AAC music format by delivering a joint AAC/MP3 player to stores this week. The tiny silver-cased \u00a3230 MEA210 features 32MB of embedded memory, enough for more than an hour of quality AAC music. It also sports a slot for a SD card which can increase the storage up to 96MB. The player is accompanied by a Toshiba Audio Manager CD-rom, which includes software that converts music files (WAV/CD or MP3) to the AAC format. The unit, powered by AAA batteries, comes with stereo headphones, a USB interface and a selection of tone controls.",

Many of the people here regard them as their friends.\"</p> <p>She said the concept of the farm for the disabled had started during the second world war. It now operates with 10 households, with many of the disabled members referred either by their families or social services.</p> <p>Fellow farm worker Jon Meligan said: \"The animals are an integral part of the farm.

      "body": "<p>Sport in the movies has always provided an ideal metaphor for American life, whether as an exemplification of America as the land of opportunity or of the philosophy that in America you must either win or die. The film director Michael Ritchie, who has died of prostate cancer aged 62, often used sport as a parable against the winning ethic. His films mostly explore the morality of competition in a satirical manner. In time, Ritchie said that he had learnt, in his own erratic career, to \"treat success and failure as the twin impostors they are\".</p> <p>There was nothing in Ritchie's background to suggest an interest in either sport or films. His father was a professor of experimental psychology at the University of California, and his mother an art and music librarian. At Harvard, Ritchie gained a degree in history and literature, although he was interested in drama. There is a line in Semi-Tough (1977) that Ritchie relished, where a publisher trying to get a professional footballer to write a book about the sport from the inside says, \"Intellectuals are the jocks of the mind.\"</p> <p>In his senior year in 1960, Ritchie gained attention by directing the original production of Harvard-graduate Arthur Kopit's black comedy about all-American \"momism\" - Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You In The Closet And I'm Feelin' So Sad. After some years directing episodes of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. and Dr Kildare, Robert Redford gave him his first crack at making a feature film. The star had been so impressed by one of Ritchie's TV films that he asked him to direct Downhill Racer (1969). The film, which claimed to be \"the first American movie to tackle the subject of ski-racing\", was directed in a semi-documentary style, mixing 16mm with 35mm, and giving a rare insight into the sport. There was no studio filming, no back projection. A professional skier filmed most of the shots of flying skis at speeds of 60-80 mph while holding a 151lb camera. Redford, just breaking into super-stardom, gives one of his cool, self-centred, cynical performances, and the direction has some of the same characteristics.</p> <p>Ritchie continued his theme of competition in The Candidate (1972) and Smile (1976), satires on Middle America. The first dug beneath the surface irony and realistic reconstruction of an election campaign, with Redford well cast as the bland lawyer who finds himself manipulated when he stands as a senator.

      "bodyText": "Sport in the movies has always provided an ideal metaphor for American life, whether as an exemplification of America as the land of opportunity or of the philosophy that in America you must either win or die. The film director Michael Ritchie, who has died of prostate cancer aged 62, often used sport as a parable against the winning ethic. His films mostly explore the morality of competition in a satirical manner. In time, Ritchie said that he had learnt, in his own erratic career, to \"treat success and failure as the twin impostors they are\". There was nothing in Ritchie's background to suggest an interest in either sport or films. His father was a professor of experimental psychology at the University of California, and his mother an art and music librarian. At Harvard, Ritchie gained a degree in history and literature, although he was interested in drama. There is a line in Semi-Tough (1977) that Ritchie relished, where a publisher trying to get a professional footballer to write a book about the sport from the inside says, \"Intellectuals are the jocks of the mind.\" In his senior year in 1960, Ritchie gained attention by directing the original production of Harvard-graduate Arthur Kopit's black comedy about all-American \"momism\" - Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You In The Closet And I'm Feelin' So Sad. After some years directing episodes of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. and Dr Kildare, Robert Redford gave him his first crack at making a feature film. The star had been so impressed by one of Ritchie's TV films that he asked him to direct Downhill Racer (1969). The film, which claimed to be \"the first American movie to tackle the subject of ski-racing\", was directed in a semi-documentary style, mixing 16mm with 35mm, and giving a rare insight into the sport. There was no studio filming, no back projection. A professional skier filmed most of the shots of flying skis at speeds of 60-80 mph while holding a 151lb camera. Redford, just breaking into super-stardom, gives one of his cool, self-centred, cynical performances, and the direction has some of the same characteristics. Ritchie continued his theme of competition in The Candidate (1972) and Smile (1976), satires on Middle America. The first dug beneath the surface irony and realistic reconstruction of an election campaign, with Redford well cast as the bland lawyer who finds himself manipulated when he stands as a senator. Smile, virtually a series of sketches following the fortunes of the 32 entrants in the Young American Miss competition, was often amusing, despite the superior position adopted by the director towards the beauty contest. A much lighter touch was evident in The Bad News Bears (1976), a delightfully wry comedy containing the un-American message that winning isn't everything. The Little League baseball team is the most individualisedbunch of kids since Our Gang, cute in the sense of smart, while beer-swilling Walter Matthau, as their misanthropic coach, never noticeably plays for laughs. Semi-Tough, starring Burt Reynolds and Kris Kristofferson as footballers living in a platonic threesome with Jill Clayburgh until sex rears its head, had a witty, free-wheeling quality for most of the way with football only one target of the film's sharp jibes. Underneath Reynolds's hairy-chested macho exterior is a warm human being who would like to write a book and marry the girl he loves. The football games are mostly in slow motion, as if to demonstrate the unimportance of the result. Another kind of competition was satirised by Ritchie in An Almost Perfect Affair (1979), a romantic comedy with Keith Carradine and Monica Vitti as producer and star at the Cannes Film Festival. Its dismal box-office takings drove Ritchie into making less interesting commercial products. These included The Island (1980), an unintentionally risible but intentionally gruesome modern pirate tale; The Survivors (1983), a surprisingly unfunny black comedy given that its stars were Matthau and Robin Williams; and The Golden Child (1986), mystical Oriental guff. Ritchie found more satisfaction working on cable television, which he considered offered \"opportunities to do the kind of interesting films that were done in the 1970s, films that are not quite mainstream but are very accessible. Directors used to think they were slumming when they worked on television. Not any more.\" One of Ritchie's better TV movies was The Positively True Adventures Of The Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom (1993), with Holly Hunter in the title role of a woman accused of plotting to kill the mother of her daughter's cheerleading rival. On the big screen, Ritchie continued to make comedies, although they lacked satirical edge. There was Fletch (1985) and Fletch Lives (1989), involving Chevy Chase in many disguises and silly situations, and The Couch Trip (1987), with over-the-top performances from Dan Aykroyd and Walter Matthau. Diggstown aka Midnight Sting (1992) was a welcome return to the sport picture, this time a boxing yarn, in which Ritchie's snappy direction managed to keep the rather complicated story, in which there are as many double crosses as right crosses, as lucid as possible. One of his last projects was a video documentary about Albert Einstein. Michael Ritchie is survived by his wife, a son and four daughters.

We could protest that we're no worse than everyone else.

But there is another, less predictable response: we can listen. We can pause for a second and see ourselves the way our neighbours see us. We may be in for an unpleasant surprise.</p> <p>So we might listen to the council's claim that we tend to think of economic migrants as parasites and \"criminals trying to sneak into our country\". We might consider, and not dismiss, the EU's racism and xenophobia monitoring unit in Vienna, which last month ranked Britain, of all the 15 member states, as the most hostile to political refugees.</p> <p>We might decide that, judging by our present form, the Europeans have got us about right. Only this month the outgoing Tory MPs John Townend and Christopher Gill offered up a double-act of Powellite xenophobia and stale bigotry. No sooner had Townend sung the praises of old Enoch, lamenting that \"Commonwealth immigration\" had undermined our \"homogenous Anglo-Saxon society,\" than Gill was backing him up. Rising numbers of asylum seekers were causing a \"rats in a bucket syndrome\", diluting our national character. \"If you pour enough water on a double scotch,\" he said, \"it ceases to taste like whisky.\"</p> <p>Since neither of these men were denied the Conservative Whip in Parliament, we can fairly conclude that the Tory leader William Hague sees no great contradiction between their views and parliamentary service for his party. And why should he? Did not Hague authorise a leaflet for last year's local elections warning of \"bogus asylum seekers . . . flooding\" these shores? Did he not raise the alarm recently about Britain becoming a \"foreign land\"?</p> <p>So maybe the Euro-inspectors were not so wrong about us after all.

It is that, after years of suffering British Euroscepticism, Europe is finally getting its own back.</p> <p>Call it Britoscepticism. From the European heads of government furious with British agriculture for once again infecting the continent with disease, to a foreign press that has branded Britain Plague Island, our neighbours seem set to make Eurosceptic dreams come true. The British right wing always longed for Britain to break from the continent; now, apparently, the continent wants shot of us.</p> <p>It's not just the headlines announcing catastrophe and images of pyres and burning flesh; Britain's neighbours have connected the latest crisis, over foot and mouth, with a deeper malaise. We are, they say, the \"sick man of Europe,\" the \"septic isle\". For them foot and mouth is not an isolated, freakish episode but part of a continuum - with BSE the defining event. It is because of mad cow disease, which did have lethal implications for humans, that foreigners have assumed the worst about F&amp;M - even though the worst damage F&amp;M might inflict on a person would be a cold sore. It's no wonder that NBC News warns Americans of \"the killer disease now stalking Britain - and how we can stop it coming here\". When it comes to food safety, we are not trusted: we have previous convictions.</p> <p>But the problem is deeper still. Foreign observers are linking foot and mouth not only with our agricultural plight, but with the very way we function as a society. Italy's L'Espresso cited our stubborn rates of poverty, the Hatfield rail disaster and the Real IRA's ongoing bombing campaign, as well as the animal epidemics, as proof that Britain was a nation under a \"curse\". Doubtless they will now be adding the return of tuberculosis to their list.</p> <p>Thomas Keilinger of Germany's Die Welt writes of the parlous state of our public services, particularly the hospitals and railways. One dispatch announced that Britain is \"slowly disappearing in the mire of the real-existing chaos\".</p> <p>Keilinger has told his readers of our lack of patriotism, the vacuity of the Dome, the winter floods and our appalling weather.

Now we realise there is so much that is still creaky . . . the Thatcher revolution left whole swaths of society destitute, struggling to survive.\" He has said that, after the Russians, the British may be the longest-suffering populace in the world - prepared to put up with sub-standard services when others would have revolted against them decades ago.</p> <p>Of course, there is some journalistic hyperbole here, as there would be if the roles were reversed. But it's hard not to see a warning. For years we were like the old headline-writer who decided that, since the Channel was fog-bound, the continent was cut off. For years we assumed that Britain was the great catch, with Europe the pushy suitor desperate for our hand. The Eurosceptic case rested on a British arrogance that saw participation in the European Union as a kind of favour to those grasping, desperate continentals.</p> <p>Now we can see that the true situation may be the other way around. Having heard the British press and politicians pour scorn on them for generations, the Europeans are exacting their revenge. They are seeing Britain as a charity case that needs their help. When the time comes for Tony Blair to make good his promise to be \"at the heart of Europe,\" he may find that, far from welcoming him in as a young, energetic saviour, the neighbours might offer him pity and a cup of sweetened tea - but only after he's wiped his feet in a trough of disinfectant.</p>",

Lisa Clark, the former LWT head of comedy, has resurfaced at the BBC as an entertainment executive producer. The five main industry regulators to be merged to form Ofcom are struggling to reconcile their differences despite public protestations of unity. BBC News 24 has unveiled an ambitious plan to focus almost entirely on general election coverage in the run-up to polling day.

The film-maker optioned the rights to Deborah Moggach's middlebrow period novel two years ago and signed the writer up to adapt it for the screen. A few months ago, Spielberg decided to fire Moggach and bring on board <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Hall,+Lee\">Lee Hall</a>, the Oscar-nominated writer of Billy Elliot. This week he axed Hall in favour of Dangerous Liaison writer <a herf=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Hampton,+Christopher\">Christopher Hampton</a>. Hall's agent is baffled: \"We were very proud of the script and it's upsetting when a new writer is brought on board. Lee put a lot of work into it and we have no idea why it didn't go ahead.\"</p> <p>Having watched more films than is possibly healthy, veteran critic <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0090523\">Roger Ebert</a> is perhaps one of the best qualified people to select a season of movies that slipped by without enough people noticing. To this end, he has developed <a href=\"http://www.ebertfest.com/\">Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival</a>, which runs in his native Chicago from April 25-29. Deserving of more attention, reckons Ebert, are such films as Songs From the Second Floor, Such a Long Journey, Jesus's Son, The King of Masks, Girl on the Bridge and Woody Allen's oddball musical Everyone Says I Love You.</p> <p>The hunt for the wicked Lothario who <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/News_Story/Exclusive/0,,434677,00.html\">broke up Tom and Nicole's marriage</a> alighted on a new suspect this week as Scottish star <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?McGregor,+Ewan\">Ewan McGregor</a> was impelled to defend himself against rumours that he became over-close with Kidman on the set of their new movie, <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0203009\">Moulin Rouge</a>. With Russell Crowe and Penelope Cruz having already undergone the tabloid scrutiny, it was the turn of the Trainspotting star to protest his innocence. \"I didn't have an affair with Nicole Kidman,\" McGregor insisted to <a href=\"http://www.details.com/\">Details</a> magazine. \"It was nothing to do with me.\" The actor added that he had \"no idea\" that the pair's marriage was in trouble during the making of the movie.</p> <p>Australian <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0076759\">Star Wars</a> fans risk being slapped with stiff fines if they persist in listing their religion as \"Jedi\" on the nation's official census forms.

      "bodyText": "Steven Spielberg appears to be acting as a ruthless gardener on the production of the DreamWorks movie Tulip Fever, weeding out his British screenwriters at an alarming rate. The film-maker optioned the rights to Deborah Moggach's middlebrow period novel two years ago and signed the writer up to adapt it for the screen. A few months ago, Spielberg decided to fire Moggach and bring on board Lee Hall, the Oscar-nominated writer of Billy Elliot. This week he axed Hall in favour of Dangerous Liaison writer Christopher Hampton. Hall's agent is baffled: \"We were very proud of the script and it's upsetting when a new writer is brought on board. Lee put a lot of work into it and we have no idea why it didn't go ahead.\" Having watched more films than is possibly healthy, veteran critic Roger Ebert is perhaps one of the best qualified people to select a season of movies that slipped by without enough people noticing. To this end, he has developed Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival, which runs in his native Chicago from April 25-29. Deserving of more attention, reckons Ebert, are such films as Songs From the Second Floor, Such a Long Journey, Jesus's Son, The King of Masks, Girl on the Bridge and Woody Allen's oddball musical Everyone Says I Love You. The hunt for the wicked Lothario who broke up Tom and Nicole's marriage alighted on a new suspect this week as Scottish star Ewan McGregor was impelled to defend himself against rumours that he became over-close with Kidman on the set of their new movie, Moulin Rouge. With Russell Crowe and Penelope Cruz having already undergone the tabloid scrutiny, it was the turn of the Trainspotting star to protest his innocence. \"I didn't have an affair with Nicole Kidman,\" McGregor insisted to Details magazine. \"It was nothing to do with me.\" The actor added that he had \"no idea\" that the pair's marriage was in trouble during the making of the movie. Australian Star Wars fans risk being slapped with stiff fines if they persist in listing their religion as \"Jedi\" on the nation's official census forms. Officials have noticed a worrying number of such responses being posted in as a result of an international email campaign to force governments to recognise Jedi-ism (the mystical mumbo-jumbo espoused by Obi Wan Kenobi and the irksome Yoda) as an official denomination. But the Australian Board of Statistics is not amused. It threatens to slap each offending Star Wars fan with a $1000 fine.",

Examples: Gary Oldman, Billy Idol, Vyvyan from the Young Ones, Daphne from Frasier's inexplicably cockney brother. Anne Robinson's chances: Not bad at all. Darth Vader Everyone in America knows that Satan is British, which is why anyone evil must be played by someone with a suitably sinister English accent. All right, so the actor who did Vader's voice, James Earl Jones, is from Mississippi, but that is beside the point. He sounds plenty evil, and that sounds British. From vampires and invading aliens to Bond villains and the bad animals in Disney cartoons, British is always best. Qualifications: Evil incarnate, but easily vanquished in the end. Examples: Alan Rickman in Die Hard, The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, Joan Collins, Liz Hurley in Bedazzled, Christopher Lee.",

      "bodyText": "Celebrity Bodies, the controversial magazine that tells readers how to copy the diet and fitness regimes of celebrities like Geri Halliwell and Jennifer Aniston, proved so compelling to a nation of fitness freaks that it sold out within a day and a half in branches of WH Smith. The retailer refused to confirm the figures, but said sales had \"vastly exceeded expectations\". It is understood all 9,000 copies stocked by the high street retailer were gone within a day and a half. Sources at the company say this is \"almost unprecedented\". Alison Hall, the editor of Celebrity Bodies, was unavailable for comment, but there is speculation that the magazine will be published more frequently than once every quarter after the success of the first run. The magazine has been dogged by controversy since its launch, with positive body image advocates saying it added to women's insecurity over their weight. In its only issue to date, the magazine gave its readers a rundown of how to imitate the diet that took Aniston from a size 12 to a size six. Tessa Jowell, the women's minister, branded the magazine as \"grim reading\". The Celebrity Bodies editor, Alison Hall, defended the magazine, claiming it was full of \"nutritionally sound diets\". Ms Jowell and women's magazine editors last year chaired a \"body image summit\" at which the editors of women's magazines were invited to discuss pressures on young women to lose weight and the role of glossy magazines. The departing editor of the Marie Claire magazine, Liz Jones, lashed out at other magazine editors in a Mail on Sunday editorial. In the article, Ms Jones named and shamed other women's magazine editors who she said \"encourage eating disorders\". Among others, she named Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman, Elle editor Fiona McIntosh and Glamour editor Jo Elvin.

But Coca-Cola, Anheuser-Busch, Campbell Soup, US media firm Times Mirror and Wal-Mart dropped off the list altogether. The 100 Best Corporate Citizens for 2001, a list of the most profitable and socially responsible major public companies in the US has been compiled by Business Ethics Magazine. The list was compiled by examining 650 top public US companies and their stockholder performance and impact on local communities, minorities, employees, global stakeholders, customers and the environment. Thirty-one companies fell off the 2001 list but Apple Computer (number 32), McDonald's (78), Dow Jones (79), and Eastman Kodak (82) were all new entrants. P&amp;G moved up from number four last year to take the top slot. It scored highly in service to international stakeholders as did Avon Products (20), and Starbucks (24). P&amp;G's international grants and gifts, including earthquake relief in Turkey and community building projects in Japan stood it in good stead. But the company's use of animal ingredients and products, although it has banned testing on animals, continues to cause concern among activists. The company's products include Sunny Delight, Fairy Liquid, Pringles and Pampers. Hewlett-Packard came second, with its community development and education initiatives and an employee-friendly work environment that includes 52 weeks' maternity leave. Gillette (56) earned the highest score for its proactive approach to environmental restoration with an innovative programme to restore America's wetlands. IBM dropped from the top spot to number five largely as a result of its mishandling of changes to its pension plan, which cost some older employees as much as 50% of their pension. Not one single car manufacturer or petroleum company made it on to the list, proving that the social and environmental impact of some products are hard to overcome.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Liv Tyler, coltish, barefoot, says hello. I say hello back. And then we sit facing one another in a harshly lit room with no windows until she, rocking gently like a bear at a zoo, stares straight at me with a fierce, spotlight intensity. Panic spreads across her face. \"I'm totally freaked out,\" she says. \"This room is freaking me out.\" She suggests we fake anxiety attacks and run screaming from the premises. Instead, once the crisis has passed, we find ourselves discussing Jamie Oliver. \"The Naked Chef!\" She is a big fan of his recipes. It's surprising and strangely depressing that she even knows who he is. \"Of course I do. Hey, you know ... I'm with it.\" </p> <p>Maybe we should talk about her latest film, the purposefully frothy One Night at McCool's. It is, after all, the reason she's here, tipping back and forth in what does resemble a well-appointed dungeon. </p> <p>Revolving around the doomed fixation of three older men with her wide-eyed free spirit, McCool's may not unduly trouble next year's Oscar selectors, but it does provide its star with a showcase for talents more often submerged beneath her fame as the daughter of Steven Tyler, venerable frontman of rock rou\u00e9s Aerosmith. It also captures, in an accidental way, the nature of her own celebrity - specifically, her near-deification by a slew of male acolytes (in the film, they include Matt Dillon and Michael Douglas; in reality, they cluster on internet sites called, for example, \"Wow! Liv Tyler!\"). </p> <p>\"I know,\" she says. \"It's always me and a bunch of men.\" And she's OK with that? \"Yeah. I mean, I think it's weird the way there's chick flicks, and then there's every other movie. But I've taken the parts I have because I loved the film, not because ...\" She trails off. \"Maybe it says more about the film industry than about me.\" </p> <p>All the same, the central theme of McCool's - half-crazed male genuflection - is the one constant in a series of professional choices not so much diverse as seemingly made with a pile of scripts and a pin. In the seven years since her debut in the earnest drama Silent Fall, she has done - among others - a blockbuster (Armageddon), a Pushkin adaptation (Onegin), two Robert Altman movies (Cookie's Fortune, Dr T and the Women) and at least one project requiring her to sport pointed ears and speak Elvish (the forthcoming Lord of the Rings). Not for her the careful careerism of, say, Christina Ricci or Kate Hudson. She meets my eyes again, then lights a cigarette. </p> <p>\"I'm winging it,\" she says. \"I mean, I'm still not sure about myself, so I'm constantly trying new things.\" She looks like she's going to faint. Everything all right? \"Yeah ... no, it's just this room - the wallpaper's making me dizzy. Anyway, Armageddon. I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I was scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career - I just want it to be special when I make a movie.\" </p> <p>Having taken one drag on her cigarette, she stubs it out. When she says she's not sure of herself, does she mean professionally or personally? \"Both. Yeah. Both. I mean, is anybody sure of themselves? I know I'm not.\" </p> <p>The temptation, as ever, is to start putting two and two together. After all, Tyler is the product of an upbringing sufficiently fractured to have been lifted from soap opera. The daughter of one-time Playboy centrefold Bebe Buell - immortalised in Elvis Costello's Party Girl - she spent her childhood in Maine believing her father was singer-songwriter Todd Rundgren. Steven Tyler was simply another of her mother's friends - a playfully Bacchanalian presence who dropped by between narcotic fugues. She was 10 when the realisation dawned that she, Tyler, and the latter's daughter Mia were, in many respects, physically identical. Finally, Buell told her the truth. </p> <p>Rather than spiral into pre-teen crisis, Tyler immediately adopted her father's name and \"just adjusted. You get used to things when you're young.\" Her relationship with her father has been close ever since - in a detail hovering somewhere between touching and icky, they bonded while giving each other facials at \"slumber parties\". Is she bored with talking about her parents? \"No, not at all. I love them to death. It's just interviews are weird, because there's always going to be stuff I'm never going to talk about in public. Because it's really nobody's business ...\" </p> <p>She lies on the sofa, I sit opposite, notebook in hand. From above, we look like patient and shrink. Yet despite this room, and her early life, Tyler radiates nothing but sheer, beatific calm. While the boys on the net may have a different vocabulary, there is, in truth, a single word for Tyler: \"centred\". </p> <p>\"These things are all relative to your experience,\" she says. \"If everything is one way and then it all changes, then yeah, you're going to get freaked. But I always had this array of family members, so for me it really wasn't that strange.

      "bodyText": "Liv Tyler, coltish, barefoot, says hello. I say hello back. And then we sit facing one another in a harshly lit room with no windows until she, rocking gently like a bear at a zoo, stares straight at me with a fierce, spotlight intensity. Panic spreads across her face. \"I'm totally freaked out,\" she says. \"This room is freaking me out.\" She suggests we fake anxiety attacks and run screaming from the premises. Instead, once the crisis has passed, we find ourselves discussing Jamie Oliver. \"The Naked Chef!\" She is a big fan of his recipes. It's surprising and strangely depressing that she even knows who he is. \"Of course I do. Hey, you know ... I'm with it.\" Maybe we should talk about her latest film, the purposefully frothy One Night at McCool's. It is, after all, the reason she's here, tipping back and forth in what does resemble a well-appointed dungeon. Revolving around the doomed fixation of three older men with her wide-eyed free spirit, McCool's may not unduly trouble next year's Oscar selectors, but it does provide its star with a showcase for talents more often submerged beneath her fame as the daughter of Steven Tyler, venerable frontman of rock rou\u00e9s Aerosmith. It also captures, in an accidental way, the nature of her own celebrity - specifically, her near-deification by a slew of male acolytes (in the film, they include Matt Dillon and Michael Douglas; in reality, they cluster on internet sites called, for example, \"Wow! Liv Tyler!\"). \"I know,\" she says. \"It's always me and a bunch of men.\" And she's OK with that? \"Yeah. I mean, I think it's weird the way there's chick flicks, and then there's every other movie. But I've taken the parts I have because I loved the film, not because ...\" She trails off. \"Maybe it says more about the film industry than about me.\" All the same, the central theme of McCool's - half-crazed male genuflection - is the one constant in a series of professional choices not so much diverse as seemingly made with a pile of scripts and a pin. In the seven years since her debut in the earnest drama Silent Fall, she has done - among others - a blockbuster (Armageddon), a Pushkin adaptation (Onegin), two Robert Altman movies (Cookie's Fortune, Dr T and the Women) and at least one project requiring her to sport pointed ears and speak Elvish (the forthcoming Lord of the Rings). Not for her the careful careerism of, say, Christina Ricci or Kate Hudson. She meets my eyes again, then lights a cigarette. \"I'm winging it,\" she says. \"I mean, I'm still not sure about myself, so I'm constantly trying new things.\" She looks like she's going to faint. Everything all right? \"Yeah ... no, it's just this room - the wallpaper's making me dizzy. Anyway, Armageddon. I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I was scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career - I just want it to be special when I make a movie.\" Having taken one drag on her cigarette, she stubs it out. When she says she's not sure of herself, does she mean professionally or personally? \"Both. Yeah. Both. I mean, is anybody sure of themselves? I know I'm not.\" The temptation, as ever, is to start putting two and two together. After all, Tyler is the product of an upbringing sufficiently fractured to have been lifted from soap opera. The daughter of one-time Playboy centrefold Bebe Buell - immortalised in Elvis Costello's Party Girl - she spent her childhood in Maine believing her father was singer-songwriter Todd Rundgren. Steven Tyler was simply another of her mother's friends - a playfully Bacchanalian presence who dropped by between narcotic fugues. She was 10 when the realisation dawned that she, Tyler, and the latter's daughter Mia were, in many respects, physically identical. Finally, Buell told her the truth. Rather than spiral into pre-teen crisis, Tyler immediately adopted her father's name and \"just adjusted. You get used to things when you're young.\" Her relationship with her father has been close ever since - in a detail hovering somewhere between touching and icky, they bonded while giving each other facials at \"slumber parties\". Is she bored with talking about her parents? \"No, not at all. I love them to death. It's just interviews are weird, because there's always going to be stuff I'm never going to talk about in public. Because it's really nobody's business ...\" She lies on the sofa, I sit opposite, notebook in hand. From above, we look like patient and shrink. Yet despite this room, and her early life, Tyler radiates nothing but sheer, beatific calm. While the boys on the net may have a different vocabulary, there is, in truth, a single word for Tyler: \"centred\". \"These things are all relative to your experience,\" she says. \"If everything is one way and then it all changes, then yeah, you're going to get freaked. But I always had this array of family members, so for me it really wasn't that strange. I mean, my mother's this amazing, free-spirited woman, my dad's my dad, and my grandmother's an etiquette consultant. So that's what was natural to me, to be around all these different ways of life.\" Your grandmother's a what? \"An etiquette consultant. She owns this place called the Protocol School of Washington. She puts on seminars to teach people about table settings and how to conduct themselves. She's really big on tea.\" Maybe the reason people have such a preoccupation with her childhood is that, with its overtones of vintage rock debauchery, it's all so weirdly innocent? So 1970s? Her face falls. \"I'm so sad about Joey Ramone.\" She could, of course, simply be changing the subject - or maybe not. \"So sad.

      "body": "<p>Not a pyre, not a burial pit in sight. But there were plenty of sheep chomping the grass of north Wales yesterday as 13 tourism managers from Europe trundled through the Snowdonia national park on a bus named Georgina.</p> <p>\"I have only been to London before,\" said Katia Longevale, partner of Claude Perignon, quality manager of Belgium's biggest tourism group. \"The nature here is very rough and there are a lot of sheep. We made a little joke that the tourist people had put them there for us.\"</p> <p>The implication was that the sheep were stuffed; but then a fat ewe and her triplets moved. They were part of a total Welsh herd which used to be estimated at 10m, but no one is counting now.</p> <p>Later a cloud of smoke drifted over trees in the Conwy valley near Llanwryst. It looked ominous but could have been innocent.</p> <p>\"I haven't seen any dead sheep and I didn't expect to see any,\" said Rolf Forsdahl, director of the Norwegian tour company HSH. \"It has been exaggerated because of the press and television. The pictures have been repeated time after time. The message I will take back to Norway is 'business as usual'.\"</p> <p>In the end, the only obvious evidence the visitors saw of the crisis facing British agriculture was the disinfected straw mat at the entrance to the National Trust's Bodnant Garden, which has 100 magnificent magnolia-filled acres overlooking the Snowdon range.</p> <p>Jesper Ewald, general manager of FDM Travel in Denmark, wondered why no one had given him the Welsh hard sell before. \"It's something special, something unique,\" he said. \"Wales is just three hours away from Copenhagen but Danish people are much less aware of Wales than they are of Scotland and Ireland. You have nature, unspoiled nature. The accent is charming. Most Danes have no problem with English and the accent here is a bonus.\"</p> <p>Bodnant Garden, explained tour guide Nia Jones, was begun by a Victorian industrialist who discovered how to make soap white. But neither Ms Jones, nor officials from the British Tourist Authority who had arranged the trip as an antidote to the foot and mouth crisis, was offering any soft soap.</p> <p>\"We want to be as truthful with you as we can,\" said John Gaudern, manager of BTA's op eration in France. \"We have nothing to hide.\"</p> <p>At Conwy Castle, where a guano-stained Red Dragon fluttered from a flag pole, the visitors met Neville Hortop, a guide in RAF beret, green anorak and black and white walking stick who, at 77, still leads up to nine tours a day and jumps on litter bins to sell the castle's glory. \"Eight towers... 16 bedrooms... that's a lavatory... 1,500 English builders... Eleanor of Aquitaine came here.\"</p> <p>The group whizzed on to Plas Mawr, the finest Elizabethan town house in Britain.</p> <p>Before lunch (fish, no lamb or beef), Klaus Buhring, of a German tour company, had explained that German visitors were cancelling trips to Britain because they could not walk in the countryside they loved.</p> <p>\"The perception is that there are many restrictions on where people can go. Some have the idea that there will not be enough food, especially if they are self-catering.\"</p> <p>As the visitors prepared to board a steam-hauled Festiniog Railway carriage to Portmadog, some reflected that foot and mouth was not the only problem affecting tourism to Britain. It was clear to them that the strong pound should be painlessly culled, and probably incinerated to be on the safe side.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a

      "bodyText": "Not a pyre, not a burial pit in sight. But there were plenty of sheep chomping the grass of north Wales yesterday as 13 tourism managers from Europe trundled through the Snowdonia national park on a bus named Georgina. \"I have only been to London before,\" said Katia Longevale, partner of Claude Perignon, quality manager of Belgium's biggest tourism group. \"The nature here is very rough and there are a lot of sheep. We made a little joke that the tourist people had put them there for us.\" The implication was that the sheep were stuffed; but then a fat ewe and her triplets moved. They were part of a total Welsh herd which used to be estimated at 10m, but no one is counting now. Later a cloud of smoke drifted over trees in the Conwy valley near Llanwryst. It looked ominous but could have been innocent. \"I haven't seen any dead sheep and I didn't expect to see any,\" said Rolf Forsdahl, director of the Norwegian tour company HSH. \"It has been exaggerated because of the press and television. The pictures have been repeated time after time. The message I will take back to Norway is 'business as usual'.\" In the end, the only obvious evidence the visitors saw of the crisis facing British agriculture was the disinfected straw mat at the entrance to the National Trust's Bodnant Garden, which has 100 magnificent magnolia-filled acres overlooking the Snowdon range. Jesper Ewald, general manager of FDM Travel in Denmark, wondered why no one had given him the Welsh hard sell before. \"It's something special, something unique,\" he said. \"Wales is just three hours away from Copenhagen but Danish people are much less aware of Wales than they are of Scotland and Ireland. You have nature, unspoiled nature. The accent is charming. Most Danes have no problem with English and the accent here is a bonus.\" Bodnant Garden, explained tour guide Nia Jones, was begun by a Victorian industrialist who discovered how to make soap white. But neither Ms Jones, nor officials from the British Tourist Authority who had arranged the trip as an antidote to the foot and mouth crisis, was offering any soft soap. \"We want to be as truthful with you as we can,\" said John Gaudern, manager of BTA's op eration in France. \"We have nothing to hide.\" At Conwy Castle, where a guano-stained Red Dragon fluttered from a flag pole, the visitors met Neville Hortop, a guide in RAF beret, green anorak and black and white walking stick who, at 77, still leads up to nine tours a day and jumps on litter bins to sell the castle's glory. \"Eight towers... 16 bedrooms... that's a lavatory... 1,500 English builders... Eleanor of Aquitaine came here.\" The group whizzed on to Plas Mawr, the finest Elizabethan town house in Britain. Before lunch (fish, no lamb or beef), Klaus Buhring, of a German tour company, had explained that German visitors were cancelling trips to Britain because they could not walk in the countryside they loved. \"The perception is that there are many restrictions on where people can go. Some have the idea that there will not be enough food, especially if they are self-catering.\" As the visitors prepared to board a steam-hauled Festiniog Railway carriage to Portmadog, some reflected that foot and mouth was not the only problem affecting tourism to Britain. It was clear to them that the strong pound should be painlessly culled, and probably incinerated to be on the safe side.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Farmers in favour of a vaccination programme to fight the spread of foot and mouth believe that the National Farmers Union no longer represents their views, and yesterday accused it of being a mouthpiece for agribusiness.</p> <p>In an increasingly fraught atmosphere, the NFU leader, Ben Gill, admitted he was under enormous \"pressure\" from the government to accept a vaccination programme. He refused to give ground, however, saying the union was still not satisfied that the government had answered all its doubts on vaccination.</p> <p>The toll of animals to be destroyed continues to rise, with more than 2m condemned and 1,381 outbreaks. There are still more than 20 new cases a day, compared with 30 a week ago.</p> <p>In Cumbria, where most outbreaks are still occurring and vaccination teams are standing by should the NFU change tack, the view that the slaughter must stop is gaining support.</p> <p>Mike Downham, who farms 10 miles from the centre of the outbreak at Longtown, said: \"There is no doubt this culling out of farms represents armageddon for this county. It has been obvious for the last month that farming opinion has swung behind vaccination.\"</p> <p>He had his 20 pigs and 200 sheep culled to try to save pedigree cattle. \"I would rather have them vaccinated to keep them alive and argue about any compensation for loss of sales or other unforseen consequences afterwards.\"</p> <p>Mr Downham, a member of the NFU and the Soil Association, because he is switching to organic farming, said he had received 10 briefings from the Soil Association but nothing from the NFU. \"They have not canvassed opinion. In my view, people who want to continue farming want to save their stock by vaccination; those who want to retire or get out want a generous compensation cheque.\"</p> <p>A neighbour, Andrew Tompkins, who defected from the NFU, which cost him \u00a3300 a year, to the National Sheep Association, which has subscription of \u00a310, said: \"The NFU has been irritating the hell out of me. They put forward the views of the 20% of big farmers who get 80% of the subsidies, not family farms under 200 acres which form the majority in Cumbria.</p> <p>\"They are 10 to 20 years be hind the times, clinging on to the past subsidy regime and obstructing change.\" He is trying to keep 200 beef cattle alive and favours vaccination.</p> <p>In Monmouthshire, David Maddocks, once county chairman of the NFU, who resigned because he felt it no longer represented small farmers, said: \"The government and the NFU have always told us there is no alternative to slaughter, but that has not worked.</p> <p>\"Now the government has changed its mind, but the NFU has not. One has to ask who the NFU represent; they certainly do not look after the small farmer in Monmouthshire.</p> <p>\"Round here we have believed for some time that all this killing is outrageous, and we have favoured vaccination, but we have been subject to scare tactics and told it would not work.\"</p> <p>But Karen Dent disagreed. She has seen her pigs culled in an attempt to contain outbreaks near Penrith, and still has 570 dairy cows. \"Milk companies screw prices down, and down as it is I fear we would never be able to sell milk from vaccinated cows. There will be a stigma attached.</p> <p>\"I fear we would never be allowed to restock our pigs because our cows were vaccinated. I support the NFU... I believe they speak for the majority.\"</p> <p>The NFU has rivals for farmer membership, including the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) and the National Pig Association. The NPA is against vaccination. But the CLA believes that if scientific advice, \"as opposed to political expediency\", favours it, it would not object on behalf of 40,000 members, many of whom were in favour.</p> <p>Jim Scudamore, the chief vet, who was originally against vaccination, was wheeled out by Downing Street to give a briefing yesterday for the first time for four weeks. He thought a regional vaccination programme would help to eradicate the disease.</p> <p>\"Vaccination was ruled out [at first] because we had a clear stamping-out policy.\" But \"in certain circumstances\" it could protect animals, \"dampen down\" the disease and reduce the number of carcasses.</p> <p>The NFU said there were around 100,000 farm businesses, and it had 60,000 members. There were a lot more small farmers than large ones. There were perhaps only 2,000 farmers with 1,000 acres. The typical NFU member had around 150 acres.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth

      "bodyText": "Farmers in favour of a vaccination programme to fight the spread of foot and mouth believe that the National Farmers Union no longer represents their views, and yesterday accused it of being a mouthpiece for agribusiness. In an increasingly fraught atmosphere, the NFU leader, Ben Gill, admitted he was under enormous \"pressure\" from the government to accept a vaccination programme. He refused to give ground, however, saying the union was still not satisfied that the government had answered all its doubts on vaccination. The toll of animals to be destroyed continues to rise, with more than 2m condemned and 1,381 outbreaks. There are still more than 20 new cases a day, compared with 30 a week ago. In Cumbria, where most outbreaks are still occurring and vaccination teams are standing by should the NFU change tack, the view that the slaughter must stop is gaining support. Mike Downham, who farms 10 miles from the centre of the outbreak at Longtown, said: \"There is no doubt this culling out of farms represents armageddon for this county. It has been obvious for the last month that farming opinion has swung behind vaccination.\" He had his 20 pigs and 200 sheep culled to try to save pedigree cattle. \"I would rather have them vaccinated to keep them alive and argue about any compensation for loss of sales or other unforseen consequences afterwards.\" Mr Downham, a member of the NFU and the Soil Association, because he is switching to organic farming, said he had received 10 briefings from the Soil Association but nothing from the NFU. \"They have not canvassed opinion. In my view, people who want to continue farming want to save their stock by vaccination; those who want to retire or get out want a generous compensation cheque.\" A neighbour, Andrew Tompkins, who defected from the NFU, which cost him \u00a3300 a year, to the National Sheep Association, which has subscription of \u00a310, said: \"The NFU has been irritating the hell out of me. They put forward the views of the 20% of big farmers who get 80% of the subsidies, not family farms under 200 acres which form the majority in Cumbria. \"They are 10 to 20 years be hind the times, clinging on to the past subsidy regime and obstructing change.\" He is trying to keep 200 beef cattle alive and favours vaccination. In Monmouthshire, David Maddocks, once county chairman of the NFU, who resigned because he felt it no longer represented small farmers, said: \"The government and the NFU have always told us there is no alternative to slaughter, but that has not worked. \"Now the government has changed its mind, but the NFU has not. One has to ask who the NFU represent; they certainly do not look after the small farmer in Monmouthshire. \"Round here we have believed for some time that all this killing is outrageous, and we have favoured vaccination, but we have been subject to scare tactics and told it would not work.\" But Karen Dent disagreed. She has seen her pigs culled in an attempt to contain outbreaks near Penrith, and still has 570 dairy cows. \"Milk companies screw prices down, and down as it is I fear we would never be able to sell milk from vaccinated cows. There will be a stigma attached. \"I fear we would never be allowed to restock our pigs because our cows were vaccinated. I support the NFU... I believe they speak for the majority.\" The NFU has rivals for farmer membership, including the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) and the National Pig Association. The NPA is against vaccination. But the CLA believes that if scientific advice, \"as opposed to political expediency\", favours it, it would not object on behalf of 40,000 members, many of whom were in favour. Jim Scudamore, the chief vet, who was originally against vaccination, was wheeled out by Downing Street to give a briefing yesterday for the first time for four weeks. He thought a regional vaccination programme would help to eradicate the disease. \"Vaccination was ruled out [at first] because we had a clear stamping-out policy.\" But \"in certain circumstances\" it could protect animals, \"dampen down\" the disease and reduce the number of carcasses. The NFU said there were around 100,000 farm businesses, and it had 60,000 members. There were a lot more small farmers than large ones. There were perhaps only 2,000 farmers with 1,000 acres. The typical NFU member had around 150 acres. Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up More on the election and foot and mouth Politics: foot and mouth What's going on?

Today, when the South African high court reconvenes after a six-week adjournment, GlaxoSmithKline (along with the other 38 companies in the suit) have an opportunity to begin repairing the damage they have wreaked in South Africa. The controversial case was adjourned by the judge to give the drug giants time to answer detailed and highly embarrassing questions on the industry's pricing policies. Here is an opportunity for the drug bosses to help the developing world - and themselves. If they withdrew from the suit today, they could signal their support for cheaper drugs for developing states - and save the notoriously secretive industry from divulging sensitive commercial information. </p> <p>Rarely in the history of commerce has there been such a badly misjudged law suit. Even the industry now recognises what a PR disaster it has been. On the opening day of the civil trial there were protests and demonstrations against the drug companies round the world. Even before then, a succession of powerful international institutions had signalled their support for South Africa: the UN, World Health Organisation and the European Union. True, Tony Blair in a shameful and pusillanimous move sided with the drug giants three weeks ago, but GW Bush showed far more spunk than either Blair or Clinton. Initially, the US placed South Africa on its \"watch list\" of patent pirates, but Clinton relented and removed them. GW has gone much further.

It's about patents. Patents do not block medicines. They stimulate research and development.\" Developments since that bold assertion have shown just how wrong it was. To select just one. Protests by students and academic staff at Yale, where a key ingredient of two Aids drugs sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb was invented (and earned the university $40m a year in royalties), prompted the company to drop its price from $20 to $2 for a daily dose. Better still, the company dropped its patent protection rights in South Africa. If Bristol-Myers can do this, why can the other 38 not follow?

But Africa faces a crisis. Cheaper drugs would be an enormous help as Brazil has demonstrated. There are 4.7m people infected in South Africa and 25m in sub-Saharan Africa. Drug prices have belatedly been cut and new partnerships begun. The long-term solution is a vaccine, which new international bodies are pursuing. Meanwhile, in the short-term, an industry which rightly sees the need to improve its image, has to demonstrate it is not just shareholder driven but recognises the public interest too.</p>",

If the US economy continues to falter and Japan fades as growth projections for the euro-zone tumble, wage earners will be hurt. </p> <p>But joblessness is not part of the third way script, which is all economic benignity and worker-employer accord. As jobs are lost, neither the Blairites nor the centre-left governments of Paris and Berlin are likely to have a coherent response. </p> <p>That much has become clear in France. On Tuesday Prime Minister Lionel Jospin dramatically went on television to damp down smouldering discontent about his leadership since the left lost unexpectedly in the March municipal elections. Everything is now bound up with the challenge to Jacques Chirac for the presidency next year. What the French public wants is a positive response to a recent spate of headlines about job losses, symbolised by the summary closure of Marks &amp; Spencer. Unemployment among under 25s is still 16%. The chart shows long-term unemployment for the most recent year for which comparable figures exist; it has since gone down but remains a problem. </p> <p>The French left does not lack a political vocabulary with which to respond. I believe in the public service, Mr Jospin told viewers. Look at what has happened to the railways in the UK and electricity in California: we are going to avoid that. </p> <p>But Anglo-Saxon capitalism is not the only culprit. Philips, cutting 7,000 jobs, is a Dutch firm forced to rationalise production because the mobile phone market is saturated. Its factory in Le Mans will be a casualty of demand. Strikes to ward off redundancies at Air Libert\u00e9 and Air Littoral - French-owned - will not win more travellers. Danone, also French, is cutting jobs in its biscuit division to concentrate on other food lines. All of that could sound like \"normal\" operations; Joseph Schumpeter called it capitalism's creative destructiveness. </p> <p>Mr Jospin has talked about increasing the cost of lay-offs to employers and hinted at increasing the minimum wage, due to be revised in June. The logic of profit should not roll out at the expense of employment, he said. In terms of practical policies, however, the left response turns out to be upping civil servants' salaries, along with social welfare measures on housing and support in old age and subsidies to help small companies adjust to the compulsory 35-hour week. Public spending will rise as a result, pushing France close to the the Brussels' stability pact limit. </p> <p>The picture is not all gloomy. French unemployment reached a 10-year low in January at 9% and job creation is set to continue this year, though only 15% of the likely 250,000-300,000 new jobs can be attributed to the government's special measures. Mr Jospin's supporters say that taken together his policies do represent a \"traditional left\" response, which should be contrasted with Tony Blair or Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. But critics say the radicalism of Mr Jospin's words conceal the \"immobility of his actions\". </p> <p>For the Jospin coalition of socialists, communists and greens is going to be no more able to arrest the economic cycle than the ideologically pallid Blair government. This week the Bank of France projected growth in French GDP this year at between 2.6% and 2.9%, down from the 3.3% plus achieved last year. Economists hope for a recovery to 3% in 2002 - which could well mean aggregate improvement in jobs. Schumpeter again. If France is, as some say, the most dynamic of Europe's leading economies, the government will have to take the rough with the smooth. </p> <p>In Germany, Chancellor Schr\u00f6der recently blotted his copybook with the left when he said unemployment pay should be tightened in order to get more people into the available jobs. \"There is no right to idleness in our society. Someone who is able to work but doesn't want to cannot rely on other people's solidarity.\" Such sentiments, unexceptionable in Blairite Britain, caused a storm among the Social Democrats, who share federal power with the Greens. </p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der has tied his political fortunes to the promise to cut unemployment below 3.5m. It now stands at 3.8m or just over 9% of the labour force. Part of the effort will be undertaken by the labour ministry which is working on legislation to force local job centres to cut or freeze benefits to unemployed people who turn down job offers or fail to seek further qualifications. </p> <p>German growth projections have had to be cut in response to the American downturn. Fingers have been burnt by the collapse of hi-tech stocks; the chart shows that many Germans have recently become shareholders. German GDP is predicted to rise by 2.1% this year, down from last year's 2.7%. Lower growth will cut tax revenues, pushing public finances into the red; the Germans may be reprimanded when EU finance ministers meet next month. </p> <p>Despite all that, the centre-left in Germany - as in France and the UK - possesses a signal political advantage. The state of the right. Though the Christian Democrats did reasonably well in elections in Hesse and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, and the French right did creditably in mayoral races, in neither country are they convincing the public that they are an alternative to social democracy. As in the UK, conservatives are as tongue-tied as the left when it comes to explaining and justifying the ups and downs of employment. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:david.walker@theguardian.com\">david.walker@theguardian.com</a></p>",

In Germany, Chancellor Schr\u00f6der recently blotted his copybook with the left when he said unemployment pay should be tightened in order to get more people into the available jobs. \"There is no right to idleness in our society. Someone who is able to work but doesn't want to cannot rely on other people's solidarity.\" Such sentiments, unexceptionable in Blairite Britain, caused a storm among the Social Democrats, who share federal power with the Greens. Mr Schr\u00f6der has tied his political fortunes to the promise to cut unemployment below 3.5m. It now stands at 3.8m or just over 9% of the labour force. Part of the effort will be undertaken by the labour ministry which is working on legislation to force local job centres to cut or freeze benefits to unemployed people who turn down job offers or fail to seek further qualifications. German growth projections have had to be cut in response to the American downturn. Fingers have been burnt by the collapse of hi-tech stocks; the chart shows that many Germans have recently become shareholders. German GDP is predicted to rise by 2.1% this year, down from last year's 2.7%. Lower growth will cut tax revenues, pushing public finances into the red; the Germans may be reprimanded when EU finance ministers meet next month. Despite all that, the centre-left in Germany - as in France and the UK - possesses a signal political advantage. The state of the right. Though the Christian Democrats did reasonably well in elections in Hesse and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, and the French right did creditably in mayoral races, in neither country are they convincing the public that they are an alternative to social democracy. As in the UK, conservatives are as tongue-tied as the left when it comes to explaining and justifying the ups and downs of employment. david.walker@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>The spin doctors have been hired, lobbyists put on the payroll and giant posters of his face plastered across billboards to rally support and remind people why they voted for him in the first place. Transport and law and order are among his key policies, including a significant increase in police numbers and possibly the return of a school-based police cadet force. He preaches the value of working with business leaders and pursues \"big tent\" politics, discarding old left-right divides to seek consensus where possible.</p> <p>The best of the private sector, on salaries the public sector can barely afford, have been hired to inject expertise and dynamism into ailing bodies while a prominent union leader was urged to call off a strike to avoid inconveniencing the public. He bows his head at meetings of the Queen and enjoyed cracking a joke with the Queen Mother. And yesterday, after a meeting with senior police officers, he rallied behind the boys and girls in blue and issued a strong condemnation of the planned May Day protests in London. All very New Labour.</p> <p>Ken Livingstone is the dog that did not bite, barely barking during his first year as mayor of London. Even the tabloids rarely call him \"Red Ken\" these days. The Mr Livingstone currently presiding in the Greater London Authority's Romney House HQ is a very different beast to the Mr Livingstone of the Greater London Council and County Hall fame.</p> <p>Perhaps power has brought its own responsibility, leaving Livingstone a prisoner of a political system that has prevented him making much difference to the lives of Londoners, squeezed by the Treasury and Whitehall from above while below the borough councils jealously defend their turf. The approach of the first anniversary of Livingstone's election on May 4 risks leaving Tony Blair's warning that a Livingstone victory would spell \"disaster for London\" sounding increasingly hysterical. Trafalgar Square's last licensed seller of pigeon seed has gone and Major General Sir Henry Havelock and General Sir Charles Napier are threatened with expulsion, but the removal from a piazza of birds and a couple of statues is hardly a record to crow about.</p> <p>Livingstone has made most running on London Underground, opposing (with public support) John Prescott's plans to part-privatise the network in favour of a modernisation scheme that would use private funds to modernise a publicly owned network. Yet even here Livingstone has shown signs of New Labour largesse, appointing as transport commissioner Bob Kiley, a former senior CIA officer before he ran the New York subway, paying his recruit up to \u00a3500,000 a year and buying him a \u00a32.1m house .</p> <p>The mayor appeared to veer left by publicly refusing to condemn tube strikers earlier this year and proclaiming he might even join them on the picket line, but officials in the Aslef drivers' union report he was privately urging its general secretary to call off the stoppage.</p> <p>The stand-off over the tube is the one area where there is real conflict with the government, Livingstone yesterday announcing another advertising campaign to highlight safety fears ahead of his threatened legal challenge. But privately Livingstone has disclosed that he is keen to compromise and anxious to avoid a showdown, telling a meeting with MPs in Labour's leftwing campaign group last month that a resolution would be the best solution. The mayor, who conceded that his lawyers had warned he could lose any court action, told the surprised MPs he had spoken to Blair's Downing Street \"gatekeeper\" Anji Hunter and held discussions with Prescott.</p> <p>Yesterday's denunciation of May 1's monopoly board protesters, threatening to wreck shops and offices of the streets on capitalism's most famous board game, is also a change of tack in office. Livingstone was accused last year of encouraging riots. Mr Livingstone rejected the allegations and later branded the demonstra tors as \"mindless thugs\". In office, however, his uncompromising position - endorsing the police's \"zero tolerance\" response and urging protesters to stay away - was unequivocal. Then there are the speeches in the City, praising the value of the financial institutions to the capital, and arguing forcefully that Britain must join the single currency. And eyebrows were raised when Lord Rogers was appointed at \u00a31,625 a day to advise on architectural matters.</p> <p>The billboards of Livingstone peering at voters were devised under a \u00a320m two-year campaign to win public support for congestion charges. With New Labour, lobbyists are never far away. Livingstone is paying Fishburn Hedges an estimated \u00a3100,000 a month for advice.</p> <p>At the Westminster meeting with his old campaign group comrades, at least one disgruntled leftwing MP suggested that Livingstone was seeking an accommodation rather than confrontation with the government in the hope that a new-found respectability would pave the way for his return to the Labour party. Not so, said the mayor. That was up to Blair. For him, the priority was a second term as mayor. Whether it was as an independent or Labour candidate mattered less.</p> <p>His performance so far, however, supporting the police and promoting business, is hardly likely to harm the prospect of an invitation. To some Livingstone will have been a disappointment; to others a relief.</p> <p>Livingstone used to boast that he was a parent of New Labour, pioneering modern campaign techniques such as posters and concerts in his battle with Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s over abolition of the GLC. Others on the Labour left claim he was always New Labour in methods if not policies - singlemindedly promoting the Livingstone brand above the party, continually seeking alliances to advance himself and, according to former allies, prepared to dump supporters who have outlived their usefulness.</p> <p>In many respects Blair failed to appreciate that Livingstone the politician, like himself, above all else would want to be re-elected. Derision has been repeatedly heaped on Blair for using public funds to produce an annual report applauding the government's efforts and lauding its achievements. Livingstone is now proposing to send out his own glossy document to London's 2.75m homes this summer, detailing his achievements during his first year in office.</p> <p>The mayor is legally obliged to distribute a performance report so critics, particularly those inside the Labour party, quip that he should send out postcards. But Livingstone favours a \u00a3940,000 version including an interview of the mayor by actress Helen Mirren with his comments interspaced with pictures of Ali G and Jack Dee, who will declare why they love London. So very New Labour.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:kevin.maguire@theguardian.com\">kevin.maguire@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The spin doctors have been hired, lobbyists put on the payroll and giant posters of his face plastered across billboards to rally support and remind people why they voted for him in the first place. Transport and law and order are among his key policies, including a significant increase in police numbers and possibly the return of a school-based police cadet force. He preaches the value of working with business leaders and pursues \"big tent\" politics, discarding old left-right divides to seek consensus where possible. The best of the private sector, on salaries the public sector can barely afford, have been hired to inject expertise and dynamism into ailing bodies while a prominent union leader was urged to call off a strike to avoid inconveniencing the public. He bows his head at meetings of the Queen and enjoyed cracking a joke with the Queen Mother. And yesterday, after a meeting with senior police officers, he rallied behind the boys and girls in blue and issued a strong condemnation of the planned May Day protests in London. All very New Labour. Ken Livingstone is the dog that did not bite, barely barking during his first year as mayor of London. Even the tabloids rarely call him \"Red Ken\" these days. The Mr Livingstone currently presiding in the Greater London Authority's Romney House HQ is a very different beast to the Mr Livingstone of the Greater London Council and County Hall fame. Perhaps power has brought its own responsibility, leaving Livingstone a prisoner of a political system that has prevented him making much difference to the lives of Londoners, squeezed by the Treasury and Whitehall from above while below the borough councils jealously defend their turf. The approach of the first anniversary of Livingstone's election on May 4 risks leaving Tony Blair's warning that a Livingstone victory would spell \"disaster for London\" sounding increasingly hysterical. Trafalgar Square's last licensed seller of pigeon seed has gone and Major General Sir Henry Havelock and General Sir Charles Napier are threatened with expulsion, but the removal from a piazza of birds and a couple of statues is hardly a record to crow about. Livingstone has made most running on London Underground, opposing (with public support) John Prescott's plans to part-privatise the network in favour of a modernisation scheme that would use private funds to modernise a publicly owned network. Yet even here Livingstone has shown signs of New Labour largesse, appointing as transport commissioner Bob Kiley, a former senior CIA officer before he ran the New York subway, paying his recruit up to \u00a3500,000 a year and buying him a \u00a32.1m house . The mayor appeared to veer left by publicly refusing to condemn tube strikers earlier this year and proclaiming he might even join them on the picket line, but officials in the Aslef drivers' union report he was privately urging its general secretary to call off the stoppage. The stand-off over the tube is the one area where there is real conflict with the government, Livingstone yesterday announcing another advertising campaign to highlight safety fears ahead of his threatened legal challenge. But privately Livingstone has disclosed that he is keen to compromise and anxious to avoid a showdown, telling a meeting with MPs in Labour's leftwing campaign group last month that a resolution would be the best solution. The mayor, who conceded that his lawyers had warned he could lose any court action, told the surprised MPs he had spoken to Blair's Downing Street \"gatekeeper\" Anji Hunter and held discussions with Prescott. Yesterday's denunciation of May 1's monopoly board protesters, threatening to wreck shops and offices of the streets on capitalism's most famous board game, is also a change of tack in office. Livingstone was accused last year of encouraging riots. Mr Livingstone rejected the allegations and later branded the demonstra tors as \"mindless thugs\". In office, however, his uncompromising position - endorsing the police's \"zero tolerance\" response and urging protesters to stay away - was unequivocal. Then there are the speeches in the City, praising the value of the financial institutions to the capital, and arguing forcefully that Britain must join the single currency. And eyebrows were raised when Lord Rogers was appointed at \u00a31,625 a day to advise on architectural matters. The billboards of Livingstone peering at voters were devised under a \u00a320m two-year campaign to win public support for congestion charges. With New Labour, lobbyists are never far away. Livingstone is paying Fishburn Hedges an estimated \u00a3100,000 a month for advice. At the Westminster meeting with his old campaign group comrades, at least one disgruntled leftwing MP suggested that Livingstone was seeking an accommodation rather than confrontation with the government in the hope that a new-found respectability would pave the way for his return to the Labour party. Not so, said the mayor. That was up to Blair. For him, the priority was a second term as mayor. Whether it was as an independent or Labour candidate mattered less. His performance so far, however, supporting the police and promoting business, is hardly likely to harm the prospect of an invitation. To some Livingstone will have been a disappointment; to others a relief. Livingstone used to boast that he was a parent of New Labour, pioneering modern campaign techniques such as posters and concerts in his battle with Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s over abolition of the GLC. Others on the Labour left claim he was always New Labour in methods if not policies - singlemindedly promoting the Livingstone brand above the party, continually seeking alliances to advance himself and, according to former allies, prepared to dump supporters who have outlived their usefulness. In many respects Blair failed to appreciate that Livingstone the politician, like himself, above all else would want to be re-elected. Derision has been repeatedly heaped on Blair for using public funds to produce an annual report applauding the government's efforts and lauding its achievements. Livingstone is now proposing to send out his own glossy document to London's 2.75m homes this summer, detailing his achievements during his first year in office. The mayor is legally obliged to distribute a performance report so critics, particularly those inside the Labour party, quip that he should send out postcards. But Livingstone favours a \u00a3940,000 version including an interview of the mayor by actress Helen Mirren with his comments interspaced with pictures of Ali G and Jack Dee, who will declare why they love London. So very New Labour. kevin.maguire@theguardian.com",

They also owe it to the referendum result they want. The plausible future that events should force upon them is not helping a party led by Michael Portillo, but leaving, and thus destroying, one led by Iain Duncan Smith. hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

Some Tories want to sell the party's planned cuts in public spending as equivalent to the tax cutting programme which helped Bush to victory. The Conservatives have so far promised to spend \u00a38bn less in 2003-04 than Labour proposed in the budget. However, Mr Portillo's deputy, Oliver Letwin, the shadow chief secretary, believes the party can gain votes in the election by promising additional spending and tax cuts in the succeeding years. He has calculated, taking into account the relative size of the British and American economies, that the cuts could be portrayed as equivalent to the US trillion dollar tax cutting programme. Other shadow cabinet members reckon the strategy will play into the hands of Labour and undermine the Conservative commitment to improving public services. One said: \"This is madness. If Portillo buys this, he can say goodbye to winning the support of the left in any leadership battle\" The row comes as Michael Ancram, the Conservative chairman, fought off claims that the party's election drive was being destroyed by internecine manouverings over its leadership after the election. Tory peers last night called for members to come to their senses and back William Hague's leadership. There was a growing sense last night that Mr Hague's leadership within the shadow cabinet was being undermined by the camps of his rivals openly challenging his authority. Mr Hague's position was not strengthened when Lady Thatcher conspicuously failed to back his leadership despite a call for her to do so by her former principal private secretary, Gerald Howarth. Lady Thatcher instead attacked Tony Blair's handling of the foot and mouth crisis. Mr Ancram claimed the speculation had been initially fuelled by John Stevens, the pro-euro Conservative. He asserted he had been asked by the former chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, to drop plans to challenge Mr Portillo in his Kensington and Chelsea constituency. Mr Stevens claimed this was part of a wider realignment between Mr Portillo and Mr Clarke. Mr Clarke subsequently said he was bemused by such suggestions, but typically took days to come up with his denial, fuelling speculation about an alliance between himself and Mr Portillo. Attention within the party is now focusing on the extent to which Mr Portillo could move himself to the centre and so ease a pact with Mr Clarke. Mr Portillo's deputy, Mr Letwin, one of the rising stars of the party, believes the electorate will be convinced by a right of centre party. Although the Conservatives are already committed to reducing the planned path of spending by \u00a38bn a year less than Gordon Brown intends by 2003-04, Mr Letwin stresses this takes the Conservatives only to the middle of the next parliament. He believes the Conservatives can promise further tax cuts in the later years of the parliament by keeping public spending growth within the growth rate of the economy. Mr Letwin has pointed out that in the medium term his plans could match president Bush's plans for $1.6 trillion cumulative tax reduction for 10 years. He claims that once these tax cuts have been divided by 10, and allowing for the fact that the American economy is seven-and-a-half times bigger than Britain's, the gap between Republican and Tory radicalism is \"pretty small\". Mr Portillo has so far refused to say whether in principle he would want to keep public spending below the level of economic growth after 2003-04.",

David Smith, an inspector with the health and safety executive, told the inquest: \"Only a small force would have been necessary to cause [the gravestone] to fall, because it had not been built on a rigid foundation.\" Councils nationwide have been in touch with Harrogate, which was in the midst of a five-year programme of improving safety in cemeteries when the accident happened. A spokesman said that the project had since been hastened.",

      "byline": "Simon Bowers",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>\u0095 Heartiest Diary congratulations to Basingstoke-based computer manufacturer Centerprise. Not only was it named Hampshire Business of the Year last year, but yesterday it emerged that the ambitious hardware firm is supplying one of Europe's highest profile online retailers . . . we refer, of course, to Letsbuyit.com. Centerprise, reports excellent website The Register, has agreed to build own-brand Letsbuyit PCs - to be labelled \"Ants\", after the animated creatures that appear in the retailer's television adverts. </p> <p>With so many former suppliers giving Letsbuyit the cold shoulder, it warms the heart to see the e-tailer receiving a helping hand after an unfortunate spell in the Amsterdam courts earlier this year. Nevertheless, the company's cynical detractors - who, to this day, unfairly liken the firm to the living dead - will doubtless dredge up allegations submitted to the court by Dutch administrators, concerning Letsbuyit's former senior executives' understanding of the \"financial obligations of the company\". Not us. We salute Centerprise, who appear unconcerned with Letsbuyit's background, and wish it the best of fortune. </p> <p>\u0095 Investing in the stock market is a grave matter. This is why we are grateful for an invite, from US online financial newswire TheStreet.com, to attend \"one of the premier investment conferences in the country\". Delegates will be able to take advantage of 200 workshops and five panel discussions \"to hone your investment skills\". \"You will learn how to devise a clear-cut investment strategy that shows you how to invest for the reality of wealth - not the pipe dream of overnight riches,\" reads the sober invitation. How long before delegates tire and turn to some of the conference's fringe investment workshops one imagines on offer at the chosen venue - the Paris hotel and casino in Las Vegas - we dare not speculate. </p> <p>\u0095 Excitement mounts in the run up to the UK oil and gas industry's publication of its Sustainable Development Strategy next week. Whether use of the word \"sustainable\" anticipates the unveiling of a miracle emissionless fossil fuel, or whether it denotes a cynical hijacking of tree-huggers' jargon, it is too early to say. </p> <p>\u0095 So to the Diary's ongoing investigation into reports that staff at Vodafone's head office in Newbury are having trouble receiving a clear signal on their mobile phones - despite claims that the Vodafone network offers 99% coverage throughout Britain. During our initial inquiries, you will recall, a woman from Vodafone's service centre assured us that reception in Newbury town centre was quite sufficient, and that any problems \"could be to do with building structures, and nothing to do with coverage provided by Vodafone\". Not satisfied with this baffling response, we call the Newbury office direct, employ a cunning subterfuge. \"Hello, hello? Can you hear me?\" we begin. \"Pardon? . . . What? . . . Look, this is a very bad line - can I have your mobile number, and I'll call you back?\" \"Er, no. You can't,\" comes the reply. \"If you can't hear me on this line, I'm not giving you my mobile number.\" And with that, the rather nervous sounding staff member hangs up. Hmm. </p> <p>\u0095 Our thanks to Jon Rhodes who emails to point out that the Harvard Business Review - which, we reported yesterday, has been voted \"most influential magazine in America by 1,700 opinion leaders\" - is not only exclusively available to \"an elite corps of top of top business managers\", as it may imply. In fact, Mr Rhodes writes, \"WH Smith in Euston definitely has the most recent copy\". </p> <p>That may be so, Mr Rhodes but it will not stop us featuring an edited extract from HBR's impressive website tomorrow.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Heartiest Diary congratulations to Basingstoke-based computer manufacturer Centerprise. Not only was it named Hampshire Business of the Year last year, but yesterday it emerged that the ambitious hardware firm is supplying one of Europe's highest profile online retailers . . . we refer, of course, to Letsbuyit.com. Centerprise, reports excellent website The Register, has agreed to build own-brand Letsbuyit PCs - to be labelled \"Ants\", after the animated creatures that appear in the retailer's television adverts. With so many former suppliers giving Letsbuyit the cold shoulder, it warms the heart to see the e-tailer receiving a helping hand after an unfortunate spell in the Amsterdam courts earlier this year. Nevertheless, the company's cynical detractors - who, to this day, unfairly liken the firm to the living dead - will doubtless dredge up allegations submitted to the court by Dutch administrators, concerning Letsbuyit's former senior executives' understanding of the \"financial obligations of the company\". Not us. We salute Centerprise, who appear unconcerned with Letsbuyit's background, and wish it the best of fortune. \u0095 Investing in the stock market is a grave matter. This is why we are grateful for an invite, from US online financial newswire TheStreet.com, to attend \"one of the premier investment conferences in the country\". Delegates will be able to take advantage of 200 workshops and five panel discussions \"to hone your investment skills\". \"You will learn how to devise a clear-cut investment strategy that shows you how to invest for the reality of wealth - not the pipe dream of overnight riches,\" reads the sober invitation. How long before delegates tire and turn to some of the conference's fringe investment workshops one imagines on offer at the chosen venue - the Paris hotel and casino in Las Vegas - we dare not speculate. \u0095 Excitement mounts in the run up to the UK oil and gas industry's publication of its Sustainable Development Strategy next week. Whether use of the word \"sustainable\" anticipates the unveiling of a miracle emissionless fossil fuel, or whether it denotes a cynical hijacking of tree-huggers' jargon, it is too early to say. \u0095 So to the Diary's ongoing investigation into reports that staff at Vodafone's head office in Newbury are having trouble receiving a clear signal on their mobile phones - despite claims that the Vodafone network offers 99% coverage throughout Britain. During our initial inquiries, you will recall, a woman from Vodafone's service centre assured us that reception in Newbury town centre was quite sufficient, and that any problems \"could be to do with building structures, and nothing to do with coverage provided by Vodafone\". Not satisfied with this baffling response, we call the Newbury office direct, employ a cunning subterfuge. \"Hello, hello? Can you hear me?\" we begin. \"Pardon? . . . What? . . . Look, this is a very bad line - can I have your mobile number, and I'll call you back?\" \"Er, no. You can't,\" comes the reply. \"If you can't hear me on this line, I'm not giving you my mobile number.\" And with that, the rather nervous sounding staff member hangs up. Hmm. \u0095 Our thanks to Jon Rhodes who emails to point out that the Harvard Business Review - which, we reported yesterday, has been voted \"most influential magazine in America by 1,700 opinion leaders\" - is not only exclusively available to \"an elite corps of top of top business managers\", as it may imply. In fact, Mr Rhodes writes, \"WH Smith in Euston definitely has the most recent copy\". That may be so, Mr Rhodes but it will not stop us featuring an edited extract from HBR's impressive website tomorrow. The subject of the piece is corporate egos. simon.bowers@theguardian.com",

Protesters from the Free Tibet Campaign demonstrated outside the multinational's annual general meeting at London's Royal Festival Hall. The campaigners are trying to get a resolution passed at the AGM for BP to sell its 2.2% interest in PetroChina, whose parent company is building gas pipelines in Tibet. Protesters held a Tibetan flag and chanted \"BP - out of Tibet\". Gedun Rinchen, 52, who said he was a former political prisoner from Tibet, claimed the developments would promote jobs solely for Chinese nationals. BP also faced pressure from Greenpeace, which is putting forward a motion calling on the group to publish a report showing how it will make the transition to renewable sources of energy. Stephanie Tunmore, 46, from Greenpeace, said: \"We want them to report on how they will move away from fossil fuels.\" And the firm was also criticised by US campaigners Public Interest Research Group, which attempted to get a motion heard calling on the firm to assess the impact of drilling for oil in the Arctic. Rene Wendell, 30, from Massachusetts, USA, demonstrating with a blow up caribou, said: \"We want BP to live up to their environmental image and cancel plans for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\" He said it was estimated caribou numbers - currently150,000 - would diminish by 40% if exploration went ahead.

Growing volumes of rubbish and excessive energy consumption are blamed. According to a recent survey by the Wild Bird Society of Japan, the crow population of Tokyo has risen from 20,000 to 30,000 since 1998. In the past 15 years it is believed to have more than quadrupled. The Japanese capital has been taken over by Corvus macrorhynchos - south-east Asian jungle crows - which have wingspans of up to a metre, sharp beaks and a feisty attitude. Signs in Hibiya park, close to the Imperial palace, warn pedestrians to beware of the birds, which reportedly make hundreds of attacks each year, mostly during the April to June breeding season. The domestic media report that in the worst affected areas many women carry umbrellas to protect themselves. During the lean new year period, when the country closes down, the birds have been known to prey on kittens and small dogs. The rise in the number of crows has been attributed to two environmental problems: rubbish and heat. Tokyo produces a vast and growing amount of refuse, which the residents carefully sort. But the authorities' insistence on the use of transparent binliners to ensure that the rubbish is sorted correctly is believed to have made it easier for the sharp-eyed birds to find food. The city's temperature is also to their liking, thanks to the \"heat island\" effect produced by the dense population, high volume of traffic and a concrete environment which traps the warmth. After a growing number of complaints, the metropolitan government has distributed nets to protect rubbish sites from the birds and dispatched exterminators to destroy their nests.

Yesterday, Brigadier Malcolm Wood, deputy director of Whitehall's foot and mouth coordination committee, told journalists the army had \"responded quickly and appropriately\" to requests for help. He declined to elaborate, saying any decision was a matter of policy, and, as such, for ministers to comment on.</p> <p>Other officers privately made clear they believed the army should have been asked much sooner. \"I don't think any of us doubt we should have been called in earlier\", said one.</p> <p>It was not until March 23, after Tony Blair had announced he would personally take charge, that the army set up a command and control operation to organise logistics. This was more than a month after the first case in Essex.</p> <p>Officers yesterday pointed to an army report after the outbreak in 1967, saying in any future outbreak it should be brought in straight away \"to ensure [the disease] did not develop into a major problem\".</p> <p>By the time in 1967 the army was called in, 12 days into the crisis, \"there was already a large backlog of carcasses awaiting destruction, and of farms awaiting disinfection\", and Maff was unable to cope, said the report. \"Once the army were called in to assist,\" it added, \"there was a rapid improvement... It became possible to establish a proper system of operational control.\"</p> <p>The report concluded: \"In a national emergency of this nature, the earlier the military can be called in the better.\"</p> <p>Iain Duncan Smith, the shadow defence secretary, last night accused the government of having ignored the 1967 report because it did not want the present outbreak to look like a crisis

      "bodyText": "Senior military officers said yesterday that the army ought to have been brought in much earlier to help cope with the foot and mouth crisis. Publicly the army has been reluctant to comment. Yesterday, Brigadier Malcolm Wood, deputy director of Whitehall's foot and mouth coordination committee, told journalists the army had \"responded quickly and appropriately\" to requests for help. He declined to elaborate, saying any decision was a matter of policy, and, as such, for ministers to comment on. Other officers privately made clear they believed the army should have been asked much sooner. \"I don't think any of us doubt we should have been called in earlier\", said one. It was not until March 23, after Tony Blair had announced he would personally take charge, that the army set up a command and control operation to organise logistics. This was more than a month after the first case in Essex. Officers yesterday pointed to an army report after the outbreak in 1967, saying in any future outbreak it should be brought in straight away \"to ensure [the disease] did not develop into a major problem\". By the time in 1967 the army was called in, 12 days into the crisis, \"there was already a large backlog of carcasses awaiting destruction, and of farms awaiting disinfection\", and Maff was unable to cope, said the report. \"Once the army were called in to assist,\" it added, \"there was a rapid improvement... It became possible to establish a proper system of operational control.\" The report concluded: \"In a national emergency of this nature, the earlier the military can be called in the better.\" Iain Duncan Smith, the shadow defence secretary, last night accused the government of having ignored the 1967 report because it did not want the present outbreak to look like a crisis and have to move the election date.

But now he is in the White House, George Bush is proving that to a Texan with campaign debts, oil is thicker than blood. His interior secretary, Gale Norton, has rejected an appeal from the younger Bush sibling to halt the auction of 2.4m hectares (6m acres) of seabed off the Florida coast to oil companies for exploration and drilling. The appeal put the president in a delicate position. On the one hand, his government is trying to open up the Arctic national wildlife refuge in Alaska and parts of the Rockies to oil exploration, on the grounds that the country is facing a critical energy shortage. With the potential yield of up to 2bn barrels of oil and billions of cubic metres of natural gas, the Gulf of Mexico site is even more important. Oil companies looking forward to bidding in the auction of leases later this year made generous donations to the Bush election campaign. On the other hand, giving the green light to drilling could destroy Jeb Bush's chance of being re-elected next year: a chance already damaged by the well-publicised intervention of his officials in his brother's favour during the Florida recount. In an impassioned letter to the interior department in January, three days after his brother's inauguration, Jeb wrote: \"Florida's economy is based upon tourism and other activities that depend on a clean and healthy environment.

They want the university to use its patent rights to make Glaxo halt its case against the sale of generic drugs. A similar Yale lobby of the US company Bristol Myers Squibb succeeded month.",

More than 130 former pupils of the reformatory, at Letterfrack in the Connemara mountains in the west, have made statements regarding conditions from the 1940s to 1975, when the school was closed. Gardai have spent five years on the investigation, one of the largest ever undertaken in the republic, and have sent more than 12 to the director of public prosecutions after questioning former inmates living in Britain, Germany and the US. The school, set up by the Roman Catholic order in 1884, took in boys aged six to 16, who were either orphans, came from broken homes, or were deemed to be young offenders. The inquiry started in 1996 when a man claimed he had been assaulted there as a child, following reports of past abuse in institutions run by the Christian Brothers in Ireland. Others came forward to police with harrowing accounts after hearing about the investigation on television and radio. Martin Cawley, who spent five years in Letterfrack, said: \"We were beaten on the head with hurley sticks, scalded with hot water, and then thrown into icy water. We were ordered to stay in the freezing tub, and if we tried to get out we were battered with a leather strap.\" Some of the alleged perpetrators, priests and lay staff, are dead.

Sections of the script were edited down to 160 characters and used as short teaser pieces, aimed at enhancing the performances and adding new insights into the characters' lives. More than 400 people subscribed to the week-long project - no mean trick for a piece of fringe theatre. </p> <p>The theatre project was designed in collaboration with Huddersfield's digital design laboratory, TEST, which is now working on an SMS version of <a href=\"http://www.knowitall.org.uk\">www.knowitall.org.uk</a> - a GCSE revision site backed by Knowlsey Local Education Authority. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Fiddian Warman and Siobhan Hapaska are building an SMS sculpture near Loch Lomond in Scotland.

Telephony, a recent show by Jon Thomson and Alison Craighead, consisted of a bank of mobile phones set out in the form of a grid.

In the UK, the Talking Pages at www.bbc.co.uk works in a similar way, selecting the best readers' letters on current news and sport topics, often featuring an impressive range of international contributions. The only catch is that there is nowhere else on the site for the postings not considered up to scratch, so many carefully worded contributions are in vain. A better bet to see your letters published online is at www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/index/talk, the most active of all the UK newspaper forum pages, with current hot debates on \"who to vote for at the next election\" and several threads to offload your ire about the president of the USA on Politics Talk. Alternatively, if you want to find out what people are thinking in other countries, look through www.newsdirectory.com which links to major newspapers and magazines the world over.",

      "body": "<p>The bloke who used to be head of IT at my old office, Pete, had a very clear idea of why he spent so much of his time trying to undo the crashes that I, or other \"laydeez\" had caused by trying to log on. \"They just ain't compatible, girls and computers,\" he used to whine, as he thundered across my keyboard for the fifth time in a week. \"Women just don't have the right sort of brains.\" </p> <p>The latest research studies in the US, however, show that there is now \"gender parity\" in internet use and at first glance, these statistics suggest that, far from being web illiterate, women are (surprise, surprise) just as competent as men. </p> <p>At a recent conference organised by Marketing Week, entitled Women on the Web - reaching beyond gender stereotypes online - Philip Bird from Microsoft's MSN, gave these new statistics further relevance. </p> <p>\"What is happening with the net in the US today,\" he stated unequivocally, \"will happen here 14 months later. In the UK at present there is still a male bias - but I expect it to be a 50:50 ratio very soon.\" (Cue a mass pinging of braces across adland) </p> <p>Such conviction (or is it merely optimism?) was echoed by other speakers at the event - to the glee of the gathered managing directors and brand managers. According to Hilary Groves of iVillage UK, \"Women are one of the fastest growing internet segments\". </p> <p>Her arrival in Britain is testament to her company's confidence. Her month-old website, a translation of a hugely successful US site, has stormed into the British market. </p> <p>A closer study of American statistics reveals that 60%of American women go online everyday. This research, carried out by the Pew Foundation, a charitable trust looking at the sociological impact of the net, found that US women favoured sites where they can shop, chat, download music or get health or career advice. They also discovered that over half of the group was logging on from home. Could this be the key to the explosion in female web use? Because, in the US, high-speed access is very often unmetered and usually free. Can we really expect the US experience to be replicated in Britain any time soon when, unlike Americans, most of us still have to pay BT for our home internet access? </p> <p>What we certainly can expect is that a large number of multinationals will take the US experience as gospel and forge into the British market, hoping to tap into the incredibly lucrative market segment that is the female consumer. </p> <p>Current British figures show that 36.6% of the 10m people online are women. They are ordering their groceries, making Tesco the biggest success story in e-commerce history; they are checking out their healthcare facilities through sites such as Wellbeing, an alliance between Boots and Granada; they are buying exclusive fashion through sites like Net-a-porter; they can even check up on the latest celebrity gossip. </p> <p>Jane Procter of Peoplenews.com has established that the majority of her users are women who are logging on from their offices. </p> <p>\"It is evident by the surge of user numbers at certain times of day that most are in an office. There is a huge push when people arrive at work and pick up their emails -then at lunchtime when they want something to read while they eat their sandwiches, and then again just before they leave. Our figures were 250,000 last month which is 30,000 higher than was projected - and we believe 60% are women.' </p> <p>While the figures concerning women at work are very promising, by comparison, only a small minority are logging on from home. </p> <p>Chad Wollen from consumer behaviour consultants, the Henley Centre, agrees that women in the home, most often mothers, are yet to be won over. \"Everything about the internet is unbelievably fast,\" he says, \"except the take-up by mums - which is unbelievably slow.\" </p> <p>But why is this fact so unbelievable, given that many mother's experiences of the web are so often bad. </p> <p>Take Jill. Jill is a freelance health journalist who should be swanning round the web picking up the most up-to-the-minute research. But what happens. </p> <p>\"I spend the half hour I have, before picking up my kids from school, hunting down Dr So-and-so from some university or other who appears to have done a study which is right up my street. And then I discover that the site hasn't been updated for three years and that Dr So-and-so moved on months ago. I can't afford to rely on information that can't be verified. I tend only to believe some thing now if it is between the covers of a book.\" </p> <p>And then take Rebecca. Now admittedly she still hasn't managed to get her head around email - but taking my suggestion to order a book on line, Rebecca spent two-and-a-half hours trying to track it down while her two-year-old twins had a fight on the living room floor. Eventually she gave up and found it at her local bookshop, which took her 20 minutes door to door and got the children out of the house. </p> <p> And finally, Liz, who is sick of her weekly shop in Tesco but is internet phobic. \"You have to shop online,\" I insisted. \"It's so simple - especially after you have done it once.\" </p> <p>Liz stumbled at the first hurdle. She tried to order baked beans and was then offered too many choices of size, multipack, brand, etc that she gave up. Now she's even more phobic. </p> <p>These women aren't stupid. Neither are they technologically incompetent. The Henley Centre has made significant findings in their research into this area. </p> <p>\"There are currently 4m mums online which is up 20% in the last six months,\" says Wollen. \"But only half of them use it every week. This betrays a complete lack of engagement. The internet has not become important to their everyday lives.\" </p> <p>There are many theories on why this is the case; that the PC is not accessible enough, hidden away as it often is, in a room at the back of the house; that the mum doesn't feel \"techie\" enough, particularly in comparison to her husband and offspring; that women don't trust the internet, particularly in terms of credit card security, junk email and viruses.

      "bodyText": "The bloke who used to be head of IT at my old office, Pete, had a very clear idea of why he spent so much of his time trying to undo the crashes that I, or other \"laydeez\" had caused by trying to log on. \"They just ain't compatible, girls and computers,\" he used to whine, as he thundered across my keyboard for the fifth time in a week. \"Women just don't have the right sort of brains.\" The latest research studies in the US, however, show that there is now \"gender parity\" in internet use and at first glance, these statistics suggest that, far from being web illiterate, women are (surprise, surprise) just as competent as men. At a recent conference organised by Marketing Week, entitled Women on the Web - reaching beyond gender stereotypes online - Philip Bird from Microsoft's MSN, gave these new statistics further relevance. \"What is happening with the net in the US today,\" he stated unequivocally, \"will happen here 14 months later. In the UK at present there is still a male bias - but I expect it to be a 50:50 ratio very soon.\" (Cue a mass pinging of braces across adland) Such conviction (or is it merely optimism?) was echoed by other speakers at the event - to the glee of the gathered managing directors and brand managers. According to Hilary Groves of iVillage UK, \"Women are one of the fastest growing internet segments\". Her arrival in Britain is testament to her company's confidence. Her month-old website, a translation of a hugely successful US site, has stormed into the British market. A closer study of American statistics reveals that 60%of American women go online everyday. This research, carried out by the Pew Foundation, a charitable trust looking at the sociological impact of the net, found that US women favoured sites where they can shop, chat, download music or get health or career advice. They also discovered that over half of the group was logging on from home. Could this be the key to the explosion in female web use? Because, in the US, high-speed access is very often unmetered and usually free. Can we really expect the US experience to be replicated in Britain any time soon when, unlike Americans, most of us still have to pay BT for our home internet access? What we certainly can expect is that a large number of multinationals will take the US experience as gospel and forge into the British market, hoping to tap into the incredibly lucrative market segment that is the female consumer. Current British figures show that 36.6% of the 10m people online are women. They are ordering their groceries, making Tesco the biggest success story in e-commerce history; they are checking out their healthcare facilities through sites such as Wellbeing, an alliance between Boots and Granada; they are buying exclusive fashion through sites like Net-a-porter; they can even check up on the latest celebrity gossip. Jane Procter of Peoplenews.com has established that the majority of her users are women who are logging on from their offices. \"It is evident by the surge of user numbers at certain times of day that most are in an office. There is a huge push when people arrive at work and pick up their emails -then at lunchtime when they want something to read while they eat their sandwiches, and then again just before they leave. Our figures were 250,000 last month which is 30,000 higher than was projected - and we believe 60% are women.' While the figures concerning women at work are very promising, by comparison, only a small minority are logging on from home. Chad Wollen from consumer behaviour consultants, the Henley Centre, agrees that women in the home, most often mothers, are yet to be won over. \"Everything about the internet is unbelievably fast,\" he says, \"except the take-up by mums - which is unbelievably slow.\" But why is this fact so unbelievable, given that many mother's experiences of the web are so often bad. Take Jill. Jill is a freelance health journalist who should be swanning round the web picking up the most up-to-the-minute research. But what happens. \"I spend the half hour I have, before picking up my kids from school, hunting down Dr So-and-so from some university or other who appears to have done a study which is right up my street. And then I discover that the site hasn't been updated for three years and that Dr So-and-so moved on months ago. I can't afford to rely on information that can't be verified. I tend only to believe some thing now if it is between the covers of a book.\" And then take Rebecca. Now admittedly she still hasn't managed to get her head around email - but taking my suggestion to order a book on line, Rebecca spent two-and-a-half hours trying to track it down while her two-year-old twins had a fight on the living room floor. Eventually she gave up and found it at her local bookshop, which took her 20 minutes door to door and got the children out of the house. And finally, Liz, who is sick of her weekly shop in Tesco but is internet phobic. \"You have to shop online,\" I insisted. \"It's so simple - especially after you have done it once.\" Liz stumbled at the first hurdle. She tried to order baked beans and was then offered too many choices of size, multipack, brand, etc that she gave up. Now she's even more phobic. These women aren't stupid. Neither are they technologically incompetent. The Henley Centre has made significant findings in their research into this area. \"There are currently 4m mums online which is up 20% in the last six months,\" says Wollen. \"But only half of them use it every week. This betrays a complete lack of engagement. The internet has not become important to their everyday lives.\" There are many theories on why this is the case; that the PC is not accessible enough, hidden away as it often is, in a room at the back of the house; that the mum doesn't feel \"techie\" enough, particularly in comparison to her husband and offspring; that women don't trust the internet, particularly in terms of credit card security, junk email and viruses. But the most significant finding concerns time management. \"Women are not adventurous,\" continues Wollen. \"They are task driven which means they get impatient. Working mothers, in particular, are so tired and exhausted by looking after their jobs, their kids and their homes that the internet becomes yet another responsibility which ends up being the straw that broke the camel's back.\" With, on average, 15 hours less free time per week than their male counterparts, women simply don't have the time to boot up, download or surf. How deliciously ironic that something as archaic as the unequal division of household chores should be standing in the way of women embracing future technology and therefore multinationals embracing women. Sam Phillips believes that lack of time has led men and women to differ on the fundamental point of the web - with men thinking of it as recreational and women seeing it as functional. \"From the figures I've seen - it seems true that some women don't relax with their PCs. If they don't quickly and easily find what they want, they won't surf the net like a man would - they just find it offline.\" Women in offices, on the other hand, are becoming more and more web literate, treating it as yet another part of their media diet.

      "bodyText": "Blast off The Nobel Prize is 100 years old this year, and although the awards will not be announced until December, celebrations are already under way (see www.nobel.se/nobel/events/schedule ). A centennial exhibition opened this month in Stockholm, and, in the US, the Smithsonian Institution is holding a Nobel Week of exhibitions and lectures starting on April 21. The SI's Lemelson Centre has also opened a populist website, Innovative Lives ( www.si.edu/lemelson/centerpieces/ilives ) to tell the stories behind a number of inventions from Kevlar to windsurfing. Bitstreams Another great museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art, has produced Bitstreams, an exhibition of digital art (see www.whitney.org/bitstreams). It does require non-trivial resources including Macromedia Flash 4, RealPlayer G2 and the Adobe Acrobat (PDF) plug in. However, some of the works are worth the effort, though the site runs with glacial slowness even on a broadband DSL line. New views The desktop is dead, according to David Gelernter, Yale academic, Unabomber victim, and author of the influential Mirror Worlds. The book spawned a company, also called Mirror Worlds, which has developed Scopewear: software that lets you organise your information by time (see www.scopeware.com/products/products_whatis.htm ). Although it offers many different views, the basic idea is of an expandable sequence of index cards. The good news is that a single-user personal version of the software is expected this summer. However, if you want to try a new way to find your data now, try Enfish. Red hot Over the past year, since the department of justice won its anti-trust case against Microsoft, the Nasdaq exchange has become best known as the home of plunging tech stocks. What better time to offer a real-time pictorial representation of the board, with green showing price rises and red showing falls? The idea is to help you spot trends. The \"heatmap\" of the top 100 stocks is at http://screening.nasdaq.com/ heatmaps/heatmap_100.asp. Web stacks The British Library's curators and bibliographers have been developing pages of resources covering the humanities, sound and music, rare books, and science and technology. The resources include a virtual reference library or index of external links. It isn't Yahoo, but it provides a good way in to the BL and related topics. Unloaded Ammo City has been launched with a range of promotions designed to attract 18 to 24-year-old members of \"youth culture\". They include painting graffiti at secret locations, club nights with notable DJs, Ammo City road signs, and hitchhikers (actually, drama students and actors from the Wide Theatre Group) with Ammo City scribbled on bits of card. Parental discretion is advised: the latest efforts at www. ammocity.com include an emailable clip from \"Add N to X's latest experimental/ pornographic music video\". The site's awful design is all part of manufacturing a \"lifestyle brand\". Pop game Robbie Williams has launched a platform game to help promote his latest single, Let Love Be Your Energy. You can either download it or play it online. The aim is to pick up as many girls as possible. This exercise in animated ecstasy can be found at www.robbiewilliams.com. Ice time The Stanley Cup play-offs are one of the sporting highlights of the year, as North America's professional ice hockey teams fight their way through best-of-seven series to the ultimate team prize. Although the play-offs are now covered in depth on Channel 5, you can also follow events on the web. And this year, the NHL and Virage are publishing highlights and a searchable video database at NHL.com. Chain cutter The tens of millions of newbies coming on to the internet each year are sometimes deceived by the hundreds of chain letters circulated by email. Many contain truthful information but most are junk. The Breaking the Chain is a good place to check their contents, and provides a useful companion to Snopes, the Urban Legends Reference Pages.

      "bodyText": "Two bombs in Karachi killed one person and injured two others yesterday during a widespread strike in protest against water shortages caused by the unrelenting drought in Pakistan. Paramilitary police were patrolling the city and most schools and businesses were closed after 230 people were arrested during a night of violence in which dozens of cars were set on fire. On Monday, the police used teargas and batons to stop 4,000 people protesting at the water shortage, in defiance of the military regime, which banned political rallies early last year. It was the biggest demonstration since the coup which brought the military to power. Political parties in Sind have long complained that water supplies are being held back upstream by Punjabis. The Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), the biggest political party in Karachi, and a smaller group, the Jiye Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (JSQM), called the strike but denied being involved in the bombing. \"We have called a peaceful strike and all business groups in the city have supported us,\" said Nasreen Jalil, an MQM leader and a member of the suspended senate. \"Our demonstrations will continue until the issue is resolved, because Sind is not getting the water it needs.\" The MQM represents Muslims who migrated to Pakistan from India during partition in 1947; the JSQM wants Sind to be a separate state. For a decade Karachi, the provincial capital, has been torn apart by bombings and street battles between factions of these groups and the police and army. After the army coup, things were quiet for a while, but this year the violence is back. The Pakistani finance minister, Shaukat Aziz, said the regime expected the drought would cost at least $2bn (\u00a31.4bn) in lost production and the cost of importing oil to replace water in electricity generation. Economists believe that at least a third of the wheat crop has already been destroyed. The official prediction for this year's economic growth rate has been cut to 3.5%, and many analysts think it will be lower. After four years of poor rainfall, the drought is expected to be one of the worst for decades. In neighbouring Afghanistan 500,000 people have been forced to leave their homes in search of food and water. The Pakistani regime has asked the meteorological of fice to examine the feasibility of melting the glaciers of the Hindu Kush and the Himalayas. If charcoal were sprayed on them, the theory goes, the black surface would absorb more sunshine and possibly increase the annual melt by up to 15%. But this could destabilise glaciers, block rivers and lead to flooding, according to the director general of the meteorological office, Qamar-uz-Zaman Chaudhry. \"So right now it is premature to say anything final on this subject,\" he said yesterday. Meanwhile, cloud seeding has already begun to try to produce rain.",

Of the total, \u00a3100m is being spent on a road tunnel linking Heathrow's central area to the western side of the airport, where T5 is to be built. It has been under construction for several months. The government has been sitting on the T5 report after receiving it at the end of last year following one of Britain's longest running planning inquiries. The government has approved the terminal but has delayed the announcement until after the election because of the politically sensitive nature of the report and the impact it could have on voters round Heathrow. The report has recommended that T5 goes ahead but with restrictions on night flying and passenger numbers. BAA said that planning permission for the new tunnel had been given regardless of T5.

Posing as drug traffickers buying arms for a Colombian paramilitary group, the film makers from El Mundo TV were taken round an air base at Banja Luka, in the Bosnian Serb Republic, and shown Gazelle helicopters for sale. The documentary, the second part of an investigation into arms smuggling from the Bosnian Serb Republic, was broadcast on Spain's Antena 3 channel last night. Reporters from El Mundo TV were taken into the UN-controlled air base by a Bosnian Serb officer who later negotiated the sale of two helicopters for $2m (\u00a31.4m) each. The documentary team was told by Veljko Borovina, the arms dealer who sent them to Banja Luka, that military instructors could be sent to Colombia to provide \"technical backup\". Mr Borovin, who is wanted by Bosnian Serb authorities in connection with the murder of a police officer, said police in the Bosnian Serb Republic would not stop any arms deals. \"They do what we say.

Major Obrenovic, who was charged on five counts of complicity in genocide, also denied violating the rules of war. The charge sheet said that, between July 1995 and November 1995, he \"participated in a criminal plan and enterprise, the common purpose of which was to detain, capture, and summarily execute by firing squad and bury over 5,000 Muslim men and boys from the Srebrenica enclave, including the exhumation of the victims' bodies and reburial in hidden locations\". Maj Obrenovic was arrested by plain-clothed officers of the S-For peacekeeping force in Zvornik, eastern Bosnia, early on Sunday, and transferred to the Hague. Prosecutors will be hoping that he can shed light on another trial slowly drawing to a conclusion at the tribunal, that of General Radislav Krstic, the former commander of the Drina Corps of the Bosnian Serb army. The Srebrenica massacre is widely recognised as the worst atrocity in Europe since the second world war. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, 7,300 men and boys, the youngest only 13, were massacred when the Bosnian Serb army overran Srebrenica on July 11 1995. The town had been declared a UN-protected \"safe haven\". Relatives of the missing estimate the death toll to be closer to 10,000. By September last year 4,000 bodies had been exhumed from mass graves around the town, but only 76 had been identified with any certainty. Thousands of women expelled from Srebrenica when the men were taken away are still without final confirmation that their missing male relatives are dead. Last November, during the trial of Gen Krstic, the prosecution played a tape supplied by Bosnian army intelligence which was allegedly the recording of an intercepted conversation between Gen Krstic and Maj Obrenovic. Made on August 2 1995, it appears to refer to what action should be taken against Bosn ian men who fled the massacre and were caught in the hills around Srebrenica. Krstic: Are you working down there? Obrenovic: We are working, indeed. K: Good. O: There are still a few, [they] got snared ... K: Yeah. O: ... either by guns or mines. K: Kill all in turn. Fuck their mothers! O: Everything is going according to plan. K: Don't leave a single one alive! O: What? K: Do not leave anyone alive! O: Everything is going according to plan. Everything. Gen Krstic has denied the authenticity of the tape, and accused the overall commander of the Bosnian Serb army, General Ratko Mladic, of responsibility for the massacre. Disappeared Gen Mladic lived openly until six weeks ago in his son's villa in a smart residential suburb of Belgrade. He then disappeared, apparently fearing arrest by the new Yugoslav authorities. He is now believed to be in hiding in Bosnia. The arrest of Maj Obrenovic, on a sealed (secret) warrant, has provoked an angry reaction by Serbs in Bosnia, including two days of anti-Nato demonstrations in Banja Luka and Zvornik. Mirko Sarovic, the president of Republika Srpska - the Serb republic in Bosnia - described the arrest, and the way it was carried out, as \"shameful\". Rebuke The authorities of the Bosnian Serb republic have promised to cooperate with the tribunal, but have yet to arrest a single war crimes suspect living on their territory. And yesterday the senior international representative in Bosnia, Wolfgang Petritsch, issued a sharp rebuke. \"Instead of complaining about sealed indictments and unexpected arrests, Mr Sarovic should use his influence to ensure that the Republika Srpska authorities arrest the 15 publicly indicted war criminals and transfer them to the Hague,\" Mr Petritsch's spokesman, Oleg Milisic, told reporters.

      "body": "<p>The spin doctors have been hired, lobbyists put on the payroll and giant posters of his face plastered across billboards to rally support and remind people why they voted for him in the first place. Transport and law and order are among his key policies, including a significant increase in police numbers and possibly the return of a school-based police cadet force. He preaches the value of working with business leaders and pursues \"big tent\" politics, discarding old left-right divides to seek consensus where possible.</p> <p>The best of the private sector, on salaries the public sector can barely afford, have been hired to inject expertise and dynamism into ailing bodies while a prominent union leader was urged to call off a strike to avoid inconveniencing the public. He bows his head at meetings of the Queen and enjoyed cracking a joke with the Queen Mother. And yesterday, after a meeting with senior police officers, he rallied behind the boys and girls in blue and issued a strong condemnation of the planned May Day protests in London. All very New Labour.</p> <p>Ken Livingstone is the dog that did not bite, barely barking during his first year as mayor of London. Even the tabloids rarely call him \"Red Ken\" these days. The Mr Livingstone currently presiding in the Greater London Authority's Romney House HQ is a very different beast to the Mr Livingstone of the Greater London Council and County Hall fame.</p> <p>Perhaps power has brought its own responsibility, leaving Livingstone a prisoner of a political system that has prevented him making much difference to the lives of Londoners, squeezed by the Treasury and Whitehall from above while below the borough councils jealously defend their turf. The approach of the first anniversary of Livingstone's election on May 4 risks leaving Tony Blair's warning that a Livingstone victory would spell \"disaster for London\" sounding increasingly hysterical. Trafalgar Square's last licensed seller of pigeon seed has gone and Major General Sir Henry Havelock and General Sir Charles Napier are threatened with expulsion, but the removal from a piazza of birds and a couple of statues is hardly a record to crow about.</p> <p>Livingstone has made most running on London Underground, opposing (with public support) John Prescott's plans to part-privatise the network in favour of a modernisation scheme that would use private funds to modernise a publicly owned network. Yet even here Livingstone has shown signs of New Labour largesse, appointing as transport commissioner Bob Kiley, a former senior CIA officer before he ran the New York subway, paying his recruit up to \u00a3500,000 a year and buying him a \u00a32.1m house .</p> <p>The mayor appeared to veer left by publicly refusing to condemn tube strikers earlier this year and proclaiming he might even join them on the picket line, but officials in the Aslef drivers' union report he was privately urging its general secretary to call off the stoppage.</p> <p>The stand-off over the tube is the one area where there is real conflict with the government, Livingstone yesterday announcing another advertising campaign to highlight safety fears ahead of his threatened legal challenge. But privately Livingstone has disclosed that he is keen to compromise and anxious to avoid a showdown, telling a meeting with MPs in Labour's leftwing campaign group last month that a resolution would be the best solution. The mayor, who conceded that his lawyers had warned he could lose any court action, told the surprised MPs he had spoken to Blair's Downing Street \"gatekeeper\" Anji Hunter and held discussions with Prescott.</p> <p>Yesterday's denunciation of May 1's monopoly board protesters, threatening to wreck shops and offices of the streets on capitalism's most famous board game, is also a change of tack in office. Livingstone was accused last year of encouraging riots. Mr Livingstone rejected the allegations and later branded the demonstra tors as \"mindless thugs\". In office, however, his uncompromising position - endorsing the police's \"zero tolerance\" response and urging protesters to stay away - was unequivocal. Then there are the speeches in the City, praising the value of the financial institutions to the capital, and arguing forcefully that Britain must join the single currency. And eyebrows were raised when Lord Rogers was appointed at \u00a31,625 a day to advise on architectural matters.</p> <p>The billboards of Livingstone peering at voters were devised under a \u00a320m two-year campaign to win public support for congestion charges. With New Labour, lobbyists are never far away. Livingstone is paying Fishburn Hedges an estimated \u00a3100,000 a month for advice.</p> <p>At the Westminster meeting with his old campaign group comrades, at least one disgruntled leftwing MP suggested that Livingstone was seeking an accommodation rather than confrontation with the government in the hope that a new-found respectability would pave the way for his return to the Labour party. Not so, said the mayor. That was up to Blair. For him, the priority was a second term as mayor.

      "bodyText": "The spin doctors have been hired, lobbyists put on the payroll and giant posters of his face plastered across billboards to rally support and remind people why they voted for him in the first place. Transport and law and order are among his key policies, including a significant increase in police numbers and possibly the return of a school-based police cadet force. He preaches the value of working with business leaders and pursues \"big tent\" politics, discarding old left-right divides to seek consensus where possible. The best of the private sector, on salaries the public sector can barely afford, have been hired to inject expertise and dynamism into ailing bodies while a prominent union leader was urged to call off a strike to avoid inconveniencing the public. He bows his head at meetings of the Queen and enjoyed cracking a joke with the Queen Mother. And yesterday, after a meeting with senior police officers, he rallied behind the boys and girls in blue and issued a strong condemnation of the planned May Day protests in London. All very New Labour. Ken Livingstone is the dog that did not bite, barely barking during his first year as mayor of London. Even the tabloids rarely call him \"Red Ken\" these days. The Mr Livingstone currently presiding in the Greater London Authority's Romney House HQ is a very different beast to the Mr Livingstone of the Greater London Council and County Hall fame. Perhaps power has brought its own responsibility, leaving Livingstone a prisoner of a political system that has prevented him making much difference to the lives of Londoners, squeezed by the Treasury and Whitehall from above while below the borough councils jealously defend their turf. The approach of the first anniversary of Livingstone's election on May 4 risks leaving Tony Blair's warning that a Livingstone victory would spell \"disaster for London\" sounding increasingly hysterical. Trafalgar Square's last licensed seller of pigeon seed has gone and Major General Sir Henry Havelock and General Sir Charles Napier are threatened with expulsion, but the removal from a piazza of birds and a couple of statues is hardly a record to crow about. Livingstone has made most running on London Underground, opposing (with public support) John Prescott's plans to part-privatise the network in favour of a modernisation scheme that would use private funds to modernise a publicly owned network. Yet even here Livingstone has shown signs of New Labour largesse, appointing as transport commissioner Bob Kiley, a former senior CIA officer before he ran the New York subway, paying his recruit up to \u00a3500,000 a year and buying him a \u00a32.1m house . The mayor appeared to veer left by publicly refusing to condemn tube strikers earlier this year and proclaiming he might even join them on the picket line, but officials in the Aslef drivers' union report he was privately urging its general secretary to call off the stoppage. The stand-off over the tube is the one area where there is real conflict with the government, Livingstone yesterday announcing another advertising campaign to highlight safety fears ahead of his threatened legal challenge. But privately Livingstone has disclosed that he is keen to compromise and anxious to avoid a showdown, telling a meeting with MPs in Labour's leftwing campaign group last month that a resolution would be the best solution. The mayor, who conceded that his lawyers had warned he could lose any court action, told the surprised MPs he had spoken to Blair's Downing Street \"gatekeeper\" Anji Hunter and held discussions with Prescott. Yesterday's denunciation of May 1's monopoly board protesters, threatening to wreck shops and offices of the streets on capitalism's most famous board game, is also a change of tack in office. Livingstone was accused last year of encouraging riots. Mr Livingstone rejected the allegations and later branded the demonstra tors as \"mindless thugs\". In office, however, his uncompromising position - endorsing the police's \"zero tolerance\" response and urging protesters to stay away - was unequivocal. Then there are the speeches in the City, praising the value of the financial institutions to the capital, and arguing forcefully that Britain must join the single currency. And eyebrows were raised when Lord Rogers was appointed at \u00a31,625 a day to advise on architectural matters. The billboards of Livingstone peering at voters were devised under a \u00a320m two-year campaign to win public support for congestion charges. With New Labour, lobbyists are never far away. Livingstone is paying Fishburn Hedges an estimated \u00a3100,000 a month for advice. At the Westminster meeting with his old campaign group comrades, at least one disgruntled leftwing MP suggested that Livingstone was seeking an accommodation rather than confrontation with the government in the hope that a new-found respectability would pave the way for his return to the Labour party. Not so, said the mayor. That was up to Blair. For him, the priority was a second term as mayor. Whether it was as an independent or Labour candidate mattered less. His performance so far, however, supporting the police and promoting business, is hardly likely to harm the prospect of an invitation. To some Livingstone will have been a disappointment; to others a relief. Livingstone used to boast that he was a parent of New Labour, pioneering modern campaign techniques such as posters and concerts in his battle with Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s over abolition of the GLC. Others on the Labour left claim he was always New Labour in methods if not policies - singlemindedly promoting the Livingstone brand above the party, continually seeking alliances to advance himself and, according to former allies, prepared to dump supporters who have outlived their usefulness. In many respects Blair failed to appreciate that Livingstone the politician, like himself, above all else would want to be re-elected. Derision has been repeatedly heaped on Blair for using public funds to produce an annual report applauding the government's efforts and lauding its achievements. Livingstone is now proposing to send out his own glossy document to London's 2.75m homes this summer, detailing his achievements during his first year in office. The mayor is legally obliged to distribute a performance report so critics, particularly those inside the Labour party, quip that he should send out postcards. But Livingstone favours a \u00a3940,000 version including an interview of the mayor by actress Helen Mirren with his comments interspaced with pictures of Ali G and Jack Dee, who will declare why they love London.

      "body": "<p>The Tory party has a leader, but it's out of his control. Six weeks short of an election, it can be seen careering into the far blue yonder. This is what desperation does to a party at all levels. The members are starting to say and do what they please. The Dagenham leaflet, charging the government with \"importing foreign nurses with HIV\", may be the first of many. We know that, because the party chairman, Michael Ancram, fears as much. He felt it necessary to send a memo cautioning every Conservative candidate against the use of \"language likely to generate racial or religious hatred\". An extraordinary thing for a British party boss to have to say. He seemed to understand what was coming.</p> <p>It began, sure enough, with William Hague. Hague's Harrogate philippic against the foreign land that Britain had become excited his extremists. They saw their prejudices legitimised. He gave them a green light. But now he can't hold them back. They do not respect him. Crazed by the certainty of defeat, more Tories will start to believe that they can say anything. There are people like them at party headquarters. There the attack dogs want no truck with the manifesto that Hague has apparently tried to write, and look instead for wheezes to fire up xenophobia, especially against asylum seekers, or tickle the loathing their people have for Tony Blair. This is a party for which the medicinal balm of Lady Thatcher, now summoned to the bedside, seems unlikely to be the right prescription.</p> <p>Rumours of a post-election alliance between Michael Portillo and Kenneth Clarke should be seen in this context. They did not need to be put about by the principals or close allies, and I do not think that they were. They're another product of the general desperation. Freed from the burden of victory, politicos think of little but the consequences of defeat. They always talk about it. We journalists collect it from the ether. A Portillo-Clarke alliance? Dream ticket back from the abyss! A link between the old left and old right. Could there be a heavier retort to the pipsqueak dogmatists about to lead the party to another huge defeat?</p> <p>Actually, the scenario makes no sense. It's hard to believe it will ever come to pass. If it did, it would not meet the case. It's the wrong answer to the wrong question.</p> <p>The deal, in theory, would be this. Portillo would contest the post-Hague leadership, strengthened by Clarke's support which had been bought with certain assurances, chief among them the promise that pro-euro Tories could campaign on that side of a referendum argument. There would be a new freedom of dissent, and Clarkeites would be able to exercise theirs from seats in the shadow cabinet. While retaining his hostility to the euro, Portillo would abandon the rest of the anti-EU baggage assembled by Hague, including the proposed referendum on the Nice treaty.</p> <p>This is the minimum Clarke could live with and, if it happened, might start British conservatism on the path to the real world. But who could rely on it being delivered? Any secret arrangement would be vulnerable to Portillo betraying it. Yet a public compact would not survive the meltdown fury of the majority in the party - and for a reason not entirely lacking in pragmatism. For the euro-referendum will constitute the one early hope the Tories have of restoring their electoral fortunes. Whoever is leading them will know that a No victory offers the best chance of transforming the power relationship between the parties in a 2005 election. If the party leadership can't unite around that proposition, the leader will have to argue, anyone who breaks ranks is declaring against conservatism's last best hope of gaining some purchase on 21st-century politics.</p> <p>Being sucked into that would surely not be attractive to the Tory left. Apart from giving too much credit to Portillo's own flexibility, it turns a blindly optimistic eye to the true state of anti-Europe feeling in the party. This has reached an extremity that any leader is likely to find irreversible for many years. Having surrendered all influence over the selection of parliamentary candidates, the left will find itself, whatever the scale of the election defeat, up against a wall of Europhobic MPs for whom every aspect of Europe has become a non-negotiable crusade.</p> <p>Two strategies, in particular, are gaining ground. The first is for rejection of a Yes result in the referendum, and an unending struggle to repudiate it right up to the moment when notes and coins are changed into euros. Since that moment is unlikely to be reached until after a further election, such a tactic has the power to continue dividing the party for years ahead, as well as compromising an optimal hand-over in the markets. Second, whether before or beyond the euro, Tory ultras are looking for two more referendums, through which to realign the entire British membership of the EU: one to fortify a radically separatist negotiating position, the other to approve what the negotiators come back with, thereby hoping to blackmail the continentals on the other side of the table.</p> <p>Such a ploy is transparent. Under cover of pseudo-moderation, it's the prelude to legitimising an exit from the EU if the British do not get what they want. That's what some in the shadow cabinet are secretly happy to contemplate. Such is the uncontrolled ferocity of opinion in the party - the righteous theological dogmatism into which a once rational political organisation has allowed itself to be seduced - that I would not risk a penny on the Tories, whoever is leading them, being able to compromise this extreme position before, or soon after, the euro referendum which Mr Blair is intending to hold.</p> <p>How far Michael Portillo would go along with that is hard to say. It wouldn't fit with the new trajectory that all his conscience-stricken posturing on social issues seems to imply. The strategy of inclusiveness, apparently shuddering with distaste at the coarse populism of Widdecombe -Hague, surely doesn't need to exclude those poor benighted fools who happen to believe in Britain-in-Europe, and also happen to include names that are still the ones that most people remember from a party they've otherwise screened out.

      "bodyText": "The Tory party has a leader, but it's out of his control. Six weeks short of an election, it can be seen careering into the far blue yonder. This is what desperation does to a party at all levels. The members are starting to say and do what they please. The Dagenham leaflet, charging the government with \"importing foreign nurses with HIV\", may be the first of many. We know that, because the party chairman, Michael Ancram, fears as much. He felt it necessary to send a memo cautioning every Conservative candidate against the use of \"language likely to generate racial or religious hatred\". An extraordinary thing for a British party boss to have to say. He seemed to understand what was coming. It began, sure enough, with William Hague. Hague's Harrogate philippic against the foreign land that Britain had become excited his extremists. They saw their prejudices legitimised. He gave them a green light. But now he can't hold them back. They do not respect him. Crazed by the certainty of defeat, more Tories will start to believe that they can say anything. There are people like them at party headquarters. There the attack dogs want no truck with the manifesto that Hague has apparently tried to write, and look instead for wheezes to fire up xenophobia, especially against asylum seekers, or tickle the loathing their people have for Tony Blair. This is a party for which the medicinal balm of Lady Thatcher, now summoned to the bedside, seems unlikely to be the right prescription. Rumours of a post-election alliance between Michael Portillo and Kenneth Clarke should be seen in this context. They did not need to be put about by the principals or close allies, and I do not think that they were. They're another product of the general desperation. Freed from the burden of victory, politicos think of little but the consequences of defeat. They always talk about it. We journalists collect it from the ether. A Portillo-Clarke alliance? Dream ticket back from the abyss! A link between the old left and old right. Could there be a heavier retort to the pipsqueak dogmatists about to lead the party to another huge defeat? Actually, the scenario makes no sense. It's hard to believe it will ever come to pass. If it did, it would not meet the case. It's the wrong answer to the wrong question. The deal, in theory, would be this. Portillo would contest the post-Hague leadership, strengthened by Clarke's support which had been bought with certain assurances, chief among them the promise that pro-euro Tories could campaign on that side of a referendum argument. There would be a new freedom of dissent, and Clarkeites would be able to exercise theirs from seats in the shadow cabinet. While retaining his hostility to the euro, Portillo would abandon the rest of the anti-EU baggage assembled by Hague, including the proposed referendum on the Nice treaty. This is the minimum Clarke could live with and, if it happened, might start British conservatism on the path to the real world. But who could rely on it being delivered? Any secret arrangement would be vulnerable to Portillo betraying it. Yet a public compact would not survive the meltdown fury of the majority in the party - and for a reason not entirely lacking in pragmatism. For the euro-referendum will constitute the one early hope the Tories have of restoring their electoral fortunes. Whoever is leading them will know that a No victory offers the best chance of transforming the power relationship between the parties in a 2005 election. If the party leadership can't unite around that proposition, the leader will have to argue, anyone who breaks ranks is declaring against conservatism's last best hope of gaining some purchase on 21st-century politics. Being sucked into that would surely not be attractive to the Tory left. Apart from giving too much credit to Portillo's own flexibility, it turns a blindly optimistic eye to the true state of anti-Europe feeling in the party. This has reached an extremity that any leader is likely to find irreversible for many years. Having surrendered all influence over the selection of parliamentary candidates, the left will find itself, whatever the scale of the election defeat, up against a wall of Europhobic MPs for whom every aspect of Europe has become a non-negotiable crusade. Two strategies, in particular, are gaining ground. The first is for rejection of a Yes result in the referendum, and an unending struggle to repudiate it right up to the moment when notes and coins are changed into euros. Since that moment is unlikely to be reached until after a further election, such a tactic has the power to continue dividing the party for years ahead, as well as compromising an optimal hand-over in the markets. Second, whether before or beyond the euro, Tory ultras are looking for two more referendums, through which to realign the entire British membership of the EU: one to fortify a radically separatist negotiating position, the other to approve what the negotiators come back with, thereby hoping to blackmail the continentals on the other side of the table. Such a ploy is transparent. Under cover of pseudo-moderation, it's the prelude to legitimising an exit from the EU if the British do not get what they want. That's what some in the shadow cabinet are secretly happy to contemplate. Such is the uncontrolled ferocity of opinion in the party - the righteous theological dogmatism into which a once rational political organisation has allowed itself to be seduced - that I would not risk a penny on the Tories, whoever is leading them, being able to compromise this extreme position before, or soon after, the euro referendum which Mr Blair is intending to hold. How far Michael Portillo would go along with that is hard to say. It wouldn't fit with the new trajectory that all his conscience-stricken posturing on social issues seems to imply. The strategy of inclusiveness, apparently shuddering with distaste at the coarse populism of Widdecombe -Hague, surely doesn't need to exclude those poor benighted fools who happen to believe in Britain-in-Europe, and also happen to include names that are still the ones that most people remember from a party they've otherwise screened out. On the other hand, Portillo seems to loathe the EU. He has already said the referendum will be illegitimate. He is obviously not to be trusted. The Tory left, therefore, have nothing to gain from dabbling with him. Far better to run their own candidate in a future contest, however quixotic the fight might be. They owe it to their conviction, and to backers who have not all faded away. They owe it to the case they're about to make, that Hague lost the 2001 election because his Euroscepticism helped ruin his credibility as a national leader. They also owe it to the referendum result they want. The plausible future that events should force upon them is not helping a party led by Michael Portillo, but leaving, and thus destroying, one led by Iain Duncan Smith. hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

With foot and mouth following BSE, meat-lovers need to be bold to indulge their passion. </p> <p>Gioma Restaurants, which owns the Gaucho Grill chain, has seen its shares fall 17% in recent weeks on food safety worries. This reaction looks a little hasty. </p> <p>The 36-strong Gaucho chain buys its beef from South America, so problems in British agriculture are irrelevant. There has been an outbreak of foot and mouth in Argentina but Gioma can use suppliers in Uruguay. </p> <p>Gaucho Grill restaurants have won fans for their succulent cuts and quirky atmosphere - with seats made from black and white cow hides. The average spend is about \u00a328 per head. </p> <p>Gioma floated in 1998 through a reverse takeover of Parambe, a quoted shell company. Its board includes fund manager Nicola Horlick, a friend of Gioma's Dutch chief executive, Zeev Godik. </p> <p>The chain has grown quickly. At the end of 1998, there were three sites trading, but in 1999 Gioma spent \u00a315m purchasing 23 restaurants in the Netherlands and Switzerland.

      "bodyText": "At first sight, steak restaurants appear about as lucrative as sun hats in Britain's current climate. With foot and mouth following BSE, meat-lovers need to be bold to indulge their passion. Gioma Restaurants, which owns the Gaucho Grill chain, has seen its shares fall 17% in recent weeks on food safety worries. This reaction looks a little hasty. The 36-strong Gaucho chain buys its beef from South America, so problems in British agriculture are irrelevant. There has been an outbreak of foot and mouth in Argentina but Gioma can use suppliers in Uruguay. Gaucho Grill restaurants have won fans for their succulent cuts and quirky atmosphere - with seats made from black and white cow hides. The average spend is about \u00a328 per head. Gioma floated in 1998 through a reverse takeover of Parambe, a quoted shell company. Its board includes fund manager Nicola Horlick, a friend of Gioma's Dutch chief executive, Zeev Godik. The chain has grown quickly. At the end of 1998, there were three sites trading, but in 1999 Gioma spent \u00a315m purchasing 23 restaurants in the Netherlands and Switzerland. By the end of 2002 it wants to have 60 outlets. Gioma has a second concept, Down Mexico Way, intended for big cities and offering late-night licences for drinks and dancing. Profits last year were \u00a32.6m, on sales of \u00a324.3m. Analyst Nigel Popham of Teather &amp; Greenwood expects these figures to rise to \u00a34m and \u00a343.7m in 2002. British outlets accounted for only 41% of turnover last year. The company raised \u00a37.2m to fund openings in November 1999 and it is unlikely to return to the market for more cash for two years. Spending on \"out of home\" eating is rising rapidly and Gioma occupies a decent niche in the smart-casual dining market. At 35p, the shares are on a modest multiple of 10 times expected earnings. A potentially appetising long-term punt.",

The macroeconomic news over the past couple of weeks has been moderately encouraging, implying that there may be a modest recovery in growth during the second half of the year.

This is hardly surprising, given that the expectations were utterly unrealistic in the first place, but even cheaper money will not be enough to deliver the sort of earnings that would justify the price put on US shares. </p> <p><strong> Bonus excess </strong><br> </p> <p>It can almost become a little wearing grinding on about executive excess.

Institutional investors are always quick to criticise such payments - along the lines of why directors deserve such payments when they have long-term incentives and share options which will pay out if the acquisitions prove successful - but they rarely have the required backbone to actually vote against them at annual general meetings. After all the kerfuffle of the Royal Bank bonuses, how much fuss was there at the AGM? None, aside from a couple of small shareholders. Abstaining in such votes is normally the most muscle they can muster. </p> <p>So it is worthy of a round of applause that, aside from family shareholders, 40% of Schroders' shareholders put a cross in the box to register their disapproval at the \u00a35m thank you payment awarded to Schroders' chairman Sir Win Bischoff for successfully managing to sell the investment bank to Citigroup. </p> <p>Never before have normally reticent institutional investors blown such a big raspberry at a company. </p> <p>But the fund managers' decision to choose Schroders to show their disapproval of the current big wad culture is a tad puzzling. It may have been an excessive payment - although Schroders insisted yesterday it was fully deserved and indeed could have been more - but at least this was a payment for achieving a sale, rather than an acquisition.

      "body": "<p>Winston Churchill was prime minister, presiding over a nation in mourning for King George VI, Cary Grant was filling cinemas with his performance in High Noon, while Gene Kelly was Singing in the Rain. </p> <p>The year was 1952 and the rationing of food introduced during the second world war was still in place as a young Gloucestershire lad, fresh from his local grammar school, started his first job. </p> <p>A keen trombonist and avid sportsman, the youthful Brian Pitman was joining Lloyds, the bank to which he devoted 49 years of uninterrupted service before retiring yesterday after 14 years as chief executive and four years as chairman. </p> <p>Times have changed. \"When I joined the bank, everything was handwritten, the ledgers, everything. Now it's done at the press of the button,\" he said yesterday as he presided over his last annual general meeting. </p> <p>Refusing to admit to any sense of nostalgia, Sir Brian - knighted in 1994 - said yesterday: \"I'm feeling great. I'm looking forward not back. I've had a great time. It's been a ball.\" </p> <p>To a certain extent it is hard to disagree with the 69 year old, whose accent still holds traces of his Gloucestershire roots. Something of the godfather of the banking industry, Sir Brian has steered Lloyds through an historic journey, enjoying enormous successes interspersed with embarrassing failures. </p> <p>Among the successes was getting out of investment banking before it came unfashionable and earning a reputation as deal doer. It was Sir Brian who snapped up Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the building society with its roots in his home region, before it was fashionable for building societies to give up their mutuality.

      "bodyText": "Winston Churchill was prime minister, presiding over a nation in mourning for King George VI, Cary Grant was filling cinemas with his performance in High Noon, while Gene Kelly was Singing in the Rain. The year was 1952 and the rationing of food introduced during the second world war was still in place as a young Gloucestershire lad, fresh from his local grammar school, started his first job. A keen trombonist and avid sportsman, the youthful Brian Pitman was joining Lloyds, the bank to which he devoted 49 years of uninterrupted service before retiring yesterday after 14 years as chief executive and four years as chairman. Times have changed. \"When I joined the bank, everything was handwritten, the ledgers, everything. Now it's done at the press of the button,\" he said yesterday as he presided over his last annual general meeting. Refusing to admit to any sense of nostalgia, Sir Brian - knighted in 1994 - said yesterday: \"I'm feeling great. I'm looking forward not back. I've had a great time. It's been a ball.\" To a certain extent it is hard to disagree with the 69 year old, whose accent still holds traces of his Gloucestershire roots. Something of the godfather of the banking industry, Sir Brian has steered Lloyds through an historic journey, enjoying enormous successes interspersed with embarrassing failures. Among the successes was getting out of investment banking before it came unfashionable and earning a reputation as deal doer. It was Sir Brian who snapped up Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the building society with its roots in his home region, before it was fashionable for building societies to give up their mutuality. He sealed the takeover of Trustee Saving Bank to create the current bank - Lloyds TSB. More recently, as chairman, he presided over the takeover of another mutual - Scottish Widows - although to a rather less rapturous applause than previously. Among the failures were the deals he missed, notably the takeover of Standard Chartered in 1986 and Midland in 1992. This was a legacy that had almost been forgotten by a newer generation in the City before being reawakened by the bank's current plight - the attempted takeover of Abbey National, currently in limbo because of a competition investigation. Even Sir Brian cannot escape the schadenfreude of some who have taken to pinning the blame for the bank's current predicament on his fight to cut costs during the 1990s - which earned the bank an almost iconoclastic status in the City - instead of investing for growth. This is why some City sources believe Lloyds TSB was left searching for another takeover target - in this case Abbey. With its ambitions to take over Abbey outside the bank's control, and a promised European tie-up still eluding the bank, Sir Brian repeats his mantra that mergers across the financial services industry are only a matter of time. \"Some business being put on [by our rivals] is not earning the cost of capital,\" he said. His one prediction for the future of banking is that customers will soon have to start paying for what they get. \"People often ask why people don't move their bank accounts. It's because bank accounts are free. You can't get a price lower than free. This means that in the future there'll be steady elimination of cross subsidisation where you get so much free,\" he said. Technology is the biggest single thing that has changed his half century at work. \"It revolutionised the way we can do business. \"It will go on being important. The challenge will be how to provide a personal service in a digital age - how do we get that individual services.

So I cast my eyes down like a true penitent and received a glancing blow from a passing scooter. At the Uffizi gallery, I intended to gaze for at least half an hour at the first picture I found of the crucifixion. After 45 minutes, I realised I was in the wrong queue. After another hour in the right queue, I was still miles from the front. </p> <p>I don't know about the suffering of Saint Sebastian, but I was having a pretty grim afternoon myself. A freezing wind was sweeping down through the Piazza Signoria, making the copy of Michelangelo's David look defiant but even more shrivelled than usual. The opera-singing busker was about to launch into the same aria from Rigoletto for about the 20th time, when I decided I'd had enough. I would get my crucifixion elsewhere. </p> <p>Oh no I wouldn't. The galleries were full and the churches closing. I bought a guide to the Uffizi but it had only one relevant reproduction - a work from the Tuscan school in the second half of the 12th century. You couldn't see any detail but Christ distinctly resembled David Seaman. I went back to my hotel and started drinking. Stendhal suffered from a surfeit of culture; I from a lack. It's hard work getting a crucifixion in Florence on Good Friday. I put my walking boots by the door.</p>",

So I cast my eyes down like a true penitent and received a glancing blow from a passing scooter. At the Uffizi gallery, I intended to gaze for at least half an hour at the first picture I found of the crucifixion. After 45 minutes, I realised I was in the wrong queue. After another hour in the right queue, I was still miles from the front. I don't know about the suffering of Saint Sebastian, but I was having a pretty grim afternoon myself. A freezing wind was sweeping down through the Piazza Signoria, making the copy of Michelangelo's David look defiant but even more shrivelled than usual. The opera-singing busker was about to launch into the same aria from Rigoletto for about the 20th time, when I decided I'd had enough. I would get my crucifixion elsewhere. Oh no I wouldn't. The galleries were full and the churches closing. I bought a guide to the Uffizi but it had only one relevant reproduction - a work from the Tuscan school in the second half of the 12th century. You couldn't see any detail but Christ distinctly resembled David Seaman. I went back to my hotel and started drinking. Stendhal suffered from a surfeit of culture; I from a lack. It's hard work getting a crucifixion in Florence on Good Friday. I put my walking boots by the door.",

      "body": "<p>Thirty-five years after its heyday, mod is making another comeback. Next Monday sees the release of a four-CD box set of 1960s classics, glossily packaged with a history of mod and claiming to represent \"the first ever style movement\". Close on its heels is another box set, this time of singles from mod icons the Jam. Terry Rawlings's lavishly illustrated book The Story of Mod has just gone into a second edition. Paolo Hewitt's The Soul Stylists, which features mods heavily, has been reprinted and the TV options sold. Sales of scooters are up more than 60% for the second year running, according to Piaggio, makers of the classic mod vehicle, the Vespa. Even Robbie Williams has been spotted in a parka. </p> <p>Mod happened not once, but at least twice: it peaked in the mid-1960s, then was revived in the late 1970s. And again in the mid-1990s, if you count Britpop heavyweights Blur and Oasis battling it out with Union flag imagery and Small Faces guitar riffs. But this time mod is being offered up for nostalgia, not revival: a wallow in the birth of British cool. </p> <p>Some say it never went away. Talvin Singh's east London \"Asian mods\" made an appearance in Hoxton in the late 1990s. Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels delved not just into the mod penchant for ska, old soul, long leather coats and crisp suits, but into its social framework of sharp-looking working-class lads on the make and on the move. </p> <p>\"This is the age of giving the old influences a new coat of paint,\" says cutting-edge DJ Gilles Peterson. \"There's something classic about mods that's far more relevant to now than other tribes. They were eclectic from the start.\" </p> <p>Mod is in many ways the blueprint for later British youth movements. Its look-good, stay-cool code has more lasting resonance than the situationist pranks of punk. And with the style cognoscenti in a state of confusion about the whereabouts of youth rebellion - the magazine Dazed &amp; Confused has even staged a debate on the issue - it's not surprising that people are looking back at it. </p> <p>Mod can be traced back to the late 1950s, when smart bohemians hung out in Soho jazz clubs and called themselves \"mod ernists\". \"Kind of intellectual types into smooth jazz,\" remembers Phil Smee, a veteran of the 1960s mod scene who designed The In Crowd's packaging. \"You needed a bit of money to belong to that set.\" </p> <p>But by the early 1960s there was money around. \"The only way you were out of work was if you couldn't be bothered to work. It was a real social stigma,\" remembers Richard Shirman, lead singer of mod group the Attack. \"There has never been a time like it for being a teenager. We were flexing our muscles in all sorts of ways.\" The development of discotheques meant it became cool to go out and listen to records. Early forms of ska seeped from London's Jamaican clubs to join fast American soul from labels such as Tamla Motown and homegrown, up-tempo \"pop art\" groups such as the Who and the Attack as the soundtrack to a fast-living, resolutely urban lifestyle. </p> <p>With the help of the mods' own TV show, Ready, Steady, Go! - slogan, \"The weekend starts here\" - everyone knew what was in. Smee remembers presenter Cathy McGowan changing the direction of the flicks in her hairstyle. \"Of course every girl in the country had to change her hair.\" </p> <p>Hair was pretty important, says Phil Smee: \"Members of the Action had hair that grew the right way. Woe betide anyone with curly hair.\" And while a hand-tailored suit was the ultimate mod outfit, Smee remembers a pivotal moment when one style guru turned up wearing a complete Chelsea pensioner uniform, to the awestruck envy of his friends. </p> <p>Richard Shirman was one of Ready, Steady, Go!'s dancers. As a Mick Jagger-lookalike and dude-around-town, he became a regular feature of the Melody Maker's The Raver column and was dubbed Jivin' K Boots. He compares mod's obsession with detail - such as shoes, or the huge functionless tank aerials that they fixed to their scooters - to the way teenagers obsess over trainers today. \"They were showing that they were worthwhile and to be reckoned with,\" he says. \"They were the ones who had the style.\" </p> <p>Those who followed mod's unwritten rules most closely were known as \"faces\" - a phrase that gave itself to style magazine the Face - and set standards of cool for bands ever since. Daddy G from Massive Attack, one of the UK's most influential bands of the past decade, describes growing up on Bristol's ultra-cool club scene in the 1980s: \"We were so obsessive, there was this thing about quality control with us. From the early days, you couldn't wear the wrong trainers or the wrong jeans. It was quite subtle, but it was of the utmost importance.\" </p> <p>It has even been argued that the entire history of popular culture since the 1960s can be divided between two schools of thought: mods versus the sloppier, scruffier, more easy-going hippies. According to this theory, punk was mod; acid house hippie. But come the mid-1990s, clubbers smartened up and became mod, while punk - a retro lifestyle choice for drop-outs - hippie. Sharply dressed Craig David is a mod; baggy old Starsailor hippies, and so on. </p> <p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s the mod revival threw up 2-Tone bands such as the Specials and Madness, as well as the Jam. Once again there were \"faces\", many of whom became movers in the 1980s acid-jazz movement, such as Mark Nelson of the Young Disciples and Eddie Pillar, who started the Acid Jazz label. And there were off-the-peg \"Millet mods\" with their reflex reliance on the mod imagery of scooters, targets and parkas. </p> <p>Photographer Dean Belcher was a \"face\" in Swindon at the time, where he sang in a mod group when not spending weekends clubbing in London and buying cloth to take back to Swindon to be tailored into suits. He worked in a plastics factory. \"It was about the clubs and being part of a gang,\" he says now. Years later, while photographing the drum'n'bass star Goldie in Los Angeles, Belcher found himself having dinner at the actor Larry Fishburne's house. Fishburne had been an LA mod in his youth and dinner was spent discussing scooters. Belcher can spot old mods a mile off. It's all in the details. </p> <p>The In Crowd's glossy booklet contains many photos of 1960s mods.

      "body": "<p>My first encounter with Jascha Heifetz must have come when I was about three years old. In Israel in the late 1940s there was a lot of classical music on the radio and I recall that they played a lot of his recordings. Later I realised that everything in the history of violin playing could be divided into BH and AH: Before Heifetz and After Heifetz. </p> <p>I first met him when I was a nervous 14-year-old. He'd come to the Juilliard School, New York to hear some of the violin pupils. I played him the Lalo Symphonie Espanol and a Paganini Caprice and then my teacher, Ivan Galamian, said I could go. But Heifetz said, \"Not so fast! I want to hear scales.\" Thankfully, my previous teacher in Israel had placed great importance on exercises, and I was well prepared - so when Heifetz told me the scale he wanted to hear, I could play it straight off. So our friendship started on the right foot. </p> <p>After that he attended a couple of my concerts, and we would meet each time I went to Los Angeles, his home town. Sometimes we'd talk on the phone - usually about everyday things, but occasionally he'd tell me about his life and career. In the middle of the conversation I would suddenly think, \"Gee! I'm talking to God!\" Violinists of my generation thought he was the king, and I was no exception. </p> <p>The last time I saw him in LA he was clearly ailing, and his death in 1987 was terribly upsetting personally, as well as a great loss to the musical world. We are lucky so many of his recordings have survived - there's so much material that his record company, RCA, was able to release a Heifetz Collection of 65 CDs in 1994. These are fascinating - they say a lot about the evolution of his style. If you listen to the earlier recordings, made I believe when he was 16 to 18, you don't hear the individual Heifetz we all know. Of course, you hear a fantastic fiddle player, but there's the audible influence of his contemporaries, of Fritz Kreisler and Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe. Then, slowly, you hear his own style emerge. </p> <p>There was nothing generic about his mature playing: he was one of a kind. Even listening to him on the radio as a child, I remember he was always a violinist one could immediately recognise. How you describe a performer's sound is a matter of semantics, but I always found his to be very intense, very fiery. And there was nothing apologetic about it - he demanded one should listen to him. In this way, he became the opposite of Kreisler, who would play as if saying, \"Here's a beautiful tune\", whereas Heifetz would demand, \"You! Listen to this!\" Today he is still the most distinctive violinist I can think of. </p> <p>The discs are amazing, but they don't tell the whole story. The violinist Nathan Milstein once advised me to \"forget the recordings - they are no comparison to hearing him live\". Imagine that! I was lucky enough to hear him play a couple of times when he made a comeback in his early 60s. Lots of people said he was a cold player because he was so motionless, but that couldn't be further from the truth. He looked cold, but he played hot. </p> <p>The goals he set still remain, and for violinists today it's rather depressing that they may never really be attained again. It's as if he broke the four-minute mile, and no one else has been able to come close. So many violinists have tried to imitate him, but their playing becomes a caricature. Early in my career I realised that many of my recordings so far had been of things I loved to hear Heifetz play, but as I play in an old-fashioned style anyway, and could never really divorce myself from the way I usually perform, I hope I avoided being a caricature. </p> <p>I've been doing tribute concerts to Heifetz for a couple of years now, but my programme at the Festival Hall next week will be the first in the UK. I've researched the programmes he gave in venues including Carnegie Hall. I'm very pleased to be playing the Sonata No 1 by Saint-Sa\u00ebns as it was a piece he really championed, especially towards the end of his career. I'll also be playing several of Heifetz's own arrangements. I often use these as encores - every violinist does, as his and Kreisler's transcriptions are still the major sources of light, virtuoso pieces. </p> <p>He was a wonderful pianist who really knew the instrument, and his harmonies are quite individual, with maybe a little taste of Rachmaninov. I love his Baroque pieces, his reworkings of Ravel and Debussy and also his transcriptions of Gershwin. They were quite revolutionary in their way - we didn't have the term crossover then, but they are definitely in that mould. Heifetz recorded a couple of Gershwin songs with Bing Crosby - he played in the best Hollywood tradition, sounding totally comfortable. </p> <p>I once had the pleasure of playing Heifetz's violin, a Guarneri del Jesu known as the \"Ex-David\". It's now in a small museum in San Francisco, but for a while it was displayed in the Met Museum, where I gave a recital. My ear was where his would have been, listening to the sound of his violin. </p> <p>But, in a way, that sound had always been in my head. I wouldn't say there are any parallels between our careers, and I certainly don't want to draw comparisons between our playing. But I grew up with certain sounds in my ears, and if there are similarities between my interpretations and his, it is not something I'm trying to do - it is something I feel. </p> <p>\u2022 Itzhak Perlman's centenary tribute to Heifetz is at the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 (020-7960 4242), on April 24.</p>",

Everything he said was completely true and reflected the intentions in the army, until the order came from the prime minister.\"</p> <p>The confusion of the last 24 hours has undermined Mr Sharon's repeated claims that he has a secret plan to end the Palestinian uprising and restore a sense of security to Israelis. He has emerged looking weak and confused.</p> <p>Instead of the promised security, the cycle of revenge that has ruled both peoples for seven months, and left more than 475 dead, mainly Palestinian, was renewed.</p> <p>Overnight Israeli tanks and bulldozers rolled back from northern Gaza, flattening hen coops and greenhouses, and uprooting orange and olive trees in the one corner of fertile land in the territory. By yesterday morning Palestinian militants were firing mortars at the Jewish settlement of Neve Dekalim on the southern coast.</p> <p>Then, in the afternoon, the bulldozers roared into Palestinian-controlled land once again.</p> <p>A police post was demol ished in a hail of machine gun and tank fire.</p> <p>It was the fourth invasion of Palestinian territory since Mr Sharon introduced these drastic tactics nine days ago, suggesting that he hopes to make such actions - which violate the Oslo peace accords - acceptable to Israeli and international opinion by making them routine.</p> <p>Amid this new destruction, Palestinians were savouring a rare moment of Israeli discomfiture, saying that Mr Sharon had committed a huge blunder by imagining that Washington would overlook a reoccupation in Gaza which would, in effect, demolish the last remains of the 1993 Oslo peace accords, which Washington sponsored.</p> <p>\"The tough US position forced the politically stupid Sharon to order his army to retreat with their heads in the ground,\" said a Palestinian negotiator, Hassan Asfour.</p> <p>But Israelis were more forgiving. Although Mr Sharon faced withering criticism from settlers, who said he had sold out to Washington, most Israelis were simply relieved that their soldier sons would not be bogged down in Gaza, as they were inthe 18-year occupation which followed the invasion of Lebanon orchestrated by Mr Sharon in 1982.</p> <p>\"We were very relieved that he pulled out,\" said Yael Dayan, a peace activist and Labour member of parliament, who is the daughter of the legendary General Moshe Dayan.</p> <p>\"At the time when we went in I was very worried because I thought, it's easy to come in, but what about coming out? Now I am still critical, but I am less extreme about it.\"</p> <p>Other commentators thought that Israelis had become numb to events in the West Bank and Gaza, and were deeply cynical about constant warnings that the conflict could get worse.</p> <p>\"He [Sharon] is our bully and he has to bully the Palestinians, and for most Israelis that is all the plan we need,\" said Avishai Margalit, a professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.</p> <p>\"They know it is a circle of violence that will go on and on.

Everything he said was completely true and reflected the intentions in the army, until the order came from the prime minister.\" The confusion of the last 24 hours has undermined Mr Sharon's repeated claims that he has a secret plan to end the Palestinian uprising and restore a sense of security to Israelis. He has emerged looking weak and confused. Instead of the promised security, the cycle of revenge that has ruled both peoples for seven months, and left more than 475 dead, mainly Palestinian, was renewed. Overnight Israeli tanks and bulldozers rolled back from northern Gaza, flattening hen coops and greenhouses, and uprooting orange and olive trees in the one corner of fertile land in the territory. By yesterday morning Palestinian militants were firing mortars at the Jewish settlement of Neve Dekalim on the southern coast. Then, in the afternoon, the bulldozers roared into Palestinian-controlled land once again. A police post was demol ished in a hail of machine gun and tank fire. It was the fourth invasion of Palestinian territory since Mr Sharon introduced these drastic tactics nine days ago, suggesting that he hopes to make such actions - which violate the Oslo peace accords - acceptable to Israeli and international opinion by making them routine. Amid this new destruction, Palestinians were savouring a rare moment of Israeli discomfiture, saying that Mr Sharon had committed a huge blunder by imagining that Washington would overlook a reoccupation in Gaza which would, in effect, demolish the last remains of the 1993 Oslo peace accords, which Washington sponsored. \"The tough US position forced the politically stupid Sharon to order his army to retreat with their heads in the ground,\" said a Palestinian negotiator, Hassan Asfour. But Israelis were more forgiving. Although Mr Sharon faced withering criticism from settlers, who said he had sold out to Washington, most Israelis were simply relieved that their soldier sons would not be bogged down in Gaza, as they were inthe 18-year occupation which followed the invasion of Lebanon orchestrated by Mr Sharon in 1982. \"We were very relieved that he pulled out,\" said Yael Dayan, a peace activist and Labour member of parliament, who is the daughter of the legendary General Moshe Dayan. \"At the time when we went in I was very worried because I thought, it's easy to come in, but what about coming out? Now I am still critical, but I am less extreme about it.\" Other commentators thought that Israelis had become numb to events in the West Bank and Gaza, and were deeply cynical about constant warnings that the conflict could get worse. \"He [Sharon] is our bully and he has to bully the Palestinians, and for most Israelis that is all the plan we need,\" said Avishai Margalit, a professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. \"They know it is a circle of violence that will go on and on. In retrospect this will be just another move that will be dwarfed by whatever happens in a month.\" Audio Suzanne Goldenberg in Jerusalem (3mins) Talk about it What do you think?

Software is like a story written in Albanian. And if I wrote stories in Albanian, I would like the right to protect them. That is not to say that everyone who read them would have to pay, but that if someone made a blockbuster Hollywood movie out of one of them, I would at least like my name on the credits. </p> <p>I take the trouble to stake that small claim in the context of Linux/GNU because my suspicions are aroused whenever big business announces its support for anything, as it has for Linux/GNU: I suspect the dollar signs are flickering before its corporate eyes. </p> <p>When the lawyer Justin Watts so angered Richard Stallman by suggesting patents for the free software movement's work, perhaps that was what he had in mind, particularly as we stand, gobsmacked, watching big business being allowed, effectively, patents on human beings, in the form of DNA sequences. I plan to consult Mr Watts about the possibility of patenting a system of blood oxygenation by muscle-powered thoracic intake and expulsion of air via the nasal and oral passages. <br> <strong> Martin Hillman</strong> <br> <a href=\"MAILTO:marthillman@yahoo.co.uk\">marthillman@yahoo.co.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> Digital delay</strong><br> Digital radio may or may not be \"on the move\" (Online April 12) but if the new generation of digital baseband chips and digital receiver modules are to make a difference, they will have to be produced in greater quantities than the industry has yet been able to manage. Over the last few months, one major retailer in central Manchester has managed to have two different varieties of digital audio broadcasting tuner more or less continuously on display, but while Classic FM continues to run promotional commercials for \"Digital radio - tomorrow's wireless!\" few specialist hi-fi retailers have the equipment available for purchase. There are two specialist retailers in central Manchester who only occasionally have DAB tuners and the best hi-fi outlet in Bolton simply can't get equipment from the manufacturers. Are there problems on the production side? I think we should be told. <strong> Peter Johnston</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:peter.johnston@bolton.gov.uk\">peter.johnston@bolton.gov.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> No substitute</strong><br> I feel I must comment on Andy Howell's letter regarding his experiences with Telewest's interactive TV. He says he is pleasantly surprised. I have NTL's digital TV system - it is appallingly slow and unreliable. And unless it is much improved, I cannot see myself being able, never mind willing to use it instead of a PC. <strong> Lee Yarkess</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:lee@brierfield.co.uk\">lee@brierfield.co.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> Poor service</strong><br> As a Telewest Active Digital subscriber for some time, I had to read Andy Howell's letter twice to make sure I hadn't dreamt what it said. </p> <p>Was the service I had tried and given up on really \"clearly reliable and useful\"? In case they had upgraded it in recent weeks, I tried it out again. </p> <p>No. It's still incredibly slow, with each \"page\" taking between 5 and 30 seconds to refresh. Many pages still fail to appear at all and the content is usually less useful than either teletext or the internet. </p> <p>For a while, Telewest had us in a stranglehold as, when they persuaded us to move from analogue to digital, they assured us that the suddenly absent teletext service for terrestrial channels would be restored \"very soon\". I think that the fact that these have only just reappeared is because their substitute Active Digital info pages still don't bear comparison for speed, reliability or usefulness. If it's just my region that is affected (the South West), I await a visit from a Telewest engineer with eager anticipation. <br> <strong> Colin Malsingh</strong> <br> Bristol </p> <p><strong> Sound tradeoff</strong><br> On page 5, April 12, Ashley Norris wrote: \"...digital tuner... with sound quality that is superior to FM transmissions..\" The alleged superiority of DAB over FM is highly debatable. But don't take my word, look at Hi-Fi News (May). Just one quote: \"Even more than CD, digital radio has a thin, cold character. The original studio-quality sound has been considerably reduced before transmission, to around the level of the MP3 music traded on the internet.\" </p> <p>The potential of the technology is being wasted to maximise use of the transmitting bandwith. As with CD, \"the perfect sound forever\" which only now is being finally improved, with super compact audio disc and DVD-Audio, commercial considerations will give us a poorer product than the existing analogue one. <br> <strong> Roger Perry</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:roger.perry@tesco.net\">roger.perry@tesco.net</a> </p> <p><strong> Radio request</strong><br> You report on the availability of new Digital Audio Broadcasting chips to fit handheld devices.

Software is like a story written in Albanian. And if I wrote stories in Albanian, I would like the right to protect them. That is not to say that everyone who read them would have to pay, but that if someone made a blockbuster Hollywood movie out of one of them, I would at least like my name on the credits. I take the trouble to stake that small claim in the context of Linux/GNU because my suspicions are aroused whenever big business announces its support for anything, as it has for Linux/GNU: I suspect the dollar signs are flickering before its corporate eyes. When the lawyer Justin Watts so angered Richard Stallman by suggesting patents for the free software movement's work, perhaps that was what he had in mind, particularly as we stand, gobsmacked, watching big business being allowed, effectively, patents on human beings, in the form of DNA sequences. I plan to consult Mr Watts about the possibility of patenting a system of blood oxygenation by muscle-powered thoracic intake and expulsion of air via the nasal and oral passages. Martin Hillman marthillman@yahoo.co.uk Digital delay Digital radio may or may not be \"on the move\" (Online April 12) but if the new generation of digital baseband chips and digital receiver modules are to make a difference, they will have to be produced in greater quantities than the industry has yet been able to manage. Over the last few months, one major retailer in central Manchester has managed to have two different varieties of digital audio broadcasting tuner more or less continuously on display, but while Classic FM continues to run promotional commercials for \"Digital radio - tomorrow's wireless!\" few specialist hi-fi retailers have the equipment available for purchase. There are two specialist retailers in central Manchester who only occasionally have DAB tuners and the best hi-fi outlet in Bolton simply can't get equipment from the manufacturers. Are there problems on the production side? I think we should be told. Peter Johnston peter.johnston@bolton.gov.uk No substitute I feel I must comment on Andy Howell's letter regarding his experiences with Telewest's interactive TV. He says he is pleasantly surprised. I have NTL's digital TV system - it is appallingly slow and unreliable. And unless it is much improved, I cannot see myself being able, never mind willing to use it instead of a PC. Lee Yarkess lee@brierfield.co.uk Poor service As a Telewest Active Digital subscriber for some time, I had to read Andy Howell's letter twice to make sure I hadn't dreamt what it said. Was the service I had tried and given up on really \"clearly reliable and useful\"? In case they had upgraded it in recent weeks, I tried it out again. No. It's still incredibly slow, with each \"page\" taking between 5 and 30 seconds to refresh. Many pages still fail to appear at all and the content is usually less useful than either teletext or the internet. For a while, Telewest had us in a stranglehold as, when they persuaded us to move from analogue to digital, they assured us that the suddenly absent teletext service for terrestrial channels would be restored \"very soon\". I think that the fact that these have only just reappeared is because their substitute Active Digital info pages still don't bear comparison for speed, reliability or usefulness. If it's just my region that is affected (the South West), I await a visit from a Telewest engineer with eager anticipation. Colin Malsingh Bristol Sound tradeoff On page 5, April 12, Ashley Norris wrote: \"...digital tuner... with sound quality that is superior to FM transmissions..\" The alleged superiority of DAB over FM is highly debatable. But don't take my word, look at Hi-Fi News (May). Just one quote: \"Even more than CD, digital radio has a thin, cold character. The original studio-quality sound has been considerably reduced before transmission, to around the level of the MP3 music traded on the internet.\" The potential of the technology is being wasted to maximise use of the transmitting bandwith. As with CD, \"the perfect sound forever\" which only now is being finally improved, with super compact audio disc and DVD-Audio, commercial considerations will give us a poorer product than the existing analogue one. Roger Perry roger.perry@tesco.net Radio request You report on the availability of new Digital Audio Broadcasting chips to fit handheld devices. Most of us waiting to switch to DAB radios would be happy for one of the long promised portable radios to appear. Michael Pritchard mpritchard@cix.co.uk",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Shadow of Memories</strong> </p> <p>Sony PlayStation 2 \u00a339.99 Konami ** <br> Poor Eike - he can't turn his back without someone sticking the knife (or dagger) in. Luckily, he has a digipad - a time-travelling gadget that lets him go back through the ages and prevent his recurring murder. </p> <p>Yes, for once we can forget about aliens, orcs and racing cars - Shadows of Memories is set in a German town full of ageing museum owners and shy waitresses. But it is not only the characterisation that is refreshing. SoM's time-travelling mystery premise is nothing if not original. </p> <p>For example, one level sees you transported back to the 16th century to prevent the planting of a tree that will be used as cover by your assailant 400 years later. Everything you do in the past has an impact on the future and some lateral thinking is required to succeed. </p> <p>However, keeping such a tangled plot together means there are a lot of cut-scenes, which while beautifully animated, don't involve interaction. You'll often feel like you are watching a film or reading a book - not exactly what you'd bought your PS2 for. </p> <p>Then there is the incredibly linear progression of the game. You are often told where to go to find the next clue (and cut-scene) and although your choices do influence the ending, the handholding quickly becomes irksome. </p> <p>Konami has described SoM as a digital novel, which isn't too far off the truth, and it is likely the title will appeal to the type of non-action games player who enjoyed Myst. </p> <p>An admirable attempt at offering something new, Shadow of Memories' narrative is engrossing, it is graphically impressive and genuinely different. What it isn't, alas, is much of a game. (GH)</p> <p> <strong> Unreal Tournament</strong> </p> <p> Sony PlayStation 2 \u00a339.99 Epic/Infogrames *** <br> The bloodthirst that made gladiatorial fights the sport of choice for ancient Romans hasn't abated, it has merely become digitised. </p> <p>In Unreal Tournament the gladiators chase each other around futuristic arenas, medieval castles suspended in space and dark coliseums of steel, with high-powered pistols, rocket launchers and laser rifles. </p> <p>And although their deaths often leave splashes of gore on the walls and chunks of flesh on the floor, they are instantaneously resurrected until a victor achieves a certain number of kills or frags. </p> <p>Like the faster Quake III and the more sophisticated Counter-Strike, Unreal Tournament was originally a huge PC success. On a computer you can take part in colossal battles with dozens of other players, as part of a team or in a vicious and relentless contest where everyone is your enemy. </p> <p>But the PlayStation 2, designed as part of your living room's entertainment centre, can never hope to recreate that online experience. Sure, you can invite your mates over to share a small portion of the screen or even link a couple of machines together, but it's not quite the same. </p> <p>The single-player game is shortlived and the fun of shattering a bot's skull with a well-placed sniper shot is virtually removed by the auto-aiming system. And let's not forget that playing a fast and furious multiplayer first- person shooter with a gamepad is like eating tomato soup with chopsticks. </p> <p>The PC's mouse and keyboard combination has evolved into a perfect interface in the hands of experienced players, allowing a degree of control that is swift, natural and accurate. </p> <p>Unlike Quake III, UT allows you plug in a USB mouse and keyboard, but who wants to sit in front of the TV with that sort of office furniture? </p> <p>Amid constant talk of the battle of the consoles, with Microsoft still hard at work on the Xbox and Nintendo yet to raise the portcullis on the Game Cube, it would be good to see some imagination poured into the Sony machine rather than polished but unnecessary conversions. (MH)</p> <p> <strong>Banjo Tooie</strong></p> <p> N64 \u00a344.99 Rare/Nintendo **** </p> <p>It is fitting that this game should be released so close to Black &amp; White. If Peter Molyneux is Britain's finest games designer, then Rare is certainly the best development team, having churned out impressive titles since the days of the ZX Spectrum. Banjo Tooie is the belated follow-up to Banjo Kazooie, released a couple of years ago to favourable reviews.</p> <p> Kazooie fans will be in seventh heaven, as the game features most of the old characters, moves and locations plus a truckfull of new ones. In describing the plot, suffice to say that Banjo and Kazooie are still a bear and a bird who travel and work together but now have an increased tendency to separate and develop their powers independently. Between them they have around 80 moves and attacks, a baffling number of options that are easy to execute and never available at the same time. </p> <p>Predictably for an N64 game, collecting some kind of token is essential to making progress - in this instance \"jiggies\" - which are randomly strewn across every level. As you might expect from Rare, everything looks and sounds terrific. Vast sugar-coloured 3D levels, intelligent and imaginative enemies, a smattering of puzzles and breathtaking set-pieces. </p> <p>The platform game setting is merely a shell for cramming in as many genres as possible, from shooting games to driving, flying and racing. Be warned, however, that some of the puzzles are fiendishly cryptic Despite the technical magnificence, BT remains an acquired taste. I find the two main characters strangely charmless, especially compared to other platform- poseurs such as Zelda, Mario or even Sonic. Yes, the game rewards persistence with a constant supply of challenges but the controls remain fiddly, the camera angle sluggish and I was content to play the game for just an hour or so - hardly my definition of a true classic. </p> <p>If you love arcade adventures, check it out, if you're expecting the next quantum leap in platform gaming wait and see what Rare are planning for the Nintendo Gamecube later this year.

      "bodyText": "Shadow of Memories Sony PlayStation 2 \u00a339.99 Konami ** Poor Eike - he can't turn his back without someone sticking the knife (or dagger) in. Luckily, he has a digipad - a time-travelling gadget that lets him go back through the ages and prevent his recurring murder. Yes, for once we can forget about aliens, orcs and racing cars - Shadows of Memories is set in a German town full of ageing museum owners and shy waitresses. But it is not only the characterisation that is refreshing. SoM's time-travelling mystery premise is nothing if not original. For example, one level sees you transported back to the 16th century to prevent the planting of a tree that will be used as cover by your assailant 400 years later. Everything you do in the past has an impact on the future and some lateral thinking is required to succeed. However, keeping such a tangled plot together means there are a lot of cut-scenes, which while beautifully animated, don't involve interaction. You'll often feel like you are watching a film or reading a book - not exactly what you'd bought your PS2 for. Then there is the incredibly linear progression of the game. You are often told where to go to find the next clue (and cut-scene) and although your choices do influence the ending, the handholding quickly becomes irksome. Konami has described SoM as a digital novel, which isn't too far off the truth, and it is likely the title will appeal to the type of non-action games player who enjoyed Myst. An admirable attempt at offering something new, Shadow of Memories' narrative is engrossing, it is graphically impressive and genuinely different. What it isn't, alas, is much of a game. (GH) Unreal Tournament Sony PlayStation 2 \u00a339.99 Epic/Infogrames *** The bloodthirst that made gladiatorial fights the sport of choice for ancient Romans hasn't abated, it has merely become digitised. In Unreal Tournament the gladiators chase each other around futuristic arenas, medieval castles suspended in space and dark coliseums of steel, with high-powered pistols, rocket launchers and laser rifles. And although their deaths often leave splashes of gore on the walls and chunks of flesh on the floor, they are instantaneously resurrected until a victor achieves a certain number of kills or frags. Like the faster Quake III and the more sophisticated Counter-Strike, Unreal Tournament was originally a huge PC success. On a computer you can take part in colossal battles with dozens of other players, as part of a team or in a vicious and relentless contest where everyone is your enemy. But the PlayStation 2, designed as part of your living room's entertainment centre, can never hope to recreate that online experience. Sure, you can invite your mates over to share a small portion of the screen or even link a couple of machines together, but it's not quite the same. The single-player game is shortlived and the fun of shattering a bot's skull with a well-placed sniper shot is virtually removed by the auto-aiming system. And let's not forget that playing a fast and furious multiplayer first- person shooter with a gamepad is like eating tomato soup with chopsticks. The PC's mouse and keyboard combination has evolved into a perfect interface in the hands of experienced players, allowing a degree of control that is swift, natural and accurate. Unlike Quake III, UT allows you plug in a USB mouse and keyboard, but who wants to sit in front of the TV with that sort of office furniture? Amid constant talk of the battle of the consoles, with Microsoft still hard at work on the Xbox and Nintendo yet to raise the portcullis on the Game Cube, it would be good to see some imagination poured into the Sony machine rather than polished but unnecessary conversions. (MH) Banjo Tooie N64 \u00a344.99 Rare/Nintendo **** It is fitting that this game should be released so close to Black &amp; White. If Peter Molyneux is Britain's finest games designer, then Rare is certainly the best development team, having churned out impressive titles since the days of the ZX Spectrum. Banjo Tooie is the belated follow-up to Banjo Kazooie, released a couple of years ago to favourable reviews. Kazooie fans will be in seventh heaven, as the game features most of the old characters, moves and locations plus a truckfull of new ones. In describing the plot, suffice to say that Banjo and Kazooie are still a bear and a bird who travel and work together but now have an increased tendency to separate and develop their powers independently. Between them they have around 80 moves and attacks, a baffling number of options that are easy to execute and never available at the same time. Predictably for an N64 game, collecting some kind of token is essential to making progress - in this instance \"jiggies\" - which are randomly strewn across every level. As you might expect from Rare, everything looks and sounds terrific. Vast sugar-coloured 3D levels, intelligent and imaginative enemies, a smattering of puzzles and breathtaking set-pieces. The platform game setting is merely a shell for cramming in as many genres as possible, from shooting games to driving, flying and racing. Be warned, however, that some of the puzzles are fiendishly cryptic Despite the technical magnificence, BT remains an acquired taste. I find the two main characters strangely charmless, especially compared to other platform- poseurs such as Zelda, Mario or even Sonic. Yes, the game rewards persistence with a constant supply of challenges but the controls remain fiddly, the camera angle sluggish and I was content to play the game for just an hour or so - hardly my definition of a true classic. If you love arcade adventures, check it out, if you're expecting the next quantum leap in platform gaming wait and see what Rare are planning for the Nintendo Gamecube later this year. (MA)",

The damage he did to Israel was infinitely greater. The repercussions of that adventure, which lasted less than 24 hours and resulted in the death of one Palestinian and injuries to 38 others, will be felt in Israel and internationally for a long time to come.</p> <p>Mr Sharon sent his troops into a Palestinian autonomous area in Gaza at dawn and pulled them out again by nightfall under pressure from the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, who described the action as \"excessive and disproportionate\". By US standards, it was a harsh judgement.</p> <p>The initial reaction within Israel yesterday was surprisingly subdued. Right-wing Jewish settlers protested that Israel, by bowing to US pressure, had ceased to be an independent country. That was a minority view. There was little criticism, even from the left, for his calamitous action. But there should be a clamour of criticism coming from within Israel. Mr Sharon was elected on a ticket of bringing security to Israel after the uncertain touch of his predecessor, Ehud Barak, and he has failed.</p> <p>For the Palestinians, one of the most potent images leading up to their uprising was the disarray that accompanied the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon last year. The message they can draw from Tuesday's events, perhaps wrongly but dangerously, is that Israel is weak, susceptible to international pressure.</p> <p>The Palestinians have reason to hope that international opinion may be tilting in their favour, even in the US. In spite of the seemingly friendly reception given to Mr Sharon by President Bush, the new administration may have one eye on Arab public opinion and those countries' huge oil deposits. It is not just the US which is showing signs of impatience with Mr Sharon. International agreements are supposed to be sacrosanct. Israel signed up to the Oslo accords, agreeing that parts of Gaza and the West Bank would be under the autonomous control of the Palestinian authority. To the dismay of world opinion, Sharon breached that agreement.</p> <p>The Palestinians will take comfort from the disarray within Israeli ranks. Mr Sharon, astonishingly for a former general, shifted part of the blame on to the general in the field who had said publicly the army would remain in the Palestinian autonomous area for \"days, weeks or months\". Mr Sharon's spokesman, rather than admit that the prime minister had succumbed to US pressure, criticised the general for his remarks.</p> <p>The Sharon adventure failed even at its most basic level. If it was intended to stop Palestinian mortar attacks, as the Israeli PM said, then it had no impact. The Palestinians opened fire again yesterday. Israel is right to place responsibility for such attacks on the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. Part of the Oslo accord was that the Palestinian authority should ensure that attacks were not launched from its territory against Israel.

      "bodyText": "The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, destroyed four Palestinian border posts during Tuesday's ill-fated reoccupation of territory in the Gaza Strip. The damage he did to Israel was infinitely greater. The repercussions of that adventure, which lasted less than 24 hours and resulted in the death of one Palestinian and injuries to 38 others, will be felt in Israel and internationally for a long time to come. Mr Sharon sent his troops into a Palestinian autonomous area in Gaza at dawn and pulled them out again by nightfall under pressure from the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, who described the action as \"excessive and disproportionate\". By US standards, it was a harsh judgement. The initial reaction within Israel yesterday was surprisingly subdued. Right-wing Jewish settlers protested that Israel, by bowing to US pressure, had ceased to be an independent country. That was a minority view. There was little criticism, even from the left, for his calamitous action. But there should be a clamour of criticism coming from within Israel. Mr Sharon was elected on a ticket of bringing security to Israel after the uncertain touch of his predecessor, Ehud Barak, and he has failed. For the Palestinians, one of the most potent images leading up to their uprising was the disarray that accompanied the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon last year. The message they can draw from Tuesday's events, perhaps wrongly but dangerously, is that Israel is weak, susceptible to international pressure. The Palestinians have reason to hope that international opinion may be tilting in their favour, even in the US. In spite of the seemingly friendly reception given to Mr Sharon by President Bush, the new administration may have one eye on Arab public opinion and those countries' huge oil deposits. It is not just the US which is showing signs of impatience with Mr Sharon. International agreements are supposed to be sacrosanct. Israel signed up to the Oslo accords, agreeing that parts of Gaza and the West Bank would be under the autonomous control of the Palestinian authority. To the dismay of world opinion, Sharon breached that agreement. The Palestinians will take comfort from the disarray within Israeli ranks. Mr Sharon, astonishingly for a former general, shifted part of the blame on to the general in the field who had said publicly the army would remain in the Palestinian autonomous area for \"days, weeks or months\". Mr Sharon's spokesman, rather than admit that the prime minister had succumbed to US pressure, criticised the general for his remarks. The Sharon adventure failed even at its most basic level. If it was intended to stop Palestinian mortar attacks, as the Israeli PM said, then it had no impact. The Palestinians opened fire again yesterday. Israel is right to place responsibility for such attacks on the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. Part of the Oslo accord was that the Palestinian authority should ensure that attacks were not launched from its territory against Israel. If Mr Arafat is to create a truly independent Palestinian state, he must ensure that that state alone has a monopoly of military and police control and curb groups such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad and his own Fatah. Mr Sharon may have a more ominous reason for Tuesday's short incursion. He could be adopting an incremental approach, preparing Israeli and international opinion for a lengthy reoccupation. If that is his long-term aim, it is a colossal misjudgment, on par with his invasion of Lebanon in 1982, a bloody mistake that cost Israel dear.

      "body": "<p>There is something about flashers, is there not, that brings out the type of nudge-nudge innuendo more commonly associated with a Benny Hill sketch than the sense of threat attached to a sex offender. This week, we were reminded of this by the antics of two \"zip experts\" battling it out at Maidstone magistrates court. Andrew Chatfield, a 45-year-old police officer, has pleaded not guilty of deliberately flashing at a group of women in the lounge of an old people's home. The case rests on whether the corduroy trouser flies, which had a tooth locking mechanism, could have come undone accidentally.</p> <p>The case raises an important issue. Should we be trivialising a crime that is classed as a sexual offence? Little is ever discussed about the motivation of flashers beyond the neat stereotype of the sad loner in a grubby mac. A common response among women on the receiving end of this most unwanted revelation is to laugh and walk away. Perhaps this is why so many cases go unreported, despite the fact that, on anecdotal evidence, the crime appears to be prevalent.</p> <p>Most women of my acquaintance say they have been flashed at on at least one if not several occasions. The Home Office doesn't record indecent exposure figures annually but the number of men being proceeded against is declining sharply. In 1997, the most up-to-date figures available, the numbers had fallen by half to 1,315 cases. It is not clear why this is, but a major factor must surely be that we are taking the crime less seriously.</p> <p>According to police and sex therapists who treat flashers, the \"harmless old git\" tag is wildly off-beam. The flasher is more likely to be a young man - they start offending in their teens and, unless treated, continue throughout their lives - who may, over time, branch out into more serious contact sex crimes, including rape. Flashers are also highly likely to become involved in crimes against children. The law is widely regarded as being ineffective and the Home Office has been preparing for a judicial review since 1974.</p> <p>Flashers tend to be arrested under Section 4 of the 1824 Vagrancy Act which states that \"every person wilfully, openly, lewdly and obscenely exposing his person with intent to insult any female ... shall be deemed a rogue and vagabond.\" The maximum penalty is three months in prison on summary conviction, one year on a second conviction. Even if a woman does go to the police - and they do advise women to report every incident, no matter how trivial - under existing law there is not much hope of the culprit being caught. Police usually need to catch the man in the act before they can make an arrest.</p> <p>Women's personal reactions inevitably vary according to context. Lorraine MacDonald was on her way to a party with two female friends on a Saturday evening a fortnight ago. After a couple of beers in the pub, they headed off to a nearby station where they stood waiting for a train to take them from south London into town. It was 8pm and reasonably busy. MacDonald was idly looking down the platform to check the train indicator board when something attracted her attention. She abruptly squealed with laughter, nudging both her friends to take a look. Soon they, too, were convulsed with giggles.</p> <p>\"I've seen better on the end of a cocktail stick, mate,\" yelled one of the friends. \"Yeah, that looks like a penis, only smaller,\" heckled the other. The man parked on a nearby bench did not conform to the recognisable stereotype of your common or garden flasher. He was in his 20s, reasonably attractive and seemed nonplussed by the volley of insults from the women.</p> <p>\"At first I couldn't believe my eyes - it was sticking right out of his trousers. He was looking straight at us, too. Laughing seemed to deflate him, though - at any rate it made him put it away,\" MacDonald says. \"After a couple of minutes he got up and walked out of the station. Our train arrived and although we laughed about it throughout the evening, we didn't give much thought to the guy. It certainly didn't occur to us to report it to the police.\"</p> <p>But sometimes there is a greater sense of threat. Mary Dunn was flashed at while taking a rest from jogging in Regents Park in her lunch hour. \"I was standing having a drink when this guy appeared from behind a tree. At first I thought he was relieving himself but he stood there waving it at me. My first reaction was to laugh. It was fairly busy, so I didn't feel threatened, although he was only a few yards away.\"</p> <p>To Dunn's surprise, though, a few days later she found herself dwelling on the incident. \"I couldn't get the image out of my mind and that began to make me feel anxious and upset.\"</p> <p>Walking home from the station the following week - a route she had taken many times before - Dunn says she suddenly didn't feel as safe as she usually did. \"It began to dawn on me that I did feel violated by what had happened, even though I'd thought it was a big joke at the time.\"</p> <p>In fact Dunn is not alone in reacting this way following an encounter with a flasher; although most will regard the event as too trivial to take to the police, many women feel offended, ashamed and even guilty afterwards. A study cited in the Home Office review paper supports this view, stating that in 100 victims of indecent exposure, \"fear, shock and disgust were the most common reactions, and that the fear concerned was the fear of death.\"</p> <p>\"We see a lot of women who have been victims of flashers,\" says Tamara Wilder of Victim Support. \"Just because it is a fairly common thing, as an offence it seems to have been trivialised, which does not necessarily reflect what a woman goes through when it happens to her. Depending on the circumstances, it can be a very uncomfortable experience, primarily because you don't know what the man is going to do next. A lot of women do not want to report the offence to the police. They may well be asking themselves if they were in some way to blame for what happened, if they could have subconsciously encouraged the flasher to have behaved that way because of the way she was dressed or the way she looked at him.\"</p> <p>As a general rule, ought we as women to be taking the crime more seriously? \"Yes,\" says Daniel Wilcox, a forensic psychologist in Birmingham who treats sex offenders, including flashers, for the probation service. \"Where a person gets into deviance, they are very likely to move into other offences. Typically, flashers have the highest crossover of all sex offenders into crimes against children. With flashers, people tend to focus on the jokes, but other behaviours will develop, such as rape, bestiality, assault.\"</p> <p>This is not to say that the flasher you see on the railway platform today is a rapist. \"They work up to committing more serious crimes over time,\" Wilcox says. \"However, flashers are prone to stalking, rubbing themselves up against women in crowded trains (frottage) and sending offensive pornographic letters and photographs to targeted women; it's part of the offender profile.\"</p> <p>So, given all of that, here's a final dilemma for us all. How do you deal with the flasher? Is it wise to shout abuse or should we not react at all?</p> <p>\"Ignore him and walk away,\" Wilcox advises. \"Flashing is an angry act. These men are so unskilled at communicating with women, they tell me they would find it easier to flash at a woman than to go up and say hello. Remember, he wants a reaction and if you do react, he may well convince himself that you secretly like what he's doing. For example, if you walk past a garden where a flasher operates regularly, he will tell himself that you are going that way because you desire to see him.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the solution rests with a team of clinical psychiatrists in America. They recently pioneered successful treatment of flashers by lining up a row of female volunteers at a clinic. The flasher was told to expose himself.

      "bodyText": "A jury at the Old Bailey was discharged yesterday after failing to reach a verdict on 10 Afghans accused of taking part in Britain's longest hijack at Stansted airport. An 11th man, Aminullah Mohamedi, was cleared of all charges following the three-month trial that is estimated to have cost more than \u00a35m. The jury of six women and five men had been deliberating for 40 hours when Mr Justice Butterfield was handed a note from the jury saying it was \"absolutely deadlocked\" on 49 charges involving the 10 remaining defendants. Bruce Houlder QC, prosecuting, said the crown would seek a retrial of the men who are alleged to have taken control of an Ariana Airlines flight after it had taken off from the Afghan capital, Kabul, on what was supposed to have been a 40-minute internal flight in February last year. The aircraft, carrying 173 passengers and 14 crew - including 21 children, touched down in Tashkent, the Uzbek capital, Kazakstan and Moscow before arriving at Stansted at 2am on February 7 last year. The siege ended after three days of tense negotiations. The defendants, Ali Safi, 35; Abdul Shohab, 21; Taimur Shah, 29; Muhammed Kazim,28; Waheed Lutfi,23; Reshed Ahmadi,19; Nazamuddin Mohammidy,27; Abdul Ghayur,25; Mohammed Showaib, 21; Aminullah Mohamedi, 41; and Mohammed Safi, 33; all denied hijacking, two charges of false imprisonment, possessing firearms with intent to cause fear of violence and posessing explosives. After hearing submissions that there was no evidence to support the charges of hijacking and false imprisonment, the judge ordered the jury to acquit Mr Mohamedi, 41, on both counts. Not guilty verdicts were returned on the other three charges. He had told police he was employed by one of the other defendants and did not know anything about the hijack until he boarded the plane. Waheed Lufti was cleared by the jury of hijacking but they were unable to agree a verdict on the other four charges. A 12th defendant, Khalil Ullah, 31, who fell ill during the trial faces a retrial at a later date. The defendants were represented by a team of 24 defence barristers, including 12 QCs, while a further three barristers, including a QC, were used to present the prosecution case.

But after his team were again left stranded on third base in their attempt to reign supreme in Europe, a tetchy Ferguson refused to expand on pre-match hints that he might have to strengthen his side, saying: \"I'm not answering that question.\" </p> <p> His captain Roy Keane was much more forthcoming. \"We are just not good enough,\" he insisted and he strongly suggested that this United team needs to be broken up and new players brought in. </p> <p> Keane had suggested before last night that heads might roll - among them his own - if United failed in their Munich mission. Now he said: \"You have to face the facts and I think the signs have been there this season PSV, Anderlecht, Panathinaikos - while we were also lucky to get to the first stage even. </p> <p> \"The players gave it their all tonight but we are just not good enough and maybe it's time to move on. Maybe it's the end of the road for this team, although I'm not sure. </p> <p> \"It's no good winning the Premier League. We need to step up a level in Europe. I keep going on about Real Madrid but they're setting the standards we have to match.\" </p> <p> Ferguson said: \"You are all entitled to your opinion about which team was the best over the two legs but I think we are as good as Bayern, no question. They were the better side in the second half at our place, and I think we were the better side tonight. </p> <p> \"It was very bad defending that cost us our place in the next stage. The first goal was down to our defensive errors and that was the last thing we wanted to happen, conceding early. And the second goal was a killer. </p> <p> \"We had plenty of time and we created some good chances. Oliver Kahn also made some good saves to keep us out but I felt that if we had scored a second goal we would have gone on to win.\" </p> <p> Bayern's manager Ottmar Hitzfeld disagreed. \"It was a defensive battle in the second half but we lived up to the challenge and the pressure,\" he said. \"We did not see it as taking revenge, merely as winning a match to progress to the semi-finals. I thought we deserved to win on our performance.\" </p> <p> Bayern face Real in the semi-finals after the champions overcame Galatasaray 3-0 in Spain, Raul (twice) and Ivan Helguera scoring in the first half, to triumph 5-3 on aggregate. </p> <p> Hitzfeld and Ferguson were agreed on one thing: whoever wins the European Cup will have to overcome Real, whom Ferguson believes have become even more powerful because of Luis Figo's signing. </p> <p> United's manager sounded almost wistful as he mentioned this, perhaps wondering whether his employers would be willing to loosen the purse strings to the extent where he can spend \u00a337m on a single player who might make his side European champions again. </p> <p> Given Keane's much publicised fears about players' futures in the event of elimination Ferguson made a point of praising his captain's contribution. </p> <p> Ferguson has only one more chance of winning the European Cup for a second time before he retires from management at the end of next season.

      "bodyText": "Manchester United's financial marriage with the New York Yankees was supposed to provide Sir Alex Ferguson with the funds to build a side capable of conquering the world. But after his team were again left stranded on third base in their attempt to reign supreme in Europe, a tetchy Ferguson refused to expand on pre-match hints that he might have to strengthen his side, saying: \"I'm not answering that question.\" His captain Roy Keane was much more forthcoming. \"We are just not good enough,\" he insisted and he strongly suggested that this United team needs to be broken up and new players brought in. Keane had suggested before last night that heads might roll - among them his own - if United failed in their Munich mission. Now he said: \"You have to face the facts and I think the signs have been there this season PSV, Anderlecht, Panathinaikos - while we were also lucky to get to the first stage even. \"The players gave it their all tonight but we are just not good enough and maybe it's time to move on. Maybe it's the end of the road for this team, although I'm not sure. \"It's no good winning the Premier League. We need to step up a level in Europe. I keep going on about Real Madrid but they're setting the standards we have to match.\" Ferguson said: \"You are all entitled to your opinion about which team was the best over the two legs but I think we are as good as Bayern, no question. They were the better side in the second half at our place, and I think we were the better side tonight. \"It was very bad defending that cost us our place in the next stage. The first goal was down to our defensive errors and that was the last thing we wanted to happen, conceding early. And the second goal was a killer. \"We had plenty of time and we created some good chances. Oliver Kahn also made some good saves to keep us out but I felt that if we had scored a second goal we would have gone on to win.\" Bayern's manager Ottmar Hitzfeld disagreed. \"It was a defensive battle in the second half but we lived up to the challenge and the pressure,\" he said. \"We did not see it as taking revenge, merely as winning a match to progress to the semi-finals. I thought we deserved to win on our performance.\" Bayern face Real in the semi-finals after the champions overcame Galatasaray 3-0 in Spain, Raul (twice) and Ivan Helguera scoring in the first half, to triumph 5-3 on aggregate. Hitzfeld and Ferguson were agreed on one thing: whoever wins the European Cup will have to overcome Real, whom Ferguson believes have become even more powerful because of Luis Figo's signing. United's manager sounded almost wistful as he mentioned this, perhaps wondering whether his employers would be willing to loosen the purse strings to the extent where he can spend \u00a337m on a single player who might make his side European champions again. Given Keane's much publicised fears about players' futures in the event of elimination Ferguson made a point of praising his captain's contribution. Ferguson has only one more chance of winning the European Cup for a second time before he retires from management at the end of next season. So it is a question of whether he is prepared to put personal ambition before loyalty to his players, and whether, in the cold light of day, he adheres to his belief that his squad really is good enough. \u0095 Real Madrid are 6-4 favourites with Hill's to lift the European Cup ahead of Bayern (13-5), Valencia (11-4) and Leeds (9-2). A repeat Real-Valencia final is quoted at 8-5. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say. Send your comments, as sharp or as stupid as you like, to football.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk",

English is capturing some of their territory, despite EU treaties and summit meetings proclaiming a commitment to diversity.

The Norwegian Minister of Transport has protested about the website the SAS airline, which has the three Scandinavian governments as majority shareholders, being exclusively in English. The Swedish government recently commissioned a major survey of Swedish in all key domains in Sweden and in European Union institutions. The study documents how English is taking over from Swedish.

Countries applying for EU membership have probably assumed that their languages will have the same rights as other official languages.

According to the Brussels-based European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages, about 40m people in Europe speak a language other than the dominant language of the country where they reside.

Linguistic minorities in Italy have had a good year, with far-reaching national legislation allowing them to finally begin consolidating their education and media. Protection of minorities in the Danish-German border region is conducted on the basis of international reciprocal agreements between both countries. And the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages brings together representatives of all minorities three times a year to exchange experiences and to press the EU for funding and recognition. This does not mean, however, that minority language communities are ignorant about the dominance of English, oblivious to anything other than their own regional struggles. Notwithstanding their problems with education, the Frisians last year began a pilot project dividing primary school hours between their own language, Dutch and English. A similar project was recently launched in the Basque Country with equal emphasis on Basque, Spanish and English. And in Luxembourg, English is indeed the first foreign language taught to schoolchildren, but not before they master Luxembourgish, French and German. This latter point is worth making because it underlines another important element of the dynamic. Speakers of minority languages cannot afford to be against learning the dominant language surrounding them. They have no choice in the matter, as this language is essential for communication with their neighbours, sometimes literally in the next house. This does not mean, however, that they should discard their native language as if it were an impediment to progress. It is true that this has happened, dramatically in the case of Ireland, and still continues to happen in some of the smaller minorities. But acquisition of English or any other dominant language does not have to occur at the expense of the language of the home or community. Most theorists agree that language remains the primary identity marker. The slow yet perceptible development of academic theories exploring the links between identity, language and socio-economic development is becoming another important support mechanism for minority language communities. The Brussels-based Research Centre on Multilingualism has recently urged the development of \"econolinguistics\", a new academic discipline linking multilingualism and economic development. The centre's research could also point towards ways of developing an equitable language policy at EU level. It suggests the development of a language policy based on the same compensatory principles already used in agricultural and regional economic policies. This would form the basis of an EU programme for all languages with limited geographical bases or facing other threats to their future vitality (which could, of course, include \"smaller\" languages such as Danish or Finnish). The central planks of such a programme would be: positive discrimination, such as providing financial support for producing materials or training personnel in the language; decentralisation, to allow enhanced use of the language at local level; and the overall promotion of multilingualism where no language is developed at the expense of another. Such a suggestion could help overcome the current narrow debate about the future of official languages in an enlarged Union.</p> <p>Finally, to an issue which is increasingly gaining attention in the language debate, but with which EU leaders are showing little enthusiasm to engage: languages of immigrant communities. Most of the discourse about lesser-used languages focuses solely on indigenous or autochthonous minorities, referred to in some states as \"national minorities\". In a country such as Germany, where Turks far outnumber any indigenous language group, the issue can no longer be ignored. Quite apart from the fact that the \"new\" immigrant communities will be the \"old\" minorities of tomorrow, their languages often face similar, if not more acute problems than \"national\" groups. In the Netherlands, itself containing a high percentage of immigrants, research has begun into the common challenges facing both \"old\" and \"new\". Whether or not the EU is willing to include the thorny issue of immigration in a future language policy remains a point of debate, but neither \"old\" nor \"new\" are displaying willingness to be eaten by the international shark of English.</p>",

However the FA has revealed that one of its options is to increase the penalty recommended by a joint Football League and FA disciplinary panel. </p> <p>There was criticism of the panel's decision to find Chesterfield guilty of only two of 90 misconduct charges after a Football League inquiry. The other charges, including allegations of irregular payments, were deemed \"not proven\". </p> <p>Once the FA has ruled, the Football League must decide whether to ratify its own panel's recommendation to dock the nine points and impose a \u00a320,000 fine for a breach of regulations in a transfer and under-reporting of gate receipts. Chesterfield are still the subject of a police inquiry. </p> <p>Chelsea could sign Bradford's striker Benito Carbone this summer if his close friend Gianfranco Zola leaves Stamford Bridge. \"Zola would still have a role to play if he decides to stay,\" said Chelsea's manager Claudio Ranieri. \"However if not, then I must have a replacement ready and Carbone certainly would be a player we would consider.\" </p> <p>The FA has rescinded Paul Dickov's three-match suspension for being sent off at Everton this month. The referee David Elleray reduced the Manchester City forward's punishment to a booking after reviewing the incident on video. </p> <p>Dickov, who has just completed a two-match suspension for picking up 10 bookings this season, is now available to face Manchester United on Saturday. </p> <p>Paul Gascoigne has resumed training and is in contention for a place in the Everton squad to face Bradford on Saturday week. The midfielder was given the all-clear on his knee by a specialist on Tuesday. </p> <p>The First Division champions Fulham are reportedly chasing the Monaco defenders Philippe Christanval and Martin Djetou, valued at \u00a38m apiece, and Paris St-Germain's \u00a37m-rated winger Laurent Robert. </p> <p>Dundee are resigned to losing their 33-year-old Argentine striker Claudio Caniggia at the end of the season. Peter Marr, the club's chief executive, said: \"With Claudio's ambition to play in Japan in the World Cup and possibly the chance to play in the Champions League to show he is worth a place with Argentina, I think that's what's behind his move.\" </p> <p>The Crystal Palace midfelder Jamie Pollock has extended his loan at Birmingham City for another month.

      "bodyText": "Chesterfield have confirmed they will appeal over the nine-point deduction recommended for misconduct, but now risk the possibility of seeing the punishment increased. The Third Division leaders had until 4pm yesterday to confirm their appeal, which will be heard by a Football Association board on April 30. However the FA has revealed that one of its options is to increase the penalty recommended by a joint Football League and FA disciplinary panel. There was criticism of the panel's decision to find Chesterfield guilty of only two of 90 misconduct charges after a Football League inquiry. The other charges, including allegations of irregular payments, were deemed \"not proven\". Once the FA has ruled, the Football League must decide whether to ratify its own panel's recommendation to dock the nine points and impose a \u00a320,000 fine for a breach of regulations in a transfer and under-reporting of gate receipts. Chesterfield are still the subject of a police inquiry. Chelsea could sign Bradford's striker Benito Carbone this summer if his close friend Gianfranco Zola leaves Stamford Bridge. \"Zola would still have a role to play if he decides to stay,\" said Chelsea's manager Claudio Ranieri. \"However if not, then I must have a replacement ready and Carbone certainly would be a player we would consider.\" The FA has rescinded Paul Dickov's three-match suspension for being sent off at Everton this month. The referee David Elleray reduced the Manchester City forward's punishment to a booking after reviewing the incident on video. Dickov, who has just completed a two-match suspension for picking up 10 bookings this season, is now available to face Manchester United on Saturday. Paul Gascoigne has resumed training and is in contention for a place in the Everton squad to face Bradford on Saturday week. The midfielder was given the all-clear on his knee by a specialist on Tuesday. The First Division champions Fulham are reportedly chasing the Monaco defenders Philippe Christanval and Martin Djetou, valued at \u00a38m apiece, and Paris St-Germain's \u00a37m-rated winger Laurent Robert. Dundee are resigned to losing their 33-year-old Argentine striker Claudio Caniggia at the end of the season. Peter Marr, the club's chief executive, said: \"With Claudio's ambition to play in Japan in the World Cup and possibly the chance to play in the Champions League to show he is worth a place with Argentina, I think that's what's behind his move.\" The Crystal Palace midfelder Jamie Pollock has extended his loan at Birmingham City for another month. The Londoners have also lost their captain Fan Zhiyi, who looks likely to miss the last four games playing World Cup qualifiers for China. Charlton's Sasa Ilic has been called up by Yugoslavia for the World Cup qualifier with Russia in Belgrade on Wednesday. The 28-year-old keeper has won one cap, as a substitute against Israel three years ago. Football League clubs will observe a minute's silence before this weekend's matches in memory of the referee Mike North, who collapsed and died during Monday's match at Southend. The match officials will also wear green shirts with black armbands. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
