      "body": "<p>The thought of making your Premiership debut at Old Trafford might prompt most managers to follow Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec's lead and make a beeline for the nearest airport. Not Claudio Ranieri. \"It will,\" says Chelsea's coach, \"be a beautiful experience.\" </p> <p>And the 48-year-old will not necessarily be crying into his cappuccino if Chelsea fail to pick up three points. \"Victory isn't important,\" he explains. \"I want to see how hard my players will play and fight.\" </p> <p>Ranieri knows United embody much of what Chelsea have lacked of late: unity, work ethic and fierce determination. Moreover, they boast not just backbone but the British backbone he wants. True, Sir Alex Ferguson's team let slip a 2-0 lead at West Ham, but it is hard to imagine them giving as supine a performance as Chelsea did in losing 2-0 at home to Leicester. </p> <p>\"In terms of quality we are probably not behind Manchester United,\" Ranieri says. \"But in the spirit and determination of the team we are.\" The notes he scribbled from his seat in the stand against St Gallen and Leicester presumably read \"must try harder\". </p> <p>In that regard the Italian seems to be succeeding. \"We're all inspired by the fact that we have a new manager,\" says Tore Andre Flo. \"Everyone is giving that little bit extra to show what they can do.\" </p> <p>Ranieri's pronouncement that he will abandon Gianluca Vialli's rotation policy has also focused a few troubled minds. Some players came to resent the constant changes. Flo, a frequent victim of the old system, says: \"I like this idea, so all I have to do is battle for a regular place in the team.\" </p> <p>That honour, of course, is open to all. Neil Clement, who left Stamford Bridge for West Bromwich Albion in the summer and remains in contact with Jody Morris and others, explains: \"They've been told by the new man they are all on trial.\" </p> <p>Which is not to suggest Ranieri is a tyrant. During his time at Valencia he agreed to switch training to the morning so players could see their children after school. Yet his disciplinarian approach is good news by the sound of things, particularly as he arrives from outside the club with a sound reputation. </p> <p>\"They need someone to look up to, whereas Vialli was more like one of the lads,\" says Nick Crittenden, a young midfielder who left for non-League Yeovil in the close season. \"I remember when Glenn Hoddle was there you wouldn't take liberties with him.

      "bodyText": "The thought of making your Premiership debut at Old Trafford might prompt most managers to follow Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec's lead and make a beeline for the nearest airport. Not Claudio Ranieri. \"It will,\" says Chelsea's coach, \"be a beautiful experience.\" And the 48-year-old will not necessarily be crying into his cappuccino if Chelsea fail to pick up three points. \"Victory isn't important,\" he explains. \"I want to see how hard my players will play and fight.\" Ranieri knows United embody much of what Chelsea have lacked of late: unity, work ethic and fierce determination. Moreover, they boast not just backbone but the British backbone he wants. True, Sir Alex Ferguson's team let slip a 2-0 lead at West Ham, but it is hard to imagine them giving as supine a performance as Chelsea did in losing 2-0 at home to Leicester. \"In terms of quality we are probably not behind Manchester United,\" Ranieri says. \"But in the spirit and determination of the team we are.\" The notes he scribbled from his seat in the stand against St Gallen and Leicester presumably read \"must try harder\". In that regard the Italian seems to be succeeding. \"We're all inspired by the fact that we have a new manager,\" says Tore Andre Flo. \"Everyone is giving that little bit extra to show what they can do.\" Ranieri's pronouncement that he will abandon Gianluca Vialli's rotation policy has also focused a few troubled minds. Some players came to resent the constant changes. Flo, a frequent victim of the old system, says: \"I like this idea, so all I have to do is battle for a regular place in the team.\" That honour, of course, is open to all. Neil Clement, who left Stamford Bridge for West Bromwich Albion in the summer and remains in contact with Jody Morris and others, explains: \"They've been told by the new man they are all on trial.\" Which is not to suggest Ranieri is a tyrant. During his time at Valencia he agreed to switch training to the morning so players could see their children after school. Yet his disciplinarian approach is good news by the sound of things, particularly as he arrives from outside the club with a sound reputation. \"They need someone to look up to, whereas Vialli was more like one of the lads,\" says Nick Crittenden, a young midfielder who left for non-League Yeovil in the close season. \"I remember when Glenn Hoddle was there you wouldn't take liberties with him. You had to be in time for training otherwise you were fined. \"But Ruud Gullit wasn't the strictest of managers, and when Vialli took over a few people started turning up late and things like that. It wasn't a big problem but he needed to be stricter and let them know who's boss.\" Ranieri will do that, if needs be. His commitment to talent rather than reputation was shown at Valencia, where he discarded big-name underachievers and brought on the youngsters such as Claudio Lopez, Gaizka Mendieta and Miguel Angel Angulo. Mendieta, he recalls, was about to be released; Lopez, bought by Lazio for \u00a317m this summer, was \"said to be no good because he ran too fast and forgot about the ball\". The clean slate, and the search for an English spine, will go down well with the club's youngsters. \"It was like knocking your head against a brick wall,\" Crittenden recalls. \"You could play well in the reserves but it didn't matter; you had no chance. Mates of mine who are still at the club like Stephen Broad and Jay Richardson have been looking to get away but that might change now.\" Such welcome alterations should not cloud the good work Vialli did.

Then he could follow the Big Brother line further and institute a viewer's vote about which member of the defence should be kicked out this week: will it be Silver, the Brazilian ladies' man, or Dave, the one with the mid-life crisis ponytail? In the meantime, let us hope Alan Shearer is not the next to get on-line. Because the whole system could collapse with fans logging on to see webcam pictures of their hero creosoting the fence.",

The judges have expressly limited it to cases where X cannot be saved without killing Y, where Y, by continuing to exist, would inevitably kill X, and where X is capable of an independent life but Y is not, whatever the medical intervention. In short, the ruling covers twins such as Mary and Jodie but no other type of case. The three judges were faced with what may be the most difficult conundrum of their careers. Both twins would die without an operation; with an operation Jodie could be saved, though Mary would die. The law forbids the sacrifice of an innocent life to save another.

      "body": "<p>The following is an extract from Lord Justice Ward's summary. Lord Justice Brooke and Lord Robert Walker agreed.</p> <p>The unique and the crucial feature of the case is that the twins share a common aorta. That enables Jodie's heart to pump the blood she oxygenates through Mary's body as Mary's heart and lungs have no capacity to sustain life. She would have died probably in the womb but certainly at birth but for the life-sustaining support she received from her sister.</p> <p>The sad fact is that she lives on borrowed time, all of it borrowed from her sister. She is incapable of independent existence. She is designated for death.</p> <p>Doing the work for two imposes a terrible strain on Jodie's heart. It is common ground that her heart will fail and she will suffer a cardiac arrest. She is not expected to live more than three to six months, or perhaps a little longer. Mary's death will inevitably follow hers.</p> <p>It is not in dispute that the twins can be separated without significant risk to Jodie. That will leave Jodie living a more or less normal life, not without its problems, of course, and no one will shoulder the burden of those difficulties more than these devoted parents, especially as the facilities at home do not match the services they can enjoy here.</p> <p>The separation will result in certain death for Mary within minutes of the common aorta being severed. Thus in deciding whether or not to consent to this operation the parents have had to confront the cruel reality that surgery will save Jodie but it will kill Mary. They could not bring themselves to give that consent because their girls are equal in their eyes and in their love. They sincerely believe that it was God's will that they be born with the afflictions they have and that they should be left to live their lives joined together as they are for so long as God in his mercy shall ordain it.</p> <p>The hospital, on the other hand, could not in conscience suffer a life to be lost and, although they were fully entitled to submit to the parents' wishes, they are every bit as entitled to invite the court to decide that critical question of life and death. That is what a court is for.</p> <p>The case has raised acute moral and ethical questions and those principles and the religious foundations for them have been well presented to us by the Archbishop of Westminster to whom we are indebted. They have rightly become the subject of huge public interest and public debate.</p> <p>It is, however, necessary to stress the obvious. This is not a court of morals but a court of law and our decision has to be taken from a solid base of legal principle. So I turn to the law. It is a trite medical law that every person's body is inviolate and that it is an unlawful assault to operate without consent.</p> <p>In the case of a young child, it is not only the right but it is also the duty of the parents to give consent on the child's behalf if it is in the best interests of the child to do so. If the parents refuse, the hospital cannot operate but it is entitled to invite the court to override the parents' refusal and to give approval for the operation.</p> <p>This introduces principles of family law. Again it is trite that the court's duty when determining any question with respect to the upbringing of a child - and that includes the child's medical care - is to make the child's welfare the court's paramount consideration. So what is best for the child dictates the outcome, subject always to this: the court cannot approve a course of action which may be illegal.</p> <p>Thus four crucial issues arise.</p> <p>1. Is it in Jodie's best interests that she be separated from Mary?</p> <p>2. Is it in Mary's best interests that she be separated from Jodie?</p> <p>3. If those interests are in conflict can the court balance the interests of one against the other and so allow one to prevail against the other and if that is permissible, how is that balancing exercise to be undertaken?</p> <p>4. If the prevailing interest is in favour of the operation being performed, can it be lawfully performed?</p> <p>There is, however, a preliminary issue both in civil law and criminal law, namely whether or not Mary is a live person in her own right. The medical evidence is overwhelmingly to the effect that she is and the law supports that conclusion. I am delighted that is so. Old notions of \"monstrous birth\" are to [be] deprecated in the 21st century.</p> <p><b> Best interests</b><br></p> <p>As to Jodie's best interests, Johnson J. found and was right to find that the operation would be to her benefit. The experts from the Great Ormond Street hospital for children, who provided a second opinion for us, confirm that Jodie should be able to live a fairly normal or at least a not intolerable life... In my judgment it is overwhelmingly in her interest that she be given the chance to live a normal life with a normal expectation of life. It is certainly not in her interest to be left to die.</p> <p>Determining where Mary's welfare lies is more difficult. The judge found, and I agree, that her state is pitiable and will never improve. There is no reliable way to test whether she is in pain for she responds to pain and pleasure in the same way. Nevertheless the judge accepted evidence that it was \"an horrendous scenario\" to contemplate that Jodie should struggle to drag Mary behind her, something which would have to hurt Mary. The real issue of difficulty for me lies in the judge's finding that the remaining few months of her life if not separated would \"be simply worth nothing to her, they would be hurtful\". This led him to conclude that \"to prolong Mary's life for these few months would be very seriously to her disadvantage\".</p> <p>Whether these remaining months will be hurtful or not is not the important question in this case. What is of real importance and public interest is the assessment that her life is worth nothing... The sanctity of life doctrine is so enshrined as a fundamental principle of law and commands such respect from the law that I am compelled to accept that each life has inherent value in itself however grave the impairment of some of the body's functions may be. I am satisfied that Mary's life, desperate as it is, still has its own ineliminable value and dignity. In my judgment the learned judge was wrong to find it was worth nothing.</p> <p>He also erred in his finding that to prolong Mary's life would be seriously to her disadvantage. He wrongly characterised the nature of the treatment. No treatment was here being proposed to prolong her life in the way [Hillsborough victim] Tony Bland's artificial support systems prolonged his. Surgery would amount to a positive act of invasion of her bodily integrity with no medical or other benefit flowing from it... In my judgment it cannot be in Mary's best interests to undergo surgery which will terminate her life.</p> <p>That places the court on the painfully sharp horns of dilemma. The court's duty is to put the welfare of each child paramount. It is in the best interests of Jodie that separation takes place; it is in the best interests of Mary that it does not. There is an irreconcilable conflict and the court cannot fully honour its separate duty to each child to do what is best for that child. In my judgment the only solution is to balance the welfare of each child against the other to find the least detrimental alternative. In my view the parents take an unduly pessimistic view of the prognosis for Jodie. Their personal hardship in coping with her with such disabilities as she will have to bear command great sympathy but the difficulties for the parents and the difficulties for Jodie cannot outweigh the right to life to which their child is entitled...</p> <p>So I have to balance the welfare of one child against the other. Into each scale goes their right to life. This right is universal: we all share it equally. The scales remain in balance. I am not entitled to value the quality of one human life as worth more than another's and I do not do so. But it is legitimate to look at the actual condition of the children as they are and assess their legitimate expectations when determining whether it is worth treating them. The worthwhileness of the proposed treatment is a legitimate factor to weigh. For the reasons given the treatment is not worthwhile for Mary for one cannot escape from the fact that Mary has always been fated for early death: her capacity to live has been fatally compromised. Though Mary has a right to life, she has little right to be alive. She is alive because and only because, to put it bluntly but nonetheless accurately, she sucks the lifeblood of Jodie and her parasitic living will soon be the cause of Jodie ceasing to live.</p> <p>Jodie is entitled to protest that Mary is killing her. Nobody but the doctors can help Jodie. Mary sadly is beyond any help. The best interests of the twins is to give the chance of life to the child whose actual bodily condition is capable of accepting the chance to her advantage even if that has to be at the cost of the sacrifice of a life which is so unnaturally supported. I am therefore left in no doubt at all that the scales come down heavily in Jodie's favour. I am wholly satisfied that the least detrimental choice is to permit separation to take place.</p> <p>But it remains subject to the analysis of whether the operation is lawful. Two features seem to me to be important. The first is that the doctors are placed under a legal duty to do what is best for their patient. That at once places them in a position of impossible conflict. They are under a duty to Mary not to operate because it will kill her but they are under an equally powerful duty to Jodie obliging them to operate because not to do so will kill this twin... In those circumstances it seems to me the law must allow an escape by permitting the doctors to choose the lesser of the two evils. The doctors must conduct their balancing exercise in the same way as the court has had to do. The answer is the same.</p> <p>There is a second reason why it seems to me that the proposed operation will not in any event offend the sanctity of life principle. This is not an absolute rule. It demands only that life is to be protected from unjust attack. In a joint statement by the Anglican and Roman Catholic bishops in the aftermath of Bland they stated that because human life is a gift from God to be preserved and cherished, the deliberate taking of human life is prohibited except in self-defence or in the legitimate defence of others. The archbishop defines the principle in terms that human life is sacred and inviolable so that one should never aim to cause an innocent person's death by act or omission.</p> <p><b> Helpless</b><br></p> <p>The reality here, harsh as it is to state it and unnatural as it is that it should be happening, is that Mary is killing Jodie. To label Mary as an \"unjust aggressor\" is wholly inappropriate for the sad and helpless position in which Mary finds herself. This unique happening cannot be said to be unlawful. But in my judgment it does not have to be unlawful. The six-year-old boy indiscriminately shooting all and sundry in the school playground is not acting unlawfully because he is too young for his acts so to be classified. In my judgment, however, and this is a judgment on a question of law, not morality - though, for what it is worth, I personally would think the position is the same - that child may be killed in legitimate self-defence. I see no difference in essence between that resort to self-defence and the doctors coming to Jodie's defence and removing the threat of fatal harm to her presented by Mary's draining her life blood.</p> <p>I conclude, therefore, that the operation can be lawfully carried out.</p> <p>The Human Rights Act 1998 looms over us. The rights it guarantees are as much in conflict with each other as the doctors' duties and I do not believe that the court in Strasbourg would come to any other conclusion.</p> <p>I would therefore dismiss the appeal but, lest it be thought that this decision could become authority for any wider proposition such as that a doctor can kill the patient once he has determined that a patient cannot survive, it is important to restate the unique circumstances for which this case is authority. They are that it must be impossible to preserve the life of X without bringing about the death of Y. That Y by his or her very continued existence will inevitably bring about the death of X within a short period of time and that X is capable of living an independent life but Y is incapable under any circumstances, including all forms of medical intervention, of viable independent existence. As I say at the beginning of my judgment this is a very unique case.</p> <p><b>Conjoined twins information sites:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.twinstuff.com/conjoined.htm\" target=\"_new\">Twinstuff.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.conjoined-twins.i-p.com\" target=\"_new\">Conjoined twins</a></p>",

It is not in dispute that the twins can be separated without significant risk to Jodie. That will leave Jodie living a more or less normal life, not without its problems, of course, and no one will shoulder the burden of those difficulties more than these devoted parents, especially as the facilities at home do not match the services they can enjoy here. The separation will result in certain death for Mary within minutes of the common aorta being severed. Thus in deciding whether or not to consent to this operation the parents have had to confront the cruel reality that surgery will save Jodie but it will kill Mary. They could not bring themselves to give that consent because their girls are equal in their eyes and in their love. They sincerely believe that it was God's will that they be born with the afflictions they have and that they should be left to live their lives joined together as they are for so long as God in his mercy shall ordain it. The hospital, on the other hand, could not in conscience suffer a life to be lost and, although they were fully entitled to submit to the parents' wishes, they are every bit as entitled to invite the court to decide that critical question of life and death. That is what a court is for. The case has raised acute moral and ethical questions and those principles and the religious foundations for them have been well presented to us by the Archbishop of Westminster to whom we are indebted. They have rightly become the subject of huge public interest and public debate. It is, however, necessary to stress the obvious. This is not a court of morals but a court of law and our decision has to be taken from a solid base of legal principle. So I turn to the law. It is a trite medical law that every person's body is inviolate and that it is an unlawful assault to operate without consent. In the case of a young child, it is not only the right but it is also the duty of the parents to give consent on the child's behalf if it is in the best interests of the child to do so. If the parents refuse, the hospital cannot operate but it is entitled to invite the court to override the parents' refusal and to give approval for the operation. This introduces principles of family law. Again it is trite that the court's duty when determining any question with respect to the upbringing of a child - and that includes the child's medical care - is to make the child's welfare the court's paramount consideration. So what is best for the child dictates the outcome, subject always to this: the court cannot approve a course of action which may be illegal. Thus four crucial issues arise. 1. Is it in Jodie's best interests that she be separated from Mary? 2. Is it in Mary's best interests that she be separated from Jodie? 3. If those interests are in conflict can the court balance the interests of one against the other and so allow one to prevail against the other and if that is permissible, how is that balancing exercise to be undertaken? 4. If the prevailing interest is in favour of the operation being performed, can it be lawfully performed? There is, however, a preliminary issue both in civil law and criminal law, namely whether or not Mary is a live person in her own right. The medical evidence is overwhelmingly to the effect that she is and the law supports that conclusion. I am delighted that is so. Old notions of \"monstrous birth\" are to [be] deprecated in the 21st century. Best interests As to Jodie's best interests, Johnson J. found and was right to find that the operation would be to her benefit. The experts from the Great Ormond Street hospital for children, who provided a second opinion for us, confirm that Jodie should be able to live a fairly normal or at least a not intolerable life... In my judgment it is overwhelmingly in her interest that she be given the chance to live a normal life with a normal expectation of life. It is certainly not in her interest to be left to die. Determining where Mary's welfare lies is more difficult. The judge found, and I agree, that her state is pitiable and will never improve. There is no reliable way to test whether she is in pain for she responds to pain and pleasure in the same way. Nevertheless the judge accepted evidence that it was \"an horrendous scenario\" to contemplate that Jodie should struggle to drag Mary behind her, something which would have to hurt Mary. The real issue of difficulty for me lies in the judge's finding that the remaining few months of her life if not separated would \"be simply worth nothing to her, they would be hurtful\". This led him to conclude that \"to prolong Mary's life for these few months would be very seriously to her disadvantage\". Whether these remaining months will be hurtful or not is not the important question in this case. What is of real importance and public interest is the assessment that her life is worth nothing... The sanctity of life doctrine is so enshrined as a fundamental principle of law and commands such respect from the law that I am compelled to accept that each life has inherent value in itself however grave the impairment of some of the body's functions may be. I am satisfied that Mary's life, desperate as it is, still has its own ineliminable value and dignity. In my judgment the learned judge was wrong to find it was worth nothing. He also erred in his finding that to prolong Mary's life would be seriously to her disadvantage. He wrongly characterised the nature of the treatment. No treatment was here being proposed to prolong her life in the way [Hillsborough victim] Tony Bland's artificial support systems prolonged his. Surgery would amount to a positive act of invasion of her bodily integrity with no medical or other benefit flowing from it... In my judgment it cannot be in Mary's best interests to undergo surgery which will terminate her life. That places the court on the painfully sharp horns of dilemma. The court's duty is to put the welfare of each child paramount. It is in the best interests of Jodie that separation takes place; it is in the best interests of Mary that it does not. There is an irreconcilable conflict and the court cannot fully honour its separate duty to each child to do what is best for that child. In my judgment the only solution is to balance the welfare of each child against the other to find the least detrimental alternative. In my view the parents take an unduly pessimistic view of the prognosis for Jodie. Their personal hardship in coping with her with such disabilities as she will have to bear command great sympathy but the difficulties for the parents and the difficulties for Jodie cannot outweigh the right to life to which their child is entitled... So I have to balance the welfare of one child against the other. Into each scale goes their right to life. This right is universal: we all share it equally. The scales remain in balance. I am not entitled to value the quality of one human life as worth more than another's and I do not do so. But it is legitimate to look at the actual condition of the children as they are and assess their legitimate expectations when determining whether it is worth treating them. The worthwhileness of the proposed treatment is a legitimate factor to weigh. For the reasons given the treatment is not worthwhile for Mary for one cannot escape from the fact that Mary has always been fated for early death: her capacity to live has been fatally compromised. Though Mary has a right to life, she has little right to be alive. She is alive because and only because, to put it bluntly but nonetheless accurately, she sucks the lifeblood of Jodie and her parasitic living will soon be the cause of Jodie ceasing to live. Jodie is entitled to protest that Mary is killing her. Nobody but the doctors can help Jodie. Mary sadly is beyond any help. The best interests of the twins is to give the chance of life to the child whose actual bodily condition is capable of accepting the chance to her advantage even if that has to be at the cost of the sacrifice of a life which is so unnaturally supported. I am therefore left in no doubt at all that the scales come down heavily in Jodie's favour. I am wholly satisfied that the least detrimental choice is to permit separation to take place. But it remains subject to the analysis of whether the operation is lawful. Two features seem to me to be important. The first is that the doctors are placed under a legal duty to do what is best for their patient. That at once places them in a position of impossible conflict. They are under a duty to Mary not to operate because it will kill her but they are under an equally powerful duty to Jodie obliging them to operate because not to do so will kill this twin... In those circumstances it seems to me the law must allow an escape by permitting the doctors to choose the lesser of the two evils. The doctors must conduct their balancing exercise in the same way as the court has had to do. The answer is the same. There is a second reason why it seems to me that the proposed operation will not in any event offend the sanctity of life principle. This is not an absolute rule. It demands only that life is to be protected from unjust attack. In a joint statement by the Anglican and Roman Catholic bishops in the aftermath of Bland they stated that because human life is a gift from God to be preserved and cherished, the deliberate taking of human life is prohibited except in self-defence or in the legitimate defence of others. The archbishop defines the principle in terms that human life is sacred and inviolable so that one should never aim to cause an innocent person's death by act or omission. Helpless The reality here, harsh as it is to state it and unnatural as it is that it should be happening, is that Mary is killing Jodie. To label Mary as an \"unjust aggressor\" is wholly inappropriate for the sad and helpless position in which Mary finds herself. This unique happening cannot be said to be unlawful. But in my judgment it does not have to be unlawful. The six-year-old boy indiscriminately shooting all and sundry in the school playground is not acting unlawfully because he is too young for his acts so to be classified. In my judgment, however, and this is a judgment on a question of law, not morality - though, for what it is worth, I personally would think the position is the same - that child may be killed in legitimate self-defence. I see no difference in essence between that resort to self-defence and the doctors coming to Jodie's defence and removing the threat of fatal harm to her presented by Mary's draining her life blood. I conclude, therefore, that the operation can be lawfully carried out. The Human Rights Act 1998 looms over us. The rights it guarantees are as much in conflict with each other as the doctors' duties and I do not believe that the court in Strasbourg would come to any other conclusion. I would therefore dismiss the appeal but, lest it be thought that this decision could become authority for any wider proposition such as that a doctor can kill the patient once he has determined that a patient cannot survive, it is important to restate the unique circumstances for which this case is authority. They are that it must be impossible to preserve the life of X without bringing about the death of Y. That Y by his or her very continued existence will inevitably bring about the death of X within a short period of time and that X is capable of living an independent life but Y is incapable under any circumstances, including all forms of medical intervention, of viable independent existence. As I say at the beginning of my judgment this is a very unique case. Conjoined twins information sites: Twinstuff.com Conjoined twins",

More likely is a strong hint that November's green budget will include a freeze on duty, matching a pledge by the Liberal Democrats. Other tax and benefit changes are expected to be in short supply. Instead, Gordon Brown and Tony Blair will trumpet the 3.2% real increase in government spending, particularly on public services, and the booming economy. </p> <p>Whatever the chancellor announces, the Labour and Tory party conferences over the next two weeks will be true pre-election platforms which give voters a clearer idea of what will happen to the pound in their pocket. </p> <p>The Tories spent two days this week preparing their tax plans for the coming election. Little is known of the conclusions they reached, apart from the pledge to cut 3p off fuel, but their conference will be used to spell out some tax cuts and benefit changes designed to win over a public disillusioned with Labour. </p> <p>Shadow chancellor Michael Portillo has already said he won't spend more than the country earns. This limits Tory spending in its first year in office, presuming it wins the election, to an extra 2.25%. The figure is nearly a full percentage point less than Labour's spending plans, which one firm of accountants says implies a Tory spending cut of some \u00a312bn. Put another way, it suggests that Mr Portillo has \u00a312bn for possible tax cuts, but it's a figure he denies, and he scoffs at accusations that he will cut public services. Nevertheless, scaling back Labour spending to this extent would allow him to abolish capital gains tax, inheritance tax, beer and cider duties, air passenger duty and insurance premium tax in one go. </p> <p>Much of the Lib-Dems election agenda was spelled out in Bournemouth this week. It has become almost a cliche that if you like a dash of socialism with your martini, the LibDems are for you. So what are the parties promising for the pound in your pocket? Jobs &amp; Money sets out the party pledges below, but expect lots of shuffling ahead of a possible election next year. </p> <p><strong> Pensions</strong> Hopes that the Liberal Democrats would restore the link between the state pension and earnings were dashed. The party agreed to pump between \u00a35 and \u00a315 into the state pension should it win, but stepped back from a commitment to push it up every year in line with earnings. Pensioners moving through the 75 and 85 barriers will get extra payments and means-testing of savings will be abolished. </p> <p>The party also proposes a compulsory second pension \"that would guarantee a decent level of income for future pensioners\" and by that the party means people under 30 now. </p> <p>The Tories want to make life easier for pensioners, collapsing Labour's various benefit hikes into one single boost to the state pension. Longer term it wants to wean everyone off the state pension altogether, starting with the under 30s. Workers would be offered monthly cash top-ups to a personal pension in return for signing away their right to a state pension on retirement. Unfortunately, the amount of money on offer will not be disclosed until next month. </p> <p>Don't call it a privatisation, say the Tories, because it will not be compulsory. In the meantime, state pension rises will be higher than Labour, they say. </p> <p>On Thursday Gordon Brown countered with a Labour proposal that attempts to make more attractive the mix of flat rate state pension - \u00a367.50 for a single person - and means-tested benefits that most pensioners live with now. </p> <p>He repeated the offer made in the Budget of a pension credit. The government's aim is to persuade people on low to middle incomes to put their cash into a voluntary, second stakeholder pension. The pension credit, on a sliding scale, will allow them to keep their savings rather than them being offset against benefits. It will be complicated. The only simple aspect will be a minimum in come guarantee of \u00a382 from April next year that Mr Brown hinted he might raise to \u00a390 when he addresses the Labour conference. In contrast, one of Labour's main stealth taxes, the abolition of tax relief on dividend income, costs shareholders about \u00a36bn per year of which \u00a34.2bn is shouldered by pension funds. That's \u00a3200 more each worker must put in their pension fund each year to make up the difference. </p> <p><strong> Income - tax and benefits</strong> Labour trumpets the \u00a33.60 minimum wage, rises in child benefit and working families' tax credit which it says gurantees an income of \u00a3214 to a family with two children. On the other hand, most economists agree that higher rate taxpayers, especially those without children, have lost out. The \u00a324.7bn annual increase in the tax burden between 1996/97 and 2001/02 is equivalent to a rise of around 8p on the basic rate of tax. About 3p is accounted for by Labour tax hikes, 2p can be attributed to changes already imposed by the Tories and 3p from higher wages pushing people over the tax thresholds. </p> <p>The LibDems want to ditch Mr Brown's 10p tax rate and replace it with higher personal allowances, boosting them by around \u00a31,500. It reckons 1.4m people on low incomes will stop paying tax altogether. The scheme will be paid for with a new 50% tax band on incomes over \u00a3100,000. They also want to \"reconnect citizens with taxation\" with a citizen's tax contract that details how much tax has been raised and what it has been spent on. </p> <p>Conservative policy, by contrast, centres on tax cuts, though Mr Portillo famously retracted the \"year-on-year\" tax cutting pledge and replaced it with \"when it is affordable\". Income tax will be a target, along with Mr Brown's stealth taxes like petrol duty. The Tories want to ditch the New Deal in favour of a Britain Works and develop a more forceful scheme for the unemployed called Can Work Must Work that will seriously dent the income of refuseniks. </p> <p><strong> Savings and investments</strong> The Tories have made low savings levels a key issue, blaming Labour's decision to kill Peps and Tessas and introduce Isas for turning people off saving. The savings ratio, which measures savings as a proportion of income, is down by half. But critics argue this always happens in a boom period; people don't save when they feel secure, and is nothing to do with the products on offer. Labour reacted to demands for change at the last Budget when it extended the maximum \u00a37,000 limit for maxi versions of the Isa for another year. Calls for a simpli fication of the complex rules governing the Isa have gone unheeded. The maxi is a wrapper for a collection of investments including shares and unit trusts. The mini version is like a Tessa and holds cash. Mini Isas can only hold \u00a33,000 compared to the Tessa's \u00a35,000. There is a hint that some of Portillo's tax cuts will encourage saving and proposals to increase tax-free limits are likely. </p> <p>With an independent Bank of England setting interest rates, the monthly cost of a mortgage is unlikely to change much unless a pre-election spending spree by Labour is deemed inflationary and rates go up accordingly. A tax giveaway from the Tories could spark the same reaction. One of the few non-inflationary \"gifts\" a government can make is to increase the limits on tax-free saving, which is why the Tories find it attractive. People with lots of money to save are considered potential supporters. </p> <p><strong> Financial exclusion</strong> Strictly Labour turf. The party is almost certain to emphasise its plans for a universal bank and basic bank accounts for people on low incomes. The universal bank, which may operate through post offices, has met strong resistance in the banking community. Basic bank accounts without overdraft facilities have fared better. A couple of banks have launched products so far. </p> <p>But the struggle to resist the tide of niche marketing financial products is taxing the best brains in the Treasury. Banks want to put behind them days when they operated as an extension of the welfare state, offering accounts to all comers. Niche products address niche markets. Customers must now be the kind of people who will make the bank money and forcing them to provide decent services to people on low incomes is going to be an uphill task. </p> <p>The Libdems are sympathetic to the cause; the Tories have enjoyed highlighting the slow progress so far. </p> <p><strong>New Labour strategy</strong></p> <p>\u0095 With anything up to \u00a35bn more than he thought in the kitty, Gordon Brown can cut the basic rate of tax from 22p in his pre-election budget without disturbing his spending plans. </p> <p>\u0095 Massive spending on education, health, transport, the New Deal and possibly environmental causes. </p> <p>\u0095 Increase the scope of the working families tax credit. </p> <p>\u0095 Possible boost to children's tax credit (which replaced married couples allowance). </p> <p>\u0095 Increase tax free income for families under working families tax credit. </p> <p>\u0095 Blair wants to join the euro, but party deeply split. </p> <p><strong>Conservative strategy</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Wants to cut income tax and range of other taxes and duties that fall under heading of Gordon's stealth taxes - when affordable. </p> <p>\u0095 Cut 3p from petrol duty. </p> <p>\u0095 Cut tax on saving, not specific how and by how much. </p> <p>\u0095 Bring back married couples allowance boosting income of marrieds without children. </p> <p>\u0095 Increase state pension - not known by how much.

It promises \"lucrative financial opportunities for the novice and sophisticated investor.\" </p> <p>Those who bite are first sent glossy brochures - one including the line \"that one by one, the world's most renowned deposits of blue sapphire are running out or not running at all.\" The shortage message, although denied elsewhere, is a vital element of the WC sales patter. </p> <p>Potential customers are asked to return the free inquiry form and are then phoned - ostensibly from Geneva but actually from the Costa del Sol - by Windsor Cairns. </p> <p>The Windsor Cairns sapphire investment trail takes in half the world - from the mines in Sri Lanka, via Spain where the phone centre is located, to Geneva, the registered address, and then to the Florida base of the US entrepreneurs behind the secretive Swiss firm and thence to the Bahamas, the current domicile of Ms Jamie Duncannon who signs letters to customers, with a Geneva letter-heading. </p> <p>Avery Brooks, an American, is one of the individuals working on the Costa touting the scheme to British investors. He repeatedly tells prospects that he has a masters degree in finance but refuses to divulge the name of the college or university when asked. Brooks admits he has only been \"a few months\" in the gemstone business. But he is a tenacious salesperson. </p> <p>Here, we examine claims made by Windsor Cairns and compare that with what independent experts say both here and in Sri Lanka. </p> <p> <strong> Claim 1: </strong> Windsor Cairns offers a \"secured, tax-exempt investment\" which will \"safely realise returns of 50% or more annually.\" The investment, it adds, has seen a \"30-year bull market with no downside price correction.\" There are also charts showing how precious stones have soared in value. </p> <p> <strong> Counterclaim: </strong> There is no \"safe\" investment which returns 50% or more annually - independent financial advisers are at a loss to find any investment no matter what the risk that has regularly offered this much. Even if sapphires had advanced at half that pace, a \u00a31,000 purchase in 1970 would be worth more than \u00a31m now. </p> <p>Brooks says this claim is based on auction house returns which he cannot name and on \"figures from a previous company in this field\" which likewise remains anonymous. </p> <p> <strong> Claim 2: </strong> \"We're looking for political and economic factors. The demand for sapphires has never been greater. There are serious problems with the Tamil Tiger rebels in Sri Lanka; they declared a civil war in May and it's getting worse and worse by the day,\" says Brooks. Brooks says the civil war has caused disruption in the market place and this has led to \"tremendous volatility in markets\". </p> <p> <strong> Counterclaim: </strong> Sri Lankan news sources report clashes between the Tamil Tigers and government troops almost daily. Most result in heavy loss of life. But the Tamil activity is largely confined to the Jaffna peninsula in the island's north - the sapphire mines are in the south where there is no Tamil activity. The Sri Lanka gem and jewellery authority says the mines are unaffected. And the market is now receiving substantial supplies of quality stones from Madagascar. </p> <p> <strong> Claim 3: </strong> Sri Lanka produces \"the finest investment grade sapphires\". At the same time, Brooks says demand for sapphires has never been greater. </p> <p> <strong> Counterclaim: </strong> Just what this is based upon is unclear. Dr Roger Harding, director of London's respected Gemmological Association and Gem Testing Laboratory says there is no such thing as \"investment grade\" sapphires. He also doubts that demand is at an all-time high relative to supply. </p> <p> <strong> Claim 4: </strong> Brooks offers a 2 carat stone at \u00a34,025, a 1 carat \"museum\" quality stone at \u00a33,600, and a 0.75 carat stone at \u00a31,500. </p> <p> <strong> Counterclaim: </strong> Dr Harding says \"museum quality\" is a salesman's term not recognised in his industry. A US website - Simply Sapphires - sells pairs of 1 carat stones for $150 (around \u00a3110). </p> <p> <strong> Claim 5: </strong> Brooks appeals to the investor's greed by offering a \"tax-free\" gain. He tells prospective customers that to save VAT and import duties, the stones are kept sealed in plastic in a vault in Geneva Airport's tax-free zone. </p> <p>\"You can have physical delivery if you want but that will cost a lot more with further expenses when you want to sell. It is money that will be wasted from your profits. More than 99% of our customers use the Valimpex tax-free zone,\" he says. \"You also have a special international capital gains tax allowance,\" he adds. </p> <p> <strong> Counterclaim: </strong> It is true that if you never import the jewels, you do not pay duty and VAT. But there is no such thing as an international CGT allowance. Leaving them in a tax-free vault means you never see the stone so you cannot get an independent valuation. </p> <p> <strong> Claim 6:</strong> Brooks says sapphire investment is \"more liquid than unit trusts.\" </p> <p> <strong> Counterclaim: </strong> Unit trusts can be sold overnight for cash. Selling a gemstone could take months and there are charges. </p> <p>Dr Harding says investors should take all these claims with \"a pinch of salt.\" </p> <p>He says: \"Sapphires have done no more than keep up with inflation over the years and the prices quoted would have to be exceptional quality even for someone to spend time examing them. There have been periods in the past when offshore operations tried to sell stones which the purchaser would never see. In those cases, the stones turned out to be worth about a tenth of their sales price.\" </p> <p>The watchdog Financial Services Authority says Windsor Cairns is outside its jurisdiction and that investors who send cheques to unregulated concerns do so at their own risk. There is no comp- ensation scheme if they lose out. </p> <p>Other enforcement agencies admit they are powerless to act due to the way Windsor Cairns splits its functions across international borders. </p> <p>In a second phone call Brooks admits \"our published information is not indicative of the returns. There are a number of unscrupulous individuals in my market. This is not an investment, more a collectable that we keep in a tax-free zone.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Jamie Duncannon was not available for comment. </p> <p><strong>Shoot-first policy to cope with the cowboys</strong></p> <p>The Financial Services Authority says you should always check that a company is authorised before sending any money for an investment. Other ways to avoid trouble with cowboy firms include: </p> <p>\u0095 Insist on having all documentation before you sign or agree to anything. Read the small print. </p> <p>\u0095 Ask about cancellation rights - unless you are sure of these, use a post-dated cheque. Cancel the deal if it is not as you had expected. </p> <p>\u0095 Always print off a copy of the terms and conditions, if you are buying over the internet - the details on the website may have changed when you go back again. </p> <p>\u0095 Never rely on the advice of the sales person alone unless you are sure of the product's value from past experience. </p> <p>\u0095 Get independent advice if you do not understand the product or whether it suits you. </p> <p>\u0095 Check forms before signing, especially if someone else - a tele-operator, say - has filled them in for you. </p> <p>\u0095 Don't buy from a web site unless it gives an address and telephone number to contact if you have a problem - never trust a mobile number or a foreign one unless the firm has a UK office. </p> <p>\u0095 Remember that information about a product is not the same as advice. </p> <p>\u0095 Don't sign up to a deal unless you are completely happy with it. </p> <p>\u0095 Don't give an account number or credit card number unless you are actually in the process of making a purchase. Don't be taken in by requests for these details for \"security\" reasons. </p> <p>\u0095 Never give out bank account numbers or credit card details on the internet unless you are on a secure site. </p> <p>\u0095 Never divulge a PIN number to anyone. </p> <p>\u0095 The FSA says that it cannot offer any protection if people deal with offshore or unauthorised investments. </p> <p>\u0095 Question everything - if an offer sounds too good to be true, it nearly always is. </p> <p>\u0095 Phone the FSA hotline on 0845-606-1234 if you suspect something.</p>",

It's yes if you believe an offshore sales outfit working from the Costa del Sol, with a brass plate registration in Geneva and an ultimate owner currently residing in Florida. Over the past few weeks it has been heavily mailing potential UK investors. It's no , however, if you take notice of almost everyone else and heed warnings that virtually all of your capital could be at risk.

It is targeting the 7m people it dubs the UK's \"new affluents\". </p> <p>Credit Suisse's Global Investor Portfolio account, which goes live next month, will allow people to trade shares on 15 stock markets including London, New York and Frankfurt, hold cash in up to four currencies and buy unit trusts from leading-name companies. Personal fi nancial advice will be available to customers from next year. </p> <p>It's the sort of service that in the past would only have been available to extremely wealthy investors via traditional private banks or investment managers, but Credit Suisse says it will not be restricting the account to the seriously rich - it is targeting people with around \u00a330,000-plus of \"invested assets,\" and has set the minimum needed to open an account at \u00a3600. </p> <p>The numbers of so-called \"higher net worth\" individuals are expanding rapidly - Credit Suisse reckons that across Europe there are 40m of them - so it's no wonder that growing numbers of institutions are trying to find new ways to hook the newly wealthy. Earlier this year banking giant HSBC and stockbroker Merrill Lynch joined forces to launch a similar online banking and investment services company aimed at those with \"investable assets\" of \u00a360,000 to \u00a3300,000. The company is due to go live in the UK before the end of the year. </p> <p>So what can higher net worth individuals currently get for their money? And what about the millions of not-so-high net worth people with just a few thousand pounds to invest. What should they do? </p> <p> <strong> \u00a31,000:</strong> If this is all the savings/investment cash you've got, you're really looking at a bank or building society account. However, you don't have to put up with a derisory rate of interest, particularly if you're prepared to take to the internet. Nationwide building society's e-Savings account -operated online as part of its FlexAccount current account - pays 7% gross from \u00a31. </p> <p> <strong> \u00a33,000: </strong> You should be looking at putting some of this money into a cash Isa (you can invest up \u00a33,000 in one of these during the current tax year). </p> <p> <strong> \u00a35,000: </strong> \"At this point you can start looking at equity-linked Isas,\" says Maxine Harvey at Wolverhampton-based independent financial adviser Torquil Clark. These are often invested in unit trusts or investment trusts - funds into which investors pool their money so it can be invested on their behalf by a fund manager. However, first make sure you've got some rainy-day savings in a bank or building society account. </p> <p>Meanwhile, an account with private bank Cater Allen (part of the Abbey National group) can be opened with a minimum of \u00a35,000. Funds can be held in sterling, US dollars or euros. </p> <p> <strong> \u00a310,000:</strong> Those with this sort of amount will probably want to dabble further in stocks and shares Isas (you can invest up to \u00a37,000 this tax year), but may also want to look at a unit trust or an Oeic (open-ended investment company) on top, says Ms Harvey. For wealthier investors, basic portfolio management services start at around \u00a310,000 - Rothschild Asset Management will select funds for you and send half-yearly reports for a 1.5% annual fee. </p> <p> <strong> \u00a320,000: </strong> In addition to Isas and unit trusts/Oeics, you might want to stash some money away in something like a with-profits bond. These are offered by insurance companies, and your money is invested in a broad range of shares, gilts and property. They tend to be aimed at people with at least \u00a35,000 to invest and are very much a medium- to long-term investment that should be held for at least five years. A well-heeled investor with \u00a320,000 to play with may want to move up to directly held shares with an advisory investment service from a broker such as Killik &amp; Co. </p> <p> <strong> \u00a350,000:</strong> Once you've made full use of your Isa allowances, perhaps bought into a unit trust or two and maybe acquired an insurance company bond, you might want to start to think about some more diversification - perhaps into the US. </p> <p> <strong> \u00a3100,000: </strong> At this point you may well want to look at specialising further and investing more of your loot in a particular sector or going for something like the Classic Portfolio Service operated by Edinburgh Fund Managers - this is an actively managed \"fund of funds\" unit trust investing in funds from 20 of the biggest names, says Ms Harvey (it's aimed at people who have \u00a325,000-plus to invest). </p> <p> <strong> \u00a3100,000-\u00a3250,000:</strong> Private client territory. You might want to opt for a portfolio of directly held shares and overseas investments offered by brokers such as Prudential Bache or investment manager Quilter &amp; Co. Meanwhile, Cater Allen Offshore offers a discretionary portfolio management service for clients with \u00a3250,000-plus. </p> <p> <strong> \u00a3500,000:</strong> Minimum needed to become a client of Coutts, the Queen's bank, with bespoke \"wealth management services\": one-to-one meetings with an adviser, monthly reports and entry to hedge funds. </p> <p> <strong> \u00a31m:</strong> With a million to play with, accountants KPMG will offer you a tax and strategic investment service, setting up trusts and minimising tax liabilities, with a personal adviser based in Switzerland, the UK or US. </p> <p> <strong> \u00a310m: </strong> Rothschild Asset Management will set up a private unit trust. At this level you'll want your personal investment and tax adviser, who for \u00a3100,000 a year will manage your affairs day-to-day. </p> <p>\u0095 For more information about Credit Suisse's Global Investor Portfolio account log on to <a href=\"http://www.credit-suisse.net\">www.credit-suisse.net</a></p>",

You might want to opt for a portfolio of directly held shares and overseas investments offered by brokers such as Prudential Bache or investment manager Quilter &amp; Co. Meanwhile, Cater Allen Offshore offers a discretionary portfolio management service for clients with \u00a3250,000-plus. \u00a3500,000: Minimum needed to become a client of Coutts, the Queen's bank, with bespoke \"wealth management services\": one-to-one meetings with an adviser, monthly reports and entry to hedge funds. \u00a31m: With a million to play with, accountants KPMG will offer you a tax and strategic investment service, setting up trusts and minimising tax liabilities, with a personal adviser based in Switzerland, the UK or US. \u00a310m: Rothschild Asset Management will set up a private unit trust. At this level you'll want your personal investment and tax adviser, who for \u00a3100,000 a year will manage your affairs day-to-day. \u0095 For more information about Credit Suisse's Global Investor Portfolio account log on to www.credit-suisse.net",

Set in the early 1960s and transposed from Ireland to rural Northumberland, it tells the story of Bridie, who lives with her sick father on their farm.

But designer Neil Murray makes the best of the Playhouse, turning the vast stage into a space of undulating hills across which piled-up chairs snake like both physical and psychological debris. The space constantly transforms as the dancers trip across it: at one point the chairs slip down the slope like a landslide of letting go.

It makes you want to dance and cry. </p> <p>Like so much of director Alan Lyddiard's work, it has a diffuse quality: often, the important things are on the periphery. There are no big statements, only tiny gestures: a woman picking a hair off a man's suit, the men strutting. It takes the lives of ordinary people surviving on the margins and makes them seem special, almost blessed. There is an acuteness about this that is almost frightening, as if the emotion has somehow been distilled: the quickstep turned into a love letter, the foxtrot into a litany of rejection. The piece has a caged grace but it avoids sentimentality. Like Bridie, it has no use for tears. </p> <p>The play delves into folk memory and it reaches out across town and countryside.

Much of this is because local authorities have had to overhaul cremation facilities as environmental regulation becomes tighter. </p> <p>The average amount spent is just over \u00a32,000 for a burial and around \u00a31,200 for a cremation, according to Gilmour Research, but with so many variables, this depends on how grand the ceremony is. More than seven in 10 people choose cremation, but you can choose more than just the method of your disposal; cars, flowers and gardens of rememberance may all be bought. A spokesman from the Co-operative Funeral Service, which has more than 500 outlets nationwide, says: \"Funerals can be as simple or elaborate as people want them to be. We would always encourage people to think about their own funeral arrangements in advance as this lifts a significant emotional burden from their families.\" </p> <p>There is a huge range of costs depending on where death occurs. The average burial in London costs \u00a32,646, against \u00a31,741 in the north, or \u00a31,221 in Bristol, and while the average cost of a cremation in the capital is \u00a31,215, that goes down to \u00a3692 in Cardiff. The only areas which have seen a reduction in costs are the north-west and Yorkshire, where cremations are 8% cheaper than two years ago. </p> <p>The Manchester Unity Friendly Society, which publishes an independent survey on the cost of funerals, makes the point that many directors do not respond accurately to telephone enquiries. \"Only one funeral director gave the full price at the beginning when asked the cost of a basic funeral. Most directors did not mention that the \u00a3200-plus crematorium fee was not included in their quote: over the past 10 years we have found that people tend to hide the true costs.\" </p> <p>Its mystery shopping survey revealed that, for instance, for someone who has died in London, the average quote for a burial was \u00a31,131, whereas the actual cost was \u00a31,515, a difference of 34%. But the CFS spokesman says that his organisation always gives the true cost up front and any changes must be agreed upon in writing. It also provides its services free for funerals of children up to age 16, although associated costs will have to be paid. </p> <p>The invoice usually arrives two to three weeks after the ceremony and a \u00a340 discount is generally offered for settlement within 30 days. Most directors will be happy to wait until probate or insurance money comes through provided they are kept fully informed of progress. </p> <p><strong> Low-cost funeral</strong> The most basic funeral in Woolwich, south London, costs \u00a3950 from CFS. The same service costs \u00a3790 in Tredegar, Wales and \u00a3795 in Glasgow. This covers the cost of a wood veneer coffin but does not include what are called \"disbursements\": cremation or burial fees, doctors' fees and obituary notices, which typically add \u00a3400 to the above amount. </p> <p>The cheapest flowers available from the Funeral Shop website are pink and white sprays for \u00a340 or a black and white wreath for \u00a350, including VAT, postage and packing. Some will be eligible for money from the Department of Social Security. The maximum is \u00a3600 plus basic disbursements, and the claimant must be receiving social security payments, not have savings of more than \u00a3500 (or \u00a31,000 if they are over 60), and cannot claim if they have a brother or sister who has sufficient funds. </p> <p><strong> Expensive funeral</strong> The most pricey at the CFS's Woolwich branch costs \u00a32,195. For this the level of service is the same as for the basic funeral, but the coffin is more elaborate and will be made of solid oak or ash. However, the ceremony can be as expensive as you wish. The CFS will occasionally im port the Promethean coffin from the States, which is made of solid brass with gold trimmings and costs \u00a314,000. A horse-drawn hearse will add an additional \u00a3500 to the bill and a six-foot spray is \u00a3200, depending on the area. The most expensive coffin on the Funeral Shop website is the \u00a32,500 Last Supper Casket and a top-of-the-range wreath of red carnations is \u00a3115. Gardens of remembrance can be constructed featuring a bench (\u00a3100), a wooden armchair (\u00a375), a laurel sundial (\u00a360) or a patio set (\u00a3450). </p> <p><strong> Green funeral </strong> You may wish to opt for a more environmentally sound funeral. The Natural Death Centre in London gives advice on woodland burials, where the body is generally placed in a cardboard coffin and a tree is planted rather than a headstone. A burial of this type in Greenhaven, near Rugby, will cost \u00a3570 for the grave, the tree, a biodegradable coffin and collection of the body. The same service at Hinton Park, on the Hampshire-Dorset border, costs \u00a31,075. All of these sites allow you to organise the funeral independently, without the use of a director. This may be done by storing the body at home (the heating will have to be turned off, or dry ice may be used, costing \u00a327.48 from the British Oxygen Company on 020-8985-5544) and a nurse will lay out the body. Rent a transit van or estate car to transport the body and register the death yourself with the registrar of births, deaths and marriages. Doctors' certificates cost around \u00a382 and you can ask a priest or minister to preside over the service, or use of a humanist officiant, who will charge around \u00a385. Coffins start at \u00a345 for a chipboard model including delivery. You may opt to bury the body on your own land, although there are strict regulations governing this. </p> <p><strong> Buying a funeral</strong> Like-for-like funerals can vary by hundreds of pounds, so although it's not the best of times to do so, a ring-round is a good idea. Yellow Pages should list all the local directors. You should try to ensure they are members of the Funeral Ombudsman scheme. </p> <p> Make a list of items you want to be included before contacting a firm. This may include for a cremation: hearse, coffin, director's fees, removal, chapel of rest, family car, cremation fee, minister, casket and a doctor's certificate, and for a burial you would need to add the cost of a grave-digger, headstone and plot, and obviously replace the cremation fee with a burial fee. </p> <p>Make sure that you get an accurate quote.

      "body": "<p>If you're considering buying or selling a house this autumn, you'll be looking anxiously at the forecasts for property prices. Everyone agrees that there's a slowdown in the rate of increase and there are signs that in places prices have peaked and are beginning to slip into reverse. </p> <p>But the question is, what happens next? Will prices come to a gentle halt and stay at their present value? Or is the rollercoaster of the housing market only pausing briefly at the summit before plunging irresistibly downwards?</p> <p>The mortgage lenders say that even though house prices are faltering, they won't slump in the way that we saw in the past decade. This \"soft landing\" theory says that prices might fall slightly, but will soon stabilise and we won't see prices going into tailspin and the return of that Shetland pony rider of the apocalypse, negative equity.</p> <p>But is this optimistic outlook to be believed? And are the mortgage lenders and the estate agents the best judges of how people are likely to behave under pressure? Because in the end, whether prices stabilise or collapse will depend on hundreds of thousands of buying and selling decisions taken by ordinary punters like you and me.</p> <p>So how about asking the experts in human behaviour? How do psychologists interpret the way we make decisions about when to buy and sell property? And do they see any likelihood of homebuyers escaping the cycle of boom and bust?</p> <p>Well, the bad news for the mortgage lenders, who are pencilling in plans for \u00a3140bn in new lending next year, is that there seems to be little support among economic psychologists for the theory that house prices are set for a period of levelling off.</p> <p>\"There isn't any reason in principle why there shouldn't be stability in house prices, but it doesn't seem at all likely in practice,\" says Paul Webley, professor of economic psychology at the University of Exeter.</p> <p>A key reason why he believes that there will continue to be volatility in house prices is that it's a market in which most of the traders have little experience. Which means that if we only buy and sell every eight years or so, we're a bit like people who only gamble on the Grand National -perennially inexperienced punters who are easily influenced by whatever seems to be the consensus. And when there's a stampede, we're all likely to follow.</p> <p>Anyone looking for signs of the current psychological state of homebuyers, he says, should consider the variations in the attitudes of different generations. Veterans of the long decline in prices in the 90s will remain cautious. But people who have only been homeowners in the past few years, when prices have been rising, will have a more buoyant outlook and are likely to be ready to gamble on paying even higher prices.</p> <p>Cary Cooper, professor of psychology at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, sees a near future in which there will continue to be sharp rises and falls in property values.</p> <p>\"You can relate the housing market to fluctuations in prices of information technology shares, where people are trying to realise profit quickly. It becomes unpredictable and is very strongly influenced by the psychology of the times,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Whether it's from TV or newspapers, a communal perception about house prices begins to develop. There might be people who think their own house has been over-valued by increases and they might then decide it's time to sell and make what they can - and when trends begin, people follow.\"</p> <p>Much as families ended up panic buying during the petrol shortage, even though they knew it wasn't a good idea, he says that homebuyers can be pushed by a \"mixture of fear and insecurity\" into chasing the swings of the market, adding even more downward or upward pressure on prices.</p> <p>Professor Cooper also identifies the influence of a changing attitude to housing. The past 20 years, he says, has seen the rise in the idea of a house as a financial asset rather than as somewhere to live. And the more that people use housing as a form of speculative investment, the greater the risk of surges and collapses in value.</p> <p>Dr Guy Fielding, who lectures at the University of Oxford, also says that the psychology of how we buy and sell encourages a herd instinct rather than rational decision making.</p> <p>\"We don't make these decisions very often, and people are very influenced by rumour, gossip and what friends and relatives say, rather than any objective opinions. This type of behaviour amplifies trends very quickly.\"</p> <p>If the psychologists are right, and the house price rollercoaster is still in motion, we could be in for a bumpy ride.</p> <p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:coughlan_sean@hotmail.com\">coughlan_sean@hotmail.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "If you're considering buying or selling a house this autumn, you'll be looking anxiously at the forecasts for property prices. Everyone agrees that there's a slowdown in the rate of increase and there are signs that in places prices have peaked and are beginning to slip into reverse. But the question is, what happens next? Will prices come to a gentle halt and stay at their present value? Or is the rollercoaster of the housing market only pausing briefly at the summit before plunging irresistibly downwards? The mortgage lenders say that even though house prices are faltering, they won't slump in the way that we saw in the past decade. This \"soft landing\" theory says that prices might fall slightly, but will soon stabilise and we won't see prices going into tailspin and the return of that Shetland pony rider of the apocalypse, negative equity. But is this optimistic outlook to be believed? And are the mortgage lenders and the estate agents the best judges of how people are likely to behave under pressure? Because in the end, whether prices stabilise or collapse will depend on hundreds of thousands of buying and selling decisions taken by ordinary punters like you and me. So how about asking the experts in human behaviour? How do psychologists interpret the way we make decisions about when to buy and sell property? And do they see any likelihood of homebuyers escaping the cycle of boom and bust? Well, the bad news for the mortgage lenders, who are pencilling in plans for \u00a3140bn in new lending next year, is that there seems to be little support among economic psychologists for the theory that house prices are set for a period of levelling off. \"There isn't any reason in principle why there shouldn't be stability in house prices, but it doesn't seem at all likely in practice,\" says Paul Webley, professor of economic psychology at the University of Exeter. A key reason why he believes that there will continue to be volatility in house prices is that it's a market in which most of the traders have little experience. Which means that if we only buy and sell every eight years or so, we're a bit like people who only gamble on the Grand National -perennially inexperienced punters who are easily influenced by whatever seems to be the consensus. And when there's a stampede, we're all likely to follow. Anyone looking for signs of the current psychological state of homebuyers, he says, should consider the variations in the attitudes of different generations. Veterans of the long decline in prices in the 90s will remain cautious. But people who have only been homeowners in the past few years, when prices have been rising, will have a more buoyant outlook and are likely to be ready to gamble on paying even higher prices. Cary Cooper, professor of psychology at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, sees a near future in which there will continue to be sharp rises and falls in property values. \"You can relate the housing market to fluctuations in prices of information technology shares, where people are trying to realise profit quickly. It becomes unpredictable and is very strongly influenced by the psychology of the times,\" he says. \"Whether it's from TV or newspapers, a communal perception about house prices begins to develop. There might be people who think their own house has been over-valued by increases and they might then decide it's time to sell and make what they can - and when trends begin, people follow.\" Much as families ended up panic buying during the petrol shortage, even though they knew it wasn't a good idea, he says that homebuyers can be pushed by a \"mixture of fear and insecurity\" into chasing the swings of the market, adding even more downward or upward pressure on prices. Professor Cooper also identifies the influence of a changing attitude to housing. The past 20 years, he says, has seen the rise in the idea of a house as a financial asset rather than as somewhere to live. And the more that people use housing as a form of speculative investment, the greater the risk of surges and collapses in value. Dr Guy Fielding, who lectures at the University of Oxford, also says that the psychology of how we buy and sell encourages a herd instinct rather than rational decision making. \"We don't make these decisions very often, and people are very influenced by rumour, gossip and what friends and relatives say, rather than any objective opinions. This type of behaviour amplifies trends very quickly.\" If the psychologists are right, and the house price rollercoaster is still in motion, we could be in for a bumpy ride.

      "bodyText": "A helpful linesman from the former Soviet Union could prove hard to come by, but England will try to recapture the spirit of 1966 during next month's World Cup qualifier against Germany by wearing red shirts for the last match at the old Wembley stadium. Kevin Keegan is keen for his players to don the red jersey on October 7, not only because it was worn by England when they defeated West Germany to win the World Cup 34 years ago but also because his side beat Germany wearing those colours at Euro 2000. \"It's the right occasion for the red shirt,\" said the FA's executive director David Davies. Supporters will be encouraged to attend wearing red. Among the guests at the match will be the 1966 finalists Bobby Charlton, Franz Beckenbauer and Uwe Seeler. Lady Ramsey, the widow of England's then manager Sir Alf, has had to turn down her invitation. Meanwhile, the FA is leading a campaign to keep the existing transfer system. It is gathering support from leagues, clubs and federations across the European Union and will send signed statements calling for the retention of the system to Uefa next week. The FA wants fans to add their weight to the appeal. Supporters can email info@the-fa.org.",

Less critically, the Trud newspaper, owned by the Gazprom gas monopoly, notes that both men have a lot in common, an ardent desire to ''save the nation'' and restore Russian greatness. It talks of '' a rapprochement'' between a Russian president and one of the most bitter critics of modern Russia's development. US Election Russia has been thrust into the US election campaign with the Republicans publishing a 209-page denunciation of the Clinton administration's eight years of bungling policy towards Russia. ''There are no new facts nor sensations in the report,'' the pro-government Nezavisimaya Gazeta reports sniffily. ''It's just an electioneering document. The Republicans accuse their presidential opponent of establishing a relationship with the leadership of Russia. \"A corrupt leadership, the report's authors insist. The only leadership there was, the Democrats respond.'' The opposition Segodnya paper notes that the report's publication was brought forward from next July to be wielded as a campaign weapon. ''The report itself proves that Washington and Moscow are closer than ever before.'' Cosmonaut Dies The death at 65 years old of German Titov, the second man into space in 1961 after Yuri Gagarin, is featured in all the papers. ''He still holds the record as the youngest man in space - he flew when he was 25 - and has a crater on the moon named after him,'' the English language Moscow Times noted. Kremlin Media Clampdown The opposition Segodnya, part of the Vladimir Gusinsky media empire which the Kremlin is currently trying to tame, reports that a new ''rapid reaction group'' made up of spin doctors and secret policemen is being formed in the Putin administration to counter opposition media. The brainchild of Gleb Pavlovsky, a PR consultant and key Putin adviser, the unit is to specialise in character assassination, rapid rebuttal of inconvenient reporting, and blackmail to discourage critical coverage of government policy, the newspaper says, citing sources in the Kremlin.",

      "body": "<p>\u0095 Where is it? This year's Labour conference - and next year's, too - is held in Brighton. These days, conferences have become so large that only a few towns can cope with holding them. Blackpool used to be one of them - but New Labour crossed the town off the list.</p> <p>\u0095 When is it? The conference begins on Sunday afternoon, when Tony Blair holds a question-and-answer session. This is nominally with delegates, but Mr Blair will have more than half a mind on how his answers will go down with the electorate.</p> <p>\u0095 The conference ends on Thursday 28 September with a rendition of the red flag and - on past form - a barnstorming speech by John Prescott. The same day will bring the guest of the week: Nelson Mandela flies in to cheer up the party faithful.</p> <p>\u0095 Who's going? The 720 Labour party delegates expected to attend make up only a fraction of the 4,000- 5,000 people likely to turn up for at least part of the week. Trade Unions account for around 400 people, and MPs, MEPs, Members of the Scottish Parliament, peers, Welsh Assembly and National Policy Forum members make up another 700. On top of them come hundreds of journalists, lobbyists and exhibitors. Older Labour activists complain that they feel excluded at an event that increasingly resembles a trade fare.</p> <p>\u0095 The key moment will be Tony Blair's address to the conference. Last year, he abandoned staccato soundbites for a potent attack on what he called the \"forces of conservatism\" stalking Britain. This year he'll speak days after falling victim to those same forces in the petrol crisis. Will he cave in to popular demand for cheaper fuel, ride out the storm by pointing to Labour successes in other areas, or tackle the demonstrator's demands head on? How he handles the situation will say a lot about the nature of the next general election.</p> <p>\u0095 Expect other highlights to include Gordon Brown's speech. He too will have to respond to claims he should cut tax on fuel - but will also speak against the background of claims he lied over what he knew about donations to the Labour party.</p> <p>\u0095 The full agenda of the conference will be published on Sunday. With it will come a guide to the hundreds of events on the conference fringe. The petrol crisis will certainly be a talking point here - even if it is ignored on the floor of the conference itself.</p> <p>\u0095 Expect complaints about government policy from backbench Labour MPs worried that they may lose their seats - and their jobs - in a year's time. Watch out too for the vote on reform of the House of Lords - there is a good chance that conference will vote for a fully elected upper house, against Tony Blair's wishes.</p> <p>\u0095 No prizes for guessing the hate figure of the week. William Hague will come in for plenty of criticism - not least because focus groups show that mention of his name is more likely to deter people from voting Tory than encourage it.</p> <p>\u0095 Protest of the week will come from truck drivers who may try to blockade the conference to highlight the rising cost of fuel. Will they prove more effective than last year's demonstration by the Countryside Alliance? It filled the streets of Bournemouth with hunting horns and tweed, but left Labour policy unchanged.</p> <p>\u0095 Everyone will have their ears open to catch the song of the week: in 1997 Labour bopped to D-Ream's \"Things Can Only Get Better and last year Tony Blair entered the hall to give his speech to the sounds of Fatboy Slim's Praise You. With the Tories ahead in the polls, no doubt this year's choice will be a little more sombre.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Where is it? This year's Labour conference - and next year's, too - is held in Brighton. These days, conferences have become so large that only a few towns can cope with holding them. Blackpool used to be one of them - but New Labour crossed the town off the list. \u0095 When is it? The conference begins on Sunday afternoon, when Tony Blair holds a question-and-answer session. This is nominally with delegates, but Mr Blair will have more than half a mind on how his answers will go down with the electorate. \u0095 The conference ends on Thursday 28 September with a rendition of the red flag and - on past form - a barnstorming speech by John Prescott. The same day will bring the guest of the week: Nelson Mandela flies in to cheer up the party faithful. \u0095 Who's going? The 720 Labour party delegates expected to attend make up only a fraction of the 4,000- 5,000 people likely to turn up for at least part of the week. Trade Unions account for around 400 people, and MPs, MEPs, Members of the Scottish Parliament, peers, Welsh Assembly and National Policy Forum members make up another 700. On top of them come hundreds of journalists, lobbyists and exhibitors. Older Labour activists complain that they feel excluded at an event that increasingly resembles a trade fare. \u0095 The key moment will be Tony Blair's address to the conference. Last year, he abandoned staccato soundbites for a potent attack on what he called the \"forces of conservatism\" stalking Britain. This year he'll speak days after falling victim to those same forces in the petrol crisis. Will he cave in to popular demand for cheaper fuel, ride out the storm by pointing to Labour successes in other areas, or tackle the demonstrator's demands head on? How he handles the situation will say a lot about the nature of the next general election. \u0095 Expect other highlights to include Gordon Brown's speech. He too will have to respond to claims he should cut tax on fuel - but will also speak against the background of claims he lied over what he knew about donations to the Labour party. \u0095 The full agenda of the conference will be published on Sunday. With it will come a guide to the hundreds of events on the conference fringe. The petrol crisis will certainly be a talking point here - even if it is ignored on the floor of the conference itself. \u0095 Expect complaints about government policy from backbench Labour MPs worried that they may lose their seats - and their jobs - in a year's time. Watch out too for the vote on reform of the House of Lords - there is a good chance that conference will vote for a fully elected upper house, against Tony Blair's wishes. \u0095 No prizes for guessing the hate figure of the week. William Hague will come in for plenty of criticism - not least because focus groups show that mention of his name is more likely to deter people from voting Tory than encourage it. \u0095 Protest of the week will come from truck drivers who may try to blockade the conference to highlight the rising cost of fuel. Will they prove more effective than last year's demonstration by the Countryside Alliance? It filled the streets of Bournemouth with hunting horns and tweed, but left Labour policy unchanged. \u0095 Everyone will have their ears open to catch the song of the week: in 1997 Labour bopped to D-Ream's \"Things Can Only Get Better and last year Tony Blair entered the hall to give his speech to the sounds of Fatboy Slim's Praise You. With the Tories ahead in the polls, no doubt this year's choice will be a little more sombre.",

For the past three years, his signature collection, shown in New York, has won the hearts of women everywhere (women after a certain look - luxurious but simple, classic but eclectic) and the plagiarism of the high street. </p> <p>He has become the darling of the fashion world, backed by LVMH since 1997 and winning awards for womenswear and accessories. He has even been pronounced \"New York's dauphin of grungy, understated cool\" by American Vogue - not bad for a designer who, after a swift rise to fame following a degree at Parsons, was fired from Perry Ellis in 1995 for a collection that is said to have begun the whole grunge trend. </p> <p>This month, Jacobs has produced a mainline collection for spring/ summer 2001, opened a menswear store in New York and introduced a secondary clothing line, Marc. In three weeks, he will roll out his latest looks at Louis Vuitton. A busy man, but strangely unassuming. \"I don't think I'm at all influential,\" he says. \"I don't understand it. I'm not being modest. I'm just a hard worker.\" </p> <p>The morning after the shop opening party, Jacobs is holed up in his suite at the Mercer Hotel in SoHo. In five hours, he will deliver the new Marc line, intended to complement his existing range but also to address a new, younger, funkier customer. </p> <p>We meet in the lobby for coffee. His hair is fluffy and he runs back to his room for a sweater. He's sweet and reserved and shy. Get him on his specialist subject, though, and he swings into gear pretty quickly. </p> <p>\"I don't think my approach to design is that different. True, I don't talk about the sky in India being my inspiration or creating a fantasy. I get criticised for that sometimes, for being unimaginative or uncreative, but that's fine because those are two words I find very difficult anyway. I just like to be, and I like to do. I don't think you should have to validate a garment by saying what inspired it. If someone is wearing it, it's valid.\" </p> <p>But like it or not, his style has become definitive. Take the jeans - reinventing something held to be naff has become his trademark prank. </p> <p>\"It's always kind of fun to embrace something awful,\" he laughs. \"When I did the grunge collection, we showed Converse sneakers in duchess satin, Birkenstocks with $5,000 pleated dresses I'd cut the hems off. It wasn't to be rebellious, it was the discord of the whole thing I loved - and still do.\" </p> <p>This skewed way of looking at fashion extends into every area of his life. \"Some of my favourite objects are inspired by things that aren't valued. There's a tumbler at Tiffany designed by Elsa Perretti. It's in beautiful, elegant crystal but Elsa maintains it was inspired by a Dixie cup - you know, those classic little disposable cups worth two cents a piece. I find real comfort in things that are familiar and banal. I like to elevate garments by putting them in beautiful fabrics.\" </p> <p>Jacobs' mainline collection, shown last week, was quite a departure from his past two which sparked the prim look of the late 90s. This season was sexier, more energetic. You couldn't help but know he'd relaxed with it, had fun with the bright spaghetti-strapped dresses wrapped with wide leather belts with huge diamant\u00e9 buckles. \"The past couple of seasons, I stopped getting excited about fashion, it became a formula. It felt like we were starting over again this season. It hadn't been much fun; now it is.\" </p> <p>The new Marc collection, complete with ironed jeans, continues Jacobs' passion for \"embracing the awful\". There are clear plastic bomber jackets, hot pink ra-ra skirts, bobby socks with court shoes and those funny elastic belts with plastic clasps we loved, then learned to hate. There are also super-fine cashmere T-shirts, classic canvas trenchcoats, elegant single-breasted jackets and wispy chiffon skirts. Put it together and suddenly what was once scarily familiar from your childhood has a new context, a new status. </p> <p>\"I have not reinterpreted these wacky ideas into luxury fabrics,\" Jacobs says. \"I have elevated them and given them a new time. There is still the right creased jean and the wrong creased jean. We found a pair in a thrift shop that had obviously been worn and worn, ironed and ironed, so the idea was to recreate them.\" </p> <p>But while the challenge of making it work on the catwalk is one thing, the challenge of wearing it is quite another. Wouldn't your average woman in a Lurex-threaded jacket look less Joe Cool, more Joan Collins? </p> <p>\"There is a certain type of girl who can pull off this look. She is self- assured, with a frivolous side. Sexy but edgy, comfortable in her own skin.\" </p> <p>Five hours later, the appreciation of Jacobs' new Marc line is evident among the gathered fashion elite. Backstage, the girls are begging to keep their outfits - a sure sign that the collection will be a hit. </p> <p>\"All the girls love it.\" Jacobs smiles. \"At the fittings, [Brazilian model] Ana Claudia was running up and down shouting: 'I want all the T-shirts, I want all the shoes, I have to have the jeans.' It sounds terrible but all those models who wear all those fantastic clothes on all those runways, if they like something, well, then I'm happy. I don't design clothes to sit in a closet. I make clothes for people to wear. </p> <p>\"If I were Ana Claudia,\" he adds, \"if I were going to New York and London and Milan and Paris, I'd be sick to death of clothes. I wouldn't want those jeans if they could walk on their own.\" I, on the other hand, ordered two pairs.</p>",

Solicitors for the parents and Mary were given permission to appeal to the House of Lords.</p> <p>Earlier today, one of the judges had described the decision as an \"excruciating dilemma\".</p> <p>Lord Justice Alan Ward commented on the immense problems posed by the case as he arrived at the London court today and said he believed it was inevitable the decision he and his fellow two judges would eventually make would split the nation.</p> <p>Lord Justice Ward said: \"It has been excruciatingly difficult. One's heart bleeds for the family.

      "bodyText": "Conjoined twins Jodie and Mary, who both faced death if they were not separated by surgeons, must be operated on, the court of appeal ruled today. In a dramatic and long-awaited decision, the three judges sitting in London said doctors should go ahead with the procedure to divide the pair. The operation will condemn \"unviable\" Mary to an almost certain death but save the life of the healthier Jodie. Their devout Roman Catholic parents from the Mediterranean island of Gozo, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had asked the three judges to overturn a high court ruling last month giving surgeons the go-ahead for the operation. But after more than three days of deliberation, they disagreed with the parents and upheld the court's ruling. Solicitors for the parents and Mary were given permission to appeal to the House of Lords. Earlier today, one of the judges had described the decision as an \"excruciating dilemma\". Lord Justice Alan Ward commented on the immense problems posed by the case as he arrived at the London court today and said he believed it was inevitable the decision he and his fellow two judges would eventually make would split the nation. Lord Justice Ward said: \"It has been excruciatingly difficult. One's heart bleeds for the family. Fifty per cent of the population will agree with the decision - 50% will think we have gone potty,\" he said. Doctors admit the operation to separate the two children is bound to result in the death of \"unviable\" Mary, but say it could save healthier Jodie and offer her the chance of a full life. In an unprecedented recent hearing which drew worldwide attention, Lord Justice Ward, sitting in the appeal court with Lord Justice Brooke and Lord Justice Robert Walker, starkly said the court had been asked to decide: \"Do we save Jodie by murdering Mary?\" The case raised for the first time ethical and moral questions which could have a profound impact on the law, particularly with regard to unlawful killing. Critics have already suggested it could provide a way of introducing euthanasia in such tragic cases \"by the back door\". The twins, given false names to protect their identity, were born at St Mary's hospital, Manchester, on August 8, after their parents, who are from a Mediterranean community, came to England to give them the best chance of survival. Following the births, the parents took advice from friends and a priest and decided that separating the twins was \"not God's will\" and nature should take its course, even if that meant the loss of both children. All sides agreed that Mary will have a short existence. She has just a primitive brain and lives only because she is attached to her \"bright and alert\" sister and relies on her heart and lung functions to oxygenate her blood. The court was originally told doctors expected both would die within six months without the operation. But during the hearing new evidence raised \"the horrible spectre\" that they could survive longer, possibly for years, joined together with Mary slowly draining away Jodie's life until both died. However an emotional plea was made to the court by the Archbishop of Westminster for \"innocent\" Mary to be allowed to live out her tragic existence. The Most Rev Cormac Murphy-O'Connor said Mary possessed the same \"basic worth and dignity\" of every human being, adding: \"She has done nothing which could justify killing her\". He rejected the argument that Mary's horrific disabilities made her life \"futile\". He argued the wishes of the parents, who had the best interests of both children equally at heart, should be respected, and the family should be allowed to leave the country, if necessary, and take up an offer of care in Italy.",

Madness on all counts - socially, politically, financially.</p> <p>The trouble is that 75p, branded on the soul of every party member. They won't be cheered by a dismal Help the Aged Mori poll showing the pensioner vote swinging further and faster against Labour. How could Gordon have sent Labour out naked on to the doorsteps with nothing but these pathetic pennies in their hands?</p> <p>It will be blazoned on every opposition election leaflet: \"Remember the 75p!\" Why, they ask, didn't the iron chancellor bend and finesse a bit to get it over \u00a31? But it will be sorted because it has to be. Everyone knows that. The chancellor can only wink and nod in his conference speech, but it will be done.</p> <p>There are plenty of ways to do it. Next April inflation will lift the pension by \u00a32, then he can roll up the \u00a3150 winter fuel sum and \u00a310 christmas bonus. On top of that he could add another \u00a31 with the plausible excuse that it will compensate those who will have to pay tax on what was tax-exempt income.</p> <p>This amounts to \u00a36, a goodly sum - and he still hasn't broken the principle that the pension only rises with prices. Meanwhile the poorest are lifted off the floor by the minimum income guarantee (MIG), a system already costing more that restoring the old link.</p> <p>What will the Tories do? They say with glee that they will promise more on the basic pension than whatever the chancellor pays. On present form they could even offer to restore the earnings link. (They are not absolutely ruling it out.) After all, they swore no fuel tax cuts, yet six days later promised one. Their heartland better-off pensioners would be thrilled. It's a natural Tory policy. They are pledged not to keep the MIG's automatic uprating: cutting help to the poorest is the obvious Tory choice, widening inequality where Labour seeks to narrow it. The Tories' first attempt at a pensions policy promising \u00a35.50 on the basic pension was brutally exposed when it turned out to be just 42p new money, gained by cutting the social fund for the destitute and lone parent benefits. They will need something more.</p> <p>Can Labour hold the line? As usual the problem is that \"restore the link\", like \"petrol tax cuts now\" is a simple, comprehensible, popular cry. The government is doing the right thing but it isn't soundbite or billboard friendly. Labour's policies for the poor are a pig to explain even in acres of newsprint, let alone in a 20-second news bite. (Should I describe the new pensioner credit to help those above MIG but below income tax? Very good, very complex.)</p> <p>Will Labour delegates choose a good doorstep winner over a decently redistributive policy? That is the case Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling will have to make. A conference vote to restore the link would be a damaging embarrassment, especially if it is won on union votes. Who needs this?</p> <p>Lady Castle says she is fighting the monstrous iniquity of means testing. But if you want to give money to the poor, you have to find them first. She wants this degrading process abandoned. But how? Beveridge never managed to do it. Right from the start of national insurance the universal pension was never big enough to reach the income support (then national assistance) threshold.</p> <p>No one was ever expected to be able to live on the pension alone. That meant that anyone with only the basic pension always had to be means tested and topped up.</p> <p>The basic pension is now \u00a367.50. Age Concern reckons that pensioners need a minimum of \u00a390: half of all pensioners currently live on less. Do Castle and Jones really want to waste all that on the top third who are well-off? It would cost \u00a311.25bn - money that could lift huge numbers of children and pensioners out of poverty instead. And even if the basic pension rose to \u00a390, the poor would still be means tested for housing benefit.</p> <p>The great downside of means testing is that some pensioners don't claim it, maybe 500,000. Too proud, says Castle. Not so. Research evidence suggests most are claiming some benefits but not all, a question of ignorance of their rights. MIG is no more charity than the state pension, whose variable rate is wholly dependent on the largesse of the chancellor of the day. The government is doing well in its attempt to find the missing claimants: nearly 400,000 have responded to advertising to reach them. Barbara Castle is a fine old thing, brain sharp as mustard. She has the wit to change her mind if she chooses. It was she who first indexed pensions to earnings, but it lasted a short time before Mrs Thatcher broke the link - a folk memory burned deep in Labour mythology. Times change. Universal pensions are not a leftwing idea.</p> <p>Castle should throw her campaigning weight behind the cause of the poor, not a dead old idea of a national insurance principle that never actually delivered. She might extract a rich bribe for the poor pensioners: there is plenty to campaign for as MIG hasn't delivered much yet - only \u00a35.45 extra.</p> <p>That is more than double what they would have had if the earnings link had been restored, but \u00a378.45 is still not nearly enough to live on (despite Lord Falconer's claim that he could). The chancellor hasn't spent much on MIG yet: now is the time to extract a promise. Why not hit Age Concern's \u00a390 minimum in April and promise a \u00a3100 minimum for every pensioner for 2002? That would be socialism - and it is affordable.</p> <p>There is one quite good reason to restore the earnings link: it might help to win the election. But remember, this is panic week and not a good time to plunge off in frantic pursuit of elusive popularity. Let the Tories do that, they may pay the price for their frivolity eventually.</p> <p>In the end, voters will just have to decide whether they trust that beneath this recent fit of surface floundering, Labour has a solid, methodical, well-designed set of policies that will work, eventually. Alas, trust is all they have to go on, since so much will still be invisible at the election.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

It will be blazoned on every opposition election leaflet: \"Remember the 75p!\" Why, they ask, didn't the iron chancellor bend and finesse a bit to get it over \u00a31? But it will be sorted because it has to be. Everyone knows that. The chancellor can only wink and nod in his conference speech, but it will be done. There are plenty of ways to do it. Next April inflation will lift the pension by \u00a32, then he can roll up the \u00a3150 winter fuel sum and \u00a310 christmas bonus. On top of that he could add another \u00a31 with the plausible excuse that it will compensate those who will have to pay tax on what was tax-exempt income. This amounts to \u00a36, a goodly sum - and he still hasn't broken the principle that the pension only rises with prices. Meanwhile the poorest are lifted off the floor by the minimum income guarantee (MIG), a system already costing more that restoring the old link. What will the Tories do? They say with glee that they will promise more on the basic pension than whatever the chancellor pays. On present form they could even offer to restore the earnings link. (They are not absolutely ruling it out.) After all, they swore no fuel tax cuts, yet six days later promised one. Their heartland better-off pensioners would be thrilled. It's a natural Tory policy. They are pledged not to keep the MIG's automatic uprating: cutting help to the poorest is the obvious Tory choice, widening inequality where Labour seeks to narrow it. The Tories' first attempt at a pensions policy promising \u00a35.50 on the basic pension was brutally exposed when it turned out to be just 42p new money, gained by cutting the social fund for the destitute and lone parent benefits. They will need something more. Can Labour hold the line? As usual the problem is that \"restore the link\", like \"petrol tax cuts now\" is a simple, comprehensible, popular cry. The government is doing the right thing but it isn't soundbite or billboard friendly. Labour's policies for the poor are a pig to explain even in acres of newsprint, let alone in a 20-second news bite. (Should I describe the new pensioner credit to help those above MIG but below income tax? Very good, very complex.) Will Labour delegates choose a good doorstep winner over a decently redistributive policy? That is the case Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling will have to make. A conference vote to restore the link would be a damaging embarrassment, especially if it is won on union votes. Who needs this? Lady Castle says she is fighting the monstrous iniquity of means testing. But if you want to give money to the poor, you have to find them first. She wants this degrading process abandoned. But how? Beveridge never managed to do it. Right from the start of national insurance the universal pension was never big enough to reach the income support (then national assistance) threshold. No one was ever expected to be able to live on the pension alone. That meant that anyone with only the basic pension always had to be means tested and topped up. The basic pension is now \u00a367.50. Age Concern reckons that pensioners need a minimum of \u00a390: half of all pensioners currently live on less. Do Castle and Jones really want to waste all that on the top third who are well-off? It would cost \u00a311.25bn - money that could lift huge numbers of children and pensioners out of poverty instead. And even if the basic pension rose to \u00a390, the poor would still be means tested for housing benefit. The great downside of means testing is that some pensioners don't claim it, maybe 500,000. Too proud, says Castle. Not so. Research evidence suggests most are claiming some benefits but not all, a question of ignorance of their rights. MIG is no more charity than the state pension, whose variable rate is wholly dependent on the largesse of the chancellor of the day. The government is doing well in its attempt to find the missing claimants: nearly 400,000 have responded to advertising to reach them. Barbara Castle is a fine old thing, brain sharp as mustard. She has the wit to change her mind if she chooses. It was she who first indexed pensions to earnings, but it lasted a short time before Mrs Thatcher broke the link - a folk memory burned deep in Labour mythology. Times change. Universal pensions are not a leftwing idea. Castle should throw her campaigning weight behind the cause of the poor, not a dead old idea of a national insurance principle that never actually delivered. She might extract a rich bribe for the poor pensioners: there is plenty to campaign for as MIG hasn't delivered much yet - only \u00a35.45 extra. That is more than double what they would have had if the earnings link had been restored, but \u00a378.45 is still not nearly enough to live on (despite Lord Falconer's claim that he could). The chancellor hasn't spent much on MIG yet: now is the time to extract a promise. Why not hit Age Concern's \u00a390 minimum in April and promise a \u00a3100 minimum for every pensioner for 2002? That would be socialism - and it is affordable. There is one quite good reason to restore the earnings link: it might help to win the election. But remember, this is panic week and not a good time to plunge off in frantic pursuit of elusive popularity. Let the Tories do that, they may pay the price for their frivolity eventually. In the end, voters will just have to decide whether they trust that beneath this recent fit of surface floundering, Labour has a solid, methodical, well-designed set of policies that will work, eventually. Alas, trust is all they have to go on, since so much will still be invisible at the election. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Gordon Brown, last night launched a dramatic political fightback by unveiling new promises to help pensioners designed to avert a humiliating defeat at next week's party conference. However, a draft national executive statement agreed yesterday fails to restore the link between the basic state pension and earnings, the key demand of many pensioner activists and unions. The statement commits the government to increasing the guaranteed minimum income for pensioners next April, with a strong hint that it could rise to \u00a390, a \u00a312 increase on the present minimum. But this will not satisfy campaigners who want the basic pension to rise in line with earnings and the issue threatens to dominate the party conference. The chancellor made his move as part of a concerted effort to re-establish his authority after accusations that he mishandled reaction to the fuel crisis and lied over his knowledge of a \u00a31m grant to the Labour party by Bernie Ecclestone, the formula one boss. In a dramatic and often tense Channel 4 live interview, Mr Brown repeatedly insisted that he had not lied during a BBC interview almost three years ago when he said he did not know the true position over the Ecclestone donation. Mr Brown also insisted last night that he would not cave into demands for cuts in fuel tax imposed by pickets or artifical deadlines. The pensions move came as an opinion poll for Help the Aged showed the swing in satisfaction away from the government was 20% among the over 64s, compared with 8.5 % in the population at large. \"Britain's older voters have the potential to make a decisive impact on the next general election. Those aged over 64 are potentially four times as powerful a group as younger voters aged 18-24,\" Help the Aged said. \"They are twice as likely to vote and there are twice as many of them.\" Mr Brown said last night: \"We can't go back to the earnings link. What we must do is help the poorest pensioners and people on modest incomes, in many cases by more than the earnings link.\" Despite widespread anger over this year's 75p increase in the basic state pension, Mr Brown and the social security secretary, Alistair Darling, insisted they would focus extra spending on the poorest pensioners and those with limited savings or occupational pensions who lose out from means testing. A meeting of Labour's economic commission agreed a three-page draft statement, drawn up by Mr Brown and Mr Darling, to be put before the party conference. It commits the government to raising the minimum income guarantee in April next year and in a clear signal of the target to be adopted \"welcomes\" a call by the social security committee's for a \u00a390 a week minimum. The current minimum income guarantee is \u00a378.60. However, the commission set no deadline.

Barry Cook, managing director at D'Arcy, which handles the advertising for some of the UK's biggest spenders including Mars, Procter &amp; Gamble and Fiat, also welcomed the move.</p> <p>He said: \"It's a win, win situation. The concession ITV has secured from the ITC in return for moving the news back to 10pm is an increase in peak minutage from 37 to 40 per day - which means greater opportunity to buy into Coronation Street, Peak Practice etc. This helps all of our clients. For clients targeting ABC audiences like financial services, the return of News at Ten gives a focal point to their viewing.\" </p> <p>Mike Moran, commercial director at Toyota, which spends \u00a320m a year advertising on TV, said: \"On balance this is good news. What we have now is a very different proposition with lots of flexibility. The increase in minutage may not sound like much but what it means in reality is another 30-second spot in Coronation Street, for example, which delivers between 15m and 18m viewers.</p> <p>\"If there is anything that ITV can be criticised for it is not doing much with the schedule since News at Ten moved to the later slot. It had done a poor job at exploiting the new time, it was not in a strong position when these talks began and its had to take a defensive stance.\"</p> <p>However, the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers (ISBA), the voice of British advertisers in the UK, has given a more mixed reaction.Ian Twinn, public affairs director at ISBA, said: \"The good news is that we are now further forward than we were 18 months ago. The increase in minutage and the opportunities for flexible scheduling are something we very much welcome and what we have consistently asked for. </p> <p>\"The bad news for advertisers is that the viewing figures for News at Ten before the switch to the later slot were draining away. Advertisers pay for ITV, they are the funders and if people are switching off that's a big concern.\"</p> <p>Other industry figures, meanwhile, continue to support Howell's view. Mick Desmond, chief executive at sales house Granada Enterprises, called ITV's decision a win-win situation for all parties. Desmond, who worked closely with the ITV, the ITC and Carlton on the News at Ten issue, said: \"It's a big concession and a big win for everyone. The advertisers and agencies I've already spoken to have said they see the move as very positive, and a shrewd move for ITV,\" he said. </p> <p>He said there would be an instant impact on terrestrial broadcaster commercial revenues given that they will get an additional three minutes of ad slots during prime time. Desmond added that the pressure would now shift to the BBC and its mooted plans to move the Nine O'Clock News to 10pm.</p> <p> \"There's going to be a huge political lobby to persuade the BBC against this move because the last thing everyone wants is a head-to-head on drama and sport at 9pm. We'll join this and lobby hard to try to get the BBC to change its mind.</p> <p>Andy Farwell, sales director at sales house TSMS, said the decision was a good move for ITV, adding that it gave the network increased flexibility and the right to move the news around. </p> <p>He said: \"The 22:15 slot always used to be a highly sought after commercial spot with car advertisers using it to break their ad campaigns. That's changed over the past few years because of the growth in the number of multichannel homes, meaning that audiences for flagship news programmes has declined.\" </p>",

The concession ITV has secured from the ITC in return for moving the news back to 10pm is an increase in peak minutage from 37 to 40 per day - which means greater opportunity to buy into Coronation Street, Peak Practice etc. This helps all of our clients. For clients targeting ABC audiences like financial services, the return of News at Ten gives a focal point to their viewing.\" Mike Moran, commercial director at Toyota, which spends \u00a320m a year advertising on TV, said: \"On balance this is good news. What we have now is a very different proposition with lots of flexibility. The increase in minutage may not sound like much but what it means in reality is another 30-second spot in Coronation Street, for example, which delivers between 15m and 18m viewers. \"If there is anything that ITV can be criticised for it is not doing much with the schedule since News at Ten moved to the later slot. It had done a poor job at exploiting the new time, it was not in a strong position when these talks began and its had to take a defensive stance.\" However, the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers (ISBA), the voice of British advertisers in the UK, has given a more mixed reaction.Ian Twinn, public affairs director at ISBA, said: \"The good news is that we are now further forward than we were 18 months ago. The increase in minutage and the opportunities for flexible scheduling are something we very much welcome and what we have consistently asked for. \"The bad news for advertisers is that the viewing figures for News at Ten before the switch to the later slot were draining away. Advertisers pay for ITV, they are the funders and if people are switching off that's a big concern.\" Other industry figures, meanwhile, continue to support Howell's view. Mick Desmond, chief executive at sales house Granada Enterprises, called ITV's decision a win-win situation for all parties. Desmond, who worked closely with the ITV, the ITC and Carlton on the News at Ten issue, said: \"It's a big concession and a big win for everyone. The advertisers and agencies I've already spoken to have said they see the move as very positive, and a shrewd move for ITV,\" he said. He said there would be an instant impact on terrestrial broadcaster commercial revenues given that they will get an additional three minutes of ad slots during prime time. Desmond added that the pressure would now shift to the BBC and its mooted plans to move the Nine O'Clock News to 10pm. \"There's going to be a huge political lobby to persuade the BBC against this move because the last thing everyone wants is a head-to-head on drama and sport at 9pm. We'll join this and lobby hard to try to get the BBC to change its mind. Andy Farwell, sales director at sales house TSMS, said the decision was a good move for ITV, adding that it gave the network increased flexibility and the right to move the news around. He said: \"The 22:15 slot always used to be a highly sought after commercial spot with car advertisers using it to break their ad campaigns. That's changed over the past few years because of the growth in the number of multichannel homes, meaning that audiences for flagship news programmes has declined.\"",

      "byline": "Derek Brown",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Reverend William McCrea's victory in the South Antrim byelection is a severe blow not only to First Minister David Trimble, but to the power-sharing peace process. </p> <p>McCrea, who was MP for Mid-Ulster from 1983 to 1997, when he was beaten by Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, scraped back to parliament by just 822 votes in a low turn-out. But the victory of the Democratic Unionist party candidate ominously underlines the divisions in Ulster unionism, and the general lack of enthusiasm in the loyalist community for the Good Friday peace agreement. </p> <p>The result was also a victory for reaction and deep-died conservatism. McCrea has been roistering around the wilder fringes of unionism since the early 1970s. An ordained minister, he has always been a stalwart supporter of Reverend Ian Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party and perennial thorn in the flesh of would-be peacemakers. </p> <p>The new MP is a fundamentalist, both political and religious. He is Ireland's best known gospel singer, specialising in a curious blend of saccharine assurances of God's love, and blood-and-thunder warnings of divine wrath against unbelievers. </p> <p>At campaign meetings in the 1970s, when this reporter was covering Northern Ireland, he had a habit of breaking into his own speeches by grabbing a guitar and warbling the praises of the Lord. He has a distinctive quavering, high-pitched delivery well-suited to the evangelistic pulpit, but slightly disconcerting on the political stump. </p> <p>\"The only answer to Ulster's problems,\" he used to proclaim, his voice rising to a crescendo, \"is THE ROPE!\" </p> <p>But McCrea, and all that he represents, has to be taken extremely seriously. The DUP victory in what was once a super-safe seat for the Ulster Unionists, casts a long shadow over the power-sharing executive in Belfast. </p> <p>The byelection could not have been worse timed for Trimble, who must preside over his party's annual conference next month. Almost certainly, he will be challenged - again - for the leadership, by one of the rightwingers chafing against power-sharing. </p> <p>The first minister will be looking to Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson for concessions, to prop up his suddenly precarious hold on his own party. What he would dearly love would be postponement, or better still cancellation, of plans to reform the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

      "bodyText": "Reverend William McCrea's victory in the South Antrim byelection is a severe blow not only to First Minister David Trimble, but to the power-sharing peace process. McCrea, who was MP for Mid-Ulster from 1983 to 1997, when he was beaten by Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, scraped back to parliament by just 822 votes in a low turn-out. But the victory of the Democratic Unionist party candidate ominously underlines the divisions in Ulster unionism, and the general lack of enthusiasm in the loyalist community for the Good Friday peace agreement. The result was also a victory for reaction and deep-died conservatism. McCrea has been roistering around the wilder fringes of unionism since the early 1970s. An ordained minister, he has always been a stalwart supporter of Reverend Ian Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party and perennial thorn in the flesh of would-be peacemakers. The new MP is a fundamentalist, both political and religious. He is Ireland's best known gospel singer, specialising in a curious blend of saccharine assurances of God's love, and blood-and-thunder warnings of divine wrath against unbelievers. At campaign meetings in the 1970s, when this reporter was covering Northern Ireland, he had a habit of breaking into his own speeches by grabbing a guitar and warbling the praises of the Lord. He has a distinctive quavering, high-pitched delivery well-suited to the evangelistic pulpit, but slightly disconcerting on the political stump. \"The only answer to Ulster's problems,\" he used to proclaim, his voice rising to a crescendo, \"is THE ROPE!\" But McCrea, and all that he represents, has to be taken extremely seriously. The DUP victory in what was once a super-safe seat for the Ulster Unionists, casts a long shadow over the power-sharing executive in Belfast. The byelection could not have been worse timed for Trimble, who must preside over his party's annual conference next month. Almost certainly, he will be challenged - again - for the leadership, by one of the rightwingers chafing against power-sharing. The first minister will be looking to Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson for concessions, to prop up his suddenly precarious hold on his own party. What he would dearly love would be postponement, or better still cancellation, of plans to reform the Royal Ulster Constabulary. But even that might not appease the resurgent No Surrender tendency in unionism. The challenge could come from the Rev Martin Smyth, who ran Trimble desperately close in last year's leadership election. Another would-be standard bearer of the right, Jeffrey Donaldson MP, has already called on Trimble to withdraw from the executive. Paisley, the old warhorse of Ulster politics, is already bellowing with righteous triumphalism. \"I think Mr Trimble is finished, absolutely finished,\" he gloated after the South Antrim result. One of the minor ironies of the byelection is that the losing UUP candidate David Burnside - another survivor from the turbulent 1970s - is less than wholly committed himself to power-sharing. If Trimble is brought low by the South Antrim debacle, the ambitious Burnside could be one of those jostling for position.

      "bodyText": "George W Bush wasn't supposed to be campaigning in Florida today. The Republican party wasn't supposed to be spending more than $5m on political advertising in Florida this month. When the two main parties did their calculations for the 2000 election, Florida was firmly assigned in the Republican camp. Not any more. The Sunshine State has turned into the surprise state in the 2000 election. With Bush's brother Jeb now installed as its governor since 1998, most of the pundits originally assumed that Florida would revert to the Republicans in the presidential contest after going for Bill Clinton four years ago. Florida's 25 electoral college votes were seen as one of the key building blocks in George W's march on Washington. But it hasn't worked out that way. As the national polls have moved his way over the past month, Al Gore's long-time belief that Florida was winnable has seemed to be increasingly plausible. Three polls in the state this month have produced three different results - one had Gore up by four points, another had Bush ahead by two, while the third had them tied at 41 per cent each. But the disagreement in the polls only adds to the recognition that Florida is \"competitive\". Florida is the largest state in the US of which that can be said. The only larger states are California and New York, both of which are leaning to Gore, and Texas, which is a banker for Bush. In the 1980s, Florida was predictable too, voting the Republican ticket in four straight elections, until Clinton showed that it was not a lost cause to the Democrats in 1996. That's still the case now. Which is why Dubya is working a full Friday in Florida today, with stops in Sarasota, Tampa and Miami. If Florida swings to Gore, then it's all over for Bush. His schedulers had him in the state last week, and now he's there again this week too. To make sure that Bush doesn't get a free run today, the Democrats have directed Joe Lieberman down to Florida today too, to keep up the pressure and eat into Bush's air time. This is classic US electioneering. Every day you are tied down on defence is a day you let your opponent have a day on the attack somewhere else. Gore, meanwhile, will be piling up the votes today in Pennsylvania, a state which used be counted as a toss-up, but where he is now commandingly ahead. Florida is not just important for the presidential election. It also has a key Senate battle. The state's Republican senator Connie Mack is retiring, so there is an \"open\" contest between Democrat Bill Nelson, a genial centrist, and Republican Congressman Bill McCollum, who became a national figure as one of House of Representatives' Clinton impeachment trial \"managers\" last year. For Clinton, therefore, this is a grudge election, and it is one of the few states in which the president intends to make his presence felt during the campaign. Florida also matters a lot in this year's party battle over control of the House. If the Democrats are going to fulfil their second biggest ambition on November 7, they must pick up at least five seats around the US in order to retake the Congress. That would enable them to install Dick Gephardt of Missouri in the Speaker's chair that was captured by Newt Gingrich in 1994 and is now occupied by Illinois Republican Dennis Hastert. Of the 20 or so Republican-held House seats that really matter this time, three are in Florida. There is McCollum's old district around Disney World in southern Orlando, fellow impeachment manager Charles Canady's seat just east of Tampa (Canady is retiring), and Clay Shaw's ocean-front Costa Geriatrica seat, which takes in both Palm Beach and Miami Beach. Shaw's seat, in particular, could be affected by a new factor - as could the statewide races - as Florida's many Jewish retirees from up north grab the chance to vote for Mrs Lieberman's boy Joe. Florida was one of the first Southern states to move solidly away from the Democrats to the Republicans. Though never a classicly \"southern\" state, Florida could now be one of the first to mark a swing back to the Democrats in the region. There is evidence of that swing in neighbouring Georgia, too. But it's the presidential contest in Florida that really matters in the big picture. It explains why Gore has been to the state three times since the Democratic convention. It explains, above all, why Bush - who is enjoying a better few days in the campaign - is back there again today. No Republican since 1924 has won the White House without also winning Florida. Do what Dubya does too. Keep your eye on Florida. It is the state that Bush simply cannot afford to lose.",

The home side will fancy their chances here: although Saints were one of only five teams to come away from Valley Parade with a win last season, they are likely to be without in-form striker Marian Pahars - the man who scored their audacious winner last term.

Leeds have rediscovered their self-belief, which could spell trouble for the winless Rams - but at least Jim Smith's men can take heart from the absence of the melodramatic Harry Kewell, who won a dubious last-minute penalty for the visitors last year. Craig Burley should make his first start of the season for the hosts after his troublesome calf stood up to a midweek test in the reserves. However Lars Bohinen, who has been suffering from a similar injury, is unlikely to feature. Meanwhile, Mark Viduka - who was spotted earlier this week by our man at the Olympics strolling out of Sydney's Last Lap nightclub arm-in-arm with Stan Lazaridis - could make an early return to the Leeds side after returning from \"Olympic\" \"duty\" with Australia. Odds Derby 15/8 Draw 9/4 Leeds 6/5 Last season Derby 0 Leeds 1 (Harte 90 pen) Ipswich Town v Arsenal Ipswich's promising young defender Titus Bramble has recovered from a hip injury and should be ready to face Arsenal, who have been making a meal of supposedly easier away fixtures of late. The home side are unlikely to have James Scowcroft and Fabian Wilnis to call upon, but George Burley's men have found their feet in the top flight quicker than most observers expected and won't be unduly worried by enforced changes to their side.

      "body": "<p>I was 27 when I first saw Pasolini's Sal\u00f2. I worked nights at the popcorn concession of the Westland Twins, a Laemmle theatre in Westwood specialising in foreign films of the \"mature romance\" variety. A friend managed The Pico, an art cinema in the Fairfax District. It was autumn, 1977. I got off work at 10.30. I usually drove home to Los Angeles, stopping at The Pico, where Sal\u00f2 ran that season as a midnight movie. (Actually, I think it was an 11 o'clock midnight movie.) That's how I happened to see this film, or parts of it, almost every night for two months. </p> <p>It was a time of compulsive, almost mechanical sleeping around that felt good for a few moments here and there. I had two jobs, and about two hours at the end of the night to pick someone up in a bar. Whatever followed that took at least two more hours, depending on the drive time, so I suppose, in that faraway autumn of 1977, I got an average of three hours sleep a night. That was my life, and Sal\u00f2 became for two months a logical part of it, another little patch of soft, crumbly alienation and waking dream. </p> <p>Sal\u00f2 remains one of the most scandalous films ever made. An adaptation of the Marquis de Sade's 120 Days of Sodom, it is an unflinching portrayal of sexual cruelty set in fascist Italy. Through a panoply of the unspeakable - blood, excrement, torture and murder - Sal\u00f2 comments on the exercise of power, and on a consumer culture where a limitless choice of gratifications disguises an absence of all choice and all resistance. </p> <p>It's tricky to consider one of Pasolini's films in isolation, because he occupies so much space as a figure. At the same time, the energy that collects around big, imposing names in the cultural suet deserves a measure of scepticism. Once artists become monuments, the required way of regarding them is almost absurdly contrary to our way of regarding anything else. We are obliged to find worlds of meaning in every scrap of paper they might have doodled on, any material sign of their existence turns into manna. The resulting industry of preservation, worthy as it is, has the paradoxical effect of killing any spontaneous encounter with their work. Are we genuinely moved by Mozart's music, or are we moved because we know that Mozart's music is moving? Is the publication of Kafka's Blue Notebooks a revelation, or evidence that not everything an artist does is worth preserving? </p> <p>Sal\u00f2 is one of those rare works of art that really achieves shock value. Aesthetic shock does have a salutary value, and it's always amusing to read the outpourings of some cultural wastebasket decrying an artist who deploys shock \"for the sake of shock\", as if to qualify as a work of art, a work of art has to be something other than a work of art - a tutorial in cherished homilies, an affirmation of quotidian values, and so on. I don't think art has anything to do with morality and it shouldn't: I should be able to kill everybody I don't like in a novel and get away with it, rape a 12-year-old and piss on my father's grave. It's not my job to tell anybody that these things are \"wrong\". It's my job to show that these things happen, period. </p> <p>Certain works yank the rug from under the meticulously planted furniture of middle-class morality and the aesthetic torpor that decorates it. John Water's Pink Flamingos, Jean Rouch's Les Matres fous, George Franju's Le Sang des B tes, Andy Warhol's Blue Movie, anything by Hershel Gordon Lewis, scattered moments in the films of Kenneth Anger, Jack Smith and Jonas Mekas - well, you can make your own list of things that lifted the top of your head off. I'm not sure that anyone is obliged to like works of art that fall into this category, or that liking them is never entirely the point, though critics, quite often, mistake the celebration of the ghastly as an \"indictment of contemporary malaise\", etc - in other words, they can only like something if it can be bent to reflect their own moral certainties. </p> <p>One way that Sal\u00f2 differs from the unabashedly perverse epiphanies of the cinema of shock is in its pedantic moralism, which might have ruined it if the shock part didn't so thoroughly overwhelm the moralism. There is something absurdly winning about Pasolini's explanation of the shit-eating in Sal\u00f2 as a commentary on processed foods, and the fact that Pasolini was being sincere when he said it. And if you think about it, his interpretation is essentially reasonable, though it's hardly the first thing a viewer thinks when watching a roomful of people gobbling their own turds. </p> <p>The atmosphere of scandal that misted Sal\u00f2 when it appeared was an aerosol of semen, excrement and blood. Sal\u00f2 was awash in come and shit. The blood was Pasolini's. His murder, a gruesome affair involving a nail-studded fence picket and his own sports car, struck many as all of a piece with the sadomasochism of his last movie, and with a well-advertised lifetime of patronising rough trade. One French reviewer urged that Sal\u00f2 be shown as a defence exhibit at the murderer Pelosi's trial, on the assumption that anybody capable of directing such a film was practically begging to be murdered. </p> <p>This coincidental intersection of art and life, or art and death, became an inevitable ending, especially in a rightwing Italian press that loathed Pasolini. Once he was dead and past defending himself, the ugliest opinions about him surfaced. Was his open homosexuality the inspiration behind the denunciations and court cases that dogged his career, starting long before the segue from poet and novelist to film-maker? If we consider the artistic fortunes of a Franco Zeffirelli, it appears that only the wrong kind of faggot - a leftist rather than a reactionary, an intellectual instead of a flaming queen, someone who inserted himself in politics, took unpopular positions, made himself vulnerable - would have come in for the judicial harassment and vicious attacks that Pasolini did. While it can fairly be said that no artist of any prominence in Italy, Zeffirelli included, is ever uninvolved in politics on a quotidian level - almost nowhere else on earth is daily life subjected to such beetling, unrelieved ideological nattering - Pasolini's interventions were extreme and unflagging, pleasing to practically nobody across the political spectrum, and, uniquely, were intricately inscribed with the fact of his sexual difference. </p> <p>Pasolini was quick, and right, to use the word \"racism\" to describe a certain kind of criticism launched against him, which emanated from the perception of his \"essence\" as a pervert. He was a target of racism, in this sense, from his earliest days as a teacher, when he was charged with molesting four of his teenage students. One provocation of Sal\u00f2, like the X portfolio of Robert Mapplethorpe, is its ability to flush this racism into the open, revealing the limits of repressive tolerance - that social threshold of shock that says, We'll accept you if you become like us, love like us, talk like us, believe like us, hate like us . </p> <p>There is such a mixture of motives and curious impulses at work in Pasolini, longueurs that take your breath away and others that make you wince. In the words of Gombrowicz, discussing Balzac's Human Comedy: \"To think how easily the best soup gets spoiled when one adds a spoonful of old grease or a bit of toothpaste to it.\" And with Pasolini, it might not even be grease or toothpaste, but some misbegotten Brechtian fiddling with sightlines, or his endless indulgence of Ninetto Davolie, whose implacably sunny exuberance is often wearying. Still, Pasolini's elemental weirdness and audacity sustain interest (if not always sympathetic interest) through all but his most trying inventions. He is deeply, seductively cryptic: the more exposed, the more concealed, as if signalling from a world that can only be glimpsed in fragments. </p> <p> \u0095 Extracted from Sal\u00f2 or The 120 Days of Sodom by Gary Indiana, published by BFI Modern Classics.

      "bodyText": "I was 27 when I first saw Pasolini's Sal\u00f2. I worked nights at the popcorn concession of the Westland Twins, a Laemmle theatre in Westwood specialising in foreign films of the \"mature romance\" variety. A friend managed The Pico, an art cinema in the Fairfax District. It was autumn, 1977. I got off work at 10.30. I usually drove home to Los Angeles, stopping at The Pico, where Sal\u00f2 ran that season as a midnight movie. (Actually, I think it was an 11 o'clock midnight movie.) That's how I happened to see this film, or parts of it, almost every night for two months. It was a time of compulsive, almost mechanical sleeping around that felt good for a few moments here and there. I had two jobs, and about two hours at the end of the night to pick someone up in a bar. Whatever followed that took at least two more hours, depending on the drive time, so I suppose, in that faraway autumn of 1977, I got an average of three hours sleep a night. That was my life, and Sal\u00f2 became for two months a logical part of it, another little patch of soft, crumbly alienation and waking dream. Sal\u00f2 remains one of the most scandalous films ever made. An adaptation of the Marquis de Sade's 120 Days of Sodom, it is an unflinching portrayal of sexual cruelty set in fascist Italy. Through a panoply of the unspeakable - blood, excrement, torture and murder - Sal\u00f2 comments on the exercise of power, and on a consumer culture where a limitless choice of gratifications disguises an absence of all choice and all resistance. It's tricky to consider one of Pasolini's films in isolation, because he occupies so much space as a figure. At the same time, the energy that collects around big, imposing names in the cultural suet deserves a measure of scepticism. Once artists become monuments, the required way of regarding them is almost absurdly contrary to our way of regarding anything else. We are obliged to find worlds of meaning in every scrap of paper they might have doodled on, any material sign of their existence turns into manna. The resulting industry of preservation, worthy as it is, has the paradoxical effect of killing any spontaneous encounter with their work. Are we genuinely moved by Mozart's music, or are we moved because we know that Mozart's music is moving? Is the publication of Kafka's Blue Notebooks a revelation, or evidence that not everything an artist does is worth preserving? Sal\u00f2 is one of those rare works of art that really achieves shock value. Aesthetic shock does have a salutary value, and it's always amusing to read the outpourings of some cultural wastebasket decrying an artist who deploys shock \"for the sake of shock\", as if to qualify as a work of art, a work of art has to be something other than a work of art - a tutorial in cherished homilies, an affirmation of quotidian values, and so on. I don't think art has anything to do with morality and it shouldn't: I should be able to kill everybody I don't like in a novel and get away with it, rape a 12-year-old and piss on my father's grave. It's not my job to tell anybody that these things are \"wrong\". It's my job to show that these things happen, period. Certain works yank the rug from under the meticulously planted furniture of middle-class morality and the aesthetic torpor that decorates it. John Water's Pink Flamingos, Jean Rouch's Les Matres fous, George Franju's Le Sang des B tes, Andy Warhol's Blue Movie, anything by Hershel Gordon Lewis, scattered moments in the films of Kenneth Anger, Jack Smith and Jonas Mekas - well, you can make your own list of things that lifted the top of your head off. I'm not sure that anyone is obliged to like works of art that fall into this category, or that liking them is never entirely the point, though critics, quite often, mistake the celebration of the ghastly as an \"indictment of contemporary malaise\", etc - in other words, they can only like something if it can be bent to reflect their own moral certainties. One way that Sal\u00f2 differs from the unabashedly perverse epiphanies of the cinema of shock is in its pedantic moralism, which might have ruined it if the shock part didn't so thoroughly overwhelm the moralism. There is something absurdly winning about Pasolini's explanation of the shit-eating in Sal\u00f2 as a commentary on processed foods, and the fact that Pasolini was being sincere when he said it. And if you think about it, his interpretation is essentially reasonable, though it's hardly the first thing a viewer thinks when watching a roomful of people gobbling their own turds. The atmosphere of scandal that misted Sal\u00f2 when it appeared was an aerosol of semen, excrement and blood. Sal\u00f2 was awash in come and shit. The blood was Pasolini's. His murder, a gruesome affair involving a nail-studded fence picket and his own sports car, struck many as all of a piece with the sadomasochism of his last movie, and with a well-advertised lifetime of patronising rough trade. One French reviewer urged that Sal\u00f2 be shown as a defence exhibit at the murderer Pelosi's trial, on the assumption that anybody capable of directing such a film was practically begging to be murdered. This coincidental intersection of art and life, or art and death, became an inevitable ending, especially in a rightwing Italian press that loathed Pasolini. Once he was dead and past defending himself, the ugliest opinions about him surfaced. Was his open homosexuality the inspiration behind the denunciations and court cases that dogged his career, starting long before the segue from poet and novelist to film-maker? If we consider the artistic fortunes of a Franco Zeffirelli, it appears that only the wrong kind of faggot - a leftist rather than a reactionary, an intellectual instead of a flaming queen, someone who inserted himself in politics, took unpopular positions, made himself vulnerable - would have come in for the judicial harassment and vicious attacks that Pasolini did. While it can fairly be said that no artist of any prominence in Italy, Zeffirelli included, is ever uninvolved in politics on a quotidian level - almost nowhere else on earth is daily life subjected to such beetling, unrelieved ideological nattering - Pasolini's interventions were extreme and unflagging, pleasing to practically nobody across the political spectrum, and, uniquely, were intricately inscribed with the fact of his sexual difference. Pasolini was quick, and right, to use the word \"racism\" to describe a certain kind of criticism launched against him, which emanated from the perception of his \"essence\" as a pervert. He was a target of racism, in this sense, from his earliest days as a teacher, when he was charged with molesting four of his teenage students. One provocation of Sal\u00f2, like the X portfolio of Robert Mapplethorpe, is its ability to flush this racism into the open, revealing the limits of repressive tolerance - that social threshold of shock that says, We'll accept you if you become like us, love like us, talk like us, believe like us, hate like us . There is such a mixture of motives and curious impulses at work in Pasolini, longueurs that take your breath away and others that make you wince. In the words of Gombrowicz, discussing Balzac's Human Comedy: \"To think how easily the best soup gets spoiled when one adds a spoonful of old grease or a bit of toothpaste to it.\" And with Pasolini, it might not even be grease or toothpaste, but some misbegotten Brechtian fiddling with sightlines, or his endless indulgence of Ninetto Davolie, whose implacably sunny exuberance is often wearying. Still, Pasolini's elemental weirdness and audacity sustain interest (if not always sympathetic interest) through all but his most trying inventions. He is deeply, seductively cryptic: the more exposed, the more concealed, as if signalling from a world that can only be glimpsed in fragments. \u0095 Extracted from Sal\u00f2 or The 120 Days of Sodom by Gary Indiana, published by BFI Modern Classics. The film is showing at the ICA, London SW1, from October 20 to November 2. Box office: 020 7930 0493.",

But I suspect that the reader lives in the United States where newspapers, unlike those in most other countries, insist on calling the Iraqi leader \"Mr Hussein\". That, I'm afraid, is another example of Americans trying to apply their own cultural practices to the rest of the world. They seem to be under the impression that \"Hussein\" is Saddam's surname. It isn't. Calling him \"Mr Hussein\" is like calling George W Bush \"Mr W\". Actually, I much prefer to call him \"Saddam\". The name comes from an Arabic verb meaning to clash, strike, bang, collide or generally behave in a hostile fashion. You may think the Iraqi leader's parents were remarkably far-sighted in making such an appropriate choice, but in the Middle East it's usually a sign of superstitious parents who believe that an offensive name will protect their offspring from the Evil Eye. In any case, referring to Arabs by their first name does not imply the same degree of familiarity that it does in the west. Since starting to write about the Middle East, I have become quite accustomed to Arabs addressing me formally as \"Mr Brian\" or, more flatteringly when they misread my name, as \"Mr Brain\". By tradition, a male Arab's full name consists of his first name, followed by his father's first name and then his grandfather's first name. It is by no means rare for two of these names to be the same, and it is theoretically possible, though not very aesthetic, for someone to be called Mohammed Mohammed Mohammed. Using this formula, the Iraqi president's full name would be Saddam Hussein abdal-Majid. In traditional Arab societies, where everyone knew each other and ancestry was of great social importance, that kind of naming system was perfectly adequate. Although the old system continues to some extent, many Arabs nowadays have what we would recognise in the west as surnames. Often they describe a person's job or place of origin and some are quite recent acquisitions. A Moroccan friend tells me that his father chose the family's surname during the French occupation because the authorities insisted that everybody should have one. Iraq, however, moved in the opposite direction. In the early years of Saddam's rule, surnames were abolished for ideological reasons: they were thought to be socially divisive. Cynics suggest that the real reason was to hide the fact that, as Saddam consolidated his power, an uncomfortably large number of people rising to positions of influence had the surname \"al-Takriti\" - indicating that they came from the dictator's home town. There may be a lesson here for Bahrain, where 10 out of 17 government ministers today carry the name \"al-Khalifa\", or Kuwait, where eight out of 23 ministers are called \"al-Sabah\". Regardless of a person's official name, it is not unusual for an Arab to be known locally, or among friends, as someone completely different. This led to confusion during the first free elections in Yemen in 1993, when voters were required to write the name of their preferred candidate on the ballot paper. Some, especially in the rural areas, knew the candidates only by their familiar names and had no idea what they were officially called. One way that familiar names arise is following the birth of a man's first son (a matter of considerable pride in Arab society), at which point people may start calling him after his son: \"Abu Ahmad\", \"Abu Hassan\" - the father of Ahmad, the father of Hassan, etc. But \"Abu\" - meaning \"father\" - can be taken too literally. Abu Nidal, the Palestinian guerrilla leader, wasn't named after a son called Nidal. It's a political nom de guerre, meaning \"the father of struggle\". And, though you'll occasionally hear an Arab refer to someone as \"Abu Nadhara\", don't be fooled into thinking that's his name.

The FTSE 100 index kept off its recent lows, but remained deep inside negative territory on Friday morning after Intel's overnight warning that third quarter profits would come in way below expectations. Initially, the news sent the index tumbling down more than 120 points. By mid morning it had pulled back a little, though it remained around 81 points down at 6,118.2. When the news broke in the US last night, shares in the company immediately plunged by 21%, sending its value down by $77bn. Intel's sales growth in the third quarter is now expected to reach only 3-5% compared with the 6-8%, expected by the market. The company - the world's largest chip maker and manufacturer of computer, networking and communications products - blames a lack of European demand for its microprocessors and expects profit margin percentages to be down by up to 2%. Revenue in the second quarter of this year was $8.3bn. Intel's statement, which came shortly after a warning by Sprint Corp, has compounded fears of a sharp slowdown in the tech and telecommunications sectors. Almost all of the top 10 losers on the FTSE 100 were technology shares, such as UK chip designer ARM Holdings which dived 8.1%, while fibre optics firm Bookham Technology dropped 7%.

But we hope that it\u0092s only a start. We are, after all, only half way through these games, and, of course, the paralympics are still to come.</p> <p>I am glad you agree that our top-level athletes should be supported. For too long, we have asked our brightest and best sportsmen and women to rely on natural talent and nothing else; juggling training, competition and full-time work. One of the most frustrating parts of my job in the past was to receive letters from potential winners or their parents saying they were giving up because they were broke and could not continue. Most other successful sporting nations provide financial support (of one form or another) to their athletes and, if we are to compete on the world stage, we must have similar systems in place here.</p> <p>You are right, however, to stress the importance of looking beyond our current crop of top-level athletes. In addition to funding those \u0093at the peak of their careers\u0094 our world class programme is beginning also to support the next generation of medal-winners \u0096 those who we want to see win in Commonwealth and Olympic games in the next decade.

But I regard this not as a \u0093further\u0094 step as you put it, but as the first one, the most important one, the one you make before you set off for more ambitious destinations like Sydney or Greece.</p> <p>The main reason for this is that we have to provide all children with a sound level of sporting literacy. I\u0092m not talking of those who\u0092d know a Wisden from a jar of Marmite. I\u0092m referring to those basic skills which are the building blocks of sporting activity, whether it is simple hand-eye co-ordination, flexibility or fitness. Imagine, some children pitch up at secondary school not knowing how to stop a ball with their feet. Is it any wonder that the Premier League sides are all packed with foreign imports?</p> <p>We cannot possibly expect to excel in sport on an international stage while our schools have poorly-trained teachers, playing fields that vanish, and where there is a general expectation that it is up to parents to support their kids\u0092 sporting ambitions. I realise of course, that this is hardly your fault, and your scheme to fund national sports co-ordinators will undoubtedly help to raise awareness and hopefully enthusiasm. But what is needed urgently is better all-round sports education within schools.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br> Janette</p> <p><b>Dear Janette,</b><br> Aren\u0092t we supposed to be arguing with each other? The journey to the top of the medal rostrum does begin with the first PE lesson, where the basic skills to which you refer are taught. And the most important person in British sport is the PE teacher. I believe teachers are doing an excellent job, but often need more training and certainly more resources. Some teachers spend fewer than 10 hours on PE during teacher training, and many that I have spoken with have told me that they feel less confident during lessons as a result. And of course, school sport teaches children so many life and social skills, such as working with others. What better way can youngsters gain the confidence to deal with everyday life?</p> <p>We are working with partners to ensure that teachers get the best support in terms of practical skills and ideas. The TOPs scheme, funded with \u00a37m of Lottery money, provides schools with a range of sports equipment and training in its use. Every primary school in the country will be part of this by July 2001, complementing the new School Sports Co-ordinators.</p> <p>School sport v top level sport? No, it is not a competition between the two. They both feed off each other, the first providing the base; the second, encouragement to youngsters to get involved through watching a role model. I believe sport can also help social and economic regeneration, but I haven\u0092t heard you say much about sport in the local community.</p> <p>Yours,<br> Derek</p> <p><b>Dear Derek,</b><br> The basis of our (delightfully polite) argument as I understand it, is to question whether we should go for instant medal gratification by showering money on our Olympic athletes, while local schools and clubs are reduced to having a whip-round every time they want to fill the holes in the Astroturf. Judging from the media euphoria and the evident relief of BBC presenters, it has been money well spent.</p> <p>I believe however, that this is a short-term and unrealistic approach to raising standards in this much-frustrated, sports-mad country of ours. Yes, it will give youngsters role models in all sorts of sports, but how are they going to emulate this new band of heroes if there are no local facilities, or their own skills have been so poorly nurtured that even one-to-one coaching with Andre Agassi wouldn\u0092t ever make a decent tennis player out of them? </p> <p>Sport performs all sorts of important social functions, as you say. It also promotes life skills like team spirit, self-confidence and a generally healthy approach to life. But if we are ever going to turn our base metal into gold with anything like the panache of Australia or the US, then we are going to have to invert the current funding pyramid so that youth sport gets the lion\u0092s share and gets it first.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br> Janette</p> <p><b>Dear Janette,</b><br> I have every sympathy with what you say about better facilities. I find it incredibly frustrating when I travel the country and see people still using Victorian baths, sports halls and swimming pools that are no longer of a quality which the community deserves, and clubs crying out for better facilities and equipment.</p> <p>You advocate inverting the pyramid so that more money goes into community sport. In fact it already does, and we mustn\u0092t forget that the cornerstone of sport and recreation is the \u00a31bn per year that local authorities invest in the running of sports centres and the like.</p> <p>The Lottery has allowed us to provide new facilities in partnership with local authorities and the voluntary sector. Participation has doubled in areas where we have funded facilities. We still have much more work to do with young people, in inner cities and deprived rural areas, both to provide recreational sport and to identify local talent. Published figures show that there is a shopping list for swimming pools and sports centres alone, worth some \u00a33-4bn. We agree there\u0092s a long way to go. </p> <p>I\u0092m sure that our collective ambition must be to provide opportunities in schools, access to sport in the community, ways of identifying talent and providing support for top performers. </p> <p>We started this discussion talking about the Olympics and my view is that, at the end of the first week, we can be cautiously optimistic that Lottery funding has made a difference.

      "body": "<p>Picture a 1940s Los Angeles detective checking out why those cars have been parked on Paseo Miramar outside the German guy's villa for so long. You probably think noir. You probably think Philip Marlowe. You probably don't think RB Hood. </p> <p>Yet when it came to working the beat in the city that knows how to keep its secrets, Hood was the man. As the special agent in charge of the FBI division in LA throughout much of the 40s and 50s, he had the job of coordinating everything that could be found out about some of the most celebrated foreign exiles ever to make their way to the United States. </p> <p>In the 40s, his job was to spy on Bertolt Brecht, Erich Maria Remarque, Thomas Mann, his brother Heinrich, and dozens of other celebrated refugees from Hitler's Germany, many of whom had come to Hollywood in search of work. Everything that Hood and his fellow G-men found out about them would eventually find its way to FBI chief J Edgar Hoover in Washington. And now their reports have found their way into Alexander Stephan's extraordinary new book documenting the secret surveillance years. </p> <p>During the 30s, dozens of German artists, writers and musicians - many, but not all Jewish - fled the Third Reich and eventually found their way to the US. Though they were exiles from fascism, they remained objects of official suspicion, especially if they had leftwing politics or associations. When the second world war ended and the cold war began, the official suspicions grew stronger not weaker. The FBI called these exiles \"Communazis\" because they believed that though they were refugees from one form of tyranny, they might also be in league with a second form. </p> <p>The fact that the US government kept files on writers as famous as Brecht and Mann is not a new discovery. But Stephan has used American freedom of information law to unearth more than 10,000 pages of new material which vastly extend what is known about the surveillance operations. Everything from the way the writers lived, their conversations, their friends, their private lives and loves - and even the details of the books they were writing - formed part of the steady stream of information sent back to Hoover. </p> <p>Hood and his team of agents were interested in everything that the German writers were up to. They tapped their phones. They opened their mail. They kept watch on them. And they interviewed the writers themselves, their circles and their casual acquaintances - mostly without the Germans having the faintest idea of how closely they were being monitored. </p> <p>When one of the writers met a Russian, or someone who might have contacts with the Russians, Hood kept a note of it. It was Hood who checked the cars outside Lion Feuchtwanger's villa by the ocean. It was Hood who got to know when Heinrich Mann's wife Nelly was stopped for drunken driving in Beverly Hills. It was Hood's men who broke in to Leonhard Frank's house on a fishing expedition for evidence of communist sympathies. And it was Hood's men who searched the luggage of Brecht's mistress, Ruth Berlau. </p> <p>Why the FBI kept track of the German exiles is easy to explain. \"The communist movement\", raged Hoover, \"stands for the destruction of our American form of government\". More surprising was the thoroughness of the surveillance - a thoroughness which in other circumstances might be described as Germanic. </p> <p>Relatively uncontroversial exiles such as Franz Werfel, the Austrian Jewish playwright who married Gustav Mahler's widow Alma, got the same treatment as overtly political writers such as Brecht, who was identified in FBI files as \"a propagandist of communism and sovietism\". </p> <p>Parking your car in the street near the Communist party offices in Los Angeles would merit an entry in Hood's files, as Johanna Kortner, wife of the exiled actor Fritz Kortner, never discovered when she did it inadvertently one day. Writers such as Heinrich Mann, who wrote almost nothing in his late years in the US, would be assiduously documented with the same thoroughness as Feuchtwanger, who continued to write and publish his novels from California, and whose bids for American citizenship Hoover blocked with repeated and ill-concealed glee. </p> <p>By far the biggest fish in Hood's net, however, was Thomas Mann. The author of Buddenbrooks, Death in Venice and The Magic Mountain was, by a considerable distance, the most famous and eminent German writer of his era, as well as the most celebrated of all the exiles who set tled in the US. As the winner of the Nobel prize for literature and a major public figure, Mann was a hugely influential voice. Any attempts by him to become involved in organisations of which Hoover was suspicious - or attempts by such groups to recruit him - were carefully tracked and recorded by the FBI, as well as by other American security organisations and by the state department. </p> <p>The portion of Mann's career in the US which most alarmed the watchers was an attempt to form a German exile organisation in America, with Mann as its leader and figurehead. In 1943, the office of strategic services (the forerunner of the CIA) tried to frustrate such a move. \"Thomas Mann is extremely important and useful for any group which might be needed later,\" the OSS recorded, and managed to convey their views to the novelist, who duly backed away from the plan. Mann was in a category of his own. He seems to have been too major a figure to be placed under routine surveillance of the kind to which both his brother Heinrich and his son Klaus - as well as Feuchtwanger and Brecht - were subjected. </p> <p>Klaus Mann, the author of Mephisto, was a particularly frequent FBI target. Even his postman was recruited as an informant. Klaus attracted attention partly because of his leftwing politics, but also because of his homosexuality. The files unearthed by Stephan refer to Mann as \"a well-known sexual pervert\" with \"communistic sympathies\". </p> <p>The bureau's files contain some very detailed surveillance. When Klaus Mann stayed in the Bedford Hotel in New York, an informant identified only as \"T3\" reported that a soldier \"with fair complexion and dirty blond hair\" stayed overnight with him regularly. \"Informant advised that the only suitable sleeping place in Mann's room is a single bed\", the files report. \"Informant further advised that quite a number of 'longhairs' go in and out to see Mann.\" </p> <p>The FBI snoopers speculated that Mann may have had a sexual relationship with his sister Erika, one- time wife of WH Auden. \"Confidential informants\" told agents that the two were having an affair, one file reports. Erika Mann was described in the files as having her hair cut \"in a short mannish bob with a part on the right side\" and to be close to a group of political actors who were \"members of the Hebrew race\". </p> <p>In the end, though, Erika Mann turned the tables on her watchers. She became an informant as early as 1940, and for much of the next 15 years cooperated willingly with dozens of inquiries about members of the German exile community, some of whom she too suspected of pro-Nazi connections. </p> <p>It was an approach which landed her in increasing difficulties as the cold war developed. When the two Soviet spies Guy Burgess and Donald MacLean defected to Russia in May 1951, Mann was hauled in by the FBI, who suspected that, with her connections, she might have useful information about Burgess in particular. But she had not even heard of the defections until the FBI agents told her about them. </p> <p>\"Erika Mann seems to have talked with US agencies like the FBI more openly and for a longer period than any other exiled writer,\" Stephan concludes. No such thing can be said of Bertolt Brecht's case, on which Stephan has unearthed more than 400 pages of new documents. \"He is of sufficient importance to international communism that the Bureau should be aware of all his activities and contacts,\" says one document. In another, dated April 1943, special agent Hood sent a memo to Hoover to start internment proceedings against the poet and playwright. In a third, offering a curious tribute, the OSS classifies Brecht as \"a gifted dramatist\" and a \"poet of expressionistic vigour\". \"Subject is a writer of communist and revolutionary poetry and drama,\" Hood reported to Washington. \"Is looked upon by German communists as their poet laureate.\" </p> <p>Hood was as assiduous as ever, sending Hoover English versions, translated by FBI linguists, of one of Brecht's longhand poems. \"The poem specifically refers to a United States steamer which was destroyed by its crew since they were paid too small wages,\" Hood informed Hoover. Brecht's play, Die Massnahme, was also translated inside the bureau for Hood to send to Hoover. \"A self-styled 'educational play' which advocates communist world revolution by violent means,\" Hood reported. </p> <p>Many of the new documents on Brecht show how seriously the FBI took the links between the poet and the so-called Free German exiles in Mexico, many of whom were unable to get into the US, and Moscow. \"It is recommended that the following subjects be placed in the National Censorship Watch List for 90 days,\" petitioned Hood: \"1. [name blacked out], 2. Bertolt Brecht, 1063 26th Street, Santa Monica, California, 3. [name blacked out].\" </p> <p> In 1945, the FBI began tapping Brecht's phone calls and mail. The records show contacts with Hollywood greats such as Charles Laughton, Charlie Chaplin and Billy Wilder - as well as conversations about a friend's plan to store some furniture in Brecht's garage. The contents are often banal, and even merely take the form of a list. \"A letter postmarked February 7 was received by Brecht fromWH Auden, 16 Oberlin Avenue, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania\" is all that one entry tantalisingly contains. Others are poignant. \"Love, I am so glad that you are fighting so courageously,\" Brecht is reported to have written to his lover Ruth Berlau after she had given birth to their child (who soon died). \"Don't think that I do not want to see you when you are ill. You are very beautiful then too.\" </p> <p>Stephan takes a lenient view of the story which he has unearthed. Not one of the exiles \"was murdered, tortured, deported back to Europe and turned over to the Gestapo\", he writes. \"Nor do the files indicate that agency interrogations had a direct negative influence on a writer's career\". The catalogue of sins committed by the FBI and the other agencies was modest, he judges. </p> <p>Nonetheless, Stephan believes the last word should lie with the great American jurist Justice Louis Brandeis, who wrote in 1928: \"The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well meaning but without understanding.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Communazis: FBI Surveillance of German Emigr\u00e9 Writers, is published by Yale University Press in October</p>",

      "body": "<p>Telecoms regulator Oftel has issued \"tough\" guidelines on the roll-out of broadband internet access in the UK, amid mounting criticism that BT is holding up the process. </p> <p>BT said it is seeking clarification on the guidelines, particularly the demand that its exchanges be made available within four months. A spokesperson said this should apply only to four trial exchanges, which will be ready by January. </p> <p>The news represents the latest bout of uncertainty in a process that this week saw Oftel bow to pressure from telecoms operators and select 360 BT exchanges for the installation of broadband equipment. Thirty-five companies are bidding for access to local exchanges.</p> <p>The regulator also moved to end the squabbling between operators and BT, saying it will resolve all disputes over price and space allocation. </p> <p>David Edmonds, director general of Oftel, said: \"Local loop unbundling will bring a step change to businesses, consumers and the telecoms industry itself. I am determined to implement it as quickly as possible so that all companies can compete fairly to deliver these revolutionary new high-speed services.\"</p> <p>Edmonds has gone back to the drawing board after admitting earlier this week that Oftel should have been firmer in its handling of the process and submitted proposals sooner.</p> <p>The announcement comes as operators' complaints over BT's behaviour reach a crescendo, with RSL Communications and Global Crossing withdrawing from the bidding process and Colt Telecom demanding a quicker roll out. </p> <p>US telecoms group WorldCom yesterday also stepped away, citing \"commercial and business reasons\", while denying any frustration with BT.</p> <p>RSL said the broadband internet market was wide open for BT, because initial access for rival operators is restricted to local exchanges. BT said it would take longer to open up urban exchanges, where competitors will be fighting for space. </p> <p>\"The regulators should be more hands-on,\" said one analyst. \"Evidence in the US shows that strong regulation is needed for this kind of thing. There needs to be more intervention from Oftel to chivvy BT along, although I understand it is a very complicated process.\"</p> <p>The \"loop\" being unbundled is the last mile of copper wires connecting homes to the network, which is then made available for broadband internet operators. Oftel said there will be full competition by 2001, but observers have poured scorn on the pace of the roll-out.</p> <p>Serafino Abape, of telecoms consultancy Ovum, said: \"European countries are completely inexperienced in dealing with unbundling, and there is no pan-European legislation offering a firm guide.\"</p> <p>BT's shares tumbled 5.7% to 746p, following a profits warning on Wednesday from Sprint Corporation of the US.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Telecoms regulator Oftel has issued \"tough\" guidelines on the roll-out of broadband internet access in the UK, amid mounting criticism that BT is holding up the process. BT said it is seeking clarification on the guidelines, particularly the demand that its exchanges be made available within four months. A spokesperson said this should apply only to four trial exchanges, which will be ready by January. The news represents the latest bout of uncertainty in a process that this week saw Oftel bow to pressure from telecoms operators and select 360 BT exchanges for the installation of broadband equipment. Thirty-five companies are bidding for access to local exchanges. The regulator also moved to end the squabbling between operators and BT, saying it will resolve all disputes over price and space allocation. David Edmonds, director general of Oftel, said: \"Local loop unbundling will bring a step change to businesses, consumers and the telecoms industry itself. I am determined to implement it as quickly as possible so that all companies can compete fairly to deliver these revolutionary new high-speed services.\" Edmonds has gone back to the drawing board after admitting earlier this week that Oftel should have been firmer in its handling of the process and submitted proposals sooner. The announcement comes as operators' complaints over BT's behaviour reach a crescendo, with RSL Communications and Global Crossing withdrawing from the bidding process and Colt Telecom demanding a quicker roll out. US telecoms group WorldCom yesterday also stepped away, citing \"commercial and business reasons\", while denying any frustration with BT. RSL said the broadband internet market was wide open for BT, because initial access for rival operators is restricted to local exchanges. BT said it would take longer to open up urban exchanges, where competitors will be fighting for space. \"The regulators should be more hands-on,\" said one analyst. \"Evidence in the US shows that strong regulation is needed for this kind of thing. There needs to be more intervention from Oftel to chivvy BT along, although I understand it is a very complicated process.\" The \"loop\" being unbundled is the last mile of copper wires connecting homes to the network, which is then made available for broadband internet operators. Oftel said there will be full competition by 2001, but observers have poured scorn on the pace of the roll-out. Serafino Abape, of telecoms consultancy Ovum, said: \"European countries are completely inexperienced in dealing with unbundling, and there is no pan-European legislation offering a firm guide.\" BT's shares tumbled 5.7% to 746p, following a profits warning on Wednesday from Sprint Corporation of the US.",

      "bodyText": "Back in 1992, when Danes rejected the Maastricht treaty, delighted eurosceptic British MPs burst into a lusty \"Wonderful Wonderful Copenhagen\" to thank them for sticking a Scandinavian spoke into the wheels of European integration. Plenty of people will be happy if the Danes say \"nej\" again in next Thursday's referendum on the euro - because it will be a blow to the faltering single currency and the idea of \"ever closer union\" that Maastricht called for. With Tony Blair and his Swedish counterpart Goran Persson waiting to decide whether to hold their own referenda, Denmark's choice could make the difference between a Euroland that remains stuck for the time being at 12 (Greece joins the current 11 next year), or expands to cover the whole 15-member EU. Intensive public opinion polling certainly indicates that a \"no\" vote is likely: the two latest and most authoritative polls, in Friday's Berlingske Tidende and the rival Politiken, gave opponents a lead of eight to 10 points - spelling gloom for the Social Democratic prime minister Poul Nyrup Rassmussen. And beyond the polls, the mood is negative, to judge by casual conversation with random taxi drivers - as every journalist knows, the best if thoroughly amateur way to take the pulse of any nation. \"I'm going to vote 'no' because I don't want any more union,\" explained one middle-aged Copenhagen cabbie. \"Many Danes are frightened of this idea of a United States of Europe.\" But a younger driver was more concerned about joining a \"rich man's club\" while candidates queuing up to join the EU from eastern Europe would be left out. \"It's a silly idea.

Many admit to being confused about the pros and cons of joining: the government-led \"yes\" campaign, backed by business, insists it will be good for jobs and growth. But the economic advantages may be slight as the krone is already pegged closely to the euro, just as it was to the German mark before that. Getting a seat on the board of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt seems to many to be a poor substitute for an independent national bank - however illusory that independence is. Arguing abstractly for the benefits of gaining political and economic \"influence\" as supporters do, does not seem to be enough to counter uncertainty. Despite repeated claims that the fundamentals of the Euroland economies are strong - with low unemployment and inflation - the continued battering of the euro against the US dollar has bolstered the image of a weak, undesirable currency. And Danes care about their krone, even though the austere features of Queen Margaretha will still be on one side of their euro coins even if they say yes. Surrendering it could be a leap into the unknown. \"A nation's coins have a mainly practical function, but they are also a symbol, a tangible guarantee, symbolising trust in the nation, monarch and relations with one's compatriots, particularly if one lives in a tiny country,\" said Aarhus university anthropologist Torben Vestergaard.

Mr Gore called on the US government - of which he is still a part - to order the release of part of the national emergency fuel reserves to help drive down domestic petrol prices before winter and the November 7 election. \"We need aggressive action right now,\" Mr Gore said in Maryland. \"It's time for Opec to get serious about the supply and price of oil.\" Within an hour, the Republican candidate George W Bush denounced Mr Gore's proposal as electioneering. \"The strategic reserve should not be used as an attempt to drive down oil prices right before the election, for short term gain at the cost of long term security,\" he said. Though there is no sign of the US being hit by anything remotely approaching the civil unrest in Europe, the price of petrol and domestic heating fuel remains a contentious issue. US oil and petrol prices are among the lowest in the industrial world, but prices at the pumps have increased by more than 50% in the past year and there were protests from truckers last winter. The Democrats want to put themselves on the side of the consumer against the oil companies - partly because both Mr Bush and his running mate Dick Cheney spent many years as oil executives. As well as urging President Clinton to release oil from the reserves, Mr Gore attacked oil companies for profiteering, and called on Opec nations to increase production. Mr Gore also said the Republican-controlled Congress should establish a permanent home heating oil reserve, and urged emergency action to help low income families with their fuel bills. However, the Bush campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes said dipping into reserves would allow leaders such as Saddam Hussein \"to literally put America over a barrel\". Mr Bush's campaign team also put out copies of a recent memo from the treasury secretary, Larry Summers, in which he claimed that attempts to drive down the price by opening the reserve would be \"a major and substantial policy mistake\".",

The city enters day seven today of a strike by 4,400 drivers, members of the United Transportation Union. The picket lines are out, sympathetic motorists toot their horns as they drive past strikers and the Los Angeles Times assigned no fewer than 20 reporters to cover its effects. The strike was prompted by the decision of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to introduce a new system of working which would cut overtime costs. The drivers, who earn between $10 (\u00a37) and $20 an hour depending on how much overtime they do, say that ending the current system would cause them serious financial damage. Talks broke down last Friday, and by Saturday the stoppage had started. In most other cities in the world, a transport strike of this magnitude would cause chaos on the roads as commuters take to their cars. But in LA, most of the commuters took to their cars about 40 years ago so the volume of traffic, according to the Highway patrol, was up a mere 5%. The roots of the problem go back some 50 years, when an unholy alliance of the oil, tyre and automobile industries conspired to buy up land that could have been used for the expansion of a proper public transport system. Although the miscreants were slapped on the wrist with a fine under anti-trust laws, the damage was done and Los Angeles became a city where the definition of a loser was someone without a car. The people most dependant on public transport are the poorest members of the community, the cleaners and gardeners, the waiters and nannies, mainly Latino or black. What is significant is that the most active group representing the interests of these passengers, the Bus Riders' Union, is fully in sympathy with the drivers. They argue that, if the 450,000 stranded passengers were from the white middle class, the MTA would been desperate to settle the dispute and find other ways of funding public transport. So yesterday, parts of LA were reminiscent of crowded cities in central America, where vans cruise the roads with their drivers shouting out their destinations in Spanish and picking up passengers as they go. The big difference, of course, is that here these \"collectivos\" are charging $3 or $4 rather than the few cents they would be asking for in Mexico City. Talks were due to resume in Pasadena. Provided all the negotiators are able to get there.",

      "body": "<p> I went to a film last week. I almost said I went to a movie, but it wasn't a movie. Movies are from Hollywood, they have pretty girls and handsome men, special effects and capitalistic morals. This - Beau Travail, Claire Denis's blood-melting tale of the Foreign Legion in Djibouti - was a film. </p> <p>Of course, it was more interesting, more intelligent, stranger and longer-lasting in the mind (in short, better) than 99% of Hollywood movies. That goes without saying. But what haunts me about it is nothing auteurish or filmic: it is the handsome men. The male faces. In fact, one face. One really ugly face. </p> <p>You know this face, if you've been to the cinema in the past couple of years. It is the bloke in the beer ad: his father is dying, he brings him a flagon of this very expensive beer on the back of a wagon, drinks it and blames the priest. His name is Denis Lavant. In the ad he is an effective clown, with a monkey mug. In Beau Travail, he is the image of humanity. His face is the story. He is fabulous. And he is so ugly. </p> <p>The other legionnaires are, without exception, beautiful, and their beauty is lingered on, against bleak deserts and burning skies, and very nice that is, too. But his is the face that came back with me. I dreamed about him. If I were 15 I'd put a picture of him on my bedroom wall. I might anyway. </p> <p>Casting an eye over the Hollywood boys of the day - Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Antonio Banderas - I can't actually remember what they look like. Except that they all look like they're wearing foundation and false teeth. Which they probably are. And then Lavant springs to mind, or Daniel Auteuil as the utterly phallic knife-thrower in La Fille sur le Pont, or the mad, dying king in La Reine Margot, all pock-marked, with hollow cheeks and snaggle teeth. And I think: now we're talking. Why? </p> <p>When I was a girl we had a concept we called sexy acne: ex-acne, combined with a certain strength of character. I suspect now that this was sexy because it suggested that its owner had a knowledge of suffering, and would therefore be wise. Clear skin suggests a worry-free existence and long nights of uninterrupted sleep. Nice now, but not interesting when you're young. An ugly man carries suffering and experience in his face; a pretty man knows only admiration. The nearest a girl can get to being ugly meanwhile is being incredibly beautiful but tastefully ravaged, like Marianne Faithfull, or all bone structure, like Barbra Streisand. Even so, Starville can only handle one at a time of them, and you don't ever get lady stars with no cheekbones at all and bad skin. </p> <p>Now, in Hollywood, it seems to me the men are being prettified to the same degree that women have been. Even Richard E Grant has started to look like an airbrushed sitcom person not, as he rightfully should, the devil incarnate. Russell Crowe is as far as ugliness for men goes over there, and Crowe counting as ugly just proves that, according to Hollywood, we should all have major plastic surgery. In fact, we might as well just have our throats cut. </p> <p> So in the US, Lyle Lovett - truly the most attractive Texan ever, and yes he does look like a parsnip - is mocked and tormented for marrying beautiful Julia Roberts. George Clooney - who is clearly moisturised to within an inch of his life - counts as butch. G\u00e9rard Depardieu in his Hollywood films looks as if he has been castrated. Across the real world men are spending more and more on products with which to feminise themselves, and in bars across the land you find bland boy-band lookalikes from 16 to 60. Everybody, actors included, wants to be Friends. No wonder film director Roman Polanski is having to have open auditions to find a man who looks like a vulnerable, damaged refugee. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Lavant, Auteuil and Lovett show us faces which remind us that beauty is wild, strange, weird, interesting and sometimes very ugly. </p> <p>Faces that just look like human beings. Like themselves. Like men. Like people you want to watch, want to talk to. Their ugliness evokes both reality and imagination: two things so lacking in US culture. </p> <p>Oh, and the other really good thing about ugly men is they don't look prettier than you when you go out together.</p> <p>\u0095 Shane Watson is away.</p>",

Favreau is grateful that fame was elusive: \"Prince William,\" he says, \"is 18, he's on the cover of magazines, and he hasn't done anything. I feel sorry for him. At 30 I was in a movie that brought me a lot of attention, I'm getting to do what I want to do and this is the price I pay for it. And then, I'm in a relationship with a woman I probably wouldn't have met if it hadn't been for Swingers, because that was how she approached me: to discuss that film.\" Doesn't he feel like he's stepped aside from real life? \"Yeah,\" he grins, \"but I never liked the other life that much anyway.\" </p> <p>Favreau's career reads like a boy's fantasy. He was Courteney Cox's millionaire boyfriend in Friends and Cameron Diaz's fiance in Very Bad Things.

Puffy's involvement did mean that New York's clubs were delighted to accommodate Favreau's cameras; on the downside, his time with Puffy proved to him that his Swingers-style party days are numbered. \"It was interesting to get a taste of it,\" he says, \"but I couldn't hang out with him every night.

But it isn't obvious that the gags about crazy people quite come off - of which more in a moment. </p> <p>Jim Carrey gives us his usual body-popping, face-squeezing, crowd-pleasing masterclass in physical comedy. With his open, innocent expression, buzz cut and air of perpetual perplexity, he looks like no one so much as Dick York in the 60s TV show Bewitched. </p> <p>He plays Charlie Baileygates, an all-American white-bread regular guy and Rhode Island state trooper whose life is shattered when his bride falls in love with the, ahem, vertically challenged African-American limo driver who ferries them home from the church. She runs off, leaving Charlie with three black triplets, and Charlie is in denial about his feelings, until they boil over 15 years later in the form of a bizarre split personality. Or, as this film insists on putting it, schizophrenia. Thereafter Charlie's Jekyll and Hyde personalities both fall in love with a young woman called Irene (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger), who is on the run from corrupt federal officials led by the sinister Lt Gerke (a reliably excellent Chris Cooper). </p> <p>There is a scene at the very beginning of this film in which the Farrellys' horrible genius is deployed to its fullest. On his wedding day, poor, inoffensive Charlie inadvertently offends his small black driver, who erupts with rage and ends up attacking him with what look like martial-arts nunchakas. Naturally, only a real nincompoop could object to this scene; in its sheer excessive outrageousness, it is brilliant, but it also functions unmistakably as a little pre-emptive strike at any uptight bores who are thinking of whining about offensiveness. Here is a funny black midget, it is saying, and here is a joke about someone accidentally offending him. OK? </p> <p>Then there is the uproarious scene in which Charlie and Irene find a dead cow in the road; trying to carry it out of the way, Charlie discovers it is actually still alive but in agony. So he tries to kill it, first by emptying his pistol into its head and then by strangling it, while the persistent beast moos merrily away. It's inspired in its own delirious way, and let down only by the fact that it is obviously some sort of animatronic cow. </p> <p>The inevitable self-pleasuring scene comes when Irene enters Charlie's hotel room, dismayed to find him with an official police photo of her, surrounded by sticky crumpled tissues and an absurdly large dispenser of hand-cream. This hardly has the inventiveness of the legendary Cameron-Diaz-hair-gel sequence from There's Something About Mary, which was actually a comment of tactless inspiration on the way modern media encourage male consumers literally and figuratively to jerk off over female images like the miraculously beautiful Diaz. But it does have that bull-in-a-china-shop aptness, an acknowledgement of the open secret of adult male masturbation rarely found in any other film of any genre. </p> <p>But now we come back to the \"schizophrenia\" issue, which has had mental health charities up in arms. The split-personality device gives Carrey an opportunity for his usual bravura dual-character playing, in the tradition of the Nutty Professors of Jerry Lewis and Eddie Murphy, and Steve Martin in All of Me. His condition is repeatedly described as \"advanced involuntary schizophrenia\". Do the Farrelly boys realise that \"schizophrenia\" is an ignorant solecism here? Worryingly, the answer isn't clear. </p> <p>The classic definition of a gentleman is someone who never gives offence accidentally. Something similar applies to the Farrellys' brand of non-PC mischief if it is to be successful. But here it looks oddly as if the brothers have simply blundered.

      "body": "<p>The director of Get Carter, one of the hardest, seediest, most brutal depictions of poverty-backdropped criminal life ever committed to celluloid, lives in a lovely cottage deep in rural Dorset. It is hidden away down a rough dirt track, and is surrounded by a large garden with hammocks and apple trees. \"I'm a small man, and quite a gentle one,\" says Mike Hodges, whose most recent film, Croupier, has become an unexpected US success, two years after FilmFour made it clear that they weren't going to help their own product find a distributor in Britain. \"I don't think I've ever punched anyone in my life. But after the success of Carter, women treated me differently. I had criminals come up to me and say, 'Well done for telling it like it is.'

It is hidden away down a rough dirt track, and is surrounded by a large garden with hammocks and apple trees. \"I'm a small man, and quite a gentle one,\" says Mike Hodges, whose most recent film, Croupier, has become an unexpected US success, two years after FilmFour made it clear that they weren't going to help their own product find a distributor in Britain. \"I don't think I've ever punched anyone in my life.

      "bodyText": "There will be a full public inquiry into the crimes of Harold Shipman, the doctor convicted of murdering 15 of his patients by lethal injection, the health secretary Alan Milburn said yesterday. The high court had ordered Mr Milburn to reconsider his decision to hold the inquiry in private and it is likely that the hearing - expected to take months - will be held in Manchester later this year. A chairman has yet to be appointed after Lord Laming, who would have chaired a private hearing, stood down. The families of Shipman's victims and eight national newspapers successfully ar gued that there should be a judicial review of Mr Milburn's decision and in July, Lord Justice Kennedy ruled that holding the inquiry in private would breach section 10 of the European convention on human rights. The health secretary was asked to reconsider. The Department of Health said yesterday the inquiry would be held under the 1921 Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act which gives the chairman legal powers to compel witnesses to appear and recover any documents. Similar hearings were held following the Aberfan and Dunblane disasters. It will look at how Shipman was able to murder patients undetected for years, how he obtained drugs and how he was able to cover his tracks by altering medical records and ensuring patients were cremated without postmortem examinations. Ann Alexander, the solicitor representing 150 families, said she was confident the inquiry would be able to investigate the background to Shipman's murders with the rigour needed to ensure questions were answered and that lessons were learned. But it is unlikely that Shipman, serving 15 life sentences in Frankland Prison, Durham, will be invited to attend the hearing. In January, Shipman, a former GP in Hyde, Greater Manchester, was convicted of the murder of 15 patients by lethal diamorphine injections. Inquests into the deaths of two more patients have recorded verdicts of unlawful killings. A third inquest into the death of Elizabeth Mellor will take place next week. The death toll from Shipman's killing spree could be as high as 200. Ms Alexander said the outcome of the inquiry could have widespread implications for family doctors, coroners and for the police. \"The health secretary has obviously taken the sensible course of action and we will make absolutely sure that no stone will be left unturned,\" she said. \"The inquiry will establish how he was able to get away with killing so many of his patients for so long. It will look at the systems GPs operate within - what controls are in place and how they get hold of drugs.\" She added that the public inquiry would also look at how Shipman was able to kill three more women after an initial police investigation in March 1998 had cleared him of any wrongdoing. Ms Alexander said the relatives of all of the former doctor's victims wanted to hear for themselves what those involved in the Shipman case had to say. She added that she felt sorry for the families who had been through a long criminal trial, then had to wait almost a year before getting a public inquiry. Jane Ashton-Hibbert, whose grandmother Hilda Hibbert, 81, died at her home in Hyde while being treated by Shipman in 1996, said she was delighted with the news. \"I am very pleased and I am glad it is going to be a 1921 Act inquiry,\" she said. \"It is going to be very thorough - it's going to have teeth. I think we feel that if it is in the open, people are more inclined to speak freely.\" Helen Blackwell, whose mother Bertha Moss, 68, died five years ago, said the public inquiry was vital. \"We need to get it out in the open and to know what went wrong.\"",

      "body": "<p>I had to be in London on Wednesday night, but was up at dawn to get the train back to Bournemouth where I meant to catch Charles Kennedy's keynote speech.</p> <p>But a sign at the station said that, thanks to someone breaking a window at MI6 headquarters, the rail system was in chaos.</p> <p>As all stout hearted Britons know, it is our duty to defy this kind of thing and lead our lives as normal. To give in, to cancel our legitimate daily activities, creates a victory for terrorism.</p> <p>On the other hand, I thought, it's only the Liberal Democrats. Who cares? So I stayed to watch it on TV.</p> <p>Mr Kennedy is quite different from his predecessor. Sir Paddy Ashdown spoke as if reading letters of fire rather than an autocue. He was so passionate, so certain, that you felt that if people didn't like what he was saying, he'd descend into the audience and strangle a few of them.</p> <p>Charlie Kennedy, by contrast, is more affable. He looks like Kilroy, or Jerry Springer without the mayhem. You also expect him to drop into the audience, but with a microphone, quizzing people on the topic of the day, such as: \"Men who love goats and the women who stand by them.\"</p> <p>He ran onto the stage as if appearing on a chat show. Naturally he was applauded loudly. \"Quit while you're in front is the feeling I have,\" he said. The audience failed to laugh. (They also failed to laugh at his other \"joke\": \"What's the difference between Jack Straw and Ann Widdecombe? Jack's got an official driver to do his speeding for him; Ann Widdecombe has to speed on her own.\" We've all died on stage at one time or another. It must be awful to do it on live television.)</p> <p>Given that the theme of his speech was connecting with the people, it was odd too that he spent such a long and lyrical passage time saying how splendid it had been to have the prime minister of Belgium at the conference. I wouldn't bank on this for the manifesto. \"We offer you cheap petrol, shorter waiting lists, and a chance to quiz the prime minister of Belgium\" is not going to hold Romsey.</p> <p>But then things improved. There was a fierce attack on the government. \"It's Labour's poverty of ambition which is so remarkable. With a majority of 179, they behave like John Major with a majority of three. All too often they seem scared of their own shadows,\" he said, which struck me as very good way of putting it.</p> <p>Of the chancellor's conversion to high public spending, he said: \"I'd like to think that Gordon saw the light. But the truth is, he felt the heat.\" But this was nothing compared to the liquid spleen he splashed onto the Tories. His eyes went crinkly. His mouth began to work up and down, so that he resembled the comic actor Arthur Mullard.</p> <p>He appealed for middle of the road Tories to join them. \"You have a home here. You will be very, very welcome,\" like the oleaginous owner of a country house hotel.</p> <p>As for William Hague, for whom he seems to have a visceral dislike, \"he jumps in the wrong place, at the wrong time and for the wrong reasons. He is the world's first unpopular populist\". It was a good line, and was accompanied by a look of complete fury. Some of the anger seemed to communicate itself to the audience, and at last the speech began to smoulder.</p> <p>Finally he did plunge into the crowd, and more precisely plunged down to Baroness Williams, with whom a colleague and I shared a very pleasant drink one evening, thus allowing me to say truthfully the unlikely sentence: \"I spent some of the evening propping up the bar with Shirley Williams.\"</p>",

But a sign at the station said that, thanks to someone breaking a window at MI6 headquarters, the rail system was in chaos. As all stout hearted Britons know, it is our duty to defy this kind of thing and lead our lives as normal. To give in, to cancel our legitimate daily activities, creates a victory for terrorism. On the other hand, I thought, it's only the Liberal Democrats. Who cares? So I stayed to watch it on TV. Mr Kennedy is quite different from his predecessor. Sir Paddy Ashdown spoke as if reading letters of fire rather than an autocue. He was so passionate, so certain, that you felt that if people didn't like what he was saying, he'd descend into the audience and strangle a few of them. Charlie Kennedy, by contrast, is more affable. He looks like Kilroy, or Jerry Springer without the mayhem. You also expect him to drop into the audience, but with a microphone, quizzing people on the topic of the day, such as: \"Men who love goats and the women who stand by them.\" He ran onto the stage as if appearing on a chat show. Naturally he was applauded loudly. \"Quit while you're in front is the feeling I have,\" he said. The audience failed to laugh. (They also failed to laugh at his other \"joke\": \"What's the difference between Jack Straw and Ann Widdecombe? Jack's got an official driver to do his speeding for him; Ann Widdecombe has to speed on her own.\" We've all died on stage at one time or another. It must be awful to do it on live television.) Given that the theme of his speech was connecting with the people, it was odd too that he spent such a long and lyrical passage time saying how splendid it had been to have the prime minister of Belgium at the conference. I wouldn't bank on this for the manifesto. \"We offer you cheap petrol, shorter waiting lists, and a chance to quiz the prime minister of Belgium\" is not going to hold Romsey. But then things improved. There was a fierce attack on the government. \"It's Labour's poverty of ambition which is so remarkable. With a majority of 179, they behave like John Major with a majority of three. All too often they seem scared of their own shadows,\" he said, which struck me as very good way of putting it. Of the chancellor's conversion to high public spending, he said: \"I'd like to think that Gordon saw the light. But the truth is, he felt the heat.\" But this was nothing compared to the liquid spleen he splashed onto the Tories. His eyes went crinkly. His mouth began to work up and down, so that he resembled the comic actor Arthur Mullard. He appealed for middle of the road Tories to join them. \"You have a home here. You will be very, very welcome,\" like the oleaginous owner of a country house hotel. As for William Hague, for whom he seems to have a visceral dislike, \"he jumps in the wrong place, at the wrong time and for the wrong reasons. He is the world's first unpopular populist\". It was a good line, and was accompanied by a look of complete fury. Some of the anger seemed to communicate itself to the audience, and at last the speech began to smoulder. Finally he did plunge into the crowd, and more precisely plunged down to Baroness Williams, with whom a colleague and I shared a very pleasant drink one evening, thus allowing me to say truthfully the unlikely sentence: \"I spent some of the evening propping up the bar with Shirley Williams.\"",

He has confirmed there was no damage inside the Vauxhall Cross building.</p> <p>\"I asked him to commend SIS staff for maintaining business as usual. If the intention of the attackers was to disrupt SIS's operations, they have failed in their objective.\"</p> <p>The prospect of an active terrorist group at large on the mainland, apparently equipped with at least one rocket launcher, prompted an upgrading of security at other security-sensitive buildings. \"London will be policed according to the current threat,\" a spokeswoman said. \"This will include high-visibility policing and appropriate security measures. We would ask the public to remain vigilant and contact police if they notice anything suspicious.\"</p> <p>Although the Real IRA called a ceasefire in the aftermath of the Omagh tragedy, it is now known to be active again and security services in Northern Ireland are on full alert against further attacks.</p> <p>Earlier this month the group was suspected of a mortar attack on the Royal Ulster Constabulary station at Armagh, and also fell under suspicion the previous day when two 80lb bombs were found at a military training camp at Magilligan, County Londonderry.</p> <p>The Real IRA is the largest in a coalition of dissidents, which, security sources estimate, numbers 120 people. But it is unclear how many are either active or potential terrorists.</p> <p>Security sources on both sides of the Irish border spend little time drawing distinctions between the Real IRA, now three years old, Continuity IRA, dating from the Sinn Fein split of 1986, and dissident elements in the Irish National Liberation Army. They believe they switch flags of convenience as it suits.</p> <p>The security forces are also in no doubt that numbers of dissident republicans are growing and their confidence is increasing as well.</p> <p>Attacks such as the one on the MI6 building, although insignificant in the damage it caused, are crucial to the renegade groups as they send a powerful message to terrorists wavering between the political route to a united Ireland or a return to violence that there is an alternative to the Good Friday agreement and that they have the ability to keep the war going.</p> <p>The impetus to dissident republicanism came when the IRA's quartermaster quit the IRA with his partner and a dozen others in the autumn of 1997.</p> <p>They were opposed to Sinn Fein's entry to the talks, and rejected the Good Friday agreement which followed in April 1998.</p> <p>Earlier this week, it was reported that the former IRA leader had disappeared from his normal haunts in the Republic, and may have moved to the British mainland to direct operations. <br><br><b>Quickfire weapon anybody can use</b><br><br> When the gardai raided a wine cellar in a derelict country house 25 miles north of Dublin last October, they realised that the Real IRA had acquired some serious weaponry.</p> <p>The underground bunker was a military training camp and after arresting 10 men, including a 14-year-old, follow-up searches led them to a hay barn.</p> <p>Hidden in pipes beneath the bales was a Russian anti-tank weapon capable of piercing up to 375mm of armour.</p> <p>Though the Provisionals were known to have acquired a number of similar rocket grenade launchers, known as the RPG7, from Libya in the 1980s, this find was different. It was an updated version, the RPG18, manufactured in 1990 and the first weapon of its kind found in the Irish republic.</p> <p>Irish and British intelligence agencies, including MI6, which had been monitoring the travels of two Real IRA members, including its alleged leader, Michael McKevitt from Dundalk, believed they knew where it came from. The new source of weapons was Croatia in the former Yugoslavia, although some reports have suggested that they originated in the first instance in either Serbia or the Kosovo Liberation Army.</p> <p>Further confirmation came in March when a similar weapon, ready for use, was found abandoned near the Killymeal barracks at Dungannon in Co Tyrone, the base of the 3rd battalion the Parachute Regiment.</p> <p>Then, in July, Croatian police raided a number of houses and warehouses in the town of Dobranje near the border with Bosnia and seized an arsenal which they believed were destined for Ireland.</p> <p>The haul included 10 RPG18s.</p> <p>Favoured by terrorists, rebels and irregular forces around the world, the RPGs are relatively cheap and easy to aquire and operate. The RPG18, called the Mukha in Russian, was introduced in the 1970s as a disposable, single-shot anti-tank weapon. It comprises a glass fibre tube with a 64mm rocket and a range of 200m.</p> <p>The high velocity rocket can be launched in seconds. After extending the collapsed tube, the operator places it on his shoulder, lines up the target through a pop-up sight, engages the firing mechanism and pulls the trigger.</p> <p>Writing in a Russian army magazine about \"the fly that flies through armour\" a weapons expert said: \"It could be used by any soldier, even a cook or clerk.\"</p>",

Police are hunting for an active service unit of the Real IRA, who are opposed to the Northern Ireland peace process and were responsible for the August 1998 bomb in Omagh that killed 29 people. The group is believed to have been behind this summer's bomb on Hammersmith Bridge and a device that failed to explode near a railway line in Ealing, west London. But the latest attack on one of the country's most secure buildings represents an escalation in the campaign and has led to security being stepped up for next week's Labour party conference in Brighton. The missile was fired - without any warning - at 9.45pm on Wednesday, slightly damaging a window and two glass screens on the eighth floor of the distinctive cream and green security service building at Vauxhall Cross, south London. Metropolitan police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry described the explosion as \"an audacious attack in one of the busiest parts of London\". Last night Scotland Yard said part of a rocket propelled grenade launcher was found near the MI6 building in Spring Gardens following a painstaking search of the area by police and forensic experts. A police spokeswoman said it was not known if the launcher had been fired from the spot where it was found. \"The launcher is now being examined by experts.

If the intention of the attackers was to disrupt SIS's operations, they have failed in their objective.\" The prospect of an active terrorist group at large on the mainland, apparently equipped with at least one rocket launcher, prompted an upgrading of security at other security-sensitive buildings. \"London will be policed according to the current threat,\" a spokeswoman said. \"This will include high-visibility policing and appropriate security measures. We would ask the public to remain vigilant and contact police if they notice anything suspicious.\" Although the Real IRA called a ceasefire in the aftermath of the Omagh tragedy, it is now known to be active again and security services in Northern Ireland are on full alert against further attacks. Earlier this month the group was suspected of a mortar attack on the Royal Ulster Constabulary station at Armagh, and also fell under suspicion the previous day when two 80lb bombs were found at a military training camp at Magilligan, County Londonderry. The Real IRA is the largest in a coalition of dissidents, which, security sources estimate, numbers 120 people. But it is unclear how many are either active or potential terrorists. Security sources on both sides of the Irish border spend little time drawing distinctions between the Real IRA, now three years old, Continuity IRA, dating from the Sinn Fein split of 1986, and dissident elements in the Irish National Liberation Army. They believe they switch flags of convenience as it suits. The security forces are also in no doubt that numbers of dissident republicans are growing and their confidence is increasing as well. Attacks such as the one on the MI6 building, although insignificant in the damage it caused, are crucial to the renegade groups as they send a powerful message to terrorists wavering between the political route to a united Ireland or a return to violence that there is an alternative to the Good Friday agreement and that they have the ability to keep the war going. The impetus to dissident republicanism came when the IRA's quartermaster quit the IRA with his partner and a dozen others in the autumn of 1997. They were opposed to Sinn Fein's entry to the talks, and rejected the Good Friday agreement which followed in April 1998. Earlier this week, it was reported that the former IRA leader had disappeared from his normal haunts in the Republic, and may have moved to the British mainland to direct operations. Quickfire weapon anybody can use When the gardai raided a wine cellar in a derelict country house 25 miles north of Dublin last October, they realised that the Real IRA had acquired some serious weaponry. The underground bunker was a military training camp and after arresting 10 men, including a 14-year-old, follow-up searches led them to a hay barn. Hidden in pipes beneath the bales was a Russian anti-tank weapon capable of piercing up to 375mm of armour. Though the Provisionals were known to have acquired a number of similar rocket grenade launchers, known as the RPG7, from Libya in the 1980s, this find was different. It was an updated version, the RPG18, manufactured in 1990 and the first weapon of its kind found in the Irish republic. Irish and British intelligence agencies, including MI6, which had been monitoring the travels of two Real IRA members, including its alleged leader, Michael McKevitt from Dundalk, believed they knew where it came from. The new source of weapons was Croatia in the former Yugoslavia, although some reports have suggested that they originated in the first instance in either Serbia or the Kosovo Liberation Army. Further confirmation came in March when a similar weapon, ready for use, was found abandoned near the Killymeal barracks at Dungannon in Co Tyrone, the base of the 3rd battalion the Parachute Regiment. Then, in July, Croatian police raided a number of houses and warehouses in the town of Dobranje near the border with Bosnia and seized an arsenal which they believed were destined for Ireland. The haul included 10 RPG18s. Favoured by terrorists, rebels and irregular forces around the world, the RPGs are relatively cheap and easy to aquire and operate. The RPG18, called the Mukha in Russian, was introduced in the 1970s as a disposable, single-shot anti-tank weapon. It comprises a glass fibre tube with a 64mm rocket and a range of 200m. The high velocity rocket can be launched in seconds. After extending the collapsed tube, the operator places it on his shoulder, lines up the target through a pop-up sight, engages the firing mechanism and pulls the trigger. Writing in a Russian army magazine about \"the fly that flies through armour\" a weapons expert said: \"It could be used by any soldier, even a cook or clerk.\"",

Yet the legal system makes it almost impossible for the public to examine the judges' personal or religious views - views which might influence their outlook. British law insists that a judge's \"religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, age, class, means or sexual orientation\" should not be a factor in deciding whether he or she is fit to hear a case.

A father of three sons and one daughter, Lord Justice Brooke is a former chairman of the Law Commission who became a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1996. He brought religion into the case when he pointed out that much of today's law is founded on case law made by judges \"long ago\" who based their findings on Judaeo-Christian principles.

It said it could not finish the project on its own and that it would have to be bailed out. </p> <p>Robin Gisby, Railtrack's director of network development, said Railtrack would have to make the investment before it could recoup the money, and the railway would have to be tested. \"It is not just being handed over to us and we are told to get on with it.\" </p> <p>He explained that when the original \u00a32.2bn project was begun the Treasury put \u00a31.4bn into the scheme, \"so there has always been some element of public involvement\". </p> <p>The \u00a34bn of state funds is being held by Sir Alastair Morton at the SSRA. A spokesman pointed out that a small part of this money would be set aside for signalling and safety on other parts of the network. </p> <p>Railtrack's revelations took the rail unions by surprise.

      "bodyText": "About \u00a34bn of taxpayers' money has been set aside by the government to ensure Railtrack is able to complete the \u00a35.8bn upgrade of the west coast main line between London and Glasgow, the company admitted to the Guardian last night. The money has been delivered by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, to the industry as part of a \u00a330bn package of investment in rail over the next 10 years. Negotiations are still going on between Gerald Corbett, Railtrack's chief executive, and the shadow Strategic Rail Authority on the exact amount to be paid. But the overall effect will be that two-thirds of the cost of one of the biggest rail infrastructure projects in Europe is being funded by taxpayers. The figure shows that in spite of rail privatisation, the taxpayer is largely responsible for underpinning the railway. Train operating companies are receiving \u00a31.3bn in subsidies which are due to expire in 2002 but will have to be continued beyond that date for large, unprofitable sections of the railway. The cost of the west coast main line project has been a source of embarrassment for Railtrack and the government for some time. Railtrack said yesterday that the cost had more than doubled from \u00a32.2bn when it was started several years ago to \u00a35.8bn when it is due for completion in 2005. Earlier this year the company quietly admitted that the costs were spiralling. It said it could not finish the project on its own and that it would have to be bailed out. Robin Gisby, Railtrack's director of network development, said Railtrack would have to make the investment before it could recoup the money, and the railway would have to be tested. \"It is not just being handed over to us and we are told to get on with it.\" He explained that when the original \u00a32.2bn project was begun the Treasury put \u00a31.4bn into the scheme, \"so there has always been some element of public involvement\". The \u00a34bn of state funds is being held by Sir Alastair Morton at the SSRA. A spokesman pointed out that a small part of this money would be set aside for signalling and safety on other parts of the network. Railtrack's revelations took the rail unions by surprise. Vernon Hince, assistant gen eral secretary of the RMT rail union, said that it exposed the industry's foolishness. \"It is outrageous that the government is being forced to subsidise a private company which makes millions in profits and distributes millions to its shareholders.\" Mr Hince said that the disclosure also called into question the proposals for part-privatisation of the London Underground. The 400-mile west coast line, linking the most populated parts of Britain, is being redeveloped for the first time in 30 years. It is planned that the line will be used by tilting trains, operated by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin company, capable of achieving speeds of 140mph. But there are now doubts this will happen. Virgin is confident that Rail track will be able to deliver the first phase of the deal - with tilting trains running at speeds of 125mph by 2002 - cutting the journey time between London and Manchester to around two hours. But bad planning and Railtrack's over-ambitious reliance on a new signalling system could upset the second phase. Railtrack has even suggested that it would pay Virgin up to \u00a3250m to withdraw from the construction project, but the Branson organisation has rejected the idea. Thousands of passengers along the route constantly suffer the side-effects of the upgrade work. Trains frequently run late, or are cancelled. Railtrack says it will get worse before it gets better but that when the route is finished it will be fast and efficient.",

The bigger political challenge - which looks near impossible - is how to convince the British public that, at the very least, it should allow scientists the opportunity to find out what impact GM crops have on the environment. Norfolk crown court's jury showed how profound the public's unease is. There is little point arguing that this depth of feeling obviously owes much to the catastrophe of BSE, or that other agricultural innovations in the past 50 years - such as the use of pesticides - have caused far worse environmental damage. The opposition is stubborn and incidents such as the GM rape crops inadvertently planted earlier this year and then destroyed only reinforce the belief that this technology is impossible to control. Once again, sharply on the heels of the fuel crisis, the limits of government power have been starkly exposed by a small, committed group who can call on unexpected reserves of support among the general public. In a final irony, it was the very group that last week defied the law outside oil refinery gates, the farmers, who this week are busy asserting the rule of law.",

      "body": "<p>Edited extracts from Charles Kennedy's speech in Bournemouth yesterday:</p> <p>Potentially, politics is at a crossroads. We saw that last week. The opinion polls have recorded that this week. That's been the backdrop for this, I think, one of our most successful conferences ever. Politics is about leading. But politics is also about listening. The events of the past 10 days, have demonstrated, graphically, that the current government, neither leads nor listens enough.</p> <p>People want a better level of political dialogue. Just look at the crime debate. Ann Widdecombe and Jack Straw. They're competing in a dismal Dutch auction. Going for lowest common denominator politics. Over-claim. Over-blame. Over-reach. Undermine the entire point of the political process along the way.</p> <p>Let me be quite clear. I'm not one of those who believe that all Britain's problems began on the first of May 1997. But Labour's poverty of ambition is quite remarkable. With a parliamentary majority - of 179, they behave like John Major did - with a majority of three.</p> <p><b> Ethical</b><br></p> <p>It's all about what will play well in the opinion polls. Britain was promised an ethical foreign policy. Britain demands legislation on the arms trade. But instead we get arms sales to Indonesia.</p> <p>And all too often, they seem scared of their own shadows. Remember that leaked prime ministerial memo? What was it he said? \"A sense that the government ... are somehow out of touch with gut British instincts\".</p> <p>So I ask you, Labour voter last time, maybe for the first time was it? Did you believe, that things could only get better? And have they? Millions of people believed it. Millions of people are disappointed.</p> <p>The Conservatives won't improve these things for you. But the Liberal Democrats can. We can improve a lot on Labour. They are continually terrified to be called the party of boom and bust. That old Labour habit of splashing out in their first years in power, and then having to cut back at the end. Gordon Brown certainly hasn't done that. He's cut back and now he's splashing out. Bust followed by pre-election boom. We said that wasn't good enough. I'd like to think he saw the light. But the truth is, he felt the heat.</p> <p>Now what of the Conservative party? Today, I want to address the millions of previous Conservative voters, who feel that William Hague's party offers them - nothing. I share many of the values, the beliefs, the concerns, of the people who used to be called One Nation Conservatives. Tolerance, decency, fair play.</p> <p>If you believe in those things, and you look at your party. And it's not got room any more, at the top table, for the likes of Ken Clarke, Michael Heseltine, Chris Patten. Then your party's got no room for you.</p> <p>To you, I say this. You have friends in the Liberal Democrats. Come and talk to us. You will be very, very welcome. What's gone wrong with the Conservative party - oh, so wrong - is not even so much the individuals, it's the issues and the instincts which today guide William Hague's Conservative party.</p> <p>William jumps in with both feet, in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and for the wrong reasons. Desperate for a headline, desperate for a quote. Desperate to get attention. He's the world's first unpopular populist.</p> <p>So how come the Tories have come up in the polls? I know the answer. It's not William's popularity. It's the people round about him that the country's warming to.

      "bodyText": "Edited extracts from Charles Kennedy's speech in Bournemouth yesterday: Potentially, politics is at a crossroads. We saw that last week. The opinion polls have recorded that this week. That's been the backdrop for this, I think, one of our most successful conferences ever. Politics is about leading. But politics is also about listening. The events of the past 10 days, have demonstrated, graphically, that the current government, neither leads nor listens enough. People want a better level of political dialogue. Just look at the crime debate. Ann Widdecombe and Jack Straw. They're competing in a dismal Dutch auction. Going for lowest common denominator politics. Over-claim. Over-blame. Over-reach. Undermine the entire point of the political process along the way. Let me be quite clear. I'm not one of those who believe that all Britain's problems began on the first of May 1997. But Labour's poverty of ambition is quite remarkable. With a parliamentary majority - of 179, they behave like John Major did - with a majority of three. Ethical It's all about what will play well in the opinion polls. Britain was promised an ethical foreign policy. Britain demands legislation on the arms trade. But instead we get arms sales to Indonesia. And all too often, they seem scared of their own shadows. Remember that leaked prime ministerial memo? What was it he said? \"A sense that the government ... are somehow out of touch with gut British instincts\". So I ask you, Labour voter last time, maybe for the first time was it? Did you believe, that things could only get better? And have they? Millions of people believed it. Millions of people are disappointed. The Conservatives won't improve these things for you. But the Liberal Democrats can. We can improve a lot on Labour. They are continually terrified to be called the party of boom and bust. That old Labour habit of splashing out in their first years in power, and then having to cut back at the end. Gordon Brown certainly hasn't done that. He's cut back and now he's splashing out. Bust followed by pre-election boom. We said that wasn't good enough. I'd like to think he saw the light. But the truth is, he felt the heat. Now what of the Conservative party? Today, I want to address the millions of previous Conservative voters, who feel that William Hague's party offers them - nothing. I share many of the values, the beliefs, the concerns, of the people who used to be called One Nation Conservatives. Tolerance, decency, fair play. If you believe in those things, and you look at your party. And it's not got room any more, at the top table, for the likes of Ken Clarke, Michael Heseltine, Chris Patten. Then your party's got no room for you. To you, I say this. You have friends in the Liberal Democrats. Come and talk to us. You will be very, very welcome. What's gone wrong with the Conservative party - oh, so wrong - is not even so much the individuals, it's the issues and the instincts which today guide William Hague's Conservative party. William jumps in with both feet, in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and for the wrong reasons. Desperate for a headline, desperate for a quote. Desperate to get attention. He's the world's first unpopular populist. So how come the Tories have come up in the polls? I know the answer. It's not William's popularity. It's the people round about him that the country's warming to. It must be John Redwood, Michael Portillo and Ann Widdecombe the country loves. Just look at what William's been up to this year. January -patient's guarantee. Ditched. February - tax guarantee. Ditched. March - the moral case for low taxation. Ditched with the tax guarantee. April - bogus asylum seekers. May - Romsey. June. He was quiet in June. Perhaps he had a 14-pint hangover. Or perhaps it was that Romsey hangover. Record Remember their record? Recessions. Crime doubled. Larger class sizes. Fewer nurses.

      "body": "<p>The night in Belgrade belongs to the dogs - 60,000 of them now run wild because people can no longer afford to feed them. The city authorities are so broke that they frequently run out of drugs to put them down. So the dogs are clubbed to death instead. In the early morning the smell of freshly rotting rubbish hangs in the streets.</p> <p>Yugoslavia's presidential elections take place on Sunday and the polls predict that Vojislav Kostunica, a previously unknown lawyer, will beat Slobodan Milosevic - despite the election rigging that Milosevic is famous for, and despite the fact that in Serbia nobody ever wins elections except Milosevic. But if Kostunica wins, it's likely that Milosevic will simply use the media he controls to declare victory anyway. He could do that as early as 10 o'clock on Sunday night, just two hours after the polls close and even before the polling boxes make it to the central sorting office. Welcome to Serbia 2000, where Serbs again will be left with no option but to go out on the streets. But the question is how many still have the energy left to go out and protest again.</p> <p>In the winter of 1996, 50,000 people came out to protest against the rigged local elections, and the police special forces crushed them. They were crushed again in March this year when they came out against him on the anniversary of the war in Kosovo. And on Sunday, Milosevic fights not just for his political future, but to avoid spending the rest of his life in the Dutch seaside prison where the international court in the Hague sends its guilty men. \"If we win, it will be great,\" said one of his long-time party workers. \"If we lose, they will lynch us.\"</p> <p>There are 120,000 police at Milosevic's disposal, and all holiday leave has been cancelled. They will do the job they have done in previous protests.</p> <p>On Planet Serbia, closed off from the world, hundreds of thousands of people have turned the frustration and anger of Milosevic's last 12 years of rule into hatred for both him and his wife. He has been the force behind the three bloody wars - in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo - as he tried to use nationalism to secure his own political future. Milosevic, the puppetmaster of the Balkans, has led his people into the wilderness, turning Serbs into international outcasts. A million of them were driven from their homes in those wars, and before their eyes, Yugoslavia, once the wealthiest, healthiest and most beautiful country in eastern Europe, has shrunk from 250,000 square kilometres of sea and mountains to a violent ghetto a quarter that size.</p> <p>Milosevic will be 60 next birthday. His only vices - apart from an obsession with remaining in power - are whisky and Cuban cigars. Both he and his wife have tragic personal histories. His father, a teacher, shot himself when Milosevic was 21. His mother, also a teacher, killed herself 10 years later. But a former Yugoslav ambassador once said that \"in his presence you can feel his strength of personality. You just feel yourself shrinking down in the armchair when he begins to talk. He is a powerful man\". Richard Holbrooke, who chaired the Dayton peace talks in 1995, said he had a great sense of humour; even the waitresses in the Dayton airbase canteen were charmed by him.</p> <p>He met his wife, Mira Markovic, at school in Pozarevac. Her mother was tortured and executed by the Gestapo in 1944 as one of Tito's partisans. They have two children: Marija, a 34-year-old former journalist; and Marko, a 26-year-old former racing driver who runs his own Milosevic mafia in their home town.</p> <p>In the foyer of a Belgrade police station a nurse is trying to sort out her papers and wants to know if there are any jobs in England so she can get out of \"this madhouse\" before the elections. Behind the desk a fat, almost friendly policeman is frowning into his big yellowing ledger. He sits behind chocolate-coloured tinted glass; a full ashtray and grubby overflowing trays of carbon-copied identity papers. It's like being in eastern Europe in 1989.</p> <p>Kostunica, who presents the first real political challenge to Milosevic, is a former communist but a man with clean hands and no past. The only dirt the regime has managed to get on him is to accuse him of keeping 17 cats - which, according to an editorial in Milosevic's paper Politika, shows that, like the average cat, he is untrustworthy and selfish. The editorial also said that he is supported by \"Gays, lesbians and feminists\".</p> <p>On each of the 10 floors of my apartment block \"Gotov Je\" - he's finished - is plastered above the door of the lift. The opposition movement now claims to have 100,000 activists campaigning against Milosevic, but he is far from finished. Until election day he is fighting for his political life, primarily through the TV station he took over 13 years ago when he first came to power.</p> <p>We are watching the news in a top-floor flat. Outside, across the city's skyline, most of the damage done in Nato's 74 days of bombing has disappeared. The news begins with an eight-minute item about the reopening of the chemical plant outside Belgrade. We see a crowd of slightly distracted looking workers shouting \"Slobo, Slobo\". The next 12 minutes are election speeches from around the country with \"Slobo, Slobo\" being chanted constantly in the background. The captain of the national volleyball team calls on people to vote for Milosevic. One hour into the news and they move on to the 100,000 houses that Milosevic will build in the next 10 years.</p> <p>Sylvia, the mother of the house, stands up. \"I can't watch it. I hate him. I could kill him with my bare hands.\" She is 40 years old and has a masters degree in engineering. \"He stole the best years of my life. We have no money, my car is 13 years old. I survive by smuggling sanitary towels and chocolate from Romania. If he wins again there is no future for us.\"</p> <p>Sylvia escapes to the kitchen. The news goes on about another new electricity plant being opened; then finally there's a mention of the opposition. They are all \"fifth columnists\" and \"traitors\". The hour and 48 minutes of Milosevic propaganda mentions his name more than 40 times and ends with the news that he is leading the \"global battle against the agents of fascism\".</p> <p>Milosevic controls all the media, allowing only a few independents to preach to the converted in Belgrade. The rest of the country receive only his message, and it has worked. The latest polls say that Milosevic could legitimately poll more than 1.5m votes and Kostunica is expected to win by as few as 700,000. But Milosevic is free to fix the ballot in Serb regions of Kosovo and the sister state of Montenegro.</p> <p>His biggest supporters are among the old former communists who hark back to Tito, like 64-year-old Dorde Erdeljan and his 61-year-old wife Stava. They say they watch the news every night - never miss it. \"If it wasn't for Milosevic being so strong we would have had Nato troops on the streets of Belgrade,\" says Dorde. \"Kostunica's coalition are traitors who would betray our country.\" Instead of blaming Milosevic for the hardships of the past 10 years, they point to sanctions and a western conspiracy. \"Look at what happened in Britain over the petrol prices - your country would have collapsed in six months if you had to put up with what Serbia has been forced to suffer.\"</p> <p>The only dissenter on the street is Dobrivoic Radanovic, a 50-year-old former boxer and mechanic. \"Of course I'm voting for the opposition. The only people who won't are the old, the army and police.\"</p> <p>\"What will happen then?\"</p> <p>\"Nothing. People will protest and that will be it. The police will crush them and that will be it. We are a special people, the Serbs. The Turks ruled us and we got used to being oppressed.\"</p> <p>Jovan Dulovic works for the small independent magazine Vreme. He specialises in police affairs. \"The special intervention force can be in Belgrade in a few hours. They are the cream of the force, usually athletes and young guys who do weights. In any normal country of our size the police force should be about 30,000; here we've got 120,000. If the people keep going on the streets, the police will beat them. I don't expect them to do anything immediately - he will wait to see how the protests go. Then if they continue it will be very brutal.\"</p> <p>Milosevic is on the campaign trail, appearing at organised mass rallies. On Monday night, the TV broadcasts a ceremony showing 10,089 people gathering to join his party. Each was presented with a red rose and given 100 German marks for turning up. \"We are living through some sort of tragic comic opera which might look funny but it is very, very dangerous,\" says Lubodrag Stojadivovic, a former spokesman for the Yugoslav army who was sacked for writing an open letter protesting about political interference, especially by Milosevic's wife in the army.</p> <p>I think it is possible that the police will be used in a massive and brutal way. If that doesn't work his last card will be the army, but that is a very dangerous card to play - no matter what the generals say, the soldiers will not go against the people.\"</p> <p>The town where Milosevic and his wife began their lives looks like a pleasant place in the early autumn. All along the main street there are white banners in red letters that read \"Choose people not Nato\" and \"For Yugoslavia\". There's not a single poster or banner for the opposition in sight. The chestnut trees in the square were turning red when Markovic went there last week to address a public rally calling on her town and her nation to support her husband.</p> <p>\"Only about 2,000 people turned up,\" says Mile Yeljkovic, a journalist with Beta, the independent newsagency. \"Even those people were bused in. I heard afterwards that she was in tears, she couldn't believe there were so few people.\"</p> <p>On Sunday, and in the days that follow, Serbia will find out what they already know - that Milosevic will play God to the end. He has no choice. Perhaps that's why this city of Belgrade on this warm September day is full mostly of exhaustion and despair. \"Pandora's box has been opened and the only thing left inside for us now is hope,\" said a beautiful student, plastering opposition posters on a baker's wall. She is 19, and not so tired.</p> <p><b>Life and times of Milosevic</b></p> <p><b> Born:</b><br> August 29 1941, in Pozarevac, Serbia. Following the suicide of his father in 1962, Milosevic was raised by his mother, who also killed herself in 1973.</p> <p><b> Early years:</b> <br>Graduated in law from Belgrade University in 1964 and pursued a business career. He was chief of the state-owned gas company Technogas 1968-78, and member of the board of directors of Beobank (United Bank of Belgrade) 1978-82.</p> <p><b> Political career:</b> <br>Joined the communist party of Yugoslavia when he was 18. Entered politics in 1984. In 1987 he became leader of the Serbian communists. Elected president of the Serbian Republic in 1989. The following year he turned the League of Communists of Serbia into the Socialist party of Serbia and was returned to power in the election of December 1990.</p> <p><b> Croatia:</b><br> Serb forces bombard cities including Dubrovnik and Vukovar as the conflict escalates in 1991. Croatian independence recognised by the EC the following year.</p> <p><b> Bosnia-Herzegovina: </b><br> International recognition of the area as an independent state in April 1992 leads to civil war. Thousands of Muslims massacred by Serbs at Srebrenica in the summer of 1995. Milosevic agrees to peace in the Dayton accord in November of that year.</p> <p><b> Kosovo:</b> <br>The 1998 offensive by Serb forces against the Kosovo Liberation Army leads to the 78-day bombing of Serbia by Nato forces, March to June 1999, which ends when Milosevic agrees to withdraw his troops.</p>",

The opposition movement now claims to have 100,000 activists campaigning against Milosevic, but he is far from finished. Until election day he is fighting for his political life, primarily through the TV station he took over 13 years ago when he first came to power. We are watching the news in a top-floor flat. Outside, across the city's skyline, most of the damage done in Nato's 74 days of bombing has disappeared. The news begins with an eight-minute item about the reopening of the chemical plant outside Belgrade. We see a crowd of slightly distracted looking workers shouting \"Slobo, Slobo\". The next 12 minutes are election speeches from around the country with \"Slobo, Slobo\" being chanted constantly in the background. The captain of the national volleyball team calls on people to vote for Milosevic. One hour into the news and they move on to the 100,000 houses that Milosevic will build in the next 10 years. Sylvia, the mother of the house, stands up. \"I can't watch it. I hate him. I could kill him with my bare hands.\" She is 40 years old and has a masters degree in engineering. \"He stole the best years of my life. We have no money, my car is 13 years old. I survive by smuggling sanitary towels and chocolate from Romania. If he wins again there is no future for us.\" Sylvia escapes to the kitchen. The news goes on about another new electricity plant being opened; then finally there's a mention of the opposition. They are all \"fifth columnists\" and \"traitors\". The hour and 48 minutes of Milosevic propaganda mentions his name more than 40 times and ends with the news that he is leading the \"global battle against the agents of fascism\". Milosevic controls all the media, allowing only a few independents to preach to the converted in Belgrade. The rest of the country receive only his message, and it has worked. The latest polls say that Milosevic could legitimately poll more than 1.5m votes and Kostunica is expected to win by as few as 700,000. But Milosevic is free to fix the ballot in Serb regions of Kosovo and the sister state of Montenegro. His biggest supporters are among the old former communists who hark back to Tito, like 64-year-old Dorde Erdeljan and his 61-year-old wife Stava. They say they watch the news every night - never miss it. \"If it wasn't for Milosevic being so strong we would have had Nato troops on the streets of Belgrade,\" says Dorde. \"Kostunica's coalition are traitors who would betray our country.\" Instead of blaming Milosevic for the hardships of the past 10 years, they point to sanctions and a western conspiracy. \"Look at what happened in Britain over the petrol prices - your country would have collapsed in six months if you had to put up with what Serbia has been forced to suffer.\" The only dissenter on the street is Dobrivoic Radanovic, a 50-year-old former boxer and mechanic. \"Of course I'm voting for the opposition. The only people who won't are the old, the army and police.\" \"What will happen then?\" \"Nothing. People will protest and that will be it. The police will crush them and that will be it. We are a special people, the Serbs. The Turks ruled us and we got used to being oppressed.\" Jovan Dulovic works for the small independent magazine Vreme. He specialises in police affairs. \"The special intervention force can be in Belgrade in a few hours. They are the cream of the force, usually athletes and young guys who do weights. In any normal country of our size the police force should be about 30,000; here we've got 120,000. If the people keep going on the streets, the police will beat them. I don't expect them to do anything immediately - he will wait to see how the protests go. Then if they continue it will be very brutal.\" Milosevic is on the campaign trail, appearing at organised mass rallies. On Monday night, the TV broadcasts a ceremony showing 10,089 people gathering to join his party. Each was presented with a red rose and given 100 German marks for turning up. \"We are living through some sort of tragic comic opera which might look funny but it is very, very dangerous,\" says Lubodrag Stojadivovic, a former spokesman for the Yugoslav army who was sacked for writing an open letter protesting about political interference, especially by Milosevic's wife in the army. I think it is possible that the police will be used in a massive and brutal way. If that doesn't work his last card will be the army, but that is a very dangerous card to play - no matter what the generals say, the soldiers will not go against the people.\" The town where Milosevic and his wife began their lives looks like a pleasant place in the early autumn. All along the main street there are white banners in red letters that read \"Choose people not Nato\" and \"For Yugoslavia\". There's not a single poster or banner for the opposition in sight. The chestnut trees in the square were turning red when Markovic went there last week to address a public rally calling on her town and her nation to support her husband. \"Only about 2,000 people turned up,\" says Mile Yeljkovic, a journalist with Beta, the independent newsagency. \"Even those people were bused in. I heard afterwards that she was in tears, she couldn't believe there were so few people.\" On Sunday, and in the days that follow, Serbia will find out what they already know - that Milosevic will play God to the end. He has no choice. Perhaps that's why this city of Belgrade on this warm September day is full mostly of exhaustion and despair. \"Pandora's box has been opened and the only thing left inside for us now is hope,\" said a beautiful student, plastering opposition posters on a baker's wall. She is 19, and not so tired. Life and times of Milosevic Born: August 29 1941, in Pozarevac, Serbia. Following the suicide of his father in 1962, Milosevic was raised by his mother, who also killed herself in 1973. Early years: Graduated in law from Belgrade University in 1964 and pursued a business career. He was chief of the state-owned gas company Technogas 1968-78, and member of the board of directors of Beobank (United Bank of Belgrade) 1978-82. Political career: Joined the communist party of Yugoslavia when he was 18. Entered politics in 1984. In 1987 he became leader of the Serbian communists. Elected president of the Serbian Republic in 1989. The following year he turned the League of Communists of Serbia into the Socialist party of Serbia and was returned to power in the election of December 1990. Croatia: Serb forces bombard cities including Dubrovnik and Vukovar as the conflict escalates in 1991. Croatian independence recognised by the EC the following year. Bosnia-Herzegovina: International recognition of the area as an independent state in April 1992 leads to civil war. Thousands of Muslims massacred by Serbs at Srebrenica in the summer of 1995. Milosevic agrees to peace in the Dayton accord in November of that year. Kosovo: The 1998 offensive by Serb forces against the Kosovo Liberation Army leads to the 78-day bombing of Serbia by Nato forces, March to June 1999, which ends when Milosevic agrees to withdraw his troops.",

The Belfast company is still claiming \u00a3133m for excess costs caused by alleged changes to specification. The firm, which failed to win Cunard's contract for a new Queen Mary in March, said redundancies were necessary to meet financial problems which prevented it winning orders. The news provoked union anger, with the GMB demanding government intervention to support British yards.",

Simon Hughes, the party's home affairs spokesman, said the use of \"indefinite sentences\" would not necessarily mean prisoners gained longer sentences, but there would be a more controlled release of them into society. Serious sex offenders would be given a minimum tariff, but it would be up to judges to assess whether satisfactory arrangements had been made for them to be let out. Mr Hughes' call for a review of the current sentencing policy came as the party addressed an issue which has been a national preoccupation following the abduction and murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne in July. There has been strong pressure for a \"Sarah's law\" which would allow parents access to the sex offenders' register. Earlier this month the government ruled this out, but introduced other proposals, including fingerprinting and photographing offenders on their release and life bans on them contacting their victims. Indefinite sentences are not an option at present unless a serious sex offender has re-offended, but the Home Office is looking at applying this to a small number of extremely dangerous sex offenders under separate legislation. Yesterday Liberal Democrats called for \"serious consideration\" to be given to this measure, and called for the victims of sex offenders to be told where and when their abusers would be released.

      "bodyText": "Lord Falconer faced fresh calls for his resignation last night after the Millennium Dome's financial director quit, the latest victim of Greenwich project. Accountant Neil Spence stepped down after a damning report uncovered a \"black hole\" when it was forced on the verge of bankruptcy to seek another \u00a347m aid from the millennium commission. An independent study discovered no proper record had been kept of contracts or assets, and his role was effectively taken over by a team brought in by City troubleshooter, David James. But the New Millennium Experience Company's decision to continue paying Mr Spence's \u00a3127,700 salary until December 31 was criticised by opposition MPs, who also demanded Lord Falconer's head. Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrats' dome spokesman, said: \"It is incredible Mr Spence can resign and yet continue to draw a salary. Lord Falconer really has to go, and it is clear he is simply staying put to provide a shield for Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson.\" Mr Spence's future as finance director was in doubt after Mr James was appointed three weeks ago. The chaotic state of the dome's finances was thrown into relief when Japanese bank Nomura pulled out of its proposed \u00a3105m bid to buy the Greenwich site.",

Diplomats are uncertain how the president will play the election and are unwilling to speculate on his options or their reactions. The only certainties are that Mr Milosevic called the polls early thinking he would win easily because of the opposition's disunity, and that he is as surprised as any one by his opponents' strength. The International Crisis Group, a think-tank that aims to strengthen the capacity of the international community to anticipate conflict, and which has good contacts in Washington and London, this week outlined four scenarios for Sunday's poll. Fearing defeat, the Yugoslav president may call it off after \"provoking some sort of internal crisis through a staged terrorist attack or simulated military coup, or major disruption in Montenegro\".

But already one Times reader isn't a fan. Alex Clarke wrote to young Giles opining that the Times Diary was now worse then ever. Sadly, Giles did not take this criticism at all well, and spent the rest of the day ringing Alex, trying vainly to find out his home address and complaining to Alex's employers (\"Can't you give him more work to do or something?\" he whined). The emails continued, and Mr Clarke reached for the \"nuclear option\": he threatened to pass the correspondence on to this Diary. \"The Guardian isn't going to print a story about a diarist on another paper who is pissed off about a grumpy reader,\" Giles rather too confidently replied. \"You'll be glad to know that my diary will be shitter [sic] than ever today because I've spent more time emailing you and being pissed off about you than I have on anything else,\" is Giles's farewell on the subject. And that's only Giles's third day on the job.</p> <p>\u0095Following on from the Buxton pub that imposed a 10-pint limit during the fuel crisis, a pub in nearby Leek has a sign: \"Fluid Crisis - No Shortage\".</p> <p>\u0095Brighton readers with a spare room and a kind heart might consider helping out Newsnight staff caught out by an accommodation drought at next week's Labour party conference. A memo circulated this week asking reporters covering the conference to stay with family and friends hasn't gone down well. Among the disgruntled staff is Jeremy Paxman, who looks likely to be accommodated in the less than nearby Gatwick Hilton. So anyone who fancies having Paxo dossing on the sofa, just ring the BBC. (\"I put it to you, Auntie Marge, that I would prefer kippers.\")</p> <p>\u0095A joke has been doing the rounds at the Liberal Democrats conference in Bournemouth - but just the one, mind. The Lib Dems (say wags) used to have a leader who got up at 5am. Now it has a leader who goes to bed at 5am. And anyone who heard Mr Charles Kennedy's virtuoso performance on Radio 4's World at One on Tuesday will know that it hasn't affected him a jot. \u0095As part of their year-late \"peanuts-pension\" campaign, Anthony Bevins in the Daily Express yesterday calculates that the government's \u00a319bn surplus would buy every peanut in the world for the next 18 months. The Express isn't the only paper indulging in totally un-bogus statistical calculations. Last Saturday's Dominion newspaper in New Zealand calculated that the amount spent by rich countries on agricultural subsides each year is enough to buy every cow in the OECD a first-class round the world air ticket, plus spending money. What the cows would spend it on wasn't revealed.</p> <p>\u0095Many of our readers were surprised to learn here yesterday that Mr Tony Blair was writing a leaflet for the Fabian Society called The Case for Socialism. But of course that was a ludicrous suggestion, which happily has turned out not to be true. We apologise to Mr Tony for the idea that he would ever make the case for socialism.

      "bodyText": "\u0095A belated hello! to Giles Coren, who has taken over this week as my so-called rival on the Times (the whisper being that he only got the job because of his famous father, Bernard Levin). But already one Times reader isn't a fan. Alex Clarke wrote to young Giles opining that the Times Diary was now worse then ever. Sadly, Giles did not take this criticism at all well, and spent the rest of the day ringing Alex, trying vainly to find out his home address and complaining to Alex's employers (\"Can't you give him more work to do or something?\" he whined). The emails continued, and Mr Clarke reached for the \"nuclear option\": he threatened to pass the correspondence on to this Diary. \"The Guardian isn't going to print a story about a diarist on another paper who is pissed off about a grumpy reader,\" Giles rather too confidently replied. \"You'll be glad to know that my diary will be shitter [sic] than ever today because I've spent more time emailing you and being pissed off about you than I have on anything else,\" is Giles's farewell on the subject. And that's only Giles's third day on the job. \u0095Following on from the Buxton pub that imposed a 10-pint limit during the fuel crisis, a pub in nearby Leek has a sign: \"Fluid Crisis - No Shortage\". \u0095Brighton readers with a spare room and a kind heart might consider helping out Newsnight staff caught out by an accommodation drought at next week's Labour party conference. A memo circulated this week asking reporters covering the conference to stay with family and friends hasn't gone down well. Among the disgruntled staff is Jeremy Paxman, who looks likely to be accommodated in the less than nearby Gatwick Hilton. So anyone who fancies having Paxo dossing on the sofa, just ring the BBC. (\"I put it to you, Auntie Marge, that I would prefer kippers.\") \u0095A joke has been doing the rounds at the Liberal Democrats conference in Bournemouth - but just the one, mind. The Lib Dems (say wags) used to have a leader who got up at 5am. Now it has a leader who goes to bed at 5am. And anyone who heard Mr Charles Kennedy's virtuoso performance on Radio 4's World at One on Tuesday will know that it hasn't affected him a jot. \u0095As part of their year-late \"peanuts-pension\" campaign, Anthony Bevins in the Daily Express yesterday calculates that the government's \u00a319bn surplus would buy every peanut in the world for the next 18 months. The Express isn't the only paper indulging in totally un-bogus statistical calculations. Last Saturday's Dominion newspaper in New Zealand calculated that the amount spent by rich countries on agricultural subsides each year is enough to buy every cow in the OECD a first-class round the world air ticket, plus spending money. What the cows would spend it on wasn't revealed. \u0095Many of our readers were surprised to learn here yesterday that Mr Tony Blair was writing a leaflet for the Fabian Society called The Case for Socialism. But of course that was a ludicrous suggestion, which happily has turned out not to be true. We apologise to Mr Tony for the idea that he would ever make the case for socialism. He's only writing the foreword to the Fabian pamphlet with the same title. It's only three sentences long, so we were at least right about it being easily reproduced on the back of a stamp. \u0095I can now report on Puppetry of the Penis, the show in which two Australian men create \"installations\" with their genitalia. The climax of the show, the \"Windsurfer\", along with a phalanx of supporting acts such as the Millennium Dome (thankfully sans supporting struts, but no less excruciating than the real thing) was a hands down winner.

      "bodyText": "A serial rapist was yesterday convicted of his third sex attack across a 17 year period, after a law change allowed evidence from five previous rape trials he has faced to be laid before the jury. Nicholas Edwards was jailed for life for the rape of a 23-year-old woman in 1998, after the Old Bailey heard it fitted a pattern consistent with five previous attacks over 14 years. In an unprecedented move, the judge, Leonard Gerber, allowed the jury to hear evidence from four woman who went to court claiming Edwards raped them only to see him acquitted, and from a woman whom he was jailed for raping. Before the trial began, the House of Lords agreed to make a significant change in English criminal law to allow the \"similar fact\" evidence to be put before the jury. But civil liberties campaigners last night warned that the Lords' judgment risked increasing miscarriages of justice. In the charge he faced and in his previous trials, Edwards, 39, had claimed the woman had consented to sex, and juries had to decide between his word and that of the woman. The Old Bailey jury did not hear from another woman whom Edwards had been convicted of raping at knifepoint in 1981, and another whose allegations he was cleared of, as they could not be traced. Edwards was yesterday convicted solely for his attack on a young mother, Miss D, whom he raped in August 1998 in his flat in Sydenham, southeast London. As in previous rape allegations against him, Edwards approached the woman and initially appeared charming. As in at least one other allegation, he called her a \"bitch\" during the attack and ordered her to strip before pinning her under him and forcing her to have unprotected intercourse. With Miss D, Edwards's mood changed in a \"Jekyll and Hyde\" way immediately before the rape, matching the testimony of the five other women. Miss D, who had a five-month-old son, was left so traumatised that she was unable to breast feed her child. She also bathed in bleach and Dettol to try and \"wash him away\". Detective Sergeant Paul Astbury, who led the gathering of evidence, said Edwards had used knowledge gained from his previous trials to rape in a way that minimised his chances of being convicted: \"As he was planning them, he was formulating his own defence ... knowing exactly what it took to get off, knowing exactly what was required for the police to prove his guilt. \"He is one of the most dangerous individuals I have come across. Without the similar fact evidence, the chances of securing a conviction would be less than average.\" Privately, police officers believe he could have raped far more than the eight known about. Another two women have come forward since the Old Bailey trial began. The prosecutor, David Perry QC, reading a victim impact statement from Miss D after the verdict, said: \"She cannot kiss her boyfriend on the lips. She has never kissed anyone on the lips since the rape. She still suffers from flashbacks and nightmares and thinks she has changed since. She cannot get the face of the defendant's face out of her head and has become depressed.\" A 42-year-old woman, Miss R, who saw Edwards's acquitted of charges of raping her in a churchyard in 1991, said she had to testify at the Old Bailey: \"It has got him off the streets before he cannot attack other women. When I heard he had struck again, I wanted to do something to help put this man behind bars. \"He turned from a charming individual into a monster.\" Mary Cuneen, director of policy for the civil rights group Liberty, said: \"The House of Lords judgment goes too far. The facts of this case are obviously horrendous. In effect you are judging somebody's guilt not on the basis of the evidence of the offence they have committed, but on the basis of other matters. \"Clearly there is a strong interest in prosecuting rape cases properly, but there is a danger that the House of Lords has not had proper regard for the principles of general fairness.\" The Lords dismissed defence arguments that allowing similar fact evidence to be heard would be prejudicial. Judge Gerber said Edwards should serve a minimum of seven years imprisonment for attacking Miss D before he could be considered for parole: \"You humiliated her and have not shown one iota of remorse.\" Detective Chief Inspector Jim Webster appealed for any other women with information about Edwards to contact the police.

One had an abortion, one is still haunted by the memory 16 years on, another was never able to breastfeed her child, another is on anti-depressants, another cannot kiss or be kissed on the lips. The legal system that Edwards exploited to get away with a campaign of rape pulled out all the stops to convict him of the eighth sex attack charge he has faced since 1981. Edwards had asked the jury at the Old Bailey to believe that so many women were accusing him of rape because he was \"unlucky\". In a totally different sense to what he meant, he was right. Less than one in 10 rapes reported to police result in conviction. Researchers believe those attacks which are reported also represent a tenth of the real total, meaning the chances of Edwards being convicted yesterday were less than one in100. For 17 years he carried out a string of sex attacks, exploiting his knowledge of the legal system through his seven previous rape trials to gain acquittal. There was inconclusive or no medical or forensic evidence supporting the women's claims. Detective Sergeant Paul Astbury, who built the case against Edwards, said: \"I think the only purpose in his life was sex.\" Police found it hard to piece together a coherent picture of his life. Edwards claimed to have fathered six children, but was never part of a stable family unit. \"What is more frightening is he has integrated into society perfectly normally, he's held down a job, he's fathered children,\" said Mr Astbury. Edwards's family were noticeable by their absence from the three-week trial, with one of his daughters attending briefly. From the witness box Edwards bragged of having lost his virginity at 13. He claimed, police believe falsely, to have slept with 2,000 women, and of having six children with five women. His counsel, Richard Benson QC, said that Edwards had \"the morals of an alley cat\". But Mr Benson continued: \"No matter how much you want to doctor him, you cannot convict him of rape.

They sobbed as they recounted their ordeals. He was convicted for his first rape, committed in 1981 at knifepoint in his car in High Wycombe. He was charged with a total of five rapes carried out while he lived in the town, and for another three after he moved to London, where he worked as a welder. The prosecution strategy that led to the groundbreaking House of Lords ruling was masterminded by Treasury counsel David Perry, representing the crown. With consent the key issue, it allowed him to argue to the jury that his case relied on more than Miss D's word against Edwards's. It allowed him to say the attack on Miss D fitted Edwards's method of raping. Mr Perry listed 18 similarities between the various rape cases, among them the fact that Edwards maintained they all consented to sex; that victims spoke of him \"engineering\" the initial meeting; that he took them out on a date; that they described him as \"friendly and charming\"; and that he \"flipped\" very quickly from being pleasant to an \"aggressive and intimidating person'\" Edwards also ordered the women to strip; the victims all talked of being \"frozen\" with fear; Edwards was always in control of the situation, ordering his victims to move their bodies as if it was normal intercourse; Edwards never used contraception; once intercourse was over \"he reverted to his former self\" and there was conversation from him as if nothing untoward had happened. Twice Edwards called the victims \"bitches\", twice he said there was no point in them screaming because no one would hear.

Considering the rape of Miss D, the jury decided there was too much coincidence in the torrid life of Nicholas Edwards. Several women said that after raping them, he used the identical words, \"I suppose you are going to call this rape\". That is what the jury did.",

On the last day of the party's conference in Bournemouth, Paul Burstow, the Lib Dem spokesman for older people, called on the government to show \"zero tolerance\" to growing evidence of ageism in the health service. Such ageism meant two thirds of kidney patients over the age of 70 had been refused dialysis, while women over 65 were not routinely screened for breast cancer, which could account for two thirds of the victims of the disease being in this age group, he said. \"It's time the government owned up to age based rationing in the NHS,\" Mr Burstow went on. \"We expect health care to be delivered on the basis of need, not on the basis of a person's date of birth.\" The MP for Sutton and Cheam also rounded on Labour for being \"complacent\" in its initial response to the controversy over the resuscitation of frail and elderly patients. In April Age Concern revealed doctors sometimes mark very elderly, terminally ill patients' notes DNR (do not resuscitate) without consulting the patient or relatives. In the event of a heart attack, no attempt is made to keep the patient alive on the basis that prolonging treatment will only lead to further suffering. Earlier this month, the health secretary, Alan Milburn, told NHS trusts that \"blanket\" DNRs on any group of patients - including the elderly - were not allowed, and advised that patients and relatives should be involved in any decisions on the highly sensitive issue. But Mr Burstow criticised ministers for initially insisting BMA guidelines adequately protected patients. This failed to account for the \"chasm\" between recommendations and practice, which meant doctors failed to consult patients in two thirds of cases. The Lib Dems called for a series of measures to stamp out ageism, and improve elderly patients' NHS treatment, including giving them full access to their medical notes and increased accessibility for the over 60s to flu jabs and cancer screening. In an earlier debate a significant spending increase was demanded to tackle \"under-investment\" in the NHS. Nick Harvey, the party's health spokesman, said the proportion of the nation's GDP spent on health must be in creased to at least that of other European countries. \"Only then can we start to address the problems created by 17,000 nurse vacancies and a rate of 1.7 doctors to every 1,000 head of population, compared to a rate of 3.1 in the rest of Europe,\" he insisted. The Liberal Democrats are committed to recruiting an extra 5,000 doctors and 20,000 nurses over three years. One delegate, a nursing auxiliary working in a special care baby unit in Crawley, west Sussex, said staff were leaving the NHS because of poor pay, and pointed out a senior staff nurse earned the same as a print engineer on night shift. \"That's why you are not getting your staff. That's why the (nurses) are leaving in droves.

Mr Shayler, who accuses MI6 of plotting to assassinate the Libyan president, Colonel Gadafy, was informed of a new charge of passing on material obtained through telephone tapping, an offence against section four of the act, at a three minute hearing at Bow Street magistrates' court in central London. The two other charges, of passing information and documents obtained by virtue of being a member of the security and intelligence services, breach section one of the act.

Instead, viewers will be treated to X-rated, hardcore close-ups of flared trousers, satin bomber jackets and knee-length sequinned boots. </p> <p>It is, of course, Abba Day, a scheduling tour de force which will include such treats as Abba Jukebox (a 30-minute showcase of their top ten most popular videos), 100% Abba (a quiz show, all about Abba trivia) and even a one-hour documentary on tribute band Bjorn Again.

Obviously, the hope is that if a viewer is interested in, say, sharks, then they might be interested in any number of different programmes about, um, sharks, but the battle is just the same as with ordinary programming to retain audiences. Industry estimates suggest that viewers will sample any given one-hour programme for, on average, between 17 and 27 minutes before reaching for the remote (or 12 minutes in a half-hour show).

BBC2 had a massive success with its Blue Peter Night, for instance, which garnered over four million eager Shep fans.

Extensive market research, for instance, suggested that Channel 5 was on to a sure-fire winner by staging a dedicated Valentine's Night on February 14 last year. There was an impeccable logic, of course: women love romance and would therefore lap up a mix of slushy movies, documentaries on lurve and a soft-focused mini-series starring several lantern-jawed men. Sadly, the station recorded its worst Sunday night ratings in over two years - it was, concludes Perry, \"the wrong theme for our audience\". </p> <p>BBC2 experienced a similar disappointment when they attempted to capitalise on the Bridget Jones phenomenon and screened a night of dedicated \"singleton\" programming, while Channel 4 did a Stirling Moss evening that (perhaps not surprisingly) attracted just 600,000 viewers across the whole night. \"A theme can turn someone off as much as on,\" concedes Channel 4 spokesman Alan McLaughlin, \"and that's the whole evening gone if it isn't really someone's bag. You've got to be very targeted and you have to know your audience; the timing's got to be right as well as the relevance.\" </p> <p>Since their launch, themes have come in just about every imaginable shape and size. We've had Charlie's Angels nights, we've had something called Wild, Wet And Windy (an entire weekend of programming about freak weather conditions), we've had martial arts specials and even TV Deaths, a rather desperate series featuring the most high-profile exits from the world of telly (kicking off with an intro by Leslie \"Dirty Den\" Grantham filmed in Kensal Rise Cemetery). </p> <p>And now, given their overall success, the word is that we are going to get even more. Channel 5 says it likes to do one a month - \"if not more\" - while Channel 4 says there is \"no set limit\" to the number of zoned evenings it will treat us all to. </p> <p>\"They're great pegs around which to promote,\" says Perry. \"If you have a theme, you can give people a coherence that they want to come to. They're a very, very strong promotional device...\"</p>",

We've had Charlie's Angels nights, we've had something called Wild, Wet And Windy (an entire weekend of programming about freak weather conditions), we've had martial arts specials and even TV Deaths, a rather desperate series featuring the most high-profile exits from the world of telly (kicking off with an intro by Leslie \"Dirty Den\" Grantham filmed in Kensal Rise Cemetery). And now, given their overall success, the word is that we are going to get even more. Channel 5 says it likes to do one a month - \"if not more\" - while Channel 4 says there is \"no set limit\" to the number of zoned evenings it will treat us all to. \"They're great pegs around which to promote,\" says Perry. \"If you have a theme, you can give people a coherence that they want to come to. They're a very, very strong promotional device...\"",

      "byline": "Stephen Moss",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Why does Andrew Lloyd Webber generate such loathing? A friend, on hearing that I was interviewing him, told me she would never speak to me again if I said he was a good composer. He was, she insisted, a borrower of other people's tunes and Rachmaninov should have got a royalty for Aspects of Love. Victor Lewis-Smith, the scabrous TV critic of the London Evening Standard, said much the same thing this week, adding for good measure that Lord L-W was \"plug ugly\". </p> <p>The latter can be quickly dealt with: he isn't particularly. He would be the first to admit that he is no oil painting, but then neither is Lewis-Smith. The music is trickier. There are clearly many influences on Lloyd Webber's tunes and you often feel you've heard them somewhere before, but nothing has ever been proved and litigants who have pursued him on grounds of plagiarism have always lost. </p> <p>Lloyd Webber's new show, The Beautiful Game, opens next Tuesday at London's Cambridge Theatre. It marks a key moment in his career, because his last two shows - Sunset Boulevard and Whistle Down the Wind - failed to set the West End on fire and only two years ago he appeared to be on the point of abandoning musicals. \"I thought I'd write an art book or something,\" he said. </p> <p>That was before a dinner with Ben Elton that, in the best let's-do-the-show-right-here traditions, changed everything. \"I thought I was beginning to tread water a bit with Whistle Down the Wind,\" Lloyd Webber told me when we met at the Really Useful Group's really lovely office in Soho. \"So when Ben said he would be interested in writing with me it was a breath of fresh air. If musical theatre is to have a relevance, from time to time we have to take on subjects that are challenging, or we might as well be doing nothing but revivals. You can't go on looking back, and maybe I'm guilty of having looked back a little bit myself in one or two of my recent things. Now I feel refreshed.\" </p> <p>In late 1998, Lloyd Webber had approached Elton to provide some new material for Starlight Express. Elton said no to that but suggested, as the wine flowed, that they collaborate on a contemporary piece. Lloyd Webber recalled seeing a TV programme about a group of Irish youngsters who played in a non-sectarian football team and, a few weeks later, Elton turned in a 40-page synopsis. </p> <p>Lloyd Webber has taken some stick for \"stealing\" the story of the Belfast-based Star of the Sea team, for whom the hunger striker Bobby Sands played as a boy. The accusation is academic since there is no copyright on a life story, but Lloyd Webber may be sensitive to it as he says he does not recall the precise programme that triggered his interest. </p> <p>\"I remember seeing a documentary about young children in northern Ireland,\" he says. \"Apparently there were several documentaries and I can't remember which one it was. I thought if you have something like a team, it's a bit like the pub in EastEnders - you've got a forum in which things can happen. It's not really about football at all. It struck me that there was just possibly the germ of an idea there. I have a hundred ideas like this all the time; this happened to be the first one I mentioned to Ben and he happened to pick up on it.\" </p> <p>The musical follows the lives of the teenage players and their girlfriends as they grow up during the Troubles. There is a murder, a riot and an on-stage kneecapping. Critically, much will hinge on whether the bleak storyline, Elton's jokes and Lloyd Webber's lush music cohere. The story of young love in a divided community echoes West Side Story, and such comparisons might not favour Lloyd Webber, but it is a serious attempt to write a musical of and for our times. \"We tried not to trivialise it and went for a tougher ending,\" he says. \"We were very keen not to go for a sentimental ending.\" </p> <p>Lloyd Webber once said that he didn't mind people hating his music, but he did dislike those who questioned his integrity. It's a fair point. The art is a legitimate target - can complex politics be got across in a few anthemic songs? - but the intention is not. He has been criticised for latching on to the trendy subject of football, but, as he says, that is only a starting point for the show. In any case, he is no latecomer to the game, having supported Leyton Orient since he was a boy (his mother used to drop him off at the ground while she taught piano to impoverished pupils in east London). </p> <p>Lloyd Webber has the look of a man who thinks he has a hit on his hands, but doesn't want to tempt fate by saying so. \"It's going the same way as Cats went. The box office took off last week. It's one of those shows that might have a lousy first night for some reason, and it might not fly, but it has had a couple of preview nights when it has flown.\" </p> <p>Lloyd Webber looks a great deal happier than he did in 1997 when troubles were coming, as ever, in battalions. Polygram had bought a majority stake in his company and was threatening to take full control, which would have meant him losing his lucrative copyrights. Sunset Boulevard had underperformed, hitting the Really Useful Group's profitability. Then, as the election loomed, he became a national laughing stock when he was reported (wrongly, he insists) as saying that he would leave the country if Labour won. Wags put much of the huge Labour majority down to his intervention. </p> <p>The real crisis was the potential loss of the copyrights. \"That would have taken control of the company away from me,\" he says. \"We had to stop that somehow and due to various twists of fate we were terribly lucky and pulled off the impossible.\" The company is now entirely his again, though he says he is hands off. </p> <p>\"We have very good people here and if they want to do something I let them get on and do it. For example, they're developing a musical with the Pet Shop Boys at the moment. This is written up in the press as Lloyd Webber produces Pet Shop Boys, but of course it isn't. What we're thinking of doing, to allow the young people here some space, is having a wholly owned subsidiary with a different name, so that Really Useful doesn't produce anything other than mine. There are a couple of plays they've optioned, and that appears in the press as me doing it. But plays are not my forte.\" </p> <p>Lloyd Webber is both composer and businessman: he writes musicals for a West End that is now largely owned by his company. The Really Useful Group's travails in the mid-90s made him realise that the days of the blockbuster were over. The Beautiful Game is accordingly less extravagant than some of its predecessors, a return to the relative simplicity of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He thinks Sunset Boulevard, a perfectly good show in his view, was sunk by its extravagance. \"There were places where it could never make money. It shouldn't have been done. You can't have a show that will only work if it's playing at 90% capacity.\" His rule of thumb now is that investors should recoup their money in under a year with a show running at 85% capacity. </p> <p>Sorting out the politics has been almost as difficult as regaining control of the business. He denies that he threatened to leave the country if Labour were elected. What he actually said was that a high-tax regime would cause technicians to leave, and that in turn would make it hard for him to work here. He was ennobled by John Major and still takes the Conservative whip in the Lords, but he says he is a most reluctant Tory. </p> <p>\"I knew John Major and liked him a lot, but I'm not sure what I'm going to do in the future. I think that, despite the glitch that is happening at the moment, this government has done pretty well. I'm not a particular fan of the opposition. I voted with the government on section 28 because I felt very strongly that that was wrong; so I don't know that I am necessarily a natural conservative. I'm lucky in one sense that I'm not in the House of Lords as a working peer. I'm an honorary peer and I took the Tory whip because I knew that John Major must have had a huge hand in it. In my heart of hearts I know that I'm a cross-bencher.\" </p> <p>He enjoys making occasional interventions in public affairs. He wrote to the Telegraph last week to suggest that the Dome be burned in a conflagration that would attract paying spectators (his old collaborator Tim Rice called him to say the letter was the best thing he had written since Evita). He also wrote a column for three years for the Telegraph - he gave it up to write The Beautiful Game - and says he misses it. </p> <p>Perhaps he is loathed because, like Melvyn Bragg, he won't stay in his artistic box. He is composer, entrepreneur and public figure: bright, opinionated and uncompromising. He is also, of course, extremely rich, with a personal fortune of \u00a3420m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He and his third wife, Madeleine, own a stud; they have racehorses; he has the world's finest collection of pre-Raphaelite paintings; he once shelled out \u00a318m for a Picasso. </p> <p>Artists are supposed to be broke; he manifestly isn't. Artists are collected; he collects, with the obsessiveness of the small boy who adored trains. He is a curious and interesting figure: steeped in serious music yet in love with musical theatre; rich enough not to fret about politics but fretting anyway; oddly delighted to have won an award at the Newbury show last weekend for his organic peas; and anxious enough to run out into the street in the rain to give me the name of a horse of his that he thinks will win at Ascot tomorrow. Crystal Music. That's the horse, not a comment on the show, just in case my Lloyd Webber-loathing friend was worrying.</p>",

That was before a dinner with Ben Elton that, in the best let's-do-the-show-right-here traditions, changed everything. \"I thought I was beginning to tread water a bit with Whistle Down the Wind,\" Lloyd Webber told me when we met at the Really Useful Group's really lovely office in Soho. \"So when Ben said he would be interested in writing with me it was a breath of fresh air. If musical theatre is to have a relevance, from time to time we have to take on subjects that are challenging, or we might as well be doing nothing but revivals. You can't go on looking back, and maybe I'm guilty of having looked back a little bit myself in one or two of my recent things. Now I feel refreshed.\" In late 1998, Lloyd Webber had approached Elton to provide some new material for Starlight Express. Elton said no to that but suggested, as the wine flowed, that they collaborate on a contemporary piece. Lloyd Webber recalled seeing a TV programme about a group of Irish youngsters who played in a non-sectarian football team and, a few weeks later, Elton turned in a 40-page synopsis. Lloyd Webber has taken some stick for \"stealing\" the story of the Belfast-based Star of the Sea team, for whom the hunger striker Bobby Sands played as a boy. The accusation is academic since there is no copyright on a life story, but Lloyd Webber may be sensitive to it as he says he does not recall the precise programme that triggered his interest. \"I remember seeing a documentary about young children in northern Ireland,\" he says. \"Apparently there were several documentaries and I can't remember which one it was. I thought if you have something like a team, it's a bit like the pub in EastEnders - you've got a forum in which things can happen. It's not really about football at all. It struck me that there was just possibly the germ of an idea there. I have a hundred ideas like this all the time; this happened to be the first one I mentioned to Ben and he happened to pick up on it.\" The musical follows the lives of the teenage players and their girlfriends as they grow up during the Troubles. There is a murder, a riot and an on-stage kneecapping. Critically, much will hinge on whether the bleak storyline, Elton's jokes and Lloyd Webber's lush music cohere. The story of young love in a divided community echoes West Side Story, and such comparisons might not favour Lloyd Webber, but it is a serious attempt to write a musical of and for our times. \"We tried not to trivialise it and went for a tougher ending,\" he says. \"We were very keen not to go for a sentimental ending.\" Lloyd Webber once said that he didn't mind people hating his music, but he did dislike those who questioned his integrity. It's a fair point. The art is a legitimate target - can complex politics be got across in a few anthemic songs? - but the intention is not. He has been criticised for latching on to the trendy subject of football, but, as he says, that is only a starting point for the show. In any case, he is no latecomer to the game, having supported Leyton Orient since he was a boy (his mother used to drop him off at the ground while she taught piano to impoverished pupils in east London). Lloyd Webber has the look of a man who thinks he has a hit on his hands, but doesn't want to tempt fate by saying so. \"It's going the same way as Cats went. The box office took off last week. It's one of those shows that might have a lousy first night for some reason, and it might not fly, but it has had a couple of preview nights when it has flown.\" Lloyd Webber looks a great deal happier than he did in 1997 when troubles were coming, as ever, in battalions. Polygram had bought a majority stake in his company and was threatening to take full control, which would have meant him losing his lucrative copyrights. Sunset Boulevard had underperformed, hitting the Really Useful Group's profitability. Then, as the election loomed, he became a national laughing stock when he was reported (wrongly, he insists) as saying that he would leave the country if Labour won. Wags put much of the huge Labour majority down to his intervention. The real crisis was the potential loss of the copyrights. \"That would have taken control of the company away from me,\" he says. \"We had to stop that somehow and due to various twists of fate we were terribly lucky and pulled off the impossible.\" The company is now entirely his again, though he says he is hands off. \"We have very good people here and if they want to do something I let them get on and do it. For example, they're developing a musical with the Pet Shop Boys at the moment. This is written up in the press as Lloyd Webber produces Pet Shop Boys, but of course it isn't. What we're thinking of doing, to allow the young people here some space, is having a wholly owned subsidiary with a different name, so that Really Useful doesn't produce anything other than mine. There are a couple of plays they've optioned, and that appears in the press as me doing it. But plays are not my forte.\" Lloyd Webber is both composer and businessman: he writes musicals for a West End that is now largely owned by his company. The Really Useful Group's travails in the mid-90s made him realise that the days of the blockbuster were over. The Beautiful Game is accordingly less extravagant than some of its predecessors, a return to the relative simplicity of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He thinks Sunset Boulevard, a perfectly good show in his view, was sunk by its extravagance. \"There were places where it could never make money. It shouldn't have been done. You can't have a show that will only work if it's playing at 90% capacity.\" His rule of thumb now is that investors should recoup their money in under a year with a show running at 85% capacity. Sorting out the politics has been almost as difficult as regaining control of the business. He denies that he threatened to leave the country if Labour were elected. What he actually said was that a high-tax regime would cause technicians to leave, and that in turn would make it hard for him to work here. He was ennobled by John Major and still takes the Conservative whip in the Lords, but he says he is a most reluctant Tory. \"I knew John Major and liked him a lot, but I'm not sure what I'm going to do in the future. I think that, despite the glitch that is happening at the moment, this government has done pretty well. I'm not a particular fan of the opposition. I voted with the government on section 28 because I felt very strongly that that was wrong; so I don't know that I am necessarily a natural conservative. I'm lucky in one sense that I'm not in the House of Lords as a working peer. I'm an honorary peer and I took the Tory whip because I knew that John Major must have had a huge hand in it. In my heart of hearts I know that I'm a cross-bencher.\" He enjoys making occasional interventions in public affairs. He wrote to the Telegraph last week to suggest that the Dome be burned in a conflagration that would attract paying spectators (his old collaborator Tim Rice called him to say the letter was the best thing he had written since Evita). He also wrote a column for three years for the Telegraph - he gave it up to write The Beautiful Game - and says he misses it. Perhaps he is loathed because, like Melvyn Bragg, he won't stay in his artistic box. He is composer, entrepreneur and public figure: bright, opinionated and uncompromising. He is also, of course, extremely rich, with a personal fortune of \u00a3420m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He and his third wife, Madeleine, own a stud; they have racehorses; he has the world's finest collection of pre-Raphaelite paintings; he once shelled out \u00a318m for a Picasso. Artists are supposed to be broke; he manifestly isn't. Artists are collected; he collects, with the obsessiveness of the small boy who adored trains. He is a curious and interesting figure: steeped in serious music yet in love with musical theatre; rich enough not to fret about politics but fretting anyway; oddly delighted to have won an award at the Newbury show last weekend for his organic peas; and anxious enough to run out into the street in the rain to give me the name of a horse of his that he thinks will win at Ascot tomorrow. Crystal Music. That's the horse, not a comment on the show, just in case my Lloyd Webber-loathing friend was worrying.",

      "bodyText": "At least one Nato country is expected to dispatch troops to Sierra Leone to bolster the crumbling United Nations peacekeeping force following India's decision yesterday to withdraw its 3,000 soldiers and abandon command of the operation, according to western diplomatic sources. The Indian pullout comes amid bitter infighting with the Nigerian contingent, and follows accusations of weak leadership and fears that the mission could collapse because of poor quality troops and equipment. The UN security council has already agreed to increase the size of the largest peacekeeping operation in the world to 20,500 troops. With the withdrawal of the Indians, about 10,000 new soldiers now have to be found to serve in Sierra Leone. The sources said that a sizeable number is likely to be drawn from one or more eastern European members of Nato and from Latin America, but that agreements with the governments concerned have to be finalised. Britain has ruled out joining the UN force in Sierra Leone although it has more than 200 soldiers there to train the new army and to provide security. The decision to bring in European and Latin American troops is a marked shift away from the UN security council's - and consequently the British and American - policy of encouraging regional peacekeeping forces in Africa. It comes amid accusations that western nations are not prepared to risk the lives of white soldiers in Africa, and much hand wringing by world leaders at the millennium summit earlier this month over the dire state of peacekeeping on the continent. Although the Indians say their withdrawal is routine and expected, it follows a stinging attack by the force's Indian commander, General Vijay Jetley, on the sizeable Nigerian contingent in Sierra Leone. In a confidential report first made public in the Guardian, Gen Jetley accused Nigerian political and military officials at the top of the UN mission of \"sabotaging peace\" in favour of national interests, and alleged that Nigerian army commanders illegally mined diamonds in league with Revolutionary United Front rebels. After the report was published, the Nigerian army called for Gen Jetley's immediate resignation and said it could no longer work with him. But the general's comments reflected considerable concern within the UN mission about the conduct and intent of the Nigerian army which has plundered Liberia and Sierra Leone during earlier military interventions. The Indian withdrawal could be a blow to the British strategy in Sierra Leone of pushing the UN into confronting the RUF through a peace enforcement role while trying to keep the Nigerians from taking control. But it might also prove an opportunity if it can be used to persuade other European armies to join the peacekeeping force and provide the quality of troops and equipment now lacking. The Jordanian contingent - whose troops were strongly criticised for fraternising with the West Side Boys who abducted 11 British soldiers last month - has added to the pressure for western involvement by saying that it too may pull out unless at least one Nato country sends troops. Britain's minister for Africa, Peter Hain, who ruled out direct UK participation in the peacekeeping mission yesterday, said that the UN force would not be allowed to collapse. \"All options are being explored with member countries, including Nato countries, but Britain is very overstretched in Kosovo, with Iraq and in Northern Ireland,\" he said. \"There will be a fully fledged UN peacekeeping operation in Sierra Leone. It will be a better force with an improved command structure.\" The Sierra Leone army has occupied the village of Magbeni, one of two West Side Boys bases stormed by British troops earlier this month. The Sierra Leone military said its troops \"encountered no resistance\".",

A confidential report from the union's accountants, HW Fisher, which was discussed by the union's finance and general purposes committee yesterday, calls for the union to impose \u00a33m savings and introduce a virtual freeze on most activities until the end of this year. One senior MSF officer told the Guardian: \"We are facing a financial catastrophe\". The accountants' report offers a series of unpalatable options to prevent the union going permanently into the red. These include selling either the union's Dublin headquarters, housed in the former American embassy, or its residential training institution, Whitehall College at Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire, and imposing big cuts on staff by reducing the headcount from the present 375 to a maximum of 300. Proposals discussed include scrapping an autumn campaign on health and safety issues in the workplace; wholesale cancellation of union publications until the end of the year; reducing union training courses at the college, including new ones on equal opportunities for women and ethnic minorities; banning officials from travelling to meet one another on union business; and cancelling meetings of sector committees to discuss industry issues. The cuts arrive as Roger Lyons, the union's general secretary, has come under fire for alleged lavish expense claims, and for losing and then having to settle a series of employment tribunal cases, which have cost members \u00a3900,000. Allegations were made by one \"whistleblower\", Marcia Solomon, who won a \u00a350,000 settlement for unfair dismissal, that Mr Lyons and Nelson Mendes, head of the finance department, fiddled thousands of pounds in expenses. Mr Mendes is on sick leave, and according to a national executive report is not likely to work for the union again. The union has instructed lawyers to fight an unfair dismissal case being brought by Bryan Keegan, former chauffeur to the general secretary, which is due to be heard in January. Lawyers are also being asked to take action to close down a website run by MSF member David Beaumont, which details Mr Lyons' alleged expense claims, lists articles in the press on the lifestyle of the general secretary, and reports on tribunal cases. The union is having to pay back \u00a3600,000 a year to the banks to cut its overdraft and needs to put aside \u00a3750,000 fully to fund its pension scheme. Earlier this year the union's pension trustees in their report indicated \"dismay and anger\" over Mr Lyons' failing to consult them on a \u00a3200,000 payout to three senior union staff who took early retirement. Minutes of MSF's finance committee and national executive for the last four months - obtained by the Guardian - revealed a steadily deteriorating financial situation as the union lost a series of tribunal cases. Last year the union was running a \u00a3182,000 surplus each month. By last April the surplus had dwindled to \u00a34,000 a month, falling to \u00a32,200 a month in May. The national executive was told in June by HW Fisher that to remain viable \"on an income of \u00a326m, the union should be generating a 'basic' surplus of \u00a31m per annum as a minimum level for an efficient organisation.\" The report added the union could not continue to pay \u00a3600,000 off its overdraft by selling property, and that pension contributions would have to increase from 6% to 19% to protect the scheme. The July finance committee was told that savings of \u00a32m were urgently required - but the committee told the accountants these savings were now not enough and ordered them back for a rethink. Other changes being implemented include new expenses forms, which for the first time require NEC members and the general secretary to obtain counter-signatures.

Mr Bush wants time to assess all the options on missile defence if he is elected president in November, and he may not ask Congress for funding for new programmes until the January 2002 budget, his chief foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, told a press briefing. Mr Bush does not intend to be any more precise about his defence thinking and military spending plans during the remaining phases of the election campaign, she added. \"He is an excellent decision maker, but you don't have time on the campaign trail, nor really the resources on the campaign trail, to make a decision of this magnitude.\" So far Mr Bush's speeches have implied that he is committed to expanding the national missile defence (NMD) system being developed by Mr Clinton's administration. This limited programme, involving about 100 interceptor missiles stationed in Alaska is supported by the Democratic presidential candidate, Al Gore. Mr Clinton announced on September 1 that he was leaving the decisions whether and how to go ahead with NMD to his successor. Ms Rice's comments do not change the likelihood that Mr Bush will go for a bigger and more ambitious programme if he is elected, but they suggest that his team accepts that it will have to spend some months negotiating on the issue next year. America's allies and foes remain opposed to Mr Clinton's plan, which would breach the 1972 Anti Ballistic Missile treaty between the US and Russia and would involve building radar ground stations in Britain and Greenland. But they are even more apprehensive about Mr Bush's plans, because he would almost certainly like to install interceptors far more widely. Mr Bush wants to examine other additional systems, Ms Rice said. These may include as yet untested weapons in the early stage of development, such as lasers on aeroplanes and short- and medium-range interceptors on ships. One upgrade to the Clinton system most discussed in Republican circles would allow the US to shoot down missiles in the \"boost phase\", when they are travelling more slowly just after take-off and the debris - potentially including chemical and biological agents - would fall near where they were launched. Mr Bush will examine all these options from a technological and strategic point of view, Ms Rice said. She refused to say how many new weapons might be under consideration or what their cost might be. \"What the governor has said is that this is a very high priority within defence and that he will find the resources to do it, but we do not have a number.\" If Mr Bush wins he will conduct a \"top-down\" review of all military structures and strategies, Ms Rice said.

      "bodyText": "Indonesian police have arrested some soldiers in connection with the murders of three workers for the UN refugee agency in West Timor earlier this month, and the preceding killing of a militia leader that sparked the attack on the UN staff. The move suggests Jakarta is at last responding to threats of international isolation if it fails to rein in the militias holding sway in West Timor. Their incursions disrupt and terrorise newly independent East Timor and keep more than 120,000 East Timorese in squalid refugee camps along the border between the two parts of Timor. Some aid agencies also say food for the refugees is running low, though the government denies this. Western diplomats believe that the arrests - announced yesterday by Indonesia's attorney general, Marzuki Darusman - bear out their repeated assertion that not only are elements of the military helping the militias but that the armed forces are fractured, with some key generals not obeying President Abdurrahman Wahid. The three workers for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) were killed on September 6 in the border town of Atambua, where hundreds of militiamen attacked their office. They were hacked to death and their bodies set on fire. With the security authorities standing by, the mob then ran amok in the town. Yesterday Mr Darusman said six people were being picked up. \"The identification of the suspects has been made and they are in the process of being summoned and interrogated,\" he said. \"They include elements of the military.\" Seven others have been arrested in connection with the death on September 5 of a militia leader, Olivio Maruk. These also include members of the armed forces. Mr Darusman said he did not know how many of the suspects were soldiers or what their ranks were. He said they were rogue elements and that the military as an institution was not party to the murders. The chief military spokesman, Rear Air Marshal Graito Usodo, said people should not jump to conclusions about the arrests of soldiers. Militia leaders said the rampage and the killing of the UN workers was sparked by the murder and castration the previous day of Mr Maruk. Analysts believe he may have been killed because he had been named as a suspect in the investigation into the destruction wreaked in East Timor last year when the territory voted for independence, and might have implicated senior soldiers when questioned. The UN has said it will not send staff back to West Timor to help the refugees until the militias have been disarmed and disbanded. Indonesia's senior security minister, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, promised the UN security council at the weekend that the militias would be given until Monday to hand in their weapons; then the military would seize them. Marshal Usodo said yesterday that negotiations had begun with gang leaders to hand over weapons but said the process would not be easy as the militias were insisting on compensation for their guns, most of which they obtained from the Indonesian army. The US and the World Bank have both said in the last week that if the militias are not disarmed and disbanded rapidly then Jakarta could find itself isolated and its aid cut off. Conditions for the refugees are deteriorating. Red Cross officials in West Timor said food supplies were critically low. Indonesia's vice-president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, is to visit the refugees this weekend with 100 tonnes of rice. \u0095 Around 1,500 aid workers marched in Geneva on Thursday to demand better protection in dangerous parts of the world. \"We are aid workers, not martyrs,\" Naveed Hussain, head of the staff council at the UNHCR told the rally.

There is water coming into our villages. The paddy fields are completely submerged. Now even snakes are entering our houses and several homes have collapsed,\" one villager told India's Star TV. The latest floods come less than a month after unusually heavy monsoon rains brought destruction to south and north-east India, and to Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh. More than 400 people have died so far. Some 10m people have been marooned by the latest rains, with road and rail links severely disrupted. Telecom workers protest ing against imminent privatisation had already paralysed phone lines in West Bengal. Last night the state's deputy chief minister, Buddhadev Bhattacharya, asked them to go back to work, saying their action made the relief effort more difficult. The Indian Red Cross yesterday began distributing rice, pans, cooking oil, tarpaulins and mosquito nets. The International Red Cross has launched a $3.5m appeal, warning that with crops destroyed many villagers face severe debt. \"People are taking shelter wherever they can find it, in areas of high ground and in school buildings,\" N L Sharma, the Indian Red Cross's deputy director, said.",

The Calder, which used to be dyed orange by corduroy makers in Hebden Bridge and purple by Halifax carpet mills, now supports a thriving fishery; the Aire has seen 40 miles rescued for the two lowest grades of water quality since 1990. \"It has been a victory for sustained environmental pressure,\" said Kevin Grady of the pressure group Eye on the Aire. \"When it became clear that Leeds businesses were determined to pour millions of pounds into riverside development, they weren't going to stand for a river of froth and smells.\" Sir John Harman, chair of the Environment Agency, emphasised the point from his own experience as a boy.

They were wireless operators who risked their lives communicating with London. They were sabotage experts who planned attacks on infrastructure and munitions factories in German-occupied France. They were lonely men in a hostile land who could make no friends, nor take any lovers lest they also courted betrayal. And they were only 21. </p> <p>If they were caught, these men were tortured, the smallest details of which were wince-inducing. They had their fingers shut in doors, were beaten with coshes, were half (or more precisely, three-quarters) drowned. Yet they did not betray their colleagues, even when they were sent to concentration camps. Guido Zembsch-Schreve, a Dutchman who spoke five languages, had an incredible number of lucky escapes before he was finally captured. \"Long long time, I have kept the marks of the whips on my back\", he said solemnly, before bursting into a song he used to sing when he travelled round France pretending to be someone he wasn't. He revealed the particulars of his torture with almost jovial recollection. Are today's 21-year-olds so stoic? Is anyone of any age so stoic? \"I'm still a Dutchman and Dutchmen have very hard skulls.

The First Aid Nursing Yeomanry staffed the stations which translated the code that wireless operators tapped out of France. These women, like Barbara O'Connell, had sharp pencils and sharper minds, doing their bit for the war effort. Sometimes we even put love at the end of a message, O'Connell confessed, even though they didn't know the agents and every extra minute transmitting could signal capture by the Germans and their triangulations. But if you can't send love, what's the point, eh? </p> <p>Secret Agent was as dramatic and engrossing as its subjects were heroic and humorous. One described how a case he was transporting kept moving to the side of the train he was on by its own accord. It held magnetic limpet mines.

He had already built a classroom, helped two villagers set up their own building firm and subsequently wanted the good people of Hutton to take aid, medicine and music out to Dabaso. The resulting trip by half of Hutton's population (including its publican) to Kenya could well form the basis of a new Britflick. Mark the burly builder (perhaps played by The Full Monty's Mark Addy) was accompanied by Terry Potter, parish councillor and head of the Hutton Horticultural Society (Warren Clarke); Dr Peter, the town's GP (Robson Green); Bernard the grouchy vicar (Iain Glen); and Eric the choir master with - it looked like - his wife (Richard Briers and Janine Duvitski), who had composed a special song, Jambo Dabaso, complete with a climatic Kumba yah. A bit of love interest thrown in somewhere and a complex father-son relationship and - boom - a sure-fire hit.

He reportedly told the producer, Arnaud Hamelin, that he wanted to \"tell the truth\".</p> <p>Mr Chirac did not comment on the charges, but Ms Colonna said Mr M\u00e9ry's accusations contradicted testimony he had made to investigating magistrates both before and after he recorded the videotape.</p> <p>\"In a democracy, justice must prevail over slander,\" she said. She added that the videotape should be handed over to a state prosecutor who would investigate why it had not been handed over to magistrates.</p> <p>The justice minister, Elisabeth Guigou, said it would be up to the judiciary to decide what to do with the tape.</p> <p>In its editorial, Le Monde acknowledged that in publishing what it called \"an exceptional document\" it was taking a risk. \"But since this is a matter in which the very functioning of democracy in France is at stake, we feel it is our duty to take that risk,\" it said.</p> <p>The accusations are the most direct so far against Mr Chirac, who was mayor of the French capital from 1977 until his election to the Elys\u00e9e in 1995. His name has also been linked with an employment scandal in which hundreds of RPR activists were allegedly paid by the town hall to perform non-existent jobs.</p> <p>Some 50 businessmen and politicians, including the current mayor of Paris, Jean Tiberi, and a former RPR prime minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9, have been placed under formal investigation - one step short of being charged - in the long-running probe into RPR funding.</p> <p>Despite the mounting evidence that he was at least aware of the wrongdoing, Mr Chirac is unlikely to be prosecuted in the very near future: France's highest court ruled last year that French presidents are immune from prosecution except for high treason.</p>",

Mr M\u00e9ry said the RPR, which Mr Chirac founded, was financed through rake-offs from public works contracts in the Paris region when the president was mayor. \"We worked only on orders from Mr Chirac,\" he said during the hour-long tape, describing how he handed over some \u00a3500,000 to an RPR official in the presence of Mr Chirac in 1986. The transcript also quotes Mr M\u00e9ry as saying that the cash payments to the RPR reached a total of \"\u00a33.5m to \u00a34m every year for more than seven years, under my direction\". He reportedly told the producer, Arnaud Hamelin, that he wanted to \"tell the truth\". Mr Chirac did not comment on the charges, but Ms Colonna said Mr M\u00e9ry's accusations contradicted testimony he had made to investigating magistrates both before and after he recorded the videotape. \"In a democracy, justice must prevail over slander,\" she said. She added that the videotape should be handed over to a state prosecutor who would investigate why it had not been handed over to magistrates. The justice minister, Elisabeth Guigou, said it would be up to the judiciary to decide what to do with the tape. In its editorial, Le Monde acknowledged that in publishing what it called \"an exceptional document\" it was taking a risk. \"But since this is a matter in which the very functioning of democracy in France is at stake, we feel it is our duty to take that risk,\" it said. The accusations are the most direct so far against Mr Chirac, who was mayor of the French capital from 1977 until his election to the Elys\u00e9e in 1995. His name has also been linked with an employment scandal in which hundreds of RPR activists were allegedly paid by the town hall to perform non-existent jobs. Some 50 businessmen and politicians, including the current mayor of Paris, Jean Tiberi, and a former RPR prime minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9, have been placed under formal investigation - one step short of being charged - in the long-running probe into RPR funding. Despite the mounting evidence that he was at least aware of the wrongdoing, Mr Chirac is unlikely to be prosecuted in the very near future: France's highest court ruled last year that French presidents are immune from prosecution except for high treason.",

This was blatantly not true as several of the trains that left for Burma's second city, 375 miles to the north of Rangoon, were far from full.

Security at the station was extremely heavy with truckloads of riot police and scores of plainclothes officers swarming all over the area. A few dozen NLD supporters who turned up in advance to demonstrate were whisked away while journalists and British diplomats were refused entry.

      "body": "<p>The first petrol-buying panic was bad enough. The second one on Tuesday, this time sparked by rumours of blockades rather than blockades themselves, was lunacy taken to extreme.</p> <p>Along with all the other rips in the fabric of our custom and practice that the fuel crisis produced, Britain's image is in shreds. A culture that prides itself on common sense, moderation and the ability to keep cool in a crisis finds itself racing to the pumps like Gadarene swine at the slightest hint of trouble. People who normally run on half-tanks join the hoarders and fill their cars to the brim.</p> <p>Faced with similar crises the French and Germans proved to be more reasonable than cool Britannia. When refinery blockades hit southern France and parts of the north-east two weeks ago, local petrol stations ran out but those in Paris operated as normal and there was no panic buying. Yet, by any measure other than its effect on releasing a mass psychosis, the French protests were worse than Britain's.</p> <p>The hauliers mounted real blockades, with lorries drawn up across the entrances of refineries and fuel depots, making it physically impossible for tankers to move. Contrast this with Britain's deckchair-men sitting politely on the verges. While the British government declared a phoney \"red alert\" in the national health service to try to turn the public against the protesters, the crisis in France's health system was genuinely grave. Ambulance-drivers had joined the barricades.</p> <p>One reason for France's ability to maintain its sang-froid may be that the authorities are better armed. Acting on advice from central government, the prefect of every d\u00e9partement can requisition petrol stations and order them to serve only public services such as hospitals, school buses, the police and fire brigade. The prefect can also instruct petrol stations to impose rations on private buyers. In Britain, where restraint has to be self-imposed, only a few garage managers had the common sense to do this. Most succumbed to the general selfishness and happily sold to the first comers rather than accepting the extra time and effort involved in rationing.</p> <p>In Germany the picture has also not been flattering for the British. There the fuel-tax protests targeted some refineries but mainly chose to cause chaos in town centres with crawling convoys of lorries and taxis making access impossible. As in France, the effect was localised. While Bremen, Hamburg and Magdeburg came to a standstill, other cities, including Berlin, kept calm. People did not react by panic buying.</p> <p>Beside the new phenomenon of the easily excitable British, the fuel crisis turned other things on their head. Rightwing horror of direct action evaporated while centre-left sneering about Mondeo man was shown up as crude elitism. Old industrial paradigms became hollow, and the voices at the Trades Union Congress that called the crisis a \"bosses' blockade\" sounded absurd. Many protesters were owner-drivers who only possess one lorry. Some are union members. People who denounced the hauliers as rightwing thugs of the kind who smashed through picket lines during the miners' strike should realise that some of today's lorry drivers are ex-miners.</p> <p>British hauliers are luckier than their continental counterparts. They are protected, at least to some extent, by geography. In France and Germany the fuel tax protests are only partly directed against the government. Owner-drivers and small firms are equally angry with the big haulage companies, some of which own up to 4,000 lorries and use underpaid Bulgarian and Polish drivers to trundle up and down the autobahns. In response to this unfair competition, the owner-drivers are forced to cut corners on maintenance or abandon their spare tires so as to carry more freight.

      "bodyText": "The first petrol-buying panic was bad enough. The second one on Tuesday, this time sparked by rumours of blockades rather than blockades themselves, was lunacy taken to extreme. Along with all the other rips in the fabric of our custom and practice that the fuel crisis produced, Britain's image is in shreds. A culture that prides itself on common sense, moderation and the ability to keep cool in a crisis finds itself racing to the pumps like Gadarene swine at the slightest hint of trouble. People who normally run on half-tanks join the hoarders and fill their cars to the brim. Faced with similar crises the French and Germans proved to be more reasonable than cool Britannia. When refinery blockades hit southern France and parts of the north-east two weeks ago, local petrol stations ran out but those in Paris operated as normal and there was no panic buying. Yet, by any measure other than its effect on releasing a mass psychosis, the French protests were worse than Britain's. The hauliers mounted real blockades, with lorries drawn up across the entrances of refineries and fuel depots, making it physically impossible for tankers to move. Contrast this with Britain's deckchair-men sitting politely on the verges. While the British government declared a phoney \"red alert\" in the national health service to try to turn the public against the protesters, the crisis in France's health system was genuinely grave. Ambulance-drivers had joined the barricades. One reason for France's ability to maintain its sang-froid may be that the authorities are better armed. Acting on advice from central government, the prefect of every d\u00e9partement can requisition petrol stations and order them to serve only public services such as hospitals, school buses, the police and fire brigade. The prefect can also instruct petrol stations to impose rations on private buyers. In Britain, where restraint has to be self-imposed, only a few garage managers had the common sense to do this. Most succumbed to the general selfishness and happily sold to the first comers rather than accepting the extra time and effort involved in rationing. In Germany the picture has also not been flattering for the British. There the fuel-tax protests targeted some refineries but mainly chose to cause chaos in town centres with crawling convoys of lorries and taxis making access impossible. As in France, the effect was localised. While Bremen, Hamburg and Magdeburg came to a standstill, other cities, including Berlin, kept calm. People did not react by panic buying. Beside the new phenomenon of the easily excitable British, the fuel crisis turned other things on their head. Rightwing horror of direct action evaporated while centre-left sneering about Mondeo man was shown up as crude elitism. Old industrial paradigms became hollow, and the voices at the Trades Union Congress that called the crisis a \"bosses' blockade\" sounded absurd. Many protesters were owner-drivers who only possess one lorry. Some are union members. People who denounced the hauliers as rightwing thugs of the kind who smashed through picket lines during the miners' strike should realise that some of today's lorry drivers are ex-miners. British hauliers are luckier than their continental counterparts. They are protected, at least to some extent, by geography. In France and Germany the fuel tax protests are only partly directed against the government. Owner-drivers and small firms are equally angry with the big haulage companies, some of which own up to 4,000 lorries and use underpaid Bulgarian and Polish drivers to trundle up and down the autobahns. In response to this unfair competition, the owner-drivers are forced to cut corners on maintenance or abandon their spare tires so as to carry more freight. No wonder that even the French Communist party, not normally known for flexibility, does not buy the line about a \"bosses' blockade\". It is demanding more concessions on fuel tax than its socialist partners in the French government have yet given. In part this is political opportunism, though it does show awareness that the old categories no longer fit. Opposition parties across Europe are seizing on the tax revolt to revive their fortunes.

      "byline": "Karl French",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When I am called upon to write about the mostly fictional entity called Spinal Tap, I usually do so in the mostly fictional character of David St Hubbins, long-time guitarist/clothes-horse for said group. David can knock the piece off at one sitting, email it to his manager, and be back in bed by 10am. But the one thing David St Hubbins can't do for us is talk about a movie called This Is Spinal Tap. None of the band can give you a rundown on the odd genesis of this film, because it doesn't exist in their world. So I'm filling in. </p> <p>In 1978, Rob Reiner, fresh from a long distinguished stretch in series television, put together a special called The TV Show. It spooved (yes, that is the correct word) network and local television, satirising a full viewing day's worth of crap in one hour. It was very funny. </p> <p>I knew Rob, and several of the writers were old friends of mine. One of the proposed pieces was a parody of a show called Midnight Special, a rock'n'roll concert/variety show, hosted by the late Wolfman Jack. Christopher Guest, who would go on to play the Tap's Nigel Tufnel, suggested that a pea-brained English rock band be featured in the sketch. Chris and I had played a couple of road-weary Britrockers in a short piece he had directed so I became involved in the project. Chris, Rob, the show's producer Harry Shearer (who would play Tap bassist Derek Smalls) and I wrote the song Rock'n'Roll Nightmare and its accompanying visual foolishness. After some groping about for a suitably duff name, we settled on Spinal Tap. </p> <p>About a year and a half later, Rob was looking to direct feature films, and the notion of doing a fake documentary about this awful band snowballed. Rob pitched the idea and got a hearty \"maybe\" from Sir Lew Grade's US wing, Marble Arch. In early 1980, the four of us began meeting daily to furnish Spinal Tap with a believable past. We watched a lot of rock'n'roll concert and documentary film, and noted the recurrence of an interesting theme: the survivor - the yeoman road warrior who never says die, no matter how clearly the market suggests he do so. </p> <p>We had no intention of writing a screenplay. The idea was to construct the history of the band and the characters, set the general story elements and improvise the dialogue, having hired actors we knew could play the game. We shot a demo in four days and Rob assembled the piece over the next few months. In the interim, Marble Arch had released Legend of the Lone Ranger and Raise the Titanic (right boat, wrong direction!) in rapid succession and slipped quietly out of the Big Tent. </p> <p>We assumed it was not going to happen. We all went back to our day gigs and night sweats until Lindsay Doran, a fan of Rob's and a bright light at Embassy Pictures, suggested they just make the damn thing anyway. Jerry Parenchio and Norman Lear, dean of Reiner's alma mater, All in the Family, were running Embassy, and things fell gradually into place. We began writing, casting and crewing in the spring of 1982. </p> <p>Peter Smokler's camera rolled late in that year. We had cast old buds like Paul Benedict, Billy Crystal, Ed Begley and Paul Shaffer, along with new friends Fran Drescher, Dana Carvey, Patrick Macnee, Anjelica Huston, et al. Ric Parnell and David Kaff came aboard as drummer Mick Shrimpton and keyboardist Viv Savage. June Chadwick was cast as Jeanine, St Hubbins's ladylove. Tony Hendra became our manager, the faithless Ian Faith. We asked everyone to come and improvise with us. We'd made very few miscalculations: the actors got the joke and flew with it, and every day's shooting was at least as much fun as the day before. Rob edited the film over the next year, and the film was released in March of 1984. </p> <p>The critics liked us very much. The public that found us, either by fluke or in response to the \"trickledown\" theory of promotion, found us funny. But we were a modestly budgeted satirical film with a very specific voice; we gave the bigger spring releases no serious nightmares. It did play in one theatre in Boston for something like a year, and the fans we encountered were smart and funny and flattering. This Is Spinal Tap made a lot of Best of the Year lists; it just didn't crack 1984's top 10 box office. But it was the movie we had wanted to make, and we were very happy with it. </p> <p>Video release widened our circle of friends; bits of Tapspeak found their way into the language. We had achieved an important goal: shelf-life, the ability to stay fresh and crisp while other comedy gets stale and mouldy. When someone reports watching the movie regularly and finding new stuff to laugh at each time, it makes us very glad. Lots of other stuff has happened since. Rob, Harry, Chris and I have been thankfully busy most of the time - but for each of us the making of this strange movie was a high point. </p> <p> <strong> Michael McKean </strong> </p> <p><strong> Authenticity </strong></p> <p> The band wrote and performed all the music from the film, with collaboration from Rob Reiner. Harry Shearer has spoken of the irony that many real bands rely on miming to pre-recorded tracks for their live performances, while \"the joke band really plays\". Christopher Guest concludes: \"What we've seen over the years, when we've played live, is that people want to feel as if they're part of the movie. Because they were the audience watching this movie, the audience that comes to the show feel as if they are now in the movie in a funny way, and they become the audience in the movie and it's very difficult to separate. It's a very bizarre phenomenon. They know all the songs and we can never tell... are they joking? Or do they know?... At what point does this become real or imagined?\" </p> <p><strong> Backstage requirements</strong><br> </p> <p> In This Is Spinal Tap, Nigel Tufnel is seen being appeased by the band's manager, Ian Faith, as he runs through what is wrong with the backstage catering. The particular inspirations were the peculiar demands made by Jerry Lewis, Yul Brynner and especially Van Halen - who, according to legend, insist on being served bowls of M&amp;Ms with the brown ones taken out. Michael McKean recalls Brynner's contract for backstage provisions demanding: \"Under no circumstances must white eggs be substituted for brown.\" </p> <p>Guest recalls of Spinal Tap's real tours: \"We also suffered many of the ignominies that the band did in the film. Art imitating life that had already imitated art. At one gig there was half a sandwich and a pitcher of water in the dressing room. That was it. At least the sandwich was wrapped in plastic\" </p> <p><strong> Bizarre gardening accident</strong><br> </p> <p> The manner of original Tap drummer John \"Stumpy\" Pepys's death in 1969. The idea of the \"bizarre gardening accident\" has entered the language and the popular imagination. Angry Salad, a Boston-based rock band, have released an album by that name and it is rumoured that Jeff Porcaro, the drummer of Toto, may in fact have died in this way in 1992, eight years after the release of This Is Spinal Tap. One theory has it that Porcaro was spraying insecticide in his garden and inhaled too much, triggering a fatal heart attack. Ironically, Toto's lead guitarist, Steve Lukather, served as producer and guitarist on Spinal Tap's Break Like the Wind in the same year. </p> <p><strong> Cher</strong><br> </p> <p> Cher was one of the celebrity collaborators on the Tap's comeback project, Break Like the Wind. She sang with St Hubbins on Just Begin Again. The collaboration was hampered by Cher's apparent animosity towards her co-singer - as St Hubbins recalled in a 1992 interview in The Nose: \"It was great in one sense that she insisted on me not being anywhere near her when she sings. In fact, the papers said I had to be 100 yards away from Cher when she's actually doing vocals, which would be a house-and-a-half down the road from the studio where we were doing it.\" When asked why Cher didn't join the band in person for their comeback tour, St Hubbins explained: \"We begged, we pleaded, and finally she agreed not to.\" </p> <p><strong> Don't Look Back</strong><br> </p> <p> DA Pennebaker's seminal rockumentary of Bob Dylan's UK tour of 1965. One of the declared inspirations for This Is Spinal Tap, the film offers a searingly candid view of the young, supremely confident Dylan on tour. We see him granting an audience to his nervous acolyte Donovan who sings To Sing For You in a nearly embarrassing homage to his idol. Dylan is shown suffering from the everyday niggles of touring, such as singing The Times They Are A-Changin' with an initially dysfunctional mike - it isn't plugged in. The most obvious reference in This Is Spinal Tap is the getting-lost-backstage scene. After the Manchester gig, Dylan and his entourage are seen scurrying around backstage desperately trying to find their way out, and Dylan enquires urgently: \"Where's the door?\" </p> <p> See also: Xanadu Star Theatre </p> <p><strong> Eleven</strong><br> </p> <p> In one of the great sequences of modern film comedy, Nigel, having shown Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner) his beloved guitar collection, introduces him to his Marshall amp: \"This is a top to what we use on stage, but it's very, very special because, if you can see, the numbers all go to 11.

Huston emerged from the shadows after Spinal Tap, starring in Prizzi's Honor (1985), The Dead (1987), Crimes and Misdemeanours (1989), The Grifters (1990) and The Addams Family (1991). </p> <p><strong> Iron Butterfly</strong><br> </p> <p> One of the first heavy rock bands, Iron Butterfly were formed in San Diego in 1966. It is fitting that there should be strong links between the Tap and Iron Butterfly, for whom the description \"heavy metal\" is believed to have been coined. The band plotted a similar course to the Tap, moving from psychedelia to heavy rock and pushing the envelope of the four-minute pop song to the epic form with their classic In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (the album of the same name is said to have sold 25m copies). Spinal Tap played their first live gig at Gazzari's on Sunset Strip, in a double bill with Iron Butterfly. </p> <p><strong> Judas Priest</strong><br> </p> <p> One of the bands to which the Tap have consistently been likened.

In the interviews, the band explain that they got together having been assured that they would get \"more pussy than Frank Sinatra\". </p> <p>Among the film's Tap-like moments: the band members discuss the pleasures and pains of 16 years on the road, and the tensions and joys created by mixing music and women; a very obviously and chronically goofed keyboardist, Richard Manuel, recalls the band's problems with settling on a name: \"It was right in the middle of the whole psychedelia, Chocolate Strawberries and Marshmallow Overcoat - those kind of names. They were the Hawks and toyed with becoming the Crackers or the Honkies before eventually settling on the Band.\" In a very Tap-like observation, Robbie Robertson acknowledges what rock'n'roll had done for them: \"It took us everywhere. It took us to some strange places... physically, spiritually and psychotically.\" </p> <p><strong> McKean, Michael</strong><br> </p> <p> Actor playing David St Hubbins. Besides his moment of glory as St Hubbins, McKean has made a name for himself, like Shearer, as a voice artist, and in supporting corporate/nerdy roles, often faintly sinister. </p> <p><strong> Nash, Graham (1942-)</strong><br> </p> <p> Rock star, born in Manchester, who was a founder member of the Hollies before forming Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young in 1967. He appears in The Return of Spinal Tap as the man who goes into Jeanine's shop, The Drippery, complaining of trouble with his chakra ball. </p> <p><strong> The Otto Show</strong><br> </p> <p> The episode of The Simpsons, for which Shearer is a regular voice artist, in which Bart goes to his first heavy metal concert when Spinal Tap play Springfield. Marge is heard saying optimistically: \"I hope the Spinal Tap don't play too loud.\" We see that Bart is wearing a T-shirt bearing the words: \"Spinal Tap World Tour: London Paris Munich Springfield.\" </p> <p><strong> Pettibone, Jeanine</strong><br> </p> <p> The presence of David St Hubbins's girl friend Jeanine in This Is Spinal Tap supplies what McKean, Guest and Shearer call \"The Yoko plot\". She represents the threat posed to the central duo by the appearance of a woman. Nigel and David are the core of the band, with obvious reference to Jagger/Richard, Lennon/McCartney and Page/Plant. Women are meant to be entertainment on tour and steady girlfriends or wives are anathema to the whole experience. </p> <p>In Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Do, John Lydon writes of his experiences in the Sex Pistols with his mate Sid Vicious and Sid's girlfriend, Nancy Spungen. After the break-up of the band, Rotten wanted to work again with Sid, who assured him he had given up drugs: \"I told him to meet me at Gunter Grove so we could talk - provided he didn't bring Nancy, which he did. Nancy was getting at Sid and wanted to be his manager. The ego games were so appalling, it resembled something out of that rock'n'roll satire movie, Spinal Tap.\" </p> <p><strong> Pischedda, Tommy</strong><br> </p> <p> Chauffeur played by Bruno Kirby. The special resentment between chauffeurs and rock stars reached its crisis point in 1976 when The Who's Keith Moon accidentally ran over and killed his own chauffeur, Cornelius Boland. </p> <p><strong> Plastercaster</strong><br> </p> <p> Legendary rock chick Nancy Godfrey was famed for her collection of plastercasts of rock stars' dicks. Apparently Jimi Hendrix is the star exhibit. In a sequence featured in the original script for This Is Spinal Tap, Derek and Viv are seen in their Memphis hotel room with their bums immersed in plaster as a favour to two groupies who collect casts of rock stars' bottoms. The groupies strip the plaster off Derek and Viv - but too soon. The casts are shapeless messes. </p> <p><strong> Q </strong><br> </p> <p> There is no Q. </p> <p><strong> Rock and Roll Creation</strong><br> </p> <p> This Tap track entered musical legend because of the trouble Derek Smalls had emerging from his pod during the performance of the song, as captured on This Is Spinal Tap. The original idea for the band to be born on stage out of pods was borrowed from 70s heavy-rock band Angel. </p> <p>For U2's Popmart tour, the show's designer Willie Williams and the band decided the group should emerge from a giant lemon. Asked what inspired the idea, Williams replied: \"Spinal Tap, actually. We needed a pod-like object for the band to come out of like they did in the movie. We felt that the more smoke there was the better, because it was the pure Spinal Tap moment. Just then Las Vegas decided to have the stillest wind ever. So The Edge comes down from the stairs, and to start his guitar he has to kick a switch on his foot-pedal. Well, he ended up on his hands and knees, feeling around for the pedal. Later he said to me, 'There I was at the debut, the premiere opening night, and this voice came into my head: I'm Derek Smalls.'\" </p> <p><strong> Stonehenge</strong><br> </p> <p> It has been widely claimed that Spinal Tap's Stonehenge set was taken from a notorious Black Sabbath live extravaganza, the 1984 Born Again tour. In BBC TV's Rock Family Trees, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Ian Gillan (the then vocalist) recalls the meeting with LSD, the designers: \"We were all going, 'Something earthy, maybe.' And Geezer said, 'Stonehenge.' The bloke says, 'That's a brilliant idea. How do you visualise it?' He said, 'Life-size of course.'\" </p> <p>The result was actually three times bigger than Stonehenge. Sabbath had to hire the Birmingham NEC for rehearsals as that was the only place it would fit - and that was without the stage. They assumed it would be all right in America, as \"all the places are bigger over there\". Then at the first gig they couldn't get it in the doors. </p> <p>In the December 1994 issue of Mojo magazine, Gillan adds: \"On the last day of rehearsal we're wondering what this dwarf is doing hanging around backstage. When we do the dress rehearsal, the dwarf emerges in a red leotard, long yellow fingernails and little yellow horns. He's going to be the baby [a diabolical baby is featured on the cover of the Born Again album]. Then we hear this horrendous [recorded] scream and suddenly we see this dwarf crawling across the top of Stonehenge. He stands up as the scream fades away and falls backwards off this 30ft fibreglass Stonehenge on to a pile of mattresses. Then - dong, dong - bells start tolling and all the roadies come across the front of the stage in monks' cowls, at which point War Pigs starts up.\" </p> <p>At first this may seem like a case of the film being inspired by real incidents, but this is improbable - the tour happened the same year This Is Spinal Tap was released. </p> <p><strong> Troggs tapes</strong><br> </p> <p> The British pop band, led by millionaire crop-circle enthusiast Reg Presley and famous for Wild Thing and Love Is All Around, became the subject of cult fame with the Troggs Tapes. These recordings, available on bootleg, were made during a session and display, according to The Penguin Encyclopaedia of Popular Music, \"instrumental incompetence, mutual recrimination and much foul language\". They inspired the sequence in which Tufnel and St Hubbins have their row in the Rainbow Trout Recording Studio. </p> <p><strong> Uriah Heep</strong><br> </p> <p> One of key bands who inspired the Tap, the long-lived and resolutely unfashionable Heep enjoyed commercial success, especially in America, for three decades, and plodded on despite critical indifference or scorn, enduring more than 30 changes in personnel (particularly with drummers) and two deaths. </p> <p>John Sinclair, the original keyboardist with Spinal Tap, had to leave the band when negotiations for the film were taking too long. He toured with Uriah Heep. When he returned to the project to contribute to the album, he told the band how Uriah Heep were once booked to play an air force base. Tap in turn play an air force base, where their sound system picks up military radio messages. </p> <p><strong> Vomit </strong><br> </p> <p> Eric \"Stumpy Joe\" Childs, the Tap's second drummer, died in 1974 by choking on vomit, although it has never emerged whose vomit it was. AC/DC's lead singer Bon Scott died this way, as did Jimi Hendrix and Mama Cass Elliot, of The Mamas and the Papas. But the immediate inspiration for Stumpy Joe's death is John Bonham, drummer of Led Zeppelin. On the afternoon of September 24 1980, Bonham started a drinking binge that continued until midnight. The following afternoon an assistant went to rouse him and found him dead. He had consumed around 40 shots of vodka, suffered alcohol poisoning and choked on his vomit in his sleep. </p> <p><strong> Wainwright III, Loudon</strong><br> </p> <p> In early incarnations of the Tap, singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III appeared as keyboard player. </p> <p><strong> Xanadu Star Theatre</strong><br> </p> <p> The venue in Cleveland, Ohio where the band get lost backstage. In his commentary for the Criterion laser disc edition, Christopher Guest recalls the inspiration for the scene: \"We saw a tape of Tom Petty playing somewhere in Germany, where he's walking backstage and a door's opened and he ends up on an indoor tennis court and there's just this moment of stunned, you know, 'Where am I?'\" </p> <p><strong> Yes</strong><br> </p> <p> Steven Soderbergh made a documentary of British prog-rock band Yes in the mid-80s called 9012 Live. In an interview with Soderbergh, Observer journalist Andrew Anthony asked incredulously if the film was made after This Is Spinal Tap. Soderbergh replied: \"Yeah. I took Jon Anderson to see it and he came back and told the rest of the guys about it. They started watching it, like, every day because it was so their world.\" </p> <p><strong> Zappa, Dweezil</strong><br> </p> <p> Son of rock guitarist Frank, who contributed a solo to Diva Fever on Break Like the Wind. </p> <p> \u0095 Extracted from This Is Spinal Tap, the Official Companion, edited by Karl French, published by Bloomsbury on 16 October at \u00a316.99.

      "bodyText": "When I am called upon to write about the mostly fictional entity called Spinal Tap, I usually do so in the mostly fictional character of David St Hubbins, long-time guitarist/clothes-horse for said group. David can knock the piece off at one sitting, email it to his manager, and be back in bed by 10am. But the one thing David St Hubbins can't do for us is talk about a movie called This Is Spinal Tap. None of the band can give you a rundown on the odd genesis of this film, because it doesn't exist in their world. So I'm filling in. In 1978, Rob Reiner, fresh from a long distinguished stretch in series television, put together a special called The TV Show. It spooved (yes, that is the correct word) network and local television, satirising a full viewing day's worth of crap in one hour. It was very funny. I knew Rob, and several of the writers were old friends of mine. One of the proposed pieces was a parody of a show called Midnight Special, a rock'n'roll concert/variety show, hosted by the late Wolfman Jack. Christopher Guest, who would go on to play the Tap's Nigel Tufnel, suggested that a pea-brained English rock band be featured in the sketch. Chris and I had played a couple of road-weary Britrockers in a short piece he had directed so I became involved in the project. Chris, Rob, the show's producer Harry Shearer (who would play Tap bassist Derek Smalls) and I wrote the song Rock'n'Roll Nightmare and its accompanying visual foolishness. After some groping about for a suitably duff name, we settled on Spinal Tap. About a year and a half later, Rob was looking to direct feature films, and the notion of doing a fake documentary about this awful band snowballed. Rob pitched the idea and got a hearty \"maybe\" from Sir Lew Grade's US wing, Marble Arch. In early 1980, the four of us began meeting daily to furnish Spinal Tap with a believable past. We watched a lot of rock'n'roll concert and documentary film, and noted the recurrence of an interesting theme: the survivor - the yeoman road warrior who never says die, no matter how clearly the market suggests he do so. We had no intention of writing a screenplay. The idea was to construct the history of the band and the characters, set the general story elements and improvise the dialogue, having hired actors we knew could play the game. We shot a demo in four days and Rob assembled the piece over the next few months. In the interim, Marble Arch had released Legend of the Lone Ranger and Raise the Titanic (right boat, wrong direction!) in rapid succession and slipped quietly out of the Big Tent. We assumed it was not going to happen. We all went back to our day gigs and night sweats until Lindsay Doran, a fan of Rob's and a bright light at Embassy Pictures, suggested they just make the damn thing anyway. Jerry Parenchio and Norman Lear, dean of Reiner's alma mater, All in the Family, were running Embassy, and things fell gradually into place. We began writing, casting and crewing in the spring of 1982. Peter Smokler's camera rolled late in that year. We had cast old buds like Paul Benedict, Billy Crystal, Ed Begley and Paul Shaffer, along with new friends Fran Drescher, Dana Carvey, Patrick Macnee, Anjelica Huston, et al. Ric Parnell and David Kaff came aboard as drummer Mick Shrimpton and keyboardist Viv Savage. June Chadwick was cast as Jeanine, St Hubbins's ladylove. Tony Hendra became our manager, the faithless Ian Faith. We asked everyone to come and improvise with us. We'd made very few miscalculations: the actors got the joke and flew with it, and every day's shooting was at least as much fun as the day before. Rob edited the film over the next year, and the film was released in March of 1984. The critics liked us very much. The public that found us, either by fluke or in response to the \"trickledown\" theory of promotion, found us funny. But we were a modestly budgeted satirical film with a very specific voice; we gave the bigger spring releases no serious nightmares. It did play in one theatre in Boston for something like a year, and the fans we encountered were smart and funny and flattering. This Is Spinal Tap made a lot of Best of the Year lists; it just didn't crack 1984's top 10 box office. But it was the movie we had wanted to make, and we were very happy with it. Video release widened our circle of friends; bits of Tapspeak found their way into the language. We had achieved an important goal: shelf-life, the ability to stay fresh and crisp while other comedy gets stale and mouldy. When someone reports watching the movie regularly and finding new stuff to laugh at each time, it makes us very glad. Lots of other stuff has happened since. Rob, Harry, Chris and I have been thankfully busy most of the time - but for each of us the making of this strange movie was a high point. Michael McKean Authenticity The band wrote and performed all the music from the film, with collaboration from Rob Reiner. Harry Shearer has spoken of the irony that many real bands rely on miming to pre-recorded tracks for their live performances, while \"the joke band really plays\". Christopher Guest concludes: \"What we've seen over the years, when we've played live, is that people want to feel as if they're part of the movie. Because they were the audience watching this movie, the audience that comes to the show feel as if they are now in the movie in a funny way, and they become the audience in the movie and it's very difficult to separate. It's a very bizarre phenomenon. They know all the songs and we can never tell... are they joking? Or do they know?... At what point does this become real or imagined?\" Backstage requirements In This Is Spinal Tap, Nigel Tufnel is seen being appeased by the band's manager, Ian Faith, as he runs through what is wrong with the backstage catering. The particular inspirations were the peculiar demands made by Jerry Lewis, Yul Brynner and especially Van Halen - who, according to legend, insist on being served bowls of M&amp;Ms with the brown ones taken out. Michael McKean recalls Brynner's contract for backstage provisions demanding: \"Under no circumstances must white eggs be substituted for brown.\" Guest recalls of Spinal Tap's real tours: \"We also suffered many of the ignominies that the band did in the film. Art imitating life that had already imitated art. At one gig there was half a sandwich and a pitcher of water in the dressing room. That was it. At least the sandwich was wrapped in plastic\" Bizarre gardening accident The manner of original Tap drummer John \"Stumpy\" Pepys's death in 1969. The idea of the \"bizarre gardening accident\" has entered the language and the popular imagination. Angry Salad, a Boston-based rock band, have released an album by that name and it is rumoured that Jeff Porcaro, the drummer of Toto, may in fact have died in this way in 1992, eight years after the release of This Is Spinal Tap. One theory has it that Porcaro was spraying insecticide in his garden and inhaled too much, triggering a fatal heart attack. Ironically, Toto's lead guitarist, Steve Lukather, served as producer and guitarist on Spinal Tap's Break Like the Wind in the same year. Cher Cher was one of the celebrity collaborators on the Tap's comeback project, Break Like the Wind. She sang with St Hubbins on Just Begin Again. The collaboration was hampered by Cher's apparent animosity towards her co-singer - as St Hubbins recalled in a 1992 interview in The Nose: \"It was great in one sense that she insisted on me not being anywhere near her when she sings. In fact, the papers said I had to be 100 yards away from Cher when she's actually doing vocals, which would be a house-and-a-half down the road from the studio where we were doing it.\" When asked why Cher didn't join the band in person for their comeback tour, St Hubbins explained: \"We begged, we pleaded, and finally she agreed not to.\" Don't Look Back DA Pennebaker's seminal rockumentary of Bob Dylan's UK tour of 1965. One of the declared inspirations for This Is Spinal Tap, the film offers a searingly candid view of the young, supremely confident Dylan on tour. We see him granting an audience to his nervous acolyte Donovan who sings To Sing For You in a nearly embarrassing homage to his idol. Dylan is shown suffering from the everyday niggles of touring, such as singing The Times They Are A-Changin' with an initially dysfunctional mike - it isn't plugged in. The most obvious reference in This Is Spinal Tap is the getting-lost-backstage scene. After the Manchester gig, Dylan and his entourage are seen scurrying around backstage desperately trying to find their way out, and Dylan enquires urgently: \"Where's the door?\" See also: Xanadu Star Theatre Eleven In one of the great sequences of modern film comedy, Nigel, having shown Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner) his beloved guitar collection, introduces him to his Marshall amp: \"This is a top to what we use on stage, but it's very, very special because, if you can see, the numbers all go to 11. Look, right across the board: 11, 11, 11.\" Marty: \"And most amps go up to 10.\" Nigel: \"Exactly.\" Marty: \"Does that mean it's louder? Is it any louder?\" Nigel: \"Well, it's one louder, isn't it?\" This exchange has become so embedded in the mythology of rock that the number 11 now has a separate and instantly accessible meaning. Eddie Van Halen is reputed to be the first rock guitarist to have been inspired by Spinal Tap and request a customised amp with dials going up to 11. Christopher Guest speaks in his commentary for the special laser disc edition of the film of how he has worked with the hi-fi company since the time of the film's production: \"Marshall made a special plate for me that went up to 11. Subsequently they have done some ads with me, and now the new amp that they made for me actually goes up to infinity on the dial. They made a real amp that goes up to 20. That's the one that people can buy in the stores now for real. But mine goes up to infinity. This has been ripped off big time. Almost every amp company now sells knobs that go up to 11.\" Foghat British boogie-blues band formed in 1970 who became successful in the US in the mid-70s. McKean, Shearer and Guest insist that the events in the film are not based on specific bands or personalities, but acts continue to claim or protest that they are the models. As Michael McKean explained in an interview with the Guardian: \"We were accused by someone from Foghat of planting a bug in their bus because they swore that we had ripped off the idea of the girlfriend taking over and using astrology to plan the tour.\" Fufkin, Artie Promoter at Polymer Records, Tap's label. In the NME on September 8 1984, Harry Shearer spoke of how people in the record industry would identify with the spoof: \"A lot of people from record companies bug us now. They take you aside and say, 'Well, Harry, if I say it myself, I'm the Artie Fufkin of this burgh,' not realising it's sort of a damning indictment.\" Guest, Christopher Plays Nigel Tufnel. Son of Lord Peter Haden-Guest and Jean Hindes, aka Lady Jean Haden-Guest, former vice-president of CBS. In 1984, the year This Is Spinal Tap was released, Guest married the actress Jamie Lee Curtis at Rob Reiner's home. Reputedly, Lee Curtis was first attracted to Guest when she saw his picture in Rolling Stone magazine, and arranged a date with him through his agent. In 1996, after the death of his father, Guest was ennobled as the fifth Baron Haden-Guest of Saling. In the Register of Lords' Interests, Guest is declared offly as: \"Film director.\" He is the half-brother of journalist and bon vivant Anthony Haden-Guest, who is widely believed to be the model for Peter Fallow, the louche, hard-drinking English journalist in Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities. Huston, Angelica Plays the designer of the Stonehenge set, Polly Deutsch. Huston emerged from the shadows after Spinal Tap, starring in Prizzi's Honor (1985), The Dead (1987), Crimes and Misdemeanours (1989), The Grifters (1990) and The Addams Family (1991).

Kunkel has served as producer for Clannad and played with Emmylou Harris, BB King and Bob Seger. Last Waltz, The Directed by Martin Scorsese, one of the inspirations for Martin DiBergi, this proto-rockumentary records the last performance by The Band, which Robbie Robertson describes as \"the beginning of the end of the beginning\". The interview technique of This Is Spinal Tap is lifted straight from The Last Waltz, where Scorsese placed himself in front of the camera for some of his chats with the band, of which he was a declared fan. In the interviews, the band explain that they got together having been assured that they would get \"more pussy than Frank Sinatra\". Among the film's Tap-like moments: the band members discuss the pleasures and pains of 16 years on the road, and the tensions and joys created by mixing music and women; a very obviously and chronically goofed keyboardist, Richard Manuel, recalls the band's problems with settling on a name: \"It was right in the middle of the whole psychedelia, Chocolate Strawberries and Marshmallow Overcoat - those kind of names.

Besides his moment of glory as St Hubbins, McKean has made a name for himself, like Shearer, as a voice artist, and in supporting corporate/nerdy roles, often faintly sinister. Nash, Graham (1942-) Rock star, born in Manchester, who was a founder member of the Hollies before forming Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young in 1967. He appears in The Return of Spinal Tap as the man who goes into Jeanine's shop, The Drippery, complaining of trouble with his chakra ball. The Otto Show The episode of The Simpsons, for which Shearer is a regular voice artist, in which Bart goes to his first heavy metal concert when Spinal Tap play Springfield. Marge is heard saying optimistically: \"I hope the Spinal Tap don't play too loud.\" We see that Bart is wearing a T-shirt bearing the words: \"Spinal Tap World Tour: London Paris Munich Springfield.\" Pettibone, Jeanine The presence of David St Hubbins's girl friend Jeanine in This Is Spinal Tap supplies what McKean, Guest and Shearer call \"The Yoko plot\". She represents the threat posed to the central duo by the appearance of a woman. Nigel and David are the core of the band, with obvious reference to Jagger/Richard, Lennon/McCartney and Page/Plant. Women are meant to be entertainment on tour and steady girlfriends or wives are anathema to the whole experience. In Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Do, John Lydon writes of his experiences in the Sex Pistols with his mate Sid Vicious and Sid's girlfriend, Nancy Spungen. After the break-up of the band, Rotten wanted to work again with Sid, who assured him he had given up drugs: \"I told him to meet me at Gunter Grove so we could talk - provided he didn't bring Nancy, which he did. Nancy was getting at Sid and wanted to be his manager.

The special resentment between chauffeurs and rock stars reached its crisis point in 1976 when The Who's Keith Moon accidentally ran over and killed his own chauffeur, Cornelius Boland. Plastercaster Legendary rock chick Nancy Godfrey was famed for her collection of plastercasts of rock stars' dicks. Apparently Jimi Hendrix is the star exhibit. In a sequence featured in the original script for This Is Spinal Tap, Derek and Viv are seen in their Memphis hotel room with their bums immersed in plaster as a favour to two groupies who collect casts of rock stars' bottoms. The groupies strip the plaster off Derek and Viv - but too soon. The casts are shapeless messes. Q There is no Q. Rock and Roll Creation This Tap track entered musical legend because of the trouble Derek Smalls had emerging from his pod during the performance of the song, as captured on This Is Spinal Tap. The original idea for the band to be born on stage out of pods was borrowed from 70s heavy-rock band Angel. For U2's Popmart tour, the show's designer Willie Williams and the band decided the group should emerge from a giant lemon. Asked what inspired the idea, Williams replied: \"Spinal Tap, actually. We needed a pod-like object for the band to come out of like they did in the movie. We felt that the more smoke there was the better, because it was the pure Spinal Tap moment. Just then Las Vegas decided to have the stillest wind ever. So The Edge comes down from the stairs, and to start his guitar he has to kick a switch on his foot-pedal. Well, he ended up on his hands and knees, feeling around for the pedal. Later he said to me, 'There I was at the debut, the premiere opening night, and this voice came into my head: I'm Derek Smalls.'\" Stonehenge It has been widely claimed that Spinal Tap's Stonehenge set was taken from a notorious Black Sabbath live extravaganza, the 1984 Born Again tour. In BBC TV's Rock Family Trees, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Ian Gillan (the then vocalist) recalls the meeting with LSD, the designers: \"We were all going, 'Something earthy, maybe.' And Geezer said, 'Stonehenge.' The bloke says, 'That's a brilliant idea. How do you visualise it?' He said, 'Life-size of course.'\" The result was actually three times bigger than Stonehenge. Sabbath had to hire the Birmingham NEC for rehearsals as that was the only place it would fit - and that was without the stage. They assumed it would be all right in America, as \"all the places are bigger over there\". Then at the first gig they couldn't get it in the doors. In the December 1994 issue of Mojo magazine, Gillan adds: \"On the last day of rehearsal we're wondering what this dwarf is doing hanging around backstage. When we do the dress rehearsal, the dwarf emerges in a red leotard, long yellow fingernails and little yellow horns. He's going to be the baby [a diabolical baby is featured on the cover of the Born Again album]. Then we hear this horrendous [recorded] scream and suddenly we see this dwarf crawling across the top of Stonehenge. He stands up as the scream fades away and falls backwards off this 30ft fibreglass Stonehenge on to a pile of mattresses. Then - dong, dong - bells start tolling and all the roadies come across the front of the stage in monks' cowls, at which point War Pigs starts up.\" At first this may seem like a case of the film being inspired by real incidents, but this is improbable - the tour happened the same year This Is Spinal Tap was released. Troggs tapes The British pop band, led by millionaire crop-circle enthusiast Reg Presley and famous for Wild Thing and Love Is All Around, became the subject of cult fame with the Troggs Tapes. These recordings, available on bootleg, were made during a session and display, according to The Penguin Encyclopaedia of Popular Music, \"instrumental incompetence, mutual recrimination and much foul language\". They inspired the sequence in which Tufnel and St Hubbins have their row in the Rainbow Trout Recording Studio. Uriah Heep One of key bands who inspired the Tap, the long-lived and resolutely unfashionable Heep enjoyed commercial success, especially in America, for three decades, and plodded on despite critical indifference or scorn, enduring more than 30 changes in personnel (particularly with drummers) and two deaths. John Sinclair, the original keyboardist with Spinal Tap, had to leave the band when negotiations for the film were taking too long. He toured with Uriah Heep. When he returned to the project to contribute to the album, he told the band how Uriah Heep were once booked to play an air force base. Tap in turn play an air force base, where their sound system picks up military radio messages. Vomit Eric \"Stumpy Joe\" Childs, the Tap's second drummer, died in 1974 by choking on vomit, although it has never emerged whose vomit it was. AC/DC's lead singer Bon Scott died this way, as did Jimi Hendrix and Mama Cass Elliot, of The Mamas and the Papas. But the immediate inspiration for Stumpy Joe's death is John Bonham, drummer of Led Zeppelin. On the afternoon of September 24 1980, Bonham started a drinking binge that continued until midnight. The following afternoon an assistant went to rouse him and found him dead. He had consumed around 40 shots of vodka, suffered alcohol poisoning and choked on his vomit in his sleep. Wainwright III, Loudon In early incarnations of the Tap, singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III appeared as keyboard player. Xanadu Star Theatre The venue in Cleveland, Ohio where the band get lost backstage. In his commentary for the Criterion laser disc edition, Christopher Guest recalls the inspiration for the scene: \"We saw a tape of Tom Petty playing somewhere in Germany, where he's walking backstage and a door's opened and he ends up on an indoor tennis court and there's just this moment of stunned, you know, 'Where am I?'\" Yes Steven Soderbergh made a documentary of British prog-rock band Yes in the mid-80s called 9012 Live. In an interview with Soderbergh, Observer journalist Andrew Anthony asked incredulously if the film was made after This Is Spinal Tap. Soderbergh replied: \"Yeah. I took Jon Anderson to see it and he came back and told the rest of the guys about it. They started watching it, like, every day because it was so their world.\" Zappa, Dweezil Son of rock guitarist Frank, who contributed a solo to Diva Fever on Break Like the Wind. \u0095 Extracted from This Is Spinal Tap, the Official Companion, edited by Karl French, published by Bloomsbury on 16 October at \u00a316.99.
