I am deeply sorry if he suffered any injury, and there was no malice on my part. I was focusing on the ball, he was holding on to my shirt and I was trying to get free ... He was behind me and at the time I did not know which part of him I hit.\" </p> <p>Brown, having seen a recording of the match - which he had not when he backed Hendry late on Wednesday - reiterated his support. </p> <p>The coach said yesterday: \"It was wrong, we know that, but it was not a heinous crime. He didn't take a knife out of his shorts, and didn't forearm-smash the player. I have got to stand up for my player and I think he has been vilified far too much. It's really over the top.\" </p> <p>There are no plans to drop Hendry, strip him of the captaincy or fine him. </p> <p>Because the Finnish referee Petter Kari did not see the incident, taking no action, it will presumably not appear in his match report. </p> <p>The incident will be taken further only if brought up by the Fifa observer, watching from the stand, or if San Marino have a change of heart and do lodge an official complaint with Fifa. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>How far does Nora collude in her own imprisonment in Ibsen's play? This interesting question is raised in Juliet Forster's thoughtful production for the Custard Factory theatre company. Forster has an approach to the play that sounds gimmicky but works very well. Ilona Macdonald and Kelvin Goodspeed play Nora and Torvald Helmer, the young couple whose relationship is built on play and fantasy, not reality or a genuine partnership. The rest of the cast are puppets. Nora's school friend, Kristen, is a doll that Nora finds in an old trunk; the money- lender is a looming shadow; most cleverly of all, the Helmers' friend Dr Rank is a comic little figure manipulated by Torvald. To him the couple say the things that they cannot say directly to each other. </p> <p>The interaction between live actors and puppets is so seamless that you pretty quickly cease to make the distinction between the two. And the puppetry has an interesting psychological effect, further isolating Nora and Torvald from the real world as they retreat from their problems into play-acting. </p> <p>The production made me realise just how infantile Nora and Torvald are, and how significant is the absence of their children. As the design makes clear, these are people who have not yet left the nursery and dressing-up box behind them. They hold each other back, both reluctant to take on the emotional maturity of the adult world. </p> <p>The insights of the production, which is particularly good on the couple's see-sawing balance of power, are not always matched by the performances, which lack both sharpness and, in the case of Macdonald's Nora, variation. The attempt to make the play relevant to modern audiences by taking it out of its Victorian context and having Nora wear short skirts is also a mistake. The play, and Nora's crisis, arise out of the fact that 100 years ago a woman could not borrow money without the loan being guaranteed by either her husband or her father. Times change, but the play's psychological acuity holds true. All us latter-day Noras in the audience may be able to pay off our debts with plastic but we sometimes need reminding when it is time to slam the doll's house door behind us. </p> <p> Until April 8.

They hold each other back, both reluctant to take on the emotional maturity of the adult world. The insights of the production, which is particularly good on the couple's see-sawing balance of power, are not always matched by the performances, which lack both sharpness and, in the case of Macdonald's Nora, variation. The attempt to make the play relevant to modern audiences by taking it out of its Victorian context and having Nora wear short skirts is also a mistake. The play, and Nora's crisis, arise out of the fact that 100 years ago a woman could not borrow money without the loan being guaranteed by either her husband or her father. Times change, but the play's psychological acuity holds true. All us latter-day Noras in the audience may be able to pay off our debts with plastic but we sometimes need reminding when it is time to slam the doll's house door behind us. Until April 8.

It has a wide range of powers including the ability to impose fines of up to \u00a350,000 on a company and up to \u00a35,000 on an individual; prohibit and disqualify pension scheme trustees, and appoint new trustees where necessary; referring cases to the police; and authorising criminal prosecutions.</p> <p>Mr Hayes says there have been \"relatively few\" cases - less than 50 - where it appears fraud has been committed, and most related to events before the Pensions Act came into force. He believes the general level of corporate governance and other standards of behaviour have improved in the last few years. </p> <p>But, interestingly, he takes the view that there are still a small minority of small and medium sized businesses where the employer believes, as Maxwell apparently did, that pension scheme cash \"is his money\". Eradicating this attitude is one of Opra's main tasks.</p> <p>Sitting alongside Opra is the Pensions Compensation Board, which was explicitly described at the time of its 1997 launch as a back-up insurance for pension funds \"in case there is another Maxwell\".</p> <p>It is funded by a levy paid by all occupational pension schemes, and to trigger a compensation payout the employer has to be insolvent and there has to have been a loss. However, it is not necessary for someone to have been convicted or even prosecuted - all it has to have is \"reasonable grounds for believing there has been loss attributable to an offence involving dishonesty\".</p> <p>In the four years it has been going the Board has only paid out on two claims, one of which involves a Birmingham company currently at the centre of a police investigation over the alleged disappearance of pension fund cash. The Board has made a payment of around \u00a360,000 in order to enable pensions to be paid for a period of six months, and expects to hand over more emergency cash to the scheme's trustees.</p> <p>Eariler this month further measures to tighten up pension scheme security were proposed by Paul Myners, the chairman of the Gartmore fund management group and chairman of the Guardian Media Group, in his Treasury-commissioned review of institutional investment. </p> <p>He recommended that pension scheme trustees should receive better training and better support from their sponsoring companies, and says that more of them should be paid for their services - something which should boost the numbers of people who put themselves forward to carry out this fairly onerous task. </p> <p>He also recommended that trustees become more expert in investment rather than leaving it all to consultants. The government accepted there should be a statutory basis for the skills required by trustees involved in investment decisions. In addition, Mr Myners called for a voluntary code of practice for trustees and investment managers.</p> <p>However, his government-backed recommendation that the so-called minimum funding requirement - a solvency test for pensions introduced to protect pensioners after the Maxwell debacle - be abolished in order to encourage pension funds to invest in a wider range of companies proved controversial. </p> <p>The scrapping of the MFR - which Mr Myners did not believe protected pension fund members - was met with concern in parts of the City about how pension fund schemes would be protected.</p>",

It is funded by a levy paid by all occupational pension schemes, and to trigger a compensation payout the employer has to be insolvent and there has to have been a loss. However, it is not necessary for someone to have been convicted or even prosecuted - all it has to have is \"reasonable grounds for believing there has been loss attributable to an offence involving dishonesty\". In the four years it has been going the Board has only paid out on two claims, one of which involves a Birmingham company currently at the centre of a police investigation over the alleged disappearance of pension fund cash. The Board has made a payment of around \u00a360,000 in order to enable pensions to be paid for a period of six months, and expects to hand over more emergency cash to the scheme's trustees. Eariler this month further measures to tighten up pension scheme security were proposed by Paul Myners, the chairman of the Gartmore fund management group and chairman of the Guardian Media Group, in his Treasury-commissioned review of institutional investment. He recommended that pension scheme trustees should receive better training and better support from their sponsoring companies, and says that more of them should be paid for their services - something which should boost the numbers of people who put themselves forward to carry out this fairly onerous task. He also recommended that trustees become more expert in investment rather than leaving it all to consultants. The government accepted there should be a statutory basis for the skills required by trustees involved in investment decisions. In addition, Mr Myners called for a voluntary code of practice for trustees and investment managers. However, his government-backed recommendation that the so-called minimum funding requirement - a solvency test for pensions introduced to protect pensioners after the Maxwell debacle - be abolished in order to encourage pension funds to invest in a wider range of companies proved controversial. The scrapping of the MFR - which Mr Myners did not believe protected pension fund members - was met with concern in parts of the City about how pension fund schemes would be protected.",

      "body": "<p>Europe's battered single currency yesterday plunged to its lowest level this year as traders expressed their disappointment at the European Central Bank's failure to deliver a hoped for cut in interest rates. </p> <p>Dealers had been expecting the ECB to join the world's other big central banks in reducing borrowing costs to prevent the onset of recession. But after the ECB's governing council announced its decision to keep rates unchanged at 4.75%, the euro fell to 88.20 cents, its lowest level since December 13 last year. </p> <p>\"Things may have been moving a little too fast for a number of council members, especially after the dramatic change in rhetoric last week,\" Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein economist Eckhard Schulte said. </p> <p>\"The ECB likes to have broad consensus in its monetary policy decisions. They clearly did not have it this time. But the bank does appear to be leaning towards a rate cut and I think we'll see one next time round.\" </p> <p>Analysts said that yesterday's inaction will increase pressure on the ECB for a steeper rate cut at its pre-Easter meeting on April 11. </p> <p>\"With US data likely to get worse in coming weeks, the pressure for a cut, perhaps even by 50 basis points, will mount,\" investment bank ING Barings said in a research note published yesterday. </p> <p>Many analysts have slashed their forecasts for European growth since the beginning of the year, as the fallout from the US slowdown has spread. The US government revised down its estimate of fourth quarter growth from a previously published 1.1% annual rate to 1%. </p> <p>Yesterday's decision \"will leave the ECB open to market criticism that it is in denial about the risks from the US and behind the curve in not cutting interest rates, leaving the euro vulnerable,\" according to ING Barings. </p> <p>The US Federal Reserve has cut rates three times since the beginning of the year in an attempt to halt the slide into recession. </p> <p>In recent days, there have been hints from the ECB that it is more concerned about slowing growth than about the fact that inflation in the eurozone is above its 2% ceiling.

      "bodyText": "Europe's battered single currency yesterday plunged to its lowest level this year as traders expressed their disappointment at the European Central Bank's failure to deliver a hoped for cut in interest rates. Dealers had been expecting the ECB to join the world's other big central banks in reducing borrowing costs to prevent the onset of recession. But after the ECB's governing council announced its decision to keep rates unchanged at 4.75%, the euro fell to 88.20 cents, its lowest level since December 13 last year. \"Things may have been moving a little too fast for a number of council members, especially after the dramatic change in rhetoric last week,\" Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein economist Eckhard Schulte said. \"The ECB likes to have broad consensus in its monetary policy decisions. They clearly did not have it this time. But the bank does appear to be leaning towards a rate cut and I think we'll see one next time round.\" Analysts said that yesterday's inaction will increase pressure on the ECB for a steeper rate cut at its pre-Easter meeting on April 11. \"With US data likely to get worse in coming weeks, the pressure for a cut, perhaps even by 50 basis points, will mount,\" investment bank ING Barings said in a research note published yesterday. Many analysts have slashed their forecasts for European growth since the beginning of the year, as the fallout from the US slowdown has spread. The US government revised down its estimate of fourth quarter growth from a previously published 1.1% annual rate to 1%. Yesterday's decision \"will leave the ECB open to market criticism that it is in denial about the risks from the US and behind the curve in not cutting interest rates, leaving the euro vulnerable,\" according to ING Barings. The US Federal Reserve has cut rates three times since the beginning of the year in an attempt to halt the slide into recession. In recent days, there have been hints from the ECB that it is more concerned about slowing growth than about the fact that inflation in the eurozone is above its 2% ceiling. That had been seen as a move to prepare the markets for a borrowing cut. Noting that the euro had fallen to its lowest level for three and half months, David Brown at Bear Stearns said: \"Had they actually cut rates today the euro would be trading stronger. It really beggars belief that they sat on their hands again. They had built up expectations so much and the market is going to have a very severe sense of being let down.\" Though the ECB statement gave few clues about its thinking, analysts believe that it is still concerned about the inflation risk and stronger than expected growth in the money supply.

However, in my inebriated state I had forgotten the answer and to this day cannot remember. If I can counter my friends claims that I am a useless alcoholic oaf by providing the answer, I will probably look dead clever. Can you help me?\"</strong> writes Matthew Szabo.</p> <p>You're very nearly right, Matto, although whether the following information will help you counter claims of being a useless alcoholic oaf is another matter. You did get all pissed up and forgot the point you were trying to make, after all.</p> <p>But if we can help you repair some of the damage, we will. Bristol City striker John Atyeo was the first player with a surname ending in 'o' to pull an England shirt on: he did so six times between 1956 and 1957. Chelsea's Ken Shellito was next, although he only got one cap in 1963.</p> <p>John Salako fared little better: he was capped five times during those glory, glory Graham Taylor years. But the most successful of the lot was Tony Dorigo, who collected a mammoth 15 caps between 1990 and 1994.</p> <p>Four players, none of whom achieved a great deal on the international stage. The moral? If you want to play for England, Matthew, we suggest lopping the end of your surname off. And cutting down on the booze, obviously.</p> <p><strong>WHERE DID THE TERM HAT-TRICK COME FROM?</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Which sport originated the term hat-trick?\"</strong> asks Harry Gottlieb.</p> <p>\"The term hat-trick originated within the sport of ice hockey, or just plain \"hockey\" as the Canuks know it,\" insists Neil MacKnish. \"A Toronto hat shop owner had the brainwave of publicising his business by offering a free hat to any member of his favourite team, the Toronto Maple Leafs, who scored three goals in a game. The media cottoned onto the offer, and the expression 'hat-trick' was born.\" </p> <p>But John Whiting is sure that the term comes from cricket. \"In the early days, those taking three successive wickets were awarded a complimentary hat,\" he says. \"Maybe two wickets was a brace and got you a pair of braces, but that's just speculation on my part.\"</p> <p><strong>WHY DON'T MORE TEAMS PLAY IN WEIRD COLOURS?</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Why don't more teams play in either black, green, maroon or purple? What is the history behind most teams playing in either blue, red or white?\"</strong> asks Paul Kilgour.</p> <p>\"I remember reading somewhere that in the 1800s the only colours widely available for kits were black, red, white and blue,\" says Lee Calvert. \"That is why England play in white and navy, because Scotland took navy shirts and Wales took red, and the ref already had black\"</p> <p>Meanwhile Phil Baiden says the reason why more clubs don't play in green is because it is considered unlucky. \"One famous example of this was at Peterborough in 1937,\" he says. \"The team's fans were complaining that the green shirts being worn were bringing the team bad luck. As a result the board declared, 'Pay for blue shirts and we'll wear blue shirts.' The rest is history.\"</p> <p>\"I assume that teams don't wear black because of the clash with referees, but Bristol Rovers began life as the Black Arabs wearing a dashing black shirt with a yellow sash,\" he adds. \"The blue and white quarters now worn were brought in by manager Albert Prince-Cox in the early thirties for no other reason than to make the team stand out.\"</p> <p>\"Also there are plenty of colour schemes that have vanished such as Brentford's pink, claret and sky and Watford's turquoise (again thought of as unlucky).\" </p> <p><strong>THE FIRST AUSSIE TO PLAY IN THE UK</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Who was the first Australian to play in the top flight in Britain?\"</strong> asks Robert Lawton.</p> <p>The man you're looking for is Joe Marston, who played 185 games for Preston North End between 1950 and 1956. Marston, who captained the Australian national side for much of the 1950s, was also the first Aussie to play at Wembley, turning out for Preston in their 3-2 FA Cup Final defeat against WBA in 1954.</p> <p>Recently Marston was acclaimed as the fourth most outstanding footballer of the century in the Oceania region - behind Wynton Rufer, Frank Farina and Christian Karembeu - and according to Bill Pennington is still going strong. \"Joe is still alive and living in Sydney, and his wife can still be found complaining about post-war rationing!\" he says.</p> <p>For more information see the book 'Aussies Abroad' which was published last year.</p> <p><strong>PHIL NEVILLE? PAH!</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Does anyone know who has the highest ratio of international caps to league appearances? Surely Phil 'overachiever' Neville is a prime candidate?\"</strong> asked Chris Field.</p> <p>Yeah, but he's joined by Northern Ireland's David Healy and Pat McGibbon, who while never playing a first team game for their club, Manchester United, still represented their country. Thanks to Iain Wright, Mickenna and Richard Evans for the spot.</p> <p><strong>TEAMS WITH ONE SEASON IN THE SUN</strong></p> <p>Last time out, we asked for teams who had one season in the sun amid years and years of darkness. You haven't let us down.</p> <p>\"A good non-British example of a stellar year surrounded by mediocrity was the 1970 Cagliari team, which won the Italian championship, thanks to the incomparable Gigi Riva, and never won anything else before or since,\" writes John Alvey.</p> <p>\"And what about the Ipswich team of 1962?\" he continues, with a nod to Alf Ramsey's championship-winning side. \"They won the Second Division championship the year before but, after Alf Ramsey left, dropped back into the Second by 1964 and did not get back to the First till 1968 and didn't win anything again till they won the Cup in 1978.\"</p> <p>\"I am tempted to say England post 1966 but that's probably not too accurate,\" he concludes. Ah but it is, John.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Neil McKenzie writes: \"Not quite the answer to the question, but what about Huddersfield Town in the mid-Twenties? A few years of superlative dominance, and bugger all else EVER!\"</p> <p>Fair point. Do you have anything to add, Ben Hendy?</p> <p>\"To add to your list of overacheiving clubs,\" he nods,\" I believe that the Southampton team of around 1984 somehow (God knows how) managed to finish second in the league to a certain Liverpudlian team. This was followed by a glorious dropping out of Europe in the second round.\" </p> <p>There must be more. Keep sending them in.</p> <p><strong>Can you help?</strong></p> <p>\"Who received the first red card in the Premiership/old 1st division?\" asks Andy Fouracre.</p> <p>\"When did shirt numbers first start getting used and who wore the first shirt with the number one on it?\" asks Mins.</p> <p>\"Does anyone know which non-league side has made the most appearances - including the preliminary stages - in European competition over the years?\" asks Mick Stead.</p> <p>\"Which foreign (non-British) player has scored the most goals in top-flight England?\" asks Simon Rogerson.</p> <p>Trawl through <a href=\"http://football.theguardian.com/news/theknowledge/0,9204,448018,00.html\">The Knowledge archive</a>.</p> <p>Your football questions are answered every Wednesday.

If I can counter my friends claims that I am a useless alcoholic oaf by providing the answer, I will probably look dead clever. Can you help me?\" writes Matthew Szabo. You're very nearly right, Matto, although whether the following information will help you counter claims of being a useless alcoholic oaf is another matter. You did get all pissed up and forgot the point you were trying to make, after all. But if we can help you repair some of the damage, we will. Bristol City striker John Atyeo was the first player with a surname ending in 'o' to pull an England shirt on: he did so six times between 1956 and 1957. Chelsea's Ken Shellito was next, although he only got one cap in 1963. John Salako fared little better: he was capped five times during those glory, glory Graham Taylor years. But the most successful of the lot was Tony Dorigo, who collected a mammoth 15 caps between 1990 and 1994. Four players, none of whom achieved a great deal on the international stage. The moral? If you want to play for England, Matthew, we suggest lopping the end of your surname off. And cutting down on the booze, obviously. WHERE DID THE TERM HAT-TRICK COME FROM? \"Which sport originated the term hat-trick?\" asks Harry Gottlieb. \"The term hat-trick originated within the sport of ice hockey, or just plain \"hockey\" as the Canuks know it,\" insists Neil MacKnish. \"A Toronto hat shop owner had the brainwave of publicising his business by offering a free hat to any member of his favourite team, the Toronto Maple Leafs, who scored three goals in a game. The media cottoned onto the offer, and the expression 'hat-trick' was born.\" But John Whiting is sure that the term comes from cricket. \"In the early days, those taking three successive wickets were awarded a complimentary hat,\" he says. \"Maybe two wickets was a brace and got you a pair of braces, but that's just speculation on my part.\" WHY DON'T MORE TEAMS PLAY IN WEIRD COLOURS? \"Why don't more teams play in either black, green, maroon or purple? What is the history behind most teams playing in either blue, red or white?\" asks Paul Kilgour. \"I remember reading somewhere that in the 1800s the only colours widely available for kits were black, red, white and blue,\" says Lee Calvert. \"That is why England play in white and navy, because Scotland took navy shirts and Wales took red, and the ref already had black\" Meanwhile Phil Baiden says the reason why more clubs don't play in green is because it is considered unlucky. \"One famous example of this was at Peterborough in 1937,\" he says. \"The team's fans were complaining that the green shirts being worn were bringing the team bad luck. As a result the board declared, 'Pay for blue shirts and we'll wear blue shirts.' The rest is history.\" \"I assume that teams don't wear black because of the clash with referees, but Bristol Rovers began life as the Black Arabs wearing a dashing black shirt with a yellow sash,\" he adds. \"The blue and white quarters now worn were brought in by manager Albert Prince-Cox in the early thirties for no other reason than to make the team stand out.\" \"Also there are plenty of colour schemes that have vanished such as Brentford's pink, claret and sky and Watford's turquoise (again thought of as unlucky).\" THE FIRST AUSSIE TO PLAY IN THE UK \"Who was the first Australian to play in the top flight in Britain?\" asks Robert Lawton. The man you're looking for is Joe Marston, who played 185 games for Preston North End between 1950 and 1956. Marston, who captained the Australian national side for much of the 1950s, was also the first Aussie to play at Wembley, turning out for Preston in their 3-2 FA Cup Final defeat against WBA in 1954. Recently Marston was acclaimed as the fourth most outstanding footballer of the century in the Oceania region - behind Wynton Rufer, Frank Farina and Christian Karembeu - and according to Bill Pennington is still going strong. \"Joe is still alive and living in Sydney, and his wife can still be found complaining about post-war rationing!\" he says. For more information see the book 'Aussies Abroad' which was published last year. PHIL NEVILLE? PAH! \"Does anyone know who has the highest ratio of international caps to league appearances? Surely Phil 'overachiever' Neville is a prime candidate?\" asked Chris Field. Yeah, but he's joined by Northern Ireland's David Healy and Pat McGibbon, who while never playing a first team game for their club, Manchester United, still represented their country. Thanks to Iain Wright, Mickenna and Richard Evans for the spot. TEAMS WITH ONE SEASON IN THE SUN Last time out, we asked for teams who had one season in the sun amid years and years of darkness. You haven't let us down. \"A good non-British example of a stellar year surrounded by mediocrity was the 1970 Cagliari team, which won the Italian championship, thanks to the incomparable Gigi Riva, and never won anything else before or since,\" writes John Alvey. \"And what about the Ipswich team of 1962?\" he continues, with a nod to Alf Ramsey's championship-winning side. \"They won the Second Division championship the year before but, after Alf Ramsey left, dropped back into the Second by 1964 and did not get back to the First till 1968 and didn't win anything again till they won the Cup in 1978.\" \"I am tempted to say England post 1966 but that's probably not too accurate,\" he concludes. Ah but it is, John. Meanwhile, Neil McKenzie writes: \"Not quite the answer to the question, but what about Huddersfield Town in the mid-Twenties? A few years of superlative dominance, and bugger all else EVER!\" Fair point. Do you have anything to add, Ben Hendy? \"To add to your list of overacheiving clubs,\" he nods,\" I believe that the Southampton team of around 1984 somehow (God knows how) managed to finish second in the league to a certain Liverpudlian team. This was followed by a glorious dropping out of Europe in the second round.\" There must be more. Keep sending them in. Can you help? \"Who received the first red card in the Premiership/old 1st division?\" asks Andy Fouracre. \"When did shirt numbers first start getting used and who wore the first shirt with the number one on it?\" asks Mins. \"Does anyone know which non-league side has made the most appearances - including the preliminary stages - in European competition over the years?\" asks Mick Stead. \"Which foreign (non-British) player has scored the most goals in top-flight England?\" asks Simon Rogerson.

      "body": "<p>Flying out of Zimbabwe, I almost left my rucksack behind in Harare. They had an unusual security system at the airport. When walking out to the plane you have to identify your luggage before it's put on board. Unfortunately I didn't realise this until I got into my seat and just happened to look out the window.</p> <p>There was my rucksack sitting forlornly by itself on the runway. I managed to fight my way to the front of the plane and salvage all my worldly possessions with seconds to spare before the steward closed the door.</p> <p>Arriving at Lilongwe, Malawi's capital, I spent a tedious hour queuing at immigration. Travelling in Africa takes 10 times as long as you expect. Planes never turn up. Trains get delayed by elephants crossing the tracks. And buses don't have a schedule - they just leave when they are full.</p> <p>I spent a night in Lilongwe and the next morning met up with H, my girlfriend, who had flown in from London. We travelled down to Cape Maclear on the southern shore of Lake Malawi. To get H in the holiday mood we had booked ourselves a two-day stay on a nearby island with a South African-based company called Kayak Africa.</p> <p>Cape Maclear lies off the main road at the end of a long and bumpy track. The effects of the recent heavy rain that has hit this part of Africa over the last month was clearly evident. Fields were flooded and large chunks of the road had been washed away.</p> <p>At Kayak Africa's base we were kitted out with a double kayak and introduced to our guide for the trip, Edward. Then it was straight into the water and we were paddling the eight kilometres to Mumbo Island. On the way Edward pointed out fish eagles swooping low over the water and local fisherman trailing their nets from carved wooden canoes.</p> <p>Mumbo Island was truly idyllic. The camp was perched on a rocky outcrop with a low wooden footbridge to the beach. Our tent looked out across the lake. When I say tent, this wasn't one of your tiny, canvas jobs that I had when I was a boy scout. This was a luxury, walk-in number, with two beds and a chest of drawers, covered by a thatched shelter and with its own veranda and hammock.</p> <p>There were five tents on the island, but as it is the low season we were the only ones there. This meant we had the undivided attention of the three guys who looked after the camp: Dennis, Adamson and the amazing cook, Francis. Francis had previously worked for pretty much every foreign embassy in Malawi so the food was excellent.</p> <p>We spent long, happy days snorkelling in the clear, blue waters and exploring the island with the kayak. We learnt how to play 'baur' (an addictive game using a carved wooden board and seeds for pieces and played a bit like solitaire for two). At night we sat out on the veranda and watched huge electrical storms lighting up the lake. </p> <p>It certainly wasn't cheap, but we were enjoying it so much that we decided to treat ourselves and booked to stay for an extra night.</p> <p>Unfortunately I can't show you just how wonderful it all was as Malawi's email facilities are very limited (I'm writing this on a borrowed computer and I'm not sure it's going to reach you), but I will try and send some photos soon.</p> <p>Back at Cape Maclear we spent a couple of days hanging round the beach.

      "bodyText": "Flying out of Zimbabwe, I almost left my rucksack behind in Harare. They had an unusual security system at the airport. When walking out to the plane you have to identify your luggage before it's put on board. Unfortunately I didn't realise this until I got into my seat and just happened to look out the window. There was my rucksack sitting forlornly by itself on the runway. I managed to fight my way to the front of the plane and salvage all my worldly possessions with seconds to spare before the steward closed the door. Arriving at Lilongwe, Malawi's capital, I spent a tedious hour queuing at immigration. Travelling in Africa takes 10 times as long as you expect. Planes never turn up. Trains get delayed by elephants crossing the tracks. And buses don't have a schedule - they just leave when they are full. I spent a night in Lilongwe and the next morning met up with H, my girlfriend, who had flown in from London. We travelled down to Cape Maclear on the southern shore of Lake Malawi. To get H in the holiday mood we had booked ourselves a two-day stay on a nearby island with a South African-based company called Kayak Africa. Cape Maclear lies off the main road at the end of a long and bumpy track. The effects of the recent heavy rain that has hit this part of Africa over the last month was clearly evident. Fields were flooded and large chunks of the road had been washed away. At Kayak Africa's base we were kitted out with a double kayak and introduced to our guide for the trip, Edward. Then it was straight into the water and we were paddling the eight kilometres to Mumbo Island. On the way Edward pointed out fish eagles swooping low over the water and local fisherman trailing their nets from carved wooden canoes. Mumbo Island was truly idyllic. The camp was perched on a rocky outcrop with a low wooden footbridge to the beach. Our tent looked out across the lake. When I say tent, this wasn't one of your tiny, canvas jobs that I had when I was a boy scout. This was a luxury, walk-in number, with two beds and a chest of drawers, covered by a thatched shelter and with its own veranda and hammock. There were five tents on the island, but as it is the low season we were the only ones there. This meant we had the undivided attention of the three guys who looked after the camp: Dennis, Adamson and the amazing cook, Francis. Francis had previously worked for pretty much every foreign embassy in Malawi so the food was excellent. We spent long, happy days snorkelling in the clear, blue waters and exploring the island with the kayak. We learnt how to play 'baur' (an addictive game using a carved wooden board and seeds for pieces and played a bit like solitaire for two). At night we sat out on the veranda and watched huge electrical storms lighting up the lake. It certainly wasn't cheap, but we were enjoying it so much that we decided to treat ourselves and booked to stay for an extra night. Unfortunately I can't show you just how wonderful it all was as Malawi's email facilities are very limited (I'm writing this on a borrowed computer and I'm not sure it's going to reach you), but I will try and send some photos soon. Back at Cape Maclear we spent a couple of days hanging round the beach. There were very few tourists but plenty of beach boys trying to sell you everything from trips to the islands to copious quantities of marijuana. Some of these guys have picked up mock cockney accents from somewhere. I had the following conversation with one of them: Beach boy: \"Aw'right mate, how ya doing?\" Me: \"Er, I'm good thanks. How are you?\" Beach boy: \"Blinding mate. What can I do ya for? Some ganja maybe?\" Me: \"No, no, I'm fine thanks\". Beach Boy: \"Ah, you're sorted then. Lovely jubbly.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 I travelled in Iran in 1999 with an Australian guy I \"met\" via the Lonely Planet website. I advertised for a male travel mate, 3 guys got in touch, one ended up not going, one was going a few days later than me (but has ended up becoming a good friend), and the other one fitted my needs re timing of the visit. We emailed each other for a few months before meeting up in a hotel room in Tehran at 5am! He was a great travelling companion and we are intending to travel together again this year. I would recommend using the site but I would make sure you advertise well in advance so you have the chance to get to know the person a bit before the actual trip. When I met up with Anthony in Tehran he was exactly as I had expected him to be - you don't really want any nasty surprises far from home. I wouldn't hesitate to do it again. Candi Bain \u0095 I returned from travelling in October 2000, having found that many people travel on their own and meet people as they go. You meet people going the same way all the time. It should not put you off if you are heading off alone because you'll meet people, no problems. A great way to meet people if you are heading down under' is 'Aus and NZ experience' tours available from Usit campus or STA. Dave Terrington \u0095 Manju, who wants to meet like-minded people to travel with, could try the Rough Guides site. It has a designated noticeboard for people looking for travel partners.

      "body": "<p>He was the only round-eye on board, but nobody noticed. Hugging his ankles like a peasant, he sat alone on the dented metal deck. He avoided faces, as always, watching the river from behind the funnel, quiet in the diesel stink where no one else would come.</p> <p> First the concrete dock slipped away, then the steep valley sides came close, squeezing the great river. It began to grumble, hurrying them more swiftly out of the mountains. Flat-footed as a Chinaman, he sat on the good canvas rucksack that always reminded him of years before, when he'd been the only round-eye in the Red Guards.</p> <p> The Guards had wanted to kill him, then disagreed. So they delayed their choice, marching away with the white man who walked like a peasant. On the second day they saw an old man in a field by the road. They poured down into the field and separated into three groups - the swordfish, the dragon and the swallow - competing for who could dig the deepest. Soon the old man was sinking to his knees as the leader slapped his face. They didn't finish their digging. Where they had worked, the soil was buried under gritty subsoil, the field ruined for a thousand years. </p> <p>Then he was sent to a Red Guard indoctrination camp. He met an old artilleryman who talked about his time firing ten shells a day across the Taiwan Straits. The Guards had chalked anti-capitalist slogans on the shells, but wrote them on the shell-cases so that the insults were spat at their feet. They had white-washed the murals in local temples and inoculated whole villages in an afternoon, their needles growing blunt on hundreds of arms and spreading Dog Tick Fever.</p> <p> His rucksack came from a dead peasant. The Guards had changed a shrine into a pigsty, and then discovered that this was a countryside without pigs. With joyful revolutionary songs they dragged a sow from the railhead. Six weeks later they returned to the village. There was a ham in the storehouse roof and pig bones hidden under straw, ready to be burned for fertiliser. That afternoon, resting on a hillside, he watched the executions across the valley. He knew that in the hills there were no scraps for pigs: pigs were a rich man's beast. But the peasants had only said \"Please, please,\" as they were led away. He saw the men falling in silence and then the sound like doors closing.</p> <p> Now he stood up, watching the other passengers from under his cap. He felt trapped again: sometimes there were police on the river boats. He went ashore at the next town and found it crowded with Westerners. They argued in front of tourist hotels, watched from cafes, loitered by racks of postcards - the first whites he had seen in thirty-five years. </p> <p> \"Not like the brochures,\" someone said in English. It was a grey-haired man, about his own age, talking to a large woman in a floral dress.</p> <p> \"The ancient marvels of an ageless civilisation,\" said the woman.</p> <p> \"And toilets to go with it.\" </p> <p> They drifted away as he watched from an alley. He was whispering to their retreating backs. \"My name is Jim,\" he murmured, as they vanished round a corner. \"Jim Fraser. Hello. Call me Jim. I have seen amazing things.\"</p> <p> <strong>Chapter 2</strong></p> <p> Fraser was eighteen when he came east. The troopship had docked first at Hong Kong, and he had trailed through the crowds with louder young men who somehow knew their way around. </p> <p> He pulled his cap low over one eye, though not so low as some of the others. Occasionally he spat. They took a rickshaw ride. Someone got tattooed.</p> <p> Then they were in a bar near the dockyard, and he was talking to a Chinese woman. Or rather, she talked to him. She wasn't pretty, but he was fascinated because she took care of everything. He didn't need to talk or be nice, he only had to keep his elbow in this puddle on the bar. The beers came, other girls came and went, but the woman kept her hand on his arm and said things which needed no reply.</p> <p> She took his hand and he felt a great jolt of desire. He looked around the bar, which was suddenly crowded and bright, but his friends from the regiment had left. \"Gone,\" said Fraser. \"All gone.\"</p> <p> He wasn't sure if this meant he was abandoned or free, but the woman led him outside, her strong bones gripping through the push of people. \"Very sorry,\" he said. \"Very drunk.\"</p> <p> Next they were in a ferry boat. He told the woman that he only felt ill because of the smell of the engine: he was never, never seasick. They travelled for a long time, then climbed a wooden ladder to the shore and passed up an alley in great darkness. </p> <p> Fraser started to complain, but wasn't displeased. \"I'm going home with a prostitute,\" he thought.</p> <p> Then he was sitting in a tiny room, an old woman watching him. This lasted for some time, but Fraser was glad because when the younger woman came back he had decided what was right. He gave her all his money, even the money in his sock, and said, \"Sleep. Sleep now.\"</p> <p> He woke in utter darkness, knowing what he would do. It was his first time. The woman grumbled and sighed as he entered her, but how effortlessly he was accommodated. China, he thought, China.</p> <p> When he woke next morning the woman had gone. He went into the tiny room next door and her mother or aunt or madam brought him tea. There seemed no pressure to leave, and anyway he wanted to ask for his money, or at least a part of it. The old woman bustled in and out while Fraser drank the whole sour pot of tea, but it was always impossible. At last, when she was gone for a moment, he hurried down a staircase as narrow as a ladder.</p> <p> When he got outside he needed to relieve himself. He looked along the tiny street for a bar, but recognized nothing. He stepped a few yards, searching for a quiet alley, but everywhere was crowded with Chinese. Washing spanned the streets, market stalls blocked the way. There was nothing familiar except an anonymous span of sky.</p> <p> He bundled his army jacket and hid it under his arm. He toiled up and around the tiny alleys while his urgent need came and went and came back stronger than ever. He brushed through crowds, for the first time in his life seeing no one taller than himself. Then he had a brainwave.</p> <p> He headed quickly downhill. He thought he passed the prostitute's house but wasn't sure and didn't stop. Soon he would find the port. The alley grew suddenly steeper, turned sharply right, and then Fraser halted. In front of him it reared steeply uphill again.</p> <p> He was standing on stones the size of suitcases. Between them was the glint of water. It was a tiny flat bridge over a tiny stream. He had been descending into a steep valley, and now the street invited him up the other side.</p> <p> He stepped off the bridge. There was a path running downstream, and he hurried past the backs of wooden houses that grew more squalid. An old man with no teeth quacked from the far bank. Pot-bellied children, naked but for a ragged shirt, paused in their scampering. And still there was nowhere to piss.</p> <p> Across the stream the houses gave way to a scrubby wood. He teetered across on wobbling stones, but found that the ground between the bushes was trodden solid. He imagined his piss running for yards across the bare earth, and pushed uphill into deeper undergrowth. At last, trembling and sweating, he drained his pee and his strength.</p> <p> He leaned back against a tree. After a minute he opened his eyes and blinked with surprise. Over the shoulder of a hill he could see the main Hong Kong harbour, crowded with ships. He'd come completely the wrong way.</p> <p> After a while he climbed further up the wooded slope. At the top he was disappointed again: he had thought Hong Kong was small. Inland, blue hills stepped into the distance, but there was nothing that looked like China.</p> <p>\"Hand grenades have these little squares on them,\" the sergeant had said. \"It's like they make bars of chocolate, so that every bugger gets a bit.\"</p> <p> Fraser saw the flash of his grenade that night in Korea. He forgot to duck and a pine tree lit up for a moment like a green army tent. Surely they would ignore him, the Chinese, if they overran the camp. All through the freezing night he was scared and incredulous: whatever he did the Communists would notice even him.</p> <p> But nobody was killed, just a Chinese, and they tramped through the snow to search the body. It was frozen solid, with bits of blood in its clothes like stained glass, but they raised it with enormous effort and left it sitting on a tree stump, one eye open and a hand cupped by its ear like someone deaf.</p> <p> They evacuated the camp, part of the general UN collapse, and fled south through the terrible Chinese ambush around Kunu-ri and on to a great Allied regrouping. The ice turned to mud, the rivers flooded and everyone thought they were going home.</p> <p> Instead a dozen of them climbed into Bren carriers and went back to the war, or 'back to front' as they all said. Two units, one American and one Turkish, had been left behind in the general rout. They were never found. At least, not before Fraser deserted.</p> <p> They were parked close to an empty village. The Chinese were coming, and the officer smoked hard as he studied their route back. Fraser was no longer the youngest, but still had to clean the sergeant's boots. He had to lend money, too, which somehow he could never ask for, and before every meal he was sent with a jerrycan to the nearest stream, because there were reports of wells being poisoned. </p> <p>Here it meant a long hike across a ploughed field. They had been issued with woollen cap-comforters against the bitter winds, but the sergeant insisted they wore them straight, which left their ears exposed: Fraser pulled his cap right down the moment he entered the woods where the Chinese had camped.</p> <p> There were cigarette packets, a latrine stink, and what looked like a Chinese army newspaper. Its flimsy pages were melting to paste, but Fraser had a favourite picture. An ant raced across the page as he gazed at the broad face of a peasant girl, leaning on a shovel and gazing into the sun. This is what they're fighting for, he thought.</p> <p> He remembered a story that one of the veterans had told him. It had happened to a friend who was driving a tank in North Africa. Their CO was a bastard. He gave every crew a tarpaulin and made them paint the outline of all the tools they carried. On inspections they laid out this tarpaulin with each tool in its outline, and they'd twice had their pay docked for losing things.</p> <p> Then the tank was on patrol and shed one of its tracks. This always took hours to fix, especially on sand, and when they got back they'd be nailed for not keeping it tensioned. They were packing up when they realized they'd lost a brass key the size of a thumb. They searched everywhere, blaming each other, but of course it was sunk somewhere under the sand. They couldn't waste any more time so they set fire to the tank and walked back. It was only four or five miles, and quite pleasant in the evening cool. They had time to sort out a story about running over some kind of mine or unexploded shell.</p> <p> Fraser tried to pick up the Chinese newspaper, but it fell to bits in his fingers. He threw the jerrycan into the bushes and walked into the woods, directly away from his unit.</p> <p>He spent two nights amongst ravenous fleas in the deserted village and two days lying flat in the middle of the ploughed field, watching the road. It was very cold, but he thought about the sergeant and the officer trying to explain his desertion. They'd have to admit ill-treating him. They'd be court-martialled.</p> <p> At last the Chinese came. He wouldn't surrender to front-line troops, waiting instead for cooks and wagon drivers. Then a jeep pulled up. The driver unloaded camp stools, and two officers climbed out and sat drinking tea, a map on the ground between them. </p> <p>Fraser stood up. He raised his hands and waited for a long minute until the officers grew still.</p> <p> For three days he sat only on the floor: in guard rooms, outside in the cold, and wedged between the benches on a troop train. Then he was ill. He remembered being picked up by two soldiers and soiling himself and them. For a time he lay in a hospital tent that was crowded but silent.</p> <p> He was getting better when they put him in an ambulance. He bounced over rough roads, guarded by a soldier in an antiseptic mask. Twice the ambulance stopped and his chamber pot was carried to the roadside. Fraser watched from the window as diesel was poured in and set alight.</p> <p> At a large prison they took his army clothes and dressed him in thin cotton. He shivered for a week while a sneering young man wrote down everything he said about Korea. After that there was a kind of progress. </p> <p>He rode a train for four days until it was warm like Hong Kong. In police vans or converted buses he followed a river upstream as the roads got worse and the air cooler. It was obvious when he reached the end of his journey.</p> <p><strong>Chapter 3</strong></p> <p> Very faint and dizzy he had stared without interest at yet another small town. Here, though, he had to get down from the truck. He tottered up steep alleys past dirty wooden houses. Every vista ended with a hill or the river. On the far bank, mountains crowded to the waterside.</p> <p> He lay down in a locked cell and slept. Twice a day a man in uniform brought his food. Sometimes a young woman opened the iron door and stared at him. She was skinny and small, a kind he liked, though he couldn't understand the red scars on her cheeks. </p> <p> He tried meeting her eyes, but she watched him coldly, holding her cigarette like a dart. Perhaps she knew that he daren't go home: he had deserted in the face of the enemy and might be shot. For the first time he was worried about China.</p> <p> He stayed at the clinic for a month. At first he was questioned endlessly about Korea. Watched by the woman, orderlies took blood smears or samples from his chamber pot. Then everyone grew bored. His police guard disappeared and he was moved from his cell. He ate in the small canteen and slept restlessly in a ward of empty beds. </p> <p>He sat for hours in the day room, ignored by staff who had treated him ten minutes earlier, staring into the clinic's buffalo field. Sometimes a peasant worked there, very quick and lean. He would bow extravagantly to the staff in the day room, sweeping off his cap for extra emphasis.</p> <p> A smiling man arrived. He had lived in Hong Kong and now taught English to Party workers in the town, but he couldn't understand Fraser. He would ask him to pronounce rare words, to explain situations in Shakespeare, to distinguish should from ought. He started discussions about colonialism or market economics until they were both embarrassed. Then he fell silent, shredding a cigarette into a curly English pipe clamped in the middle of his desperate grin. </p> <p> After two or three visits he declared with a sad smile that Fraser had a \"regional dialect\", and was therefore \"not greatly useful to an academic such as I\".</p> <p> Fraser had nowhere to sit but the ward and the day room, nowhere to walk but the corridor between, with its rooms full of filing cabinets or rats in cages. He stared through windows at other buildings that seemed part of the clinic. They were derelict, with scorch marks above the windows and all the glass broken: there were bullet holes in every wall.</p> <p> He couldn't leave the clinic, he was sure, but the buffalo field seemed less off limits. One afternoon, when the day room was empty, he opened a warping door and stepped into the spring air. The day was lovely, but given an edge by a cold wind from the river. The shadows of clouds raced across the field and up the steep ridge beyond.</p> <p> The gardener or stockman was spreading forage for the buffaloes. He saw Fraser and was transfixed. He dropped the hay and trotted over, his eyes and mouth wide. He came quite close, his head thrust forward, chattering softly to himself.</p> <p> He held Fraser's cuff, rubbed a button on his jacket, walked around him, still talking, and at last stared him up and down and asked loud questions in a voice that was half offended. Fraser noticed something that became familiar. It was the earth smell of a healthy peasant, dusty as geraniums.</p> <p> Whenever the stockman came Fraser brought tea from the canteen. In return he was shown things - when to feed the buffaloes, where to carry the great sacks of food for the caged rats, and how to clear winter trash from the gutters while his new friend held the ladder. The man touched himself on the nose and said his name: Tao Yumi.</p> <p> Then they had a visitor. She came to the barbed-wire fence round the buffalo field, bright as a parrot in a sky-blue waistcoat, purple turban and black cotton trousers cut to mid-calf. Brilliant embroidered straps criss-crossed her linen blouse.</p> <p> Perhaps she had been selling things in the town, because she carried two empty baskets on a shoulder pole. She gave Tao a steamed bun, leaning through the barbed wire fence but staring always at Fraser.</p> <p>Only a young policeman came with them, his collar like a hoop around his skinny neck. Tao and his wife led them through the back door of the clinic and across the stony buffalo field. They ducked under a barbed-wire fence and crossed a narrow strip of bushes.</p> <p> Beyond was the steep ridge where the policeman lagged behind, pressing on his knees as they climbed. The Taos took Fraser's arm and pointed at things. They made him repeat words and then laughed.</p> <p> They reached the top of the ridge, but only Fraser looked back at the town. He was worried. The hills were cold, and the Taos too happy.</p> <p> They walked in single file across the narrow summit. First the clinic disappeared, then the town, then the river, until they saw nothing but the tops of other hills. In the distance were mountains, still capped with snow. </p> <p> The ridge was a rubble of white stones, with cushions of tough grass behind the larger boulders. Then the valley of the Miao people opened below.</p> <p> It was a dreadful battlefield, he thought, covered with flooded shellholes. Then he saw they were fields, with buffaloes and people in the grey water.</p> <p> They followed a zigzag track down the side of the ridge. Next to the track were curved banks holding pools of water. At the bottom they stepped out onto a narrow path between the flooded fields. It soon climbed a low embankment to a cart track, which ran left and right up the middle of the valley. Fraser looked ahead to a village of wooden houses.</p> <p> It was market day. The policeman had never seen a Miao market, and laughed at the stalls of ragged old clothes, or single razor blades, or slabs of pig fat.</p> <p> Everyone stared at Fraser. A circle of women, all in purple turbans like Madame Tao, fell silent. A man stood open-mouthed as they stepped over bamboo baskets like a row of torpedoes, each with a little black pig lying helpless. An old woman bent from the waist in amazement, her one silver earring like a shark hook. There was a shout of laughter: someone had recognized the Taos.</p> <p> More waiting. Fraser squatted outside the biggest house while the policeman went inside. Tao was called, emerging with a grin. Fraser's life was being settled.</p> <p> They went even further up the valley. A line of women was planting rice in the icy water. They passed a haystack built around a wooden stake. At last the Taos stopped and pointed. Ahead was a little raised island in the fields of water, where half a dozen houses cramped together.</p> <p> The track narrowed to a footpath. There was a pile of stones, an abandoned plough, and the potent smell of shit. People were waiting in the village yard. A stocky young man stood scowling, hands on hips. More people came from the houses, chopsticks busy while their eyes widened over the rim of their bowls. All the women wore purple turbans. Firewood leaned to dry against every wall. A midden, tall as a man, stood and stank between the houses.</p> <p> There was a terrifying little boy. He stood apart from the rest, barefoot and thin. His hair was a helmet of dirt.

      "bodyText": "He was the only round-eye on board, but nobody noticed. Hugging his ankles like a peasant, he sat alone on the dented metal deck. He avoided faces, as always, watching the river from behind the funnel, quiet in the diesel stink where no one else would come. First the concrete dock slipped away, then the steep valley sides came close, squeezing the great river. It began to grumble, hurrying them more swiftly out of the mountains. Flat-footed as a Chinaman, he sat on the good canvas rucksack that always reminded him of years before, when he'd been the only round-eye in the Red Guards. The Guards had wanted to kill him, then disagreed. So they delayed their choice, marching away with the white man who walked like a peasant. On the second day they saw an old man in a field by the road. They poured down into the field and separated into three groups - the swordfish, the dragon and the swallow - competing for who could dig the deepest. Soon the old man was sinking to his knees as the leader slapped his face. They didn't finish their digging. Where they had worked, the soil was buried under gritty subsoil, the field ruined for a thousand years. Then he was sent to a Red Guard indoctrination camp. He met an old artilleryman who talked about his time firing ten shells a day across the Taiwan Straits. The Guards had chalked anti-capitalist slogans on the shells, but wrote them on the shell-cases so that the insults were spat at their feet. They had white-washed the murals in local temples and inoculated whole villages in an afternoon, their needles growing blunt on hundreds of arms and spreading Dog Tick Fever. His rucksack came from a dead peasant. The Guards had changed a shrine into a pigsty, and then discovered that this was a countryside without pigs. With joyful revolutionary songs they dragged a sow from the railhead. Six weeks later they returned to the village. There was a ham in the storehouse roof and pig bones hidden under straw, ready to be burned for fertiliser. That afternoon, resting on a hillside, he watched the executions across the valley. He knew that in the hills there were no scraps for pigs: pigs were a rich man's beast. But the peasants had only said \"Please, please,\" as they were led away. He saw the men falling in silence and then the sound like doors closing. Now he stood up, watching the other passengers from under his cap. He felt trapped again: sometimes there were police on the river boats. He went ashore at the next town and found it crowded with Westerners. They argued in front of tourist hotels, watched from cafes, loitered by racks of postcards - the first whites he had seen in thirty-five years. \"Not like the brochures,\" someone said in English. It was a grey-haired man, about his own age, talking to a large woman in a floral dress. \"The ancient marvels of an ageless civilisation,\" said the woman. \"And toilets to go with it.\" They drifted away as he watched from an alley. He was whispering to their retreating backs. \"My name is Jim,\" he murmured, as they vanished round a corner. \"Jim Fraser. Hello. Call me Jim. I have seen amazing things.\" Chapter 2 Fraser was eighteen when he came east. The troopship had docked first at Hong Kong, and he had trailed through the crowds with louder young men who somehow knew their way around. He pulled his cap low over one eye, though not so low as some of the others. Occasionally he spat. They took a rickshaw ride. Someone got tattooed. Then they were in a bar near the dockyard, and he was talking to a Chinese woman. Or rather, she talked to him. She wasn't pretty, but he was fascinated because she took care of everything. He didn't need to talk or be nice, he only had to keep his elbow in this puddle on the bar. The beers came, other girls came and went, but the woman kept her hand on his arm and said things which needed no reply. She took his hand and he felt a great jolt of desire. He looked around the bar, which was suddenly crowded and bright, but his friends from the regiment had left. \"Gone,\" said Fraser. \"All gone.\" He wasn't sure if this meant he was abandoned or free, but the woman led him outside, her strong bones gripping through the push of people. \"Very sorry,\" he said. \"Very drunk.\" Next they were in a ferry boat. He told the woman that he only felt ill because of the smell of the engine: he was never, never seasick. They travelled for a long time, then climbed a wooden ladder to the shore and passed up an alley in great darkness. Fraser started to complain, but wasn't displeased. \"I'm going home with a prostitute,\" he thought. Then he was sitting in a tiny room, an old woman watching him. This lasted for some time, but Fraser was glad because when the younger woman came back he had decided what was right. He gave her all his money, even the money in his sock, and said, \"Sleep. Sleep now.\" He woke in utter darkness, knowing what he would do. It was his first time. The woman grumbled and sighed as he entered her, but how effortlessly he was accommodated. China, he thought, China. When he woke next morning the woman had gone. He went into the tiny room next door and her mother or aunt or madam brought him tea. There seemed no pressure to leave, and anyway he wanted to ask for his money, or at least a part of it. The old woman bustled in and out while Fraser drank the whole sour pot of tea, but it was always impossible. At last, when she was gone for a moment, he hurried down a staircase as narrow as a ladder. When he got outside he needed to relieve himself. He looked along the tiny street for a bar, but recognized nothing. He stepped a few yards, searching for a quiet alley, but everywhere was crowded with Chinese. Washing spanned the streets, market stalls blocked the way. There was nothing familiar except an anonymous span of sky. He bundled his army jacket and hid it under his arm. He toiled up and around the tiny alleys while his urgent need came and went and came back stronger than ever. He brushed through crowds, for the first time in his life seeing no one taller than himself. Then he had a brainwave. He headed quickly downhill. He thought he passed the prostitute's house but wasn't sure and didn't stop. Soon he would find the port. The alley grew suddenly steeper, turned sharply right, and then Fraser halted. In front of him it reared steeply uphill again. He was standing on stones the size of suitcases. Between them was the glint of water. It was a tiny flat bridge over a tiny stream. He had been descending into a steep valley, and now the street invited him up the other side. He stepped off the bridge. There was a path running downstream, and he hurried past the backs of wooden houses that grew more squalid. An old man with no teeth quacked from the far bank. Pot-bellied children, naked but for a ragged shirt, paused in their scampering. And still there was nowhere to piss. Across the stream the houses gave way to a scrubby wood. He teetered across on wobbling stones, but found that the ground between the bushes was trodden solid. He imagined his piss running for yards across the bare earth, and pushed uphill into deeper undergrowth. At last, trembling and sweating, he drained his pee and his strength. He leaned back against a tree. After a minute he opened his eyes and blinked with surprise. Over the shoulder of a hill he could see the main Hong Kong harbour, crowded with ships. He'd come completely the wrong way. After a while he climbed further up the wooded slope. At the top he was disappointed again: he had thought Hong Kong was small. Inland, blue hills stepped into the distance, but there was nothing that looked like China. \"Hand grenades have these little squares on them,\" the sergeant had said. \"It's like they make bars of chocolate, so that every bugger gets a bit.\" Fraser saw the flash of his grenade that night in Korea. He forgot to duck and a pine tree lit up for a moment like a green army tent. Surely they would ignore him, the Chinese, if they overran the camp. All through the freezing night he was scared and incredulous: whatever he did the Communists would notice even him. But nobody was killed, just a Chinese, and they tramped through the snow to search the body. It was frozen solid, with bits of blood in its clothes like stained glass, but they raised it with enormous effort and left it sitting on a tree stump, one eye open and a hand cupped by its ear like someone deaf. They evacuated the camp, part of the general UN collapse, and fled south through the terrible Chinese ambush around Kunu-ri and on to a great Allied regrouping. The ice turned to mud, the rivers flooded and everyone thought they were going home. Instead a dozen of them climbed into Bren carriers and went back to the war, or 'back to front' as they all said. Two units, one American and one Turkish, had been left behind in the general rout. They were never found. At least, not before Fraser deserted. They were parked close to an empty village. The Chinese were coming, and the officer smoked hard as he studied their route back. Fraser was no longer the youngest, but still had to clean the sergeant's boots. He had to lend money, too, which somehow he could never ask for, and before every meal he was sent with a jerrycan to the nearest stream, because there were reports of wells being poisoned. Here it meant a long hike across a ploughed field. They had been issued with woollen cap-comforters against the bitter winds, but the sergeant insisted they wore them straight, which left their ears exposed: Fraser pulled his cap right down the moment he entered the woods where the Chinese had camped. There were cigarette packets, a latrine stink, and what looked like a Chinese army newspaper. Its flimsy pages were melting to paste, but Fraser had a favourite picture. An ant raced across the page as he gazed at the broad face of a peasant girl, leaning on a shovel and gazing into the sun. This is what they're fighting for, he thought. He remembered a story that one of the veterans had told him. It had happened to a friend who was driving a tank in North Africa. Their CO was a bastard. He gave every crew a tarpaulin and made them paint the outline of all the tools they carried. On inspections they laid out this tarpaulin with each tool in its outline, and they'd twice had their pay docked for losing things. Then the tank was on patrol and shed one of its tracks. This always took hours to fix, especially on sand, and when they got back they'd be nailed for not keeping it tensioned. They were packing up when they realized they'd lost a brass key the size of a thumb. They searched everywhere, blaming each other, but of course it was sunk somewhere under the sand. They couldn't waste any more time so they set fire to the tank and walked back. It was only four or five miles, and quite pleasant in the evening cool. They had time to sort out a story about running over some kind of mine or unexploded shell. Fraser tried to pick up the Chinese newspaper, but it fell to bits in his fingers. He threw the jerrycan into the bushes and walked into the woods, directly away from his unit. He spent two nights amongst ravenous fleas in the deserted village and two days lying flat in the middle of the ploughed field, watching the road. It was very cold, but he thought about the sergeant and the officer trying to explain his desertion. They'd have to admit ill-treating him. They'd be court-martialled. At last the Chinese came. He wouldn't surrender to front-line troops, waiting instead for cooks and wagon drivers. Then a jeep pulled up. The driver unloaded camp stools, and two officers climbed out and sat drinking tea, a map on the ground between them. Fraser stood up. He raised his hands and waited for a long minute until the officers grew still. For three days he sat only on the floor: in guard rooms, outside in the cold, and wedged between the benches on a troop train. Then he was ill. He remembered being picked up by two soldiers and soiling himself and them. For a time he lay in a hospital tent that was crowded but silent. He was getting better when they put him in an ambulance. He bounced over rough roads, guarded by a soldier in an antiseptic mask. Twice the ambulance stopped and his chamber pot was carried to the roadside. Fraser watched from the window as diesel was poured in and set alight. At a large prison they took his army clothes and dressed him in thin cotton. He shivered for a week while a sneering young man wrote down everything he said about Korea. After that there was a kind of progress. He rode a train for four days until it was warm like Hong Kong. In police vans or converted buses he followed a river upstream as the roads got worse and the air cooler. It was obvious when he reached the end of his journey. Chapter 3 Very faint and dizzy he had stared without interest at yet another small town. Here, though, he had to get down from the truck. He tottered up steep alleys past dirty wooden houses. Every vista ended with a hill or the river. On the far bank, mountains crowded to the waterside. He lay down in a locked cell and slept. Twice a day a man in uniform brought his food. Sometimes a young woman opened the iron door and stared at him. She was skinny and small, a kind he liked, though he couldn't understand the red scars on her cheeks. He tried meeting her eyes, but she watched him coldly, holding her cigarette like a dart. Perhaps she knew that he daren't go home: he had deserted in the face of the enemy and might be shot. For the first time he was worried about China. He stayed at the clinic for a month. At first he was questioned endlessly about Korea. Watched by the woman, orderlies took blood smears or samples from his chamber pot. Then everyone grew bored. His police guard disappeared and he was moved from his cell. He ate in the small canteen and slept restlessly in a ward of empty beds. He sat for hours in the day room, ignored by staff who had treated him ten minutes earlier, staring into the clinic's buffalo field. Sometimes a peasant worked there, very quick and lean. He would bow extravagantly to the staff in the day room, sweeping off his cap for extra emphasis. A smiling man arrived. He had lived in Hong Kong and now taught English to Party workers in the town, but he couldn't understand Fraser. He would ask him to pronounce rare words, to explain situations in Shakespeare, to distinguish should from ought. He started discussions about colonialism or market economics until they were both embarrassed. Then he fell silent, shredding a cigarette into a curly English pipe clamped in the middle of his desperate grin. After two or three visits he declared with a sad smile that Fraser had a \"regional dialect\", and was therefore \"not greatly useful to an academic such as I\". Fraser had nowhere to sit but the ward and the day room, nowhere to walk but the corridor between, with its rooms full of filing cabinets or rats in cages. He stared through windows at other buildings that seemed part of the clinic. They were derelict, with scorch marks above the windows and all the glass broken: there were bullet holes in every wall. He couldn't leave the clinic, he was sure, but the buffalo field seemed less off limits. One afternoon, when the day room was empty, he opened a warping door and stepped into the spring air. The day was lovely, but given an edge by a cold wind from the river. The shadows of clouds raced across the field and up the steep ridge beyond. The gardener or stockman was spreading forage for the buffaloes. He saw Fraser and was transfixed. He dropped the hay and trotted over, his eyes and mouth wide. He came quite close, his head thrust forward, chattering softly to himself. He held Fraser's cuff, rubbed a button on his jacket, walked around him, still talking, and at last stared him up and down and asked loud questions in a voice that was half offended. Fraser noticed something that became familiar. It was the earth smell of a healthy peasant, dusty as geraniums. Whenever the stockman came Fraser brought tea from the canteen. In return he was shown things - when to feed the buffaloes, where to carry the great sacks of food for the caged rats, and how to clear winter trash from the gutters while his new friend held the ladder. The man touched himself on the nose and said his name: Tao Yumi. Then they had a visitor. She came to the barbed-wire fence round the buffalo field, bright as a parrot in a sky-blue waistcoat, purple turban and black cotton trousers cut to mid-calf. Brilliant embroidered straps criss-crossed her linen blouse. Perhaps she had been selling things in the town, because she carried two empty baskets on a shoulder pole. She gave Tao a steamed bun, leaning through the barbed wire fence but staring always at Fraser. Only a young policeman came with them, his collar like a hoop around his skinny neck. Tao and his wife led them through the back door of the clinic and across the stony buffalo field. They ducked under a barbed-wire fence and crossed a narrow strip of bushes. Beyond was the steep ridge where the policeman lagged behind, pressing on his knees as they climbed. The Taos took Fraser's arm and pointed at things. They made him repeat words and then laughed. They reached the top of the ridge, but only Fraser looked back at the town. He was worried. The hills were cold, and the Taos too happy. They walked in single file across the narrow summit. First the clinic disappeared, then the town, then the river, until they saw nothing but the tops of other hills. In the distance were mountains, still capped with snow. The ridge was a rubble of white stones, with cushions of tough grass behind the larger boulders. Then the valley of the Miao people opened below. It was a dreadful battlefield, he thought, covered with flooded shellholes. Then he saw they were fields, with buffaloes and people in the grey water. They followed a zigzag track down the side of the ridge. Next to the track were curved banks holding pools of water. At the bottom they stepped out onto a narrow path between the flooded fields. It soon climbed a low embankment to a cart track, which ran left and right up the middle of the valley. Fraser looked ahead to a village of wooden houses. It was market day. The policeman had never seen a Miao market, and laughed at the stalls of ragged old clothes, or single razor blades, or slabs of pig fat. Everyone stared at Fraser. A circle of women, all in purple turbans like Madame Tao, fell silent. A man stood open-mouthed as they stepped over bamboo baskets like a row of torpedoes, each with a little black pig lying helpless. An old woman bent from the waist in amazement, her one silver earring like a shark hook. There was a shout of laughter: someone had recognized the Taos. More waiting. Fraser squatted outside the biggest house while the policeman went inside. Tao was called, emerging with a grin. Fraser's life was being settled. They went even further up the valley. A line of women was planting rice in the icy water. They passed a haystack built around a wooden stake. At last the Taos stopped and pointed. Ahead was a little raised island in the fields of water, where half a dozen houses cramped together. The track narrowed to a footpath. There was a pile of stones, an abandoned plough, and the potent smell of shit. People were waiting in the village yard. A stocky young man stood scowling, hands on hips. More people came from the houses, chopsticks busy while their eyes widened over the rim of their bowls. All the women wore purple turbans. Firewood leaned to dry against every wall. A midden, tall as a man, stood and stank between the houses. There was a terrifying little boy. He stood apart from the rest, barefoot and thin. His hair was a helmet of dirt. His clothes were grey sacking, hanging in rags to his bony knees. Perhaps he had risen from the grave to greet them. Fraser seemed to faint or half-faint. He was helped inside to a stool at a cluttered table. Villagers pressed close as he swayed over a steaming cup, and at last he was put to bed. The bed was lumpy but warm under a grey quilt, and he slept and slept. He was on a ledge behind a curtain, and dozed through the days listening to Madame Tao in the main room. In the evenings Tao arrived from the fields and the couple woke him with rice. At night he lay awake as the wind rushed between the houses. He was troubled by the calling of children and woke once to a chicken's beady gaze. People lifted the curtain while he dozed. 'You were young,' Madame Tao said later. 'Very young and small, so nobody hated you.' On the third evening Fraser sat up in bed. He peered around the curtain and the Taos rose with welcoming cries. Madame Tao gave them each a cup and poured hot water from a blackened pot. Fraser, because he was ill, got a pinch of tea. He sat up, shy in his alcove, while the Taos fussed around him. This was the start of his new life.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Michael March: </strong> Talking about the rather invisible oligarchy in America, do people really have any concept of its existence?</p> <p><strong>Gore Vidal: </strong>James Madison, who is very much the creator of our Constitution, said: \"Never forget that the iron law of oligarchy always obtains; few people will always run everything, no matter what the institution or what the country.\" The Constitution was carefully arranged for white men of property. Since then the franchise has been extended to the young, the black, the female; but because the sense of our oligarchy is everywhere, people don't know about it, they have no place to find out.</p> <p> When we decided to become a global empire after the war, it was Harry Truman who dropped two atomic bombs on Japan and made us a national security state and a militarised economy. Our citizens were not advised, they still don't know. They still think that it's a free, open country, but we decided to stay armed and to be involved in every country in the world. That was their decision - and who are 'they'? They are traditionally the very wealthy: the one per cent that my cousin Al Gore dared mention at one point in the campaign as owning practically all the property in the country.</p> <p> The one per cent dominates. They reign through 20% of the country who are doing very well. These are the prosperous people who we read about, people that are put in Congress and in the White House. Eighty per cent of the people are doing very badly and are rather poor.</p> <p> <strong>MM:</strong> You mentioned President Truman's decision to drop the bomb, but there were other people behind Truman. Was Truman a stooge of a greater force?</p> <p><strong>GV:</strong> Well, under our system any president is a stooge of the great financial forces that own or govern the country. The brains behind Truman belonged to Dean Acheson, who was a brilliant man, very witty and very imperial. \"If anyone disobeys the United States, we must destroy them.\" He was a throwback to an earlier time, but he was the one who helped Truman militarise the economy, create Nato and the CIA, interfere with elections and get rid of the Bill of Rights. I don't say he sat down and did everything in order, but that was the result. </p> <p> So on the one hand you have the pressure of the military, who had developed these extraordinary weapons, which they wanted to test; and on the other palm, Truman vacillated, seeing that it was going to change the nature of warfare and knowing perfectly well the Japanese were defeated. So we made a big deal over \"unconditional surrender\". As it turned out, Japan completely collapsed after two bombs, but it was interesting the extent to which Eisenhower denounced it publicly. Admiral Nimitz, the great figure in the Pacific, denounced it. Curtis LeMay, who as a war-lover liked to blow up everything, denounced it. They all said the same thing: we didn't need it. And why use it twice? They were going to surrender.</p> <p> I don't think there was one single general officer in that war who approved of it, and they all went public very quickly to denounce their Commander-in-Chief Truman, who had dropped it for one reason: to intimidate Stalin, keep him out of the Pacific war, let him have no share of the peace that we were going to impose on Japan, and just keep him nervous. And it worked. Then a year or two later we divided Germany, taking the best part for ourselves, and made Stalin the world's enemy to justify our military build-up, which then started all over again and continues to this day.</p> <p><strong>MM: </strong> How do you see the occupation of eastern Europe, the bent line of Stalin through Brezhnev?</p> <p><strong>GV: </strong>Well, having been a Russia-watcher all my life, their policies have always been reactive - back to Peter the Great. And reactionary. They were so terrified, having been invaded quite a few times from the West - they felt quite naked there. We promised $20bn worth of reparations at Yalta and reconfirmed our promise at Potsdam. They never got it. We said that we would include them in the Marshal Plan. We didn't. They took the position that we had declared war on them, by the division of Germany and by the re-arming of the Germans. That was the red flag that really scared them. So then they tried to get us out of the Berlin, that failed; then later they tried the business of the air-lift and that failed. </p> <p>They then began to collect the border states, as buffers. Yes, they behaved very badly to the buffer states. They moved in. There is this story of Czechoslovakia and that bone-headed Ambassador Steinhardt who made every error on earth in dealing with the Russians. We could have kept Czechoslovakia from Russia's grasp, but he made a series of wrong moves and no one knows the true story. </p> <p>They were going to make sure that they controlled a row of states in eastern Europe. They also needed to steal money and manufacturing plants, as they didn't have anything left. When they left central Europe to return gradually to their homeland, they didn't have enough trucks and tractors, so they used horses to pull their cannons back into holy Russia. They were that poor and that knocked down after losing 20m people. </p> <p>So the fact is that they were paranoid and behaved extremely badly with their satellite countries, and we behaved rather better with ours, because we were much richer and it was easier for us to bribe the Italian communist party than it would have been to send troops there to shoot communists, which the Russians would have done. So each behaved according to his financial capacity.</p> <p><strong>MM: </strong>Was the cold war a complete illusion?</p> <p><strong>GV:</strong> No, it was a complete fact. But it was based on an illusion that the Russians were coming. This was the propaganda that never ever let up, until finally Gorbachev dissolved the whole story. We had maintained the myth in order to keep 51% of the US budget for a military which has no enemy.</p> <p> And they're going to increase it and increase it. We have a junta now running the country from the Pentagon. Vice-President Cheney is our Bismarck, he's the Chancellor; Rumsfeld is his side-kick at the Defense Department; Collin Powell is from the military. It's a total Pentagon government dedicated to more and more weapons and more and more enemies. There's Gaddafy one month, Saddam the next. As Charles A. Beard, our great historian, said: \"America's post-war policy is very clear. The United States is dedicated to perpetual war for perpetual peace.\" </p> <p>And that's what we've been doing for 60 years. We've lost the educational system for the general public. No health care, civil liberties are diminishing, and government harassment is more intense than anywhere other than in a pure communist state, where it is easier and cheaper to control people. We have mandatory blood tests, urine tests in the workplace. We are at war with drugs, which means that we can arrest anybody anytime we feel like it, and we do. </p> <p>We have 6.6m people in prison, or in correction, as they call it. That's three per cent of the adult population. We build more prisons in the United States than we do schools, and the schools that we have are a wreck, as far as educating the general public. Those of us who belong to a somewhat higher class have a better educational system, but much more subtle indoctrination. </p> <p> <strong>MM:</strong> Do you feel lonely?</p> <p><strong>GV: </strong>I wouldn't mind a little more assistance, yes. I forget who it was in the 19th century who said that intellectuals are the only elite - the only minority on earth - that wishes to extend its ranks. Most elites want to shrink so that they have more to themselves. We are the only ones who want more and more of us, not less and less. But our system, that oligarchy we have been talking about earlier, is totally efficient. </p> <p>For instance, throughout the 50s into the 80s, I was a fixture on national television. When they wanted a liberal voice, or whatever adjective was in use at the time, they turned to me. And I had a considerable following. I even had my own program for a while. By the time of the Reagan revolution - the coup d'\u00e9tat - I had been erased from television. The press won't report me, television is shut to me, I've been erased. Noam Chomsky never had a chance, he never had a great public; but I had one through my books and movies and plays and of course essay writing. Now I am no longer a guest on anything where I might cause trouble, where I might say something that they would find embarrassing, which would be practically anything I would say about how the country is run.

      "bodyText": "Michael March: Talking about the rather invisible oligarchy in America, do people really have any concept of its existence? Gore Vidal: James Madison, who is very much the creator of our Constitution, said: \"Never forget that the iron law of oligarchy always obtains; few people will always run everything, no matter what the institution or what the country.\" The Constitution was carefully arranged for white men of property. Since then the franchise has been extended to the young, the black, the female; but because the sense of our oligarchy is everywhere, people don't know about it, they have no place to find out. When we decided to become a global empire after the war, it was Harry Truman who dropped two atomic bombs on Japan and made us a national security state and a militarised economy. Our citizens were not advised, they still don't know. They still think that it's a free, open country, but we decided to stay armed and to be involved in every country in the world. That was their decision - and who are 'they'? They are traditionally the very wealthy: the one per cent that my cousin Al Gore dared mention at one point in the campaign as owning practically all the property in the country. The one per cent dominates. They reign through 20% of the country who are doing very well. These are the prosperous people who we read about, people that are put in Congress and in the White House. Eighty per cent of the people are doing very badly and are rather poor. MM: You mentioned President Truman's decision to drop the bomb, but there were other people behind Truman. Was Truman a stooge of a greater force? GV: Well, under our system any president is a stooge of the great financial forces that own or govern the country. The brains behind Truman belonged to Dean Acheson, who was a brilliant man, very witty and very imperial. \"If anyone disobeys the United States, we must destroy them.\" He was a throwback to an earlier time, but he was the one who helped Truman militarise the economy, create Nato and the CIA, interfere with elections and get rid of the Bill of Rights. I don't say he sat down and did everything in order, but that was the result. So on the one hand you have the pressure of the military, who had developed these extraordinary weapons, which they wanted to test; and on the other palm, Truman vacillated, seeing that it was going to change the nature of warfare and knowing perfectly well the Japanese were defeated. So we made a big deal over \"unconditional surrender\". As it turned out, Japan completely collapsed after two bombs, but it was interesting the extent to which Eisenhower denounced it publicly. Admiral Nimitz, the great figure in the Pacific, denounced it. Curtis LeMay, who as a war-lover liked to blow up everything, denounced it. They all said the same thing: we didn't need it. And why use it twice? They were going to surrender. I don't think there was one single general officer in that war who approved of it, and they all went public very quickly to denounce their Commander-in-Chief Truman, who had dropped it for one reason: to intimidate Stalin, keep him out of the Pacific war, let him have no share of the peace that we were going to impose on Japan, and just keep him nervous. And it worked. Then a year or two later we divided Germany, taking the best part for ourselves, and made Stalin the world's enemy to justify our military build-up, which then started all over again and continues to this day. MM: How do you see the occupation of eastern Europe, the bent line of Stalin through Brezhnev? GV: Well, having been a Russia-watcher all my life, their policies have always been reactive - back to Peter the Great. And reactionary. They were so terrified, having been invaded quite a few times from the West - they felt quite naked there. We promised $20bn worth of reparations at Yalta and reconfirmed our promise at Potsdam. They never got it. We said that we would include them in the Marshal Plan. We didn't. They took the position that we had declared war on them, by the division of Germany and by the re-arming of the Germans. That was the red flag that really scared them. So then they tried to get us out of the Berlin, that failed; then later they tried the business of the air-lift and that failed. They then began to collect the border states, as buffers. Yes, they behaved very badly to the buffer states. They moved in. There is this story of Czechoslovakia and that bone-headed Ambassador Steinhardt who made every error on earth in dealing with the Russians. We could have kept Czechoslovakia from Russia's grasp, but he made a series of wrong moves and no one knows the true story. They were going to make sure that they controlled a row of states in eastern Europe. They also needed to steal money and manufacturing plants, as they didn't have anything left. When they left central Europe to return gradually to their homeland, they didn't have enough trucks and tractors, so they used horses to pull their cannons back into holy Russia. They were that poor and that knocked down after losing 20m people. So the fact is that they were paranoid and behaved extremely badly with their satellite countries, and we behaved rather better with ours, because we were much richer and it was easier for us to bribe the Italian communist party than it would have been to send troops there to shoot communists, which the Russians would have done. So each behaved according to his financial capacity. MM: Was the cold war a complete illusion? GV: No, it was a complete fact. But it was based on an illusion that the Russians were coming. This was the propaganda that never ever let up, until finally Gorbachev dissolved the whole story. We had maintained the myth in order to keep 51% of the US budget for a military which has no enemy. And they're going to increase it and increase it. We have a junta now running the country from the Pentagon. Vice-President Cheney is our Bismarck, he's the Chancellor; Rumsfeld is his side-kick at the Defense Department; Collin Powell is from the military. It's a total Pentagon government dedicated to more and more weapons and more and more enemies. There's Gaddafy one month, Saddam the next. As Charles A. Beard, our great historian, said: \"America's post-war policy is very clear. The United States is dedicated to perpetual war for perpetual peace.\" And that's what we've been doing for 60 years. We've lost the educational system for the general public. No health care, civil liberties are diminishing, and government harassment is more intense than anywhere other than in a pure communist state, where it is easier and cheaper to control people. We have mandatory blood tests, urine tests in the workplace. We are at war with drugs, which means that we can arrest anybody anytime we feel like it, and we do. We have 6.6m people in prison, or in correction, as they call it. That's three per cent of the adult population. We build more prisons in the United States than we do schools, and the schools that we have are a wreck, as far as educating the general public. Those of us who belong to a somewhat higher class have a better educational system, but much more subtle indoctrination. MM: Do you feel lonely? GV: I wouldn't mind a little more assistance, yes. I forget who it was in the 19th century who said that intellectuals are the only elite - the only minority on earth - that wishes to extend its ranks. Most elites want to shrink so that they have more to themselves. We are the only ones who want more and more of us, not less and less. But our system, that oligarchy we have been talking about earlier, is totally efficient. For instance, throughout the 50s into the 80s, I was a fixture on national television. When they wanted a liberal voice, or whatever adjective was in use at the time, they turned to me. And I had a considerable following. I even had my own program for a while. By the time of the Reagan revolution - the coup d'\u00e9tat - I had been erased from television. The press won't report me, television is shut to me, I've been erased. Noam Chomsky never had a chance, he never had a great public; but I had one through my books and movies and plays and of course essay writing. Now I am no longer a guest on anything where I might cause trouble, where I might say something that they would find embarrassing, which would be practically anything I would say about how the country is run. So I am the perfect example of censorship in the United States. MM: Yet you have not been destroyed. GV: Well, I think I'm tougher than most people, and I find ways of getting through. And I connect with a very large audience. A majority of the thinking people of the country - and that must be five per cent - are with me and they support me. They buy the books, they come to hear me speak. And I am too difficult to catch. I am a member of the ruling oligarchy, and I am sort of off-limits for them.

With this feat, we play God with our evolutionary destiny, and risk ominous consequences for the future of civilisation. Already researchers are readying the first experiments and the world anxiously awaits this \"second coming\" - except this time the child will have been produced by science and in the image of a specific human being. </p> <p>This scares many people but, proponents argue, why not? If, for example, an infertile couple desires to pass on their genetic inheritance by producing clones of one or both partners, shouldn't they be able to exercise their right of choice? Moreover, we are told not to be overly concerned because even though the clone will have the exact same genetic makeup as the original, he or she will develop differently because the social and environmental context within which his or her life unfolds will not be the same as the donor. </p> <p>Some professional ethicists, on the other hand, shake their heads and mutter about the yuck factor - people's initial disgust at the prospect of cloning a human being - but when pressed, can offer few, if any, compelling reasons to oppose what they consider to be inevitable and even worthwhile, under certain circumstances. Their only misgivings appear to be whether or not the procedure is safe and whether the baby would be malformed. Right to life advocates worry, in turn, that embryos used in the procedure will be wasted or discarded in attempts to produce a successful clone. Unfortunately, the deeper issues surrounding the cloning of a human being have received short shrift or no attention at all. </p> <p>The cloning of a human raises fundamental questions that go to the very nature of what it means to be a human being. No other single event in human history will have had as great an effect on the future of our species. Here are the reasons why. To begin with, our very notion of what life is all about is immersed in sexuality and the biological attraction of male and female. Much of the history of civilisation has played out along sexual lines, from mating rituals to the notions of family, clan, tribe and nation. From time immemorial we have thought of the birth of our progeny as a gift bestowed by God and or a beneficent nature. The coming together of sperm and egg represents a moment of surrender to forces outside of our control. The fusing of maleness and femaleness results in a unique and finite new creation. </p> <p>The reason most people have an almost instinctual repulsion to cloning is that deep down, they sense that it signals the beginning of a new journey where the \"gift of life\" is steadily marginalised and eventually abandoned all together. In its place, the new progeny becomes the ultimate shopping experience - designed in advance, produced to specification and purchased in the biological marketplace. </p> <p>Cloning is, first and foremost, an act of \"production\", not creation. Using the new biotechnologies, a living being is produced with the same degree of engineering as we have come to expect on an assembly line. When we think of engineering standards, what immediately comes to mind is quality controls and predictable outcomes. That's exactly what cloning a human being is all about. For the first time in the history of our species, we can dictate the final genetic constitution of the offspring. The child is no longer a unique creation - one of a kind - but rather a reproduction. Human cloning opens the door wide to the dawn of a commercial eugenics civilisation, a brave new world where new technologies speed the process of \"improving\" our offspring, allowing us to create a second genesis. This time, each person can become a private god and make offspring in his or her own image. </p> <p>In the future - certainly by the time today's babies reach adulthood - it will be possible to make genetic changes in the donor cell or embryo and begin creating customised variations of the original. Ian Wilmut, of the Roslin Institute, near Edinburgh, has already accomplished this feat in his second cloned sheep. Though less celebrated than Dolly, the birth of Polly is far more ominous. With Polly, Wilmut's team customised a human gene into a sheep cell and then cloned the sheep, making it the first truly \"designer animal\". Using the clone as a \"standard model\", scientists can now produce endless customised variations suited to the requisites of their clients. </p> <p> Does anyone doubt for a moment that what Wilmut accomplished with Polly won't be made available by the biotech industry to parents who would like to produce cloned designer babies? Again, proponents argue, why not? If a prospective parent knew they were likely to pass on a genetic predisposition for heart disease, or stroke, or cancer, wouldn't they feel obligated to spare their clone by eliminating those genes in the donor cell or embryo? But where does one draw the line? What if the parent knew he or she was likely to pass on a genetic predisposition for bipolar manic depression, or dyslexia, or growth hormone deficiency, or a cleft palate? Doesn't every parent want the best possible life for their child? In the future, some would argue, parental responsibility and intervention ought to begin at the design stage, in the donor cell or cloned embryo. </p> <p>Customised human cloning offers the spectre of a new kind of immortality. Each generation of a particular genotype can become the ultimate artist, continually customising and upgrading new genetic traits into the model with the goal of both perfecting and perpetuating the genotype forever. It would be naive to believe that there aren't lots of people who would leap at the opportunity. Researchers at fertility clinics say that they are already besieged by requests to clone. </p> <p>The real threat that human cloning represents is one that, as far as I know, is never talked about by scientists, ethicists, biotech entrepreneurs, or politicians. In a society where more and more people clone and eventually customise their genotype to design specifications and engineering standards, how are we likely to regard the child who isn't cloned or customised? What about the child who is born with a \"disability\"? Will the rest of society view that child with tolerance or come to see the child as an error in the genetic code - in short a defective product? Indeed, future generations might become far less tolerant of those who are not engineered and who deviate from the genetic standards and norms adhered to in the \"best practices\" of the bioindustrial marketplace. If that were to happen, we might lose the most precious gift of all, the human capacity to empathise with each other. When we empathise with another human being, it's because we feel and experience their vulnerability, their frailties and suffering, and their unique struggle to claim their humanity. But, in a world that comes to expect perfection in its offspring, can empathy really survive? </p> <p>Human cloning represents the ultimate Faustian bargain.

Dr Heffernan is not sure why ecstasy impairs the memory of regular users, but research in associated areas points to a biological explanation. It is feared that regular use may cause damage to the frontal and pre-frontal cortex of the brain, which are used in planning and strategy. If the explanation lies in biology, Dr Heffernan said, it could have particularly worrying consequences for young ecstasy users. \"There is some evidence that the frontal cortex is still developing in teenagers and adolescents,\" he said. \"If your brain is still developing in parts, there is a strong possibility you could be seriously damaging this development with ecstasy use.\" The researchers plan to expand their study to see if the damage to memory is permanent or whether the brain can be rehabilitated.

When he arrived in 1983, the situation in South Africa was at its ugliest, with the Botha government cracking down in the face of growing opposition on all fronts - internal resistance, ANC guerrilla warfare, wars in the frontline states and the condemnation of the world outside: there was no hint of the settlement that was to come.</p> <p>Heedless of opposition and, indeed, of personal risk, Peake proposed a revolutionary series of reforms for the school, not least to enlarge its racial mix - out of 930 pupils, only 45 were non-whites, of whom only seven were black. Bishop's was at that time in a timewarp. Though maintaining high academic and sporting standards, the school had no orchestra, no theatre (only one play a year in the gymnasium), no woodwork or design and only the most basic facilities for art. The director of music also ran the tennis, while the art master doubled, most unwillingly, as head of the cadet corps.</p> <p>Peake lost no time in trying to implement changes. An appeal was launched with the enthusiastic backing and support of the school council, and this proved so successful that a spectacular building programme was completed over the next four years. A new theatre, art school, sports hall, day house, sixth form centre, mathematics and computer block, squash court, climbing wall, woodwork centre and six staff houses were all constructed in this period, and the school site was quite literally transformed.</p> <p>At the same time, Peake sought out sponsors for scholarships for black boys, and largely through personal contacts succeeded in bringing to Bishop's a number of Xhosa boys from the local townships, virtually all from deprived backgrounds. By 1988, there were 150 non-white boys in the school, of whom 41 were black.</p> <p>Among the more liberal-thinking parents and old boys these changes were welcomed, but they were to prove very unpopular both with the traditionalists, who were still predominantly concerned with image and sporting success, especially in rugby, and with the right-wingers.</p> <p>John Wiley, an old boy and member of PW Botha's government, had written to the chairman of council on Peake's appointment, demanding that a time limit should be set within which Peake would have to learn Afrikaans.

If boys are not talented at games, they can still play or at least support their teams.\"</p> <p>By 1988, despite the fact that the school was fuller than it had ever been and was flourishing in almost every sphere, the level of opposition was formidable and a concerted campaign was launched to get rid of Peake. At the old boy AGM, a very large crowd was brought together to hear Peake's review of the preceding year. This was ignored, and a series of speakers then rose to denounce his policies in the most virulent terms. In the light of this the council felt that he had become altogether too controversial a figure and asked for his resignation. A financial settlement was agreed and Peake finally left in July 1988.</p> <p>In 1999, a wholly different council invited Peake and his wife back to Cape Town to attend the school's 150th anniversary celebrations. It was made clear on both sides that the reconciliation was complete.</p> <p>Peake had been imbued from an early age with a sense of injustice about the system in South Africa. He was educated in England but spent his holidays abroad - his father was a diplomat, becoming ambassador to Yugoslavia and Greece. After Eton and King's College, Cambridge, where he read history, he did national service and then briefly worked for Shell in Brazil.</p> <p>But then he was recruited by Sir Robert Birley, the anti-apartheid Eton headmaster, to teach, and he returned to his old school. There, with zest, energy and generosity of spirit, his history teaching was characterised by his ability to bringthe subject to life and to get the best out of his pupils; he set up a class on Africa at Eton which, although outside the curriculum, was invariably packed. As a rowing coach, he also took Eton to some of the school's greatest rowing victories.</p> <p>On his return from South Africa, he became principal of Queen Elizabeth training college, Leatherhead, for the disabled. He retired in 1996 and went to live in his home in Dorchester.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Susan, and son and daughter.</p> <p>\u0095 John Sebastian Brinsley Peake, teacher, born February 11 1933; died March 11 2001</p>",

In 1999, a wholly different council invited Peake and his wife back to Cape Town to attend the school's 150th anniversary celebrations. It was made clear on both sides that the reconciliation was complete. Peake had been imbued from an early age with a sense of injustice about the system in South Africa. He was educated in England but spent his holidays abroad - his father was a diplomat, becoming ambassador to Yugoslavia and Greece. After Eton and King's College, Cambridge, where he read history, he did national service and then briefly worked for Shell in Brazil. But then he was recruited by Sir Robert Birley, the anti-apartheid Eton headmaster, to teach, and he returned to his old school. There, with zest, energy and generosity of spirit, his history teaching was characterised by his ability to bringthe subject to life and to get the best out of his pupils; he set up a class on Africa at Eton which, although outside the curriculum, was invariably packed. As a rowing coach, he also took Eton to some of the school's greatest rowing victories. On his return from South Africa, he became principal of Queen Elizabeth training college, Leatherhead, for the disabled. He retired in 1996 and went to live in his home in Dorchester. He is survived by his wife, Susan, and son and daughter. \u0095 John Sebastian Brinsley Peake, teacher, born February 11 1933; died March 11 2001",

      "body": "<p>The home secretary, Jack Straw, has overruled the prisons minister, Paul Boateng, in a Home Office clash over how to keep discipline inside youth jails, according to Whitehall papers leaked to the Guardian. </p> <p>Mr Boateng objected to a more liberal approach now being introduced of releasing early those juveniles who behaved well, saying it would lead to suggestions that the prison service was rewarding them with reduced sentences as the only way to get them to behave. </p> <p>The approach also brought a warning from the director-general of prisons, Martin Narey, about whether he could make it work. </p> <p>But Mr Straw rejected Mr Boateng's criticism and backed demands from Lord Warner, head of the youth justice board, for a more liberal use of the carrot rather than the stick. </p> <p>The options under the incentive scheme to enforce discipline among the more troublesome teenagers include rewarding good behaviour with early release, in-cell television and allowing them more trips home during their sentence. </p> <p>The clash between liberal and hardline approaches at the highest levels of the Home Office took place after prison governors complained that the new juvenile detention and training orders did not give them the power to add extra days to a sentence for bad behaviour. </p> <p>A leaked letter from Mr Narey to Mr Straw of February 12 makes clear that the home secretary rejected the option of new legislation to restore the punishment power of governors for juveniles under 18. </p> <p>\"In consideration of this I wanted to be open about how I will be encouraging governors to use the incentive of early release to encourage good order. You will remember that at a recent bilateral Paul Boateng expressed some concern about that,\" Mr Narey wrote, going on to make clear that he recognised some of the prison minister's concerns. </p> <p>He said most young offenders' institutions were coping well, but there was a problem in three jails where the over 18s, who could be punished with extra days, were held alongside the under 18s, who could not. </p> <p>Mr Narey also said the scheme was in danger of undermining the anti-drugs policy, which has so far proved successful because a positive drug test inevitably led to extra days on the sentence. \"But a juvenile who tests positive for drugs can have no such sanction imposed.\" </p> <p>He said nothing could be done about teenage offenders who smashed up their cells. If governors reported the matter to police, the courts had no custodial sanction because \"the maximum available sentence for criminal damage under \u00a35,000 is a three month period in custody, and the detention and training order [DTO] is a minimum of four months. </p> <p>\"We are doing everything we can to manage this and trying to make the system work. I think we can. But you need to know that to do so I am encouraging governors to exploit the ability of governors to release juveniles early from the custodial part of the DTO if they have made good progress with their sentence plan. </p> <p>\"In other words I am saying that I think we can manage without the stick if we can make reasonably liberal use of the carrot. </p> <p>\"We have no intention of making early release routine.

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Jack Straw, has overruled the prisons minister, Paul Boateng, in a Home Office clash over how to keep discipline inside youth jails, according to Whitehall papers leaked to the Guardian. Mr Boateng objected to a more liberal approach now being introduced of releasing early those juveniles who behaved well, saying it would lead to suggestions that the prison service was rewarding them with reduced sentences as the only way to get them to behave. The approach also brought a warning from the director-general of prisons, Martin Narey, about whether he could make it work. But Mr Straw rejected Mr Boateng's criticism and backed demands from Lord Warner, head of the youth justice board, for a more liberal use of the carrot rather than the stick. The options under the incentive scheme to enforce discipline among the more troublesome teenagers include rewarding good behaviour with early release, in-cell television and allowing them more trips home during their sentence. The clash between liberal and hardline approaches at the highest levels of the Home Office took place after prison governors complained that the new juvenile detention and training orders did not give them the power to add extra days to a sentence for bad behaviour. A leaked letter from Mr Narey to Mr Straw of February 12 makes clear that the home secretary rejected the option of new legislation to restore the punishment power of governors for juveniles under 18. \"In consideration of this I wanted to be open about how I will be encouraging governors to use the incentive of early release to encourage good order. You will remember that at a recent bilateral Paul Boateng expressed some concern about that,\" Mr Narey wrote, going on to make clear that he recognised some of the prison minister's concerns. He said most young offenders' institutions were coping well, but there was a problem in three jails where the over 18s, who could be punished with extra days, were held alongside the under 18s, who could not. Mr Narey also said the scheme was in danger of undermining the anti-drugs policy, which has so far proved successful because a positive drug test inevitably led to extra days on the sentence. \"But a juvenile who tests positive for drugs can have no such sanction imposed.\" He said nothing could be done about teenage offenders who smashed up their cells. If governors reported the matter to police, the courts had no custodial sanction because \"the maximum available sentence for criminal damage under \u00a35,000 is a three month period in custody, and the detention and training order [DTO] is a minimum of four months. \"We are doing everything we can to manage this and trying to make the system work. I think we can. But you need to know that to do so I am encouraging governors to exploit the ability of governors to release juveniles early from the custodial part of the DTO if they have made good progress with their sentence plan. \"In other words I am saying that I think we can manage without the stick if we can make reasonably liberal use of the carrot. \"We have no intention of making early release routine. But I recognise Paul's concern that its frequent use might lead to suggestions that we were having to reward young hooligans with reduced sentences as the only means of getting them to behave.\" The chief inspector of prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham, warned this month that the ban on governors adding extra punishment days on the end of the new sentences had seen some teenage offenders assaulting staff and smashing their cells with impunity, and violence was a growing problem in the youth jails.",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister, Tony Blair, today promised faith-based voluntary organisations a bigger role in the delivery of public services - but insisted that they would not wholly replace state provision. In a speech to the Christian Socialist Movement in London, Mr Blair praised the \"unique contribution\" of churches and faith groups in helping deliver \"speedily and effectively\" a range of services from health to regeneration. But he emphasised that the state would not jettison its \"obligations\" to provide public services, nor would it allow the transfer provision of services to the voluntary sector without the support of local communities. The prime minister's approach was noticeably less enthusiastic than that of Conservative leader William Hague's who last year proposed to \"denationalise compassion\" and give charities a bigger role in the provision of public services. Mr Blair told the conference that the role of faith groups working in partnership with central and local government was \"legitimate and important\", and that ministers were keen to take forward such partnerships \"wherever we can\". He added: \"Where you have the desire and ability to play a greater role, with the support of your communities, we want to see you do so. But I emphasize, we want you as partners, not substitutes.\" He said it was \"misguided and outdated\" to suggest that there was a straight choice between voluntary activity and state activity because the two should go together. \"And where the two do go together - the government fully recognising its obligations, looking to the voluntary sector as partner not substitute - the impact is far greater than government acting on its own. \"We see this in countless charities, schools, health projects, youth work, provision for the elderly, the homeless, work with offenders and ex-offenders, local regeneration schemes and many other social activities.\" Mr Blair launched Experience Corps, a national organisation which will work in partnership with public and voluntary sector bodies to promoting volunteering by the over-50s at local level. Experience Corps will be chaired by Sally Greengross, the former chief executive of Age Concern. He promised to test drive projects with local regeneration partnerships to see how obstacles to faith community involvement can be overcome in practice. Mr Hague told the Charities Aid Foundation in October 2000 that \"We must role back the frontiers of the state and allow independent groups and charities the scope to play a bigger role in tackling our social ills. \"It is time to denationalise compassion and create a genuine partnership between government and charities.",

It will add to the torment that 15-year-old girls already feel [about their weight],\" said Ms Jowell. She said her opinion was \"personal\" not a government line. In one feature about Friends star Jennifer Aniston, readers are given a diet to help them get from size 12 to size 6. Last year Ms Jowell chaired a \"body image summit\" with magazine editors to discuss whether images of skinny superwaifs in the media fuel anorexia. A Guide Association study found one-fifth of girls aged between 11 and 17 were on diets, while the Eating Disorders Association estimates that one in 100 young women suffers bulimia nervosa. But Celebrity Bodies editor Alison Hall vehemently denied the magazine will make women, and girls, starve themselves. \"It is not a teen mag.

She said sales of celebrity magazines increased by 142% last year and that, at any one time, 48% of 25 to 35-year-old women are on a diet.

Captain Cramer said a crater analysis was being conducted to try to determine where the shells came from. </p> <p>Mr Lawton had been based for the past several months in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo province, and earlier had been assigned to Istanbul, Turkey.

Commander Sokoli, a regional rebel commander, said the insurgents lacked the military capability to strike the village from their positions in Macedonia. A Macedonian military spokesman, Blagoja Markovski, said the shell that killed Lawton \"was not fired from the Macedonian side\" but that the army was conducting an investigation to be certain. UN officials said 10 shells landed in the village. Captain Cramer said a crater analysis was being conducted to try to determine where the shells came from. Mr Lawton had been based for the past several months in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo province, and earlier had been assigned to Istanbul, Turkey.

There is a severe shortage of midwives; two out of three maternity units are understaffed and London hospitals in particular have problems with recruitment. </p> <p>Last week, a survey of 2,000 recent mothers by the online magazine <a href=\"http://www.motherandbaby.co.uk\">motherandbaby</a> revealed that most were dissatisfied with the care they received, less than half would be happy to return to the same hospital due to lack of support, and half said they received poor post-natal care at home. Only 4% had the same midwife for antenatal appointments and the birth. \"Chronically overstretched maternity staff simply don't have the time to provide the sort of quality care pregnant women expect,\" says Sarah Stone, editor of motherandbaby. \"Many women feel as if they have gone through a conveyor-belt birth experience.\" </p> <p>My experience in the labour ward was exemplary. But the moment I was wheeled out of the delivery room and into the packed post-natal ward, it was as if I was being taken from a place where I was the centre of attention to a place where I had to be processed and moved on. The conveyor belt had begun to roll. </p> <p>It began with my inability to get breakfast. I had been in the ward for less than two hours and my legs were still dead from the epidural. I was awake (I had no choice - the fluorescent lights were on and the curtains around my bed drawn back) and very, very hungry. I had not eaten since breakfast the previous day. </p> <p>Breakfast was self-service. I watched as the trolley of catering- sized cereal boxes, sliced white bread and mini packets of Flora was wheeled up the centre of the ward. Legless, I called out from my metal-barred bed, \"Can I have some cornflakes please?\" My cries were drowned out by the baby opposite, who had an infection which wouldn't let him (or us) sleep. The trolley wheeled on past. My thirst was terrible. When a cleaner with a giant mop started wiping under my bed, I asked her if she could kindly get me some water. She took the empty plastic jug from my bedside cabinet, and trotted off to fill it. I never saw her or the jug again. </p> <p>I was later told it was all to do with the shift change, which coincided with breakfast in the morning and a busy visiting time in the evening. I learned to dread the shift change. If both babies started crying uncontrollably, if I developed a raging thirst while trying to breastfeed, if I needed to go to the toilet, and it happened to coincide with the shift change, then there was no help at hand. The midwives were swapping notes about us somewhere but could not be found on the ward. </p> <p>The continual change of staff was confusing. When one of my babies wouldn't breastfeed, I was told to feed him from a cup. The next day, a different midwife recommended a bottle or he would lose too much weight. The next day, another midwife said if I gave him a bottle he would never take the breast, so I had to starve him into submission. The following day, that decision was overturned by the next change of staff. </p> <p>Midwives themselves are not to blame (80% of those surveyed found them \"sympathetic and kind\"). They are given an unenviable number of roles to play in the postnatal ward. As well as carrying out rigorous medical checks of mother and child, they are expected to inform and educate. </p> <p>During my three days in hospital, I accumulated no less than six copies of the same full-colour glossy brochure on breastfeeding. Midwives are instructed to promote this method of feeding above all others. The only problem was, through no choice of my own, one of the twins was being bottlefed. It wasn't until two weeks later, when the health visitor (a former midwife who left because of the horrendous hours) came to my home, that I received my first bottle-feeding brochure. </p> <p>In black and white, it looked like something from the 50s, dated and unattractive. Yet it contained vital information on sterilisation of feeding equipment - information that I should have surely received far earlier. And not only me; despite the emphasis on \"breast is best\", the vast majority of women in my ward pulled out their ready-made bottles, handing their new-born over to a visiting grandmother. Half of the women in the survey said that, despite trying, breast-feeding didn't work out for them either. </p> <p>But perhaps, lying behind the disillusionment with maternity care, is a relationship that is inevitably and unavoidably one sided. You never forget the face or name of the woman who helped to deliver your child. Yet, within hours, she will have forgotten yours. It is, therefore, a relationship in which the mother is bound to feel abandoned. For us, it's a time of overpowering importance, when our emotions are at their most raw. For the midwife, it's just a job. </p> <p>In my ward, the conflict between the expectations of the women in the beds and those pacing the wards was acute. One midwife kept complaining about being tired from working 12-hour shifts. This is not an unreasonable complaint. But we mothers showed no sympathy. What was this midwife moaning on about, when we had been up all night, and would count three hours sleep at a time as a luxury? When the ward manager unplugged the patients' phone, saying staff didn't have time to keep answering it, mutters rippled through the mothers, stranded in bed by caesarean sections and catheters. Calls from family and friends were vital to us. It was as if we were being punished for not rising sooner from our post-natal rest. </p> <p>At home, the care was no less cursory. My GP practice's midwife no longer makes post-natal home visits; she has too many other clinics to cover. I saw three different midwives over two weeks. They came every four to five days, and it was only so frequently because the baby girl was a bit jaundiced. One weighed the babies with their clothes on; a week later, another weighed them naked, so comparing the weights became meaningless. Another asked me if I had been back for my hospital appointment yet, confusing me with someone else. It is hardly surprising. She had never met me before, and never would again. I was just another mother and baby to visit that day. </p> <p>\"Pressures on the health service mean there is little consistency in antenatal, birth and postnatal care, and some mums-to-be are lucky to see the same midwife twice,\" says Stone. \"The majority of pregnant women do not have the opportunity to build a trusting relationship with a midwife. Instead, most are filtered through a sea of different faces.\" </p> <p>Midwives are no happier than mothers with the system. On my post natal ward, they complained of impossibly long and erratic hours, making parenting impossible. Ironically, many midwives change profession when they have children. The government is promising to address this haemorrhaging with a recruitment drive. By 2004, the NHS plans to have 20,000 more nursing staff, although it is not clear how many of those will be midwives. </p> <p>If I did not have such strong, fond memories of my first child's birth, perhaps this time around would not seem such a cold, cynical encounter. But it does. I did not feel cared for; I felt as if having a baby was burden too much for the health service to bear. I know it can and has been otherwise. To restore a service to what it was almost a decade ago does not seem an exorbitant demand. After all, where better to get it right than from birth.</p>",

The same study found that only 44% of us bother to cast a quick look behind before we pull up and zip up. Which is rather silly. If we paid a little more attention to our crap, according to Dr Wendy Atkins, deputy director of the colo-rectal cancer unit at St Mark's hospital in London, we might just save our lives. </p> <p>Bowel cancer is the second biggest cancer killer in the UK, next only to lung cancer. In 1998, 17,000 people died of it.

What you're looking for is blood. Red blood, or clotted blood, not the little spots of blood you might get if you have piles after spending too much time reading on the bog in the first place. Your number twos are also likely to be \"more loose\", and you might find, says Atkins, that your toilet habits change. By which she means, if you get through the Brothers Karamazov in a week due to the number of times you need to visit the little room, it might also be a sign of something wrong downstairs. </p> <p>If you have both symptoms - blood in your stools and a touch of the runs - it's time to take it seriously, says Atkins, particularly if you are over 50. And particularly if you have a family history of the disease. And particularly - rather unfortunate, this - if you smoke. \"The chance of having a polyp (early stage tumour) is much more likely if you are a smoker,\" says Atkins. Which makes eminent sense, but rather pisses on one of life's great pleasures. </p> <p>Needless to say it is men who are especially useless at dealing with their crap. We are, according to Atkins, particularly bad at taking note of something murky in the bowl, hoping instead that it will just go away. It is that great British disease again: embarrassment. But if you see blood more than once, and don't know of anything else that might be causing it, get along to the GP. Better than dying for a crap, so to speak. </p> <p>Better still, once you have turned round to check that healthy little turd, why not throw the packet of fags down the loo as well.

Having briefly drifted on a legal high following my sound trouncing of Britain's most successful athlete (Sir Steven Redgrave) in the Murcia half marathon last week, I have come down to earth.

This ranges from what shoes I should be using for my training to what shampoo will make my hair right for running. I've also been told my favourite isotonic drink will not be available on the day. Instead there will be a rival brand handed out every five miles. Apparently I need to try this out before the big day, otherwise I could be sick. </p> <p>But it isn't all bad news. I have discovered a free way of relieving my body of bruises, aches and pains: the cold bath. After a long run, slip into the invigorating comfort of a completely chilled bath for 15 minutes. If you can manage not to grind your teeth into paste, good things will happen to your body. </p> <p>I am told the logic is this: when you run you get hot and blood rises to the skin surface in order to cool you down. That's why we all go red when exercising. But after a long run you need your blood to be in your muscles, breaking down lactic acid build-ups and helping to mend those minor tears. So to drive the blood there ultra quick and ensure it gets to work, immerse yourself in a cold bath. Blood is no longer needed on the surface and retreats. Another top tip.

If you can manage not to grind your teeth into paste, good things will happen to your body. I am told the logic is this: when you run you get hot and blood rises to the skin surface in order to cool you down. That's why we all go red when exercising. But after a long run you need your blood to be in your muscles, breaking down lactic acid build-ups and helping to mend those minor tears. So to drive the blood there ultra quick and ensure it gets to work, immerse yourself in a cold bath. Blood is no longer needed on the surface and retreats. Another top tip. Who said running wasn't fun?",

      "body": "<p>It starts with a cough. Nagging away for a couple of weeks. Almost overlooked, really, what with the cold weather and all this flu doing the rounds. The journey to work becomes a steady hack, hack, hack, a red-nosed and weary-boned bus-ride across town. It is only once the coughing gets louder, angrier, when the phlegm becomes blood-spattered, that the worry sets in. </p> <p>The diagnosis, when it comes, can be a surprising one: pneumonia. A disease - like diphtheria and consumption - that we tend to assume is a thing of the past; an illness of tragic Dickensian heroines. But pneumonia is very much still with us, and can be a devastating illness. Last week, the political journalist Tony Bevins died suddenly of viral pneumonia. A highly respected Fleet Street figure who had been working until recently at the Daily Express, Bevins was only 58. </p> <p>His death followed those of Frances Lincoln, a successful independent publisher, who succumbed to the illness last month aged 55, and of the artist Sarah Raphael, who died in January at the startlingly early age of 40, having also contracted pneumonia. Raphael's death was particularly shocking: she is reported to have felt ill in the morning, taken her children to school and died by the evening. </p> <p>\"It is still a common disease, and still a serious disease,\" says Dr John Macfarlane, a respiratory consultant at Nottingham city hospital and chair of the British Thoracic Society's pneumonia guidelines committee. There were 500 cases admitted to Nottinghams's two hospitals last year, he says, 5-10% of which were fatal. </p> <p>Pneumonia is a disease of the lungs, in which the alveoli (the air-containing spaces in the lungs) and the smaller bronchial tubes become filled with fluid. Symptoms are typically a high fever, lethargy and a difficulty in breathing, as breaths become shallow and painful. Sufferers may sweat profusely, lose their appetite or feel sick, they may appear confused or disorientated. And of course there is a cough - whooping up mucus, which is yellow, green, rust-coloured or bloody. The effects can be sudden - \"I fell like a small elm,\" said one sufferer - and the cough can be immensely painful. \"It was like scraping my lungs away,\" according to another. </p> <p>Two-thirds of pneumonia cases occur in the winter months. In January 1997, 11,000 people died from the disease in the UK - approximately double the usual number for that month, and the worst bout since 1965. The deaths in that year came on the back of a particularly severe winter flu epidemic, which provided ideal conditions for the infection to spread. </p> <p>That is because while anyone can fall ill to pneumonia, it is usually only life-threatening if the patient has been weakened or run down by another infection or condition. The disease strikes the elderly two or three times more often than the young. Patients enfeebled by lingering illness or a low immune system, or who have suffered a fall in the cold weather, are particularly at risk. A combination of the body's lowered defences to disease and the enclosed hospital environment, with its inhabitant bugs, allows the infection to flourish. Smokers and those with addictions such as alcoholism are also vulnerable, as are those with serious illnesses affecting the immune system, such as HIV, Hodgkin's disease, cancer, or leukaemia. </p> <p>Part of the problem is that there is more than one type of pneumonia. The most common is bacterial, which can be treated relatively easily with antibiotics. Viral pneumonia is generally less severe, but has no known cure. The fungal strain of the illness mainly affects those with long-term illnesses such as leukaemia. Macfarlane stresses that the illness, in one of its forms, can attack anyone: 40% of those admitted to hospital in Nottingham were of pre-retirement age. </p> <p>But a diagnosis of pneumonia need not be a cause for panic. Fatalities tend to be among elderly patients who might have suffered a stroke or have diabetes, says Macfarlane, and cases have fallen since the introduction of the influenza vaccine and the pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine, which is recommended for anyone with lung or heart problems. \"Of all the cases of pneumonia which occur annually, about 80% can be treated adequately in the community by a GP, with antibiotics. Only about one in five cases requires hospitalisation.\" </p> <p>The important thing to remember, he says, is to try to get regular exercise. Elderly patients often find that their lungs become congested from constant bed rest, as pneumonia bacteria continue to multiply. High fluid intake is essential, and painkillers can ease a chest that has been weakened by endless bouts of coughing. Those deemed particularly at risk may consider having the pneumonia and flu vaccines, but, advises Macfarlane, it never hurts to reduce alcohol consumption, stop smoking, take it easy if you get run down and make sure you get enough sleep and exercise.</p>",

It is a good idea for you and your partner to have a health check with your GP before throwing away your contraception. It is wise to include a blood test to check that you are immune to rubella (vaccination in adolescence doesn't necessarily mean you are immune; if you're not, it is better to be revaccinated before pregnancy). </p> <p>Any pre-existing medical conditions should be stabilised. If you or you partner take any prescription drugs, you can check they're safe in pregnancy. Quit smoking, dump any drugs or excess alcohol intake and aim for a balanced diet with moderate chunks of exercise in the run-up to conception. Once you're ready, finish the packet of pills rather than abandoning it in the middle to avoid erratic vaginal bleeding. </p> <p>Start taking folic acid as soon as you come off the pill. Then you can go for it; your body returns to normal each pill-free week that you have between packets. Some women find their periods don't return immediately but they usually had irregular cycles prior to being on the pill. Fertility often takes time. The average couple takes up to a year to conceive.

      "bodyText": "Organic farmer Peter Kindersley today won permission to seek high court orders blocking the government's policy of slaughtering healthy animals to combat the foot-and-mouth crisis. In the first legal action of its kind, a judge ruled that Mr Kindersley, 59, a publishing entrepreneur, had \"an arguable case\" which should be heard as a matter of extreme urgency. Mr Justice Richards said the challenge should come in a full hearing set for Monday at 2pm. The multi-millionaire farmer's lawyers had argued that the policy adopted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of slaughtering animals which were \"only suspected of being infected\" or might have been exposed to the foot-and-mouth virus went too far and was unlawful under both European Community and domestic law.

      "body": "<p>The president of the National Farmers' Union today told Tony Blair that there are \"positive signs\" that the policy of mass slaughter to combat foot and mouth disease is working.</p> <p>Ben Gill met the prime minister at Downing Street for 90 minutes. Afterwards he told reporters: \"It is important to realise that yesterday, for the first time, more animals from infected farms were slaughtered than were actually reported. That's the first time that has been achieved and that is an important development.</p> <p>\"What we need to look at and will continue to look at in the next 24 hours is whether that policy needs augmenting with supplementary measures in Cumbria or any of the other regions. Those supplementary measures might include an element of vaccination.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile the Tory leader, William Hague, today accused the prime minister of putting the interests of the Labour party ahead of the country as British tourism and farming industries were being ravaged by foot and mouth disease.</p> <p>Speaking in North Yorkshire, which today suffered a further case of the disease, Mr Hague made his first public statement on the possible May 3 general election.</p> <p>He said: \"I would be concentrating on fighting this disease and not the election.\" Mr Hague accused the government of being \"behind the game\" in tackling the epidemic. \"For a long time the government have lacked the urgency and conviction they have needed on this,\" he said.</p> <p>The Tory leader was in North Yorkshire to see at first hand the massive impact the disease has had on rural businesses and tourism.</p> <p>Mr Hague spoke out after an opinion poll was published in the Times showing that the foot and mouth crisis has failed to significantly dent Labour's lead over the Conservatives. That might encourage Mr Blair to opt for his preferred date for a general election - May 3.</p> <p>The Mori survey showed Labour on 50% - unchanged since late February and the early days of the outbreak. The poll found that support for the Conservatives had firmed slightly - up one point, at 31%. The Liberal Democrats were unchanged on 14%.</p> <p>The ratings were in spite of the fact that 69% of those polled said they were dissatisfied with the government's handling of the crisis. Only 18% said they were satisfied.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth roundup</a><br></p> <p><b>More on the election and foot and mouth</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a><br></p> <p><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463602,00.html\">26.03.2001: Countrytown blues</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html  \">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464909,00.html\">29.03.2001: Blair clears way for May 3 poll</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464865,00.html\">29.03.2001: Limit on vaccination 'a slap in the face'</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464863,00.html\">29.03.2001: Hoon sees sheep arrive for slaughter</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464861,00.html\">29.03.2001: Farmers jam helpline asking for 700,000 animals to be killed </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464774,00.html\">29.03.2001, George Monbiot: Foot and mouth is a good thing</a></p> <p><b>Farmer's diary</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464259,00.html\">28.03.2001: On the farm</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guides</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>More on the countryside in crisis</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463746,00.html\">27.03.2001: Hard times</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive: foot and mouth in 1967</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463588,00.html\">28.11.1967, leader: indecision on foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463571,00.html\">18.11.1967: 'Slaughter must seem a cruel remedy'</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463578,00.html\"> 16.11.1967: Foot and mouth may cost agriculture more than \u00a312m</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463596,00.html\">11.11.1967: Emigrant flights to Australia stopped by foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463559,00.html\">01.11.1967: It is cheaper to kill than to prevent cattle disease</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html  \">Computerised image of the virus</a><br></p> <p><b>Cartoons</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464422,00.html\">Steve Bell on how pigs will fly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,463874,00.html\">Steve Bell on Hague going over the top</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681  \">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/\">BSE</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>NetNotes</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs -

      "bodyText": "The president of the National Farmers' Union today told Tony Blair that there are \"positive signs\" that the policy of mass slaughter to combat foot and mouth disease is working. Ben Gill met the prime minister at Downing Street for 90 minutes. Afterwards he told reporters: \"It is important to realise that yesterday, for the first time, more animals from infected farms were slaughtered than were actually reported. That's the first time that has been achieved and that is an important development. \"What we need to look at and will continue to look at in the next 24 hours is whether that policy needs augmenting with supplementary measures in Cumbria or any of the other regions. Those supplementary measures might include an element of vaccination.\" Meanwhile the Tory leader, William Hague, today accused the prime minister of putting the interests of the Labour party ahead of the country as British tourism and farming industries were being ravaged by foot and mouth disease. Speaking in North Yorkshire, which today suffered a further case of the disease, Mr Hague made his first public statement on the possible May 3 general election. He said: \"I would be concentrating on fighting this disease and not the election.\" Mr Hague accused the government of being \"behind the game\" in tackling the epidemic. \"For a long time the government have lacked the urgency and conviction they have needed on this,\" he said. The Tory leader was in North Yorkshire to see at first hand the massive impact the disease has had on rural businesses and tourism. Mr Hague spoke out after an opinion poll was published in the Times showing that the foot and mouth crisis has failed to significantly dent Labour's lead over the Conservatives. That might encourage Mr Blair to opt for his preferred date for a general election - May 3. The Mori survey showed Labour on 50% - unchanged since late February and the early days of the outbreak. The poll found that support for the Conservatives had firmed slightly - up one point, at 31%. The Liberal Democrats were unchanged on 14%. The ratings were in spite of the fact that 69% of those polled said they were dissatisfied with the government's handling of the crisis. Only 18% said they were satisfied.

SRH said in a trading statement that declining radio advertising revenues would hit first-half figures. Advertising income from its radio stations for the six months to March this year will be down 4% compared with the same period last year. Radio advertising makes up around half of the group's revenues, but SRH remained bullish about the market's long-term prospects. \"While the board is somewhat cautious regarding current trends in the UK advertising market, it believes the longer-term prospects for advertising, and radio advertising in particular, remain positive,\" the company said. Capital Radio, the UK's largest commercial radio operator, underlined the scale of the downturn last week when it cut full-year profit forecasts by 10% due to do.tcom and telecoms companies reining in their marketing budgets. The company's first-half revenues climbed 19% to \u00a340m, thanks to SRH's acquisition of Irish newspapers the Kilkenny People and Ireland on Sunday. SRH is under attack from Virgin Radio owner SMG, which has built a 27.7% stake in preparation for a hostile takeover bid. SRH executives are seeking alternative bidders and have appointed financial advisers to find the best deal. SMG is unable to launch a full bid for its rival under current cross-media ownership rules are relaxed, increasing speculation that DC Thomson, owner of the Beano and 10% shareholder, will make an offer. SRH hinted in its statement that the ongoing speculation over the company's future will be settled before its first-half results in two months' time. \"It is expected that a further announcement on this subject will be made in advance of publication of the group's interim results on 18 May 2001,\" the company said.",

Most of the defendants were among 21 people detained by police as they left the conference. They face jail terms of up to 30 years. The court adjourned the trial until June 21, ordering police to find videos of the conference.</p> <p>Ms Polattas was not at the conference. She is already in jail, serving 18 years for allegedly belonging to the Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK), the outlawed Kurdish rebel group that waged a 16-year war in southeast Turkey for greater autonomy for the country's estimated 12m Kurds. She denies being a member.</p> <p>Polattas's father is the one male defendant on trial, accused of slander for reading a message from his daughter to the conference.</p> <p>Polattas, arrested in 1999, says that she and her friend, Ceren Salmanoglu, then aged 16, confessed to being PKK members only after they were beaten, sprayed with freezing water and raped with a truncheon during eight days of interrogation. Salmanoglu was sentenced to 21 years. Polattas and the other defendants at the conference were the first women to speak out about police rape. Women rarely talk of their ordeal, afraid they will worsen their situation by violating laws that restrict freedom of expression when it comes to the honour and reputation of Turkey's security forces.</p> <p>Ms Polattas's trial highlights Turkey's difficult struggle to clean up its human rights record as it prepares for European Union membership. Two days before the trial began, Ankara published a report promising reforms to end torture. The document also commits Turkey to review laws that restrict freedom of expression.</p> <p>\"Two days ago [Turkey] promised human rights for all. Don't I have that right?\" Sultan Secik, one of Ms Polattas's co-defendants, asked the court. The eight police officers Secik accuses of raping her are currently on trial.</p> <p>International human rights groups have condemned the trial. Amnesty International said it had \"called on the Turkish authorities to drop the charges against these women's rights activists who are guilty only of peacefully expressing their views\".</p> <p>Turkey admits that torture occurs, but says it is not systematic. It has promised to crack down on offenders. But, while members of the security forces are being prosecuted, they are often acquitted in court. The five officers accused of raping Nazli Top, another of Ms Polattas's co-defendants, were cleared. The Observer</p>",

Polattas, arrested in 1999, says that she and her friend, Ceren Salmanoglu, then aged 16, confessed to being PKK members only after they were beaten, sprayed with freezing water and raped with a truncheon during eight days of interrogation. Salmanoglu was sentenced to 21 years. Polattas and the other defendants at the conference were the first women to speak out about police rape. Women rarely talk of their ordeal, afraid they will worsen their situation by violating laws that restrict freedom of expression when it comes to the honour and reputation of Turkey's security forces. Ms Polattas's trial highlights Turkey's difficult struggle to clean up its human rights record as it prepares for European Union membership. Two days before the trial began, Ankara published a report promising reforms to end torture. The document also commits Turkey to review laws that restrict freedom of expression. \"Two days ago [Turkey] promised human rights for all. Don't I have that right?\" Sultan Secik, one of Ms Polattas's co-defendants, asked the court. The eight police officers Secik accuses of raping her are currently on trial. International human rights groups have condemned the trial. Amnesty International said it had \"called on the Turkish authorities to drop the charges against these women's rights activists who are guilty only of peacefully expressing their views\". Turkey admits that torture occurs, but says it is not systematic. It has promised to crack down on offenders. But, while members of the security forces are being prosecuted, they are often acquitted in court. The five officers accused of raping Nazli Top, another of Ms Polattas's co-defendants, were cleared.

      "body": "<p>The most comprehensive guide to British farming performance is provided by Deloitte &amp; Touche's Farming Results. \"Despite cutting costs and tightening their belts,\" the report for autumn 2000 concludes, \"farmers have suffered the lowest average incomes since our survey began 11 years ago.\" Several facts stand out, so unreasonable do they seem, and so shocking. \"In the last five years the net farm income of a 200-hectare family farm has plunged from around \u00a380,000 to just \u00a38,000 ... Those farmers who have expanded their operations dramatically in recent times ... cannot sustain profitability in the face of tumbling commodity prices.\"</p> <p>\"The bad news,\" says Mark Hill, the firm's partner in charge of the food and agriculture group, \"is that we predict small profits becoming losses in the coming year. This is due to a further fall in output prices and yield, plus rising costs of \u00a325 per hectare in fuel alone.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile the supermarkets are happy enough. Since 1995 Tesco's pre-tax profits have grown from \u00a3551m to \u00a3842m. Asda's have increased from \u00a3258m to \u00a3410m. Safeway's were \u00a3176m and are now \u00a3341m. In 1996 Somerfield made \u00a392m and in 1999 \u00a3208.5m. And Sainsbury's has gone from a 1995 profit of \u00a3809m to a 1999 figure of \u00a3888m.</p> <p>According to a recent three-volume report from the competition commission, the supermarkets share certain practices that are likely to accelerate their own profits at the expense of farmers and producers. This situation has been too little remarked on: despite complaints of a downturn in profits over the past five years, British supermarkets have enjoyed massive profits at a time when many of the people who produce the goods they sell have been living close to bankruptcy.</p> <p>There are three common perceptions about British supermarkets. The first is that the food sold in them is much more expensive than it is in their EU counterparts or in the US. Second, there's thought to be a great disparity between what is called the farm-gate price (what the farmer sells a product for) and the price of the item on the supermarket shelf. According to the competition commission, this \"was seen as evidence by some that grocery multiples were profiting from the crisis in the farming industry\". Third, many people believe that the growth of giant out-of-town supermarkets has been a major factor in the shrinking of town centres and the disappearance of small shops.</p> <p>There is some truth in each of these accusations. Food prices are on average 12-16% higher in the UK than in France, Germany and the Netherlands. (This trend is exaggerated by the strong pound.) \"In a competitive environment,\" the commission reports, \"we would expect most or all of the impact of various shocks to the farming industry to have fallen on farmers rather than on retailers; but the existence of buying power among some of the main parties has meant that the burden of cost increases in the supply chain has fallen disproportionately heavily on small suppliers such as farmers.\" Yet farmers' troubles are seen to be farmers' troubles.</p> <p>In market-speak the customer is God. Questions of environmental balance, social welfare, healthy farming culture and common fairness, are not the concern of the competition commission: it is interested only in the extent to which the main supermarkets infringe the customer's right to a good price. Between the lines of their assessments, however, a picture emerges of large-scale indifference to the wellbeing of the agriculture industry on the part of some supermarket chains.</p> <p>Again and again evidence is presented which makes clear the extent to which the suppliers are squeezed by the retailers. For example, supermarkets usually require suppliers to agree to \"various non-cost-related payments or discounts, sometimes retrospectively\"; impose charges and make changes to contractual agreements \"without adequate notice\"; and transfer risks \"unreasonably\" to the supplier.</p> <p>In other words, if a supermarket shows an interest in taking on a given product for its shelves, it will, by several routes, require payments from the producer in return for the favour. The overall UK market for groceries was worth around \u00a390bn in 1998. Between them, Asda, Morrisons, Safeway, Sainsbury's, Somerfield and Tesco account for 84% of the total. All the main supermarkets admit to \"requesting payments from suppliers as a condition of stocking and displaying their products\". All of them admitted requesting suppliers \"to make a payment for better positioning of products' in the stores. Many suppliers are familiar with what is known as the \"pay to play\" system, which requires them to pay fees to the supermarket chains for the privilege of having their products promoted within the store.</p> <p>The buying power of the British stores puts them in an unassailable position. Some suppliers, such as Peter and Carol Duncan whose Devon farm I visited, speak of a good working relationship with their main buyer. But most of the suppliers I spoke to expressed dismay at the tactics of the multiples. When I asked Tesco if it believed an unfair burden of costs was being passed back to its suppliers, it refused to comment.</p> <p>A very English drizzle was making a blur of Otford in Kent the day I visited. Hedges were loaded like wet sponges, the short grass squeaked underfoot, there was mud in the road and mud at the farm gate, with a cold whiteness in the sky that darkened quickly in the afternoon. Ian and Anne Carter were sitting in the drawing-room of their farmhouse. She is a JP, groomed to a fine point of civic order, wearing a blue suit with a poppy pinned to its lapel. She is well-spoken, opening up her world in good clear southern English, the language of the prep school and the Shipping Forecast, and her generosity seems to go perfectly with the rationale of the teacups. Ian stretched out his long legs like a teenager: he is likably comfortable with everything he knows and everything he doesn't know; he is right as rain and habitually nice. They both shake their heads.</p> <p>\"You need to have 2,500 acres to make farming work nowadays,\" he says. \"Not so long ago you could have 600 acres and second-hand equipment and send your kids to a good school and holiday in the South of France. That's all gone now.\"</p> <p>\"Absolutely,\" agrees Anne, \"there has been pressure from fertiliser companies to use certain fertilisers. There are too many sheep owing to these awful subsidies. The whole countryside has changed almost beyond recognition.\"</p> <p>Over the fireplace hangs a Constable painting: a portrait of one of Anne's ancestors. There is something darkly lively about the picture. For a while we all sat and stared into it. \"It's not at all famous,\" Anne says. \"All the famous ones are out there being admired.\"</p> <p>A British Legion-type couple came to lunch. \"It's funny the way things go,\" the man says, \"when you think of all those British companies that went to the wall. British manufacturing took such a hammering and now you see a whole way of living and working has disappeared.\"</p> <p>\"Do you think the land will eventually be nationalised and given to the National Trust?' his wife asks.</p> <p>\"You mean heritaged?\" someone else asks.</p> <p>\"Very interesting what's happened to The Archers,\" Anne says. \"This year Nigel, who has the big house, Lower Loxley, is involved in some sort of shooting gallery. They didn't have that before. The Archers has become less and less farming and more sex.\"</p> <p>We walked several miles over the fields. Anne spoke about a spiritual connection she felt with the countryside and a hope she retained in the balance of nature. When I walked with Ian he tried to give an account of why things had gone the way they had, a story of overproduction and subsidy distortion and diseased animals and the threat of bad seeds. It seemed less imposing that the land belonged to the Carters, and much more interesting, in an easy, uncomplicated way, that they belonged to the land thereabouts. They seemed to walk it knowingly.</p> <p>We stopped at the family chapel, dedicated to St Jude, in a building which dates from 1650. A book inside the chapel tells the story of the ownership of this piece of land - the lay ownership from 1066 to 1521, the removal of the house and the farm from a nobleman to one of the wives of Henry VIII.

However, the major labels appear more intent on shackling rogue websites such as Napster through multimillion-pound court cases. Meanwhile, Poptones today revealed it lost just over \u00a31m between June and December last year in its first results since floating in August. The label registered a turnover of just \u00a3175,000 and has \u00a31.4m left of the \u00a32.2m it raised from the flotation.

Labour's poll, taken at the weekend, showed it ahead on every policy except immigration and asylum. The party's already rock-solid lead on economic competence had risen.</p> <p>Election strategists who met in Downing Street yesterday believe that Mr Blair will face charges of insensitivity for the first two or three days of the campaign, but can ride out the charge.</p> <p>The environment minister, Michael Meacher, also gave the first public clue of how Labour will simultaneously fight an election and the spread of foot and mouth. He told MPs the 26-strong rural task force would continue to meet during the election and promised that any largesse to farmers would \"not be done in a political way\".</p> <p>The main block to the election juggernaut was advice from some senior Labour MPs that William Hague now privately favours a May 3 election in the belief that the crisis has knocked the sheen off Mr Blair.</p> <p>Despite the Tories' formal opposition to a May 3 poll, shadow cabinet members now believe that it provides the best chance to trim Labour's Commons majority to well below 100. One Tory MP said: \"At last we've got an issue to hang our hat on: competence and opportunism.\"</p> <p>The move to inoculate cattle, inititally in Devon and Cumbria, is expected to be announced today.</p> <p>Nick Brown, the minister of agriculture, who has in effect been sidelined by the prime minister this week, last night met the National Farmers Union leader, Ben Gill, to tell him that the vaccination programme must go ahead. Government sources said farmers' leaders increasingly recognised there was now no alternative to what was once described as the last resort.</p> <p>A European Union veterinary surgeons' meeting in Brussels yesterday gave approval for the vaccinations to start. No fresh domestic legislation is required. Adequate supplies of vaccination are said already to be available in Britain. Once vaccinated the cattle will eventually be slaughtered, but the move buys ministers time and helps create firebreaks.</p> <p>General Sir Mike Jackson, commander of British land forces and a Kosovo war veteran, personally oversaw the start of the mass slaughter in Cumbria. The animals were being buried in a mass grave. But the backlog of sheep waiting to be slaughtered in the county had risen to 140,000, leaving the government far off its target of reducing the wait from identification to slaughter to 24 hours. A total of 41 new cases were announced yesterday, taking the total nationwide to at least 716.</p> <p>The Ministry of Agriculture has now authorised 764,319 animals for slaughter, including 552,550 sheep. So far 481,909 of the total have been slaughtered with 282,410 animals still be culled.</p> <p>The prime minister admitted that it could not be said with certainty when the disease would end. Pressed by Mr Hague in the Commons, he conceded: \"When you say how can we be sure when the disease is going to end, the answer is we cannot be sure at the present time.\"</p> <p>In an attempt to reopen the countryside and save the ravaged rural tourist industry, ministers yesterday agreed revised guidelines for the opening of footpaths. Organisations such as the National Trust were pressed to reopen.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email  \">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth roundup</a><br></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: increase in cases</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,464617,00.html\">The issue explained: Vaccination</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained: Pigswill</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list  \">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br></p> <p><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463602,00.html\">26.03.2001: Countrytown blues</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html  \">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464340,00.html\">28.03.2001: New plan for firewall vaccination</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464312,00.html\">28.03.2001: Illegal meat trail leads to infected countries</a> <br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464283,00.html\">28.03.2001: 'They said nothing could be done'</a> <br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464337,00.html\">28.03.2001: Ministers failed to heed warnings, experts say</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463679,00.html\">27.03.2001, Matthew Engel: Fiddling facts while we burn</a></p> <p><b>Farmer's diary</b><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464259,00.html\">28.03.2001: On the farm</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guides</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>More on the countryside in crisis</b><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463746,00.html\">27.03.2001: Hard times</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive: foot and mouth in 1967</b><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463588,00.html\">28.11.1967, leader: indecision on foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463571,00.html\">18.11.1967: 'Slaughter must seem a cruel remedy'</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463578,00.html\"> 16.11.1967: Foot and mouth may cost agriculture more than \u00a312m</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463596,00.html\">11.11.1967: Emigrant flights to Australia stopped by foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463559,00.html\">01.11.1967: It is cheaper to kill than to prevent cattle disease</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html  \">Computerised image of the virus</a><br></p> <p><b>Cartoons</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464422,00.html  \">Steve Bell on how pigs will fly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,463874,00.html  \">Steve Bell on Hague going over the top</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681  \">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/  \">BSE</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html  \">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>NetNotes</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs -

Mr Blair, determined to give the impression that the government will soon have the crisis under control, hopes to see more than 700,000 animals slaughtered by the weekend, with 50 burial sites identified. Labour MPs expect him to go to Buckingham Palace next week after officials told them at a private meeting that the party's polling showed it had a 16-point lead over the Tories. Labour's poll, taken at the weekend, showed it ahead on every policy except immigration and asylum. The party's already rock-solid lead on economic competence had risen. Election strategists who met in Downing Street yesterday believe that Mr Blair will face charges of insensitivity for the first two or three days of the campaign, but can ride out the charge. The environment minister, Michael Meacher, also gave the first public clue of how Labour will simultaneously fight an election and the spread of foot and mouth. He told MPs the 26-strong rural task force would continue to meet during the election and promised that any largesse to farmers would \"not be done in a political way\". The main block to the election juggernaut was advice from some senior Labour MPs that William Hague now privately favours a May 3 election in the belief that the crisis has knocked the sheen off Mr Blair. Despite the Tories' formal opposition to a May 3 poll, shadow cabinet members now believe that it provides the best chance to trim Labour's Commons majority to well below 100. One Tory MP said: \"At last we've got an issue to hang our hat on: competence and opportunism.\" The move to inoculate cattle, inititally in Devon and Cumbria, is expected to be announced today. Nick Brown, the minister of agriculture, who has in effect been sidelined by the prime minister this week, last night met the National Farmers Union leader, Ben Gill, to tell him that the vaccination programme must go ahead. Government sources said farmers' leaders increasingly recognised there was now no alternative to what was once described as the last resort. A European Union veterinary surgeons' meeting in Brussels yesterday gave approval for the vaccinations to start. No fresh domestic legislation is required. Adequate supplies of vaccination are said already to be available in Britain. Once vaccinated the cattle will eventually be slaughtered, but the move buys ministers time and helps create firebreaks. General Sir Mike Jackson, commander of British land forces and a Kosovo war veteran, personally oversaw the start of the mass slaughter in Cumbria. The animals were being buried in a mass grave. But the backlog of sheep waiting to be slaughtered in the county had risen to 140,000, leaving the government far off its target of reducing the wait from identification to slaughter to 24 hours. A total of 41 new cases were announced yesterday, taking the total nationwide to at least 716. The Ministry of Agriculture has now authorised 764,319 animals for slaughter, including 552,550 sheep. So far 481,909 of the total have been slaughtered with 282,410 animals still be culled. The prime minister admitted that it could not be said with certainty when the disease would end. Pressed by Mr Hague in the Commons, he conceded: \"When you say how can we be sure when the disease is going to end, the answer is we cannot be sure at the present time.\" In an attempt to reopen the countryside and save the ravaged rural tourist industry, ministers yesterday agreed revised guidelines for the opening of footpaths. Organisations such as the National Trust were pressed to reopen. Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth roundup What's going on?

The smarmy politician, like the wheeler-dealer at the centre of squalor in the Labour party in Leicester East, momentarily becomes less significant than the junior minister at the Foreign Office, whose performance in his job is termed \"deeply regrettable\" by the Commons select committee on foreign affairs. But this time the charge is not justified. The Tories are calling it the most devastating attack ever made by a committee on a serving minister. It helpfully guides us, instead, towards three misperceptions about Labour's conduct of foreign policy. Let us get them out of the way, in ascending order of importance, before the election.</p> <p>First, there does not need to be a junior minister with responsibility for the Balkans, and he does not need to go there. The job is as absurd as the committee's judgment is ritualistic. The MPs seared Vaz for his ignorance and his absence, as if there was anything he could do to affect a policy that is entirely out of his hands. The Balkans is big stuff, which Mr Cook has rightly taken under his personal control, with the prime minister close alongside. The whole of policy, moreover, is done collectively inside the European Union. For the committee to remark that the EU commissioner, Chris Patten, has been to the Balkans seven times while minister Vaz hasn't gone near the place is a reproach based on the premise that empty ceremonial remains at the heart of political accountability.</p> <p>Which perhaps is a mirror of the committee's own role. To the over-stretched officials and military people trying to make a useful difference in Kosovo and the rest of the region, the only thing more irritating than a visit from a token British minister was surely the collective descent upon them, requiring to be watered and chaperoned, of a parliamentary committee whose subsequent report throws little more light on Balkans policy than many journalists have done before. The luckless Vaz, with his meaningless Balkan label, got caught up in the committee's own empty vanities.</p> <p>Second, though, his proper role as minister for Europe has been misconceived in a different way. This is not his fault, nor parliament's, but the government's. Most countries have ministers with that title, and many of these make serious contributions to thinking about the EU. They are often politicians to be reckoned with. In both Germany and France, the Europe ministers have a standing that entitles them to be heard, with opinions that sometimes disagree with their superiors'.</p> <p>Mr Blair has got through Europe ministers at the rate of one a year. Literally no job in the whole of government has come closer to being treated as a trash-can. The one occupant with the qualifications to fill it, Joyce Quin, was quickly moved on. The government thus accumulates little collective memory, or cultural affinity, for the kind of networking that is second nature to European politicians. Even harder than getting ministers to go to the Balkans is interesting them in the much more useful function of attending informal European get-togethers. Not long ago, at the annual Bertelsmann Foundation conference in Berlin, attended by Chancellor Schr\u00f6der and President Prodi, and several foreign ministers, as well as a number of presidents from central Europe, the best Britain could field was a Conservative baroness. The government voice for the British interest simply wasn't heard.</p> <p>This is a habitual British pattern, probably worse under Labour than the Tories. Since Peter Mandelson left office, there hasn't been a single leading Labour figure willing to do anything abroad which his department doesn't tell him he has to do. We need a Europe minister liberated to take the task of intelligent networking seriously, something Blair and Cook, in thrall to hierarchies of control, do not encourage. That person Keith Vaz will never be.</p> <p>Third, though, Cook has become on the whole an excellent foreign secretary. His low reputation with his political enemies and several newspapers is the biggest misperception at the end of these four years, owing a lot to the kind of vicious, personalised triviality which can endure so much longer here than in more mature societies.</p> <p>Apart from the major misfortune in his private life, Cook made one calamitous error at the start of his term, which was to promise an ethical dimension to his foreign policy in terms that have led to him being ethically faulted ever since. It was an honourable but half-baked claim, hoisting to prominence the false assumption that his predecessors had always been unethical and carrying the implication that he, a principled foreign secretary, would address the harshness of the world from a more elevated position. With the exception of a slight improvement in the European rules for arms sales, this he has naturally failed to do.</p> <p>But he is now admired in quarters we seldom hear about. The Foreign Office itself, many of whose top people detested his posturing at the start, has succumbed to his intellectual swiftness. Some officials still reflect bitterly on the responsibility which, as they see it, he failed to take for the Sandline affair in Sierra Leone, instead dumping them in the dirt. But his thorough grasp of many issues now overshadows his notorious reluctance to carry half-a-dozen red boxes home at night.</p> <p>He has likewise made friends in the European Union. For two years, he took no interest in the EU and made little impact on British policy there. Now he is an important player. When Mr Blair had to leave last week's Stockholm summit early, he could rely not only on Cook playing the British hand as he would have done but - a privilege not granted to many foreign ministers - on the Schr\u00f6ders and Chiracs accepting him at the table without demur. The friends of Mr Blair now say the leader cannot do without his foreign secretary. Of all top ministers, he has the closest, least troubled working relationship of any with the prime minister.</p> <p>Though he, too, was tritely criticised by the select committee for not visiting the Balkans, it is there, in his own eyes, that he has earned the greatest credit. His role was less spectacular than Joschka Fischer's. He didn't, like the German foreign minister, put his political life on the line to persuade his party of the case for defending Kosovo against ethnic purging by the Serbs. But alongside Blair, from a different wing of old Labour, he can take some credit for the removal of Slobodan Milosevic from power. In the scales that measure ethical foreign policy with a political purpose, this weighs in as a not inconsiderable item.</p> <p>After the election, I think Keith Vaz will no longer be minister for Europe, or the Balkans.

      "body": "<p>Last week a friend working in Kenya explained Britain's foot and mouth policy to a Maasai cattle herder. The nomad found our approach horrifying and hilarious in equal measure. His first objection was that all cattle belong to the Maasai, and no one had asked their permission. Then he wanted to know why Britain found it so hard to suppress a disease which the Maasai had learnt to control generations ago. When my friend explained that we were hoping to start selling our meat abroad once more, he was mystified: \"Why on earth would you want to do that?\" he asked. This is a good question, which we in Britain have so far failed to ask, let alone to answer.</p> <p>Yesterday, the Times suggested that our meat exports are worth \"up to \u00a31bn a year\". As usual, the paper of record seems to be making it up as it goes along. The Ministry of Agriculture's figures for last year show that we exported \u00a3310m worth of cattle, pigs and sheep to the European Union, and next to nothing elsewhere. Interestingly, this figure represents a decline of 39% from 1999. If this trend continues, our exports will dwindle to zero in three years' time. But it won't continue. Foot and mouth, for most foreign buyers, is the final straw, confirming their well-founded suspicion that our farming is unsafe. There is no guarantee that exports will resume at all when the UK is declared free from disease.</p> <p>Most of our livestock sales, moreover, are subsidised, by both headage and export payments. The truckers who drive them around are also state assisted, as their fuel and road taxes now pay only some 80% of the costs they impose on the Exchequer. Livestock sales, in other words, are likely to cost the country more than they make.</p> <p>So parts of the countryside have been declared off limits, the tourist industry has been all but obliterated, rare breeds have been slaughtered and hundreds of businesses have been closed to protect an industry which is worth not \u00a31bn a year, not \u00a3570m as ministers have claimed, not even the \u00a3310m that Maff figures show, but, in all probability, less than nothing.</p> <p>Surely then, there must be other reasons for the government's declaration of war with Britain's sheep? One compelling argument is that Europe insists we stamp out the disease. But the European rules - which arose, anyway, from the British insistence on curtailing foot and mouth through mass slaughter - are designed to protect trade between member states. Were we to abandon our fantasy animal exports, then the requirement would become obsolete.</p> <p>Foot and mouth disease does have implications for animal welfare. In extreme cases, livestock suffer gravely from the lesions on their mouths and feet. But we can put down animals in this condition without having to slaughter the entire herd, let alone the healthy stock on surrounding farms. Indeed, one of the many idiocies of the mass slaughter programme is that animals in distress are reached no faster than animals which aren't suffering at all: it prolongs pain, rather than relieving it. The selective culling of badly infected stock, moreover, is likely to lead to an improvement in disease resistance, which many of our over-developed new breeds are now woefully lacking. Any suffering caused by foot and mouth would surely be offset by terminating the cruel and unnecessary live transport of animals to other countries.</p> <p>There is no doubt that foot and mouth will also lead to reduced yields of milk and meat, but it's hard to understand why this should be considered a problem. Thanks to overproduction, the EU has introduced a quota system which ensures that every time we buy a pint of milk, we have to pay two pence over the market price.</p> <p>The benefits of endemic foot and mouth, by contrast, must surely be obvious. It would encourage farmers to develop local markets for their produce, which is the only strategy which makes both economic and environmental sense. It would reduce the number of lorries on the roads. It would persuade breeders to phase out strains with poor resistance to disease and inherent welfare problems, and return to hardier types which don't require such intensive management.</p> <p>So the government's decision to start vaccinating livestock should be opposed, on the grounds that it might eliminate foot and mouth from Britain. The ministry should continue to spread the disease around as rapidly as possible, by pursuing a slaughter programme it doesn't have the capacity to implement, leaving piles of rotting animals strewn around the countryside, then setting fire to them so that the virus is lifted into the jetstream and widely dispersed. If the vaccination programme is successful, then, as an urgent strategic priority, the government should reinfect the country forthwith.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: increase in cases</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,464617,00.html\">The issue explained: Vaccination</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained: Pigswill</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list  \">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br></p> <p><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463602,00.html\">26.03.2001: Countrytown blues</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html  \">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464340,00.html\">28.03.2001: New plan for firewall vaccination</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464312,00.html\">28.03.2001: Illegal meat trail leads to infected countries</a> <br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464283,00.html\">28.03.2001: 'They said nothing could be done'</a> <br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464337,00.html\">28.03.2001: Ministers failed to heed warnings, experts say</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463679,00.html\">27.03.2001, Matthew Engel: Fiddling facts while we burn</a></p> <p><b>Farmer's diary</b><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464259,00.html\">28.03.2001: On the farm</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guides</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>More on the countryside in crisis</b><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463746,00.html\">27.03.2001: Hard times</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive: foot and mouth in 1967</b><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463588,00.html\">28.11.1967, leader: indecision on foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463571,00.html\">18.11.1967: 'Slaughter must seem a cruel remedy'</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463578,00.html\"> 16.11.1967: Foot and mouth may cost agriculture more than \u00a312m</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463596,00.html\">11.11.1967: Emigrant flights to Australia stopped by foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463559,00.html\">01.11.1967: It is cheaper to kill than to prevent cattle disease</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html  \">Computerised image of the virus</a><br></p> <p><b>Cartoons</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464422,00.html  \">Steve Bell on how pigs will fly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,463874,00.html  \">Steve Bell on Hague going over the top</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681  \">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/  \">BSE</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html  \">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>NetNotes</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs -

      "body": "<p>Nobody wanted to mention the \"E\" word during prime minister's questions. In particular, William Hague can't appear to be running from an election.</p> <p>Tony Blair wants it to seem that his choice of date will be made exclusively to benefit the national weal, and will have nothing whatever to do with cutting and running before the recession gets worse and before every animal in the country, including cute pet kittens and frolicsome puppies, has been shot, oh dear me, definitely not.</p> <p>So Mr Hague had to employ a kind of code. After dancing around the prime minister, so to speak, trying to imply that the rampaging plague was in some way Mr Blair's fault without actually accusing him of feeding poisonous leftover number 37 with pak choi and egg fried rice to the pigs of Northumberland, he reached the point.</p> <p>\"The prime minister has promised to strain every sinew,\" he said. The present crisis required the use of all military resources \"and every ounce of the prime minister's care and attention\". In other words, this is no time for such frivolities as an election. Actually, \"strain every sinew\" is one of those dead metaphors you only ever hear politicians use. Brought back to life by a linguistic Frankenstein, it sounds to modern ears more like a cookery recipe. \"Plunge the sinews into boiling salted water and simmer for five minutes. Then drain, being careful to strain every one.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair, of course, was having none of it. \"We are doing everything we can to bring it under control,\" and he was wise to say that, since if he had appeared to give way on the election, almost the entire parliamentary Labour party would have called for his removal to the nearest abattoir. They really want that election, now.</p> <p>But nobody mentioned it. The tension in the chamber was almost unbearable. Most MPs are ready to snap. If they don't know about the poll, one way or the other, within 24 hours, some of them will be found naked under Westminster bridge, painted bright green, and claiming to hear messages from giant talking pigs.</p> <p>So there was a happy moment of relief half way through. Tim Loughton, the Tory MP for Worthing East, had a question on the order paper. Unfortunately for him, it came the day after he had described his leader as \"a baldy with a funny accent\".</p> <p>The public loves politicians who tell the truth, but politicians hate it. So even though Mr Loughton had gone on to say, \"in spite of these drawbacks, he is a miracle worker who could cure foot and mouth if he only had time to lay hands on five million sheep\" (or words to that effect), he was in big trouble.</p> <p>Labour MPs had passed the word around, and greeted his question with cheers and cries of \"more, more!\", before he even started.</p> <p>Mr Loughton had a choice. He could grin winsomely, chuckle, and make some self-deprecating remark, such as \"...speaking as someone with far too much hair and a stuck-up accent...\" Or he could be pompous.</p> <p>He chose pompous.</p> <p>\"While Labour members cheer...\" he said magnificently, rather like Sir Peter Tapsell waiting for the Hansard reporters to get out their stone and chisels so as to immortalise his words.</p> <p>The cheering redoubled. The Speaker called for order. Mr Loughton sat down. The cheering ebbed. Then he rose again, pomposity coursing in his veins like steroids through an Olympic athlete.</p> <p>\"While Labour members cheer...\" he went on, before reminding us of the state of play in the countryside.</p> <p>A Labour MP I know was sitting diagonally opposite the Tory leader, and reported that, ever so slightly, he blushed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nobody wanted to mention the \"E\" word during prime minister's questions. In particular, William Hague can't appear to be running from an election. Tony Blair wants it to seem that his choice of date will be made exclusively to benefit the national weal, and will have nothing whatever to do with cutting and running before the recession gets worse and before every animal in the country, including cute pet kittens and frolicsome puppies, has been shot, oh dear me, definitely not. So Mr Hague had to employ a kind of code. After dancing around the prime minister, so to speak, trying to imply that the rampaging plague was in some way Mr Blair's fault without actually accusing him of feeding poisonous leftover number 37 with pak choi and egg fried rice to the pigs of Northumberland, he reached the point. \"The prime minister has promised to strain every sinew,\" he said. The present crisis required the use of all military resources \"and every ounce of the prime minister's care and attention\". In other words, this is no time for such frivolities as an election. Actually, \"strain every sinew\" is one of those dead metaphors you only ever hear politicians use. Brought back to life by a linguistic Frankenstein, it sounds to modern ears more like a cookery recipe. \"Plunge the sinews into boiling salted water and simmer for five minutes. Then drain, being careful to strain every one.\" Mr Blair, of course, was having none of it. \"We are doing everything we can to bring it under control,\" and he was wise to say that, since if he had appeared to give way on the election, almost the entire parliamentary Labour party would have called for his removal to the nearest abattoir. They really want that election, now. But nobody mentioned it. The tension in the chamber was almost unbearable. Most MPs are ready to snap. If they don't know about the poll, one way or the other, within 24 hours, some of them will be found naked under Westminster bridge, painted bright green, and claiming to hear messages from giant talking pigs. So there was a happy moment of relief half way through. Tim Loughton, the Tory MP for Worthing East, had a question on the order paper. Unfortunately for him, it came the day after he had described his leader as \"a baldy with a funny accent\". The public loves politicians who tell the truth, but politicians hate it. So even though Mr Loughton had gone on to say, \"in spite of these drawbacks, he is a miracle worker who could cure foot and mouth if he only had time to lay hands on five million sheep\" (or words to that effect), he was in big trouble. Labour MPs had passed the word around, and greeted his question with cheers and cries of \"more, more!\", before he even started. Mr Loughton had a choice. He could grin winsomely, chuckle, and make some self-deprecating remark, such as \"...speaking as someone with far too much hair and a stuck-up accent...\" Or he could be pompous. He chose pompous. \"While Labour members cheer...\" he said magnificently, rather like Sir Peter Tapsell waiting for the Hansard reporters to get out their stone and chisels so as to immortalise his words. The cheering redoubled. The Speaker called for order. Mr Loughton sat down. The cheering ebbed. Then he rose again, pomposity coursing in his veins like steroids through an Olympic athlete. \"While Labour members cheer...\" he went on, before reminding us of the state of play in the countryside. A Labour MP I know was sitting diagonally opposite the Tory leader, and reported that, ever so slightly, he blushed.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer is the royal family of retail: a national institution in great need of modernising that has made a pretty shoddy job of it. While Prince Charles fiddles with record decks and Prince William impersonates Ali G, M&amp;S has confused its loyal customer base with new concepts such as the Autograph range. Today's announcement of cutbacks in its foreign operations is the latest shuffling of the pack by the ailing retailer. It now admits that it should never have launched overseas shops in the first place, as it distracted the group from concentrating on the parlous state of its UK stores. A combination of corporate arrogance and inability to recognise a changing high-street retail environment has torn a hole in the M&amp;S balance sheet. Its profits were \u00a31.1bn in 1998, but it failed to combat the rise of niche retailers - the Ted Bakers of this world - and profits last year sank to \u00a3418m. Overall sales in the past 11 months are down 6.3%. M&amp;S was slow to recognise that middle-market retailers were under threat from customers who were seeking either quality or value - not, ironically, the middle ground between those two. Customers wanted to look younger and trendier, but M&amp;S was seen as being firmly rooted in the world of carpet slippers and cardigans. M&amp;S chief executive, Luc Vandevelde, is trying to turn the unwieldy organisation round, and has hired Roger Holmes from rival group Kingfisher as his trouble shooter. There are myriad other reforms in the pipeline, including the launch of a new store format, the installation of in-store coffee shops and ditching the famous brand name in underperforming stores. M&amp;S has hired former Asda man George Davies to launch a new fashion range, which will not even carry the company brand, underlining the group's desperation to reinvent itself in the eyes of sceptical customers. However, Mr Vandevelde has admitted that the adult clothes range needs \"consistently better design\" - a worrying statement from the head of a company that relies on clothes sales. Perhaps the perpetual rebranding exercise will pay off, but there is a chance that by the time M&amp;S has worked out where it is going, most of its customers will have gone for good.

The Mirror Foot and mouth has also slipped from the front page but the same \"killing fields\" picture - taken by Evening Standard photographer Jeremy Selwyn - appears on pages four and five. The paper also claims 1.5m consumers have turned veggie. The Mail The preferred paper of the shires steps in to help the farmers. \"You've given us all hope\", it declares on its front page after readers raised \u00a33.4m to ease the farmers' plight. Financial Times Although the countryside economy is in deep crisis, foot and mouth has disappeared from the front page. Inside, the paper asserts tour operators may lose \u00a35bn as overseas visitors stay away. But emotions are not for business readers and the FT's lead foot and mouth story steers clear of talk of animals and death. Instead, it discusses how Tony Blair is tackling the crisis that has left him personally exposed. The Daily Telegraph Also a favourite in the shires. The aerial photograph of sheep queuing up to their deaths is given full prominence on the front page.

A bomb exploded at the premises of a political party led by Mr Cavallo, appointed last week as Argentina's third economy minister in as many weeks - a man seen by Wall Street as a white knight but by much of the population as promising more hardship.</p> <p>\"We don't see the slightest chance that Cavallo's policies will bring relief to those who really need it,\" Hugo Moyano said at a gathering of his powerful CGT labour federation. \"But we do know that Cavallo's first measure was to confirm De la Rua as president,\" the trade union boss quipped.</p> <p>Yet a lot is now riding on Mr Cavallo, and not just in Argentina. The fear is that the country could become the new Thailand, where the rush to the exit by international investors in the summer of 1997 precipitated the financial crisis across Southeast Asia and beyond in 1997 and 1998. The Economist Intelligence Unit last week warned of a possible downgrade to its rating for Argentina, and with global stock markets in the middle of a prolonged nose dive and the world's biggest economy, the United States, standing on the brink of recession, the risk is that a collapse in Argentina could prove contagious.</p> <p>Latin American finance ministers have already expressed concern that the crisis in Latin America's second-biggest economy could scare off investors and push up their borrowing costs. \"It affects the credit ratings of the whole region,\" Peru's economy minister, Javier Silva Ruete, said at the close of last week's Inter-American Development Bank annual meeting. \"With Cavallo's experience, we trust he will be able to take adequate action to overcome Argentina's problems and avert contagion to our countries.\"</p> <p>Not everybody is so confident. Gerard Lyons, chief economist at Standard Chartered Bank, is compiling a league table of those countries' crash resistance. \"Argentina is currently in bottom position, he said. \"Contagion is a real concern.\"</p> <p>Argentina is by no means a carbon copy of Thailand or Indonesia in 1997. There, the problem was an excess of liquidity. Banks borrowed massively in dollars but lent in local currency, relying on the Thai baht maintaining its peg against the greenback. The Argentine peso is also pegged against the dollar, but at a one-for-one exchange rate that has kept the economy deep in the doldrums for years.</p> <p>As such, it is not just a case of the new finance minister announcing a package of austerity measures to choke off excess demand and put the economy back on the straight and narrow. Argentina has been in recession for nigh on three years. At 10%, real interest rates are crippling, unemployment is running at around 15%, prices are falling in the shops, living standards are declining. All this at a time when the rest of the world has been growing steadily.</p> <p>Yet Mr Cavallo's first act will not be to announce a Keynesian reflation programme involving cheaper money and increases in spending. Instead, he will have to try to ram a $3bn package of cuts through parliament. Why? Because Argentina has been the beneficiary of a massive support package from the International Monetary Fund, and the only way to keep the men from Washington on side is to stick to the tight exchange rate regime. Abandoning the dollar peg would make it far more expensive to finance Argentina's debt, and raise fears of a relapse into the years of hyper-inflation, which Mr Cavallo brought to an end in the first half of the 1990s.</p> <p>Argentina, in other words, is caught in the same dilemma as Britain was in 1992, when the weakness of the real economy was crying out for lower interest rates and a devaluation of sterling, but the government's commitment to the exchange rate mechanism deprived it of the flexibility it needed.</p> <p>So what happens now? The problem is that the economic crisis has sparked a political one. Attempts by Mr Cavallo's predecessor, Ricardo L\u00f3pez Murphy, to address the country's economic difficulties split the ruling coalition, and few politicians seem to have the appetite for the unpopularity that forcing through yet more austerity will almost certainly bring. Already the opposition Peronists have rejected calls for a national government, and unrest has spilled on to the streets.</p> <p>As the thousands of workers protesting against the government flooded the Plaza de Mayo and marched through the country's other main cities, blocking avenues and attacking public buildings, university students in Buenos Aires brought their desks and benches out of the lecture halls and held classes on the city's main avenues, creating traffic chaos throughout the week.</p> <p>\"He's not going to last,\" said 46-year-old architect Mariano G\u00f3mez, \"one man alone is not enough to fix this situation.\" Businesswoman Cora Iriart, walking past students holding a class on the wide avenue in front of the law faculty, agreed. \"Can Cavallo pull off this miracle? I don't think so. He's a face from the past.\"</p> <p>If the social upheaval were not traumatic enough, more than 20 cases of foot-and-mouth disease were confirmed last week in the worst outbreak since the cattle-exporting country was declared free of the virus. This country of 36m people has also been hit by a high-profile money-laundering scandal.</p> <p>Yet, for all the difficulties, Mr Cavallo is seen as the one man with a chance of pulling off what would be little short of a miracle. His handling of the economy in the early 90s won him admirers at home and among the international investment community. What he would like to do is tough it out, hoping that a show of strength will keep the IMF and its $40bn of support on board.</p> <p>If that proves impossible, if he is unable to forge the political consensus necessary to get his painful measures through parliament, he has only three options: devaluation, dollarisation or default. None appeals. Devaluation might allow the domestic economy breathing space but would make paying Argentina's debt more expensive and wreck Mr Cavallo's own credibility. Dollarisation would tie Argentina's policy to that of the US when the Americans are struggling to keep their own house in order. In the last resort, default is preferable to a prolonged economic slump, but it would blow the country's credit rating out of the water and scare off foreign investors.</p> <p>It could also prompt holders of emerging market debt to rush for the exit. When panic sets in, lenders are often inclined to lump countries into risk categories rather than consider them on an individual basis. If Argentina goes, Brazil - where interest rates were raised to defend the real last week - will be next in the spotlight, even though the country has recovered impressively from its own financial crisis in early 1999.</p> <p>According to Mr Lyons, the likes of Indonesia and South Africa would feel a chill wind, too. \"At the moment, Argentina is rooted to the bottom of my league table,\" he said. \"But there are other strugglers.\"</p>",

Arthur Davidson, who sits on the board, was asked to call the meeting following accusations that Mr Desmond had interfered with editorial policy on the paper. According to reports in the New Stateman, a negative story about the BSkyB-owned interactive service Open was dropped on Mr Desmond's orders. A positive story about ONdigital and a negative story about PR guru Matthew Freud were also reportedly vetoed by the paper's bosses. Sunday Express editor Michael Pilgrim was not available for comment, but it is thought he requested a meeting with the board following a furious memo from the Express's veteran investigative reporter Michael Gillard. In his memo, Mr Gillard asked whether there was a place for investigative business reporting at the paper under Mr Desmond. The board, which comprises QC Mr Davidson, former Mail on Sunday editor Jonathan Holborow and Louise Chase, was set up by Mr Desmond after he bought the newspapers to deflect charges that he was not fit to run a national newspaper. The board was slammed as a \"figleaf\" for Mr Desmond. Two weeks ago at an NUJ meeting in Ludgate House, it emerged that they had not yet sat since their appointment. But the union has expressed concern that the editorial board will not have enough independent clout to address the problem without outside scrutity.

      "bodyText": "Why is there another strike? The strike is by 7,500 members of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport workers (RMT), who claim safety will be compromised and jobs affected under the controversial government plans to run the tube by a public-private partnership (PPP). London Underground, on the other hand, claims the strike is unnecessary and has branded the union \"impossible\" to negotiate with. What is the effect of the strike? Those striking include signal workers and station staff who walked out at 8pm last night, leading to travel chaos across the capital. The strike caused a virtual wipeout of tube trains in central London during this morning's rush hour. Until 8am, fewer than 30 of the usual 500 trains were running, and there were no services at all on many lines in the centre of the capital. This, inevitably, led to overcrowding on overland trains and buses. The strike is scheduled to end at 8pm tonight, but problems are anticipated throughout the evening. Although members of the train drivers' union, Aslef, were not involved in today's action, many were expected to refuse to cross RMT picket lines, thus adding to the disruption. How will the dispute be resolved? A high-court battle to settle the tube funding and management row is looking increasingly likely. Last night it emerged that, were a case to be brought, it would probably begin just days ahead of the possible May 3 general election. A meeting on Thursday, billed as the \"final meeting\", between the London transport commissioner, Bob Kiley, and the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, failed to produce an agreement. Both sides have accused each other of reneging on agreements. Lawyers for Transport for London (TfL), the capital's transport authority, are attempting to declare PPP illegal while the government seems determined to push it through. Unless a last-minute deal centred on unified management control (which will not see the break up of tube services, maintenance and infrastructure) is agreed, the court action will go ahead, a TfL spokesmen said. TfL lawyers believe that \"there is scope\" for a judicial review hearing to begin on or around April 30 and lawyers will argue that the government's plan risks human safety and is too expensive. Has the fight begun to get dirty? Yes. Mr Kiley has been playing the safety card and the government have now responded by questioning his own safety record, claiming that, when he finished as controller of the New York subway, its safety record was 40 times worse than the tube's. Furthermore, according to RMT, London Underground is preparing to sue them and to pursue criminal damages against individual activists. Has there been any progress on this saga? Not really, no. Tony Blair has closed ranks with John Prescott and Gordon Brown in their determination to force Mr Livingstone and Mr Kiley to \"knuckle down\" and work within the government's \u00a315bn blueprint for modernising London's underground system. They argue that PPP should have started almost a year ago. What is PPP? It is the Treasury's concoction of a public-private partnership that would split the tube into four sections.

The private sector would raise the funds and be reimbursed by the users of the lines, London Underground and the government. What are the objections to PPP? Mr Kiley, an American who has had success in rejuvenating similar underground networks in New York and Boston, has said that the proposed split responsibility is unsafe and that a \"unified management\" is crucial. He has an alternative proposal, centred on unified management. Mr Kiley would keep the basic structure of the tube in one piece and use private-sector bidders as long term contractors under his control. One way of doing this would be for him to have a 51% holding in the companies. However, the Treasury appears to have taken little interest in his ideas. One source said: \"We cannot allow him to interfere in the day to day running\". Mr Kiley claims that the Treasury's plan amounts to little more than privatisation. What is needed, he suggests, is simple government funding of the necessary investment in infrastructure, which he estimates at \u00a3500m-\u00a3700m a year. \"The 'fatal flaw' is simply that the public will own the system but not control it\", Mr Kiley says of PPP. What is the government's position? It is complicated by there being distinct two camps - the Treasury, which wants to push through PPP, and the Prescott camp, which is more open minded about alternatives and has some of Mr Blair's sympathies. Mr Kiley has painted a picture of Mr Brown, as \"the Wizard of Oz\", pulling the levers behind the scenes to control Mr Prescott, who is officially leading the talks. The cost of reorganising the tube system could amount to \u00a313bn over the next 15 years and the Treasury appears adamant that this should be kept out of public accounts, which an unmodified PPP plan does very neatly.

      "bodyText": "A sophisticated automatic train protection system to stop trains going through red signals must be in place on high-speed lines by 2008, a rail safety inquiry report recommended today. Until then, the network must make do with a train protection warning system (TPWS) that had \"serious shortcomings\", the report added. TPWS would not remove public concerns about the \"possibility of further catastrophic accidents\" said the report from the two men who chaired the public inquiries into the Southall and Paddington crashes. Nevertheless, Professor John Uff (the Southall chairman) and Lord Cullen (Paddington) recommended the current programme of fitting of TPWS at key rail junctions by 2004 continue. After that the two men want to see the introduction of a new automatic train protection (ATP) system - the European Train Control System (ETCS) - on British railways. The report recommended that all lines carrying trains above 100mph are fitted with ETCS by 2008. Also, no train travelling at more than 100mph can be in service after 2010 until it is protected by ETCS. In addition, all new trains should, if possible, be fitted with ETCS when they are built. A system authority should be set up to oversee and direct the fitting of the new system as this task could not be \"safely left to the industry in its fragmented state,\" said the report, which contained 39 recommendations. Today's report followed the Cullen-Uff inquiry into train protection systems and was a direct result of the 1997 Southall crash, which claimed seven lives, and the 1999 Paddington disaster in which 31 people died. In both cases, trains went through red signals before crashing and prompted calls for sophisticated ATP to be introduced network-wide immediately. Today's report said that TPWS would have prevented Paddington but not Southall. On TPWS, the report said: \"Its benefits are plainly limited and, despite the substantial expenditure that it represents, TPWS will still permit a proportion of ATP-preventable accidents to occur.\" The report pointed out that TPWS only automatically stops trains at speeds of less than 75mph. The joint chairmen said: \"After weighing the issues carefully, we are left with considerable reservations about the effectiveness of TPWS.\" Meanwhile, the number of signals passed at danger on the railways last month rose compared with the figure for February 2000, it was announced today. There were 42 instances of signals passed at danger (SPADs) in February 2001, compared with 38 in the same month last year, the Health and Safety executive reported. Of the 42 incidents last month, 21 were signals that had previously been passed at danger.

They're the ones hastily renting DVDs, desperate to find some use for their \u00a3300 console. </p> <p>After all, if flashy snowboarding (SSX) or simplistic third person shooting (Timesplitters) don't appeal, then watching DVDs is the best way to prevent dust settling on the stylish black machine. </p> <p>Thankfully this gaming drought has been sated, with the release of some interesting titles. The Metal Gear Solid 2 demo is now out, showing PS2 owners a potentially bright future, while Star Wars Starfighter is the sci-fi franchise's inaugural appearance on the console. </p> <p>Ostensibly a level-based space shooter, Starfighter offers more than the sum of its parts by mixing fluid controls with a real sense of narrative. Controlling one of three characters - rookie fighter pilot Rhys, female mercenary Vana and Nym the pirate - your aim is to battle the Trade Empire. This potentially unexciting premise is split into 14 missions and soon becomes engrossing; the initial lack of stormtroopers and Darth Vader gradually loses importance. Each of the three craft flies differently, with levels set on planets and in space, but the controls, which use both dualshock joysticks, are pleasingly intuitive. Graphically and sonically, Starfighter is outstanding, with crisp textures matched by the stirring Star Wars soundtrack. </p> <p>Unfortunately the game is short-lived, despite rewards for speedy finishes. Also, the linear nature means there is only one way to complete the levels, which you often fail to complete without knowing why. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Starfighter is a return to form for Lucasarts. Non-PS2 DVD owners should find the rental shop a bit quieter, too. (GH)</p> <p><strong> Darkstone</strong><br> Sony PlayStation \u00a39.99 Delphine Software/ Electonic Arts *** <br> When Darkstone was released for PC in mid-1999, it provoked extensive comparisons with Diablo, previously the most popular role-playing game (RPG). It fared pretty well: while the fundamentals of gameplay were similar - dungeon- crawling, gaining experience, returning to town to heal and shop - Darkstone introduced a neat new twist with the ability to play two characters at once. The tag-team format offered an entirely new tactical challenge, and this, combined with pretty graphics, witty dialogue and a well-crafted learning curve, turned Delphine's RPG into a minor hit. </p> <p>Goodness only knows how it took two years to re-code the game for PlayStation, but now, finally, it's back - and it's the same as ever. To be fair, one of the perils of porting RPGs to consoles is in converting the controls, and the programmers have done a pretty good job. They've even managed to incorporate the fully rotatable 3D view on the analogue stick, allowing the more co-ordinated to watch fights on the fly. Also impressive is the way the play area is still generated anew each play, although the very changeability of the map makes much of the game world a bit samey. </p> <p>Everything else about the game, though, is so two years ago. The plot concerns efforts to defeat an evil dragon (Draak) by locating and assembling the seven pieces of a powerful ancient artifact (the Time Orb). Yada, yada. You have four choices of class - warrior, wizard, thief or priest - who can cast spells and hit things with varying degrees of success. </p> <p>Yada. And the visuals haven't aged well. Once you've played RPGs like Baldur's Gate 2, with its complex plots, dozens of classes, hundreds of spells and player-controlled teams of up to six characters, the likes of Darkstone don't seem good enough for your bratty little brother. </p> <p>Still, if you're looking to wear out the PlayStation so you have an excuse to buy a PlayStation 2, this is a cheap and painless way of doing it. (AB)</p> <p> <strong> Hostile Waters</strong> </p> <p> PC \u00a334.99 Rage ****<br> This is a rare treat, a game that expertly combines two genres, albeit not quite resulting in a distinctive third. Whether your taste be real time strategy (Red Alert) or first person shooter (Quake) there's plenty here for you to get your teeth into. </p> <p>In play, Hostile Waters is very like the excellent Battlezone 2, allowing you to build up units slowly, gather resources and scout out the enemy, before jumping into the cockpit of any tank or chopper to deal out death personally. All of this is helped by an excellent interface, which encourages complex commands but with a couple of mouseclicks that never feel less than instinctive. </p> <p>Left to their own devices, units will aim and shoot far more accurately than a real player, making this one of those rare titles where you can rely on your wingmen not to charge into walls or wander blindly into ambushes. </p> <p>Admittedly, Hostile Waters is not a true RTS in that your \"base\" is an aircraft carrier, unable to move and woefully lacking in common sense. The addition of a few defensive turrets would have made protecting it a lot more satisfying; instead you only need a steady supply of scrap metal to keep producing more units. Not being able to build land structures also makes each level's tactics very similar, but the depth of the gameplay and design more than compensates. </p> <p>The graphics are stunning, bold and colourful with realistic weather conditions. Enemy units start off predictably Russian, before mutating into hybrid devices - part insect, part metal. All of this makes for a convincing story, with genuine surprises - such as the first time you come across a Boss level and have to demolish some massive spaceship piece by piece. </p> <p>In fact, the only thing preventing this getting the 5-star treatment is the fairly basic enemy artificial intelligence. Hostiles respond to alerts but only by moving to your last recorded position. Armed with a cloaking device and a long-range laser, a single chopper can decimate even the hardest bases. Nevertheless, if you play it less cautiously (the way you were meant to) there are weeks of quality gaming. Hostile? No, come on in, the water's lovely! (MAA)</p>",

      "bodyText": "Online loyalty points service Beenz.com is up for sale, becoming the latest casualty of the internet recession. The company, which operates an internet \"loyalty points\" service, initiated yet another round of redundancies, leaving the company with just 80 employees worldwide - down from 260 at its peak a year ago. A spokesman for the company refused to say how Beenz.com had managed to burn through \u00a356m in two years, nor give details of how much cash Beenz.com had left in the bank. \"The only thing I can add is that they are keeping their options open,\" said the spokesman. Beenz.com's board of directors has been looking at ways of restructuring the business since its troubles were first rumoured last November. Chief executive officer Charles Cohen told MediaGuardian.co.uk in December he was conducting a three-month review and would not rule out a strategic partnership with an offline company taking a stake in the business. In a statement today, Beenz.com said it was already \"in discussions with several potential strategic partners\". The latest round of job cuts have hit the London office the hardest, although the company will continue to run global networks from its London base.",

      "byline": "David Mitchell",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Services for people with learning disabilities in Scotland have taken a giant leap forward with plans to set up a Scottish development centre for learning disabilities.</p> <p>A consortium of 13 organisations, led by charity Enable, has been awarded \u00a31.5m over five years to develop the Glasgow-based centre, which will be up and running by September to offer advice, training and support to agencies, professionals and people with learning disabilities.</p> <p>But despite the jubilation over the centre's go-ahead, there is still widespread concern that not enough is being done to implement the Scottish executive's 10-year blueprint for services, unveiled last May, which originally suggested the centre.</p> <p>The strategic review, The Same as You?, set a deadline for closing all long-stay hospitals by 2005; proposed a change fund to help councils and health boards implement it, and promised direct payments to allow people to buy their own services by 2003.</p> <p>So far the executive has failed to produce an implementation plan; local authorities and health boards have had to wait for guidance on local partnership agreements, and there are fears the change fund will not be enough.</p> <p>Norman Dunning, director of Enable, said: \"The process has taken a lot longer than expected, but now at least we have got the centre, which is a start. The executive has been dragging its feet - it should have got this sorted out a lot quicker and produced an action plan.</p> <p>\"We are also disappointed at the size of the change fund - \u00a336m over three years - which seems wholly inadequate. It's being distributed to authorities as part of their general grant allocation, so there is no guarantee it will be spent on people with learning disabilities, let alone the review. It is absolutely crazy.\"</p> <p>As well as providing consultancy, training and advice, the new centre will gather information on needs and services; provide education materials; promote public education, and disseminate latest research. In line with the review, it will be user and carer-led, with at least half of its board of trustees made up of users or carers.</p> <p>Malcolm Matheson, director of consortium member Key Housing Association, which provides supported accommodation for 800 people with learning disabilities throughout Scotland, sees this as of crucial importance.</p> <p>\"As the policy was being developed, the people we support expressed a very clear view that the strategy and the centre should be fully inclusive and have people with learning disabilities and their carers at the heart. Our aim is to try and support people with learning disabilities to do that and become a driving force behind this initiative,\" he said.</p> <p>\"But the centre is not going to be the answer to everything and there is disappointment that the impetus for the review seems to have gone. The key players at the Scottish executive who worked on the strategy have been moved to other activities and the implementation is not as well resourced as it should be.\" James Hogg, professor of profound disabilities at Dundee University - one of four universities in the consortium - said the new centre would, for the first time, provide a focus for the activities of everyone working in the field.</p> <p>\"We hope to set up a wider group of universities in which anyone carrying out research can collaborate with us, providing an expert resource to draw on. But the executive needs to produce guidance on various aspects of implementing the review. The sooner we have that, the easier the task will be for people working at local level,\" he said.</p> <p>For Idem Lewis, who has a learning disability and is a tenants adviser for Key Housing, the centre means people with learning disabilities will be taking an active part in its running, whereas in the past it would have been professionals with little contact with service users.</p> <p>\"It is important to remember that when care in the community was launched in the early 1990s, the decision makers didn't think of how it was not just about putting people into houses, but about looking at communities and how people were discriminated against,\" he said.</p> <p>\"People have been neglected in the past. Hopefully, the centre will eventually change the way people work and help make society a lot better by leading on courses, research and public education. It will make a big difference.\"</p> <p>The executive said progress was being made and guidance had been issued to councils and health boards on local partnership agreements.</p> <p>\"We have also set out proposals in the long-term care bill for consultation on direct payments and, locally, agencies are making progress on hospital retractions, joint services and resourcing, improved advocacy and alternatives to traditional day services,\" said a spokeswoman.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Services for people with learning disabilities in Scotland have taken a giant leap forward with plans to set up a Scottish development centre for learning disabilities. A consortium of 13 organisations, led by charity Enable, has been awarded \u00a31.5m over five years to develop the Glasgow-based centre, which will be up and running by September to offer advice, training and support to agencies, professionals and people with learning disabilities. But despite the jubilation over the centre's go-ahead, there is still widespread concern that not enough is being done to implement the Scottish executive's 10-year blueprint for services, unveiled last May, which originally suggested the centre. The strategic review, The Same as You?, set a deadline for closing all long-stay hospitals by 2005; proposed a change fund to help councils and health boards implement it, and promised direct payments to allow people to buy their own services by 2003. So far the executive has failed to produce an implementation plan; local authorities and health boards have had to wait for guidance on local partnership agreements, and there are fears the change fund will not be enough. Norman Dunning, director of Enable, said: \"The process has taken a lot longer than expected, but now at least we have got the centre, which is a start. The executive has been dragging its feet - it should have got this sorted out a lot quicker and produced an action plan. \"We are also disappointed at the size of the change fund - \u00a336m over three years - which seems wholly inadequate. It's being distributed to authorities as part of their general grant allocation, so there is no guarantee it will be spent on people with learning disabilities, let alone the review. It is absolutely crazy.\" As well as providing consultancy, training and advice, the new centre will gather information on needs and services; provide education materials; promote public education, and disseminate latest research. In line with the review, it will be user and carer-led, with at least half of its board of trustees made up of users or carers. Malcolm Matheson, director of consortium member Key Housing Association, which provides supported accommodation for 800 people with learning disabilities throughout Scotland, sees this as of crucial importance. \"As the policy was being developed, the people we support expressed a very clear view that the strategy and the centre should be fully inclusive and have people with learning disabilities and their carers at the heart. Our aim is to try and support people with learning disabilities to do that and become a driving force behind this initiative,\" he said. \"But the centre is not going to be the answer to everything and there is disappointment that the impetus for the review seems to have gone. The key players at the Scottish executive who worked on the strategy have been moved to other activities and the implementation is not as well resourced as it should be.\" James Hogg, professor of profound disabilities at Dundee University - one of four universities in the consortium - said the new centre would, for the first time, provide a focus for the activities of everyone working in the field. \"We hope to set up a wider group of universities in which anyone carrying out research can collaborate with us, providing an expert resource to draw on. But the executive needs to produce guidance on various aspects of implementing the review. The sooner we have that, the easier the task will be for people working at local level,\" he said. For Idem Lewis, who has a learning disability and is a tenants adviser for Key Housing, the centre means people with learning disabilities will be taking an active part in its running, whereas in the past it would have been professionals with little contact with service users. \"It is important to remember that when care in the community was launched in the early 1990s, the decision makers didn't think of how it was not just about putting people into houses, but about looking at communities and how people were discriminated against,\" he said. \"People have been neglected in the past. Hopefully, the centre will eventually change the way people work and help make society a lot better by leading on courses, research and public education. It will make a big difference.\" The executive said progress was being made and guidance had been issued to councils and health boards on local partnership agreements. \"We have also set out proposals in the long-term care bill for consultation on direct payments and, locally, agencies are making progress on hospital retractions, joint services and resourcing, improved advocacy and alternatives to traditional day services,\" said a spokeswoman.",

      "bodyText": "Princess Margaret has suffered another minor stroke, Buckingham Palace said today. The Queen's younger sister was taken ill on Tuesday afternoon at Kensington Palace. She has remained at the palace where she is receiving nursing care, said a spokeswoman. Margaret, 70, suffered a suspected stroke just before Christmas at Sandringham, the Queen's Norfolk estate. She was treated at the private King Edward VII hospital in London after experiencing a severe loss of appetite. In 1998 she suffered her first stroke on the island of Mustique. A year later, Margaret, who normally lives at Kensington Palace, suffered serious burns to her legs and feet in an accident while on holiday on the Caribbean island. Margaret is said to have given up smoking after a part of her lung was removed in 1985. It is understood the princess has been visited by her children, Viscount Linley and Lady Sarah Chatto, during her recovery this week.

Now people are not so sure.</p> <p>This government of soothing soundbites is discovering that asinine spin when a crisis hits does not reassure. Farmers did not believe the government when they were told that the foot and mouth outbreak was under control. They were worried to death as the disease stalked ever closer to their farms. Steel workers at Llanwern do not believe that the government has created economic stability, as they line up to collect their P45s. Lorry drivers are not convinced that the government is on their side, seeing their businesses taxed and regulated to death.</p> <p>This cold, hard, wet, sometimes snow ridden, grey, miserable spring is proving to be Labour's spring of discontent. You could see it in the faces of the Cumbrian protesters when Tony Blair swept in by Jaguar four weeks after the foot and mouth disaster struck. You can see it in the faces of the hoteliers and leisure operators looking at blank booking diaries, ringing their bank managers anxiously to see how long they will tide them over. You can see it in the crushed looks of the dot.com brigade, whose year of fun is well and truly over.</p> <p>The government still tells us that the economy is fine. It has after all abolished boom and bust. When I warned that it could not abolish the trade cycle, I was told I was wrong. Now the trade cycle, like an unfriendly boomerang, is coming back to haunt them.

      "bodyText": "What a difference a month makes. Before the outbreak of foot and mouth, before the stock market crash, the government kept reciting, \"No more boom and bust\". Many believed it. Now people are not so sure. This government of soothing soundbites is discovering that asinine spin when a crisis hits does not reassure. Farmers did not believe the government when they were told that the foot and mouth outbreak was under control. They were worried to death as the disease stalked ever closer to their farms. Steel workers at Llanwern do not believe that the government has created economic stability, as they line up to collect their P45s. Lorry drivers are not convinced that the government is on their side, seeing their businesses taxed and regulated to death. This cold, hard, wet, sometimes snow ridden, grey, miserable spring is proving to be Labour's spring of discontent. You could see it in the faces of the Cumbrian protesters when Tony Blair swept in by Jaguar four weeks after the foot and mouth disaster struck. You can see it in the faces of the hoteliers and leisure operators looking at blank booking diaries, ringing their bank managers anxiously to see how long they will tide them over. You can see it in the crushed looks of the dot.com brigade, whose year of fun is well and truly over. The government still tells us that the economy is fine. It has after all abolished boom and bust. When I warned that it could not abolish the trade cycle, I was told I was wrong. Now the trade cycle, like an unfriendly boomerang, is coming back to haunt them. Soon the government will solemnly tell us that Britain is fine, but unfortunately the US under Mr Clinton (they will probably blame Mr Bush) did not succeed in abolishing boom and bust, so there will be some collateral damage over here. The truth is that this government has ensured that the bust will be bigger for more people in Britain than it need have been. It will be worse in the countryside.

It adds: \"Is this Labour's way of cutting the waiting list, by scaring people not to go to hospital?\"</p> <p>The election leaflets dealt a blow to the attempts by the Tory leadership to distance itself from the rightwing MP John Townend after he lavished praise on Powell's infamous 1968 \"rivers of blood\" warning. Mr Townend, 66, who is standing down as MP for Yorkshire East at the general election, sparked a storm of protest when he blamed \"coloured immigrants\" for changing British society.</p> <p>In a speech to his local association, Mr Townend said: \"Our homogeneous Anglo-Saxon society has been seriously undermined by the massive immigration, particularly coloured immigration, that has taken place since the war.

In my view the only way to deal with the problem is to send them back quickly. Many come from violent societies and inevitably crime is already beginning to rise.\"</p> <p>His outburst was condemned by MPs across the political spectrum. Tony Blair told MPs: \"Many, many people, including many members of this house, have backgrounds that come from other countries. In this modern day and age, surely it is not merely a principle that is morally right, but a principle in our self interests that anyone, irrespective of their race or ethnic background, is a full and proper member of our society.\"</p> <p>Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, who raised the issue at prime minister's questions, accused Mr Hague of fostering racism in his party. \"Mr Townend's remarks confirm the inevitable result of William Hague's leadership. Mr Hague has set an uncomfortable tone within his own party over the last few months. His comments on Britain being a 'foreign land' and his obsession with 'bogus asylum seekers' have given credence to offensive opinions within his ranks.\"</p> <p>Mr Kennedy was congratulated by the former prime minister Sir Edward Heath who told the Lib Dem leader: \"I had to sack Enoch, you know.\" Sir Edward's reference to the late Enoch Powell, who was sacked from the shadow cabinet after his explosive speech, was seen as a rebuke to Mr Hague, who refused to remove the Tory whip from Mr Townend.</p> <p>Mr Hague issued a strong statement rebuking the retiring MP, but pointedly stopped short of taking any action. The Tory leader, who recently joined Britain's other main political leaders to sign an anti-racist declaration which was boycotted by Mr Townend, described the remarks as \"totally unacceptable and I wholly repudiate them\".</p> <p>A Tory spokesman said that Mr Townend had been \"severely rebuked\" by the party's whips at Westminster. Tory sources insisted that they would have no truck with racists. One shadow cabinet minister said: \"John Townend is standing down at the election - I say good riddance to him. He is a sour-faced rightwinger who has no place in today's party.\" However, the leadership's attempts to portray the Tory party as anti-racist were undermined by the racist election leaflets seen by the Guardian. In Dagenham, voters are told that Labour will not fly the union flag in the constituency \"because it would upset ethnic minorities\".</p> <p>Tories in the marginal seat of Medway claim that Labour is hoping to admit increasing numbers of asylum seekers, adding that the \u00a3915m spent on asylum seekers was 100 times the amount needed for a local hospital.

However, there is a fear among some Tories that Mr Hague gave the green light to such dangerous language when he warned earlier this month that a second Labour term would turn Britain into a \"foreign land\". One shadow minister said: \"That speech was definitely a mistake. I have no problem in saying that Blair will change Britain beyond recognition. But it was wrong to use such an emotive term in a speech which also mentioned asylum seekers.\"</p> <p>Despite Mr Hague's questionable speech, there is no doubt that the Tory party at Westminster has changed since the 1980s when activists and some MPs were members of the racist Monday Club.</p> <p>As a member of the Monday Club in the 1980s, the young rightwinger John Bercow called for the voluntary repatriation of black and Asian people, repeal of the Race Relations Act and abolition of the commission for racial equality.

      "trailText": "<p>The star of Top Gun, Witness and The Accused talks to Emma Brockes about her new movie, The Monkey's Mask, and the problems that she faced, as a mother of two, with the film's explicit sex scenes   </p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The most frequently asked question at Kelly's Bar and Grill is, \"Where's Tom?\" A Caribbean restaurant in Key West, Florida, it serves buffalo wings, crab cakes, grilled lobster and a homely number called Kelly's shrimp fettucini. Customers take photos of it and post them on the internet because the Kelly of the shrimp dish is Kelly McGillis, while Tom is Tom Cruise. The pair's collaboration on the 1986 movie Top Gun impressed teenagers enough to send them shuffling into the actor's joint, 15 years later, in search of an ending. </p> <p>\"They come in asking, 'Where's Tom?'\" says McGillis wearily. \"And I say, 'I don't know. I guess he's somewhere else.' And they say, 'Well, aren't you married?' I mean, these are adults, for Christ's sake. I have to say to them, 'That was a movie - it was fake.' People come in and go, 'You cut your hair.' And I go, 'Yuh, I've cut my hair in the last 15 years. I hope you have too.' It drives me a little nutty.\" </p> <p>There are two reasons for the enduring fascination with McGillis's role as flight instructor Charlie Blackwood: Top Gun's status as a symbol of the glossy 1980s and McGillis's subsequent withdrawal from blockbuster movie-making. She is more famous as the subject of \"where are they now?\" enquiries than for the roles she created to provoke them. </p> <p>After Top Gun, McGillis freaked out, moved to Florida and put most of her energy into catering. Witness, the Amish country thriller in which she starred with Harrison Ford, was not seen widely enough to unseat her public image as a springy-haired siren riding pillion to the strains of Take My Breath Away. </p> <p>This week she has taken a break from the restaurant to be in London for the opening of The Monkey's Mask, a low-budget Australian flick directed by Samantha Lang. Based on \"a novel in poetry\" by Dorothy Porter, it is the story of Jill, a private detective investigating the death of a young girl while falling in love with the girl's poetry lecturer (played by McGillis). </p> <p>The movie, which has had its premiere as part of the London Lesbian and Gay film festival, is powerfully shot and has a dream-like quality to it, although of the kind used by young directors to mitigate structural problems. The sex scenes are explicit, the performances strong and the end result is a chaotic but interesting film. The kind description is \"experimental\", the honest one \"pretentious gubbins\". It appealed to McGillis, she says, because of its juxtaposition of beautiful poetic language and dark, ugly subject matter. \"I read the book and thought, it's in verse, it's interesting, it's challenging. I thought it was a courageous move.\" </p> <p>Even in an empty London restaurant it takes a few moments to recognise McGillis. She's Florida-tanned, with the pinched look of someone who's spent too many hours in the gym. She's also in the slightly crabby stages of jet lag. \"Listen. At 43, I don't give a shit what people's expectations of me are. It took me a long time to learn that. If other people are disappointed, that's not my fault. It's a stupid way to live your life, to make other people happy. You can't.\" </p> <p>The expectations in this case are that The Monkey's Mask is some kind of coming-out statement for McGillis, the denouement of a rumour that took off after she shot the rape drama The Accused with Jodie Foster. It is pathetic, she says, but she is accustomed to it. \"I knew that making this film would start all that up again. And it doesn't bother me. Next week I'm coming out as an Amish, the week after that as a navy pilot. This is a role, not a statement about my life. It isn't about me 'coming out', but if people want to think that - fine. I don't care.\" </p> <p>Florida - especially the Keys - has a large gay population and if McGillis's choice of film reveals anything, she says, it is the core liberal belief that people should live their lives the way they want to, preferably with backing from the state. \"If two people are in love, I have a hard time saying they shouldn't get married. If that's what you choose to do with your life, that's wonderful. Love and happiness are so hard to find in this world that if you can find them, God bless you.\" </p> <p>McGillis treads a weird line between flinty belligerence and self-deprecation. She says she cried during the filming of The Monkey's Mask because she had to do sex scenes with a woman 20 years her junior. \"Every night I was on the phone to my husband, crying, 'Am I pretty?' I was scared to death. It's hard exposing yourself physically in front of millions of people when you've had two kids.\" </p> <p>At the same time, she thinks that actors who kick up a fuss to anyone but their partners are completely pitiful. One of the reasons she stopped doing big-budget films was the hours wasted while the star threw a tantrum. \"I've worked with actors who, when the director says, 'You have to sit down and cry,' say, 'I don't know how to do that.' Well - hello? - that's your job. I've been in situations where actors will lock themselves in their trailers for hours and say, 'I'm not coming out, I'm not taking my clothes off.' And it's like, 'You know what, honey? You read the script, you knew you were gonna be naked, so get out here and do the shot, 'cause I want to go home and have lunch with my kids. OK?'\" </p> <p>If McGillis displays the zeal of a convert, it's because for a while she was in danger of being sucked into the celebrity whirlpool she had despised since high school. Despite growing up in LA, she always wanted to work in theatre and as a teenager ran away to New York to train at the Juilliard drama school. She stood before the mirror and ruled out a career in movies. \"My whole image of myself was a tall, fat, geeky, ugly girl that nobody liked. I thought I was too tall for the movies - I'm still taller than anyone I work with. It never crossed my mind that someone might want to hire me for a movie.\" </p> <p>But in 1983, after four years of heavy-duty method work, she landed a role in Reuben Reuben, a comedy with Tom Conti, and made a big enough impression to win the lead role as an Amish woman in Witness in 1985. Then came Top Gun. McGillis pauses, reluctant to slag it off even at this late stage, then laughs and says what she thinks. \"I didn't want to do it - there. But because I'd done Witness, I owed Paramount another film, and my agent said, 'You have to do this.' I took one look at it and said, 'This is like a western in the sky - I don't wanna do this.' </p> <p>\"It wasn't about acting, it was about being a cartoon character. You know what I mean? I could have done it blindfolded. I was grateful for the fact that it gave me opportunities I wouldn't otherwise have had. But I showed up for work, did my bit, hung out with a bunch of boys, played baseball, and went home. It was like being at camp.

      "bodyText": "The most frequently asked question at Kelly's Bar and Grill is, \"Where's Tom?\" A Caribbean restaurant in Key West, Florida, it serves buffalo wings, crab cakes, grilled lobster and a homely number called Kelly's shrimp fettucini. Customers take photos of it and post them on the internet because the Kelly of the shrimp dish is Kelly McGillis, while Tom is Tom Cruise. The pair's collaboration on the 1986 movie Top Gun impressed teenagers enough to send them shuffling into the actor's joint, 15 years later, in search of an ending. \"They come in asking, 'Where's Tom?'\" says McGillis wearily. \"And I say, 'I don't know. I guess he's somewhere else.' And they say, 'Well, aren't you married?' I mean, these are adults, for Christ's sake. I have to say to them, 'That was a movie - it was fake.' People come in and go, 'You cut your hair.' And I go, 'Yuh, I've cut my hair in the last 15 years. I hope you have too.' It drives me a little nutty.\" There are two reasons for the enduring fascination with McGillis's role as flight instructor Charlie Blackwood: Top Gun's status as a symbol of the glossy 1980s and McGillis's subsequent withdrawal from blockbuster movie-making. She is more famous as the subject of \"where are they now?\" enquiries than for the roles she created to provoke them. After Top Gun, McGillis freaked out, moved to Florida and put most of her energy into catering. Witness, the Amish country thriller in which she starred with Harrison Ford, was not seen widely enough to unseat her public image as a springy-haired siren riding pillion to the strains of Take My Breath Away. This week she has taken a break from the restaurant to be in London for the opening of The Monkey's Mask, a low-budget Australian flick directed by Samantha Lang. Based on \"a novel in poetry\" by Dorothy Porter, it is the story of Jill, a private detective investigating the death of a young girl while falling in love with the girl's poetry lecturer (played by McGillis). The movie, which has had its premiere as part of the London Lesbian and Gay film festival, is powerfully shot and has a dream-like quality to it, although of the kind used by young directors to mitigate structural problems. The sex scenes are explicit, the performances strong and the end result is a chaotic but interesting film. The kind description is \"experimental\", the honest one \"pretentious gubbins\". It appealed to McGillis, she says, because of its juxtaposition of beautiful poetic language and dark, ugly subject matter. \"I read the book and thought, it's in verse, it's interesting, it's challenging. I thought it was a courageous move.\" Even in an empty London restaurant it takes a few moments to recognise McGillis. She's Florida-tanned, with the pinched look of someone who's spent too many hours in the gym. She's also in the slightly crabby stages of jet lag. \"Listen. At 43, I don't give a shit what people's expectations of me are. It took me a long time to learn that. If other people are disappointed, that's not my fault. It's a stupid way to live your life, to make other people happy. You can't.\" The expectations in this case are that The Monkey's Mask is some kind of coming-out statement for McGillis, the denouement of a rumour that took off after she shot the rape drama The Accused with Jodie Foster. It is pathetic, she says, but she is accustomed to it. \"I knew that making this film would start all that up again. And it doesn't bother me. Next week I'm coming out as an Amish, the week after that as a navy pilot. This is a role, not a statement about my life. It isn't about me 'coming out', but if people want to think that - fine. I don't care.\" Florida - especially the Keys - has a large gay population and if McGillis's choice of film reveals anything, she says, it is the core liberal belief that people should live their lives the way they want to, preferably with backing from the state. \"If two people are in love, I have a hard time saying they shouldn't get married. If that's what you choose to do with your life, that's wonderful. Love and happiness are so hard to find in this world that if you can find them, God bless you.\" McGillis treads a weird line between flinty belligerence and self-deprecation. She says she cried during the filming of The Monkey's Mask because she had to do sex scenes with a woman 20 years her junior. \"Every night I was on the phone to my husband, crying, 'Am I pretty?' I was scared to death. It's hard exposing yourself physically in front of millions of people when you've had two kids.\" At the same time, she thinks that actors who kick up a fuss to anyone but their partners are completely pitiful. One of the reasons she stopped doing big-budget films was the hours wasted while the star threw a tantrum. \"I've worked with actors who, when the director says, 'You have to sit down and cry,' say, 'I don't know how to do that.' Well - hello? - that's your job. I've been in situations where actors will lock themselves in their trailers for hours and say, 'I'm not coming out, I'm not taking my clothes off.' And it's like, 'You know what, honey? You read the script, you knew you were gonna be naked, so get out here and do the shot, 'cause I want to go home and have lunch with my kids. OK?'\" If McGillis displays the zeal of a convert, it's because for a while she was in danger of being sucked into the celebrity whirlpool she had despised since high school. Despite growing up in LA, she always wanted to work in theatre and as a teenager ran away to New York to train at the Juilliard drama school. She stood before the mirror and ruled out a career in movies. \"My whole image of myself was a tall, fat, geeky, ugly girl that nobody liked. I thought I was too tall for the movies - I'm still taller than anyone I work with. It never crossed my mind that someone might want to hire me for a movie.\" But in 1983, after four years of heavy-duty method work, she landed a role in Reuben Reuben, a comedy with Tom Conti, and made a big enough impression to win the lead role as an Amish woman in Witness in 1985. Then came Top Gun. McGillis pauses, reluctant to slag it off even at this late stage, then laughs and says what she thinks. \"I didn't want to do it - there. But because I'd done Witness, I owed Paramount another film, and my agent said, 'You have to do this.' I took one look at it and said, 'This is like a western in the sky - I don't wanna do this.' \"It wasn't about acting, it was about being a cartoon character. You know what I mean? I could have done it blindfolded. I was grateful for the fact that it gave me opportunities I wouldn't otherwise have had. But I showed up for work, did my bit, hung out with a bunch of boys, played baseball, and went home. It was like being at camp. Why they hired me I'll never know.\" She was tempted by the crazy offers that followed the film's release and spent months \"terribly depressed\" with indecision. \"I didn't know how to deal with it. I didn't know how to be a household name, because it's never what I aspired to. I didn't want to live up to these huge expectations. I wanted to be able to go the store and buy Tampax without being asked for my autograph. I wanted to be a mom to my kids.\" So she flew to Washington DC, did a theatre production of Chekhov's The Seagull, got married to a yachting millionaire, Fred Tillman, and had two children, now 10 and seven. She bought a restaurant in Florida, waited tables, and deflected the astonishment of customers who recognised her as one of the most famous actresses of the 1980s. In between, she satisfied her creative instinct by doing low-budget films and a lot of theatre. \"I want to be acting when I'm 92,\" she says. \"I want to die acting, and that wasn't going to happen if I carried on doing films like Top Gun. So I decided I would always try to do something unexpected, not to shake up other people's ideas of me, but for myself.\" And she invites those who don't like it to kiss her \"big, fat ass\".",

All police leave in the metropolitan area cancelled, local pubs \"redecorated\" you get the picture. It really means something!</p> <p><strong>Kit</strong></p> <p>The most controversial thing our chairman did was to change our traditional blue and white kit to all white and revert to a more traditional badge to be more \"user friendly\". Re-introducing the blue kit for away games was purely a means of extracting more dosh from the punters. The Lions play in blue and white: end of.</p> <p><strong>Most ridiculous piece of merchandise</strong></p> <p>A \u00a3200 crystal replica of the Den (although the incinerator adjacent to the ground is not included).

The least popular player ever would take about five pages - we have had rather a lot! We don't care that much about other teams players, although we did have the satisfaction of driving Paul Birch out of the game. He had floppy blond hair. Nuff said?</p> <p><strong>What's your ground like? </strong></p> <p>The \"New\" Den nearly finished us off, so feelings are mixed. When it's full, the atmosphere is quite lively. Most intellectuals can be found in the south lower having a \"free and frank exchange of views\" with the visiting keeper, or giving advice, most of which is physically impossible.</p> <p><strong>What to do when you get there </strong></p> <p>Visiting northerners may care to sample the delights that the many car-breaker's yards in the area offer. Alternatively, a cold Den Burger and chips with a couple of pints of recycled piss laughingly called \"Lager\" will sustain them on the long journey home. <strong>Links</strong></p> <p>There are a great variety of Millwall websites: some good, some poor and some plain boring. For sheer excellence, though, we suggest a visit to Tits, Fanny and Millwall (http://www.titsfannyandmillwall.co.uk/). Alternatively, The Lion Roars fanzine has been around for even longer than us, it's a good read even if they do tend to take themselves rather seriously.</p>",

Crippled Palarse and West Ham are the traditional rivals. We had a brief flirtation with Gillingham and Wigan, but nothing quite compares with the thrill of a local derby with the hamsters. All police leave in the metropolitan area cancelled, local pubs \"redecorated\" you get the picture. It really means something! Kit The most controversial thing our chairman did was to change our traditional blue and white kit to all white and revert to a more traditional badge to be more \"user friendly\". Re-introducing the blue kit for away games was purely a means of extracting more dosh from the punters. The Lions play in blue and white: end of. Most ridiculous piece of merchandise A \u00a3200 crystal replica of the Den (although the incinerator adjacent to the ground is not included). Anyone considering this sort of overpriced crap really should seek medical help. Mascot Zampa the Lion, some sad YTS kid who hasn't got the nerve to tell the club to bog off. Having said that, the current wearer of the smelly suit does seem up for it, although a recent run in with Cyril the Swan which resulted in Zampa losing his head may well calm him down. Player rated Neil Harris, the league's top scorer. The most popular ever depends on your age: Teddy Sheringham, Terry Hurlock, Barry Kitchener or the legendary Harry Cripps are heroes all. Player hated Oddly enough for us, we don't have any real villains since Bobby Bowry and Jamie Stuart were banished to the reserves to see out their contracts. The least popular player ever would take about five pages - we have had rather a lot! We don't care that much about other teams players, although we did have the satisfaction of driving Paul Birch out of the game. He had floppy blond hair. Nuff said? What's your ground like? The \"New\" Den nearly finished us off, so feelings are mixed. When it's full, the atmosphere is quite lively. Most intellectuals can be found in the south lower having a \"free and frank exchange of views\" with the visiting keeper, or giving advice, most of which is physically impossible. What to do when you get there Visiting northerners may care to sample the delights that the many car-breaker's yards in the area offer. Alternatively, a cold Den Burger and chips with a couple of pints of recycled piss laughingly called \"Lager\" will sustain them on the long journey home. Links There are a great variety of Millwall websites: some good, some poor and some plain boring. For sheer excellence, though, we suggest a visit to Tits, Fanny and Millwall (http://www.titsfannyandmillwall.co.uk/). Alternatively, The Lion Roars fanzine has been around for even longer than us, it's a good read even if they do tend to take themselves rather seriously.",

He was, he said, too busy to bother with other newspapers. The fact that the Times was firmly Tory and, after a few years of Labour government, almost hysterically anti-socialist, didn't worry him at all. \"That's what one expects,\" he said. \"It's quite reliable in that, which is, in its way, rather restful. And the cricket reports are good.\" Under New Labour, by contrast, every day in Downing Street starts with a careful sifting of the press; there are strong responses to any stories which might have been 'inspired' or leaked. Enormous care is taken to try to manage the news not just in the obvious sense of trying to put a positive spin on whatever the Government is doing but, more fundamentally, in blocking off whole policy areas because they might result in a damaging headline in the Sun or the Mail.</p> <p>This ultra-sensitivity has inevitably increased the importance of the media managers. When the Northern Ireland negotiations got serious Tony Blair took Alistair Campbell into the room with him and insisted that Mo Mowlam remain outside. David Trimble was astonished but that's how it always is with New Labour. Andrew Rawnsley records how the momentous decision that Britain would not join the euro during the current parliament was taken. Aware of the increase in Euroscepticism from Philip Gould's focus groups and daily readings of the Sun and the Mail, Gordon Brown's press secretary, Charlie Whelan, and his economic adviser, Ed Balls, sent the Times a fax hinting at a major policy change while Whelan tried to persuade the Sun to go with the headline 'Brown Saves Pound'. Whelan, operating from his mobile phone on the pavement outside a pub, confirmed to the BBC and ITN: \"Yes, Gordon is ruling out British membership.\" Word rapidly spread that this massive policy shift on what Brown had called \"the most important question the country is likely to face in a generation\" was being announced to the world from a mobile phone against a background of general inebriation.</p> <p>When the story came out not as a hint but as an emphatic rejection of Europe, there was consternation: Britain's relations with the EU were on the line. Peter Mandelson, horrified at the implications - he styled himself Minister for Looking Ahead - was sure that this all resulted from leaving him out of the loop. Blair was alerted and asked Whelan what had happened. Whelan told him that the report merely echoed Government policy. \"Who says it's our policy?\" the prime minister asked - he had not been consulted - and ordered Whelan to \"row back\". \"Sorry, Tony, it's too late,\" he was told. A conference call between Blair, Campbell, Brown, Balls, Mandelson and Whelan dealt with the crisis. No one thought it odd that the real inner cabinet not only did not include the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, but comprised four spinners and only two responsible ministers.</p> <p>As Rawnsley points out, the curious thing about Blair is that, however much he wants to reject ideology, he is also endlessly eager to explain himself, to insist that there is a big idea, that there are principles, that there is, indeed, an ideology of the Third Way. The result of all these attempted explanations is utter vacuity. The nearest thing to a big idea - and it is the fundament to which Blair always returns under pressure - is that most Labour governments of the 20th century were failures, that Labour never managed to become 'the natural party of government' as Harold Wilson wished, and that this was reflected in its failure ever to get elected for two full terms. Traumatised by four successive defeats, Blair wanted above all to make Labour electable and then to secure those two full terms. This would demonstrate that Blairism had overcome Labour's congenital weakness. The problem was that there was no New Labour project to rival that of Attlee or Thatcher, no real idea of what those two full terms were to be about.</p> <p>Blair sought to make up for this by leaning on the venerable sage Lord Jenkins for advice. (Rawnsley appears to accept this estimate, repeatedly referring to Jenkins as \"the great historian\", apparently unaware that serious historians regard Jenkins as a coffee-table lightweight.) What Jenkins had to offer was a passionate Europeanism and a belief that it was Labour's split from the Liberals early in the century that had allowed the Tories to dominate government down the years. The remarriage of Lib and Lab should, he argued, be cemented by a change from first-past-the-post to proportional representation, which would not only make parliament a much truer reflection of the popular will but would result in an alliance resembling the broader formation of the Democratic Party in the US.</p> <p>This all sounded plausible enough, although a moment's reflection would have suggested a number of difficulties. The basic problem with Europeanism in Britain has, after all, been its fear of the popular will. This was why the champions of Europe like Jenkins, knowing full well that British voters would not swallow what they regarded as the sacrifice of national sovereignty, never liked to tell them the truth - which was that its continental founders were, from the outset, determined to build a federal Europe. This was why, when Heath took Britain into Europe, he pretended to have \"the full-hearted consent of the people\" but carefully avoided letting them have any say in the matter. It is also why, when Labour committed itself to a referendum, Jenkins was so horrified that he resigned the Party's deputy leadership. And it is also why Blair, having committed himself to a referendum on entry into the euro has failed to call one in his first term (he's promised a decision within two years of a second - as long as economic conditions are met, of course).</p> <p>The trouble with Lib-Labbery was that this was Jenkins's third stab at the problem. For most of his career he had been firmly Labour and had repeatedly sworn that he would never, but never, launch a centre party. Then he left Labour to do just that. That initiative having come to grief, here he was arguing for a British version of the Democratic party. Given New Labour's love affair with Clintonism, this was attractive to Blair: inconveniently, after a few years of listening to such advice he found himself impaled on the unpopularity of the euro, on the one hand, while having, on the other, allowed the Welsh and Scottish assemblies to be elected on a PR basis, only to end up with Labour losing its majority in both cases. To make matters worse, the Welsh assembly soon fell to a Labour leader Blair had done everything to stop. It wasn't long before something similar happened in London, though this hasn't stopped Blair, in generous pre-election mood, again promising the Lib-Dems a referendum on PR, to be held in 2003-4.</p> <p>When Mitterrand introduced elected regional assemblies throughout France, for the first time fundamentally reforming the rule from the prefecture which had been bequeathed by Napoleon, he announced that regionalisation would be \"la grande affaire du septennat\". Using power with deliberation to make large strategic choices is precisely what New Labour doesn't do. Rawnsley is doubtless typical in regarding the high points of Blairism in power as constitutional reform - particularly in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - the Kosovo war and Blair's address to the nation in the wake of Diana's death, a moment which \"confirmed Tony Blair as the consummate political actor of his age\". Yet Rawnsley makes it equally clear that Blair could hardly have cared less about either Wales or Scotland before entering office - and it's doubtful he'd even heard of Kosovo. And what significance to give to the Diana address? Things would not, after all, have had to be very different to produce headlines suggesting that Diana died while neglecting her children to go night-clubbing with the playboy son of one of the country's least attractive characters. Would Blair have then moralised sternly before the cameras? And what to make of all the guff about Diana being \"a People's Princess\" when not only Cherie Blair but most of the cabinet are staunch republicans?</p> <p>New Labour's sheer lack of coherence is nowhere more striking than when one looks at its greatest achievement, constitutional reform. Britain has ended up with assemblies in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland which have very different powers from one another and no counterpart in the English regions. And whereas Scotland is still massively over-represented at Westminster, Wales is not, and Northern Ireland is under-represented. There is no rationale for this any more than there is for having PR in some elections but not in others. The Upper House has been 'reformed' to reduce the number of hereditary peers - but the qualification for belonging is still to be a peer. No other European country would entertain such antique nonsense for a moment - and if the hereditary principle is wrong, why have it at all? The European Convention on Human Rights has been incorporated into British law, but the whole point about such fundamental rights is that they ought to be entrenched. Without a written constitution this is impossible. The whole constitutional construction is jerry-built, riven by contradictions at every level and thus unstable.</p> <p>If New Labour really was 'a party of principle' it would have started by recognising that you can't have constitutional reform without first having a written constitution. Drafting such a document would not merely allow the government to entrench the Bill of Rights but require it to think through the answers to such questions as whether it is or is not in favour of the hereditary principle (for the moment New Labour has decided in favour of a 'partially pregnant' view on this), whether Britain is to be a federal state or not, and so on.</p> <p>Among the advantages of such an approach is that the government would have to decide whether any part of Ireland is really part of Britain. The absurd situation we are now in allows Blair, while negotiating with Trimble, to confide to him that \"Really I'm a Unionist,\" as if this were simply a matter of personal conviction. In practice, of course, British governments have assumed for more than a generation now that, in every cabinet, there has to be a minister for Northern Ireland, whose job it is to preside over a great deal of mayhem while coaxing and cajoling \"a peaceful solution\" out of a kaleidoscope of groups stretching from Ian Paisley's branch of the Unionists through to Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness and whoever they officially or unofficially represent. Typically, this 'peaceful solution' seems to involve shuffling Northern Ireland into a closer relationship with the Irish Republic and trying to get the spectrum of political groups to agree that this is what they want or, at least, will accept. Because this is basically impossible, as the failure of Blair's efforts has again proved, we have to go on having a cabinet minister for Northern Ireland, whose job will never end in success.</p> <p>And yet Blair has been known to speak admiringly of the way in which De Gaulle extricated France from Algeria, overcoming the ferocious resistance of the army, air force, more than a million French settlers and many other elements of the French establishment. It is worth recalling that De Gaulle realised the impossibility of achieving consensus within Algeria over its future: a decision therefore had to be taken in the long-term interests of the French state. He himself would have preferred to keep Algeria French but forsaw that the price would be endless civil strife and expense, which would jeopardise many other national objectives. Every soldier knew, De Gaulle intoned gravely, that there were times when \"to save a healthy body one has to amputate a diseased limb.\" Having taken this decision, and ratified it by successive referenda, he pressed it through remorselessly to a conclusion. He was simply not prepared to countenance the generations of waste, bloodshed and distraction which the political elite in Britain has put up with rather than take a similarly tough-minded decision about Northern Ireland, though there is little doubt that the vast middle ground, in Britain as in France, would, if given the chance, vote to be done with the problem once and for all. But if that is ever to happen the first requirement is that the Irish problem be seen as the constitutional issue it is.</p> <p>New Labour has been endlessly castigated for its spin-doctoring and news management, black arts of which Peter Mandelson was the emblematic figure. The fact that Mandelson has proved himself peculiarly bad at managing his own political career cannot alter the fact that he had, as Donald Macintyre makes clear, an instinctive grasp of the dynamics of the new media-led democracy, a skill certainly needed to pull off the Houdini-like feat of rescuing Labour from the state to which it had sunk in the early 1980s. But far more serious than New Labour's management of the news has been the management of New Labour by tomorrow's possible headlines and the government's resulting lack of any long-term rationale. How, otherwise, can Rawnsley conclude that, after three years in power, it should suddenly dawn on the government that it had made a major strategic mistake by not investing more in health, education and other public services? If Gordon Brown is clever, how come he could make a blunder as big and as simple as that? By Christmas last year it was clear that New Labour was presiding over a new winter of discontent, with the government's management of everything from the health service and cattle disease to public transport under fierce popular scrutiny. John Prescott, with his two Jaguars and his immense self-satisfaction, became an obvious target for embittered travellers, but the gross strategic error was the failure to make long-term decisions years ago, when there was ample warning on these matters. The vacuity of the Third Way could hardly be better illustrated.</p> <p>This short-termism feeds on itself. Rawnsley quotes a cabinet member's comment that after three years in power \"it's worse now. What you have to understand is that every day is a panic. We're so neurotic.\" The reason for this is the decline of all the key institutions which used to hold political leaders responsible: the mass party, the cabinet and parliament. Labour party membership has fallen from 1,015,000 in 1952 to 387,776 in 1999 and members are anyway regarded by the leadership with deep distrust. The usurpation of the cabinet's power by Thatcher has been completed by Blair - it is now all but impossible for ministers to emerge as major political players on their own account. By the end of the 1964-70 Wilson administration, everyone knew that Callaghan, Jenkins, George Brown, Healey, Castle, Crosland, Shore, Benn, Stewart and Crossman were political heavyweights - while the only real heavyweight now besides Blair is Gordon Brown. Parliament's weakness is best gauged by the way the number of MPs keeps creeping up - from 615 before the war to 659 now. America, with over four times Britain's population, manages with 435 congressmen. That number never goes up because congressmen have real power and even a few extra seats would change the balance. Despite an already ludicrously large legislature, Britain has always found it easier to add a few seats here, a few seats there - because MPs have so little power.</p> <p>This liberation of party leaders from the restraints of constitutional responsibility has bizarre effects. On the one hand, the gap is filled by the media - and, despite third-generation TV, fifth-generation radio and all the pubescent excitement of dot.commery, it is the print media which set the agenda, with the result that in the 21st century, as in the 20th, it is the press barons who count. The resulting need to respond to the daily reactions of the tabloids produces bland, predictable, vacuous leaders - and a corresponding public hunger for figures who are a bit more human, and unscripted. Only this can explain the appeal of the shambolic Rhodri Morgan, the provenly disastrous Ken Livingstone and such characters as Ann Widdecombe and Mo Mowlam. By any ordinary standards both these women should have been political disasters: the touchy-feely Mowlam, stealing other people's drinks, talking obsessively about sex, insisting on conducting business while sitting open-doored on the lavatory, saying 'fuck' all the time and picking her nose in public; the even more appalling Widdecombe, the Billy Graham disciple, the believer that \"God is a great ball of light,\" the easy prey to every reactionary truism, believing always that she had discovered it for the first time. At least Mowlam values sex, while Widdecombe believes that \"Sex is yuk. I'm very grateful that when I get home at night there isn't a man making silly demands. Ugh, that is one thing I don't miss. That sex thing is so over-rated.\" Which is to say that both Mowlam and Widdecombe have little in common with Ms Britain - but at least they sound like real eccentrics, they are their own people. Mowlam told Blair that she ought to be foreign secretary because she was \"a people person\". Blair, unsurprisingly, did not entertain such nonsense, nor, when confronted by Widdicombe's at least equally simplistic demands, will William Hague.</p> <p>The fact that Labour has now loosed itself from its traditional moorings and restraints is visible, too, in the growing sleaze chronicled by Tom Bower. Although Bower has concentrated his efforts on Robert Maxwell and (the intimately connected) Geoffrey Robinson, many more are encompassed by the allegations he raises - it is not just a matter of Peter Mandelson but of Bernard Donoghue, Gordon Brown, Helen Liddell, Alistair Campbell and Charlie Whelan. Stephen Byers and Robinson are currently trying to prevent the sale of Bower's book, but one would like to hear how others mentioned here respond. Of course, Labour sleaze is nothing new, though it did not, in Attlee's day, get anywhere near the top. Ever since the latter days of Wilson - particularly his final honours list - it has never been far from it.</p> <p>Despite all the theoretical nonsense regarding the Third Way - has there ever been a more publicly ridiculous intellectual than Anthony Giddens? - the key test of Blairism is still the one it set itself: can it make New Labour the 'normal party of government'? The answer is obvious: Blair will get his two terms easily enough, if only thanks to Hague, but what he won't do is build a ruling bloc capable of lasting in the long term, like the New Deal coalition did, because such regimes generally emerge in response to crisis - a war or depression - and are signalled by what political scientists call \"a critical election\". Such regimes are also built round a coherent philosophy and programme - which New Labour is not. Even if Blair were to go for a permanent Lib-Lab deal, it would be unlikely to produce a 'normal party of government' which could enjoy 13 and 18-year runs like the Tories had in 1951-64 and 1979-97.</p> <p>There is a basic failure to understand a key question of political sociology here. Charles Kennedy bemoans the fact that the turnout in elections is falling, pointing out that the 71.4 per cent turnout in 1997 was the lowest in any general election since 1945 and was followed by a further slump in the 1999 Euro-elections, when fewer than 25 per cent voted. In a table of 20 industrialised nations Britain comes 14th. Historically, of course, Italy had the highest turnouts among Western countries, followed by France, then Britain, with the US bottom of the class. The reason for this hierarchy was obvious. Normally, the old are more inclined to vote than the young, the rich and educated more than the poor and uneducated. This is a huge handicap to a party which relies on working-class votes. The only way to counter it is to have a strong party organisation. Italy had 90 per cent turnouts because it had the strongest Communist party in Europe, able to reach into every crack and crevice to pull out the vote. France had the second strongest such party, Britain a less impressive but still strong working-class political organisation, while in the US, which had no such thing, upper social groups had a participation advantage of at least 20 per cent over lower ones. Famously, white racists could still get elected in the South even after the 1965 Voting Rights Act gave all blacks the vote - because blacks just didn't turn out.</p> <p>Thus the greater the distance the Labour party puts between its old role and its new one, the more one should expect turnout to fall. Nothing will make that fall more permanent than the sort of Lib-Lab deal Jenkins wants, for in that new political environment the older, better educated and richer Tory voters will have an increasing participation advantage. So before Blair tries to build a British version of the American Democrats he might reflect that despite the 20-year supremacy of the New Deal coalition, 20th century America had Republican Presidents for 52 years, Democratic ones for 48 and that since the 1965 Act - which should have given the Democrats a huge new advantage - Republicans have won the presidency six times to the Democrats' three. But in any case one rather doubts that Blair is the man to fashion New Labour into anything other than what it already is. The Third Way, it turns out, was shorthand for a bland and manipulative short-termism. Blair just doesn't seem to be the man for the big idea, for grand strategy, for, if you like, 'the vision thing'.

He was, he said, too busy to bother with other newspapers. The fact that the Times was firmly Tory and, after a few years of Labour government, almost hysterically anti-socialist, didn't worry him at all. \"That's what one expects,\" he said. \"It's quite reliable in that, which is, in its way, rather restful. And the cricket reports are good.\" Under New Labour, by contrast, every day in Downing Street starts with a careful sifting of the press; there are strong responses to any stories which might have been 'inspired' or leaked. Enormous care is taken to try to manage the news not just in the obvious sense of trying to put a positive spin on whatever the Government is doing but, more fundamentally, in blocking off whole policy areas because they might result in a damaging headline in the Sun or the Mail. This ultra-sensitivity has inevitably increased the importance of the media managers. When the Northern Ireland negotiations got serious Tony Blair took Alistair Campbell into the room with him and insisted that Mo Mowlam remain outside. David Trimble was astonished but that's how it always is with New Labour. Andrew Rawnsley records how the momentous decision that Britain would not join the euro during the current parliament was taken. Aware of the increase in Euroscepticism from Philip Gould's focus groups and daily readings of the Sun and the Mail, Gordon Brown's press secretary, Charlie Whelan, and his economic adviser, Ed Balls, sent the Times a fax hinting at a major policy change while Whelan tried to persuade the Sun to go with the headline 'Brown Saves Pound'. Whelan, operating from his mobile phone on the pavement outside a pub, confirmed to the BBC and ITN: \"Yes, Gordon is ruling out British membership.\" Word rapidly spread that this massive policy shift on what Brown had called \"the most important question the country is likely to face in a generation\" was being announced to the world from a mobile phone against a background of general inebriation. When the story came out not as a hint but as an emphatic rejection of Europe, there was consternation: Britain's relations with the EU were on the line. Peter Mandelson, horrified at the implications - he styled himself Minister for Looking Ahead - was sure that this all resulted from leaving him out of the loop. Blair was alerted and asked Whelan what had happened. Whelan told him that the report merely echoed Government policy. \"Who says it's our policy?\" the prime minister asked - he had not been consulted - and ordered Whelan to \"row back\". \"Sorry, Tony, it's too late,\" he was told. A conference call between Blair, Campbell, Brown, Balls, Mandelson and Whelan dealt with the crisis. No one thought it odd that the real inner cabinet not only did not include the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, but comprised four spinners and only two responsible ministers. As Rawnsley points out, the curious thing about Blair is that, however much he wants to reject ideology, he is also endlessly eager to explain himself, to insist that there is a big idea, that there are principles, that there is, indeed, an ideology of the Third Way. The result of all these attempted explanations is utter vacuity. The nearest thing to a big idea - and it is the fundament to which Blair always returns under pressure - is that most Labour governments of the 20th century were failures, that Labour never managed to become 'the natural party of government' as Harold Wilson wished, and that this was reflected in its failure ever to get elected for two full terms. Traumatised by four successive defeats, Blair wanted above all to make Labour electable and then to secure those two full terms. This would demonstrate that Blairism had overcome Labour's congenital weakness. The problem was that there was no New Labour project to rival that of Attlee or Thatcher, no real idea of what those two full terms were to be about. Blair sought to make up for this by leaning on the venerable sage Lord Jenkins for advice. (Rawnsley appears to accept this estimate, repeatedly referring to Jenkins as \"the great historian\", apparently unaware that serious historians regard Jenkins as a coffee-table lightweight.) What Jenkins had to offer was a passionate Europeanism and a belief that it was Labour's split from the Liberals early in the century that had allowed the Tories to dominate government down the years. The remarriage of Lib and Lab should, he argued, be cemented by a change from first-past-the-post to proportional representation, which would not only make parliament a much truer reflection of the popular will but would result in an alliance resembling the broader formation of the Democratic Party in the US. This all sounded plausible enough, although a moment's reflection would have suggested a number of difficulties. The basic problem with Europeanism in Britain has, after all, been its fear of the popular will. This was why the champions of Europe like Jenkins, knowing full well that British voters would not swallow what they regarded as the sacrifice of national sovereignty, never liked to tell them the truth - which was that its continental founders were, from the outset, determined to build a federal Europe. This was why, when Heath took Britain into Europe, he pretended to have \"the full-hearted consent of the people\" but carefully avoided letting them have any say in the matter. It is also why, when Labour committed itself to a referendum, Jenkins was so horrified that he resigned the Party's deputy leadership. And it is also why Blair, having committed himself to a referendum on entry into the euro has failed to call one in his first term (he's promised a decision within two years of a second - as long as economic conditions are met, of course). The trouble with Lib-Labbery was that this was Jenkins's third stab at the problem. For most of his career he had been firmly Labour and had repeatedly sworn that he would never, but never, launch a centre party. Then he left Labour to do just that. That initiative having come to grief, here he was arguing for a British version of the Democratic party. Given New Labour's love affair with Clintonism, this was attractive to Blair: inconveniently, after a few years of listening to such advice he found himself impaled on the unpopularity of the euro, on the one hand, while having, on the other, allowed the Welsh and Scottish assemblies to be elected on a PR basis, only to end up with Labour losing its majority in both cases. To make matters worse, the Welsh assembly soon fell to a Labour leader Blair had done everything to stop. It wasn't long before something similar happened in London, though this hasn't stopped Blair, in generous pre-election mood, again promising the Lib-Dems a referendum on PR, to be held in 2003-4. When Mitterrand introduced elected regional assemblies throughout France, for the first time fundamentally reforming the rule from the prefecture which had been bequeathed by Napoleon, he announced that regionalisation would be \"la grande affaire du septennat\". Using power with deliberation to make large strategic choices is precisely what New Labour doesn't do. Rawnsley is doubtless typical in regarding the high points of Blairism in power as constitutional reform - particularly in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - the Kosovo war and Blair's address to the nation in the wake of Diana's death, a moment which \"confirmed Tony Blair as the consummate political actor of his age\". Yet Rawnsley makes it equally clear that Blair could hardly have cared less about either Wales or Scotland before entering office - and it's doubtful he'd even heard of Kosovo. And what significance to give to the Diana address? Things would not, after all, have had to be very different to produce headlines suggesting that Diana died while neglecting her children to go night-clubbing with the playboy son of one of the country's least attractive characters. Would Blair have then moralised sternly before the cameras? And what to make of all the guff about Diana being \"a People's Princess\" when not only Cherie Blair but most of the cabinet are staunch republicans? New Labour's sheer lack of coherence is nowhere more striking than when one looks at its greatest achievement, constitutional reform. Britain has ended up with assemblies in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland which have very different powers from one another and no counterpart in the English regions. And whereas Scotland is still massively over-represented at Westminster, Wales is not, and Northern Ireland is under-represented. There is no rationale for this any more than there is for having PR in some elections but not in others. The Upper House has been 'reformed' to reduce the number of hereditary peers - but the qualification for belonging is still to be a peer. No other European country would entertain such antique nonsense for a moment - and if the hereditary principle is wrong, why have it at all? The European Convention on Human Rights has been incorporated into British law, but the whole point about such fundamental rights is that they ought to be entrenched. Without a written constitution this is impossible. The whole constitutional construction is jerry-built, riven by contradictions at every level and thus unstable. If New Labour really was 'a party of principle' it would have started by recognising that you can't have constitutional reform without first having a written constitution. Drafting such a document would not merely allow the government to entrench the Bill of Rights but require it to think through the answers to such questions as whether it is or is not in favour of the hereditary principle (for the moment New Labour has decided in favour of a 'partially pregnant' view on this), whether Britain is to be a federal state or not, and so on. Among the advantages of such an approach is that the government would have to decide whether any part of Ireland is really part of Britain. The absurd situation we are now in allows Blair, while negotiating with Trimble, to confide to him that \"Really I'm a Unionist,\" as if this were simply a matter of personal conviction. In practice, of course, British governments have assumed for more than a generation now that, in every cabinet, there has to be a minister for Northern Ireland, whose job it is to preside over a great deal of mayhem while coaxing and cajoling \"a peaceful solution\" out of a kaleidoscope of groups stretching from Ian Paisley's branch of the Unionists through to Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness and whoever they officially or unofficially represent. Typically, this 'peaceful solution' seems to involve shuffling Northern Ireland into a closer relationship with the Irish Republic and trying to get the spectrum of political groups to agree that this is what they want or, at least, will accept. Because this is basically impossible, as the failure of Blair's efforts has again proved, we have to go on having a cabinet minister for Northern Ireland, whose job will never end in success. And yet Blair has been known to speak admiringly of the way in which De Gaulle extricated France from Algeria, overcoming the ferocious resistance of the army, air force, more than a million French settlers and many other elements of the French establishment. It is worth recalling that De Gaulle realised the impossibility of achieving consensus within Algeria over its future: a decision therefore had to be taken in the long-term interests of the French state. He himself would have preferred to keep Algeria French but forsaw that the price would be endless civil strife and expense, which would jeopardise many other national objectives. Every soldier knew, De Gaulle intoned gravely, that there were times when \"to save a healthy body one has to amputate a diseased limb.\" Having taken this decision, and ratified it by successive referenda, he pressed it through remorselessly to a conclusion. He was simply not prepared to countenance the generations of waste, bloodshed and distraction which the political elite in Britain has put up with rather than take a similarly tough-minded decision about Northern Ireland, though there is little doubt that the vast middle ground, in Britain as in France, would, if given the chance, vote to be done with the problem once and for all. But if that is ever to happen the first requirement is that the Irish problem be seen as the constitutional issue it is. New Labour has been endlessly castigated for its spin-doctoring and news management, black arts of which Peter Mandelson was the emblematic figure. The fact that Mandelson has proved himself peculiarly bad at managing his own political career cannot alter the fact that he had, as Donald Macintyre makes clear, an instinctive grasp of the dynamics of the new media-led democracy, a skill certainly needed to pull off the Houdini-like feat of rescuing Labour from the state to which it had sunk in the early 1980s. But far more serious than New Labour's management of the news has been the management of New Labour by tomorrow's possible headlines and the government's resulting lack of any long-term rationale. How, otherwise, can Rawnsley conclude that, after three years in power, it should suddenly dawn on the government that it had made a major strategic mistake by not investing more in health, education and other public services?

The vacuity of the Third Way could hardly be better illustrated. This short-termism feeds on itself. Rawnsley quotes a cabinet member's comment that after three years in power \"it's worse now. What you have to understand is that every day is a panic. We're so neurotic.\" The reason for this is the decline of all the key institutions which used to hold political leaders responsible: the mass party, the cabinet and parliament.

      "bodyText": "Popstars's \"Nasty\" Nigel Lythgoe has got a new job, heading former Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller's TV production company. Mr Lythgoe is currently on secondment from LWT to Planet 24, working on ITV's next big reality show, Survivor. He will join Mr Fuller's outfit, 19 TV, when he finishes work in the summer. His brief will include overseeing Popstars follow-up Pop Idol, which is to be co-produced for ITV with Pearson TV. Mr Lythgoe will not be returning to his LWT job as controller of entertainment. During six years at LWT he established a reputation as an old-style ITV entertainment baron, overseeing a slate of shows, including Blind Date and Gladiators, regarded as unfashionable by the critics, no matter how popular. But Mr Lythgoe reinvented himself with his role as Popstars's Nasty Nigel, carving out a place at the forefront of the high-concept, reality entertainment format boom. He cemented this position by landing the job executive producing Survivor, the Planet 24 reality format that proved such a hit in the US last summer. Mr Lythgoe is currently on location in Borneo working on Survivor, which pits a group of contestants against each other in a Big Brother-style battle for a cash prize. LWT is understood to have demanded up to \u00a3200,000 in compensation from Planet 24 parent company Carlton to cover Mr Lythgoe's salary for the six-month secondment. His LWT responsibilities will be shared between head of entertainment Bob Massie and head of production Jane Honeycombe.

      "body": "<p>I remember everything about my midwife - her name, her face, the things she told me. She saw me at my GP's practice throughout my pregnancy and visited every day for 10 days after I returned home with my new daughter. She made my first days with my first born a joy. </p> <p>That was eight years ago and the midwife has moved on. Three weeks ago, I gave birth to twins in the same London teaching hospital, under the same practice. But this second tale of maternity care is not so happy. In less than a decade, the service I took for granted for my first born had collapsed. There is a severe shortage of midwives; two out of three maternity units are understaffed and London hospitals in particular have problems with recruitment. </p> <p>Last week, a survey of 2,000 recent mothers by the online magazine Mother &amp; Baby revealed that most were dissatisfied with the care they received, less than half would be happy to return to the same hospital due to lack of support, and half said they received poor post-natal care at home. Only 4% had the same midwife for antenatal appointments and the birth. \"Chronically overstretched maternity staff simply don't have the time to provide the sort of quality care pregnant women expect,\" says Sarah Stone, editor of Mother &amp; Baby. \"Many women feel as if they have gone through a conveyor-belt birth experience.\" </p> <p>My experience in the labour ward was exemplary. But the moment I was wheeled out of the delivery room and into the packed post-natal ward, it was as if I was being taken from a place where I was the centre of attention to a place where I had to be processed and moved on. The conveyor belt had begun to roll. </p> <p>It began with my inability to get breakfast. I had been in the ward for less than two hours and my legs were still dead from the epidural. I was awake (I had no choice - the fluorescent lights were on and the curtains around my bed drawn back) and very, very hungry. I had not eaten since breakfast the previous day. </p> <p>Breakfast was self-service. I watched as the trolley of catering- sized cereal boxes, sliced white bread and mini packets of Flora was wheeled up the centre of the ward. Legless, I called out from my metal-barred bed, \"Can I have some cornflakes please?\" My cries were drowned out by the baby opposite, who had an infection which wouldn't let him (or us) sleep. The trolley wheeled on past. My thirst was terrible. When a cleaner with a giant mop started wiping under my bed, I asked her if she could kindly get me some water. She took the empty plastic jug from my bedside cabinet, and trotted off to fill it. I never saw her or the jug again. </p> <p>I was later told it was all to do with the shift change, which coincided with breakfast in the morning and a busy visiting time in the evening. I learned to dread the shift change. If both babies started crying uncontrollably, if I developed a raging thirst while trying to breastfeed, if I needed to go to the toilet, and it happened to coincide with the shift change, then there was no help at hand. The midwives were swapping notes about us somewhere but could not be found on the ward. </p> <p>The continual change of staff was confusing. When one of my babies wouldn't breastfeed, I was told to feed him from a cup. The next day, a different midwife recommended a bottle or he would lose too much weight. The next day, another midwife said if I gave him a bottle he would never take the breast, so I had to starve him into submission. The following day, that decision was overturned by the next change of staff. </p> <p>Midwives themselves are not to blame (80% of those surveyed found them \"sympathetic and kind\"). They are given an unenviable number of roles to play in the postnatal ward. As well as carrying out rigorous medical checks of mother and child, they are expected to inform and educate. </p> <p>During my three days in hospital, I accumulated no less than six copies of the same full-colour glossy brochure on breastfeeding. Midwives are instructed to promote this method of feeding above all others. The only problem was, through no choice of my own, one of the twins was being bottlefed. It wasn't until two weeks later, when the health visitor (a former midwife who left because of the horrendous hours) came to my home, that I received my first bottle-feeding brochure. </p> <p>In black and white, it looked like something from the 50s, dated and unattractive. Yet it contained vital information on sterilisation of feeding equipment - information that I should have surely received far earlier. And not only me; despite the emphasis on \"breast is best\", the vast majority of women in my ward pulled out their ready-made bottles, handing their new-born over to a visiting grandmother. Half of the women in the survey said that, despite trying, breast-feeding didn't work out for them either. </p> <p>But perhaps, lying behind the disillusionment with maternity care, is a relationship that is inevitably and unavoidably one sided. You never forget the face or name of the woman who helped to deliver your child. Yet, within hours, she will have forgotten yours. It is, therefore, a relationship in which the mother is bound to feel abandoned. For us, it's a time of overpowering importance, when our emotions are at their most raw. For the midwife, it's just a job. </p> <p>In my ward, the conflict between the expectations of the women in the beds and those pacing the wards was acute. One midwife kept complaining about being tired from working 12-hour shifts. This is not an unreasonable complaint. But we mothers showed no sympathy. What was this midwife moaning on about, when we had been up all night, and would count three hours sleep at a time as a luxury? When the ward manager unplugged the patients' phone, saying staff didn't have time to keep answering it, mutters rippled through the mothers, stranded in bed by caesarean sections and catheters. Calls from family and friends were vital to us. It was as if we were being punished for not rising sooner from our post-natal rest. </p> <p>At home, the care was no less cursory. My GP practice's midwife no longer makes post-natal home visits; she has too many other clinics to cover. I saw three different midwives over two weeks. They came every four to five days, and it was only so frequently because the baby girl was a bit jaundiced. One weighed the babies with their clothes on; a week later, another weighed them naked, so comparing the weights became meaningless. Another asked me if I had been back for my hospital appointment yet, confusing me with someone else. It is hardly surprising. She had never met me before, and never would again. I was just another mother and baby to visit that day. </p> <p>\"Pressures on the health service mean there is little consistency in antenatal, birth and postnatal care, and some mums-to-be are lucky to see the same midwife twice,\" says Stone. \"The majority of pregnant women do not have the opportunity to build a trusting relationship with a midwife. Instead, most are filtered through a sea of different faces.\" </p> <p>Midwives are no happier than mothers with the system. On my post natal ward, they complained of impossibly long and erratic hours, making parenting impossible. Ironically, many midwives change profession when they have children. The government is promising to address this haemorrhaging with a recruitment drive. By 2004, the NHS plans to have 20,000 more nursing staff, although it is not clear how many of those will be midwives. </p> <p>If I did not have such strong, fond memories of my first child's birth, perhaps this time around would not seem such a cold, cynical encounter. But it does. I did not feel cared for; I felt as if having a baby was burden too much for the health service to bear. I know it can and has been otherwise. To restore a service to what it was almost a decade ago does not seem an exorbitant demand. After all, where better to get it right than from birth.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Last week a friend working in Kenya explained Britain's foot and mouth policy to a Maasai cattle herder. The nomad found our approach horrifying and hilarious in equal measure. His first objection was that all cattle belong to the Maasai, and no one had asked their permission. Then he wanted to know why Britain found it so hard to suppress a disease which the Maasai had learnt to control generations ago. When my friend explained that we were hoping to start selling our meat abroad once more, he was mystified: \"Why on earth would you want to do that?\" he asked. This is a good question, which we in Britain have so far failed to ask, let alone to answer.</p> <p>Yesterday, the Times suggested that our meat exports are worth \"up to \u00a31bn a year\". As usual, the paper of record seems to be making it up as it goes along. The Ministry of Agriculture's figures for last year show that we exported \u00a3310m worth of cattle, pigs and sheep to the European Union, and next to nothing elsewhere. Interestingly, this figure represents a decline of 39% from 1999. If this trend continues, our exports will dwindle to zero in three years' time. But it won't continue. Foot and mouth, for most foreign buyers, is the final straw, confirming their well-founded suspicion that our farming is unsafe. There is no guarantee that exports will resume at all when the UK is declared free from disease.</p> <p>Most of our livestock sales, moreover, are subsidised, by both headage and export payments. The truckers who drive them around are also state assisted, as their fuel and road taxes now pay only some 80% of the costs they impose on the Exchequer. Livestock sales, in other words, are likely to cost the country more than they make.</p> <p>So parts of the countryside have been declared off limits, the tourist industry has been all but obliterated, rare breeds have been slaughtered and hundreds of businesses have been closed to protect an industry which is worth not \u00a31bn a year, not \u00a3570m as ministers have claimed, not even the \u00a3310m that Maff figures show, but, in all probability, less than nothing.</p> <p>Surely then, there must be other reasons for the government's declaration of war with Britain's sheep? One compelling argument is that Europe insists we stamp out the disease. But the European rules - which arose, anyway, from the British insistence on curtailing foot and mouth through mass slaughter - are designed to protect trade between member states. Were we to abandon our fantasy animal exports, then the requirement would become obsolete.</p> <p>Foot and mouth disease does have implications for animal welfare. In extreme cases, livestock suffer gravely from the lesions on their mouths and feet. But we can put down animals in this condition without having to slaughter the entire herd, let alone the healthy stock on surrounding farms. Indeed, one of the many idiocies of the mass slaughter programme is that animals in distress are reached no faster than animals which aren't suffering at all: it prolongs pain, rather than relieving it. The selective culling of badly infected stock, moreover, is likely to lead to an improvement in disease resistance, which many of our over-developed new breeds are now woefully lacking. Any suffering caused by foot and mouth would surely be offset by terminating the cruel and unnecessary live transport of animals to other countries.</p> <p>There is no doubt that foot and mouth will also lead to reduced yields of milk and meat, but it's hard to understand why this should be considered a problem. Thanks to overproduction, the EU has introduced a quota system which ensures that every time we buy a pint of milk, we have to pay two pence over the market price.</p> <p>The benefits of endemic foot and mouth, by contrast, must surely be obvious. It would encourage farmers to develop local markets for their produce, which is the only strategy which makes both economic and environmental sense. It would reduce the number of lorries on the roads. It would persuade breeders to phase out strains with poor resistance to disease and inherent welfare problems, and return to hardier types which don't require such intensive management.</p> <p>So the government's decision to start vaccinating livestock should be opposed, on the grounds that it might eliminate foot and mouth from Britain.

      "bodyText": "Last week a friend working in Kenya explained Britain's foot and mouth policy to a Maasai cattle herder. The nomad found our approach horrifying and hilarious in equal measure. His first objection was that all cattle belong to the Maasai, and no one had asked their permission. Then he wanted to know why Britain found it so hard to suppress a disease which the Maasai had learnt to control generations ago. When my friend explained that we were hoping to start selling our meat abroad once more, he was mystified: \"Why on earth would you want to do that?\" he asked. This is a good question, which we in Britain have so far failed to ask, let alone to answer. Yesterday, the Times suggested that our meat exports are worth \"up to \u00a31bn a year\". As usual, the paper of record seems to be making it up as it goes along. The Ministry of Agriculture's figures for last year show that we exported \u00a3310m worth of cattle, pigs and sheep to the European Union, and next to nothing elsewhere. Interestingly, this figure represents a decline of 39% from 1999. If this trend continues, our exports will dwindle to zero in three years' time. But it won't continue. Foot and mouth, for most foreign buyers, is the final straw, confirming their well-founded suspicion that our farming is unsafe. There is no guarantee that exports will resume at all when the UK is declared free from disease. Most of our livestock sales, moreover, are subsidised, by both headage and export payments. The truckers who drive them around are also state assisted, as their fuel and road taxes now pay only some 80% of the costs they impose on the Exchequer. Livestock sales, in other words, are likely to cost the country more than they make. So parts of the countryside have been declared off limits, the tourist industry has been all but obliterated, rare breeds have been slaughtered and hundreds of businesses have been closed to protect an industry which is worth not \u00a31bn a year, not \u00a3570m as ministers have claimed, not even the \u00a3310m that Maff figures show, but, in all probability, less than nothing. Surely then, there must be other reasons for the government's declaration of war with Britain's sheep? One compelling argument is that Europe insists we stamp out the disease. But the European rules - which arose, anyway, from the British insistence on curtailing foot and mouth through mass slaughter - are designed to protect trade between member states. Were we to abandon our fantasy animal exports, then the requirement would become obsolete. Foot and mouth disease does have implications for animal welfare. In extreme cases, livestock suffer gravely from the lesions on their mouths and feet. But we can put down animals in this condition without having to slaughter the entire herd, let alone the healthy stock on surrounding farms. Indeed, one of the many idiocies of the mass slaughter programme is that animals in distress are reached no faster than animals which aren't suffering at all: it prolongs pain, rather than relieving it. The selective culling of badly infected stock, moreover, is likely to lead to an improvement in disease resistance, which many of our over-developed new breeds are now woefully lacking. Any suffering caused by foot and mouth would surely be offset by terminating the cruel and unnecessary live transport of animals to other countries. There is no doubt that foot and mouth will also lead to reduced yields of milk and meat, but it's hard to understand why this should be considered a problem. Thanks to overproduction, the EU has introduced a quota system which ensures that every time we buy a pint of milk, we have to pay two pence over the market price. The benefits of endemic foot and mouth, by contrast, must surely be obvious. It would encourage farmers to develop local markets for their produce, which is the only strategy which makes both economic and environmental sense. It would reduce the number of lorries on the roads. It would persuade breeders to phase out strains with poor resistance to disease and inherent welfare problems, and return to hardier types which don't require such intensive management. So the government's decision to start vaccinating livestock should be opposed, on the grounds that it might eliminate foot and mouth from Britain. The ministry should continue to spread the disease around as rapidly as possible, by pursuing a slaughter programme it doesn't have the capacity to implement, leaving piles of rotting animals strewn around the countryside, then setting fire to them so that the virus is lifted into the jetstream and widely dispersed. If the vaccination programme is successful, then, as an urgent strategic priority, the government should reinfect the country forthwith. What's going on?

They watched sheep being slaughtered with stun guns, then bulldozed into trenches beside hundreds of diseased carcasses.</p> <p>As General Jackson was last seen heading the forces in Kosovo, fears were sparked that the crisis was now beginning to escalate out of control. But Mr Hoon said he was pleased with the army's work, and that resources were not an issue. \"It is not an easy job, it is not a pleasant job,\" he added, saying General Jackson was in Cumbria as the head of the land forces, not as a crisis call.</p> <p>General Jackson said: \"It is a rather different sort of conflict. It is not one involving human beings who cannot get on with each other, it is a very tragic disease in our own country. Nobody likes to see death and it is just an awful waste. Seeing the utter waste is very sad.\"</p> <p>Up to 2,000 healthy animals were slaughtered at the burial pit yesterday, alongside 8,000 or so decomposing carcasses that were pushed from dumper trucks into the graves.</p> <p>The first load of healthy animals arrived just before 10am. Whimpering sheep poked their noses out of slits in the packed trailers as they were driven over disinfected straw bales. Supervised by two Ministry of Agriculture vets, the sheep were herded, around 40 at a time, into metal pens on the edge of the graves.</p> <p>The animals were then herded to a patch of concrete covered by a plastic tarpaulin where they each received an electric bolt through the head. The diggers scooped up the carcasses and then dumped them into the pits.</p> <p>The army calmed fears by the RSPCA that animals were not being killed properly and that some were even being buried alive. Brigadier Alex Birtwhistle, head of the military operation in Cumbria, said that the RSPCA could enter the site at any time without giving prior warning.</p> <p>At least 4,000 apparently healthy livestock were culled at Carlisle abattoir yesterday and, faced with growing numbers of dead cows littering Cumbrian fields, the army said that it was preparing the biggest pyre that the country had seen.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email \">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth roundup</a><br></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: increase in cases</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,464617,00.html\">The issue explained: Vaccination</a><br><a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained: Pigswill</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list \">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br></p> <p><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463602,00.html\">26.03.2001: Countrytown blues</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html \">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464340,00.html\">28.03.2001: New plan for firewall vaccination</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464312,00.html\">28.03.2001: Illegal meat trail leads to infected countries</a> <br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464283,00.html\">28.03.2001: 'They said nothing could be done'</a> <br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464337,00.html\">28.03.2001: Ministers failed to heed warnings, experts say</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463679,00.html\">27.03.2001, Matthew Engel: Fiddling facts while we burn</a></p> <p><b>Farmer's diary</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464259,00.html\">28.03.2001: On the farm</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guides</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>More on the countryside in crisis</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463746,00.html\">27.03.2001: Hard times</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive: foot and mouth in 1967</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463588,00.html\">28.11.1967, leader: indecision on foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463571,00.html\">18.11.1967: 'Slaughter must seem a cruel remedy'</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463578,00.html\"> 16.11.1967: Foot and mouth may cost agriculture more than \u00a312m</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463596,00.html\">11.11.1967: Emigrant flights to Australia stopped by foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463559,00.html\">01.11.1967: It is cheaper to kill than to prevent cattle disease</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html \">Computerised image of the virus</a><br></p> <p><b>Cartoons</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464422,00.html \">Steve Bell on how pigs will fly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,463874,00.html \">Steve Bell on Hague going over the top</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681 \">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/ \">BSE</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html \">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>NetNotes</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs -

General Jackson said: \"It is a rather different sort of conflict. It is not one involving human beings who cannot get on with each other, it is a very tragic disease in our own country. Nobody likes to see death and it is just an awful waste. Seeing the utter waste is very sad.\" Up to 2,000 healthy animals were slaughtered at the burial pit yesterday, alongside 8,000 or so decomposing carcasses that were pushed from dumper trucks into the graves. The first load of healthy animals arrived just before 10am. Whimpering sheep poked their noses out of slits in the packed trailers as they were driven over disinfected straw bales. Supervised by two Ministry of Agriculture vets, the sheep were herded, around 40 at a time, into metal pens on the edge of the graves. The animals were then herded to a patch of concrete covered by a plastic tarpaulin where they each received an electric bolt through the head. The diggers scooped up the carcasses and then dumped them into the pits. The army calmed fears by the RSPCA that animals were not being killed properly and that some were even being buried alive. Brigadier Alex Birtwhistle, head of the military operation in Cumbria, said that the RSPCA could enter the site at any time without giving prior warning. At least 4,000 apparently healthy livestock were culled at Carlisle abattoir yesterday and, faced with growing numbers of dead cows littering Cumbrian fields, the army said that it was preparing the biggest pyre that the country had seen.

But the fact that a group of airlines, including BA, has 46% of the shares - with the possibility that it may one day gain majority control - raises a potential conflict of interest. It is not just that overseas airlines feel they may be discriminated against. The problem is that in future the board of the new company may want to do something (like cutting down the number of flights or upping capital investment) that goes against the interests of the member companies that control it. What happens then? Situations like this and the cost increases of the tube and the rail link are the predictable result of ill-thought out schemes that constantly change as they come up against tough private sector negotiators. The Treasury's plans for the London tube will need a miracle to work properly.</p>",

But the fact that a group of airlines, including BA, has 46% of the shares - with the possibility that it may one day gain majority control - raises a potential conflict of interest. It is not just that overseas airlines feel they may be discriminated against. The problem is that in future the board of the new company may want to do something (like cutting down the number of flights or upping capital investment) that goes against the interests of the member companies that control it. What happens then? Situations like this and the cost increases of the tube and the rail link are the predictable result of ill-thought out schemes that constantly change as they come up against tough private sector negotiators. The Treasury's plans for the London tube will need a miracle to work properly.",

Also because he published an essay called Politics and the English Language which ought to be learned by heart by everyone who goes into political journalism.

Independent of what?\" Obedient to his advice, I consult the briefing notes for this week's debate, which tells me that the Independent Supervisory Authority for Hunting (ISAH), in which Lady M invests so much faith, was established at the end of 1999, and that the members of the authority are its chairman (who is Sir Ronald Waterhouse QC), the chairman of the Countryside Alliance's hunting committee and the chairmen of the various hunting associations. These are: the Masters of Foxhounds Association, Central Committee of Fell Packs, Federation of Welsh Packs, Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles, Masters of Basset Hounds Association, National Coursing Club, Association of Lurcher Clubs, Master of Deer Hounds Association, Masters of Mink Hounds Associations and National Working Terrier Federation. Independent of whom? Of Big Brother government, certainly. But of the hunting lobby? George Orwell's ghost is not too sure about that.</p> <p>When this list was read out by Lord Phillips of Sudbury in the debate there were protests from pro-hunting peers, with Lady Mallalieu to the fore. Only one member of the commission which runs ISAH's affairs, she said, had any connection with hunting. Well, maybe. But if I catch him correctly, George Orwell is saying: always, when you see the report of some committee or commission, ask: who recruited these people?

Even so, I think the list of the organisations which make up the ISAH underline the wise words of the Daily Telegraph's environment correspondent when this organisation was set up.

They would lose their disease-free status on world markets, since vaccinated animals carry similar antibodies to those infected with the disease.

The smarmy politician, like the wheeler-dealer at the centre of squalor in the Labour party in Leicester East, momentarily becomes less significant than the junior minister at the Foreign Office, whose performance in his job is termed \"deeply regrettable\" by the Commons select committee on foreign affairs. But this time the charge is not justified. The Tories are calling it the most devastating attack ever made by a committee on a serving minister. It helpfully guides us, instead, towards three misperceptions about Labour's conduct of foreign policy. Let us get them out of the way, in ascending order of importance, before the election.</p> <p>First, there does not need to be a junior minister with responsibility for the Balkans, and he does not need to go there. The job is as absurd as the committee's judgment is ritualistic. The MPs seared Vaz for his ignorance and his absence, as if there was anything he could do to affect a policy that is entirely out of his hands. The Balkans is big stuff, which Mr Cook has rightly taken under his personal control, with the prime minister close alongside. The whole of policy, moreover, is done collectively inside the European Union. For the committee to remark that the EU commissioner, Chris Patten, has been to the Balkans seven times while minister Vaz hasn't gone near the place is a reproach based on the premise that empty ceremonial remains at the heart of political accountability.</p> <p>Which perhaps is a mirror of the committee's own role. To the over-stretched officials and military people trying to make a useful difference in Kosovo and the rest of the region, the only thing more irritating than a visit from a token British minister was surely the collective descent upon them, requiring to be watered and chaperoned, of a parliamentary committee whose subsequent report throws little more light on Balkans policy than many journalists have done before. The luckless Vaz, with his meaningless Balkan label, got caught up in the committee's own empty vanities.</p> <p>Second, though, his proper role as minister for Europe has been misconceived in a different way. This is not his fault, nor parliament's, but the government's. Most countries have ministers with that title, and many of these make serious contributions to thinking about the EU. They are often politicians to be reckoned with. In both Germany and France, the Europe ministers have a standing that entitles them to be heard, with opinions that sometimes disagree with their superiors'.</p> <p>Mr Blair has got through Europe ministers at the rate of one a year. Literally no job in the whole of government has come closer to being treated as a trash-can. The one occupant with the qualifications to fill it, Joyce Quin, was quickly moved on. The government thus accumulates little collective memory, or cultural affinity, for the kind of networking that is second nature to European politicians. Even harder than getting ministers to go to the Balkans is interesting them in the much more useful function of attending informal European get-togethers. Not long ago, at the annual Bertelsmann Foundation conference in Berlin, attended by Chancellor Schr\u00f6der and President Prodi, and several foreign ministers, as well as a number of presidents from central Europe, the best Britain could field was a Conservative baroness. The government voice for the British interest simply wasn't heard.</p> <p>This is a habitual British pattern, probably worse under Labour than the Tories. Since Peter Mandelson left office, there hasn't been a single leading Labour figure willing to do anything abroad which his department doesn't tell him he has to do. We need a Europe minister liberated to take the task of intelligent networking seriously, something Blair and Cook, in thrall to hierarchies of control, do not encourage. That person Keith Vaz will never be.</p> <p>Third, though, Cook has become on the whole an excellent foreign secretary. His low reputation with his political enemies and several newspapers is the biggest misperception at the end of these four years, owing a lot to the kind of vicious, personalised triviality which can endure so much longer here than in more mature societies.</p> <p>Apart from the major misfortune in his private life, Cook made one calamitous error at the start of his term, which was to promise an ethical dimension to his foreign policy in terms that have led to him being ethically faulted ever since. It was an honourable but half-baked claim, hoisting to prominence the false assumption that his predecessors had always been unethical and carrying the implication that he, a principled foreign secretary, would address the harshness of the world from a more elevated position. With the exception of a slight improvement in the European rules for arms sales, this he has naturally failed to do.</p> <p>But he is now admired in quarters we seldom hear about. The Foreign Office itself, many of whose top people detested his posturing at the start, has succumbed to his intellectual swiftness. Some officials still reflect bitterly on the responsibility which, as they see it, he failed to take for the Sandline affair in Sierra Leone, instead dumping them in the dirt. But his thorough grasp of many issues now overshadows his notorious reluctance to carry half-a-dozen red boxes home at night.</p> <p>He has likewise made friends in the European Union. For two years, he took no interest in the EU and made little impact on British policy there. Now he is an important player. When Mr Blair had to leave last week's Stockholm summit early, he could rely not only on Cook playing the British hand as he would have done but - a privilege not granted to many foreign ministers - on the Schr\u00f6ders and Chiracs accepting him at the table without demur. The friends of Mr Blair now say the leader cannot do without his foreign secretary. Of all top ministers, he has the closest, least troubled working relationship of any with the prime minister.</p> <p>Though he, too, was tritely criticised by the select committee for not visiting the Balkans, it is there, in his own eyes, that he has earned the greatest credit. His role was less spectacular than Joschka Fischer's. He didn't, like the German foreign minister, put his political life on the line to persuade his party of the case for defending Kosovo against ethnic purging by the Serbs. But alongside Blair, from a different wing of old Labour, he can take some credit for the removal of Slobodan Milosevic from power. In the scales that measure ethical foreign policy with a political purpose, this weighs in as a not inconsiderable item.</p> <p>After the election, I think Keith Vaz will no longer be minister for Europe, or the Balkans.

It says: \"In the last quarter of the 20th century, much of that industrial base, and the employment that accompanied it, was decimated by successive economic recession, and intensive competition from increasingly global markets.\" It was announced yesterday that the redevelopment of the rundown Cardroom estate - described by a resident as like Beirut - will be led by Urban Splash, a company which has given new life to mills and other industrial buildings in Manchester and Liverpool. In a recent Guardian debate, Urban Splash's chairman, Tom Bloxham, expressed concern that the wealth of booming Manchester was not trickling out from the centre to poorer neighbourhoods. The firm's managing director, Jonathan Falkingham, said yesterday the Cardroom estate was a challenge: \"But it's also an opportunity. We have a vision for the estate which will create a 21st century residential community that is both inclusive and sustainable.\" The NEM plan also includes a partnership with a private developer to construct, on a 160-hectare site, a business park forecast to create 9,000 jobs. Shops, restaurants, a market hall, hotel and homes are planned, and Asda Wal-Mart plans to build a superstore to be ready by 2002. The banks of the Ashton canal are being improved to create a walking and cycling route from the city centre to the stadium.",

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Jack Straw, has overruled the prisons minister, Paul Boateng, in a Home Office clash over how to keep discipline inside youth jails, according to Whitehall papers leaked to the Guardian. Mr Boateng objected to a more liberal approach now being introduced of releasing early those juveniles who behaved well, saying it would lead to suggestions that the prison service was rewarding them with reduced sentences as the only way to get them to behave. The approach also brought a warning from the director-general of prisons, Martin Narey, about whether he could make it work. But Mr Straw rejected Mr Boateng's criticism and backed demands from Lord Warner, head of the youth justice board, for a more liberal use of the carrot rather than the stick. The options under the incentive scheme to enforce discipline among the more troublesome teenagers include rewarding good behaviour with early release, in-cell television and allowing them more trips home during their sentence. The clash between liberal and hardline approaches at the highest levels of the Home Office took place after prison governors complained that the new juvenile detention and training orders did not give them the power to add extra days to a sentence for bad behaviour. A leaked letter from Mr Narey to Mr Straw of February 12 makes clear that the home secretary rejected the option of new legislation to restore the punishment power of governors for juveniles under 18. \"In consideration of this I wanted to be open about how I will be encouraging governors to use the incentive of early release to encourage good order. You will remember that at a recent bilateral Paul Boateng expressed some concern about that,\" Mr Narey wrote, going on to make clear that he recognised some of the prison minister's concerns. He said most young offenders' institutions were coping well, but there was a problem in three jails where the over 18s, who could be punished with extra days, were held alongside the under 18s, who could not. Mr Narey also said the scheme was in danger of undermining the anti-drugs policy, which has so far proved successful because a positive drug test inevitably led to extra days on the sentence. \"But a juvenile who tests positive for drugs can have no such sanction imposed.\" He said nothing could be done about teenage offenders who smashed up their cells. If governors reported the matter to police, the courts had no custodial sanction because \"the maximum available sentence for criminal damage under \u00a35,000 is a three month period in custody, and the detention and training order [DTO] is a minimum of four months. \"We are doing everything we can to manage this and trying to make the system work. I think we can.

The landmark judgment could lead to the release of dozens of mentally disordered offenders from Broadmoor and other high security hospitals in the UK. Three appeal court judges, led by the master of the rolls, Lord Phillips, declared that two sections of the Mental Health Act 1983 were incompatible with the European convention on human rights. The ruling is the first \"declaration of incompatibility\" to be made by the appeal court since judges received the right last October, as the Human Rights Act came into force, to declare acts of parliament incompatible with the convention. The only previous declaration, made by the high court in December, threw the planning laws into disarray. The law lords are now considering overturning the declaration. In yesterday's case a person with paranoid schizophrenia, detained in Broadmoor for the manslaughter of a fellow hostel resident in 1988, successfully challenged procedures under which psychiatric patients detained against their will can gain release. Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, the solicitor for the patient, who was named only as H, said: \"This ruling will force the government to change the law. It means that all the patients who are now detained without strong evidence will be entitled to discharge.\" The judges ruled that sections 72 and 73 of the Mental Health Act, which say how mental health review tribunals should decide on the release of patients, breached article five of the European convention - the right to liberty. While patients could be admitted to hospital only if doctors decided they needed to be detained, when it came to their release the burden of proof was on the patients to prove they no longer needed to be detained. This \"reverse burden of proof\" breached the convention, the judges ruled. A psychiatrist at Broadmoor told the tribunal that H was doing well on medication and might live in a specialised hostel.

Both psychiatrists said H did not satisfy the conditions necessary for continued detention under the Mental Health Act. But the tribunal concluded in December 1999 that H still exhibited symptoms of his illness (hearing voices), would not continue with his medication, and needed to be kept in hospital for his own safety. A high court judge rejected H's application for judicial review of the tribunal's decision last September, and refused to hear arguments based on the Human Rights Act. But the appeal court granted permission in December for those points to be argued on appeal.

But Counihan, who has died aged 83, was a man of many talents and wide interests, who in his retirement from the BBC became editor of the Catholic Herald. </p> <p>Born in north London, he went to school at St Ignatius' College. His father, a senior executive with London Transport, wanted him to have a \"sensible\" career, but Dan wanted to be an artist. He went to Hornsey Art School, paying his way by designing fireplaces for a company - a job he hated. During the second world war he was employed by the Ministry of Information and served with the army in Italy, rising to the rank of major. He was present at the Anzio landings and at the liberation of Rome. His last job was as head of the news division for Venezia-Giulia, based at Trieste. His tasks included the investigation of Axis atrocities and the editing of an army newspaper. </p> <p>Such appropriate wartime experience led him to being recruited into the BBC as a foreign correspondent. For most of his broadcasting career, he was based in London with the title of diplomatic correspondent. He flew out to cover trouble spots and reported from all parts of the world. From the Congo and Vietnam, he sent despatches on atrocities that combined detachment with controlled passion. Three of his reports were published in the BBC's 1995 anthology, From Our Own Correspondent: the first 40 years. </p> <p>He was the BBC's Moscow correspondent until expulsion as part of a diplomatic tit-for-tat in 1971. He then became first Commonwealth correspondent and lastly court correspondent. In the latter role he accompanied the Queen on overseas visits. His previous BBC assignments gave his reporting a width and a depth, and an appreciation of the Queen as head of the Commonwealth. </p> <p>He had married, in 1939, Joan, the daughter of W Douglas Newton, the Catholic writer and journalist, who had also been a court correspondent, accompanying the then Prince of Wales on a tour of the US and Canada in the 1920s. A growing family - eight children in all - obliged Dan to supplement his income from the BBC with other jobs. He wrote regularly for John O'London's Weekly and The Tablet. </p> <p>A lifelong interest was children's literature, and he reviewed children's books for the Times Literary Supplement. In spite of frequent absences, he cherished his home life, thought the world of his children and saw life through their eyes. One daughter recalls how, when a hamper of children's books arrived before Christmas, Dan would distribute these to his children and tell them to read them critically. He based his reviews on their insights. </p> <p>He himself wrote a children's story, Unicorn Magic, published by Chatto and Windus in 1953. In this tale, children are able to step into an artist's canvas and become part of the world of the painter's imagination. Recent critics have seen this story of charm and magic as a precursor of the Harry Potter books. But he wrote also for adults. His Royal Progress was published to mark the Silver Jubilee in 1977. </p> <p>Dan retired from the BBC in 1975 and was, in the early 1980s, editor of the Catholic Herald. By then, he was in his 60s and played a paternal role in encouraging and developing the talents of younger writers and journalists such as Christopher Howse, Jonathan Petre and Declan Donnellan.

      "body": "<p>Muriel Young, who has died at the age of 72, was a children's television presenter in the early days of ITV as the lively Aunty Mu, who appeared with her disreputable owl accomplice, Ollie Beak. </p> <p>Born in County Durham, and always keeping a hint of its accent, Muriel aspired originally to be an actress, and thanks to an uncle in the profession made a start in repertory at Henley-on-Thames, followed by roles at the little Gateway Theatre in London. Later, she had parts in two Sidney Gilliat movies of the early 1950s, The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan and The Constant Husband. Between whiles she worked as a photographer's model, tried her hand as a glass-painter, and even trained as a dental nurse, just in case. </p> <p>It was in pursuit of her acting career that, in 1955, she applied to one of the pioneer commercial television contractors, Associated-Rediffusion, who had eight months in which to organise themselves, find studios, devise programmes and hire staff before the launch in September. By mistake, Muriel went along to an audition for announcers instead of the one for actors. She was hired on the spot, and was the announcer on opening night, when there weren't enough commercials to fill the commercial breaks and a good deal of improvisation was called for. </p> <p>As ITV expanded into the regions, she worked as presenter and interviewer on Granada's People and Places in the north and Southern TV's Day by Day from Southampton; but it was in children's television for her original employers in London, Associated-Rediffusion, that she found her special niche. Under the relaxed leadership of its first head of children's TV, Peter Willes, a strand of light-hearted, inventive miscellany programmes evolved around the many talents of Wally Whyton, up till then a pop musician with the Vipers skiffle band. </p> <p>It began in 1959 when Small Time, originally a midday programme for under-fives hosted by Susan Spear, was invited to spin off a five o'clock version which might also cater for an older and smarter audience. Muriel Young came in as presenter, Bert Weedon brought along his guitar and Whyton his love of folk music. Small Time already had an endearing glove-puppet character in Pussy Cat Willum, devised and animated by Janet Nicholls. Whyton, who had been to art school, created the truculent Scouse owl Ollie Beak and the dogged dog Fred Barker. Muriel did her best to keep order. </p> <p>Under various titles - Lucky Dip, Tuesday Rendezvous, Five O'Clock Club, Ollie and Fred's Five O'Clock Club and Five O'Clock Funfair - the formula lasted until the re-allotment of ITV contracts in 1968, when Associated-Rediffusion was merged into Thames Television. Muriel Young, who in this period had also been a disc-jockey for Radio Luxembourg, was lured to Granada in an off-screen capacity, to head a new children's department. </p> <p>She devised Clapperboard, a popular cinema programme for younger viewers, and a number of pop music series, including Lift Off (latterly Lift Off with Ayshea) and Get It Together. In the early 1980s, after leaving Granada, she made music programmes for Channel 4. </p> <p>She had married, in 1954, Cyril Coke, a television drama director who also worked for Associated-Rediffusion, and in 1963 gave them a notable critical success with his own adaptation of Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon. He was still going strong in the 1980s with Malice Aforethought, Pride And Prejudice and other major serials, but in 1986 the couple decided to retire to Muriel's homeland and settled into an apartment in Stanhope Castle. She took up painting, and exhibited both locally and in London. Cyril Coke died in 1993. They had no children. </p> <p>And with Wally Whyton's death four years ago, there can be few survivors from the great Five O'Clock days, unless it is the indestructible Ollie Beak, who once wrote to me after what he thought was a bad review and advised me not to walk down Fleet Street bare-headed. </p> <p><strong> Iris Warne writes:</strong> In 1943, Muriel Young was among many young women who joined the ATS and were trained to be special wireless operators. She was posted to Shenley in Hertfordshire after training and became a member of A-Watch. We all worked shifts, taking all the Morse messages sent by SS units in Europe for subsequent decoding at Bletchley. </p> <p>After the war, we members of hut 15 kept close contact: Mu visited my flat and we visited her in Covent Garden, where she lived with her husband, Cyril Coke. </p> <p>She was always pretty, cheerful and good-natured and is fondly remembered by all of us. Mu took her first steps to show business in Shenley, close to the Elstree Studios and subsequently joined ENSA when our operating days were over. We followed her career with interest and mourn her passing. </p> <p>\u0095 Muriel Young, television presenter and producer, born June 19 1928; died March 24 2001</p>",

      "bodyText": "Muriel Young, who has died at the age of 72, was a children's television presenter in the early days of ITV as the lively Aunty Mu, who appeared with her disreputable owl accomplice, Ollie Beak. Born in County Durham, and always keeping a hint of its accent, Muriel aspired originally to be an actress, and thanks to an uncle in the profession made a start in repertory at Henley-on-Thames, followed by roles at the little Gateway Theatre in London. Later, she had parts in two Sidney Gilliat movies of the early 1950s, The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan and The Constant Husband. Between whiles she worked as a photographer's model, tried her hand as a glass-painter, and even trained as a dental nurse, just in case. It was in pursuit of her acting career that, in 1955, she applied to one of the pioneer commercial television contractors, Associated-Rediffusion, who had eight months in which to organise themselves, find studios, devise programmes and hire staff before the launch in September. By mistake, Muriel went along to an audition for announcers instead of the one for actors. She was hired on the spot, and was the announcer on opening night, when there weren't enough commercials to fill the commercial breaks and a good deal of improvisation was called for. As ITV expanded into the regions, she worked as presenter and interviewer on Granada's People and Places in the north and Southern TV's Day by Day from Southampton; but it was in children's television for her original employers in London, Associated-Rediffusion, that she found her special niche. Under the relaxed leadership of its first head of children's TV, Peter Willes, a strand of light-hearted, inventive miscellany programmes evolved around the many talents of Wally Whyton, up till then a pop musician with the Vipers skiffle band. It began in 1959 when Small Time, originally a midday programme for under-fives hosted by Susan Spear, was invited to spin off a five o'clock version which might also cater for an older and smarter audience. Muriel Young came in as presenter, Bert Weedon brought along his guitar and Whyton his love of folk music. Small Time already had an endearing glove-puppet character in Pussy Cat Willum, devised and animated by Janet Nicholls. Whyton, who had been to art school, created the truculent Scouse owl Ollie Beak and the dogged dog Fred Barker. Muriel did her best to keep order. Under various titles - Lucky Dip, Tuesday Rendezvous, Five O'Clock Club, Ollie and Fred's Five O'Clock Club and Five O'Clock Funfair - the formula lasted until the re-allotment of ITV contracts in 1968, when Associated-Rediffusion was merged into Thames Television. Muriel Young, who in this period had also been a disc-jockey for Radio Luxembourg, was lured to Granada in an off-screen capacity, to head a new children's department. She devised Clapperboard, a popular cinema programme for younger viewers, and a number of pop music series, including Lift Off (latterly Lift Off with Ayshea) and Get It Together. In the early 1980s, after leaving Granada, she made music programmes for Channel 4. She had married, in 1954, Cyril Coke, a television drama director who also worked for Associated-Rediffusion, and in 1963 gave them a notable critical success with his own adaptation of Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon. He was still going strong in the 1980s with Malice Aforethought, Pride And Prejudice and other major serials, but in 1986 the couple decided to retire to Muriel's homeland and settled into an apartment in Stanhope Castle. She took up painting, and exhibited both locally and in London. Cyril Coke died in 1993. They had no children. And with Wally Whyton's death four years ago, there can be few survivors from the great Five O'Clock days, unless it is the indestructible Ollie Beak, who once wrote to me after what he thought was a bad review and advised me not to walk down Fleet Street bare-headed. Iris Warne writes: In 1943, Muriel Young was among many young women who joined the ATS and were trained to be special wireless operators. She was posted to Shenley in Hertfordshire after training and became a member of A-Watch. We all worked shifts, taking all the Morse messages sent by SS units in Europe for subsequent decoding at Bletchley. After the war, we members of hut 15 kept close contact: Mu visited my flat and we visited her in Covent Garden, where she lived with her husband, Cyril Coke. She was always pretty, cheerful and good-natured and is fondly remembered by all of us. Mu took her first steps to show business in Shenley, close to the Elstree Studios and subsequently joined ENSA when our operating days were over. We followed her career with interest and mourn her passing. \u0095 Muriel Young, television presenter and producer, born June 19 1928; died March 24 2001",

Labour's poll, taken at the weekend, showed it ahead on every policy except immigration and asylum. The party's already rock-solid lead on economic competence had risen.</p> <p>Election strategists who met in Downing Street yesterday believe that Mr Blair will face charges of insensitivity for the first two or three days of the campaign, but can ride out the charge.</p> <p>The environment minister, Michael Meacher, also gave the first public clue of how Labour will simultaneously fight an election and the spread of foot and mouth. He told MPs the 26-strong rural task force would continue to meet during the election and promised that any largesse to farmers would \"not be done in a political way\".</p> <p>The main block to the election juggernaut was advice from some senior Labour MPs that William Hague now privately favours a May 3 election in the belief that the crisis has knocked the sheen off Mr Blair.</p> <p>Despite the Tories' formal opposition to a May 3 poll, shadow cabinet members now believe that it provides the best chance to trim Labour's Commons majority to well below 100. One Tory MP said: \"At last we've got an issue to hang our hat on: competence and opportunism.\"</p> <p>The move to inoculate cattle, inititally in Devon and Cumbria, is expected to be announced today.</p> <p>Nick Brown, the minister of agriculture, who has in effect been sidelined by the prime minister this week, last night met the National Farmers Union leader, Ben Gill, to tell him that the vaccination programme must go ahead. Government sources said farmers' leaders increasingly recognised there was now no alternative to what was once described as the last resort.</p> <p>A European Union veterinary surgeons' meeting in Brussels yesterday gave approval for the vaccinations to start. No fresh domestic legislation is required. Adequate supplies of vaccination are said already to be available in Britain. Once vaccinated the cattle will eventually be slaughtered, but the move buys ministers time and helps create firebreaks.</p> <p>General Sir Mike Jackson, commander of British land forces and a Kosovo war veteran, personally oversaw the start of the mass slaughter in Cumbria. The animals were being buried in a mass grave. But the backlog of sheep waiting to be slaughtered in the county had risen to 140,000, leaving the government far off its target of reducing the wait from identification to slaughter to 24 hours. A total of 41 new cases were announced yesterday, taking the total nationwide to at least 716.</p> <p>The Ministry of Agriculture has now authorised 764,319 animals for slaughter, including 552,550 sheep.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair yesterday paved the way for a general election on May 3 by agreeing to start a vaccination programme of 200,000 cattle as early as this week and by demanding that local councils reopen swaths of the countryside closed at the start of the foot and mouth epidemic. Mr Blair, determined to give the impression that the government will soon have the crisis under control, hopes to see more than 700,000 animals slaughtered by the weekend, with 50 burial sites identified. Labour MPs expect him to go to Buckingham Palace next week after officials told them at a private meeting that the party's polling showed it had a 16-point lead over the Tories. Labour's poll, taken at the weekend, showed it ahead on every policy except immigration and asylum. The party's already rock-solid lead on economic competence had risen. Election strategists who met in Downing Street yesterday believe that Mr Blair will face charges of insensitivity for the first two or three days of the campaign, but can ride out the charge. The environment minister, Michael Meacher, also gave the first public clue of how Labour will simultaneously fight an election and the spread of foot and mouth. He told MPs the 26-strong rural task force would continue to meet during the election and promised that any largesse to farmers would \"not be done in a political way\". The main block to the election juggernaut was advice from some senior Labour MPs that William Hague now privately favours a May 3 election in the belief that the crisis has knocked the sheen off Mr Blair. Despite the Tories' formal opposition to a May 3 poll, shadow cabinet members now believe that it provides the best chance to trim Labour's Commons majority to well below 100. One Tory MP said: \"At last we've got an issue to hang our hat on: competence and opportunism.\" The move to inoculate cattle, inititally in Devon and Cumbria, is expected to be announced today. Nick Brown, the minister of agriculture, who has in effect been sidelined by the prime minister this week, last night met the National Farmers Union leader, Ben Gill, to tell him that the vaccination programme must go ahead. Government sources said farmers' leaders increasingly recognised there was now no alternative to what was once described as the last resort. A European Union veterinary surgeons' meeting in Brussels yesterday gave approval for the vaccinations to start. No fresh domestic legislation is required. Adequate supplies of vaccination are said already to be available in Britain. Once vaccinated the cattle will eventually be slaughtered, but the move buys ministers time and helps create firebreaks. General Sir Mike Jackson, commander of British land forces and a Kosovo war veteran, personally oversaw the start of the mass slaughter in Cumbria. The animals were being buried in a mass grave. But the backlog of sheep waiting to be slaughtered in the county had risen to 140,000, leaving the government far off its target of reducing the wait from identification to slaughter to 24 hours. A total of 41 new cases were announced yesterday, taking the total nationwide to at least 716. The Ministry of Agriculture has now authorised 764,319 animals for slaughter, including 552,550 sheep. So far 481,909 of the total have been slaughtered with 282,410 animals still be culled. The prime minister admitted that it could not be said with certainty when the disease would end. Pressed by Mr Hague in the Commons, he conceded: \"When you say how can we be sure when the disease is going to end, the answer is we cannot be sure at the present time.\" In an attempt to reopen the countryside and save the ravaged rural tourist industry, ministers yesterday agreed revised guidelines for the opening of footpaths.

Her former high-flying colleague, Nicola Horlick, set up a new operation after quitting Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, but Ms Galley insisted yesterday that she would never compete against her old firm. Even after her departure she will continue to hold a significant number of share options in Merrill Lynch which she will lose if she goes head-to-head against the company. </p> <p>She also insisted that the decision to leave is not due to burn-out, and at Merrill Lynch yesterday there were few signs of a boardroom battle. \"It has been a very demanding role and I am looking forward to having a more balanced lifestyle.

She gained a reputation as one of a handful of investment experts whose judgments decide the fate of companies. </p> <p>Despite the fact that LWT was one of Mercury's best performing investments, Galley controversially decided to hand control of the company to Granada's Gerry Robinson. Her actions led Greg Dyke, then chief executive of LWT and now director general of the BBC, to issue a harsh warning about the behaviour of investors. </p> <p>In 1999 Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of the BBC and another former LWT man, couldn't resist having a go at Galley. Asked by Management Today whether she was a close personal friend, Bland replied: \"She is neither close, nor personal, nor a friend.\" </p> <p>\u0095 As head of investment at Mercury in 1996, she played a key part in delivering control of the Forte hotel group to Granada when she voted Mercury's 14% stake in Forte in favour of Granada, enabling the media group to succeed in its takeover bid. </p> <p>Control of what was Britain's leading hotel group had been hanging by a thread because Mercury owned around 14% of Granada as well. By steadily acquiring shares in both companies she succeeded in keeping everyone guessing until the last minute. </p> <p>\u0095 Galley made around \u00a310m when Mercury was taken over by the American investment bank Merrill Lynch in a \u00a33.1bn deal in 1997. That was how much she collected for her shares, and was in addition to her earnings that year of around \u00a35.5m. </p> <p><strong>Rupert Jones</strong></p>",

Deals that struck gold \u0095 Galley first hit the headlines in 1994 during Granada's hostile \u00a3750m takeover bid for the London TV station LWT, when she was at Mercury Asset Management. She gained a reputation as one of a handful of investment experts whose judgments decide the fate of companies. Despite the fact that LWT was one of Mercury's best performing investments, Galley controversially decided to hand control of the company to Granada's Gerry Robinson. Her actions led Greg Dyke, then chief executive of LWT and now director general of the BBC, to issue a harsh warning about the behaviour of investors. In 1999 Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of the BBC and another former LWT man, couldn't resist having a go at Galley. Asked by Management Today whether she was a close personal friend, Bland replied: \"She is neither close, nor personal, nor a friend.\" \u0095 As head of investment at Mercury in 1996, she played a key part in delivering control of the Forte hotel group to Granada when she voted Mercury's 14% stake in Forte in favour of Granada, enabling the media group to succeed in its takeover bid. Control of what was Britain's leading hotel group had been hanging by a thread because Mercury owned around 14% of Granada as well. By steadily acquiring shares in both companies she succeeded in keeping everyone guessing until the last minute. \u0095 Galley made around \u00a310m when Mercury was taken over by the American investment bank Merrill Lynch in a \u00a33.1bn deal in 1997. That was how much she collected for her shares, and was in addition to her earnings that year of around \u00a35.5m. Rupert Jones",

Casting has not yet begun, although actress Sarah Smart, who played the lesbian Virginia in ITV show At Home with the Braithwaites, said she had been given a role in the show. \"I'm a mousy student who is very downtrodden,\" she said of her role. However, the BBC has confirmed that actor David Morrissey will make his large-scale directing debut with the project. Morrissey was also one of the stars of Our Mutual Friend, playing the jealous schoolteacher Bradley Headstone. The Charles Dickens adaptation won a string of top awards including the Royal Television Society, Bafta nd Broadcasting Press Guild prizes for best drama. In addition, BBC2 has commissioned Tony Garnett\u00d5s company World Productions to make Table 12, a series of films centred around restaurant conversations. Four new writers and five young directors are involved in the project alongside established acting talent. Performers include Daniela Nardini, Phyllida Law, Paul Nicholls and Gwen Taylor.

The move comes as Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of Ford's advertising agency WPP, warned that everyone should take the anti-consumerist movement seriously. At the beginning of this year Ford teamed up with the National Geographic Society to launch a public awareness campaign called Earthpulse, focusing on conservation issues. Now the partners are launching a 26-episode, half-hour TV series called Earthpulse to explore the ideas of people Ford calls \"environmental heroes\" in 20 countries around the world. Earthpulse will be broadcast on the satellite service National Geographic Channel from April 9. \"Environmental responsibility is a key component of Ford's strategy in becoming a leading consumer-focused company,\" said Jacques Nasser, president and chief executive of Ford. \"At Ford we are fortunate to be in a position to lead the way in global environmental awareness and conservation.\" The company's advertising is handled by WPP, which has also expressed the need to take heed of the environmentalists. Asked about the anti-consumerist movement in Naomi Klein's book No Logo, Sir Martin Sorrell was clear. \"I have not read the book but believe the movement is a serious and important one, not a passing fad, and one that our clients have to take notice of. \"They will ignore it at their peril - the same is true of other movements of a similar nature,\" he told MediaGuardian.co.uk in an online interview yesterday.

The problems arise from the fact that, in 1981, the Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS) had eight character file names (actually 8.3) that were assumed to be all in capital letters. Long file names were added with difficulty in 1995. For maximum control over the appearance of folder names, either make them longer than eight characters or include a space. It is still a good idea to make the first six non-space characters of file names unique. For backwards compatibility, the operating system uses these to generate short (8.3) names from the long ones. </p> <p><strong> Clean desking</strong><br> When I load software, the set-up icons remain on my desktop.

That includes program icons. However, it is best not to save files on the desktop in the first place. The File Save dialogue box lets you choose where to put them. Create a new directory called Downloads and use that instead. </p> <p><strong> Hotmail spam</strong><br> I was interested to read the piece about email using the web. However, I've found that with all the Hotmail accounts I've had, the addresses very quickly find themselves on spam address lists and they fill up with all sorts of rubbish. Why is this?

Both are ticked by default. If you don't notice and untick them, you may well get lots of spam (junk email). This applies to some other services, too. </p> <p>Since you are too cagey to fall for that one, I am at a loss for an explanation. However, I have opened a fresh, unlisted and unused Hotmail account and am waiting for the spam to turn up. </p>",

I think it is better to disable Content Advisor altogether. Microsoft does not explain how - well, you might be a child researching satanic gynaecology. However, the information is widely available. Unfortunately it means editing the Registry, so it is a good idea to back it up first. To disable Content Advisor in IE5, go to Start|Run, type regedit and press OK. Find the entry for H_KEY_ LOCAL_MACHINE and press the little plus sign to its left. Keep going down the tree until you get to HKEY_ LOCAL_MACHINE|Software|Microsoft|Windows| Current Version|Policies and click on Ratings. In the right hand pane, look for an icon called Key. Highlight that then press the delete key to delete the Content Advisor password. Go to Registry (on the menu bar) and select Exit. Restart your PC, and delete the Ratings.pol file. Run Internet Explorer, select Tools|Internet Options (or View|Options, in earlier versions), and click the tab marked Content. The button for Content Advisor should say Enable, which is what you want. If it says Disable, click on it. If asked for a password, do not enter one: just press OK. Word hunter I want to research words in English so I thought a spell-checking dictionary would provide me with a plain list of words. However, looking into a dictionary file, it is obviously all coded. Any suggestions? I would also like a list of all English/ British place names. Brian Russ bjruss@beeb.net JS: Have a look at Kevin's Word Lists Page http://wordlist.sourceforge.net and Bryson's Wordlists http://www.bryson.demon.co.uk/wordlist.html. The latter includes the UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary, aimed at crossword puzzle solvers, the Enhanced North American Benchmark Lexicon (Enable), for Scrabble players, and word lists for Shakespeare and the King James Bible. You could also try the Online Plain Text English Dictionary, known as Opted. It has one line definitions with minimal mark-up added. The Association of British Counties has a Gazetteer of British Placenames, but it would be hard to extract a list. Try searching from the Open Directory at http://dmoz.org/Science/Social_ Sciences/Geography/Place_ Names/ or the place name guide at www.asu.edu/lib/hayden/govdocs/maps/geogname.htm. Time tracker Is there some software that will keep a log of how long you have been online, preferably with a calculation of the costs of that call? Roy Pennington Roypen@btinternet.com JS: There are dozens for Windows: Dave Central has seven pages of them. JoJo Software's NetTimer 2000 looks useful and has nice graphs, while Rat Software's Internet Timer v4.5 is well regarded. Both are available in trial versions. However, TimeUP v4.5 will probably do what you want, and it is free. Mac users could try PPPremier Timer 2.0.4. Filling in Is there any way of programming keys in Windows 98 and/or Internet Explorer 5 so that one or two keystrokes insert a short line of text? For instance, could you program a key to put the first line of your address into an address box on an online form? Steve Morris steven@morriss54.fsnet.co.uk JS: Internet Explorer is supposed to do this for you. Go to Tools|Internet Options and click the tab for Content, then press the AutoComplete button. Put a tick in the box to select AutoComplete for Forms. It is not perfect but it is fairly painless. Naming parts Can you tell me why Windows Explorer displays file and folder names in a variety of formats, eg upper case, lower case, sentence case? Is it possible to make the names look the same? Bob Hawkes postmaster@hawkesfamily.demon.co.uk JS: Not as far as I know. The problems arise from the fact that, in 1981, the Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS) had eight character file names (actually 8.3) that were assumed to be all in capital letters. Long file names were added with difficulty in 1995. For maximum control over the appearance of folder names, either make them longer than eight characters or include a space. It is still a good idea to make the first six non-space characters of file names unique. For backwards compatibility, the operating system uses these to generate short (8.3) names from the long ones. Clean desking When I load software, the set-up icons remain on my desktop. I have tried deleting them but the message \"if this is deleted you may no longer be able to run the program\" appears. Any suggestions, as they clutter my desktop up? David Miles david.miles@djmiles.freeserve.co.uk JS: If the software runs from the Start|Programs menu then you can throw any unwanted non-Microsoft icons into the Recycle Bin. That includes program icons. However, it is best not to save files on the desktop in the first place. The File Save dialogue box lets you choose where to put them. Create a new directory called Downloads and use that instead. Hotmail spam I was interested to read the piece about email using the web. However, I've found that with all the Hotmail accounts I've had, the addresses very quickly find themselves on spam address lists and they fill up with all sorts of rubbish. Why is this? Is the system's security that poor? Elliot Herman elliot@n15.org JS: When you sign up to Hotmail, the form you fill in has a section for Services which includes Hotmail Member Directory and Internet White Pages. Both are ticked by default. If you don't notice and untick them, you may well get lots of spam (junk email). This applies to some other services, too. Since you are too cagey to fall for that one, I am at a loss for an explanation. However, I have opened a fresh, unlisted and unused Hotmail account and am waiting for the spam to turn up.",

Her early death is a loss to both contemporary British poetry and for Caribbean writing.</p> <p>Born in Trinidad, she came to Britain when she was 11. For much of her career she was primarily concerned with exploring, understanding and writing through her consciousness of operating in that liminal space between two cultures known but never fully claimed.</p> <p>She went to school in London and took a degree in English with African and Caribbean studies at the University of Kent. Although she had various stints teaching at one level and another, including for some time as a lecturer at the University of Warwick, she lived essentially as a writer, writing tutor and performer. She settled in Coventry in the late 1980s, where she was able to buy a reasonably priced house which, as she often said, gave her both the security of a base and work space and the freedom to travel as and when the inclination or opportunity took her. Although she had an ebullient performance persona and often wrote quite directly about her personal experience, off stage she was a private person, protective of her own space and the time she could devote to her writing.</p> <p>Her sense of an essential identity was formed by her Trinidad childhood, but after the move to London, where her adolescent and adult life was lived in a sometimes hostile cultural environment, she was never quite comfortable in either place. Amryl confronted that hostility to her as a black woman in Britain - and the distinctive angle on British/Caribbean history it underscored - in some plain-spoken and angry early poems which appeared in her first pamphlet collection, Shackles. This established her reputation as an original voice at a time when there were relatively few young black voices to be heard in British literature:</p> <p>. . . I am</p> <p>Black</p> <p>And I am</p> <p>Angry</p> <p>My name is</p> <p>Midnight</p> <p>Without</p> <p>Pity</p> <p>However, her return visits to Trinidad were not always unproblematic in terms of her wish to identify with the place and its people. The sometimes unsettling reaction of many of those people to her - her blackness there signifying less than her middle-class English accent and inevitably metropolitan attitudes - caused her some anguish. That sometimes painful re-engagement with Trinidad - and indeed the wider Caribbean - was the subject of two collections of poems, Long Road to Nowhere (1985) and the spiritual travelogue Sequins for a Ragged Hem (1988). Sequins is a powerful and unusual book, in that it combines the familiar traveller's tales with an account of another kind of journey and process of discovery, as Johnson confronts the \"ghost who was haunting herself\" in order that she might come to terms with her sense of a fragmented identity. The poems in Long Road to Nowhere chart that same journey in different forms and show her experimenting with a creole voice which gave her, and her audiences, another way into the experience.</p> <p>Through the 90s, Amryl became increasingly fascinated by myth, and experimented with ways of inventing, adapting and applying myth to her contemporary multicultural experience. Her 1992 collection, Gorgons, engaged with the Greek myth of Medusa in a sequence of very powerful poems that took the twin metaphors of \"the look that can kill\" and of one who \"looks but never sees\" to an analysis of the situation of women in contemporary life. Although she was impatient with some of the exclusivities that characterise different \"schools\" of feminism at the beginning of the 21st century, Amryl was very much engaged in and by the women's movement. The diverse cast of women's voices in Gorgons is an expression of her commitment to that cause.</p> <p>Her most recent publication, Calling, which was launched last year, also engages with myth and the associations of the female voice in poetry.</p> <p>There were plans to adapt and produce Gorgons as an opera or musical. Certainly Amryl came to regard performance as being an important - if not her primary - medium of communication. She had a very powerful presence on stage, but was also able to engage and enthuse an audience, to involve them in the event that was her performance.

Mr Vaz, who is embroiled in controversy with the parliamentary standards watchdog, collapsed shortly after a television interview for a satellite news station. Jane Foreblack of British Satellite News was chatting to Mr Vaz after finishing the interview when he suddenly collapsed. She said: \"When we started the interview he wasn't very focused, he seemed to be momentarily closing his eyes and taking a moment to think about things. \"I actually stopped the interview and asked him if he was quite well and if he would like a break.

A foreign office spokesman said: \"He was advised to go for a check up and has done so.\" It is believed his condition is not serious. The minister and the journalist had been discussing an injection of money for the visa entry clearance unit. Ms Foreblack added: \"From the moment he walked into the room I knew he wasn't himself, he's usually very animated and quite jolly and keen to talk to the cameras. He was very subdued. I asked him if he had had a busy day and he said 'Yes, quite'.\" The cause of his collapse was not immediately clear, but Mr Vaz has been under pressure in recent weeks on several fronts and was criticised as recently as Wednesday this week by a foreign office select committee over his work on the crisis in the Balkans. He was singled out in a report by the Labour-dominated Commons foreign affairs committee which said it was \"deeply regrettable\" Mr Vaz had not even visited the region. His name hit the headlines at the end of January after he became embroiled in the passports row over which Peter Mandelson resigned as Northern Ireland minister. Mr Vaz escaped serious criticism in the resulting report, the Hammond inquiry, after allegations he made improper representations on behalf of the controversial millionaire Indian businessmen, the Hinduja brothers. But earlier this month, a 13-month investigation into 18 allegations against him by the parliamentary standards commissioner, Elizabeth Filkin, upheld one complaint: that he had recommended Sarosh Zaiwalla for an honour without revealing he had received financial benefits from him. The report cleared him of nine other charges, and had insufficient evidence on the remaining eight, partly, said a critical Ms Filkin, because Mr Vaz had obstructed her inquiry. Ms Filkin has ordered a fresh investigation into Mr Vaz's links with the Hinduja brothers, who are at the centre of an arms dealing investigation in India.

There have been no deliveries of meat for six weeks from their usual abattoir because of the restriction on animal movements.</p> <p>The park, a leading centre for tiger conservation, has three rare Sumatran tigers and two endangered Amur tigers from northern Russia. The crisis is compounded because visitor numbers have fallen by 90% since the outbreak of foot and mouth and the zoo's income has almost disappeared.</p> <p>\u0095 Vulcanologists checking satellite data from space spotted two apparent eruptions yesterday - at Mount Etna and in Cumbria. Dr David Rothery, from the Open University, said it was due to the high temperatures generated by the fires burning foot and mouth carcasses. If the weather had not been so cloudy, he said, he would have seen similar results in other parts of Britain.</p> <p>\u0095 The Irish government last night banned the feeding of swill to pigs. The use of unused food from air and sea ports for pigswill has been prohibited in Ireland for some time, but now, in line with a similar directive in Britain, all kinds of swill have been outlawed. Restaurant waste food had previously been permitted, provided it was boiled for an hour.</p> <p>\u0095 Up to 10,000 jobs could be lost across Devon over the next 12 months as a result of the crisis. The warning came in a report commissioned by Devon county council from Exeter University to look at the impact of the outbreak in the area. It predicts the loss of 1,200 farming and related industry jobs, and 8,700 in the tourist industry. There could also be a total loss to the county's economy of \u00a3280m.</p> <p>\u0095 A mass cull to curb the spread of the disease in Powys, mid Wales, was announced yesterday by the Welsh rural affairs minister, Carwyn Jones. Mr Jones said all susceptible animals on farms adjoining those where the disease has been confirmed would be killed, starting today.</p> <p>\u0095 Thousands of culled sheep are to be buried on a landfill site on the Northamptonshire/Leicestershire border. The animals, culled in Lincolnshire, had tested negative for the disease, but had come into contact with sheep from Northampton cattle market, thought to be a main source of the outbreak. Farmers in the Market Harborough area say they are concerned about the planned burial at the Biffa waste site, south of Welford, in Northamptonshire.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email \">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth roundup</a><br></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: increase in cases</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,464617,00.html\">The issue explained: Vaccination</a><br><a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained: Pigswill</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list \">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br></p> <p><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463602,00.html\">26.03.2001: Countrytown blues</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html \">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464340,00.html\">28.03.2001: New plan for firewall vaccination</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464312,00.html\">28.03.2001: Illegal meat trail leads to infected countries</a> <br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464283,00.html\">28.03.2001: 'They said nothing could be done'</a> <br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464337,00.html\">28.03.2001: Ministers failed to heed warnings, experts say</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463679,00.html\">27.03.2001, Matthew Engel: Fiddling facts while we burn</a></p> <p><b>Farmer's diary</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464259,00.html\">28.03.2001: On the farm</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guides</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>More on the countryside in crisis</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463746,00.html\">27.03.2001: Hard times</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive: foot and mouth in 1967</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463588,00.html\">28.11.1967, leader: indecision on foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463571,00.html\">18.11.1967: 'Slaughter must seem a cruel remedy'</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463578,00.html\"> 16.11.1967: Foot and mouth may cost agriculture more than \u00a312m</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463596,00.html\">11.11.1967: Emigrant flights to Australia stopped by foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463559,00.html\">01.11.1967: It is cheaper to kill than to prevent cattle disease</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html \">Computerised image of the virus</a><br></p> <p><b>Cartoons</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464422,00.html \">Steve Bell on how pigs will fly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,463874,00.html \">Steve Bell on Hague going over the top</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681 \">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/ \">BSE</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html \">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>NetNotes</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs -

      "bodyText": "The US has enraged Palestinians and other Arabs by killing off a UN security council resolution that would have opened the way for international observers to be sent to the Middle East. Palestinians, who have been pushing for a UN force to help protect the civilian population of the West Bank and Gaza, condemned the US announcement on Tuesday night. The Israelis, opposed to international involvement in the conflict, thanked the US. James Cunningham, the chief US representative to the UN, said the US had vetoed the resolution because \"it is unbalanced and unworkable and hence unwise\". European countries, including Britain and France, abstained. They expressed disappointment that agreement on a formula could not be reached. Intensive negotiations took place among security council members at the UN's New York headquarters to reach a consensus on a resolution. Late on Tuesday, a deal was being predicted by the European members, and a draft was under discussion that avoided using the words \"observer force\" and instead referred vaguely to a \"protection mechanism\", which the Europeans believed could have given the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, the opportunity to send in an observer force. The compromise formula was to be sent to capitals for consideration overnight, with the vote taking place yesterday. But the seven non-aligned countries on the 15-member security council - Singapore, Bangladesh, Jamaica, Mali, Mauritius, Colombia and Tunisia - are sympathetic to the Palestinian position and moved to an immediate vote on a much tougher resolution. It called for the setting up of \"an appropriate mechanism to protect Palestinian civilians, including through the establishment of a UN observer force\". The vote was nine to one with four abstentions. The non-aligned countries were joined by Russia and China. Britain, France, Ireland and Norway abstained. Ukraine did not vote.

      "body": "<p>Every business has one basic need in common: money. The usual way to get hold of it, particularly in the case of companies selling products or services to other businesses, is by invoicing. That most basic need pretty much establishes that every business needs a printer. The question is, what sort and how much to spend?</p> <p>The first thing to establish is budget - which isn't the same as price. If a small business or even a sole trader is about to investigate that first printer purchase, the first thing to do is to walk straight past the printers in a showroom and inspect the printer cartridges instead. Look at how much they cost. Go past these and look at the better quality paper. Check the price once more. </p> <p>Now consider the full cost of your printer - a cheapy that uses expensive cartridges and requires the best sort of paper in order not to smudge will cost more over the next couple of years than pricier models. The other thing to look for is memory. A printer with memory will process some tasks itself; those without will leave it all to the computer or network and may slow things down.</p> <p>It's also useful to know a little about the technology behind the printers themselves. They fall into three basic categories: dot matrix, inkjet/bubblejet and laser. Each has its strengths and weaknesses.</p> <p>Dot matrix is the last of the impact printers. It works by hitting pins in the pattern of a letter against a ribbon, which makes an impression on the paper. It has an image as a noisy and old-fashioned technology but it shouldn't necessarily be written off just yet. It's easier to get a dot matrix printer to handle tear-off stationery such as warehouse dockets, and if you need carbon copies of something, it's the only thing that will work. It's true that it's not suited to the quieter office environment, although it's not as loud as it used to be.</p> <p>Bubblejet, also known as inkjet, works by blowing small ink bubbles on to a page. These bubbles go on wet and although they are dry by the time the document emerges, you'll notice a certain smudging effect with porous paper. The cheaper bubblejets can be deceptive in terms of price since the customer isn't always aware that the toner cartridges can run to \u00a320 or more a shot. Look for inexpensive cartridges and particularly refillable ones, and always check that the coloured inks can be refilled separately to cut down on waste.</p> <p>As long as you've checked, though, you'll find bubblejets extremely good value for money and, depending on the model, very flexible indeed. Colour printing is hardly more expensive than mono, so if you want to scan letterheads in for use in future you can save a little on stationery. You can also print good quality photography on photo paper as long as you have a scanner or digital camera; some models will allow printing on other materials such as transparencies. The extras push the price up, so be ruthless about what you need.</p> <p>Laser printers are better quality but they are expensive. If you really want the corporate look on whichever paper you use they are the only choice but will be twice the price of a good inkjet, or 10 times the price if you want colour. The toner goes on to the paper dry so there will be no smudging, and the print quality overall is far more solid than that offered by the cheaper systems. That said, it's now becoming difficult, without a magnifying glass, to distinguish between a good bubblejet and a cheap laser. Most businesses will be OK with a bubblejet; the extremely image-conscious might prefer laser.</p> <p>Aside from these options there are the specialist versions: rugged printers for use in extreme conditions, plotters for medical scanning and technical drawing, and more expensive versions to take A3 as well as A4 paper. The basics, though, are straightforward - just try to buy a printer that's one step more advanced than you actually need, because you'll always find there's a printing task you hadn't anticipated that suddenly looks essential.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Every business has one basic need in common: money. The usual way to get hold of it, particularly in the case of companies selling products or services to other businesses, is by invoicing. That most basic need pretty much establishes that every business needs a printer. The question is, what sort and how much to spend? The first thing to establish is budget - which isn't the same as price. If a small business or even a sole trader is about to investigate that first printer purchase, the first thing to do is to walk straight past the printers in a showroom and inspect the printer cartridges instead. Look at how much they cost. Go past these and look at the better quality paper. Check the price once more. Now consider the full cost of your printer - a cheapy that uses expensive cartridges and requires the best sort of paper in order not to smudge will cost more over the next couple of years than pricier models. The other thing to look for is memory. A printer with memory will process some tasks itself; those without will leave it all to the computer or network and may slow things down. It's also useful to know a little about the technology behind the printers themselves. They fall into three basic categories: dot matrix, inkjet/bubblejet and laser. Each has its strengths and weaknesses. Dot matrix is the last of the impact printers. It works by hitting pins in the pattern of a letter against a ribbon, which makes an impression on the paper. It has an image as a noisy and old-fashioned technology but it shouldn't necessarily be written off just yet. It's easier to get a dot matrix printer to handle tear-off stationery such as warehouse dockets, and if you need carbon copies of something, it's the only thing that will work. It's true that it's not suited to the quieter office environment, although it's not as loud as it used to be. Bubblejet, also known as inkjet, works by blowing small ink bubbles on to a page. These bubbles go on wet and although they are dry by the time the document emerges, you'll notice a certain smudging effect with porous paper. The cheaper bubblejets can be deceptive in terms of price since the customer isn't always aware that the toner cartridges can run to \u00a320 or more a shot. Look for inexpensive cartridges and particularly refillable ones, and always check that the coloured inks can be refilled separately to cut down on waste. As long as you've checked, though, you'll find bubblejets extremely good value for money and, depending on the model, very flexible indeed. Colour printing is hardly more expensive than mono, so if you want to scan letterheads in for use in future you can save a little on stationery. You can also print good quality photography on photo paper as long as you have a scanner or digital camera; some models will allow printing on other materials such as transparencies. The extras push the price up, so be ruthless about what you need. Laser printers are better quality but they are expensive. If you really want the corporate look on whichever paper you use they are the only choice but will be twice the price of a good inkjet, or 10 times the price if you want colour. The toner goes on to the paper dry so there will be no smudging, and the print quality overall is far more solid than that offered by the cheaper systems. That said, it's now becoming difficult, without a magnifying glass, to distinguish between a good bubblejet and a cheap laser. Most businesses will be OK with a bubblejet; the extremely image-conscious might prefer laser. Aside from these options there are the specialist versions: rugged printers for use in extreme conditions, plotters for medical scanning and technical drawing, and more expensive versions to take A3 as well as A4 paper. The basics, though, are straightforward - just try to buy a printer that's one step more advanced than you actually need, because you'll always find there's a printing task you hadn't anticipated that suddenly looks essential.",

It guarantees a presence on the first two pages of listings after a year, for around \u00a37,000 and counts Intershop, LibertySurf and lastminute.com's French subsidiary Degriftour among clients.</p> <p>Part of NetBooster's three-tier, bespoke service includes the development and submission of \"alias\" webpages to a number of search engines in place of unsuitable originals. The aliases contain several keywords and page titles that will coincide with the engine's defined categories, while being made to account for the specific indexing methodology applicable to each search engine.</p> <p>Target Traffic's services, on the other hand, are considerably cheaper and more focused on the small business end of the spectrum. A site audit costs \u00a3150 and webpage submissions cost \u00a335 per month.</p> <p>There are also off-the-shelf webpage submission software packages available, such as <a href=\"http://www.top-pile.com\">Top-pile</a> and <a href=\"http://www.addweb.com\">Addweb</a>, which fire off a site's webpages to a number of search engines at regular intervals, to be included on their indexes.

It also supplies an emailed acknowledgement after a submission has been made, a rank tracking report and a monthly tips and advice newsletter.

Various methodologies are employed by each search engine's \"spiders\" - the software that trawls across the web to index and rank each site for the retrieval list. \"For example, AltaVista's spiders look for key words when searching for websites, while Excite's spiders look for page titles and the text within web pages,\" explains Richard McBriar, managing director of UK-based web positioning outfit Target Traffic. It is precisely this confusion that has given rise to companies such as Target Traffic and NetBooster. Both are dedicated to web positioning, once offered as a subsidiary service by web design and online media agencies. \"Some sites are more difficult to position than others, but none are beyond positioning,\" says Bourdin at NetBooster, which audits the client website, registers it with chosen search tools and directories and maintains its position on the search list thereafter. It guarantees a presence on the first two pages of listings after a year, for around \u00a37,000 and counts Intershop, LibertySurf and lastminute.com's French subsidiary Degriftour among clients. Part of NetBooster's three-tier, bespoke service includes the development and submission of \"alias\" webpages to a number of search engines in place of unsuitable originals. The aliases contain several keywords and page titles that will coincide with the engine's defined categories, while being made to account for the specific indexing methodology applicable to each search engine. Target Traffic's services, on the other hand, are considerably cheaper and more focused on the small business end of the spectrum. A site audit costs \u00a3150 and webpage submissions cost \u00a335 per month. There are also off-the-shelf webpage submission software packages available, such as Top-pile and Addweb, which fire off a site's webpages to a number of search engines at regular intervals, to be included on their indexes. However, no analysis of the site is carried out, and so there is little guarantee of successful submissions, and there is a high risk of spamming as a result of the constant bombardment, to which the engines do not take kindly. On the basis of the more pages from your website that you submit to the search engines, the better you will do in them, Top-pile will submit your homepage and four other pages to the top 40 search engines every two weeks for an annual fee of \u00a3120. It also supplies an emailed acknowledgement after a submission has been made, a rank tracking report and a monthly tips and advice newsletter. It counts online recruitment site www.netjobs.co.uk among its satisfied customers. According to Charles Talbot, netJobs' marketing manager, the website now receives 1.5m hits a month and has never advertised offline. However, IDC also suggests 95% of all searches are covered by just 12 top search engines. On that basis, the above method may seem a bit scattergun. But at that price, and as an alternative to ineffectual banner advertising, it has to be a more sensible - and, in the long run, cheaper - alternative to doing nothing at all.",

      "body": "<p>Criminal records held on the police national computer are so inaccurate, with errors in up to two-thirds of entries, that MPs have demanded that new checks to prevent sex offenders working with children due to come into effect this summer should be postponed.</p> <p>A report published yesterday by the Commons home affairs select committee says the opening of the new criminal records bureau in July should be delayed until the police have sorted out the problems. The bureau, which has been promised for three years, is due to start issuing 5m criminal record certificates to those who apply for jobs working with children and vulnerable adults as a key part of the government's measures to curb the activities of paedophiles and other sex offenders.</p> <p>The report on the committee's inquiry into preparations for the bureau says that up to 65% of entries on the police national computer have some kind of mistake in them. They range from simple errors such as recording the wrong colour of somebody's eyes to more serious failings such as not including previous convictions.</p> <p>Their estimate is based on recent evidence from the chief inspector of constabulary, who reported that the error rate between forces varies from 15% to 65% and that there are substantial delays in updating the records. Although the police are expected to enter the results of all court cases onto their national computer within 72 hours, the best force only manages to do it within 15 days and the worst takes 354 days.</p> <p>Robin Corbett, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, said the number of inaccuracies and errors in the police records meant it was not yet in a fit state to be used for the new system of criminal records certificates.</p> <p>\"It would be disastrous if errors on the police national computer let even one undesirable person through the checking system, enabling them to work with children or vulnerable adults. We believe that effort should be concentrated on ensuring that the criminal records bureau gets it right when it does open, rather than opening earlier and performing inadequately. It is generally accepted that records on the computer are inaccurate. What we are saying to ministers is don't deliberately put your foot in a mess,\" he said.</p> <p>Paul Kernaghen, chief constable of Hampshire, told the MPs that while the police accepted there were inaccuracies in their crime records they did not believe they were serious enough to compromise the operation of the new bureau. He said the errors were mainly in the detail of personal descriptions of those listed and there had been few very few complaints from the public about the quality of the records.</p> <p>But a survey by the National Association of Probation Officers shows that some of the mistakes are very serious. In one case a man who was charged with a \u00a32,500 theft was given unconditional bail because the court was told there were no previous convictions listed in his entry on the police national computer. In fact he was a murderer who had been released on licence in 1994.</p> <p>In another case the fact that a man had served five years for buggery of a child was not listed in his previous convictions.

      "bodyText": "Criminal records held on the police national computer are so inaccurate, with errors in up to two-thirds of entries, that MPs have demanded that new checks to prevent sex offenders working with children due to come into effect this summer should be postponed. A report published yesterday by the Commons home affairs select committee says the opening of the new criminal records bureau in July should be delayed until the police have sorted out the problems. The bureau, which has been promised for three years, is due to start issuing 5m criminal record certificates to those who apply for jobs working with children and vulnerable adults as a key part of the government's measures to curb the activities of paedophiles and other sex offenders. The report on the committee's inquiry into preparations for the bureau says that up to 65% of entries on the police national computer have some kind of mistake in them. They range from simple errors such as recording the wrong colour of somebody's eyes to more serious failings such as not including previous convictions. Their estimate is based on recent evidence from the chief inspector of constabulary, who reported that the error rate between forces varies from 15% to 65% and that there are substantial delays in updating the records. Although the police are expected to enter the results of all court cases onto their national computer within 72 hours, the best force only manages to do it within 15 days and the worst takes 354 days. Robin Corbett, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, said the number of inaccuracies and errors in the police records meant it was not yet in a fit state to be used for the new system of criminal records certificates. \"It would be disastrous if errors on the police national computer let even one undesirable person through the checking system, enabling them to work with children or vulnerable adults. We believe that effort should be concentrated on ensuring that the criminal records bureau gets it right when it does open, rather than opening earlier and performing inadequately. It is generally accepted that records on the computer are inaccurate. What we are saying to ministers is don't deliberately put your foot in a mess,\" he said. Paul Kernaghen, chief constable of Hampshire, told the MPs that while the police accepted there were inaccuracies in their crime records they did not believe they were serious enough to compromise the operation of the new bureau. He said the errors were mainly in the detail of personal descriptions of those listed and there had been few very few complaints from the public about the quality of the records. But a survey by the National Association of Probation Officers shows that some of the mistakes are very serious. In one case a man who was charged with a \u00a32,500 theft was given unconditional bail because the court was told there were no previous convictions listed in his entry on the police national computer. In fact he was a murderer who had been released on licence in 1994. In another case the fact that a man had served five years for buggery of a child was not listed in his previous convictions. A third case omitted 32 previous convictions, including rape and arson, of a man who was sent to a probation hostel by a court on the grounds that he had only been convicted of an assault and an incident involving criminal damage. The MPs say that since the police are unable to overcome the problem the job should be given to court clerks who should be asked to enter the details on the police national computer within 24 hours of a conviction.",

The Bluetooth radio channel usage is free. </p> <p>Ericsson expects that Blips will take off quickly, once Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones and other devices become popular. </p> <p>Peter Lundin, Ericsson's Blip MD, says that the technology introduces a whole new dimension into mobile networks. </p> <p>He also expects that, within a few years, \"blipping\" on the move is likely to become as common as web surfing from the desk is today. </p> <p>But Ericsson isn't waiting for potential users to beat a path to its door. It has struck a series of partnerships to ensure that the Blip technology reaches out into the marketplace. </p> <p>In the advertisement scenario, the firm says that passers-by could quickly blip download a discount coupon, and further information, for the product or service being promoted, and use their phone to authenticate the discount at a retail outlet. </p> <p>Don't rush out and look for Blip stations just yet, as Ericsson says it doesn't expect the first stations to be rolled out much before the summer. By which time a sizeable number of new mobile phones will be Bluetooth-enabled.</p>",

The Bluetooth radio channel usage is free. Ericsson expects that Blips will take off quickly, once Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones and other devices become popular. Peter Lundin, Ericsson's Blip MD, says that the technology introduces a whole new dimension into mobile networks. He also expects that, within a few years, \"blipping\" on the move is likely to become as common as web surfing from the desk is today. But Ericsson isn't waiting for potential users to beat a path to its door. It has struck a series of partnerships to ensure that the Blip technology reaches out into the marketplace. In the advertisement scenario, the firm says that passers-by could quickly blip download a discount coupon, and further information, for the product or service being promoted, and use their phone to authenticate the discount at a retail outlet. Don't rush out and look for Blip stations just yet, as Ericsson says it doesn't expect the first stations to be rolled out much before the summer. By which time a sizeable number of new mobile phones will be Bluetooth-enabled.",

The Russian leader kept his liberal economic team intact, however, and surprised many by sparing the prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, long seen as vulnerable. Kremlin sources hinted that more changes were likely to a government line-up inherited from Mr Putin's predecessor, Boris Yeltsin. The secretary of the security council, Sergei Ivanov, one of Mr Putin's most loyal colleagues and, like him, a former KGB agent, was named as the new defence minister, replacing the veteran Igor Sergeyev, who became Mr Putin's adviser on strategic stability. Lyubov Kudelina was named the deputy defence minister - the first woman to break through the ranks of uniformed male officers to take up a senior job at the defence ministry. Previously the deputy finance minister, Mrs Kudelina, 45, becomes one of only a handful of women in the upper echelons of Russian politics. Mr Putin said the sweeping changes to his security apparatus were aimed at bringing civilians into key positions previously held by serving officers, and at demilitarising Russian public life. \"[Kudelina] is a well known and very experienced person,\" Mr Putin told RTR state television. \"I can't say the prime minister [Mikhail Kasyanov] was happy with this decision, as he was sorry that she would leave [the finance ministry]... but I think in this situation the defence ministry needs her more.\" Mrs Kudelina is no stranger to military affairs.

      "body": "<p>Slobodan Milosevic, the former leader of Yugoslavia, lost three wars in the disastrous drive to create a Greater Serbia. He is indicted at the Hague tribunal for crimes against humanity. His legacy is still visible in flattened buildings and destroyed communities from Kosovo to Bosnia and beyond. Now he could be put in the dock - for buying himself a new back garden.</p> <p>Two days before Nato started bombing Belgrade two years ago last weekend, Milosevic bought 8,000 square metres of prime land behind his Belgrade villa in the elite suburb of Dedinje for around \u00a33,000. He could face charges of abuse of power for buying the plot at such a knock-down price.</p> <p>\"It's absurd,\" snorts Braca Grubacic, a veteran Belgrade analyst. \"The butcher of the Balkans goes on trial for illegally buying an outhouse and a bit of garden.\"</p> <p>A fortnight ago Milosevic received a summons to the investigating magistrate looking into the alleged property fiddle. He ignored it. It was his first brush with the law at home. It won't be the last, for the property affair is the tip of an iceberg of allegations and indictments concerning the crimes of the Milosevic era.</p> <p>The former president is being hounded from several directions: from inquiries into political assassinations of opponents under his regime, to claims that he committed electoral fraud and probes into alleged war crimes against Bosnia, Kosovo, and Serbs themselves. And then there are the allegations of large-scale embezzlement, running perhaps to hundreds of millions of pounds over the past decade.</p> <p>\"Financial crimes will be the main and the most promising charges against Milosevic,\" says Goran Vesic, a lawyer, politician and chief aide to the current Yugoslav interior ministry.</p> <p>The Guardian has pieced together the jigsaw of Milosevic's missing millions. Our investigation, drawing on interviews with many of his closest advisers, including his personal banker and Serbian ministers, as well as with Hague investigators and senior western officials, has tracked the labyrinthine route in which money was gathered and then salted away.</p> <p>The scale of the plundering of Serbia is awesome. Investigators at the Yugoslav central bank have posited an overall figure of $4bn. Regime insiders, including Milosevic's close relatives, are believed to have hundreds of millions of pounds held abroad in private, numbered or alias accounts in Cyprus, Switzerland, Lebanon, Russia, Greece, and Israel, to name a few of the most favoured destinations.</p> <p>Cyprus was the hub of an intricate money system. Through Cyprus, billions were spirited out of Serbia in cash and redistributed around the world.</p> <p>The banker masterminding the system was Borka Vucic, 73, retired, a Milosevic family friend. Before returning to head Serbia's biggest bank, Beogradska Banka, in 1998, she spent nine years in Cyprus as head of the bank's offshore subsidiary.</p> <p>Speaking in her elegant Belgrade flat around the corner from Milosevic's villa, she admits managing a vast surreptitious exercise in cash dispersal.</p> <p>\"I am not authorised to say how much,\" she smiles. \"All the banks did the same to survive. A lot of people were taking money into Cyprus. There were other people on airplanes carrying the money, but not with me. If someone was taking money without the permission of the bank or the companies, it's not my responsibility.\"</p> <p>Milosevic's brother, wife and daughter have bank accounts, now frozen, in Switzerland, according to Yugoslav government sources and western diplomats in Belgrade. So do Mirko Marjanovic, the former Serbian prime minister who controlled the lucrative grain export business to Russia throughout the 1990s, and Dragan Tomic, a Milosevic aide and former parliament speaker.</p> <p>Two key Milosevic supporters, Nikola Sainovic, a former deputy prime minister who controlled the precious metals trade and is indicted for war crimes in Kosovo, and Dusan Matkovic, ex-deputy leader of Milosevic's Socialist party and head of the giant Sartid steel works at Smederovo outside Belgrade, have bank accounts in Beirut, according to a former banker inside the regime. Mladjan Dinkic, the new central bank governor who is on a crusade to recover the cash, estimates the overall sum at $4bn. The bulk was used not for personal gain, but to keep Serbia trading through a decade of United Nations economic sanctions.</p> <p>\"Milosevic does not have billions stashed abroad. The money was spent on survival and some people got enormously wealthy,\" says a knowledgeable Serbian source who asked not to be named.</p> <p>So where did the money come from? Flawed privatisations have been suggested as one important source. Vuk Obradovic, a Serbian politician, is heading a commission of inquiry into what happened to hundreds of millions of pounds that was never booked into government accounts as part of the proceeds from eight privatisations in the 90s.</p> <p><b> Vanished</b><br></p> <p>Another common technique involved customs receipts. Boris Begovic, chief economic adviser to the Yugoslav government, ordered an audit of the customs service for last year. He claimed tens of millions of German marks in government revenue had vanished because traders favoured by or working for the regime were exempted from customs duties.</p> <p>\"I was stunned by the gap between the nominal customs burden and the effective customs burden,\" he says. \"And this had been going on for 10 years. They be came more greedy as time went on. The last two years were the bonanza time.\"</p> <p>There were preferential loans to crony companies and individuals plus windfalls from manipulating the foreign exchange black market. Beobanka, an offshoot of Mrs Vucic's Beogradska, was ordered to give \"loans\" to the TV company owned by Milosevic's daughter Marija, and to the trading company owned by his notorious son Marko.</p> <p>Under Milosevic in 1993, Yugoslav inflation was at the inconceivable annualised level of 286 billion per cent, with the central bank issuing 50-million dinar notes. More routinely in recent years the real value of the national currency was a fifth of the official rate, with the regime controlling the black market and using it to hoover up hard currency when it needed it. State-controlled banks were ordered to provide unsecured D-mark loans at the official rate to countless crony firms and individuals who could then use the black market to make an instant 400% profit.</p> <p>A regime insider and banker who helped orchestrate the 1990s operations and had his own bank account in London frozen reckons that $20m has been embezzled by Milosevic associates. Others put the figure much higher.</p> <p>\"We were never charged with taking private funds outside the country,\" says the banker. \"We were hiding government funds, preserving them from the sanctions, playing games with the European Union and the US.\"</p> <p>When UN sanctions were imposed on Yugoslavia in May 1992 because of the Bosnia war, Milosevic had already anticipated the embargo and established the infrastructure for exploiting the international banking and trading systems to bust sanctions and keep importing vital commodities.</p> <p>The elaborate operation was centred on Cyprus because of its banking secrecy, offshore companies culture, and the sympathy of Greek Cypriots for the plight of their fellow Orthodox Serbs. Cyprus was the conduit for billions of dollars in cash from Serbia. The funds were then dispersed globally or into the accounts of scores of anonymously owned offshore companies registered in Cyprus.</p> <p>In the early 1980s, Milosevic was president of Beogradska Banka and Mrs Vucic was his deputy. She lays fair claim to being the most formidable banker communist Yugoslavia ever produced. Shrewd and well connected, Mrs Vucic boasts of knowing 4,000 bankers around the world and shows off photo albums and a silver platter she received from Barclays Bank. If there is no doubt that Mrs Vucic was the linchpin of the Milosevic money system, she vehemently denies handling Milosevic family money or doing anything illegal. She insists she was only doing her patriotic duty in helping her country to evade sanctions.</p> <p>\"I know Mr Milosevic quite well and I know the family. He was a fighter, a good banker and a good president,\" she says. \"But we had no business at all with the family. I believe they have some other banks but not Beogradska.\"</p> <p>After the toppling of Milosevic last October, Mrs Vucic, by then overall president of Beogradska Banka in Belgrade, declined to vacate her office. \"I refused to hand over the bank to those unauthorised men, five of them who came with guns,\" she explains.</p> <p>Serb officials and western diplomats in Belgrade tell a different story. Mrs Vucic, they say, was evicted from the bank, returned with a team of armed guards for a \"midnight excursion\", broke into her old office in the early hours, and emptied the safe of documents. On Tuesday Belgrade prosecutors announced they were opening an inquiry into whether some of Mrs Vucic's activities as bank chief were against the national interest.</p> <p>All through the 1990s she headed Beogradska Banka's offshore subsidiary in Cyprus, the biggest offshore bank on the island, handling the accounts of the myriad Serbian offshore companies established there, such as Yugometall, the state company trading in metals.</p> <p>Its shareholders secret, the company was managed in Nicosia by Edo Alibegovic, now based in Zurich and running a different company which is currently involved in a Swiss inquiry into alleged illegal Serbian gold exports. Key clients of Mrs Vucic and Mr Alibegovic in Cyprus were the Bor copper and gold mining complex in southern Serbia, a state enterprise that is the fiefdom of Sainovic, and the Sartid steel works run by Matkovic.</p> <p>A former Beogradska Banka executive and an authoritative Yugoslav diplomatic source say Sainovic and Matkovic have private bank accounts in Beirut, where Sainovic's son is a trader. Both men were frequent visitors to Beirut in the mid to late 90s, as was Mrs Vucic. \"I like Beirut. I've been there many times,\" she says.</p> <p>Mrs Vucic's bank in Cyprus and Banque Saradar in Beirut struck up a cooperation arrangement in the late 90s when the Cypriots were coming under strong US pressure to close down the Serbian operations. A typical scheme to siphon off the money, sources say, was for Mr Matkovic to agree to sell Sartid steel to a Lebanese client. The deal is financed through the Banque Saradar in Beirut. The steel is delivered. The client complains falsely that the steel is sub-standard. Both sides nominally agree to half the price and the other half is split between them.</p> <p>Lebanese banking secrecy laws proscribe divulging information on accounts unless the funds are suspected of being involved in the drug trade. The Yugoslav airline JAT was required to act as a courier for the shipment of large volumes of US dollars and German marks, in cash in bags and suitcases, from Serbia to Cyprus from where it was taken to Beirut, also in cash, or transferred to Switzerland and other countries using accounts at Cyprus Popular Bank, Serbian and international sources say. JAT's general director, Zika Petrovic, was shot dead outside his Belgrade home in May 1999, allegedly because he knew too much about how the regime used his airline to ship the cash.</p> <p>The airline is also said to have been used as a courier for drugs, with Milosevic regime associates implicated in international drug trafficking. This month Serbian police found more than 600kg of high-grade heroin deposited in a Belgrade bank vault by Milosevic's secret police. When two key Milosevic henchmen, Rade Markovic, state security chief, and Mihalj Kertes, head of Milosevic's customs service, were arrested earlier this year, police found drugs in their offices.</p> <p>\"There is considerable evidence indicating that Milosevic and his entourage constitute an OC [organised crime] structure and are engaged in drugs dealing, money laundering, and other criminal acts,\" said a confidential German intelligence report leaked just after last October's revolution.</p> <p>The hard evidence of corruption and embezzlement against the Milosevic regime is mounting weekly. Seven former Milosevic loyalists were detained this week in Belgrade on suspicion of property fiddles, fraud, and profiteering in medicines. But given that most of the stolen funds are dispersed internationally, the financial case against Milosevic is also being hampered by the lack of a concerted international effort to pool intelligence.</p> <p>For example, every time Mrs Vucic or someone else took Serbian cash into Cyprus, they had to fill in a Cypriot customs slip which was then lodged with the central bank in Nicosia.</p> <p>\"The customs declarations would be very interesting,\" says a western diplomat in Belgrade. \"Some people at the Cyprus central bank want to cooperate but they are being stopped by people higher up.\" Cyprus has refused to turn over the customs slips to Serb investigators.</p> <p>The Hague tribunal, too, has had a small team of financial detectives working confidentially at the Cyprus central bank for the past year. They report personally to Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor in the Hague who, highly unusually, was recently given 25 crates of documents on Serbian accounts by the Cypriots.</p> <p>But Mrs Del Ponte is in a feud with the new Belgrade government and refuses to share her information with Mr Dinkic, preferring to withhold it as leverage to encourage Belgrade to extradite indicted war criminals, most notably Milosevic himself.</p> <p>If Cyprus was the main hub for the dispersal of regime monies worldwide, there is not much Serbian money left on the island now. So where is it? It is thought to be sitting in moderate amounts in hundreds of accounts across the world, not one of them known to be bearing the name of Slobodan Milosevic. One analyst in Belgrade said last week that more money will be spent searching for the missing millions than is recovered.</p> <p>'I don't expect much money back at all,\" says Mr Begovic. \"We don't include it in our budget calculations.\" The authorities appear to be struggling to build a watertight case on the bigger charges, because for more than a decade the hallmark of Milosevic's modus operandi was plausible deniability: never leave a paper trail that might incriminate yourself and always shift the blame for political, military, diplomatic and economic mistakes on to hired-then-fired underlings.</p> <p>Despite this hurdle, of all the inquiries now under way against Milosevic the financial one looks most promising. Until last October, observers liked to compare Milosevic to Saddam Hussein. Now the common comparison is Al Capone. In the end, the FBI put the racketeer and murderer in jail but could only nail him for financial crimes.</p> <p>Slobodan Milosevic, meanwhile, is living out what look like his last weeks as a free man, cushioned from the corruption and bloodshed he unleashed throughout a decade of absolute power. Around the corner from Mrs Vucic's flat, the former president of Yugoslavia enjoys the comforts of a government villa at Uzicka Street Number 11, on millionaires' row in the elite Belgrade suburb of Dedinje.</p> <p>He is not paying his bills or rates, say government officials. He is, however, funding a retinue of private security guards who patrol behind the high metal fences along the street from Milosevic's private home, with its new back garden.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Slobodan Milosevic, the former leader of Yugoslavia, lost three wars in the disastrous drive to create a Greater Serbia. He is indicted at the Hague tribunal for crimes against humanity. His legacy is still visible in flattened buildings and destroyed communities from Kosovo to Bosnia and beyond. Now he could be put in the dock - for buying himself a new back garden. Two days before Nato started bombing Belgrade two years ago last weekend, Milosevic bought 8,000 square metres of prime land behind his Belgrade villa in the elite suburb of Dedinje for around \u00a33,000. He could face charges of abuse of power for buying the plot at such a knock-down price. \"It's absurd,\" snorts Braca Grubacic, a veteran Belgrade analyst. \"The butcher of the Balkans goes on trial for illegally buying an outhouse and a bit of garden.\" A fortnight ago Milosevic received a summons to the investigating magistrate looking into the alleged property fiddle. He ignored it. It was his first brush with the law at home. It won't be the last, for the property affair is the tip of an iceberg of allegations and indictments concerning the crimes of the Milosevic era. The former president is being hounded from several directions: from inquiries into political assassinations of opponents under his regime, to claims that he committed electoral fraud and probes into alleged war crimes against Bosnia, Kosovo, and Serbs themselves. And then there are the allegations of large-scale embezzlement, running perhaps to hundreds of millions of pounds over the past decade. \"Financial crimes will be the main and the most promising charges against Milosevic,\" says Goran Vesic, a lawyer, politician and chief aide to the current Yugoslav interior ministry. The Guardian has pieced together the jigsaw of Milosevic's missing millions. Our investigation, drawing on interviews with many of his closest advisers, including his personal banker and Serbian ministers, as well as with Hague investigators and senior western officials, has tracked the labyrinthine route in which money was gathered and then salted away. The scale of the plundering of Serbia is awesome. Investigators at the Yugoslav central bank have posited an overall figure of $4bn. Regime insiders, including Milosevic's close relatives, are believed to have hundreds of millions of pounds held abroad in private, numbered or alias accounts in Cyprus, Switzerland, Lebanon, Russia, Greece, and Israel, to name a few of the most favoured destinations. Cyprus was the hub of an intricate money system. Through Cyprus, billions were spirited out of Serbia in cash and redistributed around the world. The banker masterminding the system was Borka Vucic, 73, retired, a Milosevic family friend. Before returning to head Serbia's biggest bank, Beogradska Banka, in 1998, she spent nine years in Cyprus as head of the bank's offshore subsidiary. Speaking in her elegant Belgrade flat around the corner from Milosevic's villa, she admits managing a vast surreptitious exercise in cash dispersal. \"I am not authorised to say how much,\" she smiles. \"All the banks did the same to survive. A lot of people were taking money into Cyprus. There were other people on airplanes carrying the money, but not with me. If someone was taking money without the permission of the bank or the companies, it's not my responsibility.\" Milosevic's brother, wife and daughter have bank accounts, now frozen, in Switzerland, according to Yugoslav government sources and western diplomats in Belgrade. So do Mirko Marjanovic, the former Serbian prime minister who controlled the lucrative grain export business to Russia throughout the 1990s, and Dragan Tomic, a Milosevic aide and former parliament speaker. Two key Milosevic supporters, Nikola Sainovic, a former deputy prime minister who controlled the precious metals trade and is indicted for war crimes in Kosovo, and Dusan Matkovic, ex-deputy leader of Milosevic's Socialist party and head of the giant Sartid steel works at Smederovo outside Belgrade, have bank accounts in Beirut, according to a former banker inside the regime. Mladjan Dinkic, the new central bank governor who is on a crusade to recover the cash, estimates the overall sum at $4bn. The bulk was used not for personal gain, but to keep Serbia trading through a decade of United Nations economic sanctions. \"Milosevic does not have billions stashed abroad. The money was spent on survival and some people got enormously wealthy,\" says a knowledgeable Serbian source who asked not to be named. So where did the money come from? Flawed privatisations have been suggested as one important source. Vuk Obradovic, a Serbian politician, is heading a commission of inquiry into what happened to hundreds of millions of pounds that was never booked into government accounts as part of the proceeds from eight privatisations in the 90s. Vanished Another common technique involved customs receipts. Boris Begovic, chief economic adviser to the Yugoslav government, ordered an audit of the customs service for last year. He claimed tens of millions of German marks in government revenue had vanished because traders favoured by or working for the regime were exempted from customs duties. \"I was stunned by the gap between the nominal customs burden and the effective customs burden,\" he says. \"And this had been going on for 10 years. They be came more greedy as time went on. The last two years were the bonanza time.\" There were preferential loans to crony companies and individuals plus windfalls from manipulating the foreign exchange black market. Beobanka, an offshoot of Mrs Vucic's Beogradska, was ordered to give \"loans\" to the TV company owned by Milosevic's daughter Marija, and to the trading company owned by his notorious son Marko. Under Milosevic in 1993, Yugoslav inflation was at the inconceivable annualised level of 286 billion per cent, with the central bank issuing 50-million dinar notes. More routinely in recent years the real value of the national currency was a fifth of the official rate, with the regime controlling the black market and using it to hoover up hard currency when it needed it. State-controlled banks were ordered to provide unsecured D-mark loans at the official rate to countless crony firms and individuals who could then use the black market to make an instant 400% profit. A regime insider and banker who helped orchestrate the 1990s operations and had his own bank account in London frozen reckons that $20m has been embezzled by Milosevic associates. Others put the figure much higher. \"We were never charged with taking private funds outside the country,\" says the banker. \"We were hiding government funds, preserving them from the sanctions, playing games with the European Union and the US.\" When UN sanctions were imposed on Yugoslavia in May 1992 because of the Bosnia war, Milosevic had already anticipated the embargo and established the infrastructure for exploiting the international banking and trading systems to bust sanctions and keep importing vital commodities. The elaborate operation was centred on Cyprus because of its banking secrecy, offshore companies culture, and the sympathy of Greek Cypriots for the plight of their fellow Orthodox Serbs. Cyprus was the conduit for billions of dollars in cash from Serbia. The funds were then dispersed globally or into the accounts of scores of anonymously owned offshore companies registered in Cyprus. In the early 1980s, Milosevic was president of Beogradska Banka and Mrs Vucic was his deputy. She lays fair claim to being the most formidable banker communist Yugoslavia ever produced. Shrewd and well connected, Mrs Vucic boasts of knowing 4,000 bankers around the world and shows off photo albums and a silver platter she received from Barclays Bank. If there is no doubt that Mrs Vucic was the linchpin of the Milosevic money system, she vehemently denies handling Milosevic family money or doing anything illegal. She insists she was only doing her patriotic duty in helping her country to evade sanctions. \"I know Mr Milosevic quite well and I know the family. He was a fighter, a good banker and a good president,\" she says. \"But we had no business at all with the family. I believe they have some other banks but not Beogradska.\" After the toppling of Milosevic last October, Mrs Vucic, by then overall president of Beogradska Banka in Belgrade, declined to vacate her office. \"I refused to hand over the bank to those unauthorised men, five of them who came with guns,\" she explains. Serb officials and western diplomats in Belgrade tell a different story. Mrs Vucic, they say, was evicted from the bank, returned with a team of armed guards for a \"midnight excursion\", broke into her old office in the early hours, and emptied the safe of documents. On Tuesday Belgrade prosecutors announced they were opening an inquiry into whether some of Mrs Vucic's activities as bank chief were against the national interest. All through the 1990s she headed Beogradska Banka's offshore subsidiary in Cyprus, the biggest offshore bank on the island, handling the accounts of the myriad Serbian offshore companies established there, such as Yugometall, the state company trading in metals. Its shareholders secret, the company was managed in Nicosia by Edo Alibegovic, now based in Zurich and running a different company which is currently involved in a Swiss inquiry into alleged illegal Serbian gold exports. Key clients of Mrs Vucic and Mr Alibegovic in Cyprus were the Bor copper and gold mining complex in southern Serbia, a state enterprise that is the fiefdom of Sainovic, and the Sartid steel works run by Matkovic. A former Beogradska Banka executive and an authoritative Yugoslav diplomatic source say Sainovic and Matkovic have private bank accounts in Beirut, where Sainovic's son is a trader. Both men were frequent visitors to Beirut in the mid to late 90s, as was Mrs Vucic. \"I like Beirut. I've been there many times,\" she says. Mrs Vucic's bank in Cyprus and Banque Saradar in Beirut struck up a cooperation arrangement in the late 90s when the Cypriots were coming under strong US pressure to close down the Serbian operations. A typical scheme to siphon off the money, sources say, was for Mr Matkovic to agree to sell Sartid steel to a Lebanese client. The deal is financed through the Banque Saradar in Beirut. The steel is delivered. The client complains falsely that the steel is sub-standard. Both sides nominally agree to half the price and the other half is split between them. Lebanese banking secrecy laws proscribe divulging information on accounts unless the funds are suspected of being involved in the drug trade. The Yugoslav airline JAT was required to act as a courier for the shipment of large volumes of US dollars and German marks, in cash in bags and suitcases, from Serbia to Cyprus from where it was taken to Beirut, also in cash, or transferred to Switzerland and other countries using accounts at Cyprus Popular Bank, Serbian and international sources say. JAT's general director, Zika Petrovic, was shot dead outside his Belgrade home in May 1999, allegedly because he knew too much about how the regime used his airline to ship the cash. The airline is also said to have been used as a courier for drugs, with Milosevic regime associates implicated in international drug trafficking. This month Serbian police found more than 600kg of high-grade heroin deposited in a Belgrade bank vault by Milosevic's secret police. When two key Milosevic henchmen, Rade Markovic, state security chief, and Mihalj Kertes, head of Milosevic's customs service, were arrested earlier this year, police found drugs in their offices. \"There is considerable evidence indicating that Milosevic and his entourage constitute an OC [organised crime] structure and are engaged in drugs dealing, money laundering, and other criminal acts,\" said a confidential German intelligence report leaked just after last October's revolution. The hard evidence of corruption and embezzlement against the Milosevic regime is mounting weekly. Seven former Milosevic loyalists were detained this week in Belgrade on suspicion of property fiddles, fraud, and profiteering in medicines. But given that most of the stolen funds are dispersed internationally, the financial case against Milosevic is also being hampered by the lack of a concerted international effort to pool intelligence. For example, every time Mrs Vucic or someone else took Serbian cash into Cyprus, they had to fill in a Cypriot customs slip which was then lodged with the central bank in Nicosia. \"The customs declarations would be very interesting,\" says a western diplomat in Belgrade. \"Some people at the Cyprus central bank want to cooperate but they are being stopped by people higher up.\" Cyprus has refused to turn over the customs slips to Serb investigators. The Hague tribunal, too, has had a small team of financial detectives working confidentially at the Cyprus central bank for the past year. They report personally to Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor in the Hague who, highly unusually, was recently given 25 crates of documents on Serbian accounts by the Cypriots. But Mrs Del Ponte is in a feud with the new Belgrade government and refuses to share her information with Mr Dinkic, preferring to withhold it as leverage to encourage Belgrade to extradite indicted war criminals, most notably Milosevic himself. If Cyprus was the main hub for the dispersal of regime monies worldwide, there is not much Serbian money left on the island now. So where is it? It is thought to be sitting in moderate amounts in hundreds of accounts across the world, not one of them known to be bearing the name of Slobodan Milosevic. One analyst in Belgrade said last week that more money will be spent searching for the missing millions than is recovered. 'I don't expect much money back at all,\" says Mr Begovic. \"We don't include it in our budget calculations.\" The authorities appear to be struggling to build a watertight case on the bigger charges, because for more than a decade the hallmark of Milosevic's modus operandi was plausible deniability: never leave a paper trail that might incriminate yourself and always shift the blame for political, military, diplomatic and economic mistakes on to hired-then-fired underlings. Despite this hurdle, of all the inquiries now under way against Milosevic the financial one looks most promising. Until last October, observers liked to compare Milosevic to Saddam Hussein. Now the common comparison is Al Capone. In the end, the FBI put the racketeer and murderer in jail but could only nail him for financial crimes. Slobodan Milosevic, meanwhile, is living out what look like his last weeks as a free man, cushioned from the corruption and bloodshed he unleashed throughout a decade of absolute power. Around the corner from Mrs Vucic's flat, the former president of Yugoslavia enjoys the comforts of a government villa at Uzicka Street Number 11, on millionaires' row in the elite Belgrade suburb of Dedinje. He is not paying his bills or rates, say government officials. He is, however, funding a retinue of private security guards who patrol behind the high metal fences along the street from Milosevic's private home, with its new back garden.",

They detained 22 ethnic Albanians in the provincial capital, Pristina, and near the north-eastern town of Podujevo, where seven Serbs were killed and 43 injured six weeks ago by a bomb which destroyed the first of a convoy of five buses taking families from the Serbian city of Nis to Gracanica in Kosovo. The incident was described by Brigadier Robert Fry, then a senior British K-For commander, as \"a ruthless premeditated attack of mass murder\". Nato and British commanders described the arrests as evidence of the tough action now being taken against extremists. The leaking of the SAS's role in the operation reinforces the message. Former KLA members have long been suspected of killing and intimidating Kosovan Serbs. Yesterday a K-For spokesman, Axel-Bernd Jandesek, said the force had detained 80 ethnic Albanian guerrillas operating in Macedonia, some of whom might be KLA veterans and Protection Corps members. Another K-For spokesman, Squadron Leader Richard Heffer, said troops patrolling the Kosovo-Macedonia border had intercepted light machine guns, 9,240 rounds of ammunition, and more than 100 rifle-launched grenades, in the past month, and detained about 200 suspected insurgents coming from or going towards Macedonia. Macedonian forces, backed by artillery, tanks and helicopter gunships began attacking insurgents along the Kosovan border yesterday. The rebels vowed to fight back. The government's offensive was aimed mainly at the village of Gracane. Its spokesman, Antonio Milososki, said: \"This is our final operation to ... establish control of this stretch of land. We want to create conditions for continuation of political dialogue.\" The EU foreign and security policy chief, Javier Solana, urged Macedonian leaders to open political talks with ethnic Albanian leaders as soon as possible to avoid the conflict spreading further. Meanwhile Serb forceswere reported to have killed an ethnic Albanian guerrilla leader in the Presevo valley, close to the Macedonian border. Useful links Yugoslavia war crimes",

      "byline": "John Cassy",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Miles Broadbent does not make many telephone calls. So when you receive one from him you know you are wanted. Mr Broadbent, 64-year-old chairman of the Miles Partnership, is the doyen of headhunters, discreetly searching out the most promising executive talent for Britain's top companies, and reaping handsome fees in return. </p> <p>Over the past 20 years he has recruited more than 80 chief executives. </p> <p>Notable successes include putting David Jones and Sir Brian Pitman into retailer Next as chief executive and chairman respectively. He plucked a relatively unknown Colin Marshall out of Avis and sent him to the top of British Airways, and to a peerage. He later found Sir Richard Sykes for Glaxo Wellcome and Sir Clive Thompson for Rentokil. \"I suppose you could say I've had some decent hits,\" Mr Broadbent says. </p> <p>As a business, corporate recruitment - and headhunting in particular - is booming. Executive salaries are higher than ever before, job markets are increasingly fluid, non-executive directors are nervous about appointing the wrong person and shareholders are becoming more intolerant of under-performing bosses. </p> <p>These factors are contributing to a growing volume of lucrative business for recruitment firms. </p> <p><strong> Biggest new issue</strong><br> </p> <p> In Britain there are estimated to be 2,500 executive recruitment consultancies and 150 headhunting firms. Investment bank CSFB reckons their combined turnover in 1999 was \u00a318.4bn and that the sector is growing at 25% a year. </p> <p>Yesterday's flotation of recruitment firm Michael Page, although at a lower price than was expected due to the turbulence of the stock markets, was still the biggest new issue of the year. </p> <p>This morning the industry's movers and shakers will gather in Le Meridien Hotel in London for a conference on the future of executive recruitment, organised by the magazine Executive Grapevine. </p> <p>In attendance will be senior figures from Allied Domecq, the BBC, Arthur Andersen, Imperial Tobacco, Tesco and Reuters. They know as well as anyone that the real talent does not flick to the situations vacant pages or pop down to the jobcentre. </p> <p>Those that really matter do not apply for jobs, they wait for the flattering phone call from the likes of Mr Broadbent who will promise to smooth any appointment with the utmost discretion and minimal fuss. </p> <p>Keeping in with these aristocrats of recruitment is important if you want to able to tell shareholders that you made the maximum effort to hire the very best to run their company. </p> <p>The headhunting market is dominated by a small number of supremely well connected firms with networks extending across the world. When Saxon Bampfylde was asked by media group Pearson to find it a new chief executive, the headhunter eventually plumped for a relatively unknown American, Marjorie Scardino. </p> <p>When it was commissioned to find a new chief executive for Sunderland football club it ferreted out Hugh Roberts from the Suffolk-based brewer Adnams after a nine-month search. </p> <p>Mr Broadbent says the key to becoming a successful headhunter is maintaining good contacts and a strong reputation for finding successful recruits. \"It's all about people. The name over the door to this business may have changed three times but the clients are the same.\" </p> <p>A regular at the Ritz, Mr Broadbent says he tries to have lunch with every chief executive that he has placed at least once each year and that many of his commissions are referrals from firms where he has previously placed staff. </p> <p>\"You are pretty much dependent on the performance of the bloke or bloke-ess that you find. If they do well the firm will use you again, if you get a failure you don't tend to get invited back.\" </p> <p>The only place he advertises is in Royal Opera House programmes. \"It's pretty much our target audience.\" </p> <p>Michael Byrne, chief operating officer at The Rose Partnership which specialises in finding staff for investment banks, says: \"The secret is absolute closeness to your client and understanding better than them what they want, the type of person they need. We'll spend days inside a bank learning absolutely everything about it before we go recruiting on its behalf.\" </p> <p>The fee headhunters typically charge for each person placed is usually equivalent to a third of the individual's first-year salary. It is not uncommon for the bill for finding a top chief executive to top \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>An increasing number of big companies are bemoaning the fees and some complain about the quality of service they get. </p> <p>Spencer Stuart, the recruitment agency where shadow chancellor Michael Portillo's wife, Carolyn Eadie, is one of the senior executives, is reported to have billed Barclays \u00a3500,000 for finding the bank a successor to chief executive Martin Taylor. </p> <p>The problem was that the man they found, former US marine Mike O'Neil, signed a \u00a310m, three-year deal, then developed a heart complaint and had to quit on the first day. Spencer Stuart had to find someone else for free, eventually plumping for Canadian Matt Barrett. </p> <p>No one at the notoriously low-profile firm is prepared to speak about the incident, or the other 800 senior-level searches it conducts each year in 20 countries. </p> <p>\"I have to say that Spencer Stuart does not speak to the press,\" sniffs a receptionist. </p> <p><strong> Women top pay league</strong><br> </p> <p> The growth in trade has catapulted the headhunters themselves into the list of Britain's top earners. Last year a survey by research firm Heywood Associates found that the most successful can earn up to \u00a31.6m a year.

      "bodyText": "Miles Broadbent does not make many telephone calls. So when you receive one from him you know you are wanted. Mr Broadbent, 64-year-old chairman of the Miles Partnership, is the doyen of headhunters, discreetly searching out the most promising executive talent for Britain's top companies, and reaping handsome fees in return. Over the past 20 years he has recruited more than 80 chief executives. Notable successes include putting David Jones and Sir Brian Pitman into retailer Next as chief executive and chairman respectively. He plucked a relatively unknown Colin Marshall out of Avis and sent him to the top of British Airways, and to a peerage. He later found Sir Richard Sykes for Glaxo Wellcome and Sir Clive Thompson for Rentokil. \"I suppose you could say I've had some decent hits,\" Mr Broadbent says. As a business, corporate recruitment - and headhunting in particular - is booming. Executive salaries are higher than ever before, job markets are increasingly fluid, non-executive directors are nervous about appointing the wrong person and shareholders are becoming more intolerant of under-performing bosses. These factors are contributing to a growing volume of lucrative business for recruitment firms. Biggest new issue In Britain there are estimated to be 2,500 executive recruitment consultancies and 150 headhunting firms. Investment bank CSFB reckons their combined turnover in 1999 was \u00a318.4bn and that the sector is growing at 25% a year. Yesterday's flotation of recruitment firm Michael Page, although at a lower price than was expected due to the turbulence of the stock markets, was still the biggest new issue of the year. This morning the industry's movers and shakers will gather in Le Meridien Hotel in London for a conference on the future of executive recruitment, organised by the magazine Executive Grapevine. In attendance will be senior figures from Allied Domecq, the BBC, Arthur Andersen, Imperial Tobacco, Tesco and Reuters. They know as well as anyone that the real talent does not flick to the situations vacant pages or pop down to the jobcentre. Those that really matter do not apply for jobs, they wait for the flattering phone call from the likes of Mr Broadbent who will promise to smooth any appointment with the utmost discretion and minimal fuss. Keeping in with these aristocrats of recruitment is important if you want to able to tell shareholders that you made the maximum effort to hire the very best to run their company. The headhunting market is dominated by a small number of supremely well connected firms with networks extending across the world. When Saxon Bampfylde was asked by media group Pearson to find it a new chief executive, the headhunter eventually plumped for a relatively unknown American, Marjorie Scardino. When it was commissioned to find a new chief executive for Sunderland football club it ferreted out Hugh Roberts from the Suffolk-based brewer Adnams after a nine-month search. Mr Broadbent says the key to becoming a successful headhunter is maintaining good contacts and a strong reputation for finding successful recruits. \"It's all about people. The name over the door to this business may have changed three times but the clients are the same.\" A regular at the Ritz, Mr Broadbent says he tries to have lunch with every chief executive that he has placed at least once each year and that many of his commissions are referrals from firms where he has previously placed staff. \"You are pretty much dependent on the performance of the bloke or bloke-ess that you find. If they do well the firm will use you again, if you get a failure you don't tend to get invited back.\" The only place he advertises is in Royal Opera House programmes. \"It's pretty much our target audience.\" Michael Byrne, chief operating officer at The Rose Partnership which specialises in finding staff for investment banks, says: \"The secret is absolute closeness to your client and understanding better than them what they want, the type of person they need. We'll spend days inside a bank learning absolutely everything about it before we go recruiting on its behalf.\" The fee headhunters typically charge for each person placed is usually equivalent to a third of the individual's first-year salary. It is not uncommon for the bill for finding a top chief executive to top \u00a3500,000. An increasing number of big companies are bemoaning the fees and some complain about the quality of service they get. Spencer Stuart, the recruitment agency where shadow chancellor Michael Portillo's wife, Carolyn Eadie, is one of the senior executives, is reported to have billed Barclays \u00a3500,000 for finding the bank a successor to chief executive Martin Taylor. The problem was that the man they found, former US marine Mike O'Neil, signed a \u00a310m, three-year deal, then developed a heart complaint and had to quit on the first day. Spencer Stuart had to find someone else for free, eventually plumping for Canadian Matt Barrett. No one at the notoriously low-profile firm is prepared to speak about the incident, or the other 800 senior-level searches it conducts each year in 20 countries. \"I have to say that Spencer Stuart does not speak to the press,\" sniffs a receptionist. Women top pay league The growth in trade has catapulted the headhunters themselves into the list of Britain's top earners. Last year a survey by research firm Heywood Associates found that the most successful can earn up to \u00a31.6m a year. Principals ask for a basic salary of \u00a3250,000 plus benefits and bonus, as the recruitment market for the recruiters becomes ever more competitive. Women are among the biggest earners. Anna Mann of stock market-listed agency Whitehead Mann is said to have placed more chief executives than anyone else in the country. Ffion Jenkins, Conservative leader William Hague's wife, is reputed to earn more than \u00a3100,000 per year at Leonard Hull, an agency set up by former journalist Carol Leonard. Philippa Rose, 41-year-old founder of the Rose Partnership, has been one of the leading specialists in the banking and finance sector since quitting Kleinwort Benson 20 years ago at the age of 22. With business booming, the headhunters are unlikely to be spending any time pondering whether they should seek a change of career.",

It may also be true that Marconi is bucking the trend, but it needs more market visibility. A trading update would settle the nerves.",

A statement could be released as early as today. The deal is the latest example of consolidation within the chemical sector which has seen rivals such as Ellis &amp; Everard and Laporte acquired by foreign rivals With Dow ready to pay upwards of 400p a share, the size of premium is expected to surprise many. Last night Ascot shares closed at 344p, up 5.5p, having moved steadily higher since the company announced it was in takeover talks with an unnamed suitor a week ago. The acquisition of Ascot would bring to a close the turnaround story which began in 1992 when executive chairman Howard Dyer was brought in to rescue Control Securities, a bankrupt property company. Mr Dyer renamed the company Ascot and started to dispose of its property and brewing assets, later deciding to focus on chemicals and engineering through the acquisition of Suter. The transformation of the company was completed last year when Ascot decided to sell its four engineering businesses to a management buyout team for \u00a345.6m and concentrate on chemicals. In the past few years it has been expanding its printing inks and pharmaceutical intermediates business. The acquisition of two pharma-technology companies, ChiroTech and Haltermann, were well received in the City. Dow Chemical is thought to have been primarily interested in Ascot's expertise in the pharma-technology sector ChiroTech is developing a technique that will allow it to make more powerful drugs.",

      "body": "<p>The demise of the pinstripe suit has hurt menswear retailer <strong> Moss Bros</strong>. Profits have fallen sharply and the company has been forced to take radical action. Chains such as Savoy Taylors Guild, The Suit Company and Blazer are disappearing, being replaced by more contemporary formats that appeal to the man who wears chinos and open necked shirts to work. </p> <p>But just recently the Moss Bros share price has started to tick higher on chatter that a mysterious investor is building a stake. </p> <p>Yesterday, the shares continued the advance, rising 4.5p, or 16.6%, to 31.5p, as the investor added to his position. This, traders said, followed heavy buying by the same investor on Tuesday. </p> <p>According to well informed sources, the mystery man believes current trading at Moss Bros has turned the corner. It is said that gross margins and like-for-like sales in the first eight weeks of the current fiscal year have improved, while Code, the new contemporary format, is achieving sales in line with expectations. </p> <p>Moss Bros will reveal all on Monday, when it delivers figures for the year to January 31. </p> <p>The day's other hot tales centred on <strong> Carphone Warehouse</strong> and aircraft seat maker <strong> Britax</strong>. </p> <p>Carphone shares lost 5.5p to 125p on speculation that joint broker CSFB had lowered its 2002 profits forecast by 8% to take account of slowing handset sales. Carphone shares floated at 195p in July. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Britax gained 5.5p to 120.5p on speculation that takeover talks, first revealed in January, are close to fruition. The gossips claim to have heard that an offer of around 130p has been accepted. </p> <p>Fears that FTSE-100's recent recovery had been nothing more than a \"dead cat bounce\" were partly realised yesterday as the blue chip index fell sharply, closing down 114.1 points at 5,614. </p> <p>Profits warnings from media company Disney, telecoms equipment maker Nortel, and handheld computer specialist Palm, which cast a shadow over Wall Street, were responsible for driving the index down. </p> <p>Traders were not surprised by the performance. \"We need signs of a turnaround from corporate America before this market recovers,\" one senior trader said. \"You get big rallies in bear markets.\" </p> <p>Elsewhere, the FTSE Tech mark 100 fell back 53.98 points to 1,980.16, with optical components maker <strong> Bookham</strong> tumbling 31.5p to 328.5p on the back of the Nortel profits warning. Dealers noted that 50% of Bookham's revenue comes from the Canadian company. FTSE 100 company <strong> Marconi</strong>, which competes with Nortel, was also suffering, losing 37p to 373p. </p> <p>Unsettled by the profits alert from Palm, rival <strong> Psion</strong> dropped 13p to 117.5p.

      "bodyText": "The demise of the pinstripe suit has hurt menswear retailer Moss Bros. Profits have fallen sharply and the company has been forced to take radical action. Chains such as Savoy Taylors Guild, The Suit Company and Blazer are disappearing, being replaced by more contemporary formats that appeal to the man who wears chinos and open necked shirts to work. But just recently the Moss Bros share price has started to tick higher on chatter that a mysterious investor is building a stake. Yesterday, the shares continued the advance, rising 4.5p, or 16.6%, to 31.5p, as the investor added to his position. This, traders said, followed heavy buying by the same investor on Tuesday. According to well informed sources, the mystery man believes current trading at Moss Bros has turned the corner. It is said that gross margins and like-for-like sales in the first eight weeks of the current fiscal year have improved, while Code, the new contemporary format, is achieving sales in line with expectations. Moss Bros will reveal all on Monday, when it delivers figures for the year to January 31. The day's other hot tales centred on Carphone Warehouse and aircraft seat maker Britax. Carphone shares lost 5.5p to 125p on speculation that joint broker CSFB had lowered its 2002 profits forecast by 8% to take account of slowing handset sales. Carphone shares floated at 195p in July. Meanwhile, Britax gained 5.5p to 120.5p on speculation that takeover talks, first revealed in January, are close to fruition. The gossips claim to have heard that an offer of around 130p has been accepted. Fears that FTSE-100's recent recovery had been nothing more than a \"dead cat bounce\" were partly realised yesterday as the blue chip index fell sharply, closing down 114.1 points at 5,614. Profits warnings from media company Disney, telecoms equipment maker Nortel, and handheld computer specialist Palm, which cast a shadow over Wall Street, were responsible for driving the index down. Traders were not surprised by the performance. \"We need signs of a turnaround from corporate America before this market recovers,\" one senior trader said. \"You get big rallies in bear markets.\" Elsewhere, the FTSE Tech mark 100 fell back 53.98 points to 1,980.16, with optical components maker Bookham tumbling 31.5p to 328.5p on the back of the Nortel profits warning. Dealers noted that 50% of Bookham's revenue comes from the Canadian company. FTSE 100 company Marconi, which competes with Nortel, was also suffering, losing 37p to 373p. Unsettled by the profits alert from Palm, rival Psion dropped 13p to 117.5p. Analysts said the fall was overdone because Psion had negligible exposure to North America. Back among the blue chips, semiconductor designer ARM Holdings ended 32.25p weaker at 315.75p with HSBC Securities said to have told its clients it sees downside risk to forecasts. HSBC's call followed a visit to ARM's customer base in North America. Vodafone eased 9p to 204p as Schroder Salomon Smith Barney lowered its target price to 220p. ITV company Carlton Communications shed 34p to 415p as short sellers targeted the stock on rumours that it has been hurt by the slowdown in advertising spending. Apparently a profits warning could be on the way. Among smaller companies, Britain's biggest owner of nursing homes, NHP, remained unchanged at 29.25p, although dealers think it is about to transfer the leases over 39 of its homes, worth \u00a3130m, from its struggling tenant Ultima to Southern Cross, the privately owned operator. On Aim, Lady in Leisure, the women-only fitness club operator, ticked up 5.5p to 11.5p on word that its advisers have finally lined up a buyer.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In 1858 the painter Augustus Egg portrayed himself in the character of David Fallen, a starving writer from a play by his friend Edward Bulwer-Lytton. Egg, in reality a successful bourgeois with a nice house in Kensington, imagined himself as a failure, dark-eyed and sallow-cheeked, scribbling desperately in a garret with his laundry hanging behind him. He envisaged the ultimate nightmare: that he himself lived the life of a Romantic artist, outside respectable society, without middle-class comforts - even anyone to wash his clothes. </p> <p>This is an unusual example from the many portraits of artists in the Museum of London's exhibition Creative Quarters: The Art World in London 1700-2000. Egg had a taste for morbid narrative and an overheated sense of the thinness of the line between the respectability he had achieved and what lay outside the parlour door. In the same year as he painted this self-portrait (commissioned by another painter, Patrick Allan, who escaped poverty only by marrying an heiress) Egg created the series of pictures for which he is best-known today. Past and Present I, II and III (1858), in Tate Britain, tell the story of a woman caught in adultery. Her sin leads, with melodramatic inevitability, to her ending up half-dead under a bridge by the Thames. </p> <p>Egg's vision of what happens when you step outside the parameters of middle-class morality is comic today, but it's interesting that he portrayed himself as Fallen at the same time as he painted the results of women's sexual transgression. This is the period in which two French artists were celebrating life outside middle-class constraints in their founding masterpieces of modernism: Courbet with The Painter's Studio (1855) and Manet with Olympia (1863). Egg imagines the avant-garde artist as a doomed figure and creativity itself as a moral temptation that he, for one, was prepared to resist. </p> <p>Creative Quarters reveals how deeply rooted this attitude was among British artists. It is not a story of wild social outlaws setting up their studios among the prostitutes, nightclub dancers and anarchist bomb-throwers, as Parisian artists did in Montmartre. From the moment London began to have an art world in the early 18th century, the ambition of artists was not to challenge society but to become part of it. They craved respectability, and this is revealed in their patterns of settlement. </p> <p>The first move artists made was out of the City of London, which smacked of their old, despised status as craftsmen belonging to the Paint-Stainers' guild. They wanted to redefine themselves as gentlemen who practised the liberal arts, so they moved west, where the gentlemen lived. </p> <p>West London was opened up as a posh commercial and residential territory, and artists settled in Covent Garden, which in the early 18th century was an aristocratic, stylish address. This story continued throughout the centuries to come: artists moved further and further west, buying country residences in Chiswick and Twickenham. </p> <p>Even the British version of bohemia was very comfortable, with Rossetti and Whistler opening up Chelsea as a chic district in the late 19th century. It wasn't until the 1950s that artists started to flirt with danger in the booze-sodden atmosphere of Francis Bacon's Soho - but even that was a piece of fantasy by artists who never thought of actually living amid the Soho sleaze. Instead, Bacon lived and worked in a very desirable mews house in Kensington. </p> <p>The Museum of London reconstructs this story of respectability and affluence with archeological precision. Yet if artists wanted nothing more than to avoid the garret, and if they really could imagine nothing more interesting than bourgeois comforts, there wouldn't be much interest in looking at British art before 1950. But there is. And a lot of it is about the dark side of London life. If British artists aspired to live in the smartest parts of the capital, to mix with the best people, they were also transfixed by low life. </p> <p>The fear and seduction of the gutter were there in the 18th century, in the work of William Hogarth. Hogarth was the defining spirit of London's art, central to the history of the city's \"creative quarters\". It was Hogarth who laid the foundations of art as a middle-class career. He was a self-made man whose pride in pulling himself up into the upper-middle class can be seen in his self-portrait The Painter with His Pug (1745), in Tate Britain. More than anyone, Hogarth established a market for British art. He found new ways to sell art not just to the aristocracy but to the new middle-class public, inventing a new genre - \"comic history painting\" - that had the same broad appeal as the contemporary novels of Defoe, Richardson and Fielding. </p> <p>Hogarth's visual narratives, such as The Rake's Progress (1733) and Marriage \u00e0 la Mode (before 1743), are novels told in a series of pictures. And just to make them even more exciting for a popular audience in 18th-century London, he set them all, in great topographical detail, in the city they knew and lived in. No costume dramas for this British film-maker before the invention of film. His art was available to almost all, thanks to cheap prints of his paintings. </p> <p>In 1731 Hogarth came to live in Covent Garden with his well-to-do father-in-law, the court painter James Thornhill; by 1733 he was able to afford his own house on Leicester Square. These were snooty addresses. Hogarth was one of the first wave of upwardly mobile artists, even buying a country house in then-rural Chiswick. But if he was proud, he was also anxious. If he was respectable, he was also fascinated by dirt. </p> <p>In fact, he engraved the definitive image of the starving creative artist in his London garret. Egg's Self-Portrait as David Fallen is a close reworking of Hogarth's print The Distressed Poet, published in 1737, with the same washing on the line. Hogarth's writer scratches his head under his askew wig, trying to think of some wonderful, saleable poem to get his family out of this attic room. It's the same nightmare that tormented Egg, but Hogarth had better reason to fear it. His own father, Richard Hogarth, was an impecunious, would-be literary man who never made a decent living and was for a time imprisoned for debt. At the age of 12 Hogarth himself saw the inside of the Fleet prison. </p> <p>In scene three of The Rake's Progress, we see the artist's anti-hero Tom Rakewell, having inherited his father's wealth and set up home in London, enjoying a night out at the Rose Tavern in Drury Lane. It's three in the morning, and the Rake has been out boozing and brawling - he wears a sword and rests a cudgel on the ground. The tavern is a prostitutes' hangout and two women are stealing his watch while he studies the entertainment. As one woman strips to her underwear, an employee brings in a candle and silver platter. This is for a performance in which the woman undressing will snuff out the candle during a simulated sex act. </p> <p>Hogarth loved this dirty town. His visual novels are terrifying - the Rake ends up first in debtor's prison and then in Bedlam and, in the fifth scene of Marriage \u00e0 la Mode, a man is murdered by his wife's lover after confronting them in a sex hotel or \"bagnio\". But they are also exuberantly comic. In Morning in Covent Garden, from his series The Four Times of The Day (1736) - painted not that long after he moved out of the square in 1733 - a thin old woman with her starveling servant boy walk across the square in front of the market at five minutes to eight, about to enter the classically porticoed St Paul's Church, still there today. Instead of today's tourists and buskers, the church-going representative of propriety is jeered at by a bunch of lowlifes who didn't go to bed at all last night - young bloods who make love to prostitutes right there in the middle of the square. </p> <p>In this confrontation of the church-going middle class and the city's dirty denizens there's no ambiguity about which side Hogarth is on. The woman resembles Lent, as personified as a thin old woman in prints by Brueghel and his imitators. The carousing, screwing lowlifes represent her antithesis: carnival. For Hogarth, London is a city of frolics where there are no rules. In the bagnio scene from Marriage \u00e0 la Mode, there is a crudely drawn graffito on the wall, representing the savagery underlying civilisation, but also associating art with low life. Again and again in Hogarth the instinct to make art is shown to be low, primitive and irrational. People draw caricatures on their hands when they are drunk and, in Bedlam, a maniac draws on the wall. </p> <p>British artists after Hogarth tried to imitate his economic success and, if they were any good, also turned to the filthy inspiration of the city. Some of them lived the life of the distressed poet in all its seedy details. In the early 19th century Benjamin Haydon tried to establish himself as a great history painter on a continental model, but in Britain there just wasn't the market or patronage for it, and he ended up in debtors' prison. There he turned to painting comic narrative scenes in the manner of Hogarth, although he never got out of debt and eventually killed himself. It was not until the second half of the 20th century that the spirit of avant-garde social dissidence finally found a market in Britain. Yet the great art of London since Hogarth belongs in the gutter, the brothel and the asylum. </p> <p>\u0095 Creative Quarters is at the Museum of London, London EC2 (020-7600 3699), from tomorrow until July 15. The Rake's Progress can be seen at Sir John Soane's Museum, London WC2 (020-7405 2107); Marriage \u00e0 la Mode is at the National Gallery, London WC2 (020-7747 2885).</p>",

There he turned to painting comic narrative scenes in the manner of Hogarth, although he never got out of debt and eventually killed himself. It was not until the second half of the 20th century that the spirit of avant-garde social dissidence finally found a market in Britain. Yet the great art of London since Hogarth belongs in the gutter, the brothel and the asylum. \u0095 Creative Quarters is at the Museum of London, London EC2 (020-7600 3699), from tomorrow until July 15.

His defiant reply denied any wrongdoing and questioned the legality and constitutionality of the efforts to oust him. Opposition party leaders' initial reaction was that even though Mr Wahid's response included a vague apology for \"inappropriate behaviour\", it was not enough to derail calls for a second warning to be issued next month. If the president fails to satisfy legislators within one month of the second memorandum being issued, they are entitled to start impeachment proceedings. In his 15-page address, delivered by the justice minister, Baharuddin Lopa, Mr Wahid, who was censured for his alleged role in two financial scandals in which \u00a34.25m disappeared, repeatedly stressed that the censure was \"baseless\", \"unobjective\" and \"completely out of proportion\" because the parliamentary investigating committee had found no proof linking him to the scams. \"It is hard not to see the censure as the result of a dislike of the president or aimed at toppling the president,\" Mr Wahid's reply said. \"The censure does not stand on the principle of justice.\" Most analysts agree that the opposition is using the scandals as an excuse to force Mr Wahid from office. The real source of discontent is Mr Wahid's erratic and ineffective governing style which has failed to end a three-year economic crisis, curb rampant corruption and prevent communal violence spreading across the archipelago. \"We heard nothing new today whatsoever,\" said Alvin Lie, one of Mr Wahid's harshest critics. \"He was just trying to defend himself.

      "bodyText": "The Zapatista leadership addressed an extraordinary session of Mexico's parliament called to hear their demands for constitutional recognition of the country's 10m indigenous people yesterday, without their iconic leader, Subcomandante Marcos. The rebel leadership filed into the huge chamber of deputies masked but unarmed. \"The subcomandante is just that, a sub, and we gave him the mission to bring us here. Now it's our hour,\" said Comandante Esther in the main Zapatista speech, which received a standing ovation. \"My name is Esther, but that's not important. I'm a Zapatista, but that's not important either. What is important is that I am indigenous and I am a woman and I am speaking in this symbolic place,\" she said. The Zapatista delegation was allowed 220 special guests in the parliamentary front row, many of whom wore traditional costume. Last night's session was due to last five hours, with the Zapatista leaders' speeches in favour of an indigenous rights bill granting autonomy to indigenous communities to be followed by questions. The bill's approval has been the rebels' key remaining condition for accepting President Vicente Fox's often repeated offer of peace talks anytime, anywhere. But last night Esther said initial contact with the government peace commission could start before that was achieved. Most parliamentarians from Mr Fox's conservative National Action party (Pan) had said they would boycott the session to display their distaste for the presence of masked rebels officially at war with the state, and their objection to what they view as the president's capitulation. The bill stems from a peace accord signed in February 1996 but blocked by the then president Ernesto Zedillo, prompting the Zapatistas to abandon negotiations. It was dusted off by Mr Fox who, despite the tensions within his own party, has made his search for peace in Chiapas a pillar of his claims to be dismantling the authoritarian structures of 71 years of one-party rule by the Institutional Revolutionary party. Marcos seized the opportunities presented by Mr Fox to break years of isolation in jungle strongholds and politically relaunch the militarily weak guerrilla faction. \"They no longer existed on the political agenda but now they have recouped an important place not only on the national agenda, but also internationally,\" said a political analyst, Carlos Elizondo. But since they arrived in Mexico City the going has got tougher for the Zapatistas, with Pan insisting that the rebels should only talk to small groups of deputies in back rooms. Other parties invited the Zapatistas to speak after Marcos had threatened to take his rebels home and was holding a \"goodbye\" rally in the city. In an interview given to the Colombian-born writer Gabriel Garcia Marques, Marcos said the Zapatistas were \"condemned to failure if we continue with an armed structure\". But before last night's session, Miguel Alvarez, who was a peace mediator in the early years of the conflict, had warned that even the approval of the bill, which is expected to be put to the vote next month, is no guarantee of a peace deal. \"It would be a further step, but Fox wants a quick peace deal while the Zapatistas want a more profound negotiation, and they are not in that much of a hurry,\" he said.",

Two other Britons remained hostage during a tense standoff between rival factions in the Somali capital. In Nairobi, in neighbouring Kenya, a UN spokeswoman, Sonya Green, said Jonathan Veitch, a Briton with the UN children's fund, Unicef, had been handed over to Somalia's transitional government along with an American colleague and three Europeans from French aid agency M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF). Last night Mr Veitch, 32, said: \"There's little I can say until my friends are released, but the two Britons there are two of the most experienced people we have in Somalia. We know where they are, and we know they're OK.\" The two Britons who remained hostage were yesterday named as Bill Condie and Roger Carter. MSF's Nairobi spokeswoman, Samantha Bolton, denied that the agency's workers had ever been held captive. \"Our staff were never hostages, they were just keeping out of the way at a local businessman's house,\" she said. \"The UN seems to have been sending out some conflicting signals.\" The aid workers spent the day at the Hotel Ramadan, which serves as the base for President Abdiqassim Salad Hassan in the absence of any government buildings left standing in the wartorn city. The UN and MSF both sent planes to bring the aid workers to Nairobi yesterday evening. UN sources said that four remaining UN hostages, two Britons, a Frenchman and a Belgian, were being held by fighters loyal to the warlord Musa Sude Yalahow. Mr Yalahow's men sparked Tuesday's conflict by attacking a rival militia employed as MSF's security guards. The UN and MSF staff, who had joined up to visit an MSF cholera vaccination project, became separated as Mr Yalahow's men ransacked the MSF compound. Ms Green said: \"The UN is in discussion about the four with faction leader Musa Sude Yalahow, who controls the area. We are not calling them hostages or kidnapped and we are not blaming Musa Sude. We are just talking to him because he controls the area.\" According to local reports, the captives were being held in two groups, with the British pair under guard in a garage in north Mogadishu, and the other two in Mr Yalahow's compound.

They were removed by the police during raucous and sometimes violent scuffles.</p> <p>Protesters at the top of the embankment chanted \"We are peaceful. What are you?\" as the police cleared the single track line.</p> <p>The police then pursued them across an open wheat field, away from the route due to be taken by the 60-tonne shipment.</p> <p>But within 20 minutes, knots of demonstrators had regrouped a few miles away in the hamlet of Eichdorf to stage another fleeting occupation of the line.</p> <p>At the Dannenberg railway terminus, which is sealed off with barbed wire, the six containers of waste produced by reprocessing spent fuel from German power plants will be loaded on flatbed trucks for the last leg of the from a French reprocessing plant.</p> <p>The journey is expected to be undertaken today.</p> <p>The final 12 miles through a thickly wooded area to the nuclear waste dump at Gorleben was the scene of clashes between the police and protesters during the last shipment four years ago.</p> <p>There is increasing political fallout from the protests, and the protesters were beginning to scent a kind of victory: one with potentially damaging consequences for Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's red-green coalition government.</p> <p>He already faces an uncomfortable parliamentary debate today when the Christian Democratic opposition will accuse his cabinet of bungling the resumption of shipments - suspended by the previous government in 1998 - and call on the Greens, the junior partners in the coalition, to distance themselves from the violent demonstrators.</p> <p>The Green environment minister, J\u00fcrgen Trittin, who authorised the resumption, faces a separate motion which could end his career in office.</p> <p>The underlying question is whether the authorities will press on with the shipments in the face of the determined opposition demonstrated this week.</p> <p>If the answer is no, the entire agreement to phase out nuclear power in Germany, of which this is an integral part, will be thrown into doubt. Though moderate Greens defend the agreement, radical opponents of nuclear power of the kind engaged in this week's protests regard it as a political sham.</p> <p>The Green party, which was divided even before this week's demonstrations, appears more split than ever on the issue. After members in Lower Saxony, the region where the demonstrations are taking place, called for the agreement to be rethought, the joint national leaders cancelled a visit to the area.

Even so, all four were taken to hospital on stretchers with suspected frostbite. \"I don't think that even these people expected it to last so long,\" a police spokesman said. The Robin Wood group has its origins in the fight to save German forests but has broadened its campaign to take in other issues. After the four were removed a crowd of several hundred gathered at the site and began to sit on the track for the best part of a quarter of a mile. They were removed by the police during raucous and sometimes violent scuffles. Protesters at the top of the embankment chanted \"We are peaceful. What are you?\" as the police cleared the single track line. The police then pursued them across an open wheat field, away from the route due to be taken by the 60-tonne shipment. But within 20 minutes, knots of demonstrators had regrouped a few miles away in the hamlet of Eichdorf to stage another fleeting occupation of the line. At the Dannenberg railway terminus, which is sealed off with barbed wire, the six containers of waste produced by reprocessing spent fuel from German power plants will be loaded on flatbed trucks for the last leg of the from a French reprocessing plant. The journey is expected to be undertaken today. The final 12 miles through a thickly wooded area to the nuclear waste dump at Gorleben was the scene of clashes between the police and protesters during the last shipment four years ago. There is increasing political fallout from the protests, and the protesters were beginning to scent a kind of victory: one with potentially damaging consequences for Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's red-green coalition government. He already faces an uncomfortable parliamentary debate today when the Christian Democratic opposition will accuse his cabinet of bungling the resumption of shipments - suspended by the previous government in 1998 - and call on the Greens, the junior partners in the coalition, to distance themselves from the violent demonstrators. The Green environment minister, J\u00fcrgen Trittin, who authorised the resumption, faces a separate motion which could end his career in office. The underlying question is whether the authorities will press on with the shipments in the face of the determined opposition demonstrated this week. If the answer is no, the entire agreement to phase out nuclear power in Germany, of which this is an integral part, will be thrown into doubt. Though moderate Greens defend the agreement, radical opponents of nuclear power of the kind engaged in this week's protests regard it as a political sham. The Green party, which was divided even before this week's demonstrations, appears more split than ever on the issue. After members in Lower Saxony, the region where the demonstrations are taking place, called for the agreement to be rethought, the joint national leaders cancelled a visit to the area. Several Green MPs say they will vote against Mr Trittin today If Mr Trittin loses the vote Mr Schr\u00f6der may be prompted to sack him. But government sources insisted yesterday that there would be no change in the policy towards nuclear energy and that the shipments would go ahead. \u0095 Hear John Hooper at the scene of the protests at Guardian Unlimited audio",

Zimbabwean troops took a heavy beating in an offensive against Rwandan troops late last year, shortly before the murder of Mr Kabila's father. \"The amount of equipment we captured indicated the Zimbabweans were planning a major move, probably into Burundi, using both Burundian and Interahamwe troops which they had newly trained,\" said Gen Kayumba.

Reports from barracks across the federation in Bosnia suggested that the majority of the 7,500 Croat soldiers in the 22,500 strong common army were joining the mutiny. On Monday, 1,900 Croat soldiers from the central town of Vitez had abandoned their posts. The mutiny follows the establishment of a Croat national congress three weeks ago, which has called on all Croats to leave their jobs in the federation army, police and other public offices. The aim of the congress is to establish a \"third entity\" or Croat statelet in Bosnia, leaving the Muslims stranded in a small enclave between Serbs and Croats. Officials representing the international community in Bosnia have described the events as the most serious threat to the unity of Bosnia since the 1995 Dayton accords which ended the war. \"This is an extremely worrying development. We are trying to outstare them, but at the moment, we are not staring hard enough,\" said one western diplomat in Sarajevo. Under Dayton, Bosnia was divided into two halves, the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Serbian Republic, each with considerable decisionmaking powers but the skeleton of a central state holding them together. Muslims and Croats began the war together in 1992, fighting the attempt by Serb extremists to destroy the newly recognised country. But following Serb successes, and assuming the partition of the country was inevitable, Croats turned on their Muslim allies in 1993. Following intense international pressure, in particular from the US, an alliance between Muslims and Croats was eventually patched up in 1994, and the two armies finished the war together. But hardline Croats, especially in Herzegovina, have never abandoned their dream of forming their own separate state called Herzeg-Bosna. \"Any attempt to establish parallel structures is illegal, and anti-Dayton,\" Chris Bird, the spokesman for the High Representative in Sarajevo, said yesterday. \"We call on all members of the federation army to remain loyal to their legally appointed commanders.\" But that appeal seemed to be falling on deaf ears. Most Croat generals are said to have walked out with their men. In the police force, officers in largely Croat areas have for years ignored a law requiring them to wear Bosnian insignia alongside the chequer-board Croat badge on their uniforms. But western officials yesterday drew some comfort from the fact that an estimated 250 Croats working in the federation interior ministry in Sarajevo have not responded to the nationalist call to abandon their posts. Police and soldiers have been warned that anyone who joins the illegal Croat structures will lose their jobs, pay and pension rights in the federation. The key question is whether the Croat soldiers have left to set up a new army, with access to weapons, or whether they are simply going to \"run around the woods in blue jeans\", as a diplomatic source put it. \"We don't have any information about soldiers leaving barracks with their weapons,\" Colonel Alain Ollivier, the deputy chief press officer for S-For, the Nato-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia, said yesterday. \"This is a political issue which needs a political response.\"",

      "bodyText": "Jacques Chirac yesterday refused to be questioned as a witness by a magistrate investigating a massive kickback scandal allegedly run from Paris town hall while he was mayor, sparking a furious row over France's laws on presidential immunity. The summons, the first sent to a head of state during the Fifth Republic, was posted to the Elys\u00e9e Palace last week by Eric Halphen, a judge investigating claims that the town hall under Mr Chirac creamed some \u00a360m off public building and maintenance contracts in the 1980s and early 1990s - the vast majority of it going straight into the coffers of the president's conservative RPR party. In an unprecedented pre-dawn statement, Mr Chirac's office responded to news of the summons by insisting that \"in view of the constitutional rules, he cannot answer this summons, which is contrary to the principle of the separation of powers and to the demands of the continuity of the state\". It added that Mr Chirac, mayor of Paris from 1977 until his election as president in 1995, would have spoken to judges about the case already if he had any information on it. Mr Chirac later fired off an angry letter to the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, denouncing the publication of the news as a violation of judicial secrecy and calling on him to \"take all useful measures within his powers to ensure the constitution is respected\". The summons is a severe embarrassment in the week after the RPR lost control of Paris in local elections that were dominated by mounting evidence of corruption at the town hall during Mr Chirac's tenure. A formal judicial request for the president to present himself for questioning became almost inevitable after last year's publication of an extraordinary beyond-the-grave confession by a former property developer and prominent RPR fundraiser, Jean-Claude M\u00e9ry. Mr M\u00e9ry, who died in 1999, accused Mr Chirac in a videotape recorded in 1996 of setting up the covert fund-raising system. \"We worked only on orders from Mr Chirac,\" he said, adding that on one occasion he personally handed \u00a3500,000 to a top town hall aide in the presence of Mr Chirac. The president has repeatedly denied any part in half a dozen town hall sleaze scandals currently under investigation, using a television appearance in December to dismiss out of hand all the charges made against him. But the scandal may prove damaging to his re-election hopes in next year's presidential poll: surveys suggest 80% of the French think Mr Chirac \"should testify\" if asked to, while 71% feel it is \"not right\" that the former mayor of Paris should be immune from prosecution as president. A 1999 ruling by the constitutional council stated that a president could not be placed under formal investigation as long as he was in office, although experts disagree over whether the ruling applies to a summons to appear as a witness. The president's RPR defenders accused judge Halphen of politically-motivated and illegal behaviour. \"He knows very well that this kind of summons is unlawful and unconstitutional,\" said the party spokesman, Patrick Devedjian. But a leading Green politician, Yves Contassot, said everybody knew that Mr Chirac would have to talk to the judges sooner or later, \"so it's good news that a judge dared to challenge his refusal to testify. By refusing to talk, he looks like someone who's afraid to talk\".",

      "bodyText": "A group of Israeli schoolchildren were drawn into a tragedy at a roadside stop called Peace Rendezvous yesterday when a suicide bomber sidled into their midst and blew himself up, killing two of the children and injuring four. After six months of the Palestinian uprising many people are numb in the face of almost daily casualties - but yesterday's attack stands out because the victims were children. So were the victims on the other side of the confrontation yesterday. In Rafah, on the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt, a Palestinian child of nine was killed and three others - all under 12 - were injured when they played too close to an unexploded Israeli shell lying in one of the few bits of open ground in the squalid town of open sewers and refugee shanties. People in Rafah said such injuries were becoming common, with soldiers from the adjoining Israeli army base regularly shelling houses that back on to the concrete blocks marking the border. For the seven Israeli schoolboys yesterday there was no indication of danger when they assembled in a car park in central Israel just before 8am. The Peace Rendezvous is a grand name for a petrol station and transport cafe flanked by palm trees, lying between the central Israeli city of Kfar Sava and the West Bank town of Qalqilya. The boys waited there every day for their school bus - an armoured vehicle in this case - because they leave their homes inside Israel to study at a religious seminary in Kedumim, a hardline Jewish settlement. Moments before the explosion at least one of the pupils noticed a man in his late 20s, with black hair and a moustache, drawing near, his black leather jacket zipped up to the neck despite the heat wave. \"Suddenly an Arab came up to my friends. He looked suspicious. Then I heard an explosion,\" Rafael Zomer, 15, told Israel Radio. \"I saw my friends blown apart.\" The bomb, strapped to the extremist's body under his jacket, spewed nails and metal into the group, killing Naftali Landskoren, 14, and Eliran Rosenberg, 16. Doctors operated for several hours on one of the four wounded. Another boy was pierced in the eye. The one boy unscathed was standing away from the others. \"My friends were gathering at a corner of the gas station when the explosion happened. When I opened my eyes, I saw the ground was strewn with bodies and injured people,\" he said. Within hours the armed wing of the Islamist militant group Hamas claimed responsibility for the bombing and said there were more horrors to come. \"The elite unit 103 returned to base safely after moving the martyr [bomber] to the place of the operation,\" said a caller to Reuters news agency. \"There are still seven martyrs ready to strike.\" This bombing - the third in 24 hours - brought a deepening sense of dread among Israelis that they and their children can never be safe while the Palestinian uprising goes on. There was an inevitability about Israel's first response: to surround Qalqilya with soldiers and tanks and mount a helicopter search for a suspicious van seen speeding from the car park around the time of the explosion. Meanwhile, the Palestinians had new sources of grievance against Israel's continued occupation of parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In the Jenin area, at the northern reaches of the West Bank, an elderly Palestinian woman suffocated after inhaling tear gas from a cannister thrown into her home. In Hebron extremist Jewish settlers from the 400-member enclave that festers in the heart of the Palestinian city of 120,000 went on the rampage for a second day, burning shops, homes and vehicles.

Elizabeth Hurley, no stranger to a bit of cleavage herself, once commented on Rosie's embonpoint, \"I couldn't help noticing that woman ... doesn't she have wonderful breasts?\" Millard is also the subject of a devoted website, extolling her as \"curvaceous, demure and ultimately very sexy\". Any other admirers? Actually, it was thanks to that dress that Rosie got her report done at all. Elton John doesn't normally allow press into the party but, Rosie recounted: \"They looked at me in that striking dress and just waved me through.\" And who can blame them? So you see, it was all in the name of duty. And rather timely to. After all, it is National Cleavage Day tomorrow. Mind you, I've never seen Barry Norman in a revealing little number at the Oscars ... Let's not even think about it. Not to be confused with: Jordan. Who's Jordan? Never mind.",

Badcock is standing outside a high-security prison talking into a mobile phone after a visit to a dangerous remand prisoner. He is reporting back to one of England's three special hospitals, where he helps to treat some of the country's most violent and dangerous patients. For a moment, untypically, he slips into street language. \"I've just seen this guy and he's a total whacko,\" he shouts above the traffic. \"He scares the shit out of me, I can tell you.\"</p> <p>Back at the hospital, the more characteristic side of Badcock comes to the fore as he sits with a young man whose problem is that he keeps getting into fights. Badcock talks to him in an easy, neutral voice: \"Now, we've had some treatments focusing on that psychologically, and I want to talk through a lot of issues with you and to put you on some different tablets. Do you feel mentally prepared to cope with that, and with life on a different ward?\" The patient mumbles a reply, hands clasped between his knees and head bowed.</p> <p>That is the day job. By night, Badcock is often busy on something related, but more extreme: he goes up to his study, settles at his desk, and pores over documents from the latest cases with which he is helping police - cases in which aggression has spilled over into murder, rape and unspeakable deeds. The documents include photographs of the kind sometimes shown to juries at the start of criminal trials. Photos which make them wince and turn away.</p> <p>As one of the country's foremost offender profilers, Badcock is a real life version of Fitz, the character played by Robbie Coltrane in the television drama Cracker. But while Fitz was a testy genius flawed by gambling and alcohol, Badcock is a mild-mannered, almost Dickensian figure with a ready laugh and a surprisingly cherubic smile. He often wears a bow tie and a flower in his buttonhole, and his penchant for quotations from Socrates or William of Occam has been known to leave policemen looking a little blank.</p> <p>Cracker was broadcast just after Badcock began profiling work, and he enjoyed it. But he says it gave a misleading impression of profiling work to police officers as well as the public, and he and his colleagues have been trying to correct it ever since. \"It was right, though, in saying that intuition plays an important part in developing knowledge of a case,\" he says. \"The only thing is that it must be trained intuition.\"</p> <p>As well as studying the documents and photographs, he has briefings with police officers, visits the scene of the crime, and usually re-enacts the crime in the attempt to get inside the mind of the offender: policemen tend to get embarrassed as he lies down in a field or rehearses the swing of the arm which held the murder weapon. He then offers the police his insights about what kind of person might have done it: his age, job, family situation, psychosexual makeup, likely history of offending, and probable future behaviour.</p> <p>But it's an article of faith with him that the senior officers on any case can take or leave any information he offers them and all decisions must be made by police officers. And he is adamant that a profile should never be treated as evidence: \"If they say to me, 'Well, Joe Bloggs fits this profile exactly, surely that means he's it?' I say 'No, it doesn't, because you don't know whether Fred Smith two doors down the road isn't exactly the same - and totally innocent as well.'</p> <p>\"Profiling is not about identifying individuals. It's about identifying characteristics of the offenders from the offences. If you've got a list of suspects, then the profile is quite useful in prioritising the investigation, but there has to be real evidence as well.\"</p> <p>His approach to profiling is hard to define, because it treats each case as unique and draws on reasoning, experience and intuition: \"It's a bit like intelligence - everybody knows what you mean, but if you try and define it, it's actually quite difficult.\"</p> <p>Just how useful his insights are is a moot point. The limited research into offender profiling indicates that there are very few cases where the profiler produces the kind of blinding, Crackeresque insights which lead straight to the criminal. But it also shows that investigating officers like to have an intelligent outsider to share ideas with, and that a profile can reduce the suspect list and help with arrest and interviewing strategy. Nowadays profilers are used in most serious crimes where there's no obvious suspect within 48 hours.</p> <p>Among cases Badcock has dealt with are the rape and murder of a young legal assistant, Yvonne Killian, in south London in 1998, and the murder of Dr Joan Francisco in 1994. Currently he is working on a murder, an attempted murder and a suspicious death.</p> <p>Such a life means constant exposure to destruction and depravity for Badcock and the 20 other profilers used regularly by English police forces. Badcock has been doing it for eight years, and it has turned him into a vegetarian: \"The last thing I want is more destruction on my plate.\" It has also made him very conscious of the need to leaven his life with other activities. \"It' s a bit like what Nietzsche said about looking into the abyss,\" he says. \"It has an effect on you - not so much depressing as isolating, because it somehow separates you from your own humanity.\"</p> <p>So if you ring him at the weekend he is likely to be up on the roof repairing the slates or at his woodworking bench.

The shadows are still there, however: back at the church hall, his forehead sprouting sweat after a vigorous jig, he reaches into his sporran, a propos of nothing, and brings out a silver Greek coin.

As Howard Stableford discovers in <strong> Changing Places</strong> (4.0pm, Radio 4), Nick White and his neighbours have put the greater part of their homes underground. This lets them maintain a comfortable inside temperature without artificial heating. Getting their hot water through solar power has also saved them another \u00a31,000 a year. </p> <p>Ray Galton was given six weeks to live when he was admitted as a priority case to a tuberculosis sanatorium. Alan Simpson arrived 18 months later, and their joint boredom led them to write comedy scripts for the hospital's internal radio. Paul Jackson helps them recall the story for <strong> In Conversation With...</strong> (6.30pm, Radio 4). Inspiration vanished after four episodes, so they wrote to Frank Muir and Denis Norden asking for tips. The professionals' response led them into a script-writing career which generated 600 radio and television shows, including Hancock's Half Hour and Steptoe And Son. </p> <p>Andy Hamilton, playing the Devil, launches a new series of his patchy sitcom <strong> Old Harry's Game</strong> (11.0pm, Radio 4). This first episode is lively enough, with plenty of neat one-liners about life in Hell. But will the standard decline as quickly and disappointingly as it did in earlier series?</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you are searching for the cluster of houses recently built near the Nottinghamshire village of Hockerton you're likely to see no more than a hummock in a field. As Howard Stableford discovers in Changing Places (4.0pm, Radio 4), Nick White and his neighbours have put the greater part of their homes underground. This lets them maintain a comfortable inside temperature without artificial heating. Getting their hot water through solar power has also saved them another \u00a31,000 a year. Ray Galton was given six weeks to live when he was admitted as a priority case to a tuberculosis sanatorium. Alan Simpson arrived 18 months later, and their joint boredom led them to write comedy scripts for the hospital's internal radio. Paul Jackson helps them recall the story for In Conversation With... (6.30pm, Radio 4). Inspiration vanished after four episodes, so they wrote to Frank Muir and Denis Norden asking for tips. The professionals' response led them into a script-writing career which generated 600 radio and television shows, including Hancock's Half Hour and Steptoe And Son. Andy Hamilton, playing the Devil, launches a new series of his patchy sitcom Old Harry's Game (11.0pm, Radio 4). This first episode is lively enough, with plenty of neat one-liners about life in Hell. But will the standard decline as quickly and disappointingly as it did in earlier series?",

For centuries, scientists have sought to unlock the secrets of generation from pondlife. </p> <p> The great 18th century microscopist Spallanzani studied tadpoles to learn about evolution, in the strict sense of \"unfolding\" or \"development\". Like many scientists of his day, Spallanzani thought that all features of the embryo arrived preformed, either in the sperm or the egg - there was great debate between the opposing schools of \"animalculists\" (who supported sperm) and \"ovists\" (the league of egg men.) Some preformationists thought that the \"germs\" of animals nested one inside the other, each waiting its turn to be born, like an infinite regression of Russian dolls. </p> <p>A confirmed egg man himself, Spallanzani declared in 1768 that he had seen the form of a tadpole inside the egg of a frog even before the male arrived to fertilise it. It took a few more decades, and the arrival of \"nature philosophers\" such as Goethe, to put the idea of preformation to a deserved death, and for the word \"evolution\" to acquire the meaning it has today. Although Charles Darwin, did not use the word \"evolution\" in this sense in the Origin of Species, preferring the less ambiguous term \"descent with modification\", he accorded ponds a special place as perhaps the primary habitat of all life. </p> <p>He speculated that the ultimate ancestor of all living creatures received the vital spark in some \"warm little pond\". Such warm ponds can still have things to say about evolution. In a corner of what is now China, one pond, no bigger than an average garden ornamentation, squirmed with at least two sorts of salamander, both adults and larvae, when around 150 million years ago it was suddenly filled with hot ash from the eruption of a nearby volcano. </p> <p>The animals, far from living up to their alchemical reputations as creatures sustained by fire, perished in a salamandrine Pompeii. Excavated today, the pond has produced more than 500 of the oldest known salaman der skeletons found anywhere in the world. Ke-Qin Gao of the American Museum of Natural History, New York, and Neil Shubin of the University of Chicago describe the fossils in today's Nature. The first lesson to be learned from the Chinese salamanders is that, unlike frogs, they have changed very little in their general form for hundreds of millions of years. </p> <p>Also preserved in the Chinese fossil assemblage is their tendency towards neoteny. That is, some species of salamander become sexually mature while still in the aquatic, larval state. A good example of this is the axolotl salamander from Mexico that can breed quite happily without ever becoming fully adult (Spallanzani would have gone into transports of preformational delight). Other salamanders, however, such as the our own native newts, turn into fully air-breathing adults and shed their gills. Gao and Shubin reveal both kinds of salamander in their fossil pond. </p> <p> One kind, Sinerpeton fengshanensis, was like an axolotl in that it had the fully-formed bones of an adult as well as bony supports for external gills - there are even faint traces of the delicate, feathery gills themselves. Another salamander, Laccotriton subsolanus, seems to have developed fully into the adult state. The sheer number of specimens in the Chinese pond will give scope for researchers to study another peculiarity of salamanders - their capacity for variation. </p> <p> Shubin is one of a band of researchers interested in the question of whether variation between individuals in the same species can reveal anything about the evolutionary process as a whole. The Chinese fossils could add the important extra dimension of time. Shubin and others have shown that salamanders can vary hugely in the numbers of bones individual animals have in their limbs - even when the salamanders concerned belong to the same or closely related species. This line of study is important because variation is the essential substrate for evolution. </p> <p>Without variation, natural selection would have nothing to select and evolution would stop. This begs the question of what generates variation. Darwin died before a mechanism for the generation of variation had been discovered - as a result, natural selection fell from favour in the years immediately following his death. It reached its nadir in the 1890s when English biologist William Bateson penned a huge and, at the time, quixotic tome called Materials for the Study of Variation , whose aim was to enumerate and classify all the different kinds of natural variation in the hope of shedding light on its source. A few years later, however, the answer came in the form of genetics - a word coined by Bateson. </p> <p>In a sense, the possession of genes, collected into an entity called the genome, suggests that preformationists such as Spallanzani were at least partly right. The black spot in the centre of a frog's egg, before the sperm arrives, is not a preformed tadpole waiting for the spark of maleness to set it in motion. It does, however, contain the genome of the mother frog, inherited from her mother, and in turn from a heritage of frogs, frog ancestors, fish ancestors and vertebrate ancestors, all the way back to that warm little pond of which Darwin dreamed. It also realised - if only poetically - the slogan attributed to the great 16th century physician William Harvey: \"Ex Ovo, Omnia\": Everything comes from the egg. </p> <p> \u0095 Henry Gee is a senior editor of Nature. His book Deep Time: Cladistics, the Revolution in Evolution is out in paperback, from Fourth Estate.</p>",

Darwin died before a mechanism for the generation of variation had been discovered - as a result, natural selection fell from favour in the years immediately following his death. It reached its nadir in the 1890s when English biologist William Bateson penned a huge and, at the time, quixotic tome called Materials for the Study of Variation , whose aim was to enumerate and classify all the different kinds of natural variation in the hope of shedding light on its source. A few years later, however, the answer came in the form of genetics - a word coined by Bateson. In a sense, the possession of genes, collected into an entity called the genome, suggests that preformationists such as Spallanzani were at least partly right. The black spot in the centre of a frog's egg, before the sperm arrives, is not a preformed tadpole waiting for the spark of maleness to set it in motion. It does, however, contain the genome of the mother frog, inherited from her mother, and in turn from a heritage of frogs, frog ancestors, fish ancestors and vertebrate ancestors, all the way back to that warm little pond of which Darwin dreamed. It also realised - if only poetically - the slogan attributed to the great 16th century physician William Harvey: \"Ex Ovo, Omnia\": Everything comes from the egg. \u0095 Henry Gee is a senior editor of Nature. His book Deep Time: Cladistics, the Revolution in Evolution is out in paperback, from Fourth Estate.",

In Europe, it is the person initiating the call who pays. In other words, initially at least, in Europe fixed line users subsidised the mobile phone industry but Americans made a conscious decision for that not to happen. You can argue the pros and cons of that but to condemn the Americans as less advanced for doing what they did is simply ridiculous. </p> <p>The implication is that people \"must\" have mobiles to be considered advanced. The use of such criteria at least calls into question the entire basis of the ISI and at worst invalidates it entirely. </p> <p>Declaration of interest: I have never had a mobile phone and hope it will be a long time indeed before I do. <br> <strong> Frank Desmond</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:frank.d@ireland.com\">frank.d@ireland.com</a> </p> <p><strong> Go slow</strong><br> Living in an ADSL trial area since 1998, I expected that it would be easy for me to move to Openworld.

      "bodyText": "US backward? Online reported last week: \"Sweden scores highly in the Information Society Index (ISI) because of the number of telephone lines and mobile phones in use\". Why is mobile phone use taken as such a yardstick given that the US, especially, is a spectacular exception to such \"rules\"? Mobile phone use in the US is less than that in other advanced countries because the regulatory authority decided that a call from a fixed line to a mobile should be paid for by the mobile user. In Europe, it is the person initiating the call who pays. In other words, initially at least, in Europe fixed line users subsidised the mobile phone industry but Americans made a conscious decision for that not to happen. You can argue the pros and cons of that but to condemn the Americans as less advanced for doing what they did is simply ridiculous. The implication is that people \"must\" have mobiles to be considered advanced. The use of such criteria at least calls into question the entire basis of the ISI and at worst invalidates it entirely. Declaration of interest: I have never had a mobile phone and hope it will be a long time indeed before I do. Frank Desmond frank.d@ireland.com Go slow Living in an ADSL trial area since 1998, I expected that it would be easy for me to move to Openworld. BT was happy to accept my order, but for four months \"administrative procedures\" have prevented its execution. The trial failed a couple of months ago and as far as BT is concerned that's that.

Tens of millions of people still use proprietary mail services that do not follow internet standards, such as America Online's AOL Mail. Many more millions use dedicated email software such as Eudora, though by far the most common system now is Microsoft's Outlook Express. </p> <p>The disadvantage with web-based mail services such as Microsoft's Hotmail is that users tend to stay online while they read and reply to letters. This can take hours. It can also result in high telephone charges for time online. Of course, you can write mail offline, in a word processor, then copy and paste it into a message window, but not many people do. </p> <p>Dedicated email software works in a different way: it collects letters in batches from a mailbox. </p> <p>The mailbox is an electronic pigeonhole on a central computer called a server. When someone sends you email, that is where it is stored. Your email software connects to the mail server, downloads messages to your personal computer, and puts them into an inbox. </p> <p>You can either trigger a mail collection manually, or set your mail software to dial up at regular intervals. When mail arrives, you can read and reply to it offline (while not connected to the internet). Because your mail is on your computer, you can keep as much as you like, and take back-up copies for security. </p> <p>Email software provides other features that allow you to take control of your mail. For example, you should be able to set up \"filters\" or \"rules\" that treat certain types of mail in different ways. You could have mail from your boss downloaded into a separate folder, for example. You could also have any email that includes an attachment above a certain size (500K is reasonable) deleted automatically. </p> <p>Mail servers use two standard internet protocols: POP3 and SMTP. POP3 (Post Office Protocol) is used for storing email and enabling you to collect it. The server uses SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to send email to other servers. You need to know the addresses for both. Your ISP (internet service provider) usually tells you what they are, but they are often easy to guess. </p> <p>Examples of POP3 addresses include pop3. btclick.com , pop.freeserve. net , and pop.mail.yahoo.com . </p> <p>To set up a service in Outlook Express 5, go to the Tools menu, select Accounts, and click on the tab marked Mail. Next click the button at the top right, marked Add, and select Mail from the pop-up menu. After that, the wizard will take you through the process. </p> <p>Step one: type in the name you want shown, and click Next. Step two: type or paste in your email address on the service you want to use (joe.bloggs@btclick. com) and click Next. Step three: type or paste in the POP3 and SMTP addresses for incoming ( pop3.btclick.com ) and outgoing ( smtp.btclick. com ) mail and click Next. Step four: type in your account name and password, and click Next. </p> <p>If you have done everything right, you have now set up a POP3 account, so click Finish and close the tabbed dialogue box. You can now send and receive messages. </p> <p>To write a letter, click on the New Mail icon, or press Ctrl-N. </p> <p>If you already have other email services installed, such as Hotmail, you can select the new one from the drop-down menu at the right hand end of the From: line. </p> <p>When you have finished, press Alt-S to save the message in your Outbox, ready for sending. </p> <p>To send and receive mail, simply click the Send and Receive icon. Your letter will be sent, and the copy moved to the Sent folder. If you have more than one mail service, select Tools | Send and Receive then choose the one you want from the drop-down list, or click the small arrow next to the Send and Receive icon.

This is important. If you get a lot of \"spam\" (unwanted commercial email) you may want to delete it quickly, without the message being displayed in the \"preview pane\". You can do this by unticking the box next to \"Show preview pane\". This will also enable you to delete some mail messages that may otherwise try to dial out. </p> <p>The Layout box also lets you decide whether or not to show contacts from the address book, which toolbars to display, and so on. </p> <p>Most other settings are stored under Tools | Options, including Mail sending format. This lets you select either HTML or Plain Text as the default. HTML or \"rich text\" means you can use web-style formatting with different sizes, types and colours for text; you can also include images. </p> <p>Unfortunately, it also means your messages will be larger and more complicated, and may arrive as an attachment the recipient cannot read. </p> <p>\"Netiquette\" demands that you should never reply to a plain text message in HTML, or send attachments without asking first. </p>",

I remember a senior journalist entering the room once and asking him simply: \"How do you get all these exclusives?\" Looking up momentarily from a ream of papers, he waved his arm at the shelves stacked with letters, bills and Hansards and said: \"I read!\" </p> <p>He always kept an eye open for young reporters who worked with him, making sure they were happy, watching over the progress of their journalism, and taking a fatherly interest in their lives. How immensely refreshing it was to realise that you didn't have to be intimidated or rattled by Bevins - you just had to tell it like it was. </p> <p><b> Richard Glasstone writes:</b> There is one aspect about the life of Ninette de Valois (obituary, March 9) which deserves to be more widely known: her work in Turkey. I saw at first hand something of the miracle she brought about there: a Turkish national ballet academy (with full-time dance and education training); a professional national ballet company with an international repertoire; the nurturing of indigenous Turkish choreographers, composers and designers; and the creation of a ballet audience which now supports three full-time companies and several smaller groups. All this in a country with no previous interest in ballet - arguably an even more impressive achievement than her magnificent one in Britain. </p>",

I remember a senior journalist entering the room once and asking him simply: \"How do you get all these exclusives?\" Looking up momentarily from a ream of papers, he waved his arm at the shelves stacked with letters, bills and Hansards and said: \"I read!\" He always kept an eye open for young reporters who worked with him, making sure they were happy, watching over the progress of their journalism, and taking a fatherly interest in their lives. How immensely refreshing it was to realise that you didn't have to be intimidated or rattled by Bevins - you just had to tell it like it was. Richard Glasstone writes: There is one aspect about the life of Ninette de Valois (obituary, March 9) which deserves to be more widely known: her work in Turkey. I saw at first hand something of the miracle she brought about there: a Turkish national ballet academy (with full-time dance and education training); a professional national ballet company with an international repertoire; the nurturing of indigenous Turkish choreographers, composers and designers; and the creation of a ballet audience which now supports three full-time companies and several smaller groups. All this in a country with no previous interest in ballet - arguably an even more impressive achievement than her magnificent one in Britain.",

As a result: \"The man who had wooed me was back.\"</p> <p>More interesting than Doyle's own marital triumph is the size of her following.

A surrendered wife can earn as much as or more than her husband. Surrendering doesn't mean being a doormat, it means relinquishing inappropriate control. Control is the enemy of intimacy.

How can Doyle advise them to give it away?</p> <p>\"By giving up control, you gain power,\" she says simply.</p> <p>Doyle does not fit my mental picture of a \"surrendered wife\". Throughout our first meeting, her husband jumps up and down to the buffet, getting her whatever she tells him she wants. Sometimes she doesn't even have to tell him. His greatest wish seems to be to make her happy.</p> <p>It was not always the case. Both agree their marriage was on the brink of collapse. John felt he could not do anything right, so why bother trying? He sulked, while Laura saw him as incompetent and unloving. Then she decided to try something different.

It's about concentrating on the haves, rather than the have-nots.\"</p> <p>Critics have accused Doyle of creating a new breed of Stepford wives, but none of the women I met was remotely brainwashed. Take Connie, Tammy and Merilee, the women we filmed at Doyle's four-week workshop. For all of them, to coin a Californian phrase, \"control was an issue\".</p> <p>To put it bluntly, they were \"ball breakers\", incapable of \"obeying\" anyone for a day, let alone a lifetime. And this is the interesting thing: while the coverage Doyle generates tends to take a hard line - \"Wives surrender all to cult of obedience\" was a recent headline in the Times - the women drawn to her philosophy are for the most part successful women who display considerable control over their lives, but who clearly feel their desire to control is screwing up their relationship.</p> <p>Forty-year-old Tammy constantly nags husband Ben to lose weight. He is so dispirited by her criticism that their sex life has become nonexistent. Fifty-year-old Connie runs her own company and is a self-confessed control freak.

But they clearly recognise Doyle's diagnosis that too much control can destroy relationships and by the end of the course, all claim to have improved theirs.</p> <p>Doyle is often accused of turning back the clock, but she is not turning it back to the 50s, as her critics have said; rather she is turning it back to the early days of a relationship, to the time when you were so in love that you chose to see only the best in your partner. Of course, this works only if both parties love each other. Doyle's caveat - ignored by her critics - is that if you are with somone who is violent, an addict or a serial adulterer, not only should you not surrender, you should get out quick. But how would you realise if you were simply in the wrong relationship? Surrendering seems to imply the problem is with the woman, not with the pairing.</p> <p>I have now been married for a year and people often ask if my encounter with surrendering has influenced me. The answer is, undoubtedly, yes. As the gloss of newly wedded bliss wears off, I make a conscious effort to hold on to the \"in love\" me and not descend to the \"you can't do a thing right\" me that has been the hallmark of my past relationships. I have learnt that being opinionated, bossy and belligerent does not get me far in my marriage.</p> <p>I tried a modest \"surrendering\" experiment. I always used to moan when my husband came back late from work. Then I tried substituting \"You're always late\" with \"I love it when you come home early\".

      "bodyText": "\"It's a mythic epic narrative which has at its centre a female consciousness. In all the great epics, from the Iliad on, the protagonists have been masculine, their destinies a masculine destiny. Now a real shift is taking place, in which some collective identities - those created for the whole culture, regardless of gender - are female\" James Schamus, a writer and producer of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, on the film's success, Time \"At a time when men are famously losing out to women in schools and the workplace, it's easy to see why Gladiator's celebration of unreconstructed masculinity holds a profound appeal for men. The real suprise is that it seems to appeal at least equally to women. The emergence of Maximus as the first romantic icon of the 21st century suggests that many women feel a secret attraction for the old days when men were real men, husbands and fathers. All that remains to be seen is whether Gladiator is a nostalgic memory of maleness past or a portent of a masculine resurgence\" Christopher Tookey on Gladiator's success, Daily Mail \"Roman historians and artists may have exaggerated her beauty as a sort of propaganda tool to suggest that she must have used feminine wiles to entrap powerful Roman men\" Dr Nigel Strudwick of the Egyptian department of the British Museum on the news that Cleopatra was probably short, dumpy and rather plain, Daily Express \"It just doesn't encourage a balanced view of the body.

Some of the pictures once hung in Sutton Place, a vast Tudor mansion set in 775 acres of Surrey countryside. Mr Seeger bought it for \u00a38m from the estate of oil tycoon John Paul Getty in 1976, redecorated it, and hung some of his finest paintings including a Bacon triptych.

      "body": "<p>England may yet get to next year's World Cup in the Far East, but at the moment their journey is alternating dizzily between jumbo jet and Chinese junk. </p> <p> Last night's victory over Albania means that in the space of five days Sven-Goran Eriksson has achieved maximum points from his two qualifiers to repair much of the damage caused by Germany's 1-0 win at Wembley last October. </p> <p> Yet comfort was hardly a word which sprang readily to mind for much of the match as England consistently failed to produce the pace, accuracy and above all the imagination to break down a resolute and disciplined Albanian defence. </p> <p> Not until the 73rd minute, by which time a check on the pre sent suicide rate among Swedes would not have gone amiss, did Paul Scholes and Michael Owen produce the element of surprise so badly lacking hitherto.</p> <p> Owen scored his 10th goal for England, and Scholes netted his 11th soon afterwards. That seemed to be game over but in stoppage-time an Albania substitute, Altin Rraklli, exploited a mistake by Rio Ferdinand to get one back and less than a minute later had a second flagged offside. </p> <p> As missiles began to rain down from the stands Emile Heskey, who had replaced Steve McManaman at half-time, set up a long-overdue landmark, namely Andy Cole's first goal for England in his 13th international.</p> <p> \"At least now no one will write that it was six years since he has scored,\" Eriksson said later. \"Now the ice is broken, and he played very well.\" </p> <p> The striker's moment, however, was immediately lost in confusion as Ashley Cole, joining in the celebrations, ended his first senior England appearance by being struck on the head by a lipstick. The Arsenal defender did not look seriously hurt but the incident gave the evening a sour, if cosmetic, ending and another complaint to Fifa, to add to that from the Under-21 game, will ensue. </p> <p> England could not have complained had they been denied the win which had appeared beyond them for much of the game. Until Owen scored, the Albanian goalkeeper Foto Strakosha had been disturbed only by a couple of David Beckham free-kicks. </p> <p> Albania, meanwhile, several times threatened to produce the sort of attacking pressure which might have produced a major upset if they had pressed home with greater conviction. </p> <p> As it was, Eriksson's team sometimes experienced difficulty in tracking down Alban Bushi, whose angled runs with the ball several times threatened to expose England at the back. In addition the frequent interchanges of position by Bushi, Igli Tare and Bledar Kola confused a defence deprived of Sol Campbell when the centre-back limped off after 28 minutes. </p> <p> For all that, Albania disturbed the equilibrium of David Seaman only once, and that was when Fatmir Vata awoke uncomfortable memories of Dietmer Hamann's winner for Germany by firing in a speculative shot from 30 yards which skidded in front of the goalkeeper. This time Seaman managed a fumbling save. </p> <p> Eriksson's team is nowhere near to fruition. The coach is trying to leave the players alone as much as possible, making changes which are really adjustments. Last night, for example, Ashley Cole was preferred to Chris Powell because the Charlton defender had at times looked out of his depth in Saturday's 2-1 win over Finland at Anfield. </p> <p> Eriksson's faith in Andy Cole was eventually repaid and the Manchester United striker again did much off the ball that was admirable. Yet his failure to cause Geri Cipi and the other defenders more problems still posed questions about his true international quality. As it is Eriksson will have to find an alternative for England's qualifier in Greece on June 6, as Cole collected his second World Cup booking and will miss the Athens game. </p> <p> England had to win last night and no messing. Sir Norman Wisdom might have provided the comic relief at half-time but nobody was ever going to augh off failure to beat Albania. For a time, nevertheless, they were too inclined to give the ball away and final passes were poor.</p> <p> Again Eriksson sacrificed McManaman, who early on had combined promisingly on the left with Ashley Cole, in order to introduce Heskey's weight and pace. Heskey spent most of the second half on the left but achieved little until he set up Andy Cole's goal. </p> <p> Owen, who had played off Andy Cole against Finland, seemed less inclined to go deep last night. Maybe he was obeying instructions; either way it made life easier for Albania's defenders, though it eventually did get England off the hook. </p> <p> A ball inside from Gary Neville, an exquisite touch by Scholes, and there was Owen haring to beat Strakosha. The next goal was equally astute, owing much to Andy Cole's surge on the left after which he smartly switched the ball back from the goalline for Scholes to thrust into the net. </p> <p> Rraklli's goal punished an error by Ferdinand and Andy Cole scored while Albania were grumbling about the one they lost through offside. England might well have come away singing Lipstick on your Collar. Certainly their make-up is still a bit messy.</p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Last night's victory over Albania means that in the space of five days Sven-Goran Eriksson has achieved maximum points from his two qualifiers to repair much of the damage caused by Germany's 1-0 win at Wembley last October. Yet comfort was hardly a word which sprang readily to mind for much of the match as England consistently failed to produce the pace, accuracy and above all the imagination to break down a resolute and disciplined Albanian defence. Not until the 73rd minute, by which time a check on the pre sent suicide rate among Swedes would not have gone amiss, did Paul Scholes and Michael Owen produce the element of surprise so badly lacking hitherto. Owen scored his 10th goal for England, and Scholes netted his 11th soon afterwards. That seemed to be game over but in stoppage-time an Albania substitute, Altin Rraklli, exploited a mistake by Rio Ferdinand to get one back and less than a minute later had a second flagged offside. As missiles began to rain down from the stands Emile Heskey, who had replaced Steve McManaman at half-time, set up a long-overdue landmark, namely Andy Cole's first goal for England in his 13th international. \"At least now no one will write that it was six years since he has scored,\" Eriksson said later. \"Now the ice is broken, and he played very well.\" The striker's moment, however, was immediately lost in confusion as Ashley Cole, joining in the celebrations, ended his first senior England appearance by being struck on the head by a lipstick. The Arsenal defender did not look seriously hurt but the incident gave the evening a sour, if cosmetic, ending and another complaint to Fifa, to add to that from the Under-21 game, will ensue. England could not have complained had they been denied the win which had appeared beyond them for much of the game. Until Owen scored, the Albanian goalkeeper Foto Strakosha had been disturbed only by a couple of David Beckham free-kicks. Albania, meanwhile, several times threatened to produce the sort of attacking pressure which might have produced a major upset if they had pressed home with greater conviction. As it was, Eriksson's team sometimes experienced difficulty in tracking down Alban Bushi, whose angled runs with the ball several times threatened to expose England at the back. In addition the frequent interchanges of position by Bushi, Igli Tare and Bledar Kola confused a defence deprived of Sol Campbell when the centre-back limped off after 28 minutes. For all that, Albania disturbed the equilibrium of David Seaman only once, and that was when Fatmir Vata awoke uncomfortable memories of Dietmer Hamann's winner for Germany by firing in a speculative shot from 30 yards which skidded in front of the goalkeeper. This time Seaman managed a fumbling save. Eriksson's team is nowhere near to fruition. The coach is trying to leave the players alone as much as possible, making changes which are really adjustments. Last night, for example, Ashley Cole was preferred to Chris Powell because the Charlton defender had at times looked out of his depth in Saturday's 2-1 win over Finland at Anfield. Eriksson's faith in Andy Cole was eventually repaid and the Manchester United striker again did much off the ball that was admirable. Yet his failure to cause Geri Cipi and the other defenders more problems still posed questions about his true international quality. As it is Eriksson will have to find an alternative for England's qualifier in Greece on June 6, as Cole collected his second World Cup booking and will miss the Athens game. England had to win last night and no messing. Sir Norman Wisdom might have provided the comic relief at half-time but nobody was ever going to augh off failure to beat Albania. For a time, nevertheless, they were too inclined to give the ball away and final passes were poor. Again Eriksson sacrificed McManaman, who early on had combined promisingly on the left with Ashley Cole, in order to introduce Heskey's weight and pace. Heskey spent most of the second half on the left but achieved little until he set up Andy Cole's goal. Owen, who had played off Andy Cole against Finland, seemed less inclined to go deep last night. Maybe he was obeying instructions; either way it made life easier for Albania's defenders, though it eventually did get England off the hook. A ball inside from Gary Neville, an exquisite touch by Scholes, and there was Owen haring to beat Strakosha. The next goal was equally astute, owing much to Andy Cole's surge on the left after which he smartly switched the ball back from the goalline for Scholes to thrust into the net. Rraklli's goal punished an error by Ferdinand and Andy Cole scored while Albania were grumbling about the one they lost through offside. England might well have come away singing Lipstick on your Collar. Certainly their make-up is still a bit messy. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
