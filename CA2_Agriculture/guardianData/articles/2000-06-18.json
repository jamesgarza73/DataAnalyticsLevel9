Keegan might have suspected it was his lucky day when Romania lost to Portugal in stoppage time and Gheorghe Hagi, the hub of their team, got himself suspended for tomorrow after receiving his second caution in as many games. </p> <p>The England coach must have been further convinced when David Beckham stayed on the pitch having responded to being barged off the ball by Ulf Kirsten with a petulant assault which sent the German striker flying. This time Beckham was lucky with his referee, Italy's Pierluigi Collina, who simply booked him whereas against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup Kim Milton Nielsen sent him off for less. </p> <p>By contrast Alan Shearer was the epitome of disciplined aggression. While he might nowadays have the immobility of a ship's figurehead his instincts near goal have suffered less than his all-round pace. Certainly the header, eight minutes into the second half, that was to beat Germany belonged to the Shearer of old. </p> <p>Beckham had been gratuitously fouled by Christian Ziege and put a particularly wicked spin on a free-kick which swerved and dipped past Paul Scholes and Michael Owen before bouncing past Jens Nowotny as the defender tried to intercept it. The ball reached Shearer, unattended to the left of goal, and he beat Oliver Kahn with an excellent header from an awkward angle. </p> <p>The rest depended on how well England had learned the lessons of Eindhoven. As it turned out they had not shirked their homework. With Paul Ince working tirelesly to break up German movements in midield and Martin Keown, the replacement for an unfit Tony Adams, binding the back four more tightly, the gaps so effectively exploited by the Portuguese were no longer there. </p> <p>Even then England could have paid heavily for the occasional lapse had Germany's finishing been remotely up to scratch. In the 65th minute Kirsten met Babbel's knock-down from a corner with a shot saved by Seaman with his feet. The re bound fell invitingly for Jancker who, with the goal agape, dragged the ball wide.

Or - to put it another way - one goes and they all follow suit. For a controversial or unpopular figure the effect can be upsetting but for a character of previous unblemished adulation like the the prime minister at the WI it can make you very, very sore. </p> <p>You don't want to be around when the old charm fails to work. It is like watching an audience at a Tom Jones concert start to ask for their knickers back. You will probably never be asked to give a political speech but most of us will be expected to do a business presentation at some time in our careers. Perhaps you will get an easy ride. The audience will like you and sit listening in awe. But maybe you will be heckled like Mr Blair. Or go down like a fart in a lift. Some survival tactics are useful to avoid the same moment of lip-chewing horror that our prime minister must have endured.</p> <p><strong>The victim's survival guide</strong></p> <p><br>\u0095 Know your audience. People get fretful if you appear to have brought the wrong talk to the wrong event. Or if you've tailored it to a different group. The I've started so I'll finish style of presenting is never popular once things have started to go wrong. Get your facts right before you open your mouth. What will they want to hear? What is their experience of your subject-matter? Will they find your jokes and sly digs funny or will they want to call in the lynch mob? </p> <p><br>\u0095 Be flexible. If your talk is brim-full of humour and nobody's laughing, cut out the gags and get on with the serious stuff. Monitor your audience at all times. Be aware of mood-changes or apparent disapproval. Be controversial if you like but always show an understanding or respect for their point of view as well. </p> <p><br>\u0095 Never patronise. This is a red rag to a bull with any group. Knowledge is power but assumption is suicidal. Not all grey haired people are deaf or unable to understand long words. Not all young women are secretaries. Not all men are blokes who like beer and football. Never stereotype. </p> <p><br>\u0095 If you're going to poke fun do it to yourself, rather than your audience. </p> <p>\u0095 Find out about group dynamics before you start talking. It's wrong to be too judgmental but it never hurts to be warned about the sceptics or the troublemakers. </p> <p>\u0095 Avoid hacking in to either character. Outright conflict or all-out put-down would be wrong at this stage as the group may side with them, rather than you. </p> <p><br>\u0095 Acknowledge the heckle. If you don't want to stop, at least go for the wan smile. Try a brief comic wince that may get the audience laughing and sympathising with you, rather than them. </p> <p><br>\u0095 Pray that no-one intervenes on your behalf. Possibly the worst-case scenario is when the chair cuts in to ask the audience to be polite enough to listen, as happened at the WI. This has the effect of making you look like you are not able to handle your own heckling and needs someone else to do it for you.</p> <p><strong>Tactical manoeuvres</strong> </p> <p>Alternative gambits to consider would be:</p> <p><br>\u0095 Stop talking. Step back. Stare at the floor a few moments. This relies strongly on the sympathy vote. They will think they have reduced you to tears. Few audiences are hard-faced enough to carry on heckling while you blub. Wait until they fall into stunned and guilty silence and then straighten up with a smile on your face. </p> <p><br>\u0095 Listen politely. Angus Deyton does it well on Have I Got News For You. He waits while a team member buts in, a smile of utter politeness on his face. And then he carries on with his own lines. </p> <p><br>\u0095 Return the compliment. Professional comedians go on stage armed with the most wonderful put-downs for hecklers. You could do the same, which would prevent the syndrome of only thinking of the best line once the presentation is over. An evening at a comedy club should provide enough fodder for a few presentations. Be warned, though, few hecklers can take a dose of their own medicine. You may find your hatchet job has been performed on the MD. </p> <p><br>\u0095 Go Wilde. Writers like Oscar Wilde specialised in the witty put-down. These are subtle and clever enough to sink in after a few hours, as opposed to the \"Could you ask your gorilla to be quiet, please?\" variety. Buy a book of literary insults and memorise as many as you can. </p> <p><br>\u0095 Hand over the mike. In extreme cases you can offer to let the heckler take centre stage and finish your talk for you. This will either shut them up or cause more problems when they take you up on your offer. </p> <p><br>\u0095 Ask them their name. Get into a real dialogue with them. Throw out a few questions to discover their real views. Few hecklers can talk properly. Most can only manage sarcastic comments and run out of steam when it comes to stringing complete sentences together. Inviting real conversation may shut them up for the rest of the talk.</p>",

People get fretful if you appear to have brought the wrong talk to the wrong event. Or if you've tailored it to a different group. The I've started so I'll finish style of presenting is never popular once things have started to go wrong. Get your facts right before you open your mouth. What will they want to hear? What is their experience of your subject-matter? Will they find your jokes and sly digs funny or will they want to call in the lynch mob? \u0095 Be flexible. If your talk is brim-full of humour and nobody's laughing, cut out the gags and get on with the serious stuff. Monitor your audience at all times. Be aware of mood-changes or apparent disapproval. Be controversial if you like but always show an understanding or respect for their point of view as well. \u0095 Never patronise. This is a red rag to a bull with any group. Knowledge is power but assumption is suicidal. Not all grey haired people are deaf or unable to understand long words. Not all young women are secretaries. Not all men are blokes who like beer and football. Never stereotype. \u0095 If you're going to poke fun do it to yourself, rather than your audience. \u0095 Find out about group dynamics before you start talking. It's wrong to be too judgmental but it never hurts to be warned about the sceptics or the troublemakers. \u0095 Avoid hacking in to either character. Outright conflict or all-out put-down would be wrong at this stage as the group may side with them, rather than you. \u0095 Acknowledge the heckle. If you don't want to stop, at least go for the wan smile. Try a brief comic wince that may get the audience laughing and sympathising with you, rather than them. \u0095 Pray that no-one intervenes on your behalf. Possibly the worst-case scenario is when the chair cuts in to ask the audience to be polite enough to listen, as happened at the WI. This has the effect of making you look like you are not able to handle your own heckling and needs someone else to do it for you. Tactical manoeuvres Alternative gambits to consider would be: \u0095 Stop talking. Step back. Stare at the floor a few moments. This relies strongly on the sympathy vote. They will think they have reduced you to tears. Few audiences are hard-faced enough to carry on heckling while you blub. Wait until they fall into stunned and guilty silence and then straighten up with a smile on your face. \u0095 Listen politely. Angus Deyton does it well on Have I Got News For You. He waits while a team member buts in, a smile of utter politeness on his face. And then he carries on with his own lines. \u0095 Return the compliment. Professional comedians go on stage armed with the most wonderful put-downs for hecklers. You could do the same, which would prevent the syndrome of only thinking of the best line once the presentation is over. An evening at a comedy club should provide enough fodder for a few presentations. Be warned, though, few hecklers can take a dose of their own medicine. You may find your hatchet job has been performed on the MD. \u0095 Go Wilde. Writers like Oscar Wilde specialised in the witty put-down. These are subtle and clever enough to sink in after a few hours, as opposed to the \"Could you ask your gorilla to be quiet, please?\" variety. Buy a book of literary insults and memorise as many as you can. \u0095 Hand over the mike. In extreme cases you can offer to let the heckler take centre stage and finish your talk for you. This will either shut them up or cause more problems when they take you up on your offer. \u0095 Ask them their name. Get into a real dialogue with them. Throw out a few questions to discover their real views. Few hecklers can talk properly. Most can only manage sarcastic comments and run out of steam when it comes to stringing complete sentences together. Inviting real conversation may shut them up for the rest of the talk.",

      "body": "<p>Moaning about it may be our favourite hobby, but most of us would admit that technology has improved the quality of office life beyond measure. Yes, crashing computers and email viruses are a pain, but few of us would opt to return to the days of wrestling with typewriter ribbons and carbon paper. As long as you can type and know your way round a computer, it's possible these days to leave much of the hard stuff to the software, while you get on with managing an ever-increasing workload. </p> <p>But what happens if you can't type, or have difficulty operating a standard computer? How do you cope if you have restricted use of your hands, or impaired vision or hearing? For someone with a disability, the increased reliance on computers within the workplace can cause as many problems as it solves. And understandably, this impacts on their access to jobs - out of 3.8m disabled people of working age, more than three-quarters are unemployed. </p> <p>Two national disability skills schemes are now working to help disabled people overcome problems in the workplace. Workability and AbilityNet both aim to give IT training to people with disabilities, and give them wider access to specialised equipment, to enable them to find work or further their careers. Such help is vital because even the most advanced technology is of very little use unless people are adequately trained - and that's before the issue of cost comes into play. </p> <p>Workability was established in 1998 by the Leonard Cheshire foundation, one of the UK's leading charities for disabled people. The scheme was founded to help those disabled people who lacked the educational and IT skills that would enable them to find employment, and hopes to break down exclusion of many disabled people from jobs by providing equipment, training and help in looking for work. Participants are given their own home computer loaded with software donated by Microsoft, and offered training in computer skills. Some students attend courses at colleges around the country, but for those with mobility problems, coursework can be completed by distance learning, using email and the internet to cover modules in word-processing, spreadsheets and online communication. The project even provides participants with a network of \"buddies\" to give advice on setting up computer equipment in the home as well as how to operate the PC and software. </p> <p>Amit Patel, 23, is one of the growing number of Workability's success stories. He had worked in the catering industry for some years, but felt he needed a career change, ideally to a desk-based job. Patel has cerebral palsy, and recognised that learning IT skills was essential if he was to get the office job he wanted. He enrolled on a course at Portland College, Nottingham, learning Word and Excel and internet skills. As a result he was able to apply for jobs online, as well as producing copies of his CV and covering letters. Patel's hard work paid off and he is now an administration assistant with an accountancy firm in Leicester. </p> <p>Stephen Cumming is another satisfied customer. After being unemployed for a number of years, Cumming, 29, who has spastic hemiplegia which affects the movement on one side of his body, heard about Workability. He already had some IT knowledge and a PC, but once he was accepted onto the course the scheme supplied him with a modem so that he could access the virtual college. This meant he was able to benefit from course modules on word- processing and Excel packages as well as online communication and database software. After he completed the course, he found a job as an administrative assistant with the Inland Revenue. \"Getting involved with Workability was a great boost for my confidence,\" he says. </p> <p>But it is not only those with long-term disabilities who may need extra training. Melanie Rees, had worked for nearly a decade in the catering trade when she had a serious accident at work that resulted in a 30% loss in the use of her right hand. She realised that a new career was the only option and signed up at her local college of education for a three-month office skills course covering word processing, database and spreadsheet programmes, as well as basic office skills. </p> <p>Her retraining was supported by AbilityNet, a registered charity which evolved in the 1980s out of the special needs department at computing giant IBM. AbilityNet is concerned with providing disabled people with adaptive equipment and advice to enable them to carry on with their work if they are disabled temporarily or permanently. This could mean ensuring that someone who develops RSI is provided with ergonomic equipment, or that someone who has been injured in a car accident is helped to stay at work. </p> <p>Rees found using a standard computer keyboard uncomfortable and unproductive, so she was assessed by AbilityNet and advised to use a smaller, more compact one. When it is correctly placed, she can reach all the keys with her left hand with a relatively small arm movement. There is no reason why she shouldn't become an efficient one-handed typist - a tool called \"sticky keys\", for example (automatically supplied with Windows), eliminates the need to hold down two keys at once. </p> <p>Since she has to use her left hand for everything, Rees also has to take care not to strain the muscles in her now-dominant hand. Facilities in Microsoft Office such as AutoCorrect and AutoText are a big help in correcting mistakes and entering standard paragraphs or larger pieces of text quickly. She also has a detachable armrest clamped to the table to provide extra support for her left hand and arm, and uses an ergonomically designed, left-handed mouse. In the classroom, voice-recognition software was not a feasible option, but in the future, in a quieter working environment, she hopes to explore the software's potential for entirely \"hands-free\" computing. </p> <p>Rees is enthusiastic about the support she has received from Ability- Net. \"I am really relaxed at my desk and my posture has improved as well as my efficiency. My colleagues are quite envious of my ergonomic keyboard and mouse as they are so practical and user-friendly. Without AbilityNet's advice and the solutions my consultant recommended, I would never have been able to keep up with the coursework and I would undoubtedly have suffered a lot of cramp and pain.

      "body": "<p>It's a staple part of the secretary's role that definitely doesn't appear on the job description: lying for the boss. Telling an unwanted caller that the colleague sitting right next to you isn't around to answer the phone, or reassuring a business contact that, \"of course she left on time for that crucial meeting\", we've all done it. So commonplace, in fact, is the little white workplace lie that all but the most avowedly honest of us can manage it without so much as a twinge of conscience. </p> <p>Sooner or later, though, there comes a time when the remit of the \"personal assistant\" is stretched to include covering for your employer's unscheduled - and sometimes rather too personal - activities. Forget typing speed and your degree, this role requires a talent for deceit, a headful of on-the-spot excuses and perfect timing. How else could you juggle the boss's spouse (\"in a meeting\"), senior partner (\"doctor's appointment\") and bank manager (\"er, still in a meeting\"), without making the odd slip-up? (Hint: the mother-in-law's funeral excuse will elicit sympathy from colleagues, but won't wash with the boss's wife.) </p> <p>There is an escape route for those PAs currently risking Pinocchio syndrome while the boss idles away his or her office hours on the golf course, an extended lunch break or at the dentist's (depending on who's asking), in the form of a website designed to add a professional gloss to the ancient art of lying your head off. For a fee, <a href=\"http://www.ace-alibi.com\">Ace Alibi </a> will do all that dirty work for you, providing convincing invitations to fake business conferences (\u00a320) and official-sounding phone calls to confirm that the person in question really is needed elsewhere (\u00a315). \"It's not all that unusual,\" says co-founder John Watson. \"Everybody has made an excuse for somebody else in the past. It's basically an extension of that.\" </p> <p>It's certainly a step ahead of those overused, fall-back excuses, the Very Important Meeting and the sudden debilitating medical complaint. If your boss is planning a few days out of the office on \"business\", why not enlist Ace Alibi to provide just that? A specially designated telephone number will connect the suspicious straight to a \"conference organiser\" or \"hotel receptionist\", who should convince even the most sceptical that the guilty party really is hard at work.

      "bodyText": "It's a staple part of the secretary's role that definitely doesn't appear on the job description: lying for the boss. Telling an unwanted caller that the colleague sitting right next to you isn't around to answer the phone, or reassuring a business contact that, \"of course she left on time for that crucial meeting\", we've all done it. So commonplace, in fact, is the little white workplace lie that all but the most avowedly honest of us can manage it without so much as a twinge of conscience. Sooner or later, though, there comes a time when the remit of the \"personal assistant\" is stretched to include covering for your employer's unscheduled - and sometimes rather too personal - activities. Forget typing speed and your degree, this role requires a talent for deceit, a headful of on-the-spot excuses and perfect timing. How else could you juggle the boss's spouse (\"in a meeting\"), senior partner (\"doctor's appointment\") and bank manager (\"er, still in a meeting\"), without making the odd slip-up? (Hint: the mother-in-law's funeral excuse will elicit sympathy from colleagues, but won't wash with the boss's wife.) There is an escape route for those PAs currently risking Pinocchio syndrome while the boss idles away his or her office hours on the golf course, an extended lunch break or at the dentist's (depending on who's asking), in the form of a website designed to add a professional gloss to the ancient art of lying your head off. For a fee, Ace Alibi will do all that dirty work for you, providing convincing invitations to fake business conferences (\u00a320) and official-sounding phone calls to confirm that the person in question really is needed elsewhere (\u00a315). \"It's not all that unusual,\" says co-founder John Watson. \"Everybody has made an excuse for somebody else in the past. It's basically an extension of that.\" It's certainly a step ahead of those overused, fall-back excuses, the Very Important Meeting and the sudden debilitating medical complaint. If your boss is planning a few days out of the office on \"business\", why not enlist Ace Alibi to provide just that? A specially designated telephone number will connect the suspicious straight to a \"conference organiser\" or \"hotel receptionist\", who should convince even the most sceptical that the guilty party really is hard at work. If the business trip is in Cardiff, the voice at the end of the line will be a Welsh one, 24 hours a day for as long as the act needs to be kept up. If that essential conference is in California, an invitation will arrive with a US postmark.

West Indies officials initially refused to comment on the claims, but Patrick Rousseau, the president of the West Indies Cricket Board, has launched an investigation into the charges. 'I've discussed these allegations with Brian and he's denied any involvement with anyone as implied in the report,' said Rousseau. 'Until any allegation is proven, I accept his position and support him fully.' The businessman said he contacted South Africa's United Cricket Board, 'Because I'm angry that only South African cricketers are being accused of illegal activities when I know overseas players have also been involved.' The businessman said he learned of Lara's gambling habits through Stanley Behrman, a bookmaker in Cape Town. On 3 March 1993, Behrman gave the businessman 20,000 rand in an envelope and requested that he give the money to Lara for winning bets, according to the businessman. 'I met Lara at the players' enclosure [at Newlands Stadium in Cape Town] and gave him the envelope. He was expecting the money and left after a brief chat. After the game Lara and I had dinner,' he said.",

To put it another way, had England lost or even drawn to this woebegone German team it would have been one of the most savage blows to their self-esteem in all those 34 years of hurt. </p> <p>Alan Shearer scored the all-important goal, not one of his most difficult but a strike destined to be remembered longer than many others, early in the second half. They had to survive a few subsequent scares, but England did enough to confirm they are not the worst team in their group. Indeed, England could swagger into the quarter-finals with confidence.

This showdown was about two things, history and the immediate future. The French might sneer, but they enjoy this atavistic rivalry as much as anyone. Press tickets for this boxy little ground were among the most sought after of the tournament so far, and L'Equipe and other French titles were right at the head of the queue. </p> <p>England won the sartorial contest first, taking the field in a reprise of their World Cup-winning scarlet, while the Germans appeared in a ghastly shade of mortuary attendant green. English fans easily outnumbered their German counterparts as well, jeering during their opponents' national anthem then bellowing God Save the Queen loudly enough to drown out the whistles from the other end. </p> <p>Germany began cagily, that is to say even more cagily than usual, with Lothar Matth\u00e4us positioning himself just in front of the back two defenders and trying to ensure there was always someone else picking up Michael Owen. The German veteran was beaten for pace by Alan Shearer as early as the fourth minute, but his blatant check on the England captain was only punished by a free kick. </p> <p>The Germans began shooting first, but England's aim was better. From a Gary Neville long throw, Shearer won the penalty box header, Paul Scholes chased to return the ball smartly across goal, and with Oliver Kahn stranded Christian Ziege had to clear from under his crossbar under pressure from Owen. Midway through the half Jens Jeremies engineered a shooting chance for Mehmet Scholl, but his underhit effort was easily saved by David Seaman with the unmarked Ulf Kirsten unseen at the far post. </p> <p>Owen was somewhat harshly called back for offside when Shearer had put him clear, but just at the point in the first half when German fans struck up an amusing chorus of 'You're shit, and you know you are', England made a couple of decent attempts to prove otherwise. Owen got a fine hearder on target from Phil Neville's left wing cross, but turned to see Kahn diving full length to tip the ball on to his left hand post. Then Scholes, one of England's busiest attackers, struck a volley sweetly but too high. David Beckham spoiled this encouraging patch by collecting an unnecessary booking for piling into Kirsten, although Jeremies was also cautioned seconds later for kicking Paul Ince. Honours even but England had arguably created the better first-half chances. </p> <p>Germany helped correct that impression by opening the second half with a narrow miss from a Ziege free kick, but with both teams simultaneously pushing up their back lines and keeping their forward players closely reined, play was compressed in the middle and chances from open play few. </p> <p>When the breakthrough came it was inevitably from a set-piece. Beckham's curled free kick from the right was intended for Owen, but he, Scholes, and the German defence missed it and the ball bounced once before reaching Shearer, who was never likely to miss with a free header at the far post. Germany never used to concede such soft goals, but after opening his account for the tournament the England captain was not about to complain. Neither was Keegan, who thanked the media for baiting his captain into scoring for the first time in eight games. </p> <p>Germany were forced to abandon some of their caution, and they stepped up the pace. Carsten Jancker found himself in possession with his back to goal in England's six yard box, and though he has a turning circle only slightly tighter than the team bus, he still managed a shot which flew inches over. When Scholl broke through for a shot which rolled just the wrong side of Seaman's right hand upright, Keegan had seen enough. Off came Owen for Liverpool teammate Steven Gerrard, presumably to provide the midfield stiffening England had lacked against Portugal. </p> <p>One could see Keegan's reasoning, one goal had every chance of being enough in this ambulatory affair although there is a risk of retreating too far from attack. England had a narrow escape in the 64th minute when Seaman saved from Kirsten from a corner, and Jancker drilled the rebound wastefully wide - scoring looked easier. </p> <p>Nick Barmby helped redress the balance when he replaced the tiring Scholes.

      "body": "<p>Whether the Grace Road faithful were hoping for a decent amount of cricket is a question that even they may have had difficulty answering honestly. </p> <p>They wanted the win that would would elevate Leicestershire - winners in 1999 and third last year - into second place in this year's first division. Snapping up the last five Derbyshire wickets quickly would achieve that inside, perhaps, half an hour. Is that what they really wanted? Family shopping before lunch? </p> <p>County cricket these days is continually posing such questions. At Worcester, Basingstoke, Headingley and The Oval there wasn't any play for a Saturday crowd, these games having raced to a conclusion on the third day. </p> <p>At this rate it may be necessary to give a couple of points to teams who make it into a fourth day. Here, though, such points would have been won spuriously, for yesterday was effectively day three because of the loss of the opening day. </p> <p>Here, as elsewhere, the side batting second simply wilted when faced with a target of 300-plus. Having slumped to only 133 in the first innings Derbyshire were 116 for five on the resumption. Logic suggested they might struggle to score 61 more and make Leicestershire bat again. </p> <p>Yet it needed only one decent partnership to possibly embarrass the home side in the final innings. And the pitch was good: evenly grassed and dry, offering only modest bounce and turn. Whether Steve Titchard and Matthew Cassar had the commitment and the ability to seize the stage was another question. </p> <p>Ominously, Anil Kumble threatened to tie up one end and to take most of the remaining wickets. The tall Indian may not have been operating on the sort of pitch on which he once took all 10 wickets in a Test but even on this surface his quickish leg-spin can be as effective as drip torture. So far in the two innings he had bowled 29 overs for 38 runs, and four wickets. He started meanly, but before long there was an uncharacteristic over. A no-ball was cut for three, and another ball that was too short followed that one to the boundary. Tichard looked a little uneasy, but Cassar hinted at effective defiance. </p> <p>One might expect that from a player brought up in Australia - and who played for New South Wales colts - but his batting for Derbyshire has been notable more for its sunny complexion than hard figures. Last season 24 innings produced a top score of just 42 and an average of 18. </p> <p>There was an insight into that record when Kumble flighted one generously, inviting the off-side drive. Cassar took the bait and opened his shoulders, only to change his mind and play a one-handed stroke, the ball lobbing very close to cover. </p> <p>But later there were some genuine counter-attacks: a lofted straight drive to the fence off Kumble and then, against this fine bowler, successive pick-upshots to midwicket. The first went for six, the second for four, and they were clean, authoritative strokes. </p> <p>The second of them ensured that Leicestershire would have to bat again. By this time Titchard was out, failing to keep down a ball from James Ormond that he should have had time to counter. But the real body blow came with another short ball that was bowled to Cassar, on 40, by Vince Wells. It may have been a little quicker than normal from the medium-pacer, and Cassar, cramped, could only sky it to mid-on. </p> <p>Three balls later, Dominic Cork got his front pad but not his bat in the way of an off-stump ball and was lbw - as he had been, in identical circumstances, in the first innings. After that, the resistance of Karl Krikken and Paul Aldred was hardly here nor there - albeit that it must have frustrated Kumble, who despite many appeals, had taken no more wickets when finally he was rested at 2.20. </p> <p>Requiring 47 to win, Leicestershire knocked them off without alarm. In fact, a 3.15 finish was perfect timing for the Grace Road faithful. Let no one suggest that it had all been fixed.</p>",

Snapping up the last five Derbyshire wickets quickly would achieve that inside, perhaps, half an hour. Is that what they really wanted? Family shopping before lunch? County cricket these days is continually posing such questions. At Worcester, Basingstoke, Headingley and The Oval there wasn't any play for a Saturday crowd, these games having raced to a conclusion on the third day. At this rate it may be necessary to give a couple of points to teams who make it into a fourth day. Here, though, such points would have been won spuriously, for yesterday was effectively day three because of the loss of the opening day. Here, as elsewhere, the side batting second simply wilted when faced with a target of 300-plus. Having slumped to only 133 in the first innings Derbyshire were 116 for five on the resumption. Logic suggested they might struggle to score 61 more and make Leicestershire bat again. Yet it needed only one decent partnership to possibly embarrass the home side in the final innings. And the pitch was good: evenly grassed and dry, offering only modest bounce and turn. Whether Steve Titchard and Matthew Cassar had the commitment and the ability to seize the stage was another question. Ominously, Anil Kumble threatened to tie up one end and to take most of the remaining wickets. The tall Indian may not have been operating on the sort of pitch on which he once took all 10 wickets in a Test but even on this surface his quickish leg-spin can be as effective as drip torture. So far in the two innings he had bowled 29 overs for 38 runs, and four wickets. He started meanly, but before long there was an uncharacteristic over. A no-ball was cut for three, and another ball that was too short followed that one to the boundary. Tichard looked a little uneasy, but Cassar hinted at effective defiance. One might expect that from a player brought up in Australia - and who played for New South Wales colts - but his batting for Derbyshire has been notable more for its sunny complexion than hard figures. Last season 24 innings produced a top score of just 42 and an average of 18. There was an insight into that record when Kumble flighted one generously, inviting the off-side drive. Cassar took the bait and opened his shoulders, only to change his mind and play a one-handed stroke, the ball lobbing very close to cover. But later there were some genuine counter-attacks: a lofted straight drive to the fence off Kumble and then, against this fine bowler, successive pick-upshots to midwicket. The first went for six, the second for four, and they were clean, authoritative strokes. The second of them ensured that Leicestershire would have to bat again. By this time Titchard was out, failing to keep down a ball from James Ormond that he should have had time to counter. But the real body blow came with another short ball that was bowled to Cassar, on 40, by Vince Wells. It may have been a little quicker than normal from the medium-pacer, and Cassar, cramped, could only sky it to mid-on. Three balls later, Dominic Cork got his front pad but not his bat in the way of an off-stump ball and was lbw - as he had been, in identical circumstances, in the first innings. After that, the resistance of Karl Krikken and Paul Aldred was hardly here nor there - albeit that it must have frustrated Kumble, who despite many appeals, had taken no more wickets when finally he was rested at 2.20. Requiring 47 to win, Leicestershire knocked them off without alarm. In fact, a 3.15 finish was perfect timing for the Grace Road faithful. Let no one suggest that it had all been fixed.",

With the additional blessings of warm weather, perfect pitches and real atmosphere this is what major football tournaments should be all about. Note to younger readers: before Fifa rule changes took effect in the mid-Nineties, major tournaments were not like this. </p> <p>Even more surprising is the fact that referees have been running this tournament with a minimum of red cards and officiousness. They have made the odd mistake, but they have not been spoiling the spectacle for everyone else by rigidly enforcing the latest guideline or following instructions to the letter.

      "bodyText": "Euro 2000 is shaping up to be a pleasant surprise, a wholly unexpected feast of open and entertaining football to confound all the dire predictions of chaotic organisation and hooliganism. Some of the ticketing and stewarding arrangements have been chaotic, and there is still time for trouble to erupt, but the first week has been blissfully devoid of anything to overshadow the football. For the most part teams have been favouring attack and adventure, there have been hardly any draws and only one scoreless game, and already we have seen some terrific goals. With the additional blessings of warm weather, perfect pitches and real atmosphere this is what major football tournaments should be all about. Note to younger readers: before Fifa rule changes took effect in the mid-Nineties, major tournaments were not like this. Even more surprising is the fact that referees have been running this tournament with a minimum of red cards and officiousness. They have made the odd mistake, but they have not been spoiling the spectacle for everyone else by rigidly enforcing the latest guideline or following instructions to the letter. One suspects Uefa has told them to relax and enjoy themselves, and remember that this is not a Fifa tournament. If so, congratulations are in order. If the rest of the competition lives up to its opening-week promise, we should be left with nothing but pleasant memories.

      "body": "<p>After the exhiliration, the comedown. The beautiful football played by Humberto Coelho's team against England was nowhere to be seen in this largely dull game. </p> <p>Instead the Portuguese discovered a new hero when Francisco Costinha came off the bench to score in the 95th minute and head his side into the quarter-finals of Euro 2000. </p> <p>Prior to his arrival both sides had seemed content to play for a point and the game was meandering towards a draw. However, just as Romania relaxed, Costinha saw his chance, leaping inside a crowded penalty area to nod Luis Figo's left-wing free-kick past Bogdan Stelea and guarantee Portugal's continued presence in the competition. </p> <p>As the Portuguese celebrated, the Romanian players slumped to the ground in depression. None more so than Gheorghe Hagi - who could have played his final game in a major competition. </p> <p>Hagi, who is expected to retire from international football, ruled himself out of Tuesday's game with England after picking up his second booking of Euro 2000, 16 minutes into the game for a needless foul on Joao Pinto. </p> <p>Together with the yellow card he received for dissent against Germany, five days earlier, it means his talents will be absent in Charleroi. </p> <p>Afterwards Romania coach Emerich Ienei questioned the time-keeping of referee Gilles Veissiere who failed to blow the whistle until the 96th minute, despite injury time being set at four minutes. </p> <p>Ienei said: 'Unfortunately we lost in the last second, maybe even after the last second because the referee showed four minutes but four minutes was over. </p> <p>'Perhaps it is revenge because two years ago in Portugal we won in the last second. It looked like a draw and a point is a point. I wasn't pleased with the quality of the game but a draw would have been a good result for us.' </p> <p>Portugal initially started the brighter side, dominant in midfield with Figo orchestrating affairs. But, while the Barcelona winger offered early glimpses of class, he failed to find the killer touch and the game lost its way. </p> <p>The best chance of the first half fell to Nuno Gomes who dragged his shot wide across the face of goal after Cristian Chivu was caught in possession. Manuel Rui Costa fired a more difficult chance wide from 20 yards but the Portuguese then became bogged down in a game littered with free-kicks. </p> <p>Vitor Baia then caused alarm when he dropped a towering left-wing cross before redeeming himself with a bold interception at the feet of Viorel Moldovan, moments later. The Portuguese keeper was extended again by Adrian Ilie who angled a free-kick towards the top corner in 26th minute. </p> <p>Clearly encouraged by their first-half performance, Romania started the second half brightly. Hagi teased and tricked on the wings, although admittedly with limited success. Moldovan saw a header deflected behind from Dorinel Munteanu's inswinging corner and Hagi was wildly off-target with a left-foot volley from a narrow angle. </p> <p>Perhaps sensing that the game was slipping away from his side, Coelho sent on Sa Pinto and Sergio Conceicao for Joao Pinto and Gomes. But it was the arrival of Costinha for Rui Costa, which finally made the difference.</p>",

      "bodyText": "After the exhiliration, the comedown. The beautiful football played by Humberto Coelho's team against England was nowhere to be seen in this largely dull game. Instead the Portuguese discovered a new hero when Francisco Costinha came off the bench to score in the 95th minute and head his side into the quarter-finals of Euro 2000. Prior to his arrival both sides had seemed content to play for a point and the game was meandering towards a draw. However, just as Romania relaxed, Costinha saw his chance, leaping inside a crowded penalty area to nod Luis Figo's left-wing free-kick past Bogdan Stelea and guarantee Portugal's continued presence in the competition. As the Portuguese celebrated, the Romanian players slumped to the ground in depression. None more so than Gheorghe Hagi - who could have played his final game in a major competition. Hagi, who is expected to retire from international football, ruled himself out of Tuesday's game with England after picking up his second booking of Euro 2000, 16 minutes into the game for a needless foul on Joao Pinto. Together with the yellow card he received for dissent against Germany, five days earlier, it means his talents will be absent in Charleroi. Afterwards Romania coach Emerich Ienei questioned the time-keeping of referee Gilles Veissiere who failed to blow the whistle until the 96th minute, despite injury time being set at four minutes. Ienei said: 'Unfortunately we lost in the last second, maybe even after the last second because the referee showed four minutes but four minutes was over. 'Perhaps it is revenge because two years ago in Portugal we won in the last second. It looked like a draw and a point is a point. I wasn't pleased with the quality of the game but a draw would have been a good result for us.' Portugal initially started the brighter side, dominant in midfield with Figo orchestrating affairs. But, while the Barcelona winger offered early glimpses of class, he failed to find the killer touch and the game lost its way. The best chance of the first half fell to Nuno Gomes who dragged his shot wide across the face of goal after Cristian Chivu was caught in possession. Manuel Rui Costa fired a more difficult chance wide from 20 yards but the Portuguese then became bogged down in a game littered with free-kicks. Vitor Baia then caused alarm when he dropped a towering left-wing cross before redeeming himself with a bold interception at the feet of Viorel Moldovan, moments later. The Portuguese keeper was extended again by Adrian Ilie who angled a free-kick towards the top corner in 26th minute. Clearly encouraged by their first-half performance, Romania started the second half brightly. Hagi teased and tricked on the wings, although admittedly with limited success. Moldovan saw a header deflected behind from Dorinel Munteanu's inswinging corner and Hagi was wildly off-target with a left-foot volley from a narrow angle. Perhaps sensing that the game was slipping away from his side, Coelho sent on Sa Pinto and Sergio Conceicao for Joao Pinto and Gomes. But it was the arrival of Costinha for Rui Costa, which finally made the difference.",

Myhre saves. 62 Bjornebye shoots from distance - straight at Kralj. 63 Skammelsrud goes down injured after taking an elbow in the head from Jokanovic. He leaves the field for treatment. 66 Substitution Bakke for one too many late tackles. 67 Solskjaer sprays the ball out wide to Flo but he is barged off the ball for a free-kick. The ball is launched towards Iverson in the area, but Kralj races out to punch clear and send Iverson crashing down for a short spell on his back to receive treatment. 71 Substitution Iverson ends up leaving the field to be replaced by Carew. 72 Booking Jugovic crashes into the back of Bakke. 74 Komljenovic gets kicked in the face by his own 'keeper when doing his best to foul Carew as the Norwegian tries to beat Kralj to the ball. 75 Substitution Strand on for Bakke 76 Stojkovic and Milosevis combine well to find Mijatovic running into the far side of the area. Heggem manages to poke the ball just wide of the left-hand upright as the ref blows for offside. 79 Norway win a corner. Kralj punches away for another corner. Kralj saves. 81 Booking Drulovic. Another cynical tackle. Unclear why Yugoslavia need to resort to so much play-acting and dirty tactics when they can so obviously play neat, passing football. 84 Substitution Nadj on for Stojkovic. 86 Milosevic and Mijatovic switch the ball around in the Norway area before finding Nadj, but his strike is claimed by Myhre. 87 Substitution Kezman and Mijatovic. 88 Red card After only a minute on the field, Kezman is sent off for a challenge on Mykland. Referee Dallas has clearly has enough and snapped in reaction to all that has gone before. Kezman unlucky. Substitution Govedarica on for Jokanovic 90 Carew with a late chance after Yugoslavia lose the ball in midfield. Solskjaer helps the ball for Carew to shot from close range - he puts it wide. Booking Nadj for shirt-pulling. Full-time. Yugoslavia by far the better side and should have won by a greater margin. Norway 0 - 1 Yugoslavia.",

They passed accurately, moved the ball swiftly when sensing the moment to attack and the darting movements of their midfield and front players were inventive and incisive. </p> <p>Above all, they operated as a unit, defending together, moving forward together, supporting the player with the ball, recognising their areas of responsibility when the opponents were in possession. There may have been individual ability aplenty within the framework, but the team was the thing. In short, they were all the things that, for the most part, England have not been when the drum-banging stops and the need is for something more orchestrated. </p> <p>Even against the weakest German side of this correspondent's life, last night in Charleroi there were familiar failings of both approach and execution. The hope is that a win provides more appreciation of what is undoubtedly a talented squad of players not yet being fully stretched to their capabilities. The fear is that it will mask the need for more coaching empowerment so that they can do themselves justice. </p> <p>For there is instead something haphazard to Kevin Keegan's England. For all the coach's insistence on the value of their state-of-the-art preparation, the research and the video footage, there was against Portugal an old-fashioned look to their approach, a naivety that made you wonder if the thoughtful advances made under Terry Venables at Euro 96 had been a mirage. 'Where did England go wrong?' my son asked the day after the Portugal defeat. 'How long have you got?' I replied. </p> <p>The most important aspect of the game these days is the midfield numbers racket. Venables may not have always understood figures on a balance sheet, but he did recognise immediately how many beans added up to five in the area of the pitch on which any game, every game, turns. </p> <p>When the team sheets arrived hot from the photocopying machines at the Philips Stadium and then in Charleroi, you feared the worst. There England were, with two strikers plonked upfield again, and two banks of four, one too many in defence, one too few in midfield. </p> <p>Senior players voiced reservations before the Portugal game, but Keegan was apparently his positive self; let us play our football in their half of the field, let them worry about us. It doesn't just happen like that, however. It happens with strategy and the confidence to implement that strategy, as Venables distilled and instilled at a 90-minute team meeting the day before that memorable June night four years ago when each player left convinced they would beat Holland. It was a bizarre experience looking down and watching the Eindhoven eye-opener unfold. Even at 1-0, even at 2-0 up, England were being outmanoeuvred, constantly vulnerable to the interchanging of Luis Figo, Rui Costa and Joao Pinto. In hindsight, Keegan said, they perhaps should have sat back for 15 more minutes rather than going for the kill. But how to achieve that without the right deployment of resources? And that comes from the coach. </p> <p>The reservations became more voluble and frantic at half-time with the score now 2-2, notably from an over-worked and over-maligned Paul Ince as the holding player. But still Keegan felt that same again could win the game, though the evidence, based on two moments of David Beckham at his best against the run of play that didn't even lull the Portuguese into a false sense of insecurity, was flimsy. Only when the horse had bolted - Portugal leading 3-2, and Steve McManaman off injured - was Phil Neville pushed forward on the left to allow Dennis Wise to move infield to Ince's aid. </p> <p>Last night against Germany at least we saw English finishing the game with a balance in the team more suited to the demands of the game. We saw, too, Ince restoring his reputation with a tigerish display inspirational to those around him. It has to be said,however, that neither he nor the team were confronted by the sort of movement that the better sides in this tournament possess. </p> <p>Some wise critics have suggested that players should take responsibility for turning the tide as games unfold, should recognise the problems and regroup accordingly. It is a valid point but it does become difficult when Keegan's persona on the field, Alan Shearer, is ploughing his own unproductive furrow and the lack of mobility and flexibility filters from the front back through the team.</p> <p>England were criticised for defending too deeply against Portugal, but it became inevitable with little pressure on the ball in midfield as the back four, apprehensive, retreated in an attempt to cut off the through ball. Keegan also reverted to his square-pegs-in-round-holes mentality. Tony Adams has not played in a back four in a competitive England match since Holland at Euro '96. Neither has he played on the right side of a four since the early days of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger at Arsenal. </p> <p>Consequently England, as of yore, became stretched out again, Michael Owen left isolated and provided with pressure-easing high and long balls.The best that can be said is that it all gave England much to work on for last night's game. That and the fact that they did contribute to a memorable, marvellous game. It would be more refreshing to report that the plucky, defeated opposition played their part, however.</p> <p>It is always dangerous to draw conclusions before the baggage of the first two games has been unpacked in the third, but the least England should do is take heed of the examples of the French and Portuguese. </p> <p>At given times, had the game been stopped, both were probably more of a 4-5-1 shape and it is that which does offer huge possibilities, both offensively and defensively. England were not 4-4-2 four years ago; Teddy Sheringham dropped off Shearer to help out, then find space to invent play. </p> <p>The French, for example, often use Thierry Henry's pace - a pointer for Owen - from deep and wide, getting him the ball in space so that he can cut inside and attack a backpedalling defence. They are alert, too, to new ideas of the game. </p> <p>It was Fabien Barthez who first utilised the six-second, unlimited-steps rule for goalkeepers by scuttling to the speedily for a counterattack. </p> <p>Then the Portuguese rotation. Before Monday's game, the billing was for Figo v Beckham, the best right-wingers in the world. So where exactly was Figo when he unleashed that breathtaking 25-yarder? Variation, to pull defences out of shape, is vital. Beckham needs the licence to roam and back-up from covering players. </p> <p>In addition, France and Portugal have developed their players through a progressive youth system. The nucleus of the French have come through the Clairefontaine centre of excellence, overseen by Gerard Houllier. Many of the Portuguese were members of their world under-20 cham pionship-winning team. </p> <p>Belatedly, England sought to catch up by appointing Howard Wilkinson as technical director, but as soon as they get a successful under-21 team, what happens? </p> <p>In a political coup, Wilkinson ousts the manager Peter Taylor. The English may have been without several important players at the recent European Championship, but at times it was almost embarrassing to watch the team chasing the swift shadows of the Slovakians. </p> <p>What else has the tournament shown thus far? The value of teamwork to get the most out of the gifted individual, certainly. Zinedine Zidane is the very model of the modern midfield player, strong but with touch and vision. Rui Costa reveals that artistry, and dribbling, need not die amid the team ethic. </p> <p>The Dutch initially strugggled to knit their individuals to that pattern but are improving, the unlucky Czechs had a touch of Portugal about them. The heartwarming Slovenians and even the Belgians, working touchingly to cover each other's shortcomings, have had an all-together-now purpose to them, too. </p> <p>Best examples of that hitherto, though, have been Italy, with the loss through injury of their goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and lead striker Christian Vieri serving to galvanise them into collective responsibility. A limited group, also involving the dull, functional Swedes and the disappointing Turks, has helped. </p> <p>For those reasons, the Italians currently appear an exception to a trend. The most disappointing of the 'bigger' teams have so far been Spain, England and Germany, who also embrace the most significant, best-supported, leagues in Europe. Clubs dominate thinking and television. We get our kicks on Channels 1 to 66. </p> <p>And therein lies a worry. When the TV money-fuelled, overseas player-dominated Premiership kicks off again in two months - and covers up amid the gloating over last night's win over a waning football superpower - the danger is that the more signifcant message of Monday in Eindhoven, will be viewed as just a forgettable damp squib... rather than the rocket up the English game's arsenal that it should have been.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Asx the money kept rolling in to football's coffers last week from the television companies, analysis emerged showing that fewer and fewer of us are bothering to turn on our sets to watch. </p> <p>The discrepancy increased concern among TV executives that ignoring the diverging figures for much longer could lead to difficulties. 'There's a worry in the industry that we're all being taken for a ride,' one such executive told me soon after the Premier League announced that the sale of their packages had raised \u00a31.645 billion for three years. 'Ultimately, the punter will say, \"Well I'm sorry this is too stupid. I'm not paying this kind of money any more. It's bullshit\".' </p> <p>The figures produced by TV Sports Markets show that Sky's Premiership coverage is not as popular as it once was, with the average audience for the 60 matches screened last season dropping by more than 14 per cent to 1.013 million. And yet Sky agreed last week to shell out \u00a31.11 billion for 198 matches over three seasons starting next summer. This values each match at \u00a35.6 million, double the \u00a32.8 million they are paying at present. </p> <p>'Don't think that Sky, having paid all that money, are somehow going to absorb it, because they aren't,' the executive said.

      "bodyText": "Asx the money kept rolling in to football's coffers last week from the television companies, analysis emerged showing that fewer and fewer of us are bothering to turn on our sets to watch. The discrepancy increased concern among TV executives that ignoring the diverging figures for much longer could lead to difficulties. 'There's a worry in the industry that we're all being taken for a ride,' one such executive told me soon after the Premier League announced that the sale of their packages had raised \u00a31.645 billion for three years. 'Ultimately, the punter will say, \"Well I'm sorry this is too stupid. I'm not paying this kind of money any more. It's bullshit\".' The figures produced by TV Sports Markets show that Sky's Premiership coverage is not as popular as it once was, with the average audience for the 60 matches screened last season dropping by more than 14 per cent to 1.013 million. And yet Sky agreed last week to shell out \u00a31.11 billion for 198 matches over three seasons starting next summer. This values each match at \u00a35.6 million, double the \u00a32.8 million they are paying at present. 'Don't think that Sky, having paid all that money, are somehow going to absorb it, because they aren't,' the executive said. 'It'll get passed on and Sky have got to be very careful how much they pass on so that they limit the damage when people start pulling out. There's a straight-line equation in the business that suggests that if you put the price up to a certain level then you'll lose more people than the churn [customers not renewing subscriptions] that you'd get from not having the product in the first place.' At the moment, Sky packages that include their sports channels have been held under \u00a330 a month, but this barrier seems certain to be breached.

And people say it's a life of glamour...</p>",

      "body": "<p>So you want to be a travel guidebook writer? Most people do. 'You lucky so-and-so,' I've been told countless times. 'Fancy being paid to be on holiday. What a great job.' </p> <p>Think of the benefits, these travellers tell me. Eating in fancy restaurants. Bedding down in the top hotels. Spending arduous ('ha-ha') days researching the best beaches for sunbathing and swimming. Being treated like royalty because everybody wants a favourable mention in my guidebook. </p> <p>That's the theory. The reality is there are plenty of hassles too. </p> <p>Far from being treated like royalty, guidebook writers are an anonymous bunch. Most of us don't declare who we are when we check out places: we want to find out what sort of a deal an ordinary traveller would be offered. In hotels, we invent an excuse to see a selection of rooms. 'I'll be returning in a few weeks with my parents, uncle, long-lost half-cousin and their disabled cat.' That sort of thing. </p> <p>If we do have to reveal ourselves, the red carpet is rarely rolled out. In Europe proprietors are often suspicious. 'What sort of book? I don't want to pay to be in a book,' they say aggressively. Even when they learn they don't have to pay - in fact, they can't pay - their attitude doesn't soften. </p> <p>In Germany once, a hotel receptionist refused to let me view any of his empty rooms. 'Show your editor that picture instead,' he said dismissively, throwing me a brochure. In Switzerland, a proprietor was too lazy to tell me the full range of room prices. 'Fine,' I shot back, 'in that case I'm taking you out of the book.' My reward was to be chased down the stairs and out on to the street by a furious, swearing hotel owner. </p> <p>In Asia, where Lonely Planet is recognised as the market leader, people do tend to fawn over you a little more, provided they manage to discover who you are. (Somehow, in India, everyone seemed to know I was writing for Lonely Planet, despite my denials.) But the odd free beer is usually as far as it gets. Accepting freebies is frowned upon, as we must be scrupulously objective in our write-ups. Accepting payments or discounts in return for positive coverage would mean the immediate termination of any research contract with Lonely Planet. </p> <p>Guidebook writers have only moderate status within a large publisher. We can rarely keep copyright of our own words. It's the publisher's name that sells the books - the author's name is often relegated to an inside page, or perhaps even omitted altogether (not so in Lonely Planet books: we even get a blurb and a photograph). Rumours circulate that publishers consider authors a necessary evil - specifically 'Lower than a snake's arse,' according to some choice recent gossip. </p> <p>In the early days of guidebook publishing there was more opportunity for diversity and creativity, especially with a cutting-edge publisher. Nowadays, the market is much bigger and more competitive. Travel books are a standardised 'product'. Each book within an imprint must have the same look, approach and useability. Authors have to adhere to a rigid 'house style'. It's the McDonaldisation of travel destinations. As a writer you can't help but feel disenfranchised. </p> <p>This has increased the status of editors. They will ruthlessly police our words, dispensing swift justice to anything that fails to conform. Imperious decrees will be issued, containing copious demands for clarifications or background information. Authors must respond to these swiftly, no matter what other commitments they have. Once I arrived in the Solomon Islands, but had to wrench my mind back to Switzerland to deal with a thick wedge of editorial queries and proofs. </p> <p>Don't count on making your fortune writing guidebooks. Newcomers want to do this job so much that they will do it for virtually nothing, at least at the beginning. </p> <p>They will endure countless hardships to eke out their meagre budget and track down the information they need. They'll visit plush hotels, test the sweetest-sprung divans, then end up sleeping on hardboard bunks in cardboard shacks. They'll study poetic menus in gourmet restaurants, linger longingly to ask a few patrons how they enjoyed their multi-course feasts, then dine in the meanest roadside slop-shops. They'll check prices for first-class rail and club-class jets, then breathe deep on the clouds of smoke seeping from broken exhausts in battered buses. They'll do it because they enjoy it. Rather, they'll enjoy the first three days of their three-month trip, because it's new and fresh. After that it becomes a grind. We've all been through this rite of passage. </p> <p>These new writers have quickly found that the so-called glamour has disappeared. They'll console themselves with the thought that once they've got this first book under their belt, they will have their foot in the door. Then they can start making some real money for their next book. </p> <p>What they soon realise, as they're attempting to negotiate their new project, is that the next batch of wannabe writers is clamouring to write that same book for next to no money, their own 'isn't this cool' rose-tinted glasses as yet unshattered. Thus the one-contract veteran will have to settle for slimmer fees. Another bugbear is the deadlines which are as tight as an ageing swinger's belt. The reason for this is that publishers need to get books on the shelves before they are out of date. I would love to spend four months researching three chapters of India, even at the cost of earning less money per day. One day chilling out on the beach, the next day researching, and so on. </p> <p>No chance. If it can be researched in two months, I will be given two months minus one week. I will have to work almost every waking hour, seven days a week: researching throughout the day, writing up or organising my notes at night. Travel becomes a joyless logistical exercise, conducted at a relentless pace. I will have to steam into town, check out everything in the guide and line up a few new entries. As soon as this is done I must ship out to the next place, casting wistful glances at the relaxed, time-rich travellers pondering where to have a leisurely beer. I will have nightmares about having my research notes being stolen. My dreams will be invaded by endless investigations of imaginary hotels, restaurants and train stations. </p> <p>I will return home exhausted, with a backpack bulging with brochures, timetables and price schedules. I will have to forget I have friends I haven't seen for ages. Instead I will retreat to my office until the writing-up is complete. During that time I will fail to recognise the concept of a weekend or office hours. As the deadline approaches my stress levels mount. Every hour I am awake and not working, I will be trying to suppress the nagging thought: 'I could be working right now.' </p> <p>At last the job will be finished - if I'm lucky, within deadline. I can afford a cou ple of days off now (unpaid, of course), before I start worrying about where my next contract is coming from. Before long I'm back on the road again, wrenching apart the strands that hold my life together in England. </p> <p>Which heralds the next problem for the career guidebook writer. Taking two- or three-month research trips abroad is great in your carefree early twenties. As you get older and collect more commitments, this gets harder to organise. I am married now and our first child, a daughter, was born last month. Sadly, I know that important stages in her development will happen while I am somewhere else. The career of a guidebook writer tends to be a short one. Within Lonely Planet it is said that writers usually suffer 'burn-out' within five years. </p> <p>All of this begs the question: if this dream job is so terrible, why am I still doing it? </p> <p>Because, naturally, it does have its good points too. It's nice that people think I've got a cool job, even if I don't always think it's so cool myself. The research can be exhausting, but there's a genuine satisfaction in finding a place that stands out, and then describing it accurately and evocatively.

      "bodyText": "So you want to be a travel guidebook writer? Most people do. 'You lucky so-and-so,' I've been told countless times. 'Fancy being paid to be on holiday. What a great job.' Think of the benefits, these travellers tell me. Eating in fancy restaurants. Bedding down in the top hotels. Spending arduous ('ha-ha') days researching the best beaches for sunbathing and swimming. Being treated like royalty because everybody wants a favourable mention in my guidebook. That's the theory. The reality is there are plenty of hassles too. Far from being treated like royalty, guidebook writers are an anonymous bunch. Most of us don't declare who we are when we check out places: we want to find out what sort of a deal an ordinary traveller would be offered. In hotels, we invent an excuse to see a selection of rooms. 'I'll be returning in a few weeks with my parents, uncle, long-lost half-cousin and their disabled cat.' That sort of thing. If we do have to reveal ourselves, the red carpet is rarely rolled out. In Europe proprietors are often suspicious. 'What sort of book? I don't want to pay to be in a book,' they say aggressively. Even when they learn they don't have to pay - in fact, they can't pay - their attitude doesn't soften. In Germany once, a hotel receptionist refused to let me view any of his empty rooms. 'Show your editor that picture instead,' he said dismissively, throwing me a brochure. In Switzerland, a proprietor was too lazy to tell me the full range of room prices. 'Fine,' I shot back, 'in that case I'm taking you out of the book.' My reward was to be chased down the stairs and out on to the street by a furious, swearing hotel owner. In Asia, where Lonely Planet is recognised as the market leader, people do tend to fawn over you a little more, provided they manage to discover who you are. (Somehow, in India, everyone seemed to know I was writing for Lonely Planet, despite my denials.) But the odd free beer is usually as far as it gets. Accepting freebies is frowned upon, as we must be scrupulously objective in our write-ups. Accepting payments or discounts in return for positive coverage would mean the immediate termination of any research contract with Lonely Planet. Guidebook writers have only moderate status within a large publisher. We can rarely keep copyright of our own words. It's the publisher's name that sells the books - the author's name is often relegated to an inside page, or perhaps even omitted altogether (not so in Lonely Planet books: we even get a blurb and a photograph). Rumours circulate that publishers consider authors a necessary evil - specifically 'Lower than a snake's arse,' according to some choice recent gossip. In the early days of guidebook publishing there was more opportunity for diversity and creativity, especially with a cutting-edge publisher. Nowadays, the market is much bigger and more competitive. Travel books are a standardised 'product'. Each book within an imprint must have the same look, approach and useability. Authors have to adhere to a rigid 'house style'. It's the McDonaldisation of travel destinations. As a writer you can't help but feel disenfranchised. This has increased the status of editors. They will ruthlessly police our words, dispensing swift justice to anything that fails to conform. Imperious decrees will be issued, containing copious demands for clarifications or background information. Authors must respond to these swiftly, no matter what other commitments they have. Once I arrived in the Solomon Islands, but had to wrench my mind back to Switzerland to deal with a thick wedge of editorial queries and proofs. Don't count on making your fortune writing guidebooks. Newcomers want to do this job so much that they will do it for virtually nothing, at least at the beginning. They will endure countless hardships to eke out their meagre budget and track down the information they need. They'll visit plush hotels, test the sweetest-sprung divans, then end up sleeping on hardboard bunks in cardboard shacks. They'll study poetic menus in gourmet restaurants, linger longingly to ask a few patrons how they enjoyed their multi-course feasts, then dine in the meanest roadside slop-shops. They'll check prices for first-class rail and club-class jets, then breathe deep on the clouds of smoke seeping from broken exhausts in battered buses. They'll do it because they enjoy it. Rather, they'll enjoy the first three days of their three-month trip, because it's new and fresh. After that it becomes a grind. We've all been through this rite of passage. These new writers have quickly found that the so-called glamour has disappeared. They'll console themselves with the thought that once they've got this first book under their belt, they will have their foot in the door. Then they can start making some real money for their next book. What they soon realise, as they're attempting to negotiate their new project, is that the next batch of wannabe writers is clamouring to write that same book for next to no money, their own 'isn't this cool' rose-tinted glasses as yet unshattered. Thus the one-contract veteran will have to settle for slimmer fees. Another bugbear is the deadlines which are as tight as an ageing swinger's belt. The reason for this is that publishers need to get books on the shelves before they are out of date. I would love to spend four months researching three chapters of India, even at the cost of earning less money per day. One day chilling out on the beach, the next day researching, and so on. No chance. If it can be researched in two months, I will be given two months minus one week. I will have to work almost every waking hour, seven days a week: researching throughout the day, writing up or organising my notes at night. Travel becomes a joyless logistical exercise, conducted at a relentless pace. I will have to steam into town, check out everything in the guide and line up a few new entries. As soon as this is done I must ship out to the next place, casting wistful glances at the relaxed, time-rich travellers pondering where to have a leisurely beer. I will have nightmares about having my research notes being stolen. My dreams will be invaded by endless investigations of imaginary hotels, restaurants and train stations. I will return home exhausted, with a backpack bulging with brochures, timetables and price schedules. I will have to forget I have friends I haven't seen for ages. Instead I will retreat to my office until the writing-up is complete. During that time I will fail to recognise the concept of a weekend or office hours. As the deadline approaches my stress levels mount. Every hour I am awake and not working, I will be trying to suppress the nagging thought: 'I could be working right now.' At last the job will be finished - if I'm lucky, within deadline. I can afford a cou ple of days off now (unpaid, of course), before I start worrying about where my next contract is coming from. Before long I'm back on the road again, wrenching apart the strands that hold my life together in England. Which heralds the next problem for the career guidebook writer. Taking two- or three-month research trips abroad is great in your carefree early twenties. As you get older and collect more commitments, this gets harder to organise. I am married now and our first child, a daughter, was born last month. Sadly, I know that important stages in her development will happen while I am somewhere else. The career of a guidebook writer tends to be a short one. Within Lonely Planet it is said that writers usually suffer 'burn-out' within five years. All of this begs the question: if this dream job is so terrible, why am I still doing it? Because, naturally, it does have its good points too. It's nice that people think I've got a cool job, even if I don't always think it's so cool myself. The research can be exhausting, but there's a genuine satisfaction in finding a place that stands out, and then describing it accurately and evocatively. It's good to be working out there in the real world, instead of being locked up in an office. Then there's the thrill you get when you see your guidebook in print for the first time. And I still love to travel, even if it's for the sake of work rather than for the sake of travel itself. Perhaps this last point is the key message for wannabe guidebook writers and everybody else. We're out there on the road to do a job, and we can never be deflected from that. Writers who go out there and treat it like being on holiday will end up with just that - an overlong holiday. Plus a blown deadline, withheld fees and no chance of being offered another research contract. Ever.",

As Gheorghe Hagi, their captain, said recently, it's all very well playing good football, but it would be nice to win something. </p> <p>For Hagi and others, Euro 2000 is the last chance. He is 35, his brother-in-law Gica Popescu, Dan Petrescu and Bogdan Stelea are 32, while Dorinel Munteanu reaches that age on Sunday. Over the last decade these men have become Romanian legends.

The next four games will decide whether this poor, corrupt nation of 23 million will get its first chance of communal celebrations since the execution of the Ceaucescus. For the Romanian team, it's now or never. </p> <p>At times the players seem to accept that it will be never. Once they were contenders. At the World Cup of 1994, they beat Argentina 3-2 in one of the great matches of the decade. One round later they were eliminated. At the next World Cup, they swept their group, then defeated themselves against Croatia. They were younger then, so why should they succeed now? And does it matter? Going down in football history as a footnote may be regrettable, but what matters is becoming a multi-millionaire. </p> <p>That's what Hagi seemed to decide during Romania's opening match against Germany. At first he did his best. But after he had lost the ball a few times to some overly energetic Germans, and the referee had denied Romania a penalty, he got angry, as he often does. He berated the Danish referee, Kim Milton Nielsen, and then planted his studs in the thigh of the prostrate German Christian Ziege. Gradually, however, his anger gave way to a sort of nihilist laziness. Hagi moped about, summoned the ball, and lost it again. He seemed to decide then that he had had enough. He wandered off in the general direction of a corner-flag, his head down. </p> <p>The Romanian fans noticed, and began chanting his name. Hagi heard them, straightened his back, chased back 15 yards and dispossessed a German with a model sliding tackle. A few minutes later he granted himself a regal exit to the changing rooms. Hagi seldom plays more than an hour these days. </p> <p>In Grimbergen I asked the Romanian manager, Emerich Jenei, whether he had grown fed up watching his captain spend half the game bawling out the referee. Jenei (who has called Hagi 'a fantastic man, an icon, a role model, a trailblazer, and an immense talent') said no. In fact, Hagi had been right to complain. Romania should have had a penalty. Even the German television commentators had said so. 'Previous matches at Euro 2000 have also been marked by grave errors by referees in favour of the big teams,' said Jenei. </p> <p>Surely, I said, Romania were also a big team. </p> <p>'Correction,' said Jenei.

Only Romanians understand why Gheorghe Hagi (35) is still in their team. A few brave Dutch dissidents now publicly oppose Dennis Bergkamp (31). But in France, saying a word against Didier Deschamps (31) remains a faux pas almost as grave as ordering red wine with spinach. The team hotels packed with old men nursing an array of ailments make Euro 2000 resemble Eastbourne. The reasons the veterans are still picked vary per country, but are broadly as follows: </p> <p>1. Veneration of the past. This applies particularly to England and France. Whenever Shearer is criticised, Kevin Keegan notes that he has scored goals for England in the past. That Shearer was fitter and quicker in the past is ignored. Bobby Charlton also scored goals for England in the past, but is no longer in the team. Keegan is merely the victim of an entire culture. The British disease is to explain all phenomena by reference to the past. So England's players have this week been urged to re-enact World War One, and so Michael Owen was substituted against Portugal because, in Keegan's words, 'he hasn't got the experience of most other players around that field'. In other words, Owen doesn't have enough of a past. When he does, he will presumably be picked until he is 40. The French suffer from a less virulent form of this disease. They venerate a specific moment in the past: the night of July 11, 1998, when they won the World Cup. Those who played then can choose their moment of retirement. No coach ever says, 'I'm picking old so-and-so because I venerate the past.' Rather, when the clapped-out one plays well - or in Shearer's case, when he scores three against a depleted Luxembourg - he is said to have 'silenced his critics'. This is statistically unsound. The old player is given many chances to fail, so he is bound to succeed once in a while. Moreover, he can play where he likes - Shearer as the front striker, Bergkamp and Hagi in free roles, Matth\u00e4us as a libero with neither defensive nor attacking responsibilities - no wonder he occasionally comes to life. </p> <p>2. Attribution of magical qualities to one individual. This applies above all to Romania. When I asked their coach, Emerich Jenei, whether the 35-year-old Hagi was not rather slow these days, Jenei said: 'But psychologically he is very important. It is true that he is not as fast as he was, and that he does not participate in all phases of the game, but every ball he touches is right.' In Romania, when people glimpse a black Mercedes on the highway, they wander around for days saying, 'I've seen Hagi!', Super-humans are hard to drop. Magical qualities are attributed to every England captain. The job is invested by the tabloids with a quasi-military mystique. Keegan always describes Shearer as 'leading the line', as if he were taking a regiment over the top. The effect is to make Shearer - and in the sainted past, captains like Bryan Robson and Terry Butcher - appear somehow more English than other players. To drop the skipper would be unpatriotic. To ask him to play in Owen's service would be a transgression against hierarchy: privates don't lead the line. Deschamps, the French captain, was the nominated leader at a glorious moment of French history. Like General de Gaulle, he is therefore recalled beyond his useful life. </p> <p>3. Fear. Coaches are conservative. They know old players better than new ones. So Roy Makaay, highest scorer of the Spanish champions La Coruna, may be a more effective striker for Holland than Bergkamp, but since no one knows for sure he is never given a chance to prove it. Also, coaches are afraid of dropping old players, because the old player might take revenge. A veteran footballer can destroy the coach (often a comparative newcomer) in the media. Ruud Gullit was sacked days after dropping Shearer at Newcastle. The previous Romanian coach is the previous coach because he confronted Hagi. The main beneficiary of fear at Euro 2000 is Lothar Matth\u00e4us. So close is he to various journalists at Bild newspaper and Kicker magazine that he virtually writes their articles. Erich Ribbeck, the German coach, is already much derided. If he drops Matth\u00e4us, and Matth\u00e4us leaks to the press, Ribbeck will suffer. </p> <p>4. Respect. These were great players once. Two years ago, at the last World Cup, Bergkamp scored a goal for Holland against Argentina that everyone who saw it remembers. As it happens, it was the last time he scored for Holland, but Frank Rijkaard, the Dutch coach, will always respect him. Bergkamp, Hagi and Shearer have said they will retire from international football after Euro 2000. Matth\u00e4us has actually promised to do so. But as with judges and NHS consultants, it is time to stipulate a retirement age. When a footballer turns 32, a commission of experts should rule whether he is allowed to keep playing for his country. If he is, he should have to pledge to keep quiet if dropped, played in a subordinate role, or used as a substitute, as Dragan Stojkovic (35) is for Yugoslavia. This method might sound crazy but would improve several teams at Euro 2000.</p>",

Erich Ribbeck, the German coach, is already much derided. If he drops Matth\u00e4us, and Matth\u00e4us leaks to the press, Ribbeck will suffer. 4. Respect. These were great players once. Two years ago, at the last World Cup, Bergkamp scored a goal for Holland against Argentina that everyone who saw it remembers. As it happens, it was the last time he scored for Holland, but Frank Rijkaard, the Dutch coach, will always respect him. Bergkamp, Hagi and Shearer have said they will retire from international football after Euro 2000. Matth\u00e4us has actually promised to do so. But as with judges and NHS consultants, it is time to stipulate a retirement age. When a footballer turns 32, a commission of experts should rule whether he is allowed to keep playing for his country. If he is, he should have to pledge to keep quiet if dropped, played in a subordinate role, or used as a substitute, as Dragan Stojkovic (35) is for Yugoslavia. This method might sound crazy but would improve several teams at Euro 2000.",

      "body": "<p>The vision was a long time coming. Years ago two long- limbed soul mates from the coarse Paris suburbs used to fantasise about leading their country's attack side by side. Last Friday night, with kick- off fast approaching in Brugge's Jan Breydel Stadium, Thierry Henry had a few bons mots in the ear of Nicolas Anelka. Here we go. </p> <p>France's coach Roger Lemerre, who usually favours a lone striker, can no longer resist playing both his young livewires at the same time. With double the velocity and verve than your ordinary attack, in theory it is unstoppable. For half an hour, while they spun and sprinted and dragged their Czech markers to distraction, it was spellbinding. Zinedine Zidane, who Lemerre reckons is the best player on the planet right now, is rejuvenated by them. Whenever he glances forward he sees options, colours in which the artist can dip his brush. </p> <p>Goal threats are just a kick away: spring the trap and they are uncatchable. Virtually every time France attack a goal looks on the cards. Frank Leboeuf captured the mood by saying he can 'feel the fear' in the opposition when France's cheetahs are on the run. But the scariest thing of all is that they can only improve. Afterwards Henry berated himself for squandering the chances to kill the game, while Anelka admitted he is still tuning up his game after a season largely spent stalling in Spain. </p> <p>'I felt a lack of competition,' he explained. 'I get a lot of the ball and I'm not used to it! I've played 10 or 11 games all season at Real Madrid with players who didn't want to pass to me and suddenly I'm playing every three days with people who want to give me the ball. I feel the change of rhythm.' No pleasing some people, you might think. But if you see the expression as well as hear the words you realise this is not just another selfish complaint from the boy the English like to portray as a brat. He was chatty, relaxed, content as he spoke. There was no hint of bitterness or blame. It was just his opinion on his game, and he intends to make things right. He wasn't particularly bothered by the fact Henry had scored and he hadn't. Other days will be his and not Henry's. They are both comfortable with that. </p> <p>Anelka has more serenity now. His experiences this year have mellowed him. He maintains a deliberately idiosyncratic image - take his appearance at a rare press conference with one trouser leg turned up to above the knee for no apparent reason other than to make the point he is non-conformist and proud of it - and he still believes his ability is peerless. But he now recognises the benefits of being a piece of the complete jigsaw. He has taken his place in the French 22 with relish. He has settled in and knuckled down. </p> <p>'He's very enthusiastic,' observes Leboeuf. 'I think he was desperate to be in the squad because he really wanted to show to the world that he is a great player. Personally I really think he is. His integration is going well, he's really part of the team. He's not the guy who sits around on his own like everybody thinks. He shares with us many times. Of course he has affinities with the younger players like Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet, but he spends time with us and he's very nice. They have formed a little group but last night I was with Nicolas, Thierry and Sylvain Wiltord for a while talking. It's good.' </p> <p>A couple of months ago it was likely he wouldn't make the squad at all. Dogged by injury and damned by a costly rift with his club, Anelka's career had been shunted into another self-inflicted siding. He was on the verge of a cut price \u00a313 million move from Madrid back to his boyhood club Paris Saint-Germain. He played the day before it was due to be completed. He scored. The deal was off. </p> <p>On such moments careers change course. He went on to score majestically for Real against Bayern Munich in the Champions League semi-finals, another quantum leap. He was back on the rails and recovering his fitness. Back in Paris Roger Lemerre thanked his lucky stars and looked forward to welcoming the prodigal son, maybe a little humbler and more mature than before, to the national team. </p> <p>Anelka was due to be the hub of France's attacking hopes until this season saw him eclipsed by his pal Henry. Since the World Cup the Arsenal man had been demoted to the under-21s but his revelationary form at Highbury was too hot to be ignored. </p> <p>Once he was back in the full squad the elder statesmen noted he needed some coaxing to ignite the blue touchpaper. Youri Djorkaeff had a word with the young striker, telling him, 'You have to have more belief in yourself because you can fly.' He reckons Henry's possibilities have no boundaries once he realises he is France's number one striker. </p> <p>It's an interesting concept, France's number one striker, considering both Anelka and Trezeguet are also entitled to chase the same crown. There is an intriguing dynamic between them. Three years ago a three pronged attack of Henry on the left, Trezeguet in the middle and Anelka on the right won the under-21 title for France. They have grown up together, a bond cemented by friendship. </p> <p>Trezeguet is now down the pecking order and recently he threw a wobbly in training. He's a bit unlucky, but the acceleration and penetration of Anelka and Henry wins the day. What a duo. The Arsenal striker winked and affected a romantic lilt: 'Playing together again was like a dream come true.' </p> <p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who nurtured both, believes they are the best pair in the world. 'They are not quick they are super quick. And as well as having speed and pace they are very powerful boys. And don't forget they are good football players as well. If you think of the development to come it is frightening. They can improve another 30 per cent. I would love to work with that pair.' He almost did. </p> <p>Although Henry is receiving the early plaudits (it's Henry 2 Anelka 0 so far), the Arsenal manager believes Anelka will grow into the tournament. 'This championship could come at the right time for him. He has played maybe 15 games this season where Raul has played 70. That's a massive difference. And France's attackers are all young. The oldest, Wiltord, is 26. The next oldest is 22. That is unique. We won the World Cup but had no real offensive potential. We still have the same stability but much more explosiveness up front. It makes France the most dangerous team.'</p>",

      "byline": "Sarah Turner",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>An afternoon at a children's museum can be salvation for anyone travelling with young people; a corner of a foreign country where there are other children to play with, where noise and mess can be made - a reward for hours spent patiently accompanying parents on a city-break circuit of proper museums (yawn) and sights (unspeakable). </p> <p>In general, children's museums are a city thing - Britain's main one is Eureka! in Halifax, West Yorkshire, which opened in 1992. The nearest London gets to one is Launch Pad at the Science Museum - a bustling area of scientific interactivity (the grain store and turntable are particularly popular) that will move, and grow in size, to the Wellcome wing when it opens next month. </p> <p>At Eureka!, there are hundreds of children racing around, pretending to be mechanics in a garage of scaled-down cars or playing in a scaled-down television studio. There is a child-size branch of Marks &amp; Spencer, a mini-post office and a little factory - a mini-town square, in fact, with recognisable high street names. Upstairs, children can see what really happens when they flush a loo, thanks to a see-through toilet, and play in a child-sized kitchen. Nearby is a giant mouth to explore, complete with a wobbly tooth. There are buttons to push and cogs to be turned, but signs are kept to a minimum. 'We're not feeding facts, we don't want to inhibit kids, we want them to feel that this is a fun, playful place,' says Eureka!'s new director Leigh-Anne Stradeski. Unlike more conventional museums, children's museums don't have a remit that includes preserving the past. There is nothing that can't be replaced or repaired. </p> <p>So might Eureka! actually be a theme park, albeit one with a built-in Early Learning Centre-ish feel-good factor to assuage parental guilt? Stradeski rebuts the sugges tion: 'Exhibits here are much more sensory, tactile, textured and open-ended than theme parks can offer. Any activity that we design has education at its heart.' </p> <p>Nor does she see a day at Eureka! as a soft option for families: 'We don't want an adult reading at the side or just watching their child play,' - although, below us, at that very moment, a father was doing his best to read the paper while his daughter played by the roadworks in Eureka!'s town square. </p> <p>Before Eureka! opened, they asked groups of children what they would expect to find in a town centre. Most considered roadworks to be a vital part of modern urban living, although Eureka!'s designers incorporated a mini-archaeological dig into it as well to be true to the educational message. </p> <p>Children's museums originated in the US. Today, there are more than 250 of them, and every US city has one. New York and Los Angeles have two. </p> <p>The tradition in the US is still to design children's museums that encompass both arts and sciences, and typically have sections that recreate life in the past, although what constitutes the past is usually unnervingly familiar to anyone aged over 50. European museums, such as newMetropolis in Amsterdam or Experimentarium in Copenhagen, are more likely to concentrate on sci ence and the future. Actually, Eureka! feels like a more focused Dome, which isn't surprising as several of the Dome's designers cut their interactive teeth on Eureka! (and if the Body Zone's eyeball is at a loose end next year Eureka! wouldn't mind inheriting it - the staff think it is rather better than the one in their Me and My Body section.) </p> <p>Equally, there's the same sort of commercial involvement as at the Dome.

      "bodyText": "An afternoon at a children's museum can be salvation for anyone travelling with young people; a corner of a foreign country where there are other children to play with, where noise and mess can be made - a reward for hours spent patiently accompanying parents on a city-break circuit of proper museums (yawn) and sights (unspeakable). In general, children's museums are a city thing - Britain's main one is Eureka! in Halifax, West Yorkshire, which opened in 1992. The nearest London gets to one is Launch Pad at the Science Museum - a bustling area of scientific interactivity (the grain store and turntable are particularly popular) that will move, and grow in size, to the Wellcome wing when it opens next month. At Eureka!, there are hundreds of children racing around, pretending to be mechanics in a garage of scaled-down cars or playing in a scaled-down television studio. There is a child-size branch of Marks &amp; Spencer, a mini-post office and a little factory - a mini-town square, in fact, with recognisable high street names. Upstairs, children can see what really happens when they flush a loo, thanks to a see-through toilet, and play in a child-sized kitchen. Nearby is a giant mouth to explore, complete with a wobbly tooth. There are buttons to push and cogs to be turned, but signs are kept to a minimum. 'We're not feeding facts, we don't want to inhibit kids, we want them to feel that this is a fun, playful place,' says Eureka!'s new director Leigh-Anne Stradeski. Unlike more conventional museums, children's museums don't have a remit that includes preserving the past. There is nothing that can't be replaced or repaired. So might Eureka! actually be a theme park, albeit one with a built-in Early Learning Centre-ish feel-good factor to assuage parental guilt? Stradeski rebuts the sugges tion: 'Exhibits here are much more sensory, tactile, textured and open-ended than theme parks can offer. Any activity that we design has education at its heart.' Nor does she see a day at Eureka! as a soft option for families: 'We don't want an adult reading at the side or just watching their child play,' - although, below us, at that very moment, a father was doing his best to read the paper while his daughter played by the roadworks in Eureka!'s town square. Before Eureka! opened, they asked groups of children what they would expect to find in a town centre. Most considered roadworks to be a vital part of modern urban living, although Eureka!'s designers incorporated a mini-archaeological dig into it as well to be true to the educational message. Children's museums originated in the US. Today, there are more than 250 of them, and every US city has one. New York and Los Angeles have two. The tradition in the US is still to design children's museums that encompass both arts and sciences, and typically have sections that recreate life in the past, although what constitutes the past is usually unnervingly familiar to anyone aged over 50. European museums, such as newMetropolis in Amsterdam or Experimentarium in Copenhagen, are more likely to concentrate on sci ence and the future. Actually, Eureka! feels like a more focused Dome, which isn't surprising as several of the Dome's designers cut their interactive teeth on Eureka! (and if the Body Zone's eyeball is at a loose end next year Eureka! wouldn't mind inheriting it - the staff think it is rather better than the one in their Me and My Body section.) Equally, there's the same sort of commercial involvement as at the Dome. It's just as good to talk at Eureka!, as BT has sponsored the Communication Zone there too, although the message is subtler at Eureka!, since its main exhibit is a yacht, giving opportunities to practise semaphore. True to its educational core message, the early days of Eureka! featured a caf\u00e9 full of healthy eating options. The food is more playful now, with more in the way of burgers and chips. The early visitors had felt that junk food was more in keeping with a day out, but the bins with prominent information about recycling are still there.",

But it is the island's eccentricity, rather than its beauty alone, that make his words so apt. </p> <p>Ancient Leyland buses chug around Gozo, looking for all the world like Art Deco radio sets on wheels. Blue lamps hang from the walls of the police stations; the mail is deposited in red pillar boxes. </p> <p>Yet the hot wind that blows across the island, sometimes for days, comes from Libya, fewer than 200 miles to the south. The people speak a harsh mixture of Arabic and Sicilian - until they break into fluent English, often with a pronounced Australian or even estuary English accent. Artichokes grow in the tiny terraced fields, ringed by lemon and orange groves. Every way you turn, the countryside is overlooked by one of dozens of huge Catholic churches, each apparently capable of serving a medium-sized British town, let alone a tiny community on a small Mediterranean island. </p> <p>Gozo is one of the three inhabited islands that make up the Republic of Malta. Its 26,000 inhabitants live in villages strung out across the tops of the island's fertile, flat-topped hills, or in the capital Victoria, dominated by an ancient citadel and massive eighteenth-century cathedral. </p> <p>Each day during the summer tens of thousands of tourists sweep across the island, decanted from the ferries crossing the five-mile stretch of water from mainland Malta. Mostly they head for the rocky coastline, to swim in water so clear you can see shoals of fish hundreds of feet below the boats that carry sightseers round the island. Or they wander around Victoria's marketplace to pick among the collection of lacework, locally-blown glass and cheap, slightly dated sports clothes. But because Gozo has few beaches and only one true resort town - Marsalforn - at the end of the day they head back, leaving behind an island that seems to have survived the onset of mass tourism with its charm and character largely intact. </p> <p>Many of those who do stay on rent one of the rapidly growing number of converted stone farmhouses. Ours was a beautiful, cavernous old building, with enormous, gloomy downstairs rooms that once housed the farm's livestock, and a swimming pool built into a terraced field. By contrast with Malta, Gozo is highly fertile, and in the spring the hills that dominate the island are cloaked with colour, so my daughters - tough enough to brave the Easter chill - could float in the pool and look out on acres of fields and hedgerows filled with wild flowers. But even during our stay the farmers had begun to harvest the flowers, clearing the fields of anything that could be used for winter feed for their cattle. By early summer, large tracts are as baked and bare as a brick. </p> <p>So it is the coastline that attracts most visitors, and it is as magnificent as Lear suggested. Only Ramla, on the northern coast, has a beach of any size, its beautiful red sands overlooked by a massive statue of the crucifixion. Because there are few caf\u00e9s and little shade, Ramla remains relatively uncrowded - we spent one glorious, boiling Easter day with the beach, and the rolling pink dunes behind, largely to ourselves. </p> <p>Most swimmers dive off the rocks, and the island has become famous as a centre for scuba diving. Comino, the tiny, largely uninhabited island between Gozo and Malta, provides the most spectacular sport. Thousands use a flotilla of small boats from the two larger islands to travel to Comino each day, to fry on the rocks and swim in the crystalline water. Only a faint ring of engine-oil around the white rocks of the island, like scurf on a bath, suggests how damaging its popularity is becoming to the tiny island. </p> <p>Gozo is littered with the debris of the history that has swept across the Mediterranean. It is believed to be the mythical Ogygia where Calypso lured Odysseus for a seven-year break from his journey home. Gozo claims the oldest free-standing structure, the massive stones that make up the temple at Ggantija, built around 3,000BC. The cathedral in Victoria's citadel is a fitting monument to the island's quirkiness. Its builders ran out of money halfway through the project, before a dome could be placed on top. So they hired an Italian artist to paint an extraordinary trompe l'oeil , a sweet piece of fun amid the heavy gothic architecture. </p> <p>Eating in Gozo can be tricky. There are some excellent restaurants, although they are popular and advance booking requires a level of organisation we failed to meet. Otherwise, the fare is standard Mediterranean-resort-crossed-with-shopping-mall-English - freshly caught fish of an indeterminate breed, salads, pizzas, chicken nuggets etc. </p> <p>The service can be truly eccentric. One habit is to describe, lovingly and at some length, a local delicacy, and when you choose it, bring something quite different - say, fish stew instead of rabbit pie. But it doesn't seem to matter that much. Gozo is wonderful fun. It has few of the attractions that most children demand, but mine loved wandering through the open countryside picking flow ers and chasing frogs, or rummaging among the market stalls whose owners seem far more interested in conversation than commerce. It is cheap and accessible. It has none of the pretensions or gaudiness of so many Mediterranean islands, wears its history lightly, and seems to survive its annual summertime invasions with its charm unscathed. </p> <p>\u0095 Paul Frederick's visit was organised by Meon Villas (01730 230370). He flew to Malta from Gatwick on an Air Malta scheduled flight with transfer to Gozo by ferry and stayed in a 200-year-old farmhouse at Ghasri. </p> <p>Prices for a one-week Meon Villas package at Razzett Gamiena villa in Gozo in May start from \u00a3435 per person, based on four sharing (from \u00a3400 for six sharing) and include flights, airport taxes, ferry transfer to Gozo, villa with private pool, welcome pack, maid/cleaning service and car hire with unlimited mileage.</p>",

Perhaps the Liverpool striker is not quite the finished article yet, but in the present England context he is almost certainly being too harsh on himself. Very few people up and down the country are clamouring for Owen to adapt better to England's style of play. On the contrary, the commonly held view is that Owen is one of the few gems we possess and it is about time England woke up and started playing to his strengths. </p> <p>This ought really to have happened during the last World Cup, but never quite did, and two years on Owen still finds himself having to fit in around Alan Shearer and subject to the sort of indignity involved in being pulled off at half time against Portugal in favour of an Emile Heskey who looked hopelessly out of his depth. Kevin Keegan said Owen was gutted at that decision, and no wonder, though the player had enough sense to accept the decision and even begin to rationalise it. 'Obviously Alan Shearer and Emile Heskey are better than me at holding the ball up,' he said. On the evidence of the Portugal game there is scant evidence for this theory, but let that pass. It is Owen's attitude which is important, and the way he puts a disappointment behind him and looks forward to the next challenge. </p> <p>'When you are brought off early in a game like that, you are waiting for the manager to tell you why' he said. 'You ask yourself questions. I must have been through the game a thousand times trying to see what I did wrong, and at one time I thought it was because I was the last person to touch the ball before Luis Figo scored his goal. </p> <p>'But the manager just told me he wanted a different type of player up front, and I was perfectly happy with that. Holding the ball upfield is an area of my game I'm looking to improve, along with my left foot and my heading. Having said that though, a striker has got to take risks. If you are going for that half a yard advantage you are never going to get through a game without giving the ball away.' </p> <p>Owen is far too discreet to comment on the records of Shearer and Heskey when it comes to giving the ball away, too canny even to discuss whether England ought still to be knocking up balls for the big men to hold and hopefully buy some time. How England play is down to Keegan, not Owen. Keegan has decided the object of the exercise is to get crosses in for Shearer, which is fine it it works but tends to leave Owen something of a spectator. 'I don't want the ball six feet in the air all the time,' he said. </p> <p>Young enough to be patient, Owen also knows he is going to have the field to himself after this competition when Shearer retires from international football. In theory that should give Keegan a chance to re-examine his assets and formulate a new strategy based on the strengths of key players like Owen, David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Steve McManaman, but don't bank on it. Keegan is more likely to spend a couple of months persuading Shearer to change his mind, then another couple of games trying to get Heskey to take over the great man's mantle, before coming around to the seemingly obvious conclusion that Owen could lead the line alone, with either a Scholes or a Nick Barmby as a deeper-lying split striker. </p> <p>'I've been used to playing with a strike partner all my career, but I think I could play up there on my own,' Owen said when the question was put to him. 'If we had midfielders making runs from deep and joining up in attack I think that would be brilliant. I'm best at using my pace to run at people and into space, I don't see myself as a target man. If I was up there on my own with long balls being pumped up to me to fasten on to I don't think it would work. I don't fancy being on my own up front in that sense.' </p> <p>It sounds like the Portugal game all over again. Strictly speaking Owen was not on his own, but the real reason neither forward could hold the ball up was that England's midfield was rarely within shouting distance, so that passing moves broke down through lack of support. 'We never had a free midfielder running through,' he said. 'It's hard for strikers to do anything if the rest of the team is being dominated, though I still think if we played Portugal again we would beat them.' </p> <p>That's wishful thinking, if not plain self-delusion, although what Owen means is that the Portuguese were up for it in Eindhoven - 'They played really well on the night, and you could tell by their reaction at the end they were delighted at the way they had played' - and might not necessarily be able to repeat that level of performance to order. </p> <p>No matter, Eindhoven is history now, and Owen's old friends the Romanians are next. Pity he is hardly any nearer to spearheading the England attack than he was that evening two years ago in Toulouse when he came on as substitute and scored an equalising goal.

If you can stand on one leg and hold a suitcase at the same time, you could probably be a windsurfer, too. </p> <p>Like running a marathon or doing the splits, gliding about on a windsurfing board is a feasible goal for most adults. The vital ingredient, of course, is steely persistence - in windsurfing terms, that is the willingness to clamber back on to the board from the water after you have fallen off seven times in 10 minutes. </p> <p>This is a far more palatable prospect if the water you are immersed in is vaguely warm, so I took myself off to Grenada as one of seven beginners on a package holiday run by Neilson, the activity holiday specialists. Not only are the Caribbean waters idyllically blue and beautiful, but you are often glad to cool down from air temperatures in the nineties. </p> <p>To our suprise, all seven of us - four men, three women - were out on the Grand Anse Bay within 10 minutes of the start of our first lesson. Lying on our stomachs on boards, we used our arms to paddle - an exercise that shows how close the sport is to swimming. Twenty minutes later we were plugging our collapsible sails onto the boards. This is the make or break stage. Do you have the doggedness to pull yourself onto the board from the water, achieve enough balance to crouch half-upright, haul the sail up out of the water using a piece of rope and start the whole process again when a small gust of wind sends you crashing beneath the waves? </p> <p>Basically, you have to be a water baby to put up with all this. All seven of us were confident swimmers who even gained some pleasure from getting thoroughly and repeatedly soaked. You also have to accept the physical discomfort. All of us, and even our instructor Phil, suffered scrapes, bruises, abrasions or worse. Repeatedly climbing onto the board took some of the skin off our knees and shins. I was fairly typical in also getting large bruises on the hips (from banging into the board while in the water) and temporarily losing the imprint of my fingertips (from grasping onto the roughened surface of the plastic as I dragged myself upright). And you are certainly not safe even when you get to a standing position: falling off can cause its share of damage, too. The most proficient of our magnificent seven hurt his back in an awkward fall, and needed a day's rest. Another of the men cracked two ribs after landing on top of the boom, instead of falling cleanly into the sea. His decision to keep going with these injuries characterises the bravado (or foolhardiness, some would say) that most windsurfers have in large measure. </p> <p>If you are still reading and remain enthusiastic, then you could well be true windsurfing material. Although there is plenty of pain, you can learn very fast on modern equipment. Within a couple of hours, the best of our group were sailing in and out of the shoreline, picking up sprinting-pace speeds and even managing to stop, start and steer without falling off. </p> <p>By the end of the third day, the four most able and enthusiastic completed a triangular course, and received a Royal Yachting Association grade one certificate for their efforts. The RYA regulates the sport, now endorsing 250 instruc tion companies and sites as eligible to teach windsurfing in the UK and abroad. </p> <p>I was one of the three laggards who did not pit ourselves against the triangular course. That would have meant a level of concentration and commitment more associated with work than play - and I preferred to do some mountain biking as well and to explore the rest of the aptly nicknamed 'Spice Island'. Even so, I was able to skim along the surface, change course and get some exhilaration from the experience. In our beach bar, Phil, the instructor, was adamant that all seven of us could 'easily' have got the certificate if we had wished to. </p> <p>He and his colleagues have successfully taught a wide range of unlikely-sounding pupils, including two daredevil non-swimmers last summer, adults with mental health problems, pensioners (though usually with boating experience), children with learning difficulties and primary school pupils, aged six and above, who often take to the sport very rapidly (encouraged by Donald Duck sails and junior rigs). </p> <p>You certainly do not have to be built like Charles Atlas to be a good windsurfer. In fact, many of the people who seem like swans on the water are overweight, hard-drinking and noticeably inelegant on land. Smoking is not a bar: two of our four certificate-holders are puffers. </p> <p>About 250,000 people in the UK are thought to be regular windsurfers. In this rapidly developing, 20-year old sport there is a fast-growing contingent of women participants - encouraged by the fact that the boards and other equipment have become far lighter to carry than they used to be. Single men and women are a substantial part of the windsurfing holiday market. Many of the single people on our holiday, which included another 20 dinghy sailors, remarked on how enjoyable and easy the whole arrangement was for them. You very quickly bond with others when you are falling out of dinghies and off surf boards together. </p> <p>My holiday cost \u00a3645 for the three-day course, plus another four days' stay with as much (or as little) extra tuition as we wished. The fee covered the flights, accommodation in very basic chalets and breakfast. Closer to home in Greece, the equivalent holiday would have been \u00a3312 for a week, and \u00a3398 for a far more cost-effective fortnight. (These prices are at the start of the season; at peak holiday time, they rise by between 20 and 100 per cent, depending on the location.) </p> <p>There is also another advantage of windsurfing for male heterosexuals. 'The girls love it,' says Stu, another of our instructors. 'If you go with your surfing gear to Newquay, the girls follow you about.

      "body": "<p>'We call it the Leap of Faith,' said the instructor, pointing to what looked like a telegraph pole with a trapeze dangling from a wire nearby. The idea, he explained, was that the child stands atop the pole and launches into the air, grabbing the trapeze on their way. As you do. </p> <p>It occurred to me that this whole activity holiday business was something of a leap of faith. It sounded wonderful: Isle of Wight, seaside location; 'a special experience for every child', allowing them to 'develop new interests and explore new challenges'. Hmm. Challenges. Trouble is, our son is not a great one for challenges. </p> <p>'List any medical problems or special needs we should know about in relation to your child,' the form had said. How about congenital timidity, an almost clinical lack of co-ordination and a pathological fear of anything new that might be 'hard'? </p> <p>'Look, they offer dragon boating and 'aquafun' in their own pool...' Aidan, our eight-year-old, requires a major bribe to do even a width at the shallow end without putting his foot down. 'They go mountain biking...' Said son cycles a wobbly couple of laps of our street before begging to be allowed to put his bike away. Maybe the presence of a couple of friends would spur him on. No child wants to lose face in front of mates - especially if one's a girl. 'We're going to Canada next week,' Laura, my five-year-old daughter, had announced to the playground in general a few weeks earlier. 'Little Canada,' I hastened to add, as a couple of other parents looked impressed. 'It's on the Isle of Wight.' </p> <p>The company that runs Little Canada, and a similar centre at Osmington Bay in Dorset, recently changed its name from Superchoice to 3D. Why 3D? No one seemed to know - though timid son thought the admonition that no one was allowed on the trampoline without a 3D instructor meant the instructor had to be there in the flesh: a two-dimensional picture of one would not do. </p> <p>A flock of these multi-dimensional instructors made themselves available the minute we arrived and bore the kids away to view their 'common room' and bag bunks in their respective chalets, successfully dissolving any worries with their bubbly enthusiasm. </p> <p>Well, if you were eight years old, who would you rather hang out with on holiday? Parents way the wrong side of 30 who occasionally like to sit in one place and read a newspaper? Or bouncy 23-year-olds who are still on for bopping with you at the evening disco after spending all day shepherding you from rock climbing to low ropes to circus skills? </p> <p>And one of these really fun grown-ups even stays with you all night. Forget chilly dormitories and rows of washbasins: at 3D camps, under-10s sleep six to a centrally heated chalet, each with en suite facilities; there's a separate bedroom for an instructor, on hand to make sure teeth are brushed and to deal with any nightmares. </p> <p>In fact it probably wouldn't matter how luxurious the accommodation was or wasn't. By the time your day has included, perhaps, abseiling, archery, canoeing, 'aeroball' (a cross between basketball and trampolining - particularly popular with Lauren, aged eight) and an after-dinner scavenger hunt, and you've made time for pillow fights, 'midnight' feasts and a healthy dose of talking after lights-out - which unconscious child is going to notice how comfortable their bed is? </p> <p>This place has been called Little Canada ever since the Twenties, when a New Zealander called Howarth, struck by the beauty of the ancient woodland running down to a stony creek, had the idea of adding log cabins - probably one of the country's earliest holiday camps. Whether he had ever actually visited Big Canada, no one knows. By coincidence, Canadian troops were billeted in those same cabins during the Second World War and used the nearby Woodside Bay - now the scene of the children's Tuesday night campfire sessions - to practise for the D-Day landings. Today's chalets are all suitably named: our troop were sleeping in St Lawrence, and would head up past Newfoundland and Saskatchewan for dinner. And Aidan? You could almost say it was the making of him. Ten-pin bowling was 'brilliant'. Popmobility was 'embarrassing but I did it'. And 'Jacob's ladder' - an 'initiative' course (no assault courses any more) that involved getting all members of your team across an obstacle course using only a 10ft ladder - was 'hard, but cool: we found this really neat trick'. But coolest by far was The Matrix, a specially built version of TV's The Crystal Maze. Children solve puzzles to make their way through a series of four themed rooms: the office ('a prehistoric office, Mummy, from when they didn't have computers'), the Wild West Saloon, the Victorian haunted house and the spaceship. The whole lot is presided over by a 'Master' complete with floor-length purple velvet cloak. 'I can't tell you any of the answers, Mummy, because I would have to shoot you.' </p> <p>There is also tunnelling, fencing, quad-biking and orienteering. The 'croc swamp' takes a game all children play - that one where your sitting room is a lake of piranhas, and every cushion in the house is pressed into service as a stepping stone - and makes it more exciting. Small wooden platforms take the place of your sofa cushions, and the kids use a short plank to traverse trickier sections. A thin rain falling steadily from a very English sky did not dampen the collective enthusiasm. </p> <p>Really inclement weather would mar a child's summer camp experience, though indoor facilities such as a climbing wall, tunnel trail, swimming pool and IT labs would ensure the holiday was not ruined. </p> <p>Which takes us back to that leap of faith. 'High ropes' - half a dozen 40ft-high poles linked by walkways, trapezes and zip wires - is one activity that would be made unacceptably dangerous by heavy rain, even though the children are securely harnessed and helmeted before ascending. How Aidan would handle it was a matter of intense interest. The zip wire involves leaping from the top of the highest pole, travelling 70ft to a spot on a tree some way away, then bouncing back to the lowest point before abseiling to the ground. The boy had clearly taken some persuading. 'I was sitting there on the platform and Dave said to shuffle forward, so I did. And then he pushed me.' The descent takes just a couple of seconds, but it was long enough for his anguished 'aarrgh' to turn into a triumphant 'yee-hah'. </p> <p>It was only on the way home that we realised how all-consuming Little Canada had been. Like almost every male in the developed world who is over five but under five feet, the boys of our party are Pok\u00e9mon crazy. Yet it was not until Portsmouth was well behind us and we had almost hit the M25 that Zapdos, Geodude and Pikachu reared their ugly (well, they are) heads. Nature trail, quiz and dragon boat had done what everyday life could not: relegate the exploits of Ash and Team Rocket to their proper place. Children can go on full seven-night holidays to Little Canada - a useful summer holiday solution for working parents; Osmington Bay also offers four-night stays - or they can opt for individual Adventure Days if they live, or are on holiday, nearby. This may seem an attractive way of offering your kids exciting activities without bidding them goodbye for a whole week, but I suspect it would be a tame version. However absorbing the sports and games, the real fun lies in the no-mum-or-dad camaraderie of the dormitory, in - for the boys at least - sitting up late giggling about 6ft willies and making up 'poems' about diarrhoea. </p> <p>It is probably a long way from what the upstanding Mr Howarth had in mind, but given the state of my son's sponge bag after the holiday - soap and flannel in the same pristine state in which they had gone in - I must conclude that ' mens filthy in corpore even filthier ' would be a fair motto for summer camp. </p> <p>\u0095 3D Education and Adventure Ltd, Little Canada Centre, New Road, Wootton, Isle of Wight. <a href=\"http://www.3d-education.co.uk\">www.3d-education.co.uk</a>.

The zip wire involves leaping from the top of the highest pole, travelling 70ft to a spot on a tree some way away, then bouncing back to the lowest point before abseiling to the ground. The boy had clearly taken some persuading. 'I was sitting there on the platform and Dave said to shuffle forward, so I did. And then he pushed me.' The descent takes just a couple of seconds, but it was long enough for his anguished 'aarrgh' to turn into a triumphant 'yee-hah'. It was only on the way home that we realised how all-consuming Little Canada had been. Like almost every male in the developed world who is over five but under five feet, the boys of our party are Pok\u00e9mon crazy. Yet it was not until Portsmouth was well behind us and we had almost hit the M25 that Zapdos, Geodude and Pikachu reared their ugly (well, they are) heads. Nature trail, quiz and dragon boat had done what everyday life could not: relegate the exploits of Ash and Team Rocket to their proper place. Children can go on full seven-night holidays to Little Canada - a useful summer holiday solution for working parents; Osmington Bay also offers four-night stays - or they can opt for individual Adventure Days if they live, or are on holiday, nearby. This may seem an attractive way of offering your kids exciting activities without bidding them goodbye for a whole week, but I suspect it would be a tame version. However absorbing the sports and games, the real fun lies in the no-mum-or-dad camaraderie of the dormitory, in - for the boys at least - sitting up late giggling about 6ft willies and making up 'poems' about diarrhoea. It is probably a long way from what the upstanding Mr Howarth had in mind, but given the state of my son's sponge bag after the holiday - soap and flannel in the same pristine state in which they had gone in - I must conclude that ' mens filthy in corpore even filthier ' would be a fair motto for summer camp. \u0095 3D Education and Adventure Ltd, Little Canada Centre, New Road, Wootton, Isle of Wight. www.3d-education.co.uk.

Children's Discovery Museum of San Jos\u00e9 Widely considered to be the best children's museum on the US West Coast, it offers an innovative child-centred presentation of past and present, from a turn-of-the-century house and porch with household implements and furnishings of the period, to a banking system and Jesse's Clubhouse - a multi-level tower with a video effects system which allows images and perspectives to be changed. 180 Woz Way, San Jos\u00e9, California (001 408 298 5437/www.cdm.org) Open Monday to Saturday 10am-5pm, Sunday noon-5pm $6 (\u00a33.71) , children aged under one free. newMetropolis, Amsterdam From the ashes of the now-closed Technologie museum has risen a brand new children's museum. With an eye to the future, exhibits include computer games where players trade information, money and places, while the energy section juggles lifestyle and the environment. Younger children have their own area to play, dress up as scientists or doctors, then watch themselves on television afterwards. 'Hosts' are on hand to help with language difficulties.

Younger visitors get to build a house using cranes and polystyrene bricks, while older children learn about machines, the body and communication. Adults are kept in their place, allowed to observe rather than encouraged to participate with their children. More structured than most - but impressive.

Because of deference. Because their frailties and incapacities were largely hidden - certainly from the denizens of impolite society. The media monarchy began 30 years ago, when the Queen allowed the BBC to peer genteelly behind the scenes and see her and her brood as 'ordinary people'. Richard Cawston's sanitised film was the natural progenitor of William's date with photo-opportunity. From then on, the family were stars in their own endless soap.

      "body": "<p><strong>October Sky </strong><br> (1999, PG, Columbia Tristar, VHS/Rental, DVD/Retail)</p> <p>Joe Johnson's deeply moving film tells the true story (naturally a trifle touched up) of the 17-year-old Hiram Hickam (Jake Gyllendahl) who was inspired by the 1957 launch of Sputnik One, the first man-made space satellite, to experiment with rockets in his dying coal-mining town in West Virginia. It transformed his life and Hickam eventually became a Nasa engineer. Chris Cooper is excellent as Hiram's father, a colliery manager, and Laura Dern is touching as his sympathetic science teacher.</p> <p><strong>Straight Time </strong><br> (1978, 18, Warner, VHS/Retail)</p> <p>Directed by the underrated Ulu Grosbard (the man responsible that year for the Broadway triumph of David Mamet's American Buffalo) this first-rate low-life melodrama allows Dustin Hoffman to sink his ferrety teeth into the meaty role of an incorrigible crook emerging from San Quentin to continue a life of crime. Harry Dean Stanton is marvellous as a fellow thief, as is M. Emmet Walsh as a slimy parole officer. The script is based on the book No Beast So Fierce by recidivist criminal turned writer Ed Bunker, who has since provided authenticity to several crime films, including Reservoir Dogs in which he played Mr Blue.</p> <p><strong>They Were Expendable </strong><br> (1945, PG, Warner, VHS/Retail)</p> <p>The greatest by some way of the 16 movies released this week in Warner's War Collection, John Ford's lengthy, devoted, visually graceful tribute to the work of the American navy's small boat operators in the Pacific during the Second World War is set against the background of the Philippines defeat. As the commanding officer Robert Montgomery is superb, and he is supported by John Wayne and various Ford regulars.

      "bodyText": "October Sky (1999, PG, Columbia Tristar, VHS/Rental, DVD/Retail) Joe Johnson's deeply moving film tells the true story (naturally a trifle touched up) of the 17-year-old Hiram Hickam (Jake Gyllendahl) who was inspired by the 1957 launch of Sputnik One, the first man-made space satellite, to experiment with rockets in his dying coal-mining town in West Virginia. It transformed his life and Hickam eventually became a Nasa engineer. Chris Cooper is excellent as Hiram's father, a colliery manager, and Laura Dern is touching as his sympathetic science teacher. Straight Time (1978, 18, Warner, VHS/Retail) Directed by the underrated Ulu Grosbard (the man responsible that year for the Broadway triumph of David Mamet's American Buffalo) this first-rate low-life melodrama allows Dustin Hoffman to sink his ferrety teeth into the meaty role of an incorrigible crook emerging from San Quentin to continue a life of crime. Harry Dean Stanton is marvellous as a fellow thief, as is M. Emmet Walsh as a slimy parole officer. The script is based on the book No Beast So Fierce by recidivist criminal turned writer Ed Bunker, who has since provided authenticity to several crime films, including Reservoir Dogs in which he played Mr Blue. They Were Expendable (1945, PG, Warner, VHS/Retail) The greatest by some way of the 16 movies released this week in Warner's War Collection, John Ford's lengthy, devoted, visually graceful tribute to the work of the American navy's small boat operators in the Pacific during the Second World War is set against the background of the Philippines defeat. As the commanding officer Robert Montgomery is superb, and he is supported by John Wayne and various Ford regulars. Donna Reed is marvellous as a nurse. Excalibur (1981, 15, Warner, DVD/Retail) In a film that is central to the canon of John Boorman, arguably Britain's greatest living director, this re-telling of the Arthurian legend draws on Malory, Wagner and Boorman's own sense of man's tragic destiny in a visually stunning work that combines the earthy, the ethereal and the epic. Nigel Terry is a brusque Arthur who grows into kingship, Cherie Lunghi plays avulnerable Guinevere, Helen Mirren an erotically malevolent Morgana, Nicol Williamson a controversially querulous Merlin.",

      "byline": "Nicci Gerrard",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>'Life goes by so fast, doesn't it? Now there's not that much time left. I've got so much less life than I've had.' Sheila Hancock is 67, a mother, a grandmother, a steadily working woman. She lost her first husband. She has had cancer herself. 'Life's never just smooth,' she says. 'Don't ever expect it to be.' She has been an actress for more than 50 years, since she was 15 and played Beth in Little Women. She has been in Carry On films (she was, apparently, the only woman Kenneth Williams would allow to use his lavatory), in sitcoms, in Hollywood films. She had her own TV slot (Now Seriously, it's Sheila Hancock). She was in the Actor's Company at the National Theatre, a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. She electrified in Sweeney Todd, in The Duchess of Malfi, in Gorky plays. As she says herself, people don't know whether she is a straight actress or a comedian, or what. 'They're confused. They say: \"When are we going to see you back on telly?\" If you do theatre, most people think you've died anyway. But I never had a career plan; I wasn't lucky enough to be that revered. I've just always been a working actress.' Most recently, she's been wacky and relaxed on Have I Got News For You , where most women get eaten alive (the secret is to be yourself, she says). On 6 July, she makes a cameo appearance on EastEnders. And she is currently making a film, directed by Nick Renton, called The Russian Bride; she plays the mother, with a rich past and exotic hair and make-up. It takes her an hour and a half to get ready each day, and when I meet her, there are still traces of greasepaint on her creased, triangular face. </p> <p>She sits in an easy chair opposite me, kicks off her shoes, coils her slim legs, uses her long and slender hands with great animation, pointing and gesturing, and occasionally laying her fingers against her cheek in an expression of delightful astonishment. She is constantly mobile and animated. Her eyes shine under their dark brows. She has strong opinions, high passions, great affections. She likes, she says, to be 'entangled' with life; she never wants to waste it ('It's the only one we have, after all'). Her husband, the actor John Thaw (Morse, Kavanagh, grumpy, ageing sexpot) once said that she jumps into situations feet first, and only then realises there's a 20ft drop. Now, she says, she is 'trying to prepare for old age' - by which she absolutely doesn't mean trying to learn patience, serenity, invisibility, sweetness, or that slow withdrawal from turbulent life that old women especially are supposed to go through. Quite the reverse. 'Old age for women,' she says, 'is often so sad. It's such a waste. I'm a Quaker and I tell you, I meet lots of splendid old women there, in their nineties some of them. They are the sparkiest, most intelligent, most enlightened women I've ever come across. If I campaign - well, shout my mouth off, really - about older actresses being overlooked, it's because I regard it as a duty. If they're being overlooked on screen, then they're being overlooked in life too. Older women being preposterous, witty, difficult. Women with grey hair having sex! You have to look younger than your age; you're only a splendid old woman if you look 20 years younger than you are. How do you break that down? It's a battle.' </p> <p>Her own face carries its 67 years of experience: it is vital and kind and curious and sexy and wry with age. She doesn't wear make-up ('but that's partly vanity anyway, because foundation gets in the cracks'). She won't have cosmetic surgery: 'I don't want to spend my old age pretending to be younger than I am. But I don't like sagging. The pull of gravity is hard to resist. I work out. And I want my face to be tidy.' She grins. 'A neat and tidy face. It's better than it was,' she continues. 'There are fabulous women doing comedy now, too - grotesque comedy even. God, not like when I was young. The battles when I tried to be extreme, or radical, or controversial - anything that wasn't ditsy Sheila, working-class Sheila. Everyone,' she says, sitting up in her chair with her bright eyes and speaking hands, 'everyone has to trailblaze.' </p> <p>Sheila Hancock grew up in London. Her parents worked in pubs. 'My bedroom was above the bar and it was quite rough, lots of noise. I would lie there listening to this strange, mysterious clattering going on, shouting.' She was seven at the outbreak of the war, living first in King's Cross and then Bexley Heath ('Bomb Alley'). At eight she was evacuated to Berkshire. The local children 'resented us. We were quite bullied. I can hardly bear to think of it now - being put down in a strange place, away from our parents, or else living our life in London down holes really - sleeping in a shelter, having a lesson in a shelter, walking around in helmets and gas masks. I think that I am now a basically fearful person. There's a core of fear inside me. It's always there.' She spends her time with her grandchildren telling them how beautiful and bright and tremendous they are. 'So that they maybe won't be fearful like me.' She loves fearlessness and honesty and confidence - Germaine Greer is one of her idols, for her 'courage in this time of hype, of culling, of taking the middle way. A stunning woman.' Her own fearlessness - the engagement with life that John Thaw talks of, that makes her active, vociferous, candid - doesn't come naturally to her. It's a willed and plucky quality ('I've learnt my style from magazines,' she says). She's valiant. </p> <p>Hancock's childhood fears make it surprising, perhaps, that she chose to become an actress (she has always suf fered from excruciating stage fright, which she now copes with by seeing a hypnotist). 'There weren't that many choices when I was young, not for someone like me.' She loved her grammar school, where she won a scholarship, and was inspired by many of her teachers - 'but I didn't want to be a teacher, or a nurse, which seemed the only other options. Then I was in Saint Joan at school and people were nice about it and I thought I'd try.' She went to Rada, and then 'disappeared into weekly rep and obscurity for years on end. I slogged around. Nobody noticed me. When I was young, my sort of person didn't fit in. I wasn't pretty and I had a bit of an accent. I've never felt,' she says, without any trace of false modesty, 'that I looked any good. All my life I've felt plain. Sometimes I look at photos of myself when young and I think, \"Well, I don't look bad really, I've a good figure.\"' </p> <p>I ask her what on earth she dislikes about her appearance. 'My chin,' she touches it. 'My chin's too big. And my nose,' she puts a finger to her nose, 'my nose is funny. I love beautiful women,' she says. 'I'm not jealous of them at all. I remember when I was at Rada, with Diane Cilento. I went to her flat, and she took a bath. She had skin like a peach and green eyes and blonde hair. I almost wept with pleasure when I saw her, she was so lovely. I was this plain version of her, which is probably why I was so moved by her. I like beautiful men too. I would have loved to have been beautiful; to have looked in the mirror and said: \"God you look wonderful.\" Do people do that, I wonder. Love what they see in the mirror?' </p> <p>In her late thirties, her father died. 'That hit me hard. His dying changed me. I was always a girl who wanted to please her dad, and he so wanted me to succeed. 'If I came home and said \"I came second?\" he'd say \"Who was first?\" I was a grammar school kid and my parents weren't educated. I look back with enormous regret and pain at that time in my life when I grew away from them. I didn't despise them exactly, but I felt, well, grand, superior. My father died very suddenly, before we had time to say things. My mother died a year later, of cancer, and we came back to each other before she died. I nursed her and in the last few months we were very close. We don't tell our mothers we admire them enough, do we - or I didn't. She wasn't a woman who talked easily about her emotions. I remember washing her one day and saying \"God Mum, what a lovely nose you've got.\" She said, \"All my life I've hated my nose.\" [Clearly, the anxiety about noses runs in her family.] I thought, how is it I've never told her before how beautiful she is. Her lovely nose.' </p> <p>A year later, Hancock's first husband, the actor Alec Ross, also died of cancer, a long, drawn-out death. 'It was a nasty period, yes. There was a lot of suffering - for them,' she adds hastily, not for her. She coped with the grief and loss by getting involved with the hospice movement. 'You've got to allow yourself the sorrow and then you've got to be practical. I thought: \"I'll do something with these feelings.\" But this is just life,' she says - everyone's life. She's no different, except she is luckier than most people, with money, security, family, a job she loves. 'Life is not continual joy for anyone. Life is something that has to be lived and [she wrinkles up her nose] achieved. We have to earn our right to be here. Interspersed with the struggles are the glorious times. But they cannot be continuous. If you are a thinking person, they cannot be. Even when you are having a wonderful time, you must know there are others who are suffering. Life is not a bowl of cherries. It is a series of things you get over and survive - if you're lucky enough. Some people's life is made up of suffering. I worry when I come across people who expect life to be just happy, who expect to be beautiful and healthy and successful and perfect. Life is a hill you must climb. Just take a deep breath and do it.' </p> <p>Even after those three deaths, Hancock 'always had hope. There's a working-class steeliness in the middle of me, a will to survive.' In 1973 she married Thaw, and they are married still, with three daughters between them, grandchildren whom they adore, a house in France, a cottage in Wiltshire, a flat in London, but, she says, 'a rackety old domestic life really. We work terrible hours.' She insists on their 'ordinariness'. She says they are blessed. Sometimes, she says, they look at their lives and feel proud of how far they have come. 'John'll say: \"Well, a bit of a change from the council flat.\" It can feel unreal. We don't take it for granted, not at all, not for a minute.' </p> <p>Twelve years ago, Sheila Hancock had breast cancer. It did not, she says, 'ennoble' her, but it did teach her to make the most of whatever time she had left, 'although that's simply from getting older, as well. You learn to savour life. You look at a sunset and you realise how wonderful it is. You give yourself the time.' Cancer, she says, with all its attendant pain and fear, was 'nothing, absolutely nothing, I can't even think about it', compared to the emotions she went through 18 months ago when her grandson, Jack, had a brain tumour. 'We could have lost him. Anything else pales into insignificance. I lose a job, so fucking what? Cancer - huh. I couldn't do anything, boss the doctors, make arrangements - that wasn't my job, that was my daughter's job. I could only be there if I was wanted. Crying and praying and waiting. It's the closest I have ever come to not being able to cope.' She puts her hand over her mouth and stares at the memory. </p> <p>She wants to go on working. She wants to learn the piano ('but I want to be brilliant - first not second'). She wants to write a novel (she has the first three chapters but calls them 'crap'). She has just built a sandpit in her garden for her beloved grandchildren. She still has her centre of fear. She remembers once taking part in a show called Night of a Hundred Stars. She was waiting in the wings with Millicent Martin. 'I was dying with fear. I said to Millie, 'Aren't you scared?' and she said 'No, why should I be? I wouldn't be here if they didn't want me.' And she went on and was marvellous and I went on and I was ghastly. I loved her spirit. I love that kind of confidence in women. I have a friend who knows she's pretty, and wonderful. Her parents told her so all her childhood. It's a joy to be with her. She bubbles with pleasure. So in the moment. She's never whingeing or saying, \"Oh, am I all right?\" It must be so tiresome to be with me. People must get so impatient. I bet they want to shake me and shake me.' I don't think so. Hug, maybe.</p>",

She won't have cosmetic surgery: 'I don't want to spend my old age pretending to be younger than I am. But I don't like sagging. The pull of gravity is hard to resist. I work out. And I want my face to be tidy.' She grins. 'A neat and tidy face. It's better than it was,' she continues. 'There are fabulous women doing comedy now, too - grotesque comedy even. God, not like when I was young. The battles when I tried to be extreme, or radical, or controversial - anything that wasn't ditsy Sheila, working-class Sheila. Everyone,' she says, sitting up in her chair with her bright eyes and speaking hands, 'everyone has to trailblaze.' Sheila Hancock grew up in London. Her parents worked in pubs. 'My bedroom was above the bar and it was quite rough, lots of noise. I would lie there listening to this strange, mysterious clattering going on, shouting.' She was seven at the outbreak of the war, living first in King's Cross and then Bexley Heath ('Bomb Alley'). At eight she was evacuated to Berkshire. The local children 'resented us. We were quite bullied. I can hardly bear to think of it now - being put down in a strange place, away from our parents, or else living our life in London down holes really - sleeping in a shelter, having a lesson in a shelter, walking around in helmets and gas masks. I think that I am now a basically fearful person. There's a core of fear inside me. It's always there.' She spends her time with her grandchildren telling them how beautiful and bright and tremendous they are. 'So that they maybe won't be fearful like me.' She loves fearlessness and honesty and confidence - Germaine Greer is one of her idols, for her 'courage in this time of hype, of culling, of taking the middle way. A stunning woman.' Her own fearlessness - the engagement with life that John Thaw talks of, that makes her active, vociferous, candid - doesn't come naturally to her. It's a willed and plucky quality ('I've learnt my style from magazines,' she says). She's valiant. Hancock's childhood fears make it surprising, perhaps, that she chose to become an actress (she has always suf fered from excruciating stage fright, which she now copes with by seeing a hypnotist). 'There weren't that many choices when I was young, not for someone like me.' She loved her grammar school, where she won a scholarship, and was inspired by many of her teachers - 'but I didn't want to be a teacher, or a nurse, which seemed the only other options. Then I was in Saint Joan at school and people were nice about it and I thought I'd try.' She went to Rada, and then 'disappeared into weekly rep and obscurity for years on end. I slogged around. Nobody noticed me. When I was young, my sort of person didn't fit in. I wasn't pretty and I had a bit of an accent. I've never felt,' she says, without any trace of false modesty, 'that I looked any good. All my life I've felt plain. Sometimes I look at photos of myself when young and I think, \"Well, I don't look bad really, I've a good figure.\"' I ask her what on earth she dislikes about her appearance. 'My chin,' she touches it. 'My chin's too big. And my nose,' she puts a finger to her nose, 'my nose is funny. I love beautiful women,' she says. 'I'm not jealous of them at all. I remember when I was at Rada, with Diane Cilento. I went to her flat, and she took a bath. She had skin like a peach and green eyes and blonde hair. I almost wept with pleasure when I saw her, she was so lovely. I was this plain version of her, which is probably why I was so moved by her. I like beautiful men too. I would have loved to have been beautiful; to have looked in the mirror and said: \"God you look wonderful.\" Do people do that, I wonder. Love what they see in the mirror?' In her late thirties, her father died. 'That hit me hard. His dying changed me. I was always a girl who wanted to please her dad, and he so wanted me to succeed. 'If I came home and said \"I came second?\" he'd say \"Who was first?\" I was a grammar school kid and my parents weren't educated. I look back with enormous regret and pain at that time in my life when I grew away from them. I didn't despise them exactly, but I felt, well, grand, superior. My father died very suddenly, before we had time to say things. My mother died a year later, of cancer, and we came back to each other before she died. I nursed her and in the last few months we were very close. We don't tell our mothers we admire them enough, do we - or I didn't. She wasn't a woman who talked easily about her emotions. I remember washing her one day and saying \"God Mum, what a lovely nose you've got.\" She said, \"All my life I've hated my nose.\" [Clearly, the anxiety about noses runs in her family.] I thought, how is it I've never told her before how beautiful she is. Her lovely nose.' A year later, Hancock's first husband, the actor Alec Ross, also died of cancer, a long, drawn-out death. 'It was a nasty period, yes. There was a lot of suffering - for them,' she adds hastily, not for her. She coped with the grief and loss by getting involved with the hospice movement. 'You've got to allow yourself the sorrow and then you've got to be practical. I thought: \"I'll do something with these feelings.\" But this is just life,' she says - everyone's life. She's no different, except she is luckier than most people, with money, security, family, a job she loves. 'Life is not continual joy for anyone. Life is something that has to be lived and [she wrinkles up her nose] achieved. We have to earn our right to be here. Interspersed with the struggles are the glorious times. But they cannot be continuous. If you are a thinking person, they cannot be. Even when you are having a wonderful time, you must know there are others who are suffering. Life is not a bowl of cherries. It is a series of things you get over and survive - if you're lucky enough. Some people's life is made up of suffering. I worry when I come across people who expect life to be just happy, who expect to be beautiful and healthy and successful and perfect. Life is a hill you must climb. Just take a deep breath and do it.' Even after those three deaths, Hancock 'always had hope. There's a working-class steeliness in the middle of me, a will to survive.' In 1973 she married Thaw, and they are married still, with three daughters between them, grandchildren whom they adore, a house in France, a cottage in Wiltshire, a flat in London, but, she says, 'a rackety old domestic life really. We work terrible hours.' She insists on their 'ordinariness'. She says they are blessed. Sometimes, she says, they look at their lives and feel proud of how far they have come. 'John'll say: \"Well, a bit of a change from the council flat.\" It can feel unreal. We don't take it for granted, not at all, not for a minute.' Twelve years ago, Sheila Hancock had breast cancer. It did not, she says, 'ennoble' her, but it did teach her to make the most of whatever time she had left, 'although that's simply from getting older, as well. You learn to savour life. You look at a sunset and you realise how wonderful it is. You give yourself the time.' Cancer, she says, with all its attendant pain and fear, was 'nothing, absolutely nothing, I can't even think about it', compared to the emotions she went through 18 months ago when her grandson, Jack, had a brain tumour. 'We could have lost him. Anything else pales into insignificance. I lose a job, so fucking what? Cancer - huh. I couldn't do anything, boss the doctors, make arrangements - that wasn't my job, that was my daughter's job. I could only be there if I was wanted. Crying and praying and waiting. It's the closest I have ever come to not being able to cope.' She puts her hand over her mouth and stares at the memory. She wants to go on working. She wants to learn the piano ('but I want to be brilliant - first not second'). She wants to write a novel (she has the first three chapters but calls them 'crap'). She has just built a sandpit in her garden for her beloved grandchildren. She still has her centre of fear. She remembers once taking part in a show called Night of a Hundred Stars. She was waiting in the wings with Millicent Martin. 'I was dying with fear. I said to Millie, 'Aren't you scared?' and she said 'No, why should I be? I wouldn't be here if they didn't want me.' And she went on and was marvellous and I went on and I was ghastly. I loved her spirit. I love that kind of confidence in women. I have a friend who knows she's pretty, and wonderful. Her parents told her so all her childhood. It's a joy to be with her. She bubbles with pleasure. So in the moment. She's never whingeing or saying, \"Oh, am I all right?\" It must be so tiresome to be with me. People must get so impatient. I bet they want to shake me and shake me.' I don't think so. Hug, maybe.",

There's Dulston, between Islington and Hackney, where Lily Bloom moves when newly dead in 1988. There's Dulburb, its equivalent south of the river. There are insets showing sections of Suffolk, New York and Australia, and everywhere - by the Dome, by Canary Wharf, on the Embankment - there is Nowhere, which turns out to be a chain of theme restaurants recreating outback conditions for jaded metropolitan diners. </p> <p>The afterlife is a huge concern of literature from its beginnings - and its rebeginnings: modern writing began with Eliot seeing the Thames in terms of the Styx. Self is also cannibalising his own beginnings and the early story, 'The North London Book of the Dead'. With his invention of the 'Deathaucracy Office', where you take a number and wait an eternity, he seems to borrow from another medium, Tim Burton's film, Beetlejuice, which contained the additional refinement that the bureaucracy was staffed entirely by suicides - those who chose death being required to administer it. </p> <p>The newly deceased in Burton's film were issued with a handbook explaining the relevant cosmology, for their benefit and ours. In How the Dead Live, it's not so simple. Lily Bloom has a spirit guide in the shape of the Aboriginal Phar Lap, but it takes time for her new reality to sink in. Her body is restored to plumpness - even her lost teeth are returned to her - but she can't smell or taste anything. Out of habit, the dead chew, but they spit instead of swallowing. They don't sleep. Smoking becomes a ghost of itself - no drug effect, no lungs to damage - a sort of placebo addiction. </p> <p>The rules of the afterlife are confusing (perhaps even to their creator, when the unsmelling heroine describes a shop as 'turmeric-scented'), its purpose unclear. Lily attends a meeting of a 12-step group for the 'personally dead', as if life too was an addiction that had to be broken, but finds it unhelpful. Her postmortem reality, and the structure of the novel, corresponds more closely to that other modern division of experience into numbered elements, the five stages of grief. Except that Lily must fully inhabit, and then let go of, all the negative emotions built up over a lifetime. Then she can move on, or back. </p> <p>Lily is American-born (in the 1920s) and Jewish, but Self can't be said to have achieved miracles of impersonation. He gives her two bad marriages and two nasty daughters; he dutifully sketches in a sort of career for her, designing pens; he lays on the feisty Yiddish, but her tone of voice and range of reference - the Molesworth books ('as any fule kno'), late Leonard Cohen, Donne's 'The Relic' - seem close to the author's. Many of Lily's observations, on fashions in sunglasses, or the convergence of running shoes (getting bigger) and cars (getting smaller) - 'Soon people will find themselves inadvertently parking their shoes and putting on their cars' - read like souped-up newspaper columns. </p> <p>Every paragraph contains examples of that joky tweaking that gives so much pleasure to the composers of newspaper headlines: 'Schindler's lift', 'Toque of the devil', 'Sobbed by racks', 'Droving away in stays' and so on. Describing the Admiral Duncan bomb blast, Self itemises the matter pouring into the street: 'straights, queers, the artworks formerly known as prints... trousers, carousers... peanuts, penises...' How many times did this experienced novelist reread the phrase 'the artworks formerly known as prints' and still think it was a good idea, a useful element of fictional technique, to advertise lack of feeling? </p> <p>Beneath the headlines, Self's style is no less contorted, without even a second-hand immediacy: 'Fleet feet fled through flesh' runs one sentence. There's a fatal blurring even in relatively straightforward descriptions: 'He was bald save for a horseshoe of brownish furze, wore a white T-shirt, the trousers from a long-since dismembered suit, and a scowling mien on his crushed, Gladstone face.' Is wearing a scowling mien on your face really any different from scowling? And hasn't the dictionary meaning of 'furze' - a plant with yellow flowers and thick, green spines, a synonym for gorse - been supplanted by irrelevant associations, as if it was a portmanteau word meaning furry fuzz or fuzzy fur? </p> <p>That Self can do better than this is shown by the 20-odd pages set in Australia. Lily's junkie daughter, Natasha, succumbs to a visionary spell and so does her maker. The scales fall from his eyes and he is able to render landscape, culture, character again. Here he risks one of the few purely lyrical sentences in the book, his homage perhaps to the famous passage in Ulysses about the heaventree of stars hung with humid, nightblue fruit: '...stars which hung from the inky sky like bunches of inconceivably heavy, lustrous grapes, dusted with the yeast of eternity'. The moment is almost fine enough to survive being repeated word for word six pages later.</p> <p>At the heart of the novel is a desire to tackle big themes and extreme situations, coupled with an absolute unwillingness to risk being uncool. The tone is one of unvarying contempt - not the 'Thirty-two flavours of Baskin-Robbins best nausea' that Lily refers to, but a dutiful nihilism which over hundreds of pages becomes mysteriously vanilla for lack of anything to contrast with it. </p> <p>If brown is the new black, then contempt is the new self-pity. Lily's anti-Semitism is a safe outrage, since it is Jewish anti-Semitism, as is her misogyny since it is female misogyny. A favourite technique of hers, or of Self's, is to despise someone for despising someone else. Not that the object of the despised person's contempt is ever rehabilitated. It is contempt squared. At one point, contempt is even cubed, when Lily laments the decline in Jewish anti-Semitism: 'To be a Jew-hating Jew used to mean something, you could take pride in it... but nowadays any cut-about little prick can get away with it.' She's a Jewish Jewish-Jew-hater hater. </p> <p>Large sweeps of twentieth-century literature, from C\u00e9line and Beckett to Thomas Bernhard, have seen the world in negative terms. </p> <p>But negativity is no more a qualification in itself than Pollyanna bounciness, if it is used to protect and defend a standard view of things. A steadfastly scowling mien has no more philosophical validity than a Smiley Face. It may seem a perverse criticism of a book like How the Dead Live to say that it lacks vitality. But a book about fish doesn't have scales and a book about death needs a pulse as much as any other, perhaps more than most.</p>",

M&amp;S has never been a place for innovation, but this was really, really dull. Had an edict gone out from the chief executive? 'On no account should any of our cheaper wines contain more than a modicum of flavour. We must not frighten our customers.' </p> <p>Not everything in the range is a yawn - the Chilean, New Zealand, Australian and white Burgundy ranges are all pretty decent, as it happens - but too many of the wines taste as if they've been made to a recipe, and not a very good one at that. The wines aren't faulty, just very safe. They are also over-priced in many cases. Alongside Thresher and Wine Cellar, M&amp;S's margins are some of the highest in the wine business. I once asked an importer what one of his wines would cost on the shelf: '\u00a33.99, or \u00a34.49 at M&amp;S,' was his reply. </p> <p>People who want 'reassurance' from a bottle of vino - marketing speak for a risk-free wine - buy brands. And that's the point about M&amp;S. The company think its brand is an asset, although recent sales figures might have made it reconsider. For the time being, all of M&amp;S's wines are own-labels, sourced from a small number of producers. Fourteen out of a total of 200 wines come from the Italian firm, Girelli; Southcorp in Australia supply 11; Domaine Virginie in the Languedoc 10. Not exactly breadth of choice, folks. </p> <p>Is M&amp;S's wine range part of a trend? When the American giant Wal-Mart bought Asda last year, I feared that dumbed-down ranges could take over the high street. But I've changed my mind since. Retailers like Tesco, Sainsbury, Waitrose, Oddbins, Majestic, Unwins and Wine Rack continue to sell a broad selection of interesting wines. There's no reason why M&amp;S's wines should be such a snore. After all, if the fashion department has conceded that there's life beyond cotton knickers by introducing undies from Agent Provocateur, why can't the wine department follow suit? The rumour is that it won't be long before M&amp;S starts listing wines under producers' names. Doing so would achieve two things: bring a bit of colour to the shelves and, far more importantly, make M&amp;S a fun place to buy wine. Can I put away my Doc Martens now? </p> <p> <strong> 1999 Mcon Villages, Antonin Rodet </strong> (\u00a35.50). Antonin Rodet is one of the most underrated merchant houses in France, as demonstrated by this ripe, buttery, well-balanced white Burgundy. It's a pleasure to taste a Chardonnay in which the grape - rather than oak - is the dominant feature. </p> <p><strong> 1998 Domaine des Lanes, Corbi\u00e8res </strong> (\u00a35.50). Unloved Carignan is the main grape here, supported by Grenache and Syrah. The carbonic maceration technique has tamed Carignan's edges. Soft, juicy and plummy, with lavender, rosemary and thyme. </p> <p><strong> 1998 Sierra Los Andes Merlot/Cabernet Reserve </strong> (\u00a36.99). Made by Alvaro Espinoza, one of my favourite winemakers, this is a classic Chilean blend of Merlot and Cabernet, with a little Carmen\u00e8re. It's fresh, smoky and concentrated, with notes of mint, vanilla and blackcurrant pastille.</p>",

The wines aren't faulty, just very safe. They are also over-priced in many cases. Alongside Thresher and Wine Cellar, M&amp;S's margins are some of the highest in the wine business. I once asked an importer what one of his wines would cost on the shelf: '\u00a33.99, or \u00a34.49 at M&amp;S,' was his reply. People who want 'reassurance' from a bottle of vino - marketing speak for a risk-free wine - buy brands. And that's the point about M&amp;S. The company think its brand is an asset, although recent sales figures might have made it reconsider. For the time being, all of M&amp;S's wines are own-labels, sourced from a small number of producers. Fourteen out of a total of 200 wines come from the Italian firm, Girelli; Southcorp in Australia supply 11; Domaine Virginie in the Languedoc 10. Not exactly breadth of choice, folks. Is M&amp;S's wine range part of a trend? When the American giant Wal-Mart bought Asda last year, I feared that dumbed-down ranges could take over the high street. But I've changed my mind since. Retailers like Tesco, Sainsbury, Waitrose, Oddbins, Majestic, Unwins and Wine Rack continue to sell a broad selection of interesting wines. There's no reason why M&amp;S's wines should be such a snore. After all, if the fashion department has conceded that there's life beyond cotton knickers by introducing undies from Agent Provocateur, why can't the wine department follow suit? The rumour is that it won't be long before M&amp;S starts listing wines under producers' names. Doing so would achieve two things: bring a bit of colour to the shelves and, far more importantly, make M&amp;S a fun place to buy wine. Can I put away my Doc Martens now? 1999 Mcon Villages, Antonin Rodet (\u00a35.50). Antonin Rodet is one of the most underrated merchant houses in France, as demonstrated by this ripe, buttery, well-balanced white Burgundy. It's a pleasure to taste a Chardonnay in which the grape - rather than oak - is the dominant feature. 1998 Domaine des Lanes, Corbi\u00e8res (\u00a35.50). Unloved Carignan is the main grape here, supported by Grenache and Syrah. The carbonic maceration technique has tamed Carignan's edges. Soft, juicy and plummy, with lavender, rosemary and thyme. 1998 Sierra Los Andes Merlot/Cabernet Reserve (\u00a36.99). Made by Alvaro Espinoza, one of my favourite winemakers, this is a classic Chilean blend of Merlot and Cabernet, with a little Carmen\u00e8re. It's fresh, smoky and concentrated, with notes of mint, vanilla and blackcurrant pastille.",

      "body": "<p>I shall not give up the Sunday roast just because the sun has at last deigned to show its face, but the greens-and-potato entourage seems suddenly quite unnecessary. In fact, I am not sure I can face a roast potato when the sun is high in the sky, no matter that I could normally kill for one. There must be a summer alternative. </p> <p>There is salad, of course, but that has always been part of a Sunday lunch for me and, I suspect, for many others who dislike the meat-and-two-veg thing. A roast without a bowl of accompanying floppy leaves is unthinkable, really, and far more efficient than bread or spuds for wiping the gravy from your plate. The bags of ready-washed baby spinach I once wrote off as yet another convenience for the supermarket are in fact perfect for the job, the leaves tender as butter and just what you need to accompany a hunk of pink, garlicky lamb. I dress them with nothing but oil and red-wine vinegar to save the whole thing getting complicated. </p> <p>Salade mesclun - that frilly basket of fris\u00e9e, lamb's lettuce, baby oak leaf, rocket, dandelion and radicchio - is ideal here. This is the salad that one thinks of as sold in quaint wicker baskets in every French street market. Truth told, they too have discovered the supermarket salad pillow-pack. When you can find it, there is a clean and summery lightness to this mixture, and a myriad of flavours, from pepper to lemon. Sometimes I don't dress the leaves at all, letting that job be done by the juices already on my plate. </p> <p>But Sunday lunch is not what it used to be. Much of the pomp has been traded in for something altogether more laid-back. So informal has our sacred roast become, it is a wonder anybody bothers to turn up - but they do, of course, though they are even less likely to be on time than in the winter. It is somehow more difficult to get people to come to the table now that meals are starting to be served out of doors, and I do love my meals in the open air, if only to watch the clouds of bees and ladybirds that have taken up residence in my still-overgrown garden. A Sunday roast in the shade is one of the great pleasures of the British summer, especially now that most of us have finally got the point of putting garlic in the lamb and basil in the salad. </p> <p>A plate is not an essential outdoors. At its most informal, a summer roast can be served between two pieces of bread. This works best when the bread is crusty and the meat is juicy, so you get the same sort of meat-juices-soaking-into-bread effect that you do in a really good hamburger. I like some lettuce in mine, too, something bitter like radicchio, rocket or watercress to offset the sweetness of the meat. The essential bit is remembering to use the juices from the roast to moisten the bread. Failing that, a splash of gravy or even mayonnaise will do. Melted mayonnaise and hot roast beef is surprisingly good. </p> <p>Flavours can be high in the garden. You can get away with any amount of garlic if the sun is out. Anchovies, too. There are several ways of getting garlic into a summer roast, either sliced and pushed deep into the flesh - in which case you need to bore your holes first with a skewer and then widen them with a finger - or tucked, whole and unpeeled, into the ribcage of a bird. You can also introduce it in a marinade for the meat. I often mash rosemary, garlic, salt and olive oil, and massage the resulting paste (it is really more of a savoury slush) into the lamb, chicken or pork. This tends to work most effectively if the joint has flesh you can get at - a loosely rolled loin, say, rather than a leg that is wholly encased in fat. </p> <p>But you can make garlic butter, too, and slather it on to the bread just as you put on the sliced meat. The hot meat will melt the butter and soak into the loaf. Before you know it, you have the best sandwich in the world on your hands - not to mention your chin and your shirt. Just think of it: crisp bread, warm garlicky meat juices, soft salad leaves, and the buzz-buzz of bees in the garden. Of course the reality is that no one took the bread out of the plastic carrier bag and it's gone limp overnight, the lamb is overcooked, three people don't want garlic, and the bumblebees turn out to be flying ants. But get it right and we are talking of a light, casual Sunday lunch just as good as the piled plates so welcome in the depths of winter. The garlic butter option, incidentally, is a boon for those families who have not brought the children up on garlic and might otherwise have to roast a little one without it just for them. </p> <p>So, if we are having a herbal roast either on a plate, with salad afterwards, or sliced and stuffed inside a wodge of crackly baguette with garlic mayonnaise or a slice of herb butter, then what do we have to follow? A bowl of English cherries, perhaps, served on crushed ice so their crimson flesh tightens up, or strawberries that you have hulled and halved and left to marinate a while with orange zest, passion fruit juice and mint. </p> <p> <strong> Roast lamb with oregano and anchovy</strong> </p> <p> The olive oil and garlic rub give a salty, herbal note to the meat, and to its fat. If you are eating this in a sandwich, then you could use either of the butters below. Mixed salad leaves or baby spinach would be quite perfect. Especially when they wilt from the heat of the meat. For a very informal lunch, you will need some sourdough bread or crusty white rolls. </p> <p>a small leg of lamb </p> <p><strong> for the rub</strong> </p> <p>4 cloves of garlic, peeled </p> <p>6 anchovy fillets, rinsed </p> <p>a small palmful of dried oregano </p> <p>6 tbsps olive oil </p> <p>Make the rub: crush the garlic with a little salt under the flat of a knife blade, then scrape the resulting slush into a small bowl. Chop the anchovies very finely, then stir them, along with the dried oregano and a grinding of black pepper, into the garlic. Beat in the olive oil with a fork or small whisk. </p> <p>Lay the lamb in a roasting tin and massage with the herbal rub, making sure to get into the exposed flesh as much as you can. Set aside for at least half an hour, or longer, if you can. </p> <p>Set the oven at 200 C/gas mark 6, roast the lamb for 15 minutes per 500g, plus an extra 20 minutes. This will give you lamb that is pink inside. </p> <p>Let the meat rest for 15 minutes in the switched-off oven with the door open before carving. </p> <p> <strong> Roast chicken baps with lime and mint</strong> </p> <p> Citrus fruits add a welcome sharpness to summer roasts. This could mean merely pushing a halved lemon up a chicken's backside as it roasts, but may also involve a marinade. In warm weather, the oil-rich winter herbs, such as thyme and bay, can be replaced with the softer varieties, such as mint and lemon verbena. Rather than roasting an entire bird for what amounts to little more than a posh sandwich, choose breasts and thighs, and pull the meat from the bones when they come from the oven. </p> <p>6 free-range chicken pieces, bone in (thighs </p> <p>and breasts) </p> <p><strong> for the marinade</strong> </p> <p>a healthy bunch of mint </p> <p>2 juicy cloves of garlic </p> <p>the juice of two large, juicy lemons </p> <p>an equal amount of fruity olive oil </p> <p>6 soft, floury baps or crusty rolls </p> <p>mayonnaise or garlic mayonnaise for spreading, </p> <p>or one of the butters below </p> <p>Pull the leaves from the mint and discard the stems, then chop the leaves roughly. Peel and crush the garlic and mix it with the lemon juice, oil and a few turns of the peppermill. You will have a loose paste. </p> <p>Lay the chicken in a shallow dish and rub it with the lemon and mint. Set aside somewhere cool, but not cold, for an hour or so. Set the oven at 200 C/ gas mark 6, grind over a little salt, then roast the chicken for30-40 minutes, occasionally turning over the pieces so that they colour nicely all over. </p> <p>Remove from the oven and, when the meat has cooled enough to handle, pull it from the bones - it should come away easily in thick, juicy strips. Split the rolls or baps and spread the cut sides generously with mayonnaise, then lay some washed watercress or rocket on the bottom halves. Toss the torn chicken in any oil that is left in the dish, then stuff it into the rolls with watercress or rocket. </p> <p> <strong> A few good things to put in your sandwich </strong></p> <p><strong> Garlic butter</strong> </p> <p>Peel and crush four new-season white garlic cloves with a little salt. They need to be squashed to a pulp. Mash them with 100g of butter and a small handful of chopped parsley. Warm the butter gently in a small pan, pour over the cut sides of the bread so it soaks down, then add the leaves and sliced meat. This is especially good with roast lamb. </p> <p><strong> Tarragon mustard butter</strong> </p> <p>Pull the leaves from a small bunch of tarragon and chop them quite finely. Mash with 100g of soft butter, a little salt and 1 tbsp of Dijon mustard. Spread on to the bread and place the hot roast meat on it so it softens even further but does not quite melt.</p>",

Because the longer monarchs live, the longer those waiting to step into their cooling shoes must wait. And the longer they wait - oh joy - the more likely it is that either they will go so bizarrely off the rails in some drug-fuelled, crime-orgy (sorry; I'm a journalist; I can't help fantasising) that the public will refuse to have them on the throne, or their will to succeed will simply be sapped by the passage of time and they will disappear off to do something else instead. </p> <p>Already Charles is 51. For almost two decades now commentators have written about his quest for a point to his life, an answer to which the plants that he talks at could never provide. Certainly his predicament is not without precedent. King Edward VII would doubtless have been a much happier chap if his mother, Queen Victoria, had only had the good grace to die within a reasonable period of time. Edward's exploits - his affairs with married women, for example - contributed to a crisis of confidence in the monarchy so severe that the Prime Minister of the day, Disraeli, had to intervene to reinvent the institution to save it from the mob. </p> <p>Like Edward, Charles has already made his own contribution to a crisis of confidence in the monarchy - through his affair with a married woman, for example - and there's lots more time left in which to stir things up, without any chance of the PM coming to the rescue. If his mother makes it to within 10 years of her own mother's lifespan - and there's no particular reason to think that she won't do just as well - Charles will be deep into his seventies by the time he succeeds, and perhaps into his eighties. So steeped in duty is he, so uptight and buttoned down, that doubtless he will see it through. </p> <p>But what will happen to the next generation in line? Will William, who has already seen the institution destroy his mother, really be fagged to hang around hoping to inherit a job which - given Charles' age when he became a father - won't be his until he is at least 60? Might he not achieve a more fulfilling life, away from the paparazzo's gaze, if he went off to his Argentinean cattle ranch for his gap year - and just stayed there? </p> <p>Much of this damage to the royal family through longevity is, of course, self-inflicted. In the good old days monarchs could be relied upon to turn procreation into a literally political act that secured successions. The result was that Europe was ruled by what, in the American South, they still call PECFs. (The 'F' stands for a word that should not be used in a family paper, but the other letters stand for 'Pink' 'Eyed' and 'Cousin'.) Queen Victoria, for example, was famed for carrying a vibrant strain of haemophilia which, through the marriages of her children, wreaked havoc in European royalty for generations. </p> <p>Now, however, the Windsors have chosen to stop keeping it in the family and have married out, thus rather widening the gene pool. It is significant that Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, has been invited to this week's party despite her estrangement from Prince Andrew. She may be an embarrassment but, through Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, she is much needed new blood (if also a source of very silly girls' names). Likewise, Prince William is living proof that the gene for jug ears need not dominate. </p> <p>So the stock is hale and hearty. The question is, what can those of us who wish to be citizens of a republic rather than subjects of a monarchy do to promote this longevity; a trend which, while keeping the royal family alive, will eventually kill the concept of royalty. The answer, I think, lies in the example of Princess Margaret, who has been kept going by the attentions of her doctors: we should make sure that the royals continue to get the very best medical care available.

      "body": "<p>Above the desk of Channel 5 programme controller Dawn Airey is a large photograph of Xena, Warrior Princess, complete with leather bodice and her trademark 'have a go' snarl. It's not a bad choice for Airey. True, she lacks Xena's physical presence and her taste in battle-friendly bondage gear; she is a slight, woman, who dresses more for efficiency than power. </p> <p>But, like the trash idol who has helped define the three-year-old station's image, Airey is eminently capable of looking after herself. 'I am,' she says, when we meet, 'open, direct, straightforward and a bit chippy. I don't take things too seriously. I believe in freedom and a pluralistic society, but one with respect for other people.' She is, she says, much like the channel she programmes. </p> <p>It helps. The past seven days have been a week of two halves for Channel 5: Airey has had to defend a billion-pound business which by all the usual indicators - market share, market growth, advertising revenue, company valuation - is a raging success, but which is a failure to its vehement critics. </p> <p>The week began with the backwash from the screening, 10 days ago, of Naked Jungle, a game show in which the presenter, Keith Chegwin, and all the contestants appeared in the nude, as part of a week marking the fiftieth anniversary of British naturism. Sections of the press, which had roused themselves to climactic levels of fury over the show, gleefully reported that Culture Secretary Chris Smith had made a speech in the Commons calling on Channel 5 to clean up its act. </p> <p>'We phoned the Ministry of Culture,' Airey says, 'and they were very embarrassed. Smith was simply responding to a question about broadcasters' responsibilities, and said he was aware concerns had been expressed.' </p> <p>Such controversies are, she argues, as double-edged as Xena's trusty sword. Sure, it attracts attention to the station and that can be handy, but it's often of the wrong sort. Airey repeatedly argues that the station's adult programming - programmes like X-Certificate, about the blue movie business, and uncut adult films - constitutes less than 2 per cent of output. It attracts attention because it is, like the woman herself, straightforward and direct. </p> <p>'We do not go out of our way to offend our viewers. It would be lunacy to do so. Of course it's enormously flattering that the Daily Mail thinks we're worth the front page. But the depressing fact is that there are so many other things on Channel 5 worth writing about.' </p> <p>She was once quoted as saying that Channel 5 is about the 'three fs: football, films and fucking'. She now wants to correct that: 'What I actually said was that it was not just about the three fs.' </p> <p>So why not drop the third f, if it causes so much trouble? 'If you're a new kid on the block with modest resources, you either have to be better than everyone else or you have to be different. Our adult programming is different, which is why it gets noticed. I don't mind people noticing it, but I do mind people saying it's low-rent programming. It's not. It's quality stuff.' </p> <p>In any case, she says, it's not the adult programmes that attracted Channel 5's very healthy 5.9 per cent share of the TV audience, and its growth of 16 per cent year on year, when almost everybody else was recording losses. They amount to only 2 per cent of the output, so they couldn't. It's about the other two fs and more besides. </p> <p>Not that filling the sched ule in an increasingly Balkanised television business is always easy, particularly when you have just a third of Channel 4's programming budget and a sixth of the money available to BBC1. As the furore over the televising of Keith Chegwin's penis died down last week, Airey had to sit by and watch as the long- distance telephone number- sized deals for football rights were announced. </p> <p>Channel 5 has achieved remarkable viewing figures by snatching up rights for the esoterica of European football. Last week's spending spree proved that there is no longer such a thing as a cheap top-flight match. </p> <p>'The days when we could get a Poland v England match for just \u00a31 million, as we did just after launch, are clearly gone,' Airey says. 'By nature everybody at Channel 5 is very competitive. But we're also very realistic. We may not be able to play these big money games, but that doesn't mean we can look to the top table for some crumbs.' </p> <p>She dismisses the idea that the BBC could trample on their patch. When the corporation has bought up the sort of European rights Channel 5 has specialised in, they have screened them on BBC2 and dragged in fewer viewers than Channel 5 would have mustered. 'What they need is matches for BBC1,' she says. And that is entirely different. </p> <p>In many ways it is the distinction between what Channel 5 can do with a match and what BBC2 can do with it that defines the newer channel. Unlike Channel 4, which was born out of some notion of diversity in broadcasting, Channel 5 was created simply to satisfy the appetite of advertisers, which wanted somewhere else to flog stuff. It follows that the channel has little to gain from stealing viewers from ITV or Channel 4. Its target has to be the corporation. </p> <p>'So we schedule aggressively against BBC1,' Airey says. 'If they are showing football, we'll put on a female-friendly movie. And when the football finishes, we'll schedule something to bring the male audience to us.' </p> <p>This is clearly the stuff Airey loves most; she reads television schedules like others read weather maps. She knows what will make the rain fall, and what will make the sun shine. She has an instinct for a weakness in a competitor's line-up and will rush to fill the gap. </p> <p>The result of this complete understanding of the channel's market niche is, she says, an extremely lean and efficient business. She proudly rattles off the cost of each full percentage point of audience share: \u00a326.7 million for BBC1; \u00a338.6m for Channel 4; and just \u00a321m for Channel 5. The problem is, such boasts play to the critics' complaints that the programming is literally very cheap. </p> <p>Airey will not take that. 'We're proud of what we do,' she says, simply. 'Criticise Channel 5 and you're criticising me and my mates.' And, as she says it, your gaze can not help but rise to the severe image of Xena behind her. It would perhaps be wise not to get Airey angry.</p>",

Tiredness is a sickness and sleep is the cure but, like all medicines, it can have side-effects. You emerge from 'sleep as medicine' drugged and woozy. You emerge in need of a perfect night's sleep. </p> <p>So it can come only after a sybaritic state of drowsiness, where bed becomes the most appealing place to be rather than the only place. And that bed must be your own. Over the past 10 months, I have spent nights away from my wife and child and imagined, in advance, a night unbroken by cries in the night. But it's never happened that way. No, you need your own bed covered with your own sheets; not new ones, which chafe like stiff shoes, but old ones, clean and crisp. </p> <p>But this is the most important thing about the perfect night's sleep: you must enter it knowing there is nothing to trouble you on the other side. No work that must be done. And, most importantly, no darling children to be cleaned and fed and reassured. This is the great irony: the perfect night's sleep is not defined by how you become unconscious or how you stay that way, but how you come out of it, slowly and gently, with the sunlight dancing behind the curtains.

Tiredness is a sickness and sleep is the cure but, like all medicines, it can have side-effects. You emerge from 'sleep as medicine' drugged and woozy. You emerge in need of a perfect night's sleep. So it can come only after a sybaritic state of drowsiness, where bed becomes the most appealing place to be rather than the only place. And that bed must be your own. Over the past 10 months, I have spent nights away from my wife and child and imagined, in advance, a night unbroken by cries in the night. But it's never happened that way. No, you need your own bed covered with your own sheets; not new ones, which chafe like stiff shoes, but old ones, clean and crisp. But this is the most important thing about the perfect night's sleep: you must enter it knowing there is nothing to trouble you on the other side. No work that must be done. And, most importantly, no darling children to be cleaned and fed and reassured. This is the great irony: the perfect night's sleep is not defined by how you become unconscious or how you stay that way, but how you come out of it, slowly and gently, with the sunlight dancing behind the curtains. As the Bard said, to sleep, perchance to dream...",

      "body": "<p>A little while ago, a senior editor on this newspaper invited me to lunch. 'And bring a ruler,' he said. 'We're going to Pizza Express.' My boss reckoned he had spotted a story: the pizzas at Pizza Express were, he said, getting smaller. So we sat in a north London branch and when our pizzas arrived we measured them. They were exactly nine inches, as they have always been. To be fair, he was hardly the first male to have a problem estimating nine inches by eye alone, but I think his nose for a story was absolutely spot on - if Pizza Express had been trying to subtly reduce the size of its product, an enormous slab of the British middle classes would have risen up in revolt. </p> <p>Pizza Express occupies a very particular place in the affections of the British: it is a fast-food joint that is not too fast, a reliable dispensary of food sprightly enough to appeal to children and sophisticated enough to appeal to their parents who, eating there, can again feel like adults. A few years ago, after a period of expansion through franchising, the parent company recognised that standards were slipping and bought back all but three of its branches. The good management of its brand requires simply that nothing must change. Well, almost nothing. Because, for the first time in more than a decade, the company has had a rush of blood to the head. It has introduced four new pizzas. </p> <p>I visited the branch in Tunbridge Wells, a branch much like any other of the 240 odd in Britain: cool white walls, potted palms, a smattering of tasteful modern art, light jazz on the stereo. And so, too, the lunchtime clientele. Here, a table of mothers with their collected brood; over there, grandparents spoiling the next generation; by one window, a works lunch; by another, a single woman finishing a bottle of sparkling mineral water. Witness, then, the middle classes at rest. </p> <p>Of the four new pizzas, I chose the one I would be least likely normally to order: the Caprina, with sun-dried tomatoes and goat's cheese, at \u00a35.90. The goat's cheese was salty and rich, and the chopped sun-dried tomatoes were pleasingly soft. As for the base, it was, as ever, that careful balance between chewy and crispy. There's a sensible list of Italian wines from about a tenner to \u00a314 but, this being a lunchtime, I was not in the mood for wine. I had a Coke and a side salad, and the bill came to a little over \u00a310, including service. You can't really gripe, can you? </p> <p>A little later, I tried the other three pizzas from a newish branch in Kennington, south London. The one guaranteed to find a particular audience among 10-year-old boys is the Sloppy Giuseppe, \u00a35.95, a pretty brutal combination of spiced beef, green peppers, chilli and cayenne which, if it were not for the base, would be more at home at Pizza Hut. It's a crude flavour kick. </p> <p>The Soho Pizza, at the same price, is testament to just how successful the food revolution has been in Britain, depending as it does on a good handful of fresh rocket to cover the topping of Parmesan, olives, garlic and mozzarella. The result is a subtle pizza, the softness of the peppery rocket working well against the bite of the olives. But for me, the winner is the Pizza alle Noci, \u00a35.85, an unctuous assembly of walnuts, lemon zest and gorgonzola. </p> <p>So change is abroad, in a place where the clientele least like it.

      "body": "<p>We gave a Fork to Fork talk and demonstration at Hay Literary Festival the other week, which ended with questions from the audience. My children, who had acted as waiters, dishing out portions of spinach, orache and bacon salad, were astonished that grown-ups could ask so many questions about carrot fly or the intricacies of making compost. But as you slump into adulthood, the garden acts as a sump to absorb all the displaced anxieties that hedge every adult action. So much easier to agonise about the construction of the compost heap than the shreds and tatters of your life. </p> <p>At the moment, the repository of my troubles is not the compost heap, which is doing fine, but this year's pea crop. My pea failure nags away at me. I like a pea. Everyone likes peas. Every garden has to have at least one row of peas - a symbol of freshness and productivity and a practical contribution to the table. Fresh peas, shovelled from the pod straight into your mouth, are a rolling green absolute. You measure other pleasures by it. If I live to be 100, I shall not forget the sight of my daughter Freya, seen from the bathroom window, her long auburn hair curling in tendrils, pea-like, quietly munching her way along a row of peas at seven o'clock on a sunny July morning. If you have children, it is worth growing peas - even just half a dozen plants growing up a wigwam in a pot - just so the kids can eat them raw and know what peas really taste like. </p> <p>They have been part of European gardens for thousands of years, primarily for their ability to be stored, dried and then cooked to make a nutritious porridge. It seems the luxury of growing them just to shell and eat straightaway only began in the 16th century. Peas freeze better than almost any other vegetable, although to get the best of a pea, you must eat it within hours of picking, before the sugar starts to turn to starch. This is easy to do at home, although we never freeze peas because commercially frozen ones are very good and, anyway, we hardly freeze anything in its raw state, preferring when possible to eat things fresh as they come into season. I don't want peas in January any more than I want warm, wet, grey days without break from November right through to March. </p> <p>But I do like peas in June, and I do not have any ready yet. Reading William Cobbett (The English Gardener , Bloomsbury Classics, \u00a314.99), I see that this means I am either an incompetent, or just thoroughly unmanly. He writes: 'Ever since I became a man, I can recollect that it was always deemed rather a sign of bad gardening if there were not green peas in the garden fit to gather on the fourth of June.' I am writing this on the fourth of June, and there's not a single green pea fit to gather in the garden. Cobbett does go on to say that 'to have them at this season, the very earliest sort must be sowed... in November, and they must be sowed on the south side of a wall... the ground not being wet in its nature by any means'. </p> <p>I did sow my peas in early December and, not having a wall at all, let alone a south side of one, and knowing how wet and cold our soil gets, I sowed them in pots. This is laborious, but four trays of 24 4in pots, two peas to each, were duly sown. They were an early variety, Feltham First, bred to survive more cold than later varieties. They were then put in a cold frame, watered and looked at daily for signs of incipient pea-ness. Nothing happened followed by nothing more. Eventually, of those 192 peas, precisely 10 germinated. These 10 are now producing flat pods in my daughter's piece of garden (decorated defiantly in the Home-Front-in-the-Garden school of design - all pink- and blue-painted pebbles, painted trellis, zinnias and tobacco plants. She does it because it teases, but I secretly love it and, other than my pitiful peas, she has grown everything from seed herself). The other 182 rotted. The trouble was that I used a potting mix with too much of our own loam in it, and this acted as a sponge. The lesson is to add plenty of grit to the ground for early sowings and make the compost sharp if sowing them in pots. </p> <p>I sowed a batch of 'Alderman' in March and some 'Hurst Greenshaft' and 'Sugar Snap' in early May. Germination has been erratic, but there will be some sort of crop from all of them. However, attacks by mice and pigeons are common. Cloches help on early sowings, and earthing up (drawing the soil up along the row with a hoe) secures the roots and makes it harder for mice. </p> <p>All garden peas crop much better if they are supported - ideally by pea sticks, if you can get them, or by netting supported along the row by canes. Modern pea breeding has concentrated on producing short-growing peas to make mechanised harvesting easier. But taller varieties take up no more space in the garden, and are likely to ripen better and crop more vigorously over a longer period. 'Alderman' is a particularly tall variety, reaching over 6ft in rich soil. Height is a virtue in the kitchen garden, adding much-needed green texture. And pea sticks look tremendous when staked out along the rows: they have that wonderful mix of aesthetic beauty and functional purpose that a hedge has. </p> <p>Mangetout and sugar-snap peas are eaten pods and all. The former never really develop proper peas and retain flat pods, and the latter do so slowly, which means if you do not pick them regularly you can harvest the maturing peas and eat them as a normal variety. Both are without the hard wall to the pod that conventional peas have. There is a lot to be said for growing sugar snaps if you have limited space and limited patience for the bother of shelling peas. I veer between a nostalgic, glowing pleasure at the business of shelling peas around the kitchen table and an impatient desire for the fast-food immediacy of sugar snaps. Purple-podded peas are hard to get hold of, but worth growing if you can find them because they look absolutely lovely. </p> <p>They can either be sown in drills a few inches deep, in a single row with each pea spaced two or three inches apart, or, as I do, in wider, flatter drills with two rows spaced four or five inches apart. Cobbett says firmly that there is no advantage in sowing more than single rows. Each pair of rows will need room to walk between, so should be 3ft apart. Again, Cobbett violently disagrees, insisting that each row should be 6ft or more apart, and goes into a long story of how his gardener had disobediently sown rows a mere 3ft apart but was proved wrong after a heavy rain 'smashed the whole of them down into one mass... the destroyed patch was, however, of precious advantage; for it made me the master of my gardener'. Much as I revere Cobbett, his advice is only applicable to the biggest of gardens or allotments and, anyway, my ambitions are more modest: I only seek to be master of my peas. </p> <p> Preparing the ground for perfect peas </p> <p>Peas take nitrogen from the air into the soil via warty nodules on their roots.This makes them an essential component in the rotation of vegetables in the garden.

Leave the pods on the plant as long as possible, lifting the whole plant just before the pods start to split. Hang up the plant in a dry shed or store the pods on a tray until they split open. Collect the peas and store them in an airtight container or paper bag in a cool, dry place.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Hollywood's treatment of one of postwar America's most revered novels, John Steinbeck's The Pearl, has come under fire this weekend from family members for its graphic sex scenes. </p> <p>The Steinbeck estate claims that the little-known film-maker Alfredo Zacharias's script - currently being filmed in Mexico starring Richard Harris and Lukas Hass - fabricates nude scenes and distorts the much-loved original. </p> <p>Published in 1947, The Pearl is regarded as one of America's greatest postwar novels: a simple tale of a Mexican peasant fisherman's discovery of a pearl at the bottom of a lake. In The Pearl, Steinbeck documented all the hopes and travails of the American dream - as viewed by immigrants and natives themselves. The book was published to resounding critical and commercial success, and remains prescribed reading in American schools to this day. </p> <p>The Steinbeck estate has sought to bring the book to the screen since the early Nineties. Previous film adaptations of Steinbeck's novels have always stayed faithful to the source material.

      "bodyText": "Hollywood's treatment of one of postwar America's most revered novels, John Steinbeck's The Pearl, has come under fire this weekend from family members for its graphic sex scenes. The Steinbeck estate claims that the little-known film-maker Alfredo Zacharias's script - currently being filmed in Mexico starring Richard Harris and Lukas Hass - fabricates nude scenes and distorts the much-loved original. Published in 1947, The Pearl is regarded as one of America's greatest postwar novels: a simple tale of a Mexican peasant fisherman's discovery of a pearl at the bottom of a lake. In The Pearl, Steinbeck documented all the hopes and travails of the American dream - as viewed by immigrants and natives themselves. The book was published to resounding critical and commercial success, and remains prescribed reading in American schools to this day. The Steinbeck estate has sought to bring the book to the screen since the early Nineties. Previous film adaptations of Steinbeck's novels have always stayed faithful to the source material. The Elia Kazan-directed East of Eden, released in 1954 and starring James Dean, devotedly stuck to the original text. The film received four Oscar nominations. Similarly, The Grapes of Wrath - Steinbeck's fictional account of migrant labour workers during the Depression years - was magnificently rendered by director John Ford.

      "trailText": "<p>Bill Bradshaw talks to Fred Trueman about his memories of Brian Statham, who died last weekend</p>",
      "byline": "Bill Bradshaw",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Freddie Trueman spent yesterday following England's fortunes against the West Indies, but he would far rather have been at Old Trafford to keep a date he intended to honour for his best cricketing pal, Brian Statham. </p> <p>Statham, one half of arguably England's finest new-ball partnership, died last weekend and his funeral took place on Friday. Trueman, as usual, was there for his old friend who would have celebrated his seventieth birthday yesterday. That landmark, one which Statham would not quite reach, was to have been the trigger for a dinner in his honour at his cricketing home in Manchester, as Trueman explains: </p> <p>'We never lost touch. I'm going to miss him greatly. I spoke with Lancashire's Jim Cumbes and their financial man, Murray Bernie, about putting on a dinner for Brian to mark his birthday. We were all for it but when we realised how poorly he was, we had to think again.' </p> <p>Fred raised a glass in memory of his old friend on Friday. Trueman and Statham. The names roll off the tongue and go together like ham and eggs and, well, mild and bitter. Both men were fond of their drink after a hard day's play but Trueman gives way. </p> <p>'It's true we both liked to have a drink, but I wasn't in Brian's league,' he says. 'He loved to unwind with cigarettes and beer - well, lager actually. That was his drink. He rarely got drunk - not nastily anyway. But he could put a lot away. I always knew if he'd had a heavy night because his fingers would be black from smoking. </p> <p>'My favourite drinking story about George - his nickname because Lancashire always had a George in their team and when they suddenly found themselves without one, Brian volunteered - occurred during a tour to the West Indies. </p> <p>'We really were good mates and I roomed with him. One night we set out for the local cinema in British Guyana. A few of the lads were there and the usherette asked George if he wanted ice cream or nuts. </p> <p>'He replied: \"No, I'd rather have a lager\". We all laughed, but a few minutes later the lass was back with a tray full of lagers. I've never seen anything like it and he was really made up. It made the cowboy picture seem a bit better!' </p> <p>Trueman first met Statham in 1950 when Trueman's Yorkshire played Lancashire. They introduced themselves to one another and so began a lifelong friendship, cemented when they became England colleagues for the first time in 1954 in the West Indies. </p> <p>'We both got the chance to bowl at George Headley, a West Indies legend who had played before I was born,' said Trueman. 'It was an honour as they had brought him back for the first Test of that series. In truth, he shouldn't have been out there, but I was glad of the privilege and so was Brian - even though we lost by 10 wickets. </p> <p>'We got on well and liked similar things. We both liked to put our feet up in the dressing room, watch our batsmen face the opposition bowlers and, best of all, we were complementary to one another as bowlers.' </p> <p>Although Statham is always mentioned in dispatches with Trueman, they often played with other partners. 'Of my 67 Tests for England, only 30-odd were with Brian. But there is no doubt he contributed to a lot of my Test victims and probably vice versa. </p> <p>'We hunted in our own pack. That's because I moved the ball mainly away from the right-handed batsman while George moved it into them. If we had a left-hand, right-hand batting pairing against us, we'd often give them a single to enable me to bowl to the right-hander and Brian the left-hander... because his ball would then be moving away from a leftie. And the ball moving away is always considered the more dangerous delivery because there is less margin for error for the batsman. </p> <p>'I also recall a series against South Africa in 1960 when George tipped me off about their batsman Peter Carlstein. He said he'd be a sucker for my fast yorker. He was spot on. I got him all right. </p> <p>'Another time I had West Indies batsman Easton McMorris caught off his glove, but the umpire gave him not out. Later their captain, Gerry Alexander, asked Peter May, our captain, if they could bring Rohan Kanhai in because McMorris had gone to hospital to have his hand checked. I was livid and wanted to go after him when he came back, but never got the chance. He was at the other end and Brian put in a short one, hit him in the chest and he had to be taken off, coughing up blood. If you upset me then you upset Brian Statham, too - and the reverse was undoubtedly true.' </p> <p>On another occasion, when Fred Titmus and wicketkeeper John Murray made their Test debuts, Statham reprimanded the pair for trying to run out the last man. Trueman recalls: 'He said: \"What do you think you're doing - you don't run out number 10s or 11s. They're for me and Freddie!\".' </p> <p>The pair were born just eight months apart - Trueman was the junior partner - and their careers ended at much the same time both at Test (1965) and county level. Trueman quit Yorkshire in 1968 and found himself interviewing Statham for Granada TV after his friend's decision to say farewell. </p> <p>'I told George that I was going and he said that he'd had enough too,' Trueman remembers. 'Yorkshire wanted me to stay and be captain but I'd decided enough was enough. They said at Headingley we were the best-paid cricketers in the land, but I know George was on \u00a3500 a year more than me - we'd both had enough. Sixteen years at the top is a long stint.' </p> <p>While Trueman continued media work that had started while he was in his playing prime, Statham struggled in retirement. Fred nods in agreement but smiles at the thought: 'Brian had a fascination with work - he could sit and watch it all day!' By the late Eighties, Statham had fallen on hard times, but Trueman, once alerted, went into action and was the driving force behind a Statham testimonial dinner in London at the Grosvenor House Hotel. More than 1,000 guests turned up to pay tribute and help out Statham. </p> <p>'The response was terrific,' says Trueman. 'We were able to buy George a car, help sort out their kitchen at home and invest something to provide him with something of a pension. The south of England really rallied round but, strangely, we found it harder going in Manchester where he had been a hero. There are some hypocrites around who are saying nice things now who were thin on the ground 11 years ago.' </p> <p>For all that, one of Trueman's fondest memories comes from that period when he walked into an Old Trafford marquee with Statham. 'We were making a presentation,' he recalls. 'And when we walked into the place there was an impromptu standing ovation. It was lovely, absolutely lovely. He may be gone but definitely not forgotten - especially by me.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Freddie Trueman spent yesterday following England's fortunes against the West Indies, but he would far rather have been at Old Trafford to keep a date he intended to honour for his best cricketing pal, Brian Statham. Statham, one half of arguably England's finest new-ball partnership, died last weekend and his funeral took place on Friday. Trueman, as usual, was there for his old friend who would have celebrated his seventieth birthday yesterday. That landmark, one which Statham would not quite reach, was to have been the trigger for a dinner in his honour at his cricketing home in Manchester, as Trueman explains: 'We never lost touch. I'm going to miss him greatly. I spoke with Lancashire's Jim Cumbes and their financial man, Murray Bernie, about putting on a dinner for Brian to mark his birthday. We were all for it but when we realised how poorly he was, we had to think again.' Fred raised a glass in memory of his old friend on Friday. Trueman and Statham. The names roll off the tongue and go together like ham and eggs and, well, mild and bitter. Both men were fond of their drink after a hard day's play but Trueman gives way. 'It's true we both liked to have a drink, but I wasn't in Brian's league,' he says. 'He loved to unwind with cigarettes and beer - well, lager actually. That was his drink. He rarely got drunk - not nastily anyway. But he could put a lot away. I always knew if he'd had a heavy night because his fingers would be black from smoking. 'My favourite drinking story about George - his nickname because Lancashire always had a George in their team and when they suddenly found themselves without one, Brian volunteered - occurred during a tour to the West Indies. 'We really were good mates and I roomed with him. One night we set out for the local cinema in British Guyana. A few of the lads were there and the usherette asked George if he wanted ice cream or nuts. 'He replied: \"No, I'd rather have a lager\". We all laughed, but a few minutes later the lass was back with a tray full of lagers. I've never seen anything like it and he was really made up. It made the cowboy picture seem a bit better!' Trueman first met Statham in 1950 when Trueman's Yorkshire played Lancashire. They introduced themselves to one another and so began a lifelong friendship, cemented when they became England colleagues for the first time in 1954 in the West Indies. 'We both got the chance to bowl at George Headley, a West Indies legend who had played before I was born,' said Trueman. 'It was an honour as they had brought him back for the first Test of that series. In truth, he shouldn't have been out there, but I was glad of the privilege and so was Brian - even though we lost by 10 wickets. 'We got on well and liked similar things. We both liked to put our feet up in the dressing room, watch our batsmen face the opposition bowlers and, best of all, we were complementary to one another as bowlers.' Although Statham is always mentioned in dispatches with Trueman, they often played with other partners. 'Of my 67 Tests for England, only 30-odd were with Brian. But there is no doubt he contributed to a lot of my Test victims and probably vice versa. 'We hunted in our own pack. That's because I moved the ball mainly away from the right-handed batsman while George moved it into them. If we had a left-hand, right-hand batting pairing against us, we'd often give them a single to enable me to bowl to the right-hander and Brian the left-hander... because his ball would then be moving away from a leftie. And the ball moving away is always considered the more dangerous delivery because there is less margin for error for the batsman. 'I also recall a series against South Africa in 1960 when George tipped me off about their batsman Peter Carlstein. He said he'd be a sucker for my fast yorker. He was spot on. I got him all right. 'Another time I had West Indies batsman Easton McMorris caught off his glove, but the umpire gave him not out. Later their captain, Gerry Alexander, asked Peter May, our captain, if they could bring Rohan Kanhai in because McMorris had gone to hospital to have his hand checked. I was livid and wanted to go after him when he came back, but never got the chance. He was at the other end and Brian put in a short one, hit him in the chest and he had to be taken off, coughing up blood. If you upset me then you upset Brian Statham, too - and the reverse was undoubtedly true.' On another occasion, when Fred Titmus and wicketkeeper John Murray made their Test debuts, Statham reprimanded the pair for trying to run out the last man. Trueman recalls: 'He said: \"What do you think you're doing - you don't run out number 10s or 11s. They're for me and Freddie!\".' The pair were born just eight months apart - Trueman was the junior partner - and their careers ended at much the same time both at Test (1965) and county level. Trueman quit Yorkshire in 1968 and found himself interviewing Statham for Granada TV after his friend's decision to say farewell. 'I told George that I was going and he said that he'd had enough too,' Trueman remembers. 'Yorkshire wanted me to stay and be captain but I'd decided enough was enough. They said at Headingley we were the best-paid cricketers in the land, but I know George was on \u00a3500 a year more than me - we'd both had enough. Sixteen years at the top is a long stint.' While Trueman continued media work that had started while he was in his playing prime, Statham struggled in retirement. Fred nods in agreement but smiles at the thought: 'Brian had a fascination with work - he could sit and watch it all day!' By the late Eighties, Statham had fallen on hard times, but Trueman, once alerted, went into action and was the driving force behind a Statham testimonial dinner in London at the Grosvenor House Hotel. More than 1,000 guests turned up to pay tribute and help out Statham. 'The response was terrific,' says Trueman. 'We were able to buy George a car, help sort out their kitchen at home and invest something to provide him with something of a pension. The south of England really rallied round but, strangely, we found it harder going in Manchester where he had been a hero. There are some hypocrites around who are saying nice things now who were thin on the ground 11 years ago.' For all that, one of Trueman's fondest memories comes from that period when he walked into an Old Trafford marquee with Statham. 'We were making a presentation,' he recalls. 'And when we walked into the place there was an impromptu standing ovation. It was lovely, absolutely lovely. He may be gone but definitely not forgotten - especially by me.'",

      "body": "<p>At 10.30am last Thursday, the fax in Tony Blair's outer office hummed into life. The Prime Minister's private secretary had been expecting an important delivery from the Foreign Office. And this was it.</p> <p>From the fax came seven pages of neatly typed transcript, the speech the Foreign Secretary was due to deliver to the House of Commons that afternoon. It had arrived 'for comment', Civil Service speak for the fine tooth-comb process which all utterances on Europe have to go through.</p> <p>The sense of expectation was high. That evening the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, was to give his Mansion House speech, the Treasury's key platform before the City. Would Robin Cook, a noted Euro-enthusiast, be able to square his message with Brown, archly cautious on Europe and particularly the single currency? The whiff of split hung heavy in the air.</p> <p>The Government was just about holding the line. Blair had used Thursday morning's Cabinet meeting to make clear that he wanted to see all ministers falling behind the Government line. The Mansion House speech would be the definitive statement on official policy and should not be departed from. His colleagues nodded in agreement. It was an agreement that was not to last beyond that afternoon.</p> <p>Heavy briefing during the week had suggested that Brown was to use his speech to demonstrate that he was in charge of policy in Europe. Simmering resentment among other members of the Cabinet was apparent but had yet to break the surface. But by yesterday any pretence that some of the most powerful politicians in Britain see eye to eye on this country's tactics towards Europe had been abandoned. It is a political story with all the pre-requisites - high drama, clashing personalities and a liberal sprinkling of farce.</p> <p>Cook's speechwriters had, as ever, taken great care over the wording, going through the usual agreed European lexicon on what was allowed.</p> <p>Any reference to joining the single currency had to be preceded with the word 'successful'. Brown's five economic conditions had to be referred to. The referendum and the fact that it was the people who would ultimately decide were also essential.</p> <p>Cook's officials had dutifully written all the elements into the speech. It was faxed to Downing Street with some confidence. They waited for a response. And waited. And waited. The Foreign Secretary was due to stand up in the Commons and start his speech at 1.15pm. As the clock in the Commons chamber ticked towards start time, Cook still had his original speech in front of him. As usual, copies had been circulated to the expectant press gallery sitting above him. Nothing had come back from Downing Street, and Cook believed that his speech had been given the all clear. After all, it contained nothing that he hadn't said before.</p> <p>Just before he got up he was tapped on the shoulder by a colleague and handed a brown envelope. In it was a handwritten note from his private office. Number 10 had been in touch, the note said. Please be aware of the Chancellor's speech this evening, the note said. We do not want to be a hostage to media accusations of splits, the note said. And that was it, no suggestion of which bits to cut or trim, just a warning.</p> <p>Senior government sources said that the lateness of the missive came because of a mistake at Number 10. They assumed that Cook would be speaking after 3pm, the usual time for major debates to start in the Commons.</p> <p>But last week was a 'constituency week', meaning that Parliament closes early to allow MPs time to get back to their seats. The early closure means that all debates are brought forward.</p> <p>As he rose to his feet and with his original speech in front of him, Cook knew he would have to think quickly. He hadn't even seen the Mansion House speech. How was Cook to know what might sound like a split? He desperately scanned forward through his words, deciding to cut any sections that could be picked upon as being too Euro-enthusiast.</p> <p>On page 2, half way down, came the line: 'At that point [2002] Britain could be the only member state outside the euro zone.' Cook skipped it.</p> <p>On page 3, near the top. 'If our economic conditions are met, it would be right in principle for Britain to join - and wrong in principle to rule it out. This Government will not let Britain lose out by staying out.' Cook skipped it.</p> <p>On page 4, again near the top. 'The breaking down of the Berlin Wall removed the political barriers that divided Europe for half a century. Including the new democracies into the European Union will remove the economic barriers that still divide them. Enlargement will be the completion of the European Union.' Cook skipped it.</p> <p>As he left the Commons chamber later that afternoon, he felt pleased with his performance, noting that nothing he had said in the chamber could be used against either him or the Government.</p> <p>But he had forgotten about the stack of copies of his original speech left in the press gallery. Journalists had noted the sections he had dropped and had put two and two together. By the mid-afternoon editions of the London Evening Standard it was running as a row story.</p> <p>It could still have been contained. Cook's officials agreed that if asked about why the Foreign Secretary had dropped significant parts of his speech they would cite interruptions from the Opposition benches.</p> <p>But the excuse didn't wash, particularly to those well versed in the arcane procedures of Parliament. Government ministers are not obliged to give way to interjections from the Opposition benches but Cook did so regularly. One observer pointed out that it might have been a deliberate ploy to give himself more time to think about how to handle his speech.</p> <p>The Treasury saw an opportunity. Political reporters were briefed that, far from Cook making the decision on which sections to drop, it was Brown who had ordered the changes. Cook had been slapped down and the Chancellor had once again revealed that it was him, and him alone, that was in charge of policy on the single currency.</p> <p>The next day the headlines said it all. Cook had been humiliated, appearing little more than a bag carrier for Brown. The Foreign Secretary was furious and let it be known that, far from remaining quiet on Europe, he would speak regularly on the issue in the coming weeks.</p> <p>'We have now got ourselves in the ludicrous situation where anything Robin says on the issue of Europe will be seen as a challenge to Gordon's authority,' said one senior government source. 'How the hell did we get into that position? Well, the Treasury have made a rod for their own back.'</p> <p>Cook made his own feelings perfectly clear when, in his one public comment on the issue on Friday, he said: 'The statement that this Government will not let Britain lose out by staying out of the euro is some thing I have said half a dozen times and I will say it again.' The 'losing out by staying out' line is the one he dropped from his original speech and the key phrase that irritates the Treasury.</p> <p>By Friday, the Treasury was playing down its attack on Cook insisting there was no split. Government officials said over the weekend that members of the Cabinet - Cook, Peter Mandelson and Stephen Byers - want to make the case for the euro now, fearing that if it is left too late public opinion, overwhelmingly against the single currency, will never be turned around.</p> <p>The two competing messages have left the Government's line to flip flop in an alarming manner.</p> <p>It began in April when Peter Mandelson made a speech extolling the virtues of the euro. The Treasury immediately briefed journalists that they were amazed that the Northern Ireland secretary saw fit to comment on an issue clearly outside his remit.</p> <p>A month later, refusing to be cowed, Mandelson spoke out again, this time in front of an audience of GMB manufacturing union delegates in Belfast. Brown, who had not even seen the speech, was particularly angry.</p> <p>Brown told Blair that all speeches on the euro had in future to be cleared by him. The Prime Minister agreed. But the issue refused to go away as Stephen Byers, the Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry, in a series of interviews and appearances in the Commons, made clear his own enthusiasm for the euro project.</p> <p>And then came this week's debacle. On Sunday afternoon, at a briefing to key political journalists, it was made clear that Brown was in charge of euro policy.</p> <p>But the following day Blair revealed his own hand when, in an article jointly written with Spain's Prime Minister, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, he spoke warmly about the successes of the euro. It was placed in the Financial Times to ensure the message was read across Europe. The one person who Brown can't tell what to do on the euro is the Prime Minister.</p> <p>But just as the debate appeared to be swinging away from the Chancellor there came an important interjection. Eddie George, the Governor of the Bank of England, dismissed accusations that the City would suffer if Britain delayed joining the euro. The Treasury was delighted.</p> <p>Some senior Downing Street strategists are becoming increasingly concerned at Brown's insistence on taking the lead. Number 10 is worried that Brown's more cautious line will create future political problems. If Blair calls a referendum his political life will depend on the outcome.</p> <p>So the Government is caught between two stools. On Friday afternoon, in the fetid atmosphere of the Downing Street press lobby room, Alastair Campbell, the Prime Minister's official spokesman, arrived with his usual cup of tea in a Burnley FC mug. With him was John Kingman, chief press secretary to Brown, and representatives from the Foreign Office and the Cabinet Office. It was an obvious show of unity but it revealed the ridiculous position the Government now finds itself in.</p> <p>This afternoon Cook, Brown and Blair travel to Feira in Portugal for the final summit of the Portuguese presidency of the European Union. Cook and Blair will travel on one plane and will attend the socialist leader's dinner this evening. Brown will travel separately, needing to arrive at a different time because of the Ecofin meeting of European finance ministers.</p> <p>'There will be journalists everywhere and Robin will be constantly asked about the euro and he'll talk about it,' said a government source.

      "body": "<p>It was almost 10 years ago. I was producing films and documentaries for Bandung Productions and Channel 4 was still interested in ideas. I suggested four films on philosophy, chamber epics constructed around the lives and ideas of Socrates, Spinoza, Locke and Wittgenstein. </p> <p>They agreed to four scripts on the spot, alerting me to the fact that budgets were small and that I could not exceed \u00a3200,000 per film. By the time all the other scripts were written and approved, we had already filmed Spinoza with Henry Goodman in the title role, but the commissioning editor had moved on. His successor was also enthusiastic but, for some reason, not keen on Socrates and so the old Greek fell by the wayside. They asked who was going to direct Wittgenstein? I was still thinking. Spinoza had been beautifully filmed by Chris Spencer but the style was naturalistic. Wittgenstein needed to be different, slightly surreal. </p> <p>On an impulse I rang Derek Jarman in Dungeness. I had never met him before, but had greatly admired two of his films - Caravaggio and Edward II - from afar. After speaking to him that morning I went out and bought a copy of Modern Nature from the Owl Bookshop on Kentish Town Road. I read it in the office for the rest of the day and finished it the next morning. To my great surprise I enjoyed it enormously. He was much more than a film-maker or a gay saint. </p> <p>I know the date I made the call, because Jarman recorded it in his diary. It was 19 May, 1992. His enthusiasm surprised me. He told me that he had always wanted to make a film on the philosopher, but had never got beyond the title - 'Loony Ludwig'. I sent him Terry Eagleton's script, which was definitely not 'Loony Ludwig'. </p> <p>He read it and rang me back the next day. He liked it and wanted to make the film. A week later I drove to Dungeness and found Prospect Cottage by the sea. The garden was, as had been claimed by every visitor, a work of art, but my enjoyment was restrained by the knowledge that we were overlooked by a giant nuclear reactor. It was then that his illness really hit me. </p> <p>Nobody else I know would deliberately choose to live so close to a nuclear reactor. Derek no longer cared. Aids would carry him off sooner rather than later and he enjoyed living on the edge. He grinned as he told me that it was so lovely to swim on a deserted beach. 'In the summer I often run out of the cottage naked and straight into the sea. It's radioactive all right. Friends have tested it with Geiger counters. Sometimes the reactor ODs and the whole place lights up. It's really sensational. You know what I mean?' I did. </p> <p>We spent most of the day discussing Wittgenstein. He knew exactly what he wanted. No Merchant-Ivory nonsense. No English Heritage atrocities. Apart from aesthetics we simply did not have the money to make that sort of a film. It must be austere in keeping with the philosophy. Wittgenstein would record his life in front of black drapes straight into the camera. As he notes in his forthcoming diaries, Smiling in Slow Motion: 'The visualisation must mirror the work - no competition from objects.' He was sure he would make it work. He asked which of his films I had seen and liked. I named them. He laughed. </p> <p>After a pause I confessed that Sebastianne (the film based around Saint Sebastian that established Jarman as a gay director) had, alas, not succeeded in keeping me awake. It was sweet lemonade, whereas Caravaggio and Edward II were much stronger stuff. </p> <p>'Why did you make Sebastianne ?' I asked him. The reply was instant. 'There was only one real reason. To show a hard-on on the screen.' </p> <p>We discussed production details and it was the only time on that occasion he mentioned his illness. 'You'd better put an extra director in the budget. The insurers will insist on it. His name is Ken Butler and he shot the best two scenes in Edward II when I had to go into hospital.' </p> <p>He looked so well that day that it was difficult to imagine him in hospital. As I was about to leave, I suggested to him that with Wittgenstein he should shock his fans. </p> <p>'What do you mean? What do you mean?' </p> <p>'Not a single bum or willy. Let the audience have withdrawal symptoms.' </p> <p>He laughed. 'It's a deal. It'll make a change.' </p> <p>And so it came about that the only sex in Wittgenstein is one fairly chaste kiss on the lips exchanged between Wittgenstein and Johnnie. Today the controllers of our TV channels would insist on maximum exposure. </p> <p>We talked on the phone over the next few days and then I returned to Dungeness, this time by train. We went, as he records, to have lunch in the pub at Lydd and talked about everything. There was no God, there were no ghosts. He was prepared for blindness and death. It did not frighten him. He said something which has always stayed with me: 'If you want nothing, hope for nothing and fear nothing, you can never be an artist.' </p> <p>He hated the monarchy and savaged the honours system. He was very angry with Ian McKellen for accepting a knighthood and entering 10 Downing Street. I was amused, but not in the least surprised to note the following entry quoted in his diary. This is the voice I remember so well: 'Vivienne Westwood accepts an OBE, dipsy bitch. The silly season's with us: our punk friends accept their little medals of betrayal, sit in their vacuous salons and destroy the creative - like the woodworm in my dresser, which I will paint with insecticide tomorrow. I would love to place a man-sized insectocutor, lit with royal-blue, to burn up this clothes-moth and her like.' </p> <p>I had seen a reference in Modern Nature (a book which contained Derek's reflections on natural history as well as his own and was so well-constructed that a Belgian producer actually staged it in 1993) to a trip he made to Pakistan, and questioned him. It emerged that his father had been a senior air-force officer in India and had been seconded to help establish the Pakistan Air Force after independence in 1947. Throughout the Fifties, Derek had spent part of the summer holidays in the Himalayan foothills in northern Pakistan. The Air Force had a special holiday resort in Kalabagh, two miles north of Nathiagali, where my family spent every summer to escape the heat of the plains. </p> <p>Those were idyllic months. As teenagers we climbed mountains, went for 20-mile walks, played tennis, mooned constantly over the girls, trying desperately to draw them into our fantasies. There was a freedom in the mountains untouched in those days by urban inhibitions. The thought that a young Jarman had only been a few miles away amused both of us. He had not discovered his sexuality at the time and roared when I told him that homosexuality in that part of Pakistan was very pronounced. The more snobby locals traced it back to the Greek generals and soldiers left behind after Alexander's conquests. 'If you had shown the slightest interest, Derek,' I told him, 'there would have been a queue outside your cottage.' </p> <p>As we began preparations to film Wittgenstein he moved into the Bandung offices in Kentish Town, with Ken Butler at his side. Scripts were rewritten, actors auditioned. There was always a very special place in his heart for Tilda Swinton. 'If only she'd been a boy,' he would mutter. </p> <p>Those were joyous days. We were short of money. The BFI helped out, but not enough. Derek was enraged. 'They've just given X a million and we can't even get a few hundred thousand.' </p> <p>He asked me to telephone a Japanese producer who was 'always good for \u00a350,000 or so'. Takashi did not let us down. Still, there wasn't enough to make a film that could be shown on the big screen. In order to make it happen, people worked virtually for free. </p> <p>During filming, we were all amazed. Derek's energy was staggering. He drew on all his reserves and worked 12-hour days for two whole weeks. Ken Butler was not needed in the end, though his presence cheered us all. Throughout this period, Arif, Bandung's in-house cameraman, recorded Derek at work. There are 15 hours of tape and I watched some for the first time before writing this to refresh my memory: the zest for life dominates. </p> <p>After the film was finished we stayed in touch. I went to the preview of Blue , Derek's film tribute to the painter Yves Klein, laughing to myself as sundry celebrities whispered to each other in bewilderment. They couldn't believe that all they would see was a blue screen with a voiceover. Over lunch at a greasy-spoon Chinese in Soho's Lisle Street he discussed The Raft of the Medusa . He wanted to make a film based on the Gericault painting. It would be a film about death. The people on the raft as Aids victims. He wanted me to get a commission. I rang George Faber at the BBC who commissioned it without any delay. A script was begun. We used to meet and talk. A new biography of J. Edgar Hoover had just appeared which revealed that he had always been a homosexual and a secret transvestite. We laughed and laughed. I suggested that The Raft might take a surreal turn. We should have a limo surrounded by G-men entering the studio and Hoover in a stunning red dress steps out and orders his cops to arrest the director. I suggested it might lighten the mood. </p> <p>Some months later I got a letter from the St Petersburg Film Festival. They wanted to show Wittgenstein and were inviting Derek and me to introduce the film. I informed them that he was dead and I did not wish to travel alone. </p> <p>\u0095 Smiling in Slow Motion by Derek Jarman is published by Century (\u00a316.99) on 6 July.

Holding her four-month-old baby, Esme, in one arm, she organises a bottle of milk with her agent, this evening's babysitter. 'I'll blast the bottle in the microwave, shall I?' asks her agent. 'No. Heat it up in some warm water,' says Samantha Morton. </p> <p>I've arranged to spend an evening in the company of Samantha Morton, currently starring in Woody Allen's new movie, Sweet and Lowdown, opposite Sean Penn. 'Samantha would like to go out and do something different,' her agent had purred a few days earlier. What about a gig, I suggested. Rap band Public Enemy? Monday? The agent agreed: 'That sounds great. We'll have a car take you.' </p> <p>On Monday morning, the schedule changes. 'Samantha would like to meet at a pub near her house,' announces the agent, hinting at a non-negotiable contract. 'Can you be there for half-seven?' I agree. The telephone rings again at nearly 5pm: 'Er, Sam wants to do something else now. One of her friends is appearing at Rada. Can you get here for 6.15?' </p> <p>I turn up at the house, scowling wildly. But as I sit swilling my tea in the kitchen, it's hard not to feel admiration for her. Juggling her child from arm to arm, she apologises for the change of venue. 'I feel so guilty. I'm really sorry about doing this. Ordinarily, I'd love to see Public Enemy.' </p> <p>I have spotted Morton's work over the years; certainly she triggers strong memories. In the canon of young British actresses, she has few contemporaries who can match her range and aesthetic individuality. Her breakthrough was a 1994 episode of Cracker, in which she played a confused schoolgirl who is seduced and later killed. It led to a variety of similarly disturbing roles: in 1995, she played an out- of-control teenage prostitute in the ITV drama Band of Gold. The critically acclaimed performance was followed by her much-lauded turn in Carine Adler's searing film Under the Skin as Iris, whose grief over her mother's death pushes her into a hellish spiral of self-abuse and promiscuity. </p> <p>She has also hinted at a deeper variety in her repertoire along the way: in 1997, she took the lead role in the TV film Jane Eyre. And that same year, she beguiled viewers as Sofia, the feisty heroine from the TV series Tom Jones. </p> <p>This month and next, she has two feature films on release: Sweet and Lowdown and the indie drugs movie Jesus' Son, in which she plays the confused girlfriend of local loser Billy Crudup. Directed by Allison Maclean (Crush), Morton's performance is bound to elevate her rank alongside that of popular American alternative actresses like Chlo\u00eb Sevigny. </p> <p>Both are intoxicating films and Morton, still only 22, excels at both performances with her little witticisms and characteristic vulnerability. She is, she makes a point of telling me later, painstakingly dedicated to acting. 'I'm very lucky - I get lots of parts offered to me. A few scripts every week. But I am choosy, otherwise I'd last only a year in this business.' </p> <p>Her rise through the ranks of British actresses has been remarkable. Her parents, Pamela and Peter Morton, were evicted from their Nottingham council home as their marriage broke down. Her father moved Samantha, her sister and brother in with 15-year-old neighbour Jane Waplington, whom he later married after making her pregnant. After several instances of neglect, the children were taken into care - Samantha was sent to various children's institutions and foster homes. At 13, she joined the Central Television workshop for young people, moving to London at the age of 16 and becoming a regular at the Royal Court. </p> <p>Later, she will fleetingly describe her life in care - which she has, until now, tried to avoid talking about. 'I don't want to moan about it; lots of other kids go through care. It gives you a special kind of confidence,' she says. 'You instinctively want to make the best of everything, work harder than everyone else. Success drives you. And then there's that special pride when you achieve something.' </p> <p>It's an extraordinary circumstance she finds herself in. Last year, while she was only 21, Woody Allen, after being handed a video of Under the Skin, personally lobbied her for the role of a mute in Sweet and Lowdown. But the experience of working with Allen, she says, left her strangely dislocated. 'He doesn't give you much direction, not that it was much of a problem. But he's not the kind of person who throws huge tantrums to get what he wants. And if you're looking for praise from him, there's none of that either. You come in, give out your lines, and that's it. You can't impress him - he's seen it all before.' </p> <p>She had a similarly unaffected relationship with her co-star, Sean Penn. 'He's not the hard-drinking womaniser he once was,' says Morton. 'So I never saw him off the set. We'd work together - and he'd go back to his family. He's incredibly professional, of course, but detached from his co-stars.' </p> <p>On the way to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, at its temporary home near the Oval, Morton rolls down the window. She peers up at the passing buildings, inspects herself for blemishes in the passenger-side mirror, then turns around to glare at me. 'I never got into Rada,' she says. 'I was too fucking shit for them.' Then she backtracks: 'But I wouldn't have wanted to go anyway - they have this habit of remaking everyone in their own image of an actor.' She sighs. </p> <p>The mini-cab driver pulls into Rada's car park. 'Can you turn up that song a bit?' she asks. The driver fiddles with the volume control, and Morton starts swaying to a recent hit by pop group Moloko. 'I love this song,' she says. 'Don't you just love it?' </p> <p>We walk up the ramp, and into the network of studios. As I stand nearby, watching her interact with friends, she periodically introduces me. Later, she will be scolded for screaming with delight on spotting an old friend from Nottingham, Charlene. 'Please, could you keep it down,' cautions an attendant. 'We have performances going on here.' </p> <p>The play, The Accrington Pals, is a grisly drama set in Lancashire against the backdrop of the First World War. A group of twentysomething men has enlisted to fight at the Battle of the Somme. The play re-enacts the ruination of the conscripts in the trenches, and the skewed anxieties of the women back home. As amateur productions go, it demands rigorous attention - several audience members can be heard sniffling back tears. </p> <p>In one scene, a male lead shuffles into the darkened studio, dragging a quarter-filled tin bathtub behind him. As the lights go on, he is discovered to be naked. Emulating a Norman Wisdom routine, he waves his penis only feet away from the audience. 'Booger, booger, booger,' he cries, then settles into the bathtub. Horrified, I plunge my face into my hands. Morton, however, stares wide-eyed at the actor, screaming her approval: 'Waah-hah! Waah-hah! Waah-hah!' It's the most gloriously disorderly moment during the whole performance. </p> <p>You didn't tell me that was going to happen, I tell her during the break. Scots are incredibly prudish about nudity, I continue, we're normally found wilting beneath blankets and puffa jackets, even on the beach. Morton laughs. She's wandered back from the ad-hoc Rada canteen, her tray laden with two coffees, a slice of caramel biscuit, one Danish pastry and two sets of sandwiches. 'Well, I didn't know that was going to happen, did I?' she says. 'But I'm glad - something was needed to break up the seriousness.' </p> <p>Scoffing down a sandwich, she's only slurped a few mouthfuls of coffee when the interval ends. 'What am I going to do?' squeals Morton, her arms scooping up her food. 'I've fucking bought loads of stuff.' She leaves everything with a member of the counter staff; her friend Charlene smuggles in the caramel biscuit. 'Needs some school-canteen custard,' she says, offering me a corner. 'Old-fashioned custard: you can't beat it.' </p> <p>After the play, Morton, Charlene, her old drama teacher and a few friends head off to a local pub. Morton had left the building hurriedly. 'I've got to fart,' she'd announced. 'It's been bottled up inside since the beginning.' </p> <p>Morton has hardly said a word about herself all evening, leaving me to draw my own conclusions ever since the taxi ride. Trailing behind the pub-goers with me, Morton says, 'You must have wondered why I was laughing so loudly during that performance.' You didn't guffaw at any moment that could have been deemed inappropriate, I say. 'Yes, but I was only laughing loudly because I was so upset,' she says. 'That was incredibly moving.' </p> <p>She pauses, that unblinking gaze seeking an explanation, perhaps even validation. I refuse to budge. Seconds later, as if to contextualise her screams of laughter in the studio, she admits offence at the dramatic gimmickry used by mainstream directors to illustrate the terrors of war. She says, 'I thought Schindler's List was like war as pornography. That girl singled out in the red dress, when the rest of the film was in black and white? Everyone knows the Holocaust was a horrible thing: why single out one incident?' </p> <p>It's around here that I remind myself that she's still only 22 - a virtuoso actress still precocious about her fame. Throughout the evening, friends - old and new - have been showering her with praise for Sweet and Lowdown. And Morton is intractably self-effacing when faced with her glories. 'So what are you doing?', 'I loved your performance in that play' and 'I'm so proud of you' are all the defensive rebuttals of a blushing student whose promotion to head girl has just been broadcast over the school Tannoy. </p> <p>'I am proud of what I've done,' she blurts. We're only doors away from the pub. Fiddling with her hair, she pulls her sweat-top around herself. 'You might think that's kind of impolite, maybe even a little rude. But, yes, I have achieved a lot. And I am proud of it. I look at my friends, these friends, and they're still starting out. I am years ahead of them; I worked hard for it.' </p> <p>In the pub, Morton skips over to the bar and buys a drink for me, as well as a pint of Guinness for herself. 'I want to stay out all night now, but I can't,' she whispers. 'I've got Esme to think about.' Morton is currently estranged from actor-boyfriend Charlie Creed-Miles, the child's father. She looks mournfully at her friends - all undergraduates unburdened by responsibility. 'The films are good,' she says. 'But I get no time for my daughter. I'm going to take next year off.' </p> <p>The conversation drifts to Morton's appearance at the Oscar Awards ceremony in March: 'My stylist had a fit, and I looked like a hooker gatecrashing the party.' And her infamous garb at last summer's garden party at Buckingham Palace with the Queen - the tabloids had delighted in ridiculing her for wearing flip-flops. 'The Queen's a right stuffy cow,' says Morton. 'She got right up me from the minute I got in there.' She lapses into a vivid impersonation of the royal inflection: 'And wot doo yoo doo?' Her friends, crowding in on every word, listen and laugh cordially. 'It all sounds amazing,' breathes Charlene. And as she holds court, Morton asks her friends to visit her soon. 'Are you sure I can call you?' asks one. 'Are you sure?' </p> <p>I sit at the edge of the table, observing this ancient ritual: a reunion of teenage friends. Morton takes a gulp of Guinness, then laughs. 'Oh my God, you haven't even interviewed me yet.' It's a little past 11pm, and my tape recorder is lying idly beneath her chair. 'You've had that on the whole time,' she says, accusingly. </p> <p>The wheels haven't moved all night, I say. 'But you've not even asked one question yet!' screams Morton, her familiar throaty laugh echoing around the pub. Charlene giggles: 'He hasn't asked you a question yet!' Says Morton: 'What kind of interviewer are you?' I ask her: When have you given me the chance to get a word in edgeways? </p> <p>'Oh my God!' she yells. 'You're right. OK, how do we do this, then?' She makes me call her a car. 'We can do the interview in the car, then.' Charlene giggles: 'Samantha, you haven't changed at all. Not one bit.' </p> <p>Later, sitting in her flat, the clock approaching midnight, and watching her stir what she describes as 'builders' tea', I start to quantify her ambitions. Still in her early twenties, Morton exudes the kind of theatrical appetite normally found in the sweaty pigpen of politics. 'I want to let you into my life,' she had said in the car, on the way back from Rada. 'Spending time with me and my friends means you get to see what I'm about. I want to let you watch me in a normal situation.' </p> <p>I initially thought it a naive but laudable notion: The Interviewer ravished with access to His Subject. Only, Morton has engineered all the proceedings herself: discreetly overwhelming all situations before her, then mocking my submissive silence. Merely watching her hop around a room, gladhanding her friends, is tiring work. </p> <p>Still, she possesses a little of the coy but eager politeness indicative of most twenty-somethings. Moving around her kitchen, where belongings sit unpacked in boxes, she asks me if I'm hungry. 'Want some of this?' she asks, offering a bowl of grilled cashew nuts. I decline politely, holding on to my tea. She says, 'What about some lemon biscuits?' </p> <p>Her gaze is unflinching, and makes me look away. 'I'm just anticipating the next question,' she says, softly. To promote her latest film, her press officer lobbied for an appearance on TFI Friday, leaving '15 messages' on Chris Evans's answering machine. 'But he never got back to us,' says Morton. She looks hurt. Does a non-appearance on TFI Friday bother her that much? 'Yes. Maybe I don't look like one of the leggy blondes that he normally has on,' she says. 'But I'm sure the audience would have wanted to know me. I would have made sure I had a good time. And it would have been nice for his audience to have someone as different as me on the show.' </p> <p>She is, she says, periodically perturbed by her appearance. For example, she is currently fixated with the size of her breasts. 'I'm breast-feeding my baby at the moment,' she says. 'They're huge.' She sits up straight at the table, thrusting her breast out in the exaggerated femininity of Monroe. 'Men can't keep their eyes off of them. Look! They're bloody huge.' And she talks about her impish mouth, her limbs that flail like someone attempting underwater gymnastics for the first time. 'I'll never get a part in a huge action blockbuster,' Morton says. 'I'm not a purist - I'd do it. I'm sure those films can be fun. There's a place for them in cinema.' </p> <p>She continues: 'Everyone wants to look their best, everyone has dreams of wanting to look like something else. But we are who we are. I saw Minnie Driver at the Oscars, and it made me sad. She's just so thin, and she's bought into the whole Hollywood mystique.' </p> <p>She admits, however, that if it wasn't for Esme, she would consider relocating to the US - particularly to New York. 'They don't envy success there, y'know? Here, I was nominated for an Oscar, and it's done little for my career. I thought it would have opened up new possibilities. People are just too quick to take a knock at you. No one likes a success here - no one wants you to be proud of your achievements.' </p> <p>The tabloids, in particular, give her a hard time: revisiting old family feuds, poking fun at her unorthodox upbringing and sniggering at her early successes. 'It does bother me,' she says. 'They go and speak to people who know me from when I was in care: that's a deeply personal thing to do. But my friends don't say a word; they never have. Other people do, and I get angry. It's my fucking life, y'know. Leave my family alone.' Morton gets up from the sofa, and slides over to a dusty tape player near the fireplace. As a teenager, she ended up with her brother's old hip-hop albums. 'Do you like Digital Underground?' she asks. 'I listen to all kinds of music, but I do love rap. When you've been raised in care, rap music isn't just about guns and sexism. They're talking about real things you can hang on to, problems of identity that you have sympathy with. It's not just about the music, with rap: when I was in care, it meant a whole lot more than that.' </p> <p>It's almost 12.30am, and I'm still clutching the now-lukewarm cup of tea she's prepared. Morton is talking about herself in the informal, Gen-X way that makes me less an interviewer, more a sounding board. 'This is a bit like therapy - I feel like I should be confessing to all kinds of things,' she pronounces, munching on another lemon biscuit. </p> <p>I think of all the characters she's played throughout her career - scorned and abused women who show unexpected moments of redemption. And here she is, so eager to please. This kind of confessional undertaking must be unique to overachieving actresses, I decide. Musicians, sports stars and politicians rarely display such candour. </p> <p>But I'm still vaguely aware that Morton is steering the interview. She has yet to relinquish control. The friends are hers; the music is her favourite; in the theatre, she's on familiar territory. </p> <p>'I'm really tired,' she says suddenly, stretching back and yawning. She grabs a sandal-shaped phone and calls me a taxi. 'Would you like some more tea before you go?' I politely decline. At the front door, she reaches out for a polite peck on the cheek, and this 22-year-old, ultra-confident mother says she enjoyed the evening out. 'Send me the piece,' she whispers, before closing the door. </p> <p>I leave the doorstep and walk towards the waiting taxi. On the way home, I reconsider the burning ambition Morton leaves in her wake. Acting must be like plastic surgery: you build, mould and sculpt. Still, you're never completely happy. </p> <p>\u0095 Jesus' Son opens on 7 July</p>",

Holding her four-month-old baby, Esme, in one arm, she organises a bottle of milk with her agent, this evening's babysitter. 'I'll blast the bottle in the microwave, shall I?' asks her agent. 'No. Heat it up in some warm water,' says Samantha Morton. I've arranged to spend an evening in the company of Samantha Morton, currently starring in Woody Allen's new movie, Sweet and Lowdown, opposite Sean Penn. 'Samantha would like to go out and do something different,' her agent had purred a few days earlier. What about a gig, I suggested. Rap band Public Enemy? Monday? The agent agreed: 'That sounds great. We'll have a car take you.' On Monday morning, the schedule changes. 'Samantha would like to meet at a pub near her house,' announces the agent, hinting at a non-negotiable contract. 'Can you be there for half-seven?' I agree. The telephone rings again at nearly 5pm: 'Er, Sam wants to do something else now. One of her friends is appearing at Rada. Can you get here for 6.15?' I turn up at the house, scowling wildly.

She is, she says, periodically perturbed by her appearance. For example, she is currently fixated with the size of her breasts. 'I'm breast-feeding my baby at the moment,' she says. 'They're huge.' She sits up straight at the table, thrusting her breast out in the exaggerated femininity of Monroe. 'Men can't keep their eyes off of them. Look! They're bloody huge.' And she talks about her impish mouth, her limbs that flail like someone attempting underwater gymnastics for the first time. 'I'll never get a part in a huge action blockbuster,' Morton says. 'I'm not a purist - I'd do it. I'm sure those films can be fun. There's a place for them in cinema.' She continues: 'Everyone wants to look their best, everyone has dreams of wanting to look like something else. But we are who we are. I saw Minnie Driver at the Oscars, and it made me sad. She's just so thin, and she's bought into the whole Hollywood mystique.' She admits, however, that if it wasn't for Esme, she would consider relocating to the US - particularly to New York. 'They don't envy success there, y'know? Here, I was nominated for an Oscar, and it's done little for my career. I thought it would have opened up new possibilities. People are just too quick to take a knock at you. No one likes a success here - no one wants you to be proud of your achievements.' The tabloids, in particular, give her a hard time: revisiting old family feuds, poking fun at her unorthodox upbringing and sniggering at her early successes. 'It does bother me,' she says. 'They go and speak to people who know me from when I was in care: that's a deeply personal thing to do. But my friends don't say a word; they never have. Other people do, and I get angry. It's my fucking life, y'know. Leave my family alone.' Morton gets up from the sofa, and slides over to a dusty tape player near the fireplace. As a teenager, she ended up with her brother's old hip-hop albums. 'Do you like Digital Underground?' she asks. 'I listen to all kinds of music, but I do love rap. When you've been raised in care, rap music isn't just about guns and sexism. They're talking about real things you can hang on to, problems of identity that you have sympathy with. It's not just about the music, with rap: when I was in care, it meant a whole lot more than that.' It's almost 12.30am, and I'm still clutching the now-lukewarm cup of tea she's prepared. Morton is talking about herself in the informal, Gen-X way that makes me less an interviewer, more a sounding board. 'This is a bit like therapy - I feel like I should be confessing to all kinds of things,' she pronounces, munching on another lemon biscuit. I think of all the characters she's played throughout her career - scorned and abused women who show unexpected moments of redemption. And here she is, so eager to please. This kind of confessional undertaking must be unique to overachieving actresses, I decide. Musicians, sports stars and politicians rarely display such candour. But I'm still vaguely aware that Morton is steering the interview. She has yet to relinquish control. The friends are hers; the music is her favourite; in the theatre, she's on familiar territory. 'I'm really tired,' she says suddenly, stretching back and yawning. She grabs a sandal-shaped phone and calls me a taxi. 'Would you like some more tea before you go?' I politely decline. At the front door, she reaches out for a polite peck on the cheek, and this 22-year-old, ultra-confident mother says she enjoyed the evening out. 'Send me the piece,' she whispers, before closing the door. I leave the doorstep and walk towards the waiting taxi. On the way home, I reconsider the burning ambition Morton leaves in her wake. Acting must be like plastic surgery: you build, mould and sculpt. Still, you're never completely happy. \u0095 Jesus' Son opens on 7 July",

Even the most resourceful publishing PR would be struggling to gush over a precis that might read: 'An Indian lecturer in economics at an American university, recently separated from his wife, returns home to Calcutta for a few weeks' holiday with his son; he stays with his parents, who are retired.'</p> <p>Chaudhuri's previous books, recently collected in one volume as A Freedom Song, were similarly lacking in potential for hype: 'Schoolboy from Bombay details his holiday in Calcutta'; 'Indian student at Oxford muses on his casual desire for fellow undergraduates'; 'Calcutta family fails to put on a play'.</p> <p>In his first novel, A Strange and Sublime Address, his young narrator imagined writing a story about his impressions of his city, but feared that 'the story would never be a satisfying one, because the writer, like Sandeep, would be too caught up jotting down the irrelevancies and digressions that make up lives, and the life of a city, rather than a good story - till the reader would shout, \"Come to the point\".'</p> <p>In this 'jotting of irrelevancies and digressions' and in his refusal to 'come to the point' lie the pleasures of Chaudhuri's writing: the absolute clarity of his phrasing, the perfectly mimicked rhythm of a conversation, the careful placing of a verb or a comma and, above all, his spare and truthful rendering of the subtle mechanics of close human relationships.</p> <p>To some extent, all of Chaudhuri's characters are dangling men, caught between worlds and between lives. Jayojit, the economist in A New World, arrives in Calcutta already at one remove from his existence. His wife of 11 years has left him (in favour, we later learn, of her gynaecologist) and he 'hadn't felt desire in a long time'; when their son, Bonny, had been born, 'there had been a cutting off of sexuality' and it hasn't returned.</p> <p>If Jayojit feels inured to his body, he reinforces that disjunction by refusing to immerse himself in his native city's more corporeal pleasures: he is not ready to take on Calcutta's food - he is careful about what his mother is feeding him; won't buy from the street vendors; checks that his water is boiled - or its traffic; he walks rather than risk a car. And he keeps himself brand-name clean by going into a chemist to order his Colgate toothpaste and his Dove soap and his Pond's talc.</p> <p>The closest he gets to real interaction with Calcutta are the little trips he makes to the bank where he quietly imagines flirtations with the tellers. Otherwise, the city's teeming voices are like the sound of televisions from neighbouring flats, a 'form of public dreaming'.</p> <p>And if Jayojit no longer feels at home in India, he also is estranged from his adoptive America. When he thinks of his life there, what comes to mind is wandering the aisles of a chill supermarket hoping to bump into an acquaintance. Though he hardly begins to acknowledge it, all the ties that once bound him to an identity are thus broken or frayed, and the novel charts his minute progress in trying to re-establish a workable sense of himself.</p> <p>To this end, Chaudhuri employs sentences to capture the fragile syntax that might hold a life together. The many minor dislocations that attend Jayojit's homecoming, for example, are cast in stubborn elbows of clauses such as that which describes him greeting his mother, who can scarce believe he has made it back: '\"Yes, ma,\" he said jovially, and bent his big body to touch, in one of those awkward but anachronistic gestures that defined his family, her feet.'</p> <p>There is a Bengali habit of fathers calling their sons 'dadu'. Using this colloquial inversion, Chaudhuri examines the insecurities of Jayojit's relationship with his father, a retired naval officer, and with his son, who keeps him human. Neither relationship is a simple one: Jayojit's father is somewhat impoverished in his retirement, and clings to some of the formal grandeur of his old life, while his son is only beginning to come to terms with the fact of his parents' separation. Chaudhuri has always written with acuity about children, and he brings to life the tenderness and mutual dependency of Jayojit's relationship with his son through pure physical observation.</p> <p>At times, reading some of these passages, you can be reminded of reading Joyce's Dubliners for the first time, where every sentence can seem a small act of beauty. The wider world rarely impinges on these everyday epiphanies. When it does, it is through Jayojit's occasional fretting about his own investments or his father's precarious finances.</p> <p>There was a time when Jayojit's advice had been sought by the government as it prepared liberal economic reforms. For all his understanding of 'global trends' and 'third-world markets', however, Joyojit's macro-economics seems sublimely irrelevant to the minute reality of the new, market-driven economy, the question of whether, as his father wonders, 'it's easier - and cheaper - to have what's-her-name do the washing than to buy a washing-machine', or how his pension might best be invested.</p> <p>But incrementally, such transactions reveal that 'even the - no especially the - free-market economy is held together by tiny rules more subtly graded than the caste system' - and as Chaudhuri teases out some of these 'tiny rules' he offers a glimpse of the ways global changes stealthily affect single marginal lives.</p> <p>In the past, the author has explained how he has adopted a kind of Wordsworthian approach to his writing. If he has an idea for his novel, he does nothing with it for a month or so. 'If the idea still stays,' he says, 'it's worth writing about.' It is perhaps this kind of attentiveness to the quality of emotion that gives the miniaturist dramas he describes their affective force. Browsing in a bookshop at one point, Jayojit weighs in his hands some novels by younger Indian writers: 'They not only look light, they feel lightweight as well,' he says. Don't be fooled.</p>",

If Jayojit feels inured to his body, he reinforces that disjunction by refusing to immerse himself in his native city's more corporeal pleasures: he is not ready to take on Calcutta's food - he is careful about what his mother is feeding him; won't buy from the street vendors; checks that his water is boiled - or its traffic; he walks rather than risk a car. And he keeps himself brand-name clean by going into a chemist to order his Colgate toothpaste and his Dove soap and his Pond's talc. The closest he gets to real interaction with Calcutta are the little trips he makes to the bank where he quietly imagines flirtations with the tellers. Otherwise, the city's teeming voices are like the sound of televisions from neighbouring flats, a 'form of public dreaming'. And if Jayojit no longer feels at home in India, he also is estranged from his adoptive America. When he thinks of his life there, what comes to mind is wandering the aisles of a chill supermarket hoping to bump into an acquaintance. Though he hardly begins to acknowledge it, all the ties that once bound him to an identity are thus broken or frayed, and the novel charts his minute progress in trying to re-establish a workable sense of himself. To this end, Chaudhuri employs sentences to capture the fragile syntax that might hold a life together. The many minor dislocations that attend Jayojit's homecoming, for example, are cast in stubborn elbows of clauses such as that which describes him greeting his mother, who can scarce believe he has made it back: '\"Yes, ma,\" he said jovially, and bent his big body to touch, in one of those awkward but anachronistic gestures that defined his family, her feet.' There is a Bengali habit of fathers calling their sons 'dadu'. Using this colloquial inversion, Chaudhuri examines the insecurities of Jayojit's relationship with his father, a retired naval officer, and with his son, who keeps him human. Neither relationship is a simple one: Jayojit's father is somewhat impoverished in his retirement, and clings to some of the formal grandeur of his old life, while his son is only beginning to come to terms with the fact of his parents' separation. Chaudhuri has always written with acuity about children, and he brings to life the tenderness and mutual dependency of Jayojit's relationship with his son through pure physical observation. At times, reading some of these passages, you can be reminded of reading Joyce's Dubliners for the first time, where every sentence can seem a small act of beauty. The wider world rarely impinges on these everyday epiphanies. When it does, it is through Jayojit's occasional fretting about his own investments or his father's precarious finances. There was a time when Jayojit's advice had been sought by the government as it prepared liberal economic reforms. For all his understanding of 'global trends' and 'third-world markets', however, Joyojit's macro-economics seems sublimely irrelevant to the minute reality of the new, market-driven economy, the question of whether, as his father wonders, 'it's easier - and cheaper - to have what's-her-name do the washing than to buy a washing-machine', or how his pension might best be invested. But incrementally, such transactions reveal that 'even the - no especially the - free-market economy is held together by tiny rules more subtly graded than the caste system' - and as Chaudhuri teases out some of these 'tiny rules' he offers a glimpse of the ways global changes stealthily affect single marginal lives. In the past, the author has explained how he has adopted a kind of Wordsworthian approach to his writing. If he has an idea for his novel, he does nothing with it for a month or so. 'If the idea still stays,' he says, 'it's worth writing about.' It is perhaps this kind of attentiveness to the quality of emotion that gives the miniaturist dramas he describes their affective force. Browsing in a bookshop at one point, Jayojit weighs in his hands some novels by younger Indian writers: 'They not only look light, they feel lightweight as well,' he says. Don't be fooled.",

Before long, Belinda can't bear it. Her soft, helpless fluffiness gives way to shrill recrimination; she refuses to have sex with her husband. All of which makes Mr Fytton feel more than nostalgic about his former wife. Mrs Fytton, meanwhile, is doing what every woman who has ever moved away from London has to do: pickling, preserving and brewing. When she's not pouring vinegar through muslin or steeping wild hops in sugar, she gets to to know the locals, a brilliantly drawn collection of the lustful and the fraudulent. If the major plot-twists of the story sometimes strain at the leash of the believable - character transformations and total reversals of intention were never so glibly arrived at - the supporting cast more than make amends. Mavis Cheek's fiction is entirely amiable; witty, sharp and vivacious. Amy Jenkins, eat your heart out. This is how light romantic fiction is done.",

Her books - Intercourse, Pornography: Men Possessing Women, Life and Death - are confrontational and deliberately shocking. Men still hate women; sex is still inherently violent. It's war, unabated. </p> <p>She has always been a pacifist, but she writes like a warrior, and now in Scapegoat, her new and most radical book yet, she lays aside her pacifism. 'I am an enemy of nationalism and male domination,' she writes in the preface. 'I believe that threatened people and individuals have a right to self-defence... I am a lapsed pacifist, I truly abhor violence and I believe that both nationalism and male domination are systems that promote and produce violence.' </p> <p>This immediate linking of nationalism and misogyny forms the argument of Scapegoat.

The horrors of the gas chambers are more or less equated with some of the obscenities women have suffered through history. </p> <p>The Nazi war against the human body is like men's war against the female body. The pre-Holocaust Jews, explains Dworkin, became known for their suffering and their spirituality. They were intellectual, sensitive, 'feminised'. After the Holocaust, it became imperative to make sure such a thing could never happen again. Jews had to fight back. Women, also equated with suffering and spirituality, also turned into objects, must fight back. </p> <p>Women are the metaphorical Jews. Men are the Nazis. (Even, she admits sadly, Jewish men treat women as badly as anyone else, refusing to be victims by becoming tyrants themselves, thus turning Jewish women into an 'internal exile' in the Promised Land.) </p> <p>Well, it's like Sylvia Plath said in 'Daddy': 'I think I may well be a Jew... I may be a bit of a Jew.' But Sylvia Plath said it in a poem (quoted by Dworkin) about female masochism and despair and rage: 'Every woman adores a fascist,/ The boot in the face, the brute/ Bruteheart of a brute like you.' It's her way of showing the murk and depth of her emotions, Andrea Dworkin says. </p> <p>It is a book crammed with facts, with quotations, with an index and notes that occupy nearly 100 pages, with unblinking, unshrinking descriptions of murder and obscenity through history. She strides across the bloody, Jew-hating, woman-hating century, not just the facts of the Holocaust, but also the infanticide of baby girls in China, bride-burning in Africa, circumcision in Africa, anorexia in the UK and Britain, prostitution and abuse everywhere. </p> <p>She discusses The Merchant of Venice and how it provoked Jewish murder; pornography and how it provokes female objectification and murder. She quotes Will Self, Disraeli, Vita Sackville-West, Amos Oz, linguistic theorists, Nazi diarists. Often the pages bristle with references. It's not metaphor, it's literal. </p> <p>What should we do? she asks (Scapegoat is peppered with questions to the reader.

It's a book that hardly breathes; there are no chinks of light, no room for doubt, no sense of ambivalence, no welcome for ambivalence. </p> <p> Scapegoat 's power - undeniable, robust, fierce and steamrolling - is also its weakness.

Come on, you must be joking. Yet that is exactly what Larry Siedentop provides. Compulsive, because brisk, erudite and full of intellectual fireworks. Thrilling, because he manages to recast the entire European debate, as endlessly rehearsed in slogans and mundane mumblings, and set it in a fresh context. He begins with what he knows best - the constitution James Madison and Alexander Hamilton wrote for the real federal superstate one hot Philadelphia summer 213 years ago. And from that perspective, the US experience, he asks deadly questions about the building of modern Europe. </p> <p>Let's assume that the project is, in fact, about creating a vast federal state, because of the need for peace in this most ancient war zone; that the single market is crucial if you seek to be a big player in a multinational world. None of this, says Siedentop tartly, has any relevance to how that federation can be made to work in cohesive democracy. The confusion of means and ends is complete and potentially fatal. Where, after Adenauer, Spaak and Monnet, are the statesmen of vision who think about what they're creating? We are, alas, in the hands of bricklayers, not master builders. </p> <p>Siedentop does not fear federalism, properly interpreted; indeed, balanced by a written constitution, a senate and other advances, it may be the only way forward for a fiendishly complex union which needs the diversity of its regions to find any human viability, government by consent. What he does fear is the Brussels of today, growing almost heedlessly as an extension of French centralism, a top-down bureaucracy which, in the end, must stifle consent. </p> <p>The French (in his carefully constructed thesis) are the movers and shakers of the Europe we have. Their centralising \u00e9lite was there at the heart of its construction, cajoling along a sheepish Germany; now, propelled by new apprehensions after the Wall came down, it is on the march again. What else is the euro and monetary union but the price that Paris exacted from Bonn for allowing German reunification? What else is the Stability Pact but a French gambit to muster a Mediterranean bloc to counterbalance Berlin, the Hague and Vienna? Why is the next European central banker a Frenchman? French nationalism does not quiver over political integration because it makes the rest of Europe more like France. </p> <p>This isn't another Euro-treatise full of ghosts and villains. It is infinitely more subtle, an examination of frailties rather than a polemic. In spite of all its anxieties about the shape of Brussels to come, it contains nothing of cheer for William Hague. Siedentop is concerned with the quality of democracy, which must underpin any kind of democratic Europe. Britain, he concludes greyly, has nothing of such quality that can currently be exported across the Channel. </p> <p>What made Britain an example to the world through the centuries was not its horror of written constitutions, but the natural balance of institutions - local government, the Church, unions, aristocracy - that curbed an overweening centre. That vanished with the old class system. Thatcher read the last rites for our social liberalism when she discovered market liberalism. In her world, and the world that followed, the law of the markets is absolute. If an economy works then, supposedly, everything works. </p> <p>But even before the WI started heckling, we could see how false that is. People need a sense of identification as citizens, not just consumers. They'll need it more than ever in tomorrow's greater Europe of many surviving cultures and languages. Siedentop doesn't seek to suspend market forces, merely to say they are not enough; not a system of governance or a way of committed life. </p> <p>Britain, before the stirrings of devolution, was out of this game. Prating about diminished 'national sovereignty' is not enough. France has discovered decentralisation, but late in the day. Germany's existing, slightly inert federalism makes it more of a bystander than a player. So what is this ever-expanding union? How will it find its constitutional peace in a time when constitutional change is, supposedly, the scorned preserve of the chattering, discredited classes? What would Madison and Hamilton have made of this pretty pass? </p> <p>In short, Siedentop, a lecturer in political thought at Gordon Brown's unfavourite university, shifts far beyond the narrow trenches of national fear and asks, in the voice of a dispassionate outsider, what are we playing at? What is this project that even the French \u00e9lite cannot explain to its masses for fear of irking the Germans? A secret vision is no vision at all. This is a book for every chancellery across our continent.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Democracy in Europe Larry Seidentop Allen Lane \u00a318.99, pp272 Buy it at BOL A thrilling, compulsively readable book about constitutional reform in the European Union? Come on, you must be joking. Yet that is exactly what Larry Siedentop provides. Compulsive, because brisk, erudite and full of intellectual fireworks. Thrilling, because he manages to recast the entire European debate, as endlessly rehearsed in slogans and mundane mumblings, and set it in a fresh context. He begins with what he knows best - the constitution James Madison and Alexander Hamilton wrote for the real federal superstate one hot Philadelphia summer 213 years ago. And from that perspective, the US experience, he asks deadly questions about the building of modern Europe. Let's assume that the project is, in fact, about creating a vast federal state, because of the need for peace in this most ancient war zone; that the single market is crucial if you seek to be a big player in a multinational world. None of this, says Siedentop tartly, has any relevance to how that federation can be made to work in cohesive democracy. The confusion of means and ends is complete and potentially fatal. Where, after Adenauer, Spaak and Monnet, are the statesmen of vision who think about what they're creating? We are, alas, in the hands of bricklayers, not master builders. Siedentop does not fear federalism, properly interpreted; indeed, balanced by a written constitution, a senate and other advances, it may be the only way forward for a fiendishly complex union which needs the diversity of its regions to find any human viability, government by consent. What he does fear is the Brussels of today, growing almost heedlessly as an extension of French centralism, a top-down bureaucracy which, in the end, must stifle consent. The French (in his carefully constructed thesis) are the movers and shakers of the Europe we have. Their centralising \u00e9lite was there at the heart of its construction, cajoling along a sheepish Germany; now, propelled by new apprehensions after the Wall came down, it is on the march again. What else is the euro and monetary union but the price that Paris exacted from Bonn for allowing German reunification? What else is the Stability Pact but a French gambit to muster a Mediterranean bloc to counterbalance Berlin, the Hague and Vienna? Why is the next European central banker a Frenchman? French nationalism does not quiver over political integration because it makes the rest of Europe more like France. This isn't another Euro-treatise full of ghosts and villains. It is infinitely more subtle, an examination of frailties rather than a polemic. In spite of all its anxieties about the shape of Brussels to come, it contains nothing of cheer for William Hague. Siedentop is concerned with the quality of democracy, which must underpin any kind of democratic Europe. Britain, he concludes greyly, has nothing of such quality that can currently be exported across the Channel. What made Britain an example to the world through the centuries was not its horror of written constitutions, but the natural balance of institutions - local government, the Church, unions, aristocracy - that curbed an overweening centre. That vanished with the old class system. Thatcher read the last rites for our social liberalism when she discovered market liberalism. In her world, and the world that followed, the law of the markets is absolute. If an economy works then, supposedly, everything works. But even before the WI started heckling, we could see how false that is. People need a sense of identification as citizens, not just consumers. They'll need it more than ever in tomorrow's greater Europe of many surviving cultures and languages. Siedentop doesn't seek to suspend market forces, merely to say they are not enough; not a system of governance or a way of committed life. Britain, before the stirrings of devolution, was out of this game. Prating about diminished 'national sovereignty' is not enough. France has discovered decentralisation, but late in the day. Germany's existing, slightly inert federalism makes it more of a bystander than a player. So what is this ever-expanding union? How will it find its constitutional peace in a time when constitutional change is, supposedly, the scorned preserve of the chattering, discredited classes? What would Madison and Hamilton have made of this pretty pass? In short, Siedentop, a lecturer in political thought at Gordon Brown's unfavourite university, shifts far beyond the narrow trenches of national fear and asks, in the voice of a dispassionate outsider, what are we playing at? What is this project that even the French \u00e9lite cannot explain to its masses for fear of irking the Germans? A secret vision is no vision at all. This is a book for every chancellery across our continent.",

      "body": "<p>The troubled saga of blues singer Robert Johnson, poisoned at 29 by the jealous husband of one of his lovers, was reopened last week when a judge ruled that a retired truck driver was his son.</p> <p>Johnson, a towering figure in twentieth century music who helped create the live fast, die young rock'n'roll stereotype, wrote the classic blues standards 'Love in Vain,' 'Hellhound on my Tail' and 'Rambling on My Mind'. He always said he had met the devil on a crossroads one dark Mississippi night and exchanged his soul for his talent.</p> <p>Until last week's ruling by the Mississippi Supreme Court it was believed he had died without an heir. But 63 years after his death in 1938, the court ruled that Claud Johnson, from Crystal Springs, is the flesh-and-blood of a man so steeped in mythology that it is hard to say where the legend ends and the truth begins.</p> <p>After years of legal battles, Claud Johnson should now receive more than $1 million in music royalties.</p> <p>'All my life I have known that he was my father,' said Johnson, whose mother Virgie Jane Smith had an affair with the singer in 1931, resulting in his birth.</p> <p>The musician visited Smith a year before he died. 'We were living in my granddaddy's and grandmama's house,' Johnson said. 'They were religious people, and they thought that the blues was the devil's music. People back then believed that.</p> <p>'They told my daddy they didn't want no part of him. They said he was working for the devil. They wouldn't even let me go out and touch him. I stood in the door, and he stood on the ground, and that is as close as I ever got to him. Finally, he said, \"Well, I might as well go.\" He wandered off, and I never saw him again.'</p> <p>Relatives of Robert Johnson's half-sister have disputed Claud Johnson's claim, saying he only claimed kinship after Johnson's music became valuable in the Eighties.</p> <p>In 1992, his mother swore in court that Johnson had fathered her son, and was backed up by another woman who said she had seen the pair having sex. DNA evidence is not available as no one knows where Johnson is buried. He left no will because he had nothing to pass on but his music, which few seemed interested in at the time.</p> <p>'As far as we know, Johnson is buried \"down by the highwayside, so his old evil spirit can get a Greyhound bus and ride\",' said Judge Mike Mills last week, quoting Johnson's song, 'Me and the Devil Blues'.</p> <p>What is certain is that the singer was also the father of the blues. His works introduced a musical and lyrical vocabulary that are the basis of the modern blues and blues-based rock. 'What is so remarkable,' says Peter Guralnik, author of Searching for Robert Johnson, 'is the way each song was focused in a way a lot of blues songs aren't.'</p> <p>He is credited with blues standards such as 'Dust My Broom', which Elmore James made into an anthem, 'Sweet Home Chicago,' 'Ramblin on My Mind,' 'Crossroads' (covered by Cream) and 'Love in Vain' and 'Stop Breaking Down' (recorded by the Rolling Stones).</p> <p>He was born out of wedlock in 1911 in Mississippi and lived with his mother and baby sister in a number of homes. He began playing Jew's harp, then harmonica. Poor eyesight and lack of interest in education led him to leave school early and sometime in the late Twenties, he picked up the guitar.</p> <p>Inspired by journeymen musicians, Johnson avoided the sharecropping life he seemed destined for and took to the road. Supposedly he learnt the blues playing his guitar while sitting atop tombstones and began writing down his songs.</p> <p>In the early Thirties, he left his birthplace for the Mississippi Delta, where he played with such legends as Elmore James, Howlin' Wolf, Memphis Slim and Sonny Boy Williamson.</p> <p>His wife, whom he married at 17, had a nervous breakdown and returned home. Always attractive to women, he became the object of jealousy from fellow musicians and betrayed boyfriends and husbands. As his legend grew, he began to claim that he learnt to play guitar from the Devil himself and his recordings evince a haunting, other-worldly inspiration.</p> <p>Johnson played his last show in August 1938 at a roadhouse, where he attempted to rekindle a relationship with the owner's wife. Sonny Boy Williamson, who was with him, cautioned him not to drink from an open whiskey bottle he was offered.</p> <p>Johnson ignored the warning, and he died three days later of strychnine poisoning.</p> <p>As last week's ruling seemed to close a chapter in the story, his son said he would never forget the sight of his father as a 'clean-cut', sharply dressed young man. 'I was fortunate,' Claud said. 'At least I got to see him.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "The troubled saga of blues singer Robert Johnson, poisoned at 29 by the jealous husband of one of his lovers, was reopened last week when a judge ruled that a retired truck driver was his son. Johnson, a towering figure in twentieth century music who helped create the live fast, die young rock'n'roll stereotype, wrote the classic blues standards 'Love in Vain,' 'Hellhound on my Tail' and 'Rambling on My Mind'. He always said he had met the devil on a crossroads one dark Mississippi night and exchanged his soul for his talent. Until last week's ruling by the Mississippi Supreme Court it was believed he had died without an heir. But 63 years after his death in 1938, the court ruled that Claud Johnson, from Crystal Springs, is the flesh-and-blood of a man so steeped in mythology that it is hard to say where the legend ends and the truth begins. After years of legal battles, Claud Johnson should now receive more than $1 million in music royalties. 'All my life I have known that he was my father,' said Johnson, whose mother Virgie Jane Smith had an affair with the singer in 1931, resulting in his birth. The musician visited Smith a year before he died. 'We were living in my granddaddy's and grandmama's house,' Johnson said. 'They were religious people, and they thought that the blues was the devil's music. People back then believed that. 'They told my daddy they didn't want no part of him. They said he was working for the devil. They wouldn't even let me go out and touch him. I stood in the door, and he stood on the ground, and that is as close as I ever got to him. Finally, he said, \"Well, I might as well go.\" He wandered off, and I never saw him again.' Relatives of Robert Johnson's half-sister have disputed Claud Johnson's claim, saying he only claimed kinship after Johnson's music became valuable in the Eighties. In 1992, his mother swore in court that Johnson had fathered her son, and was backed up by another woman who said she had seen the pair having sex. DNA evidence is not available as no one knows where Johnson is buried. He left no will because he had nothing to pass on but his music, which few seemed interested in at the time. 'As far as we know, Johnson is buried \"down by the highwayside, so his old evil spirit can get a Greyhound bus and ride\",' said Judge Mike Mills last week, quoting Johnson's song, 'Me and the Devil Blues'. What is certain is that the singer was also the father of the blues. His works introduced a musical and lyrical vocabulary that are the basis of the modern blues and blues-based rock. 'What is so remarkable,' says Peter Guralnik, author of Searching for Robert Johnson, 'is the way each song was focused in a way a lot of blues songs aren't.' He is credited with blues standards such as 'Dust My Broom', which Elmore James made into an anthem, 'Sweet Home Chicago,' 'Ramblin on My Mind,' 'Crossroads' (covered by Cream) and 'Love in Vain' and 'Stop Breaking Down' (recorded by the Rolling Stones). He was born out of wedlock in 1911 in Mississippi and lived with his mother and baby sister in a number of homes. He began playing Jew's harp, then harmonica. Poor eyesight and lack of interest in education led him to leave school early and sometime in the late Twenties, he picked up the guitar. Inspired by journeymen musicians, Johnson avoided the sharecropping life he seemed destined for and took to the road. Supposedly he learnt the blues playing his guitar while sitting atop tombstones and began writing down his songs. In the early Thirties, he left his birthplace for the Mississippi Delta, where he played with such legends as Elmore James, Howlin' Wolf, Memphis Slim and Sonny Boy Williamson. His wife, whom he married at 17, had a nervous breakdown and returned home. Always attractive to women, he became the object of jealousy from fellow musicians and betrayed boyfriends and husbands. As his legend grew, he began to claim that he learnt to play guitar from the Devil himself and his recordings evince a haunting, other-worldly inspiration. Johnson played his last show in August 1938 at a roadhouse, where he attempted to rekindle a relationship with the owner's wife. Sonny Boy Williamson, who was with him, cautioned him not to drink from an open whiskey bottle he was offered. Johnson ignored the warning, and he died three days later of strychnine poisoning. As last week's ruling seemed to close a chapter in the story, his son said he would never forget the sight of his father as a 'clean-cut', sharply dressed young man. 'I was fortunate,' Claud said. 'At least I got to see him.'",

      "bodyText": "The Cosa Nostra - pronounced dead after a sweeping crackdown, internationally and in New York - is back. Only now, the Italian Mafia is making a new kind of killing, moving into the dot.com bull market. The arrests of 120 men and women last week for the biggest stock market fraud in American history shows the Mafia has created a mirror-image of legitimate business on Wall Street. The arrests spell out a chilling message: that although the established families of the Italian mob have been either wiped out or ousted from their traditional terrain of protection rackets and drug dealing, they have become more powerful and richer than ever by moving into the world of high finance. 'You have criminals becoming businessmen on Wall Street,' says Robert Castelli, a former officer in the New York organised crime task force. Briefings to The Observer after the arrests reveal that the extent of the mob's slice of Wall Street stock dealing is even greater than that uncovered by last week's heist, and that Cosa Nostra families have formed strategic alliances not only with each other but with a former rival - the Russian 'Mafiya'. The indictments show that in moving from the criminal underworld into the financial sector, the Mafia has cast off its old antagonisms in order to form a bloc, cheating investors and reaping rewards worth millions. 'The main reason for the move into high finance,' says Barry Mawn, director of the FBI's New York office, 'is there's an endless pot of money. They can all make money'. The indictments reveal that all five of the big Italian organised crime families in New York - Gambino, Genovese, Lucchese, Bonanno and Colombo - had come together in a formidable coalition to manipulate publicly-traded securities in 19 companies, cheating investors out of $50 million over a period of five years. Court papers show a miasma of criminal infiltration of the securities industry, with the defendants in many cases aiming to exploit the internet boom, touting their front companies as dot.com players. Some 20 defendants in particular are charged with a racketeering conspiracy. Among those arrested was 'Little Robert' Lino, a whizzkid accountant for the Bonannos, and Frankie Perisco, cousin of Alfonse Perisco, said to be the Godfather of the Colombo clan. Officials say that the Mafia's quiet switch to white-collar crime and financial plunder began in the mid Nineties as a new generation of young mobsters, who were knowledgable about new technology and international finance replaced the gangsters and godfathers. These young bloods within the old clans moved initially into three areas: health insurance scams, pre-paid telephone cards and brokerage houses on Wall Street. The first lead towards this week's haul was the 1997 cracking of a health insurance racket run by a Mafia-backed company called Tri-Con. There were further indictments for 'loan-sharking' - offering loans to brokers in debt, then forcing them to sell stock before it became available to investors. Sources in the organised crime division of the FBI told how the mob then established a network of stock promoters and security dealers in the all-important 'boiler-rooms' that sell stocks nationwide through cold-calling. The authorities were called into Wall Street during 1996, after several traders and brokers were subjected to increasingly violent levels of 'persuasion' to deal in stocks and shares wanted or controlled by organised crime families as well as elements of the incoming Russian mob. The mob's activities were confined, say authorities, to stocks traded on the 'bulletin board' of the NASDAQ markets, rather than issues through the New York Stock Exchange. The prime mover in the Wall Street operation is the Bonnano family, which was believed to be heading for extinction less than a decade ago, after years of feuding with rivals and the ravages wreaked by then District Attorney Rudy Giuliani. But the Bonanno family began its resurgence after the release and recovery of Joe Massimo, who seized control of the clan after coming out of prison in 1993. Police sources say that Massimo's dazzling skills with computers and grasp of the financial markets combined with his close ties to the Sicilian homeland enabled the Bonannos to become the first crime family to crash the bull market during the mid-1990s. Over the past three years, two of Massimo's men - Frankie Limo and recently Frank Coppa - have been indicted for multi-million dollar stock swindles. The arrest of Coppa in March this year led investigators down an unexpected and disturbing trail. He, along with 18 others, formed a cadre of stockbrokers who had cheated unsuspecting investors out of $40 million in an elaborate fraud scheme whereby blocks of stocks were purchased and artificially inflated by flooding the marketplace with misleading information. The arrest showed that the Bonannos were making some terrifying alliances, and not just with former rivals from the Gambino family. Also indicted were two leading members of the Russian 'Mafiya'. Lewis Schirillo, assistant director for the FBI in New York, said 'they (the Russians) have the ability to bring in an international money-laundering angle, particularly with overseas accounts'. The Russian mob have infamously penetrated the Bank of New York, whose former executive Lucy Edwards and her husband Peter Berlin were convicted in April for masterminding the largest money-laundering scheme in US history involving $10 billion in 160,000 wire transfers. Sources tell The Observer that the alliance between the Italians and Russians was forged between the Genovese clan and the Zilber brothers, Vladimir and Alex. The Russians then expanded their alliances to include the Gambinos.",

      "bodyText": "The World Health Organisation will this week declare Britain's NHS one of the best health systems. In the first-ever official ranking of the performance of health services, the WHO will declare that Britons have a better system than Americans, Canadians, Germans, Danes, Swiss, Swedes, New Zealanders and Australians - the very countries with which the UK is usually unfavourably compared. The Department of Health declined to comment, although one government source said: 'I'm shocked.' The World Health Report 2000, to be published on Wednesday, will declare that out of 191 health systems in the world, Britain comes eighteenth, far ahead of the US, in 37th place. This is despite the fact that Britain spends less on health than every other developed nation. The report is likely to be welcomed by those who still support the founding principles of the totally tax-funded NHS, with little comfort for those who prefer to boost the idea of private health care. The WHO claims that France has the best health system in the world, with only a few other major European countries, including Italy, Spain and Norway, ahead of the UK. Sierra Leone and Burma have the worst.",

Official figures last week showed that 47 per cent of the cars operated by Whitehall departments are made outside the UK. In some departments more than two thirds of the cars used are made overseas. The figures - indicating that the civil servant's first choice is a BMW, Volvo or Mercedes rather than a Rover or Vauxhall - have sparked outrage and calls from MPs for a new law requiring the country of manufacture to be displayed on all new cars. Worst offenders include John Prescott's Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions, Jack Straw's Home Office, Mo Mowlam's Cabinet Office and Lord Irvine's Lord Chancellor's Department. Only 29 per cent of DETR cars were made in Britain. The Home Office fleet is 31 per cent British made, the Cabinet Office 32 per cent and the Lord Chancellor's Department 39 per cent. The news follows frantic attempts by ministers in the past few months to shore up the failing UK car industry, following BMW's dumping of Rover in March and Ford's announcement last month that it would end production at its Dagenham plant in Essex, costing 2,000 jobs. The figures have drawn angry responses from Labour backbenchers, industry figures and union leaders. Ian Pearson, MP for Dudley South, in the middle of Britain's West Midlands car production heartland, uncovered the figures through asking parliamentary questions. Pearson was scathing about the results. 'This is an appalling track record, particularly given the crisis in the industry. The Government should be using taxpayers' money to set an example and buy British cars to keep our people in jobs.' Pearson's knowledge of West Midlands car manufacturing saw him appointed by the Government to the emergency task force set up to deal with the Rover crisis. Prompted by what he has discovered, he is consulting industry experts on a law which would require cars being sold in Britain to display their country of origin. He is supported by union leaders. Sir Ken Jackson, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union said: 'There is a major problem here.' However, the figures will be a relief for Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers. The DTI had the second best record, buying 13 of its total 19 cars from the UK.

      "body": "<p>The SNP is trying to put behind it some nasty little local difficulties which last week tested to breaking point the view that there is no such thing as bad publicity. Behind the crisis is growing unease about whether the party's gradualism can survive the winds of populism.</p> <p>The removal of Ian Blackford as treasurer and a rap on the knuckles for Margo MacDonald from the parliamentary group involved some long-standing rivalries, particularly with convener Alex Salmond.</p> <p>Then the week ended with yet more bad news. Lloyd Quinan MSP quit his post as a deputy spokesman on social justice, apparently 'furious' at MacDonald's treatment. His job went to Tricia Marwick who, along with Kenny MacAskill, charged with temporarily balancing the books, was once a so-called fundamentalist.</p> <p>Beneath the surface turbulence lies the fear that the leadership's gradualist stance - which sees the road to independence as a long march with stages - will blur the party's commitment to its core objective and that, as one seasoned nationalist said, 'personal feuds will win out over policies'.</p> <p>And as Tommy Sheridan, the leader of the Scottish Socialist Party now making a major impact on the political scene, hogged the headlines with his wedding in Glasgow yesterday, the old Nat gloomily added: 'If the leadership don't develop some populist policies soon, then the party will grow dispirited and won't campaign effectively.'</p> <p>The immediate cause of Blackford's departure after a vote of no confidence was his attempts to rein in the party's overdraft, said to be in the region of \u00a3400,000. Some of this arose from last year's Scottish election campaign when the party tried to counter a fiercely hostile press by publishing its own newspaper. Blackford's view was that the cost of \u00a360,000 brought no measurable effect. When Blackford said last year that there would be no 'jiggery-pokery' with the books, Salmond was furi ous at the implication of malpractice.</p> <p>Salmond's rivalry with Blackford goes back much further. As young Turks, they were both expelled by then leader Gordon Wilson when he cracked down on the left-wing 79 Group in the early Eighties. Salmond was readmitted and quickly outpaced his contemporaries. Blackford went to London to make his fortune in banking, returning to the SNP after a period in the Labour Party.</p> <p>By now their mutual dislike had crystallised and it was only a matter of time before they clashed. The immediate reason for Blackford's removal as treasurer was that by imposing stringent financial controls, he was threatening Salmond's ability to lead the party in general and to control the next campaign in particular. To do the latter he needs unfettered access to party funds. His immediate justification was that Blackford had made accountancy mistakes in the last financial report. Newspaper leaks about the SNP's debts were also laid at Blackford's door, a charge which he denies.</p> <p>But Salmond angered many in the party by pursuing last Saturday's vote of no confidence in Blackford's absence. The party may not have entirely approved of Blackford, particularly after a highly critical newspaper article he wrote during last year's conference, but it also dislikes the appearance of unfair treatment.</p> <p>The mistake Blackford made was to threaten to sue Salmond for defamation. The party is remarkably loyal and resents any attempt to publicise 'family' arguments. He was promptly suspended and his duties were handed over to MacAskill.</p> <p>Blackford is now keeping a low profile but promises to fight his corner at the next annual conference. Suggestions yesterday that Blackford's acceptance of an invitation to address the Tory First Tuesday club had contributed to his predicament are not thought to be significant.</p> <p>While this played itself out on the front pages and radio bulletins, another row was gathering momentum. Margo MacDonald, MSP for the Lothians, was facing censure by the parliamentary group for publicly doubting the decision not to hold a debate on the medical use of cannabis. Thursday's meeting concluded that MacDonald be given a written warning, but rejected Chief Whip Bruce Crawford's move to issue a final warning.</p> <p>Once again, there is a great deal of historical baggage. MacDonald burst as a blonde bombshell into Scottish politics when she won the Govan seat in a by-election in 1973. Although she lost it at the first general election of the following year, she found herself in constant conflict with the parliamentary group because of her command of the domestic Scottish media as deputy leader between 1974 and 1979.</p> <p>But her dislike of Salmond, of which she makes very little secret, dates from the leadership contest of 1990 when he refused to abide by a deal brokered by the departing Gordon Wilson that Margaret Ewing would be elected unopposed. Salmond's decision to stand and subsequent victory sidelined her husband, Jim Sillars, SNP MP for Govan from 1988 to 1992 and now a pugnacious columnist for the Scottish Sun , who had agreed to abide by the Wilson-Ewing deal.</p> <p>MacDonald is also a friend of Ian Blackford. This made it appear as if the party was purging critics of Salmond. In fact, there is no link between the two events beyond miserable coincidence. Salmond now appeared not only vindictive but also as a control freak. Sections of the media were portraying the events of the week as a terrible fury visited on the fundamentalists by the gradualists.</p> <p>The notion that this is an ideological dispute between fundamentalists, who want outright independence as soon as possible, and gradualists, who want to arrive at independence through the increase in Holyrood's powers, is denied by all sides.</p> <p>Yet senior strategists also acknowledge that there is an underlying problem.</p> <p>They say that, even if the strategy of gradualism stays in place, the rhetoric must change to re-express the party's core values. The group of 35 MSPs is working hard to establish a new credibility for the party as a vehicle of government. Its short-term aim is to form the next administration and hold a referendum on independence.</p> <p>Yet administrative credibility is won at a price.

      "bodyText": "The SNP is trying to put behind it some nasty little local difficulties which last week tested to breaking point the view that there is no such thing as bad publicity. Behind the crisis is growing unease about whether the party's gradualism can survive the winds of populism. The removal of Ian Blackford as treasurer and a rap on the knuckles for Margo MacDonald from the parliamentary group involved some long-standing rivalries, particularly with convener Alex Salmond. Then the week ended with yet more bad news. Lloyd Quinan MSP quit his post as a deputy spokesman on social justice, apparently 'furious' at MacDonald's treatment. His job went to Tricia Marwick who, along with Kenny MacAskill, charged with temporarily balancing the books, was once a so-called fundamentalist. Beneath the surface turbulence lies the fear that the leadership's gradualist stance - which sees the road to independence as a long march with stages - will blur the party's commitment to its core objective and that, as one seasoned nationalist said, 'personal feuds will win out over policies'. And as Tommy Sheridan, the leader of the Scottish Socialist Party now making a major impact on the political scene, hogged the headlines with his wedding in Glasgow yesterday, the old Nat gloomily added: 'If the leadership don't develop some populist policies soon, then the party will grow dispirited and won't campaign effectively.' The immediate cause of Blackford's departure after a vote of no confidence was his attempts to rein in the party's overdraft, said to be in the region of \u00a3400,000. Some of this arose from last year's Scottish election campaign when the party tried to counter a fiercely hostile press by publishing its own newspaper. Blackford's view was that the cost of \u00a360,000 brought no measurable effect. When Blackford said last year that there would be no 'jiggery-pokery' with the books, Salmond was furi ous at the implication of malpractice. Salmond's rivalry with Blackford goes back much further. As young Turks, they were both expelled by then leader Gordon Wilson when he cracked down on the left-wing 79 Group in the early Eighties. Salmond was readmitted and quickly outpaced his contemporaries. Blackford went to London to make his fortune in banking, returning to the SNP after a period in the Labour Party. By now their mutual dislike had crystallised and it was only a matter of time before they clashed. The immediate reason for Blackford's removal as treasurer was that by imposing stringent financial controls, he was threatening Salmond's ability to lead the party in general and to control the next campaign in particular. To do the latter he needs unfettered access to party funds. His immediate justification was that Blackford had made accountancy mistakes in the last financial report. Newspaper leaks about the SNP's debts were also laid at Blackford's door, a charge which he denies. But Salmond angered many in the party by pursuing last Saturday's vote of no confidence in Blackford's absence. The party may not have entirely approved of Blackford, particularly after a highly critical newspaper article he wrote during last year's conference, but it also dislikes the appearance of unfair treatment. The mistake Blackford made was to threaten to sue Salmond for defamation. The party is remarkably loyal and resents any attempt to publicise 'family' arguments. He was promptly suspended and his duties were handed over to MacAskill. Blackford is now keeping a low profile but promises to fight his corner at the next annual conference. Suggestions yesterday that Blackford's acceptance of an invitation to address the Tory First Tuesday club had contributed to his predicament are not thought to be significant. While this played itself out on the front pages and radio bulletins, another row was gathering momentum. Margo MacDonald, MSP for the Lothians, was facing censure by the parliamentary group for publicly doubting the decision not to hold a debate on the medical use of cannabis. Thursday's meeting concluded that MacDonald be given a written warning, but rejected Chief Whip Bruce Crawford's move to issue a final warning. Once again, there is a great deal of historical baggage. MacDonald burst as a blonde bombshell into Scottish politics when she won the Govan seat in a by-election in 1973. Although she lost it at the first general election of the following year, she found herself in constant conflict with the parliamentary group because of her command of the domestic Scottish media as deputy leader between 1974 and 1979. But her dislike of Salmond, of which she makes very little secret, dates from the leadership contest of 1990 when he refused to abide by a deal brokered by the departing Gordon Wilson that Margaret Ewing would be elected unopposed. Salmond's decision to stand and subsequent victory sidelined her husband, Jim Sillars, SNP MP for Govan from 1988 to 1992 and now a pugnacious columnist for the Scottish Sun , who had agreed to abide by the Wilson-Ewing deal. MacDonald is also a friend of Ian Blackford. This made it appear as if the party was purging critics of Salmond. In fact, there is no link between the two events beyond miserable coincidence. Salmond now appeared not only vindictive but also as a control freak. Sections of the media were portraying the events of the week as a terrible fury visited on the fundamentalists by the gradualists. The notion that this is an ideological dispute between fundamentalists, who want outright independence as soon as possible, and gradualists, who want to arrive at independence through the increase in Holyrood's powers, is denied by all sides. Yet senior strategists also acknowledge that there is an underlying problem. They say that, even if the strategy of gradualism stays in place, the rhetoric must change to re-express the party's core values. The group of 35 MSPs is working hard to establish a new credibility for the party as a vehicle of government. Its short-term aim is to form the next administration and hold a referendum on independence. Yet administrative credibility is won at a price. One senior party analyst said that, if the SNP started to soften its stance on independence, another party might begin to nibble away at its populist roots. Sheridan, MSP and leader of the Scottish Socialist Party, has been mainly thought of as a threat to New Labour in Scotland. But he is a threat to the SNP, too. Indeed, one veteran Nat said that Sheridan's party reminded him of the SNP in the Sixties. It had some 'wonky' economic policies, but its membership was steadily building. Sheridan is becoming an undoubted star of the Scottish political scene, a gifted populist who paid his dues for his opposition to poll tax with a spell in Barlinnie jail - Sheridan is also an articulate and rational performer in the Scottish Parliament. Sharply dressed, good-looking, he is also a media star. Yesterday, when he married his fianc\u00e9e Gail Healy, he wore a kilt in the McLean tartan - in tribute to his hero John McLean, the legendary Scottish Socialist leader. Sheridan knows how to play to the populist mood. Labour - and the Nats - had better watch out.",

      "body": "<p>Bad guys and mad guys are abusing the internet. Old crimes are being committed in new ways. Children, consumers, trading companies and financial institutions have all been targeted and harmed, some very seriously. No government can sit back and ignore these trends, and in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) Bill our Government is trying to give law enforcement and security agencies some of the legal powers needed to catch up and help deliver what we all say we want the internet to be: a trusted medium. </p> <p>The Bill has undoubtedly stirred up opposition, but it is a very unattractive opposition whose hallmark is elitist, largely Thatcherite, and contemptuous of the encroachment of 'non-expert' democratic politicians on 'their terrain'. At the core of the Bill's opposition are the usual suspects - commerce and big business - but they have succeeded in co-opting respectable parts of the UK's civil liberties communities. </p> <p>One of the fiercest rows about the Bill has been engendered by the Government's proposals on encryption. Encryption technology allows anyone to encode any type of computer-based data. With the newer, stronger systems, once encoded the data becomes unrecognisable to anyone who does not have the correct key to unlock, to decrypt, the code. This might not only lead to a suspect escaping prosecution, but could also make it impossible for anyone to locate and help potential victims of any crimes which are being concealed under the encrypted cloak. </p> <p>Encryption techniques have been around since the time of the Pharoahs, but now that they have become linked to the industrial scale and ubiquity of the internet they introduce a wholly new dimension. Science and technology potentially has given the criminal community the power to put aspects of their activity beyond any realistic possibility of surveillance. </p> <p>In the Bill the Government is proposing to introduce a new power which would allow police to force a suspect to hand over the keys necessary to decrypt their files. Refusal to do so could result in a two-year jail sentence and a fine. </p> <p>For those engaged in serious crimes, the temptation not to hand over the key will be huge. If you know you might be facing 20 years or life if the police get the evidence off your machine, what are you going to do? You will refuse to hand over the key and risk a maximum of two years and a fine. Several people have pointed to the potential unfairness of requiring someone to prove a negative: that their failure to hand over their key was not a wilful and deliberate act of defiance, but instead was the product of a genuine lapse of memory. </p> <p>Let us not forget that the police would only have got the necessary authority to require the key to be handed over if they had first shown that they had reasonable grounds for believing that encryption technology was being used at the time, and a court was then later convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the accused's failure was deliberate. </p> <p>The European Encryption Group Working Group says in its briefing paper on the Bill that it is concerned that this new power reverses the burden of proof and thereby 'deviates from the traditional structure of English criminal law'. The internet did not exist when 'the traditional structure of English law' was being put together and it seems to me we have a simple choice: we can either hang out a sign saying 'It's all over' and just wait for the next wizard invention to come out of Massachusetts or Seattle - or Barnsley, for that matter - and see where that takes us all, or we can recognise that the internet is creating new challenges which require new solutions, not all of which will necessarily be able to marry with approaches we have taken in the past. Surely no one is saying that all we have to do is ask someone if they will hand over their key and if they say 'Hey, I'd love to, but shucks, it just plum slipped my mind!' that that is an end to the matter? Maybe they are, but excuse me if I dismiss it for the nonsense it plainly is.

      "bodyText": "Bad guys and mad guys are abusing the internet. Old crimes are being committed in new ways. Children, consumers, trading companies and financial institutions have all been targeted and harmed, some very seriously. No government can sit back and ignore these trends, and in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) Bill our Government is trying to give law enforcement and security agencies some of the legal powers needed to catch up and help deliver what we all say we want the internet to be: a trusted medium. The Bill has undoubtedly stirred up opposition, but it is a very unattractive opposition whose hallmark is elitist, largely Thatcherite, and contemptuous of the encroachment of 'non-expert' democratic politicians on 'their terrain'. At the core of the Bill's opposition are the usual suspects - commerce and big business - but they have succeeded in co-opting respectable parts of the UK's civil liberties communities. One of the fiercest rows about the Bill has been engendered by the Government's proposals on encryption. Encryption technology allows anyone to encode any type of computer-based data. With the newer, stronger systems, once encoded the data becomes unrecognisable to anyone who does not have the correct key to unlock, to decrypt, the code. This might not only lead to a suspect escaping prosecution, but could also make it impossible for anyone to locate and help potential victims of any crimes which are being concealed under the encrypted cloak. Encryption techniques have been around since the time of the Pharoahs, but now that they have become linked to the industrial scale and ubiquity of the internet they introduce a wholly new dimension. Science and technology potentially has given the criminal community the power to put aspects of their activity beyond any realistic possibility of surveillance. In the Bill the Government is proposing to introduce a new power which would allow police to force a suspect to hand over the keys necessary to decrypt their files. Refusal to do so could result in a two-year jail sentence and a fine. For those engaged in serious crimes, the temptation not to hand over the key will be huge. If you know you might be facing 20 years or life if the police get the evidence off your machine, what are you going to do? You will refuse to hand over the key and risk a maximum of two years and a fine. Several people have pointed to the potential unfairness of requiring someone to prove a negative: that their failure to hand over their key was not a wilful and deliberate act of defiance, but instead was the product of a genuine lapse of memory. Let us not forget that the police would only have got the necessary authority to require the key to be handed over if they had first shown that they had reasonable grounds for believing that encryption technology was being used at the time, and a court was then later convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the accused's failure was deliberate. The European Encryption Group Working Group says in its briefing paper on the Bill that it is concerned that this new power reverses the burden of proof and thereby 'deviates from the traditional structure of English criminal law'. The internet did not exist when 'the traditional structure of English law' was being put together and it seems to me we have a simple choice: we can either hang out a sign saying 'It's all over' and just wait for the next wizard invention to come out of Massachusetts or Seattle - or Barnsley, for that matter - and see where that takes us all, or we can recognise that the internet is creating new challenges which require new solutions, not all of which will necessarily be able to marry with approaches we have taken in the past. Surely no one is saying that all we have to do is ask someone if they will hand over their key and if they say 'Hey, I'd love to, but shucks, it just plum slipped my mind!' that that is an end to the matter? Maybe they are, but excuse me if I dismiss it for the nonsense it plainly is. Come up with a better solution and I'll buy it, but doing nothing is not an option. Our political institutions are finding it hard to keep up with the pace of change being ushered in by the internet, and the commercial-industrial-technological complex which is driving it clearly has its own agenda and its own priorities. So who will speak for civil society in this space? Who has the funding to commission independent technical research to come up with solutions to problems that industry thinks are benefits, or that it sees as being nowhere near as urgent as getting out the next release of an online game show? We truly want a 'people's internet'. We need new institutions, perhaps ones which can work alongside the longer-established institutions of our democracy: trade unions, consumer and other interest groups, children's organisations, political parties and so on, both here and abroad, to start to take charge of an agenda which had been creeping up on us by stealth, but which now seems to be well and truly out in the open.

The fledgling movement, set up by a former Countryside Alliance officer and a pro-shooting campaigner, plans to harry MPs in marginal seats by campaigning on rural grievances. Labour's Michael Foster, who led the initial backbench campaign against blood sports, faces a challenge in his Worcester seat - captured from the Tories with a 7,000 majority in 1997. Seats in the West Country and Highlands are also likely targets. Although the shoestring party has no chance of getting candidates elected, it hopes to cause maximum embarrassment in closely-fought seats where every vote counts. The Countryside Alliance, whose president is Labour peer Baroness Mallalieu, has officially dissociated itself from the new party, arguing that voters should support those who can govern. But it in turn plans to mobilise its 387,000 supporters against anti-hunting MPs from all parties. It is drawing up lists of where candidates in rural seats stand on issues from blood sports to farmers' subsidies and the closure of rural schools. The twin moves demonstrate the rural lobby's determination to turn the countryside into an electoral battleground, creating fresh headaches for Tony Blair. The Government's much-awaited rural White Paper is being delayed until the autumn as Ministers struggle to strike the right balance. Labour faces clashes with the landowning lobby over the Countryside Bill's provision of a 'right to roam' for ramblers, with Tory peers threatening to wreck it in revenge for the hunting ban. Ministers last week began making conciliatory noises to country voters, with Mo Mowlam promising an attack on rural poverty, and the Home Office more cash for rural policing. A Cabinet Office report on saving rural post offices is also imminent. Peter Bradley, leader of Labour's rural MPs group, says his colleagues are bullish about their chances, saying: 'One of the reasons I think we may surprise a lot of people is because Labour MPs in rural seats have penetrated those parts of their constituencies the Conservatives never knew existed.' However, the rural lobby insists the Government will feel a backlash at the polls. The Countryside Party was launched in April by retired engineer Richard Malbon, chair of the shooting organisation, the Sportsman's Association of Great Britain, and Jim Crawford, an ex-regional officer for the Countryside Alliance in Scotland. Operating on a shoestring, it has only a handful of active members so far. But Malbon, who describes himself as a disillusioned 'Tory with a small t', says it expects to fight at least four seats. 'We realise we have got an awful lot of work to do and not much time. But Foster's seat is a perfect one to go for.' Although the Countryside Alliance politely wished the new party well, Alliance chief executive Richard Burge - a card-carrying Labour Party member - dismisses it as a pointless distraction. The Alliance plans instead to interrogate all mainstream party candidates in rural seats on around 25 key issues, from hunting to closure of village schools, publishing the results before the election. 'We will make sure,' Burge says, 'that people know what their candidates think on particular areas. Hunting will be one of those, but they will be overwhelmed by the others.

      "bodyText": "Jack Straw's much criticised Bill to regulate the freedom of the internet is facing disaster in the Lords as critics organise a guerrilla campaign against the Government. More than 48 pages of amendments have been proposed to block the Home Secretary's proposals to increase the powers of the police and MI5 to intercept emails and access personal information kept on computers. Each of the 250 amendments will have to be discussed, delaying the Bill indefinitely and forcing the Government to give ground on key concerns over privacy and the costs to business. Managers of the parliamentary work load are worried that delays similar to those suffered by the Financial Services Bill will block other Bills the Government wants to enact to show it is delivering on its election promises. 'It will be a misjudgment if they think they are going to get this through simply by saying businesses are crying wolf and civil liberty groups should not be listened to,' said Lord McNally, the Liberal Democrat peer who is leading the campaign against the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill. 'The more you look at it, the more you see the problems apparent in this flawed Bill.' McNally said the Government would have to give ground on civil liberty and business demands before he and other peers would be satisfied. If the Government did not move, a coalition of Liberal Democrat and Conservative peers, together with the politically independent cross benchers and some Labour rebels, would join forces to wreck the Bill. News of the hundreds of delaying amendments comes as Straw is put under increasing pressure to water down the Bill's proposals. Businesses are furious at proposals forcing them to install internet 'black boxes' which could be used by the security services to look at confidential data. The Home Office says the powers are necessary to prevent widespread fraud. It also wants to force private users to allow access to encryption codes for their computers as a weapon against paedophiles and other criminals. Last week, Straw dismissed a claim by the British Chambers of Commerce that the need for black boxes would cost businesses \u00a346 billion over the next five years. There have been suggestions that up to 40 per cent of ecommerce companies could decamp abroad or go offshore if the Bill becomes law. 'The important thing is not to shoot the business goose before it lays any golden eggs,' McNally said. Straw said critics were relying on scaremongering to try to undermine the Bill. 'It is unclear how the \u00a346bn figure is arrived at,' he said in a letter to the Financial Times . 'The year-by-year estimates are literally incredible. The BCC document is riddled with flawed assumptions.' He said crime cost the country \u00a350bn a year and that new powers were needed so that 'ecommerce is better protected from user attack by serious criminals'. The Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors have raised concerns about the Bill. Last week, Stephen Byers, the Trade and Industry Secretary, said he was aware of business concerns. 'The question is, what does the Home Office know about the commercial world,' one source said.

Civil liberties groups have said the Bill contains attacks on people's freedom. The Home Secretary will have powers to demand keys that allow the public to encrypt work on their computers. If people fail to hand over the keys or forget their encryption codes they face going to prison for up to two years. Why the Government says the RIP Bill is a good idea... \u0095 Gives police powers to monitor and intercept emails and websites through which criminals have been able to communicate. \u0095 Some data on computers, like child pornography, is encrypted. The Bill makes it illegal to not decrypt data when police ask. \u0095 It brings the UK into line with the surveillance measures of some other European countries. Why campaigners say the RIP Bill is a bad idea... \u0095 Cost and maintenance of necessary surveillance equipment will be passed on to internet user, threatening UK's competitiveness as an ecommerce market. \u0095 The Bill allows government to monitor sites you visit and who you email - without a warrant. \u0095 You could be jailed for two years for forgetting passwords.",

The country which for most of its life has bled emigrants is now attracting immigrants on a scale never before imagined. The rest of northern Europe has, to a better or worse degree, come to terms with a multi-cultural society, but Ireland is probably the most 'white' country in western Europe.

Eventually, we flagged down a passing Garda car and they organised someone to take the wreck away.'</p> <p>Tambwe recalled that a friend of his had been attacked in a nightclub, with someone breaking a bottle on his head. Far from coming to protect him, 'the bouncers grabbed him by the throat and threw him out of the club. When the ambulance came, the ambulanceman made a racist remark: \"if you were in your country, you wouldn't get this help. Go back home\".'</p> <p>The racism of the ambulanceman was, Tambwe believed, indicative of Ireland's true attitude towards black asylum-seekers.</p> <p>Then something happened to suggest he was not exaggerating. As my colleague took his photograph, a grey van crawled by and the - white - passenger yelled abuse at Tambwe. In the centre of Dublin the grey metal shutter of what was an Afro-Caribbean shop has been daubed with the word 'nigers' - the racists can't spell - which no one in authority has cared to clean up.</p> <p>One Nigerian asylum-seeker, Remi Awogboro, contrasts what Irish people expect from America to how they treat their own refugees. He has copies of a 1985 newspaper report in which Bertie Ahern calls for 70,000 illegal immigrants to the US to be given amnesty.</p> <p>'I wasn't born a refugee or an asylum-seeker. It's my circumstances,' said Awogboro. He said he wanted people in authority to 'accept us for what we are and to sympathise with us. I don't want to live like this. I want to be part of this society.'</p> <p>Awogboro said Irish immigrants in the US were not called refugees, they were called Irish Americans, 'so why not have a change of policy in Ireland?'</p> <p>Ireland's record is by no means all bad. In Kildare, an old army barracks square has been converted into a trailer park for refugees from Kosovo. Fellanza Balaj, 17, from Pristina, pointed to 21 teddy bears she had been given by Irish well-wishers. 'It's been great here. I have lots of Irish friends, and I work in the pizza factory. I want to go home because I miss home, but I love Ireland.'</p> <p>Her brother, Mohammed, sports a Guinness T-shirt and a soft Irish brogue. 'I had to learn the accent because everybody kept on saying \"wha?\" It's easy for us [but] at the mosque in Dublin I meet Algerians, Iraqis, and they say it is very difficult for them. We are war refugees and everyone understands that. But for the others, life is not so good.'</p> <p>Fellanza and Mohammed may have been too polite to say so, but they are white. Tambwe said: 'When I was young in Rwanda we were taught by an Irish Catholic priest who told us lots of stories about Ireland, how lovely it was, how lucky we would be if we had just one day here. Well, now I know. When I walk down the street I keep on looking around, just to check that no one is going to hit me.'</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:john.sweeney@observer.co.uk\">john.sweeney@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

One Nigerian asylum-seeker, Remi Awogboro, contrasts what Irish people expect from America to how they treat their own refugees. He has copies of a 1985 newspaper report in which Bertie Ahern calls for 70,000 illegal immigrants to the US to be given amnesty. 'I wasn't born a refugee or an asylum-seeker. It's my circumstances,' said Awogboro. He said he wanted people in authority to 'accept us for what we are and to sympathise with us. I don't want to live like this. I want to be part of this society.' Awogboro said Irish immigrants in the US were not called refugees, they were called Irish Americans, 'so why not have a change of policy in Ireland?' Ireland's record is by no means all bad. In Kildare, an old army barracks square has been converted into a trailer park for refugees from Kosovo. Fellanza Balaj, 17, from Pristina, pointed to 21 teddy bears she had been given by Irish well-wishers. 'It's been great here. I have lots of Irish friends, and I work in the pizza factory. I want to go home because I miss home, but I love Ireland.' Her brother, Mohammed, sports a Guinness T-shirt and a soft Irish brogue. 'I had to learn the accent because everybody kept on saying \"wha?\" It's easy for us [but] at the mosque in Dublin I meet Algerians, Iraqis, and they say it is very difficult for them. We are war refugees and everyone understands that. But for the others, life is not so good.' Fellanza and Mohammed may have been too polite to say so, but they are white. Tambwe said: 'When I was young in Rwanda we were taught by an Irish Catholic priest who told us lots of stories about Ireland, how lovely it was, how lucky we would be if we had just one day here. Well, now I know. When I walk down the street I keep on looking around, just to check that no one is going to hit me.' john.sweeney@observer.co.uk",

The first atlas of sexual behaviour has revealed them as the sexual tigers of Europe. They start young, have lots of sex and last a lot longer than anyone else.</p> <p>In total, the average British person has sex 2,580 times during his or her lifetime, with five different people. However, they are also about the most unfaithful in Europe, with 42 per cent admitting to sexual infidelity.</p> <p>Perhaps more shockingly, Italian men - dark, suave and sophisticated, and the supposed dream lover of every British woman - are revealed as the pandas of the Continent.</p> <p>Their reputation as the world's hottest sex machines is shattered by a barrage of humbling statistics that reveal the naked truth: they start having sex late, they don't have it often, and when they do it's all over in the blink of an eye. In fact, Italians are the least sexually active people in Europe, and when they do have sex, it lasts the shortest time.</p> <p>Every day 120 million acts of sexual intercourse take place around the world - resulting in 910,000 conceptions. On average, it lasts 21 minutes in the UK, compared with 17 in Germany, 14 in Italy and 10 in Thailand (where they do it quickest). The Brazilians, who average 30 minutes, are the world's sexual gold medallists (although 44 per cent of Brazilian women confess faking orgasms).</p> <p>The Penguin Atlas of Human Sexual Behaviour - a serious academic study dressed up as soft porn - categorises each nation by its most intimate details, painting a fascinating but often bizarre insight into different cultures.</p> <p>The revelations can be unflattering: 46 per cent of American women think a good night's sleep is better than sex. They can be disturbing: 23 per cent of Germans are sexually stimulated by underarm odour. And they can be upsetting: in Egypt, 80 per cent of women suffer female genital excision,although it is banned by law.</p> <p>The author, Professor Judith Mackay, an adviser to the World Health Organisation and a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, also helps explain the behaviour of certain relatives: 'Some aged ants, aphids, wasps, bees, naked vole rats and Caribbean snapping shrimps abandon procreation and invest their energies into helping relatives' genes survival,' she writes.</p> <p>It isn't only the Italians who have their reputation shattered. Irish women - often portrayed as good girls oppressed by the weight of Catholicism -lose their virginity at 16, younger than most other women in Europe, a year before Swedish women and two years before British ones.</p> <p>Other stereotypes are dramatically confirmed. Gallic pride is unchallenged, with the French having the most sex of anyone in Europe, doing it more than 130 times a year. Apart from the Irish, women from Finland, Denmark and Iceland are the most sexually advanced in Europe: on average, they lose their virginity at 16, and by the age of 18 around three-quarters of them are having sex.</p> <p>In Europe, it's in the traditional Mediterranean countries that women develop latest. Only one in four women of 18 in Greece and Portugal is sexually active, and on average they wait till they are 19 to lose their virginity.</p> <p>During the Second World War, jealous British men dubbed Americans as over-sexed, and little seems to have changed.</p> <p>By almost all measures, Americans are more sexual than British people. Both men and women lose their virginity younger, and they have sex more times a year than their limey counterparts - and the sex lasts a lot longer (well, seven minutes).</p> <p>However, the US is bucking one global trend. Whereas in most of the world, young people are becoming sexually active at an earlier and earlier age, it is rising in America - possibly as a result of increasing sex education. High school children are more likely to be virgins - and less likely to have had multiple partners - than they were 10 years ago.</p> <p>Even so, the West is revealed as being far more sexual than developping nations - with the exception of Africa.</p> <p>In the West, men and women lose their virginity at about the same age. But in most developing countries, women become sexually active much later than men. In Kazakhstan, Thailand, Ecuador and the Philippines, women usually lose their virginity after the age of 20.</p> <p>In many developing countries, there are far stricter rules governing women's sexuality. In most of Asia, under 10 per cent of women younger than 20 have had sex outside marriage. In Britain and Germany, it is 70 per cent.</p> <p>All over Latin America, women usually wait till they are over 18 for sex. For men, it is closer to 16. In some countries, such as Peru, statisticians claim men are losing their virginity three years earlier than women, which begs the question of who they are losing it to.</p> <p>In stark contrast, women in Africa start having sex many years earlier than men. Throughout much of West Africa - including Mali, Niger and Guinea - women lose their virginity at 15 on average; in most of the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, it is 16. For men, it's usually a couple of years later.</p> <p>These age differences are reflected in attitudes to marriage partners. Zambia and Nigeria are two of the most ageist countries in the world, with men looking for wives who are more than six years younger than themselves. In most of Europe, and North America, men look for wives who are less than two years younger than themselves.</p> <p>The Atlas of Human Sexual Behaviour also grimly reveals the darker side - and dismal consequences - of sex.</p> <p>Britain has more teenage abortions than any other county in Western Europe, with 20 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19 having abortions every year, compared with two per thousand in Germany. In many other countries, the figure is far higher, with 45 per 1,000 teenage girls in Bulgaria having abortions every year.</p> <p>It is not only teenagers who are unable to control their fertility. Worldwide, 300 million couples have no access to family planning. In Africa, less than 10 per cent of married women are using a modern form of contraception.</p> <p>The lack of contraception is starkly reflected in the number of babies that women have. The average number of births per woman is under two everywhere, except Africa, Middle East and South Asia.</p> <p>But, by a large margin, it is African women who have the largest families. They start young, with more than 10 per cent of teenage girls giving birth in Africa each year. In Guinea, one in four girls aged 15 to 19 gives birth every year.</p> <p>By the time they have finished, women in almost all Africa countries have had more than five babies each. In Niger, they have eight babies each.</p> <p>The lack of safe contraception is also reflected in the epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases, particularly Aids. Across the world, 18.4 million people live with Aids, but Africa is by far the worst hit continent. In all of southern Africa, more than 10 per cent of people are HIV positive. In contrast, Europe - with years of safe sex campaigns - has ended up the most Aids-free area of the world outside Central Asia and the Middle East. In Britain, fewer than 0.1 per cent of people are infected.</p> <p>Sex has also become one of the world's largest industries. In Thailand, the sex industry is worth $25 billion a year, employing 200,000 child prostitutes. But that total is dwarfed by the US, with 300,000 child prostitutes, and Brazil, with 600,000.</p> <p><b>British</b></p> <p>World's highest number of unmarried teenage pregnancies.

There will be the usual exhibition of hand-wringing and condemnation. But there are no excuses. It is time we faced the facts. It is English society that produces slobbishness, violence and xenophobia.</p> <p>The Conservative Party and its allies in the press like to mock political correctness, but the first target for change has to be the increasing cultural acceptance of a xenophobic attitude to foreigners - and that means the language which we use. The tabloid and right-wing broadsheet press and those who ape it on television and radio argue that their continual use of comic-book Second World War imagery over the Germans is no more than harmless fun. That the bile poured over the European Union is deserved. That the language used to describe asylum-seekers reflects the popular mood.</p> <p>They are wrong. What has been constructed is a daily infusion of poisonous, mindless jingoism feeding prejudice and hatred. No less seriously, it is one that interacts with a growing sense of powerlessness and lack of self-esteem among those at the bottom of our unequal society. Typically, bullying and aggression stem from the weak rather than the strong. The drunk, violent, bare-chested English football fan, tattooed with the cross of St George, is the product of a winner-takes-all-society in which he has little chance, but which gives him the chance to ventilate his frustration by identifying foreigners as the enemy.</p> <p>You will not read this diagnosis in the right-wing press that has done so much to produce this phenomenon, but that does not make it any less true. A liberal, tolerant, more equal society would produce less football violence. Until we have it, expect more of the same.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Once again, England has been confronted by the shaming spectacle of its football fans running amok at an international football tournament. There will be the usual exhibition of hand-wringing and condemnation. But there are no excuses. It is time we faced the facts. It is English society that produces slobbishness, violence and xenophobia. The Conservative Party and its allies in the press like to mock political correctness, but the first target for change has to be the increasing cultural acceptance of a xenophobic attitude to foreigners - and that means the language which we use. The tabloid and right-wing broadsheet press and those who ape it on television and radio argue that their continual use of comic-book Second World War imagery over the Germans is no more than harmless fun. That the bile poured over the European Union is deserved. That the language used to describe asylum-seekers reflects the popular mood. They are wrong. What has been constructed is a daily infusion of poisonous, mindless jingoism feeding prejudice and hatred. No less seriously, it is one that interacts with a growing sense of powerlessness and lack of self-esteem among those at the bottom of our unequal society. Typically, bullying and aggression stem from the weak rather than the strong. The drunk, violent, bare-chested English football fan, tattooed with the cross of St George, is the product of a winner-takes-all-society in which he has little chance, but which gives him the chance to ventilate his frustration by identifying foreigners as the enemy. You will not read this diagnosis in the right-wing press that has done so much to produce this phenomenon, but that does not make it any less true. A liberal, tolerant, more equal society would produce less football violence. Until we have it, expect more of the same.",

Lazio was the stand-in that the Republican Party was forced to scramble when the world's most famous mayor, Rudy Giuliani of New York, pulled out of the race against Hillary Clinton for election to the United States Senate. 'It was a tremendous shock to Rick,' says Andrew Siben, a friend of his for 15 years. 'He simply wasn't expecting it.'</p> <p>The nomination made Lazio the underdog in a contest with a superstar First Lady and her presidential campaign manager and formidable fundraising machine. When Lazio tripped up and fell flat on his face at a Memorial Day parade it augured ill, recalling a similar mishap that befell Bob Dole, who fell off a podium shortly before being trounced by Hillary Clinton's husband in 1996.</p> <p>Over the past few weeks, however, Rick has achieved something remarkable. Lazio has stopped Hillary's juggernaut in its tracks. The First Lady - who had stolen a confident march against a Giuliani wounded by both health and marital problems - has peaked according to the latest polls. Now she is barely ahead of the young challenger.</p> <p>Whether this is to do with Hillary's numerous blunders, or with Lazio's canny game, is open to question. Despite Lazio's grin, his smooth skin and inane, preppie good looks, he is a man fired by ambition - as scheming a politician as his party could ever hope for. He is not unlike his opponent's husband - a man whose rise in politics comes not from rocking the boat, but by angling endlessly for a chance to row it and be all things to all people. An examination of his voting record shows him to be a moderate Republican but with some good friends on the hard Right.</p> <p>Lazio was born in 1958 in Lindenhurst, New York, son of a car-parts dealer. Hard to believe now, but he was a quiet, introverted child. The 1976 West Islip school yearbook features a picture of a cherubic young man in a Herman's Hermits haircut, a member of the coin and stamp clubs. Urged by his father (himself an eager Republican) to study, the young Riccardo Lazio won himself a place at the exclusive Vassar College, in the New York suburb of Poughkeepsie.</p> <p>Vassar was an anomaly. It had, until a year before Lazio's arrival, been one of America's most exclusive single-sex, twin-set-and-pearls women's colleges. With the first intake of men - coinciding as it did with the era of student protest - old Vassar experienced a cultural meltdown. One college acquaintance of Lazio told The Observer : 'It was like this. People would knock on your door and ask you to sleep with them. If you said yeah, fine. If you said no, they'd just move on to the next room.' Another spoke about 'parties when I remember naked women swinging from the chandeliers'.</p> <p>Throughout his time at college, however, and despite this bacchanalian atmosphere, Lazio faithfully dated a serious student called Jeanie McSweeney, who later went to work in the Ronald Reagan White House. For all the licentiousness of the day, Lazio and McSweeney did not have sex together until years into their relationship, according to those who know him.</p> <p>In the meantime he was busy organising college Republicans to assist in the Mid-Hudson 1976 Congressional campaign of James L. Buckley. It was unsuccessful, but enabled Lazio to put some political credit in the bank. (During the recent scramble to find a successor to Giuliani, it was former Senator Buckley who invited Lazio to Washington for a crucial lunch with the Republican Party's national leadership. It was that meeting that clinched the nomination.)</p> <p>Following in Giuliani's footsteps, the young Lazio became a public prosecutor and district attorney for New York's Suffolk County from 1983 to 1988. He then won an election to the county legislature and went into private law practice. By now, he and Miss McSweeney had parted company and he married Patricia Moriarty, a nurse.</p> <p>In 1992, Lazio entered national politics with a dirty and dogged campaign, which everybody seems now to have forgotten, but which should serve as a cautionary tale to Hillary Clinton. It was a challenge for a seat in the House of Representatives against a formidable incumbent and 18-year political veteran, Tom Downey, who had been elected to Congress aged 25 and was fighting Lazio with a kitty worth $1.4 million. Lazio, in response, ran up 151 personal overdrafts worth $276,000 at various banks, rooted out an undeclared junket trip to Barbados that Downey had taken, plus a number of dubious patronage appointments he had made - and won.</p> <p>Lazio's too-eager-to-please, genial veneer still conceals the steel that it took to beat Downey, maintaining his sugar-coated image in Republican Party's files as a 'retail campaigner'. One former aide recalls: 'He'd disappear on a weekend without a phone or pager, and we'd later find that he'd spent the day at the mall saying \"hi\" to people.' Indeed, the latest edition of New Republic magazine writes him off summarily as a 'fresh-faced Long Island Republican'.</p> <p>At home, he likes to cut a liberal, gad-about-town social profile, to be seen at the most fashionable restaurants and bars. But he also has a track record of alliances with the hard Right. He manoeuvred himself into the inner sanctum of the disgraced former House speaker, Newt Gingrich, becoming his effective bag-carrier. He is currently one of the \u00e9lite team that serves Republican chief whip Tom Delay of Texas, regarded as the hardest right-winger on the Washington block. He is also one of two special assistants to the Republican's House leader, the ruthless Dick Armey.</p> <p>His allies call Lazio 'a bridge across the ideological spectrum with friends in every camp'. His enemies see in him a chancer, an opportunist, a man who will ride whatever horse will carry him furthest.</p> <p>The idea is for everyone to find something in his voting record they can agree with. He challenged the National Rifle Association and in 1998 backed a reform bill to limit the amount spent on political campaigns, both of which angered his chums on the Right. Meanwhile, he has backed private-school vouchers and the $792-billion tax-cut bill, which were the brainchildren of those same chums.</p> <p>All of which makes campaigning difficult for Hillary Clinton - and for Lazio. On Thursday, Hillary responded to poor poll results by taking the offensive and accusing Lazio of being a marionette for the gun lobby with a voting record 'against the interests of women and children'. None of which is strictly true.</p> <p>Lazio had opened his campaign with a searing attack on Hillary's 'far Left' politics, which is an absurd description of a campaign desperate to roll back on as much radicalism as it can between now and November.</p> <p>The upshot is that each is now biting and scratching like Brooklyn alley cats. Hillary should win, and probably will - the Democrats are gloating over the abyss in stature between Lazio and the First Lady - and while Lazio will fight with a smile, he will fight tough. And if he wins his victory would be the hardest blow of all to the precarious Clinton legacy.</p> <p>Indeed, everyone in New York and beyond thought that the Clinton v Giuliani heavyweight bout would be the political equivalent to Clay v Liston. If so, Clinton v Lazio will be more like Fight Club, no rules and nasty.</p> <p><b> Riccardo Lazio</b><br></p> <p><b> DoB:</b> 1958 (Lindenhurst, New York)</p> <p><b> Lives:</b> Bay Shore, Long Island</p> <p><b> Married to: </b> Patricia Moriarty (two daughters - Molly Ann and Kelsey)</p> <p><b> Educated:</b> Vassar College, New York; American University (law)</p> <p><b> Job:</b> Republican Congressman for the Second District, New York (since 1992)</p> <p><b> Previous job: </b> Assistant DA</p>",

      "bodyText": "At first it was considered Rick Lazio's ill-fortune to be defined in terms of others. 'I was a nobody,' he said candidly on the radio last week. Lazio was the stand-in that the Republican Party was forced to scramble when the world's most famous mayor, Rudy Giuliani of New York, pulled out of the race against Hillary Clinton for election to the United States Senate. 'It was a tremendous shock to Rick,' says Andrew Siben, a friend of his for 15 years. 'He simply wasn't expecting it.' The nomination made Lazio the underdog in a contest with a superstar First Lady and her presidential campaign manager and formidable fundraising machine. When Lazio tripped up and fell flat on his face at a Memorial Day parade it augured ill, recalling a similar mishap that befell Bob Dole, who fell off a podium shortly before being trounced by Hillary Clinton's husband in 1996. Over the past few weeks, however, Rick has achieved something remarkable. Lazio has stopped Hillary's juggernaut in its tracks. The First Lady - who had stolen a confident march against a Giuliani wounded by both health and marital problems - has peaked according to the latest polls. Now she is barely ahead of the young challenger. Whether this is to do with Hillary's numerous blunders, or with Lazio's canny game, is open to question. Despite Lazio's grin, his smooth skin and inane, preppie good looks, he is a man fired by ambition - as scheming a politician as his party could ever hope for. He is not unlike his opponent's husband - a man whose rise in politics comes not from rocking the boat, but by angling endlessly for a chance to row it and be all things to all people. An examination of his voting record shows him to be a moderate Republican but with some good friends on the hard Right. Lazio was born in 1958 in Lindenhurst, New York, son of a car-parts dealer. Hard to believe now, but he was a quiet, introverted child. The 1976 West Islip school yearbook features a picture of a cherubic young man in a Herman's Hermits haircut, a member of the coin and stamp clubs. Urged by his father (himself an eager Republican) to study, the young Riccardo Lazio won himself a place at the exclusive Vassar College, in the New York suburb of Poughkeepsie. Vassar was an anomaly. It had, until a year before Lazio's arrival, been one of America's most exclusive single-sex, twin-set-and-pearls women's colleges. With the first intake of men - coinciding as it did with the era of student protest - old Vassar experienced a cultural meltdown. One college acquaintance of Lazio told The Observer : 'It was like this. People would knock on your door and ask you to sleep with them. If you said yeah, fine. If you said no, they'd just move on to the next room.' Another spoke about 'parties when I remember naked women swinging from the chandeliers'. Throughout his time at college, however, and despite this bacchanalian atmosphere, Lazio faithfully dated a serious student called Jeanie McSweeney, who later went to work in the Ronald Reagan White House. For all the licentiousness of the day, Lazio and McSweeney did not have sex together until years into their relationship, according to those who know him. In the meantime he was busy organising college Republicans to assist in the Mid-Hudson 1976 Congressional campaign of James L. Buckley. It was unsuccessful, but enabled Lazio to put some political credit in the bank. (During the recent scramble to find a successor to Giuliani, it was former Senator Buckley who invited Lazio to Washington for a crucial lunch with the Republican Party's national leadership. It was that meeting that clinched the nomination.) Following in Giuliani's footsteps, the young Lazio became a public prosecutor and district attorney for New York's Suffolk County from 1983 to 1988. He then won an election to the county legislature and went into private law practice. By now, he and Miss McSweeney had parted company and he married Patricia Moriarty, a nurse. In 1992, Lazio entered national politics with a dirty and dogged campaign, which everybody seems now to have forgotten, but which should serve as a cautionary tale to Hillary Clinton. It was a challenge for a seat in the House of Representatives against a formidable incumbent and 18-year political veteran, Tom Downey, who had been elected to Congress aged 25 and was fighting Lazio with a kitty worth $1.4 million. Lazio, in response, ran up 151 personal overdrafts worth $276,000 at various banks, rooted out an undeclared junket trip to Barbados that Downey had taken, plus a number of dubious patronage appointments he had made - and won. Lazio's too-eager-to-please, genial veneer still conceals the steel that it took to beat Downey, maintaining his sugar-coated image in Republican Party's files as a 'retail campaigner'. One former aide recalls: 'He'd disappear on a weekend without a phone or pager, and we'd later find that he'd spent the day at the mall saying \"hi\" to people.' Indeed, the latest edition of New Republic magazine writes him off summarily as a 'fresh-faced Long Island Republican'. At home, he likes to cut a liberal, gad-about-town social profile, to be seen at the most fashionable restaurants and bars. But he also has a track record of alliances with the hard Right. He manoeuvred himself into the inner sanctum of the disgraced former House speaker, Newt Gingrich, becoming his effective bag-carrier. He is currently one of the \u00e9lite team that serves Republican chief whip Tom Delay of Texas, regarded as the hardest right-winger on the Washington block. He is also one of two special assistants to the Republican's House leader, the ruthless Dick Armey. His allies call Lazio 'a bridge across the ideological spectrum with friends in every camp'. His enemies see in him a chancer, an opportunist, a man who will ride whatever horse will carry him furthest. The idea is for everyone to find something in his voting record they can agree with. He challenged the National Rifle Association and in 1998 backed a reform bill to limit the amount spent on political campaigns, both of which angered his chums on the Right. Meanwhile, he has backed private-school vouchers and the $792-billion tax-cut bill, which were the brainchildren of those same chums. All of which makes campaigning difficult for Hillary Clinton - and for Lazio. On Thursday, Hillary responded to poor poll results by taking the offensive and accusing Lazio of being a marionette for the gun lobby with a voting record 'against the interests of women and children'. None of which is strictly true. Lazio had opened his campaign with a searing attack on Hillary's 'far Left' politics, which is an absurd description of a campaign desperate to roll back on as much radicalism as it can between now and November. The upshot is that each is now biting and scratching like Brooklyn alley cats. Hillary should win, and probably will - the Democrats are gloating over the abyss in stature between Lazio and the First Lady - and while Lazio will fight with a smile, he will fight tough. And if he wins his victory would be the hardest blow of all to the precarious Clinton legacy. Indeed, everyone in New York and beyond thought that the Clinton v Giuliani heavyweight bout would be the political equivalent to Clay v Liston. If so, Clinton v Lazio will be more like Fight Club, no rules and nasty.

      "body": "<p>When Hansie Cronje walked into the King Commission last week to face claims that he was at the centre of corruption in world cricket, the confident stride of a winning captain had given way to a hesitant shuffle. Gone was his trademark grim-faced but determined look. He entered, a man who had grasped temptation and was now walking under the floodlights of global humiliation. </p> <p>In Cape Town's Centre for the Book, a cramped library, his demeanour was as dark as his moral gloom since his five-year flirtation with bookmakers and the illicit world of gambling was exposed just over two months ago. Never verbally forthcoming, the closest glimpse into the mind of South Africa's most successful captain was his painful understatement: 'Words cannot begin to describe the shame, humiliation and pain I feel in the knowledge that I have inflicted this on others. To my wife, family and team-mates, in particular, I apologise.' </p> <p>For the normally unemotional Cronje, it was a remarkable transformation. Here was a man who was once the epitome of diplomatic impartiality, always neutral in his language. On the field, there was an edge, he was always tense - always the responsible one who, it seemed, could win games by sheer willpower. But last Thursday he was a picture of misery and humility. </p> <p>Although he read out a damning confession, he maintained a strict coolness. The most emotional moment of his fall from grace had happened behind the scenes. It was on the morning of 11 April that the scandal broke: shortly after 2am Cronje addressed a handwritten letter to his pastor, Ray McCauley. </p> <p>Referring to the approaches of bookmakers and the eventual temptation that he succumbed to, he said: 'When Satan comes knocking on the door, always keep your eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ and ask him to protect you from any wrong. The moment I took my eyes off Jesus, the whole world turned dark and it felt like someone had stuck a knife through my chest.' </p> <p>When Indian police charged Cronje with cheating, fraud and conspiracy nine weeks ago nobody could have imagined the tawdry story about to unfold. Cronje's sordid confessions, laced with biblical references, have left South Africans at a loss to unravel the complex character of the most successful captain in Springbok cricketing history. </p> <p>A once unblemished character in the eyes of an adoring nation, Cronje was a 'reborn' Christian who turned to God after accidentally killing a little girl who had darted in front of his car as he was travelling to Empangeni in Zululand for a provincial game in the early 1990s. After that day, he says, he has never allowed himself to shy away from his moral responsibility. </p> <p>In his testimony last week he was quick to take all the blame himself. 'The greatest honour which can be bestowed upon any cricketer is to lead his country's national side. I have failed in my moral and professional duties.' Of his attempts to get his team-mates Herschelle Gibbs and Henry Williams to lie about the $15,000 he offered them to underperform in a one-day international against India, he said: 'I hoped to save them from the predicament in which I had placed them: instead I compromised them and worsened their position.' </p> <p>For a broken man, who stands to lose all his income as well as his reputation, he insisted: 'My only consolation is the knowledge that, despite my inexcusable behaviour, South Africa has in fact never thrown or fixed a match.' </p> <p>It is small comfort for a man who, until his fall from grace, had been too good to be true. Part of a minor cricketing dynasty - his father also played for South Africa - in the Afrikaner hinterland of the Orange Free State, Cronje made his provincial debut in 1987 at the age of 18. </p> <p>By the age of 21 he was captain, before being selected for the national team at the age of 23. Two years later he was the team's regular captain. </p> <p>But the Cronje story has many twists in it. The 'legend version' has it that Cronje was a symbol of the Afrikaner's journey out of the laager of apartheid isolation to the brave new world of internationalism, a post-apartheid hero for those still struggling to cast off the shackles of an apartheid mindset. But he was also an irritable adversary whose thirst for a win bordered on the fanatical. </p> <p>In 1998 the Australian press all but called him a cheat after television footage showed him rolling the ball under his studded foot during a one-day international (players are not allowed to tamper with the ball or alter its shape). No official action was taken. During the same tour Cronje caused a stir when he hurled a stump through the door of the umpires' changing room after his side had lost a Test match they should have won in Adelaide. </p> <p>It has been widely acknowledged that he stormed out of a meeting two years ago with Ali Bacher, the head of South Africa's United Cricket Board (UCB). When Bacher, who has striven to restore South Africa's credibility after decades of anti-apartheid boycotts, suggested the quota system proposed by the government to get more black players in the team should at least be tried, Cronje was defiantly opposed. He argued that Test players should be picked solely on merit. </p> <p>The two were at loggerheads again last week. Cronje backtracked on Bacher's statement to the King investigation that Cronje had accepted between $10,000 and $15,000. He later recanted, but insisted he had not done anything to damage South Africa's reputation, nor had any of his team-mates. Amid the fall-out a simple question remains. Why did he do it? </p> <p>There is a theory that Cronje has fallen on his sword for the good of his fellow-accused. This might be the case. He has, it is true, taken full responsibility himself. But he has done so reluctantly, flushed out by media insistence and without the fulsome explanation that the doubters still demand. He said as much himself, referring to Herschelle Gibbs and Henry Williams. </p> <p>'It would be a tragedy if any of these players were to be lost to South African cricket because of my wrongdoing. I beg the commission and the cricketing authorities not to deprive the game of their talents and beg the UCB to reinstate both Herschelle and Henry to the national squad. Herschelle lied to the UCB, his employer, at my request. Herschelle, forgive me.' </p> <p>Was Cronje almost a victim of circumstances - led on by mysterious forces which confused an otherwise first-rate player and religious man? Perhaps. Cronje himself has complained that pressure from bookmakers to throw matches was intolerable. Hundreds of offers were received from a string of bookies. In all, he says he accepted nearly $100,000 while turning away a further $620,000. Not nearly what he earns a year through his cricket contract and lucrative sponsorships. </p> <p>In one episode Cronje recalled how a London book-maker called Sanjay gave him a cellphone box filled with US dollars in exchange for match information. Cronje said he had not counted the cash, which he kept at home in a filing cabinet with other money. While on tour in India in March and April last year, he was repeatedly pressed by Sanjay to fix results. </p> <p>'The pressure was heavy...calls would come through to my room as late as two and three o'clock in the morning. 'I had taken money from Sanjay and it became increasingly difficult to resist his requests to...manipulate results.' Initially he held firm but later agreed to try to fix a game in Nagpur for $80,000. 'Since that day, in a moment of stupidity and weakness, I allowed Satan and the world to dictate terms to me, rather than the Lord. Bookmakers were calling me almost four times a day from then on.' </p> <p>As for Cronje himself, he has a simple answer to the question of why he fell in with the bookies. He did it for 'greed' - pure and simple. Taking cash off bookmakers was 'an easy way to make money', he told the King commission last week. Cronje first took cash during a tour of India in 1996 when, he alleged, former Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin introduced him to a bookie or gambler called Mukesh Gupta, known as MK. </p> <p>'MK asked if we would give wickets away on the last of the Test to ensure that we lost,' said Cronje, who added that he never spoke to any of the players about this, but South Africa lost the match anyway. 'I had effectively received money for doing nothing,' he said. 'I thought I could keep the money without having to influence anything. But it became obvious that I had got myself into a situation which was going to be very difficult to get out of.' </p> <p>Cronje was greedy, corruptible, dim and calculating. He was also vulnerable, indecisive and naive. In his case the combination was curiously combustible. Whatever the truth behind the downfall of an Afrikaner legend, he is, in the eyes of much of the South African public, a hero. The more he is flogged, the more he is loved. </p> <p>An opinion poll by the Star newspaper in Johannesburg found that 94 per cent of respondents supported Cronje and/or believed he was innocent. Callers to radio stations were equally vocal in their belief that, even if Hansie had erred, he should be forgiven. Perhaps this is the proper Christian response. Truth and reconciliation, Nelson Mandela called it.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The chaotic state of Bihar confirmed its reputation as the most lawless place in India yesterday when gunmen from a private army massacred at least 34 villagers in a bloody caste feud.</p> <p>The black-clad gunmen descended on the village of Miapur early yesterday. They dragged villagers from their beds, lined them up and mowed them down with automatic weapons.</p> <p>The victims were mainly members of the lower-caste Yadav. They included six children aged between five and eight. Twenty-two people died immediately and the rest later, intelligence officials in Patna, Bihar's capital, said yesterday. Eighteen were injured, 10 critically.</p> <p>Detectives last night said the attack was carried out by the Ranvir Sena, a banned upper-caste landlord army whose murderous six-year feud with left-wing groups representing the lower castes has turned Bihar into a killing field. This latest massacre was the eighth major caste-related attack in the past six months. So far this month, 44 people have died.</p> <p>Though no group claimed responsibility for the Miapur massacre, it is believed to be a Ranvir Sena revenge attack following the murder of 11 upper-caste villagers last Sunday.</p> <p>Miapur, a remote off-road settlement, is only six miles away from Senari, where the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) party slaughtered 34 of the upper Bhumihar caste in March last year.</p> <p>'The situation in the village is very tense, with villagers complaining that, despite complaints to the local police that there might be attacks, no preventative measures were taken,' Manish Kumar, a reporter with Star TV, said yesterday.</p> <p>About 400 police poured into Miapur yesterday, only to find that survivors were refusing to release the bodies of the dead until Bihar's Chief Minister, Rabri Devi, visited. Devi later arrived at the scene with her husband, Laloo Prasad Yadav, India's most notorious politician, who ran the state until forced out by corruption scandals and appointed his wife successor. Yadav, who emerged from poverty to be a champion of the lower castes, promised a government job to each family affected by the tragedy and ex-gratia payments of \u00a31,500 per victim.</p> <p>The massacre is set to plunge Bihar into violent political turmoil again. Last year a series of caste-related killings prompted India's Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to try direct federal rule. But his proposal failed to get enough votes in parliament because it was not supported by the Congress party, the main partner in Bihar's coalition government. Congress is reconsidering its position following the latest killings.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The chaotic state of Bihar confirmed its reputation as the most lawless place in India yesterday when gunmen from a private army massacred at least 34 villagers in a bloody caste feud. The black-clad gunmen descended on the village of Miapur early yesterday. They dragged villagers from their beds, lined them up and mowed them down with automatic weapons. The victims were mainly members of the lower-caste Yadav. They included six children aged between five and eight. Twenty-two people died immediately and the rest later, intelligence officials in Patna, Bihar's capital, said yesterday. Eighteen were injured, 10 critically. Detectives last night said the attack was carried out by the Ranvir Sena, a banned upper-caste landlord army whose murderous six-year feud with left-wing groups representing the lower castes has turned Bihar into a killing field. This latest massacre was the eighth major caste-related attack in the past six months. So far this month, 44 people have died. Though no group claimed responsibility for the Miapur massacre, it is believed to be a Ranvir Sena revenge attack following the murder of 11 upper-caste villagers last Sunday. Miapur, a remote off-road settlement, is only six miles away from Senari, where the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) party slaughtered 34 of the upper Bhumihar caste in March last year. 'The situation in the village is very tense, with villagers complaining that, despite complaints to the local police that there might be attacks, no preventative measures were taken,' Manish Kumar, a reporter with Star TV, said yesterday. About 400 police poured into Miapur yesterday, only to find that survivors were refusing to release the bodies of the dead until Bihar's Chief Minister, Rabri Devi, visited. Devi later arrived at the scene with her husband, Laloo Prasad Yadav, India's most notorious politician, who ran the state until forced out by corruption scandals and appointed his wife successor. Yadav, who emerged from poverty to be a champion of the lower castes, promised a government job to each family affected by the tragedy and ex-gratia payments of \u00a31,500 per victim. The massacre is set to plunge Bihar into violent political turmoil again. Last year a series of caste-related killings prompted India's Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to try direct federal rule. But his proposal failed to get enough votes in parliament because it was not supported by the Congress party, the main partner in Bihar's coalition government. Congress is reconsidering its position following the latest killings.",

It is hard to say what smells worse - the unwashed, drunken, beaten soldiers or the rotting vegetation all around.</p> <p>This is the road to Mile 91. It stretches like a raw, red weal through the drab green jungle and swamp of central western Sierra Leone. To the North and East lie the ill-defined front line and rebel territory. To the South and West is land that the government and the United Nations, bolstered by the British armed intervention of four weeks ago, claim to control.</p> <p>The British combat troops have now gone. The last Royal Marines have climbed aboard their helicopters. In a few days they will be in the bars of Tenerife. Two hundred men of the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Anglian Regiment have stayed on to train government troops. A few score specialists remain to advise the local government and armed forces on how to prosecute the war against the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) - the rebels who hold half the country and its crucial diamond fields.</p> <p>Last Thursday John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, sipped tea with the Sierra Leone President, Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, in Freetown, the picturesque capital, and restated the UK's long-term commitment to turning the West African state - a former British colony and now probably the poorest country in the world - into a stable, prosperous democracy. He sounded sure it would happen.</p> <p>The UN spokesmen were equally optimistic. But hopeful words cannot hide the horror of the situation in Sierra Leone. This weekend the blithe assurances of the politicians, the British Army and the motley collection of UN 'peacekeepers' are looking increasingly unrealistic.</p> <p>In the past three days the rebels have launched a dozen or more assaults on the UN and government positions. The UN dismiss the strikes as 'probing attacks' and the British military say the rebels have received a 'bloody nose'. But the highly mobile RUF is striking, seemingly at will, deep into 'government-held' territory. Though they have yet to inflict casualties, they have forced the government forces on to the back foot; 230 peacekeepers - and a British officer - are still surrounded by the rebels and key objectives remain unsecured. In fact, a glance at the map shows that Freetown's forces are barely holding on to the territory they recaptured following the arrival of British troops five weeks ago.</p> <p>The RUF's grip on its diamonds, the lifeblood of the movement, is unthreatened. There have even been armed clashes between the disparate factions that make up the government forces. Though the UN and the British downplay them as 'ongoing squabbles', the most recent - on Thursday night - seriously rattled senior officers. Privately they admit that the cohesion of Freetown's forces is a grave concern.</p> <p>Deep in the jungle, the most nightmarish of all scenarios is unfolding. It is estimated that more than 100,000 refugees have been displaced by the recent fighting. Many are without food and shelter. These are people who have watched close relatives raped and hatcheted to death, who have had their houses burnt down around them, who have survived for days on roots and mangoes.</p> <p>Help will not come soon. A bid by the World Food Programme to distribute aid last week at a town only 30 miles from the vital Lungi airport was halted by an RUF attack. Aid workers describe the situation as 'an emergency' and speak of 'famine' potential.</p> <p>This is a country where 12-year-old children carry British-issued automatic rifles, where barely pubescent girls talk of the men they have killed, where aid workers need a helicopter gunship flown by a South African mercenary to evacuate them when the UN retreat during a rebel attack, where for the price of a grilled chicken dinner women sell themselves on a beach as helicopters wheel overhead and Bob Marley pumps from a blaring jukebox. It is difficult to see much light in this darkness.</p> <p>Thirty-five miles inland from Freetown is the town of Masiaka - a cluster of shacks and rotting, colonial-style villas. The government forces mass here before going up to the front. There are the official government soldiers in their newly issued British uniforms and weapons, the Kamajor irregular militia festooned with plastic charms, mirrors and conch shells and rumours of cannibalism, Gbenthi bushmen armed with hunting rifles and spiked clubs. One old bungalow, its colonnades rotten, mildewed and pocked with bullet scars, serves as the headquarters of the 'West Side Niggahz' - the name has been sanitised by the authorities to the 'West Side Boys'.</p> <p>Smoking cannabis and sucking 'gin popsicles' - fiercely alcoholic ice lollies - the fighters loll in rotten armchairs with rocket launchers and machine guns scattered around them. A bucket of potent palm wine lies empty but for a few cloudy dregs. Bullet belts gleam dully in the flat afternoon light.</p> <p>Just over a year ago these fighters joined the RUF in 'Operation No Living Thing' and raped, burnt and looted their way through Freetown. President Kabbah fled. Now they are fighting on the government side and, for the moment, have restricted their criminal activities to stealing British-supplied weapons from their supposed comrades and extorting money at vehicle checkpoints. Last week there were two shoot-outs between the West Side Niggahz and government troops. No one doubts that more will come.</p> <p>The Observer visited Masiaka to watch the handover of 134 children who had been freed from the rebels. In the derelict school where they were housed they told their stories. The younger ones, some only five or six, had been camp-followers, washing clothes and fetching firewood for the soldiers. But many of the older children were fighters.</p> <p>Mariana Mansaray, 15 and wearing a blue gingham shirt and green skirt, was one. A facial tic and appalling stammer made it virtually impossible for her to talk. Slowly and painfully, she told how she had been abducted by the rebels two years ago, repeatedly raped and then injected with some kind of drug. At first she had carried ammunition to the frontline troops but was soon in combat herself. 'They gave me drugs, sir,' she said with her entire jaw contorted into a rictus of pain as she tried to speak. 'Then I was fighting for them, sir.' How many people had she killed? Her neck muscles - standing out like steel cables - pulsed and spasmed before she choked out the answer. 'Plenty,' she said.</p> <p>Around her sat others with similar stories. One seven-year-old boy spoke of how his 25-year-old father had initiated him into the RUF by teaching him how to hack off arms - the rebels' calling card since their bid to stop people voting in Sierra Leone's 1996 election from which the RUF was banned. He was taught to ask if his victims wanted 'long' or 'short sleeves' - amputation above or below the elbow. Others spoke of watching their villages burn to the ground or how the rebels had killed their parents and then given them the stark choice: join up or die.</p> <p>A short distance from the old school a hundred or so government soldiers were piling on lorries to take them up to the front. Many were staggering drunk and waved their rifles and 'gin popsicles' in the air. One sucked on a joint and tried to blow the smoke into the mouth of the regimental mascot - a monkey.</p> <p>Their commander, Colonel Anthony Mansare, stood near by. 'High spirits are no problem,' he said. 'The rebels are all around, so we need to be motivated. They are fast, so we need to be faster.'</p> <p>Quite how easily the rebels could strike was shown later when, just a few miles away, a detachment of RUF in canoes attacked a Jordanian unit guarding a key bridge and, having been driven off, torched a local village. The Jordanians were at least 20 miles to the rear of the forward-most UN troops and 50 miles behind the front.</p> <p>Brigadier Gordon Hughes MBE is the commander of the British forces remaining in Sierra Leone. The largest detachment is based at Benguema - a small town astride the road the RUF took last month in its blitzkrieg advance that threatened the capital city and precipitated the British intervention. The Royal Anglians will be there for six weeks. 'They are ready for any eventuality and will defend their positions,' said Hughes, a tall, lean, earnest man. However, he was at pains to stress that their main role was training a thousand carefully screened troops to form the core of a new government army.</p> <p>Marching on Benguema camp's drill square the new recruits looked fit and motivated. There are fears, though, that their immediate impact on a 10-year-old war may be limited. 'We are here for the long term,' Hughes said. 'It could be weeks or months or years.'</p> <p>Spread out through Freetown are the headquarters of the various components of Unamsil - the United Nations Mission to Sierra Leone. The UN force is being brought up to its full strength of 13,000 and there are moves to provide another 3,500 troops and strengthen its mandate. There are the Jordanians and the Indians, but also Kenyans, Zambians, Pakistanis, Guineans, Bangladeshis and men from a dozen other countries. The key element are the battle-hardened Nigerians who last year drove the RUF and its allies out of Freetown to end a two-month-long occupation.</p> <p>In May, UN units fled in the face of the rebel advance, leaving weapons and even armoured personnel carriers behind. Now officers are sure that Unamsil will stand and fight. 'This is a test case for peacekeeping,' said one UN official. 'We can't afford to fail. The worry is that if we stay the course we will get sucked into a UN version of Vietnam.'</p> <p>Brigadier Hughes last week called on the RUF to 'give up the fight'. But few believe that the rebel leadership will heed his call even if their troops want them to. In recent weeks the rebels have suffered reverses: they been forced to abandon their recent gains and their leader, Foday Sankoh, has been captured. But the conditions that led to the creation of the RUF remain broadly unchanged.</p> <p>The movement burst on the scene in 1991, a few years after Sankoh and Charles Taylor, the current President of neighbouring Liberia, met in a Libyan training camp. When in 1990 Sierra Leonese forces came to the assistance of government troops fighting Taylor's brutal insurrection in Liberia, a scheme the two men had hatched while guests of Libya's Muammar Gadaffi was put into action.</p> <p>Sankoh launched the RUF, forcing Freetown to pull back its troops and allow Taylor to batter his way to power. The pay-off was the diamonds. The RUF seized the great mines in the south of Sierra Leone and Sankoh - made Minister for Minerals in return for a truce last year - split the multi-million-pound proceeds with his friend. Taylor has always ensured that the RUF has sufficient weaponry, mainly brought in from Eastern Europe.</p> <p>Now, with Sankoh in jail, radio intercepts reveal that the Liberian leader is actually directing the RUF's operations in person. 'Take away the diamonds and the RUF will collapse,' a senior British officer said briskly last week and though there are other factors - economic and ethnic - he was basically right.</p> <p>Pressure is slowly being brought to bear on Taylor. Last week the European Union blocked a \u00a333m aid package to his country - but no one expects the Liberian President, or his brutal proxies within Sierra Leone, to be denied the diamonds soon. And as long as the RUF has diamonds, Sierra Leone will have a war.</p> <p>From Masiaka the road to Mile 91 leads east - lined with wrecked vehicles and the shells of buildings destroyed in the various bouts of fighting that have racked the country in the past 10 years. The UN has said that it was unsafe but officials of the Red Cross agreed to take The Observer to see the scale of the unfolding humanitarian crisis. At almost every village refugees swarmed around aid distribution points, clamouring for a bucket, blankets and some plastic sheeting. A little flour and oil would come later from the World Food Programme. They all told similar stories. They could not stay at home because it was too dangerous.</p> <p>Most came from Lunsar, where fighting between government troops and the rebels has been raging for nearly two weeks. Others came from the town of Makena which, they said, was being sytematically levelled by the RUF. Kardiatu A. Kamara was typical. A 28-year-old teacher, she had left Lunsar a week ago to trek with her nine-strong family along jungle paths to reach a village close to Mile 91 where she had heard there was shelter. She was heavily pregnant, so the 30-mile trek had taken four days.</p> <p>'It was terrible,' she said. 'We dug wells for water and lived on [cassava] roots and leaves and some mangoes when we found them. The rebels took all our money and food and most of our clothes when we left our home. Now we have nothing.'</p> <p>Kamara said her 13-year-old brother was sick with 'swell-swell' - chronic infection caused by insect bites and lacerations sustained during the walk. His limbs and face were puffed up to twice normal size. She was afraid he would die. Many had lost relatives in recent days. In Mile 91 itself, Saidu Conteh, a 27-year-old fish trader, told The Observer that he had decided to flee after his 13-year-old sister and two brothers were killed by the rebels last Saturday.</p> <p>'I was hiding in my house under my bed when I heard my sister screaming in the road outside. The rebels had tied up my two brothers and were dragging my sister around by the hair. Then [the rebels] shot dead the boys, and told my sister they would kill her if she did not tell them where I was.'</p> <p>Conteh said he had listened as the rebels interrogated the girl. When she refused to reveal the whereabouts of the rest of her family, they gang-raped her and then held her down and hacked out her genitals with machetes and bayonets. Then they watched as she bled to death in the street. The family fled that night.</p> <p>Many of the refugees had not heard of the British involvement. 'Little news reaches us at our village,' said Issa Kanu, 16. 'Why are the British going away when they have only just arrived?'</p> <p>He said the war meant that his family's fields - the main source of income and sustenance - had gone unplanted. As they walked through the jungle they had glumly watched government army units retreating from positions around his home. 'Di future for di people is no' good,' he said in the lilting accents of Krio - the English-derived language spoken in much of Sierra Leone. 'An' it is goin' to get much worse before it get any better.'</p> <p>He looked up at the dark sky over Mile 91. The rainy season had only just begun, he said. 'Even the weather is still no way as bad as it is goin' to be.'</p> <p>The rain poured down around him. Guinean soldiers trudged past in rain capes and pink plastic sandals. A woman in a filthy, faded chequered dress tried to keep a failing fire alive to grill some shrivelled corn. At a shattered bus stand a group of young men waited, with red mud up their ankles and blank, despairing eyes, for a bus they knew wouldn't come.</p>",

One seven-year-old boy spoke of how his 25-year-old father had initiated him into the RUF by teaching him how to hack off arms - the rebels' calling card since their bid to stop people voting in Sierra Leone's 1996 election from which the RUF was banned. He was taught to ask if his victims wanted 'long' or 'short sleeves' - amputation above or below the elbow. Others spoke of watching their villages burn to the ground or how the rebels had killed their parents and then given them the stark choice: join up or die. A short distance from the old school a hundred or so government soldiers were piling on lorries to take them up to the front. Many were staggering drunk and waved their rifles and 'gin popsicles' in the air. One sucked on a joint and tried to blow the smoke into the mouth of the regimental mascot - a monkey. Their commander, Colonel Anthony Mansare, stood near by. 'High spirits are no problem,' he said. 'The rebels are all around, so we need to be motivated. They are fast, so we need to be faster.' Quite how easily the rebels could strike was shown later when, just a few miles away, a detachment of RUF in canoes attacked a Jordanian unit guarding a key bridge and, having been driven off, torched a local village. The Jordanians were at least 20 miles to the rear of the forward-most UN troops and 50 miles behind the front. Brigadier Gordon Hughes MBE is the commander of the British forces remaining in Sierra Leone. The largest detachment is based at Benguema - a small town astride the road the RUF took last month in its blitzkrieg advance that threatened the capital city and precipitated the British intervention. The Royal Anglians will be there for six weeks. 'They are ready for any eventuality and will defend their positions,' said Hughes, a tall, lean, earnest man. However, he was at pains to stress that their main role was training a thousand carefully screened troops to form the core of a new government army. Marching on Benguema camp's drill square the new recruits looked fit and motivated. There are fears, though, that their immediate impact on a 10-year-old war may be limited. 'We are here for the long term,' Hughes said. 'It could be weeks or months or years.' Spread out through Freetown are the headquarters of the various components of Unamsil - the United Nations Mission to Sierra Leone. The UN force is being brought up to its full strength of 13,000 and there are moves to provide another 3,500 troops and strengthen its mandate. There are the Jordanians and the Indians, but also Kenyans, Zambians, Pakistanis, Guineans, Bangladeshis and men from a dozen other countries. The key element are the battle-hardened Nigerians who last year drove the RUF and its allies out of Freetown to end a two-month-long occupation. In May, UN units fled in the face of the rebel advance, leaving weapons and even armoured personnel carriers behind. Now officers are sure that Unamsil will stand and fight. 'This is a test case for peacekeeping,' said one UN official. 'We can't afford to fail. The worry is that if we stay the course we will get sucked into a UN version of Vietnam.' Brigadier Hughes last week called on the RUF to 'give up the fight'. But few believe that the rebel leadership will heed his call even if their troops want them to. In recent weeks the rebels have suffered reverses: they been forced to abandon their recent gains and their leader, Foday Sankoh, has been captured. But the conditions that led to the creation of the RUF remain broadly unchanged. The movement burst on the scene in 1991, a few years after Sankoh and Charles Taylor, the current President of neighbouring Liberia, met in a Libyan training camp. When in 1990 Sierra Leonese forces came to the assistance of government troops fighting Taylor's brutal insurrection in Liberia, a scheme the two men had hatched while guests of Libya's Muammar Gadaffi was put into action. Sankoh launched the RUF, forcing Freetown to pull back its troops and allow Taylor to batter his way to power. The pay-off was the diamonds. The RUF seized the great mines in the south of Sierra Leone and Sankoh - made Minister for Minerals in return for a truce last year - split the multi-million-pound proceeds with his friend. Taylor has always ensured that the RUF has sufficient weaponry, mainly brought in from Eastern Europe. Now, with Sankoh in jail, radio intercepts reveal that the Liberian leader is actually directing the RUF's operations in person. 'Take away the diamonds and the RUF will collapse,' a senior British officer said briskly last week and though there are other factors - economic and ethnic - he was basically right. Pressure is slowly being brought to bear on Taylor. Last week the European Union blocked a \u00a333m aid package to his country - but no one expects the Liberian President, or his brutal proxies within Sierra Leone, to be denied the diamonds soon. And as long as the RUF has diamonds, Sierra Leone will have a war. From Masiaka the road to Mile 91 leads east - lined with wrecked vehicles and the shells of buildings destroyed in the various bouts of fighting that have racked the country in the past 10 years. The UN has said that it was unsafe but officials of the Red Cross agreed to take The Observer to see the scale of the unfolding humanitarian crisis. At almost every village refugees swarmed around aid distribution points, clamouring for a bucket, blankets and some plastic sheeting. A little flour and oil would come later from the World Food Programme. They all told similar stories. They could not stay at home because it was too dangerous. Most came from Lunsar, where fighting between government troops and the rebels has been raging for nearly two weeks. Others came from the town of Makena which, they said, was being sytematically levelled by the RUF. Kardiatu A. Kamara was typical. A 28-year-old teacher, she had left Lunsar a week ago to trek with her nine-strong family along jungle paths to reach a village close to Mile 91 where she had heard there was shelter. She was heavily pregnant, so the 30-mile trek had taken four days. 'It was terrible,' she said. 'We dug wells for water and lived on [cassava] roots and leaves and some mangoes when we found them. The rebels took all our money and food and most of our clothes when we left our home. Now we have nothing.' Kamara said her 13-year-old brother was sick with 'swell-swell' - chronic infection caused by insect bites and lacerations sustained during the walk. His limbs and face were puffed up to twice normal size. She was afraid he would die. Many had lost relatives in recent days. In Mile 91 itself, Saidu Conteh, a 27-year-old fish trader, told The Observer that he had decided to flee after his 13-year-old sister and two brothers were killed by the rebels last Saturday. 'I was hiding in my house under my bed when I heard my sister screaming in the road outside. The rebels had tied up my two brothers and were dragging my sister around by the hair. Then [the rebels] shot dead the boys, and told my sister they would kill her if she did not tell them where I was.' Conteh said he had listened as the rebels interrogated the girl. When she refused to reveal the whereabouts of the rest of her family, they gang-raped her and then held her down and hacked out her genitals with machetes and bayonets. Then they watched as she bled to death in the street. The family fled that night. Many of the refugees had not heard of the British involvement. 'Little news reaches us at our village,' said Issa Kanu, 16. 'Why are the British going away when they have only just arrived?' He said the war meant that his family's fields - the main source of income and sustenance - had gone unplanted. As they walked through the jungle they had glumly watched government army units retreating from positions around his home. 'Di future for di people is no' good,' he said in the lilting accents of Krio - the English-derived language spoken in much of Sierra Leone. 'An' it is goin' to get much worse before it get any better.' He looked up at the dark sky over Mile 91. The rainy season had only just begun, he said. 'Even the weather is still no way as bad as it is goin' to be.' The rain poured down around him. Guinean soldiers trudged past in rain capes and pink plastic sandals. A woman in a filthy, faded chequered dress tried to keep a failing fire alive to grill some shrivelled corn. At a shattered bus stand a group of young men waited, with red mud up their ankles and blank, despairing eyes, for a bus they knew wouldn't come.",

Police say it is an exercise to reduce armed crime. Many say the government is flexing its muscles before next weekend's parliamentary elections.</p> <p>But not all the officers are hostile. The policeman checking my bag ruefully agrees that prices are far too high because of Zimbabwe's 60 per cent inflation. 'It's time for a change,' he says in a low voice, implicitly endorsing the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).</p> <p>Despite the Mugabe regime's blatant use of violence, electoral fraud and misuse of the police force, the impetus for change appears to be unstoppable. An opinion poll released on Friday says the MDC will win 70 of the 120 elected parliamentary seats.</p> <p>The elections are the most important since the 1980 vote which brought majority rule. The choice is between Robert Mugabe's government, which promotes violence, murder and mayhem, and the MDC, which calls for respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p> <p>Public support for the MDC is palpable. That is why the government is using every trick in the book. These include making the police force accomplices to the political violence that has racked the country. Government officials say the elections will be free and fair. But all objective observers agree that this is impossible.</p> <p>Police commissioner Augustine Chihuri asserted last week: 'Political violence is being over-publicised by the media. The violence that has characterised this election is common in other countries.'</p> <p>That was rich, coming from the man responsible for preventing the police from taking action against the illegal farm invasions, from stopping violence against opposition supporters and from arresting known murderers.</p> <p>The argument that Zimbabwe's pre-election violence is acceptable in comparison with more serious violence in other African countries is a line of reasoning articulated by Mugabe and parroted by several Cabinet Ministers. But Zimbabwe's violence is different and much more objectionable because it has been sponsored by the government itself.</p> <p>Trevor Ncube, editor of the Zimbabwe Independent, says: 'At least 30 Zimbabweans have been murdered in cold blood and many more raped and assaulted for their political beliefs while the police have stood by with arms folded. Whatever they do from now until the election, I doubt they will ever recover from the damage their partisan role has done to their reputation and image.'</p> <p>But not all support Mugabe. A group of senior police officers revealed their unhappiness to the independent Daily News . They are dismayed by the failure of police to prosecute the killers of MDC members Tichaona Chiminya and Talent Mabhika, who died when their vehicle was firebombed in Buhera in April.</p> <p>They are also disgusted that police have not arrested the men who killed white farmer David Stevens, another MDC member. 'Chiminya's vehicle was petrol-bombed in the presence of the police. Stevens was dragged out of a police station by his killers,' said one of the police officers. 'Police know who those killers are yet no one has been arrested or charged.'</p> <p>The disillusioned officers say the farm invasions have created a climate of lawlessness, giving rise to increased numbers of armed robberies and carjackings. Although Mugabe has ordered police not to take action against the farm invaders, the officers say that, according to the Police Act, the police are not supposed to obey an unlawful order no matter who issues it.</p> <p>Since the February referendum 300 officers have been transferred, accused of being MDC sympathisers. Inspector Patrick Mashayamombe, police chief in the eastern border town of Chimanimani, was moved to a junior position in Mutare for allegedly sympathising with the MDC. He is the officer credited with restoring order in Chimanimani after Zanu-PF supporters rampaged through the town last month. 'Morale in the police is really low,' said one officer. 'Some of us feel really bad. We can see people breaking the law, committing murders, political violence and farm invasions.'</p> <p>The police charge that the Central Intelligence Organisation, run from Mugabe's offices, has issued weapons to Zanu-PF supporters and many of these are being used in a spate of armed robberies. This is especially worrying because of threats that the country will be returned to war if the ruling party loses the elections.</p> <p>'This country was won through the loss of blood and not elections,' said Edmore Harare, a veteran leader in the Masvingo and Midlands provinces. 'Even if other people accept the results, we will not. We are married to this country and Mugabe. We are going to support Mugabe until we bury him.'</p> <p>The emasculation of the police force has created a feeling of insecurity. For short-term gains, Mugabe has wrought long-term damage on the country's once proud police force.</p>",

The policeman checking my bag ruefully agrees that prices are far too high because of Zimbabwe's 60 per cent inflation. 'It's time for a change,' he says in a low voice, implicitly endorsing the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Despite the Mugabe regime's blatant use of violence, electoral fraud and misuse of the police force, the impetus for change appears to be unstoppable. An opinion poll released on Friday says the MDC will win 70 of the 120 elected parliamentary seats. The elections are the most important since the 1980 vote which brought majority rule. The choice is between Robert Mugabe's government, which promotes violence, murder and mayhem, and the MDC, which calls for respect for human rights and the rule of law. Public support for the MDC is palpable. That is why the government is using every trick in the book. These include making the police force accomplices to the political violence that has racked the country. Government officials say the elections will be free and fair. But all objective observers agree that this is impossible. Police commissioner Augustine Chihuri asserted last week: 'Political violence is being over-publicised by the media. The violence that has characterised this election is common in other countries.' That was rich, coming from the man responsible for preventing the police from taking action against the illegal farm invasions, from stopping violence against opposition supporters and from arresting known murderers. The argument that Zimbabwe's pre-election violence is acceptable in comparison with more serious violence in other African countries is a line of reasoning articulated by Mugabe and parroted by several Cabinet Ministers. But Zimbabwe's violence is different and much more objectionable because it has been sponsored by the government itself. Trevor Ncube, editor of the Zimbabwe Independent, says: 'At least 30 Zimbabweans have been murdered in cold blood and many more raped and assaulted for their political beliefs while the police have stood by with arms folded. Whatever they do from now until the election, I doubt they will ever recover from the damage their partisan role has done to their reputation and image.' But not all support Mugabe. A group of senior police officers revealed their unhappiness to the independent Daily News . They are dismayed by the failure of police to prosecute the killers of MDC members Tichaona Chiminya and Talent Mabhika, who died when their vehicle was firebombed in Buhera in April. They are also disgusted that police have not arrested the men who killed white farmer David Stevens, another MDC member. 'Chiminya's vehicle was petrol-bombed in the presence of the police. Stevens was dragged out of a police station by his killers,' said one of the police officers. 'Police know who those killers are yet no one has been arrested or charged.' The disillusioned officers say the farm invasions have created a climate of lawlessness, giving rise to increased numbers of armed robberies and carjackings. Although Mugabe has ordered police not to take action against the farm invaders, the officers say that, according to the Police Act, the police are not supposed to obey an unlawful order no matter who issues it. Since the February referendum 300 officers have been transferred, accused of being MDC sympathisers. Inspector Patrick Mashayamombe, police chief in the eastern border town of Chimanimani, was moved to a junior position in Mutare for allegedly sympathising with the MDC. He is the officer credited with restoring order in Chimanimani after Zanu-PF supporters rampaged through the town last month. 'Morale in the police is really low,' said one officer. 'Some of us feel really bad. We can see people breaking the law, committing murders, political violence and farm invasions.' The police charge that the Central Intelligence Organisation, run from Mugabe's offices, has issued weapons to Zanu-PF supporters and many of these are being used in a spate of armed robberies. This is especially worrying because of threats that the country will be returned to war if the ruling party loses the elections. 'This country was won through the loss of blood and not elections,' said Edmore Harare, a veteran leader in the Masvingo and Midlands provinces. 'Even if other people accept the results, we will not. We are married to this country and Mugabe. We are going to support Mugabe until we bury him.' The emasculation of the police force has created a feeling of insecurity. For short-term gains, Mugabe has wrought long-term damage on the country's once proud police force.",

Thousands of curious Lebanese, many of whom never ventured near the South during almost 20 years of occupation, are swarming around the ancient ramparts of the medieval fortress along with the other 100-odd Israeli and South Lebanon Army positions that stretch from the Mediterranean to the Golan Heights. But their journey to places such as Beaufort, which is situated on a mountain top where Crusaders once resisted the besieging armies of Saladin, contains a lethal threat - landmines. According to UN peacekeepers, the Israelis and their client SLA militia have left an estimated 70,000 anti-personnel mines in and around their abandoned compounds, including the castle. Last week, a young boy from Sidon was killed while visiting a deserted SLA stronghold that fell to the Iranian-backed Hizbollah during Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon on 22 May. The child was foraging for souvenirs in the compound when he spotted a camera. The camera turned out to be a booby trap left by the SLA before they fled into Israel. In the areas controlled by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) peacekeeping troops are trying to clear mines and unexploded ordnance that rained on South Lebanon like confetti for two decades. On Tuesday, I paced nervously through a field behind a home in Rashaf village, close to the Israeli border. In front was Commandant John Phelan, an Irish bomb disposal officer, who was preparing to blow up an unexploded 120mm mortar bomb discovered by a farmer.

      "body": "<p>The Home Office has a new sneer for those who question its assault on rights to do everything from protest to be tried by juries. In the past, we have been Old Labour 'dinosaurs' ignorant of the authoritarian necessities of hard times. Without contradiction, we then metamorphosed into 'woolly Hampstead liberals' despite our inability to afford a broom cupboard in Hampstead. For a brief, marvellous moment the most cynical of politicians decided their critics were 'cynics' for refusing to endorse their cynicism. Perhaps they heard the howls of hollow laughter. Perhaps they thought there ought to be a connection, however faint, between words and the phenomena they purport to describe. For whatever reason, Jack Straw has ruled that all who regard him as a public menace will henceforth be known as 'paranoids'. </p> <p>The cause of the linguistic shift is the reaction to the extraordinary Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill, currently before Parliament. The Government is proposing to give itself, the secret police, honest police, and indeed, each and every civil servant, the power to bug the phones, cars, homes, pagers, emails and internet use. Warrants to intercept will not be issued by a judge, but by Ministers. The law will thus place spies above the rule of the law courts. </p> <p>Liberty and other human rights groups have been banging on about the threat of uncontrolled surveillance for months. Because they represent paranoid/liberal/Old Labour/cynics they were ignored by most MPs. Last week, however, the issue took off. Simon Davies, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics and the director of Privacy International, estimated that the Government's insistence that internet service providers fit black boxes so MI5 can monitor what their customers are reading and writing may cost Britain \u00a346 billion as hi-tech companies conclude that a country demanding the right to pry without independent checks wasn't a safe place to do business in. </p> <p>The Financial Times hyper-ventilated. The state was demanding powers 'that Joseph Stalin would have used with relish', it cried. The British Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Electronic Industries went wild. Stephen Byers 'forcefully' conveyed their concerns to Straw. All Blair's chirping about ebusiness leading Britain into a century of opulent gee-whizzery suddenly had a tinny ring. </p> <p>It's great to have the FT and its readers on side. But to be fair to Straw - this notebook's raison d'etre - he is merely imitating business. What is truly frightening is the ability of private and public power to stare into corners. </p> <p>Millions leave democratic society behind when they go to work. The technologies which nerdish boosters claim are bringing choice and freedom are putting powers to invigilate in the hands of managers, as well as policemen, beyond the imagination of Henry Ford. If the Government is reading emails and monitoring website hits, then so are employers. Last year, to quote one of many examples, five workers at Rolls-Royce in Bristol were fired and 10 more were punished after a search of messages found that dirty pictures had been emailed from its workstations. </p> <p>You might argue that nudes are deplorable and the upright have nothing to fear; just as Straw argues that people who use the internet only to read material MI5 approves of have no reason to trouble their silly little heads about his bill. Yet at Rolls-Royce staff were disciplined for sending gossip on company time as well as the odd bit of filth and the firm ignored the sale of porn mags in its site shop. And if Straw is interested only in capturing criminals why does he refuse to allow judges to rule if invasions of privacy are tolerable? </p> <p>Reassurances that the innocent have no reason to fret also miss the psychological effect of knowing you're being watched. The next time you surf the net and hit a sex or radical site by mistake, will you feel someone or some computer has logged your interest? </p> <p>If you don't have a terminal, what about your phone? Mohamed al-Fayed became notorious for bugging staff at Harrod's who complained to union representatives about his sexism and racism. Ali F may be a bully and buffoon, but there's nothing exceptional about him. A study by Davies's Privacy International found that 200,000 bugs a year are sold quite legally in Britain. The most sophisticated - Direct Intelligence Access Listening (DIAL) systems - are powered off the telephone line and can run without maintenance for years. Crispin Sturrack, who works for the security consultants Cope Whiterock, described DIAL and its rivals thus: 'These things are getting smaller and cheaper by the day. And our job is made harder because they are now almost undetectable and unrecognisable.' </p> <p>As with bugs, so with cameras. The current issue of Index on Censorship is sobering reading for anyone who believes the knowledge economy nurtures freedom. It details how Britain spends more on CCTV surveillance than any other European country (\u00a3385 million last year). New digital cameras can link faces and number plates to data banks of targets' images and the Driver and Vehicle Licencing Centre's records and, indeed, be programmed to track mugs and cars. The soothing Straws say if you're not a criminal you've nothing to worry about. CCTV is a deterrent. They ignore the push to produce lenses that can be hidden without the surveyed knowing they're there to deter. Cameras 42mm square which can see in virtual darkness cost \u00a3100. </p> <p>We must ask what happens when people realise they have good reason for suspecting they can be tracked at work and on the streets? It's not as if the monitors are interested only in crime prevention or malingering. Spying has always attracted creeps. Chris Norris and Gary Armstrong, lecturers at Hull and Reading Universities, got into CCTV centres and saw police voyeurs getting their thrills watching, but not arresting, prostitutes at work. </p> <p>Soon every employee will have to produce a copy of his or her criminal record. A survey by the Metropolitan Police found that 86 per cent of records were wrong and many mistakes were so bad the alleged criminals could sue. More than a million workplace drug tests were conducted last year as body searches without a warrant became the fashion. Straw will extend mass sampling to police stations. You might think you're not at risk if you're clean, but checks in Ontario found 40 per cent of tests were inaccurate. A drug test means urinating in front of a manager, police officer or medic (who has to certify the right piss has been taken). Isn't this a public humiliation?

      "bodyText": "The Home Office has a new sneer for those who question its assault on rights to do everything from protest to be tried by juries. In the past, we have been Old Labour 'dinosaurs' ignorant of the authoritarian necessities of hard times. Without contradiction, we then metamorphosed into 'woolly Hampstead liberals' despite our inability to afford a broom cupboard in Hampstead. For a brief, marvellous moment the most cynical of politicians decided their critics were 'cynics' for refusing to endorse their cynicism. Perhaps they heard the howls of hollow laughter. Perhaps they thought there ought to be a connection, however faint, between words and the phenomena they purport to describe. For whatever reason, Jack Straw has ruled that all who regard him as a public menace will henceforth be known as 'paranoids'. The cause of the linguistic shift is the reaction to the extraordinary Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill, currently before Parliament. The Government is proposing to give itself, the secret police, honest police, and indeed, each and every civil servant, the power to bug the phones, cars, homes, pagers, emails and internet use. Warrants to intercept will not be issued by a judge, but by Ministers. The law will thus place spies above the rule of the law courts. Liberty and other human rights groups have been banging on about the threat of uncontrolled surveillance for months. Because they represent paranoid/liberal/Old Labour/cynics they were ignored by most MPs. Last week, however, the issue took off. Simon Davies, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics and the director of Privacy International, estimated that the Government's insistence that internet service providers fit black boxes so MI5 can monitor what their customers are reading and writing may cost Britain \u00a346 billion as hi-tech companies conclude that a country demanding the right to pry without independent checks wasn't a safe place to do business in. The Financial Times hyper-ventilated. The state was demanding powers 'that Joseph Stalin would have used with relish', it cried. The British Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Electronic Industries went wild. Stephen Byers 'forcefully' conveyed their concerns to Straw. All Blair's chirping about ebusiness leading Britain into a century of opulent gee-whizzery suddenly had a tinny ring. It's great to have the FT and its readers on side. But to be fair to Straw - this notebook's raison d'etre - he is merely imitating business. What is truly frightening is the ability of private and public power to stare into corners. Millions leave democratic society behind when they go to work. The technologies which nerdish boosters claim are bringing choice and freedom are putting powers to invigilate in the hands of managers, as well as policemen, beyond the imagination of Henry Ford. If the Government is reading emails and monitoring website hits, then so are employers. Last year, to quote one of many examples, five workers at Rolls-Royce in Bristol were fired and 10 more were punished after a search of messages found that dirty pictures had been emailed from its workstations. You might argue that nudes are deplorable and the upright have nothing to fear; just as Straw argues that people who use the internet only to read material MI5 approves of have no reason to trouble their silly little heads about his bill. Yet at Rolls-Royce staff were disciplined for sending gossip on company time as well as the odd bit of filth and the firm ignored the sale of porn mags in its site shop. And if Straw is interested only in capturing criminals why does he refuse to allow judges to rule if invasions of privacy are tolerable? Reassurances that the innocent have no reason to fret also miss the psychological effect of knowing you're being watched. The next time you surf the net and hit a sex or radical site by mistake, will you feel someone or some computer has logged your interest? If you don't have a terminal, what about your phone? Mohamed al-Fayed became notorious for bugging staff at Harrod's who complained to union representatives about his sexism and racism. Ali F may be a bully and buffoon, but there's nothing exceptional about him. A study by Davies's Privacy International found that 200,000 bugs a year are sold quite legally in Britain. The most sophisticated - Direct Intelligence Access Listening (DIAL) systems - are powered off the telephone line and can run without maintenance for years. Crispin Sturrack, who works for the security consultants Cope Whiterock, described DIAL and its rivals thus: 'These things are getting smaller and cheaper by the day. And our job is made harder because they are now almost undetectable and unrecognisable.' As with bugs, so with cameras. The current issue of Index on Censorship is sobering reading for anyone who believes the knowledge economy nurtures freedom. It details how Britain spends more on CCTV surveillance than any other European country (\u00a3385 million last year). New digital cameras can link faces and number plates to data banks of targets' images and the Driver and Vehicle Licencing Centre's records and, indeed, be programmed to track mugs and cars. The soothing Straws say if you're not a criminal you've nothing to worry about. CCTV is a deterrent. They ignore the push to produce lenses that can be hidden without the surveyed knowing they're there to deter. Cameras 42mm square which can see in virtual darkness cost \u00a3100. We must ask what happens when people realise they have good reason for suspecting they can be tracked at work and on the streets? It's not as if the monitors are interested only in crime prevention or malingering. Spying has always attracted creeps. Chris Norris and Gary Armstrong, lecturers at Hull and Reading Universities, got into CCTV centres and saw police voyeurs getting their thrills watching, but not arresting, prostitutes at work. Soon every employee will have to produce a copy of his or her criminal record. A survey by the Metropolitan Police found that 86 per cent of records were wrong and many mistakes were so bad the alleged criminals could sue. More than a million workplace drug tests were conducted last year as body searches without a warrant became the fashion. Straw will extend mass sampling to police stations. You might think you're not at risk if you're clean, but checks in Ontario found 40 per cent of tests were inaccurate. A drug test means urinating in front of a manager, police officer or medic (who has to certify the right piss has been taken). Isn't this a public humiliation? Isn't it likely that a population which is watched and sampled without judicial oversight, and is wary of reading the wrong email, at home or work, will become passive and suspicious? Outside the call centres where every key stroke and visit to the loo is studied, there is little evidence that people are cowed. The reaction to Straw's internet snooping is the first sign of a general understanding that paranoia is the sanest of responses to the enormous resources corporate and state spies now have at their fingertips. Scott McNealy, the CEO of the cutting-edge company Sun Microsystems, gurgled recently: 'You have zero privacy - get over it!' There is an alternative: Get Straw - or at least don't be so cowed that you would vote for him and his sort again. Bringing the multinationals to book At first glance the misery of the black South Africans coughing up their guts because they had the misfortune to be hired by the British-owned asbestos company, Cape plc, is sad but irrelevant. But to multinationals their condition raises a legal question as important as the addled Pinochet prosecution was to dictators: do courts control conglomerates or vice versa? About 2,000 former Cape employees suffering from lung disease will ask the Law Lords tomorrow for the right to sue for compensation. Their lawyers' pleas look damning. Cape mined and milled asbestos until 1979 in South Africa. As early as 1931 asbestos companies, including Cape, were regulated in Britain. By 1954, the link between asbestos dust and painful deaths was clear. Cape's British workers have had \u00a330 million compensation.

There was no response, although union negotiators had by now talked their way into the boardrooms of nine companies. Their propaganda depicted the employers as deep-pocketed villains. The first crack in the dotcom edifice appeared when Genentech, the biotechnology colossus, backed the janitors' demands. Hundreds of people took to the streets to voice their support for both the firm and the union. A sit-in blocked traffic along dotcom's gilded arteries, Palm Drive and El Camino Drive. There was a stand-off with the police outside the entrance to Hewlett-Packard. Silicon Valley had never seen such effrontery. Finally, the employers made a major concession and the janitors voted to accept a package worth 9 per cent. Peace and clean floors will remain, astride the digital divide, for the moment. Back down Silver Creek stands a handsome house amid bright flowers. Now it's another luxury dotcom home. But it was where John Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath, his classic novel about the tribulations of migrant workers, like those now working in the garden.",

To varying degrees, depending on their interpretation of and adherence to Islamic law (Sharia), Muslims also have concerns about any form of insurance that is not strictly mutual. As a result, British Muslims often avoid any contact with banks, insurance companies and building societies, or if they do have dealings with them, they do so only with extreme reluctance. </p> <p>Abdullah, an accountant from London, has gone to extraordinary lengths to straddle the divide between the secular financial world and his religious beliefs.

But for the sake of short-term financial gain 'I am not going to compromise', he says. </p> <p>Richard Thomas of the Arab Banking Corporation says: 'Most British Muslims would prefer to use an Islamic system.' But because British financial institutions have not woken up to Muslims' specific needs, he says , 'a large proportion of Muslims pay rent, don't have bank accounts, and don't participate fully in the mainstream economy'. The Government's social exclusion unit confirmed this last year, he adds: 'It discovered that Muslims are one of the most disadvantaged groups in the community when it comes to access to financial services.' </p> <p>Abdul Malik from east London says: 'The majority are doing their best to live in the Islamic way, but it is difficult because they don't have any real choice.' He has a credit card, pays it off as soon as possible, but admits a strict Muslim wouldn't have one. Yet when buying a car, he always pays cash rather than taking out a conventional loan with interest. 'I don't compromise on little things like that,' he says. </p> <p>And even his family who, he admits, are not as strict as he is, 'didn't buy a \u00a3220,000 house in north London, because they couldn't buy it in the Islamic way'. Malik says that despite their misgivings, the majority of Muslims are forced to go to a British bank. 'Either that, or keep money under the mattress,' he says. </p> <p>However, according to Nasr-Eldin Ayoub-Bey of the Institute of Islamic Banking and Insurance, many British Muslims have happily adopted western views: 'As with other religions, being a Muslim doesn't automatically make you pious.'. </p> <p>Nihal, from Ealing, has lived in the UK for 20 years. Originally from the Middle East, she has a mortgage, a bank account, and counts her family as practising Muslims. 'These things aren't an issue,' she says. And although she admits 'it's a sensitive subject', when it comes to financial matters, she adopts a pragmatic approach. 'It is impossible to carry out all the Sharia requirements,' she says. And even if alternatives more in keeping with Sharia were available, she says she wouldn't adopt them. </p> <p>The Islamic Investment Banking Unit (IIBU) is one organisation that has identified demand among British Muslims for financial products which adhere to strict Islamic principles. Part of the United Bank of Kuwait, it has been providing British Muslims with home finance according to Sharia law since 1997. </p> <p>'There are 2,600 ways to buy a house in the UK, but only two ways to do so in Sharia. And we offer both,' says Clive Beacham, IIBU's financial products manager. These have been approved by the IIBU's scholars, who must decide whether a product is halal (acceptable) or haram (forbidden) before it can be launched. </p> <p>Beacham says the essential difference between conventional mortgages and IIBU's financing arrangements stems from Islam's abhorrence of usury - charging money on money. So whereas with a mortgage, the lender advances funds to the borrower, and charges interest for the use of that money, Sharia financing avoids anything to do with interest. And, says Beacham: 'Though it took longer to make it work in the UK, there are many advantages for the customer.' </p> <p>Beacham explains how the plans work: 'With the Murabaha plan, the customer gives us a down payment of up to 20 per cent, we buy the property and sell it back to the customer at a profit.' A fixed- term deal of 15 years, with the overall amount to be paid and the monthly instalments known right at the start, he describes it as 'elegant and simple'. </p> <p>The other method, known as Ijara, is based on leasing and a promise to buy. </p> <p>Beacham says that the company is feeling its way towards developing other financial products, but admits that in a banking environment where the rules are not written with you in mind, progress is difficult. </p> <p>But if and when IIBU launches any new products, it is likely to face stiff competition. Iqbal Khan says: 'HSBC is looking at launching a Sharia-compliant global equity fund, and is also considering other products on the retail side.' </p> <p>Other banks, such as Barclays and Citibank, already have their own Islamic banking units. However, despite such initiatives, and others internationally such as the Dow Jones Islamic Index in the US, progress is unlikely to be straightforward. </p> <p>Khan says that the speed at which products can be brought in 'depends on the regulatory environment': products such as the equity fund can come on stream sooner than others, such as home finance. However, he says: 'The FSA [Financial Service Authority] has been positive, and we are hopeful.' </p> <p>Whether or not it will offer Muslims a real alternative, Khan seems determined, at the very least, to widen the choices available. 'The third or fourth generation of Muslims deserve the chance to choose in the same way that people can now choose ethical or environmentally-friendly financial products,' he says. </p> <p>And whatever their beliefs, most people will say amin to that.</p>",

Iqbal Khan says: 'HSBC is looking at launching a Sharia-compliant global equity fund, and is also considering other products on the retail side.' Other banks, such as Barclays and Citibank, already have their own Islamic banking units. However, despite such initiatives, and others internationally such as the Dow Jones Islamic Index in the US, progress is unlikely to be straightforward. Khan says that the speed at which products can be brought in 'depends on the regulatory environment': products such as the equity fund can come on stream sooner than others, such as home finance. However, he says: 'The FSA [Financial Service Authority] has been positive, and we are hopeful.' Whether or not it will offer Muslims a real alternative, Khan seems determined, at the very least, to widen the choices available. 'The third or fourth generation of Muslims deserve the chance to choose in the same way that people can now choose ethical or environmentally-friendly financial products,' he says. And whatever their beliefs, most people will say amin to that.",

      "body": "<p>Who in their right mind would want a home near a world-class sports venue - with all the traffic, crowds and litter that would bring? </p> <p>Some people end up there by accident - newer householders in Kent may find themselves living near a Grand Prix track if Brands Hatch takes over from Silverstone in 2002. Their older neighbours may be pleased - or infuriated - to have it back. </p> <p>Others deliberately move house to be near a sports venue - and even make a profit from it. Probably the most lucrative residential rental market in England is at Wimbledon, south-west London, for the two weeks of the tennis championships. </p> <p>There are few local hotels and, as tennis tournaments go, Wimbledon is long - two weeks. And some male players and sponsors warm up for it at the Stella Artois tournament, which is only a stone's throw away at Hurlingham's Queen's Club. For that period, some of the world's top players choose to rent a house rather than lie in a hotel room. If your home is very local - a maximum of 15 minutes' walk from the All England Club - you can be in for a spectacular return for two weeks. </p> <p>According to Joanna Doniger, who runs the Tennis London letting agency, rents range from about \u00a32,000 a week for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom flat in Wimbledon village to about \u00a37,000-\u00a38,000 a week for a five-bedroom, four-bathroom property with a secluded garden near the club. Owners get about 85 per cent of that fee; the rest goes to the agency as commission. </p> <p>Over its 15-year history, Tennis London has built up a business accommodating about 500 people in some 150 properties during the Wimbledon fortnight. </p> <p>So what is Doniger's advice for residents thinking of letting? 'Your house must have good bathrooms. Tennis players bring their friends and they all want to get to the club at the same time, so they're all getting ready at the same time. And the double beds must be large - tennis players are huge.' </p> <p>But don't expect Formula One world champion Mika Hakkinen to rent a house near the Northamptonshire village of Silverstone for the British Grand Prix - nor to risk getting stuck in mud by bringing a road car to the track. F1 drivers either stay in multi-million pound motorhomes or fly by helicopter from the circuit to hotels (Hakkinen and the McLaren team have stayed at Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons in Oxfordshire in recent years). </p> <p>But there is still plenty of scope for local residents to use their homes to profit from the Grand Prix weekend. Pam and David Holton run a bed and breakfast in the village and, as the race approaches, they organise nearly 40 other properties which take paying B+B customers for a few nights. </p> <p>Almost all of the residents take fewer than six paying customers into their homes, which means they do not have to undergo health and safety inspections. And if, over the course of the weekend, they make \u00a33,250 or less before expenses, there's no tax payable thanks to the Inland Revenue's Rent-a- Room scheme. </p> <p>The Holtons' own permanent B&amp;B business began four years ago. On the Saturday practice day for the Grand Prix, four Japanese tourists asked them if they knew of a bed and breakfast in the village. There were 100,000 people already at the track, and the village has only 750 houses - but the Holtons felt sorry for the four and offered accommodation. The business has grown since then. </p> <p>In the six months leading up to the race, the Holtons will play host to anyone from a grandstand builder to an RAC marshal. They often have visiting contractors working for Eddie Jordan's F1 team which is based nearby. 'The circuit has done a huge amount of good for the village,' says Mrs Holton. </p> <p>Of course, not everyone who lives close to the venues of big sporting events can use their home to make money - some genuinely enjoy being just down the road from the cheers. </p> <p>Islington education officer Ken Witham has lived 200 yards from Arsenal's Highbury football ground since 1980 but is a fan of the club for both the football and what it has done for local residents: 'The club and the council pay for residents' parking permits for Saturday afternoon and weekday evening games, and there are special litter collections after games and sometimes on Sundays too.' </p> <p>'Touch wood, but I think violence is a thing of the past. The all-seater ground now holds about 38,000 instead of over 50,000 - and things like increased prices mean the crowds are more middle-class now than they used to be. </p> <p>'For women and children it can be a little uncomfortable travelling on the Tube or walking nearby at some times on a Saturday afternoon, but that's because of sheer numbers of people around.' </p> <p>Property prices in streets surrounding the ground have been just as buoyant as in any comparable Islington street, according to local agents. And the possibility of the ground expanding by the compulsory purchase of some nearby homes has receded. 'It's certainly not putting anyone off,' says one agent. </p> <p>The British Matchplay golf tournament, run by Mark McCormack's IMG organisation and involving just 12 players, uses 10 of the houses on the Wentworth Estate - again organised by Doniger of Tennis London. The homeowners receive between \u00a35,000 and \u00a36,000 each for the week, with IMG and the tournament sponsors paying not only for the players to use the large homes but also for staff to cook meals and clean during their stay. </p> <p>So if you live near a major sporting event, what are the dos and don'ts to maximise the benefits of your property? </p> <p>\u0095 Do be realistic and accept that this opportunity only applies if the venue is remote - there is more chance of people wanting to beat traffic queues and avoid travelling long distances. </p> <p>\u0095 Do check if there are hotels nearby which normally take the visitors - for example, there is very little house rental around the Grand National at Aintree, because Liverpool is well served by hotels. </p> <p>\u0095 Do check with the Inland Revenue's Guide to Property Income (available from Room 433, 22 Kingsway, London WC2B 6NR) if you intend to let out your home. </p> <p>\u0095 Do consider upgrading your insurance if you vacate your property completely during the rental period. </p> <p>\u0095 Don't over-advertise - if you can only accommodate four people for one weekend, why use the internet, which may attract several thousands enquiries from around the world? </p> <p>\u0095 Don't try to do everything yourself - agents can advise on whether your home has the right facilities and can handle the tenants, often for just 15-20 per cent of your rental value. </p> <p>Don't be tempted to modify your house to make it more attractive - adding another bathroom may get you a slightly better rental during Wimbledon fortnight, but will it 'overdevelop' the property and make it difficult to sell in the long term? </p> <p>And finally, don't wait too long - estate agents at St Andrews in Fife began work a year ago to find homes to let out for the British Golf Open next month.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Who in their right mind would want a home near a world-class sports venue - with all the traffic, crowds and litter that would bring? Some people end up there by accident - newer householders in Kent may find themselves living near a Grand Prix track if Brands Hatch takes over from Silverstone in 2002. Their older neighbours may be pleased - or infuriated - to have it back. Others deliberately move house to be near a sports venue - and even make a profit from it. Probably the most lucrative residential rental market in England is at Wimbledon, south-west London, for the two weeks of the tennis championships. There are few local hotels and, as tennis tournaments go, Wimbledon is long - two weeks. And some male players and sponsors warm up for it at the Stella Artois tournament, which is only a stone's throw away at Hurlingham's Queen's Club. For that period, some of the world's top players choose to rent a house rather than lie in a hotel room. If your home is very local - a maximum of 15 minutes' walk from the All England Club - you can be in for a spectacular return for two weeks. According to Joanna Doniger, who runs the Tennis London letting agency, rents range from about \u00a32,000 a week for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom flat in Wimbledon village to about \u00a37,000-\u00a38,000 a week for a five-bedroom, four-bathroom property with a secluded garden near the club. Owners get about 85 per cent of that fee; the rest goes to the agency as commission. Over its 15-year history, Tennis London has built up a business accommodating about 500 people in some 150 properties during the Wimbledon fortnight. So what is Doniger's advice for residents thinking of letting? 'Your house must have good bathrooms. Tennis players bring their friends and they all want to get to the club at the same time, so they're all getting ready at the same time. And the double beds must be large - tennis players are huge.' But don't expect Formula One world champion Mika Hakkinen to rent a house near the Northamptonshire village of Silverstone for the British Grand Prix - nor to risk getting stuck in mud by bringing a road car to the track. F1 drivers either stay in multi-million pound motorhomes or fly by helicopter from the circuit to hotels (Hakkinen and the McLaren team have stayed at Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons in Oxfordshire in recent years). But there is still plenty of scope for local residents to use their homes to profit from the Grand Prix weekend. Pam and David Holton run a bed and breakfast in the village and, as the race approaches, they organise nearly 40 other properties which take paying B+B customers for a few nights. Almost all of the residents take fewer than six paying customers into their homes, which means they do not have to undergo health and safety inspections. And if, over the course of the weekend, they make \u00a33,250 or less before expenses, there's no tax payable thanks to the Inland Revenue's Rent-a- Room scheme. The Holtons' own permanent B&amp;B business began four years ago. On the Saturday practice day for the Grand Prix, four Japanese tourists asked them if they knew of a bed and breakfast in the village. There were 100,000 people already at the track, and the village has only 750 houses - but the Holtons felt sorry for the four and offered accommodation. The business has grown since then. In the six months leading up to the race, the Holtons will play host to anyone from a grandstand builder to an RAC marshal. They often have visiting contractors working for Eddie Jordan's F1 team which is based nearby. 'The circuit has done a huge amount of good for the village,' says Mrs Holton. Of course, not everyone who lives close to the venues of big sporting events can use their home to make money - some genuinely enjoy being just down the road from the cheers. Islington education officer Ken Witham has lived 200 yards from Arsenal's Highbury football ground since 1980 but is a fan of the club for both the football and what it has done for local residents: 'The club and the council pay for residents' parking permits for Saturday afternoon and weekday evening games, and there are special litter collections after games and sometimes on Sundays too.' 'Touch wood, but I think violence is a thing of the past. The all-seater ground now holds about 38,000 instead of over 50,000 - and things like increased prices mean the crowds are more middle-class now than they used to be. 'For women and children it can be a little uncomfortable travelling on the Tube or walking nearby at some times on a Saturday afternoon, but that's because of sheer numbers of people around.' Property prices in streets surrounding the ground have been just as buoyant as in any comparable Islington street, according to local agents. And the possibility of the ground expanding by the compulsory purchase of some nearby homes has receded. 'It's certainly not putting anyone off,' says one agent. The British Matchplay golf tournament, run by Mark McCormack's IMG organisation and involving just 12 players, uses 10 of the houses on the Wentworth Estate - again organised by Doniger of Tennis London. The homeowners receive between \u00a35,000 and \u00a36,000 each for the week, with IMG and the tournament sponsors paying not only for the players to use the large homes but also for staff to cook meals and clean during their stay. So if you live near a major sporting event, what are the dos and don'ts to maximise the benefits of your property? \u0095 Do be realistic and accept that this opportunity only applies if the venue is remote - there is more chance of people wanting to beat traffic queues and avoid travelling long distances. \u0095 Do check if there are hotels nearby which normally take the visitors - for example, there is very little house rental around the Grand National at Aintree, because Liverpool is well served by hotels. \u0095 Do check with the Inland Revenue's Guide to Property Income (available from Room 433, 22 Kingsway, London WC2B 6NR) if you intend to let out your home. \u0095 Do consider upgrading your insurance if you vacate your property completely during the rental period. \u0095 Don't over-advertise - if you can only accommodate four people for one weekend, why use the internet, which may attract several thousands enquiries from around the world? \u0095 Don't try to do everything yourself - agents can advise on whether your home has the right facilities and can handle the tenants, often for just 15-20 per cent of your rental value. Don't be tempted to modify your house to make it more attractive - adding another bathroom may get you a slightly better rental during Wimbledon fortnight, but will it 'overdevelop' the property and make it difficult to sell in the long term? And finally, don't wait too long - estate agents at St Andrews in Fife began work a year ago to find homes to let out for the British Golf Open next month.",

Second, there are early indications that Lexis, its US legal database, is regaining some of the ground lost to Thomson-Westlaw. Third, the two key new appointments - of executives to head the business and legal divisions - are imminent.

In sum, Davies gave investors a real reason to buy the shares for the first time in years. They have long looked cheap compared with their media peers, but every time someone made a buy case, there was yet another piece of bad news from the group. Now, it seems, the news flow is starting to turn positive at last. Is there more to go for? The recent jump in the shares has put them on a rating of 25 times earnings - and left them 540p above the level where Throg Street cited them as a New Year share tip.</p> <p> If Reed can achieve its other key promise of 7 per cent annual revenue growth by 2002, that will look cheap, but buyers may have to be patient. </p> <p> <strong> Stagecoach strife</strong></p> <p>Why pay more than \u00a3400,000 a year for an outside finance director when we have a 'wee laddie' who could do the job for a fraction of the price. Those comments by Stagecoach chairman Brian Souter about his new finance director, 34 year-old Martin Griffiths, did little to ease concerns about the composition of Stagecoach's board, or the ability of its executives to question his decisions. Judging by the results for the year to March, Souter has some explaining to do.</p> <p> True, profits before exceptionals were up 11 per cent to \u00a3244m. But what happens next concerns the City. The most immediate worry is Coach USA, the US bus company bought last year and proving very troublesome. In the first nine months of Stagecoach's ownership, the 7 per cent rise in revenues was outstripped by a 10 per cent rise in costs. That was doubly disappointing given that Stagecoach owes its reputation, and much of its growth, to its ruthless cost-cutting.</p> <p> It is confident that management changes and new monthly targets will get it back on track. But some worry that, before the takeover, Coach was piling on the acquisitions to boost its sales line without worrying about the quality of the businesses, nor how they fitted with existing operations. Nor can Stagecoach afford to invest too much time in getting Coach USA back on track. The US bus business is fast consolidating - witness the 15 acquisitions made by Coach in the nine months since Stagecoach acquired it. The group will have to scale back those ambitions, but in doing that it runs a greater risk of being left behind - not least by other British operators such as National Express and First Group. </p> <p>There is at least the prospect of higher profits at Coach, given a fair wind and some management effort. Elsewhere in the group, the picture looks bleaker. Bus profits fell marginally, despite higher turnover, as costs rose. Cost pressures are is unlikely to abate; oil prices continue to rise and Stagecoach has no forward cover for next year.</p> <p> Labour costs are also under pressure - the group privately fears industrial action this year. Rail looks better, increasing profits by 16.3 per cent. But franchise renewals are looming and there is no guarantee of it keeping South West Trains - nor of how much it will have to bid to do so. Virgin Rail faces a reduction in subsidy and increased investment.</p> <p> Last year could prove the high point for the business. It will certainly be the high point for group profits, barring dramatic action in the next few months. The sale of the Porterbrook leasing firm, just after the year-end, means profits this year will roughly halve.

Back to the Future meets The Sixth Sense. That is <strong> Frequency</strong>, a cat's cradle of time travel with added serial killing. Jim Cavaziel is a disillusioned New York cop, wallowing in Scotch and lost love, who digs out his dead dad's old ham radio and - hey presto! - finds himself talking to Pa Frank (Dennis Quaid) across 30 years. Quaid was a fireman who died in a warehouse fire. Can Cavaziel, by warning him of the inferno to come, change the history of the next three decades? You bet: and everything - from newspaper headlines to the memory of friends - changes simultaneously. But now, with the change, his mum (a shimmering newcomer, Elizabeth Mitchell) is set to die young herself, murdered by a maniac with a penchant for slashing nurses. </p> <p>The plot, by Toby Emmerich, is like a Russian doll, ripping away mechanically from layer to layer. Gregory Hoblit is a director graduate of the Hill Street Blues Academy. He handles the fires, murders and mayhem with jaggedly exciting aplomb. This, for most of the way, is a roller coaster of a thriller which only goes splat at the end - about three twists too far. But that doesn't matter too much because, for all the guff about parallel universes, the true heart of Frequency is just another love story, this time between father and son. Quaid, the nearly-star of the past two decades, is honest and tender and giving; Cavaziel, the son who thought he'd lost him, has a dogged, hangdog empathy. When they talk baseball and the New York Mets - the hinge of reunion - their relationship lives. Tune to the right human frequency, the only one that matters. </p> <p>If a little of that tale is long on baseball, though, try <strong> For the Love of the Game</strong> which is very long on baseball indeed. Weary of Euro 2000 already? Here's Kevin Costner as a 40-year-old wonder pitcher for the Detroit Tigers about to lose the magazine writer he doesn't know he needs (Kelly Preston) and rescue a wretched season by stuffing the New York Yankees in the final game. Much of the 137 minutes are spent in flashback as Costner, face frozen in constipated introspection, winds up Yankee Stadium (as well as himself for the great decision). </p> <p>This is the third and least of Costner's baseball essays: without the emotional swell of Field of Dreams or the acerbity of Bull Durham . Dana Stevens's screenplay rarely escapes novelette slush, and all Sam Raimi's directorial skills can't spring many surprises. But it is not a total dog. Costner conjures up his old anxious integrity: Preston, the Mrs Travolta who survived Battlefield Earth , manages wounded devotion well. The real trouble for non-fans of baseball is structural. Because you know how many innings there are to go, you know requited love is stuck at first base. Maybe Costner might fancy cricket next? The first film to take five days - without a proper ending. </p> <p>If there's a target audience for a film about the life, times and death of Veronica Guerin, I suppose it's me. I was there a few hours after her murder at a meeting she was due to address: all around, there was wincing shock that a brilliant reporter could be shot down in Dublin (or indeed any Western city boasting a patina of civilisation) because of what she wrote and the drug barons she sought to expose. Thus her story, <strong> When the Sky Falls</strong>, delivered by John MacKenzie of The Long Good Friday, one of Britain's tautest action directors, ought to carry a particular charge. Alas, it is perfectly decent in a penny-plain way, but oddly uninvolving. </p> <p>There is nothing wrong with the casting. Joan Allen (the Hi honey! from Pleasantville ) is a gossamer thin but radiant, staunch Guerin - here lightly disguised as one 'Sinead Hamilton'. Gerard Flynn, Jimmy Smallhorne and Liam Cunningham fish balefully on the dark side of the Liffey. The exploration of Ireland's druggy underworld carries brutal conviction. But this is drama, not documentary, and the trouble is that we all know how it ends, so momentum drains inexorably as the beatings come and go, mere preludes to the awful coup de grce . We're told what happened, but not why. Why Guerin, loving mother and wife, risked everything? Why, on this rendition, her editors let her court such danger? Why she was as she heroically was? Three scriptwriters - including her friend and colleague, Michael Sheridan - can't seem to reach beyond the indomitable surface: perhaps because, even now, no one truly understands what ticked underneath. </p> <p>From one tragic, real journalist to a tragic, synthetic journalist. All downhill, of course. Sandra Bullock is a big-city columnist who pops pills, swigs booze and makes cringingly embarrassing speeches at her sister's wedding, whereupon she staggers into her car and wipes out somebody's front porch. Her sentence is the movie's title: <strong> 28 Days</strong> (in the Serenity Glen Rehabilitation Centre). She begins in caustic denial, spraying defiant wisecracks at pious platitudes. 'Can I have that stitched on a pillow?' But gradually, Sandy realises she's got A Problem. </p> <p>The most interesting thing about 28 Days is that it has done pretty well at the US box office. How, you wonder, can that be? Is it a comedy? Not exactly, though the supporting chorus of recovering addicts is mostly played for farce. (Even Ben Elton might jib at a comedy about drug abuse, sex addiction and self-mutilation). Heavy drama, then, in the Days of Wine and Roses mould? No. Bullock, Hollywood's archetypal kookie waif, is more The Girl with the Golden Orthodontist. The nearest the director, Betty Thomas, comes to a settled style is Soviet workers' film education unit, circa 1957. This is heavy-message territory, and I mean heavy. There's a supremely clunky finale as our heroine and her sister (Elizabeth Perkins) are reconciled. 'I've been such an arse,' says Sandy. 'Every arse needs someone_ to take care of them,' says sis. </p> <p>The script, amazingly enough, is by Susannah Grant, fresh from Erin Brockovich . Did somebody think that Bullock, stuck in a rut as everyone's favourite Julia Roberts reserve, would get a similar lift? She's gallant and appealing, and this is her best for yonks. But the verbal dross around her is total quagmire. Oh Susannah! </p> <p>So to the bottom of the Second Division with a mystery question. Who is Thomas Lee, the director of <strong> Supernova</strong>? Answer: Walter Hill, who made a lot of action movies, including The Driver , in the Seventies and Eighties. Why, then, doesn't he claim this spaced-out yarn as his own? It seems promising enough, a kind of intergalactic ER. Paramedic spaceship Nightingale 229 gets emergency call from deserted mine on rogue moon. Various nude members of crew, experiencing connubial bliss, rush to action stations. </p> <p>Enter Peter Facinelli, who may or may not be the ex-lover of Nightingale's doctor, Angela Bassett. Facinelli turns out to be a Terminator 2 or Alien 3, with extraordinary powers of self-regeneration. Will acting captain James Spader and Bassett save the day? Will a lava lamp blow up the universe and re-make it in some malign image? Does anybody care? </p> <p>Sadly, <strong> Small Time Obsession</strong> can only be a non-league contender. Piotr Szkopiak, its writer, producer and director, is a south London Pole telling the Balham/Catford/Woolwich yarn of other first-generation Poles flirting with petty crime. Lumpen plot, nil excitement or revelation; your heart goes out to a young cast - especially Juliette Caton - who deserve something better than this routinely stuffed cabbage.</p>",

Back to the Future meets The Sixth Sense. That is Frequency, a cat's cradle of time travel with added serial killing. Jim Cavaziel is a disillusioned New York cop, wallowing in Scotch and lost love, who digs out his dead dad's old ham radio and - hey presto! - finds himself talking to Pa Frank (Dennis Quaid) across 30 years. Quaid was a fireman who died in a warehouse fire. Can Cavaziel, by warning him of the inferno to come, change the history of the next three decades? You bet: and everything - from newspaper headlines to the memory of friends - changes simultaneously. But now, with the change, his mum (a shimmering newcomer, Elizabeth Mitchell) is set to die young herself, murdered by a maniac with a penchant for slashing nurses. The plot, by Toby Emmerich, is like a Russian doll, ripping away mechanically from layer to layer. Gregory Hoblit is a director graduate of the Hill Street Blues Academy. He handles the fires, murders and mayhem with jaggedly exciting aplomb. This, for most of the way, is a roller coaster of a thriller which only goes splat at the end - about three twists too far. But that doesn't matter too much because, for all the guff about parallel universes, the true heart of Frequency is just another love story, this time between father and son. Quaid, the nearly-star of the past two decades, is honest and tender and giving; Cavaziel, the son who thought he'd lost him, has a dogged, hangdog empathy. When they talk baseball and the New York Mets - the hinge of reunion - their relationship lives. Tune to the right human frequency, the only one that matters. If a little of that tale is long on baseball, though, try For the Love of the Game which is very long on baseball indeed. Weary of Euro 2000 already? Here's Kevin Costner as a 40-year-old wonder pitcher for the Detroit Tigers about to lose the magazine writer he doesn't know he needs (Kelly Preston) and rescue a wretched season by stuffing the New York Yankees in the final game. Much of the 137 minutes are spent in flashback as Costner, face frozen in constipated introspection, winds up Yankee Stadium (as well as himself for the great decision). This is the third and least of Costner's baseball essays: without the emotional swell of Field of Dreams or the acerbity of Bull Durham . Dana Stevens's screenplay rarely escapes novelette slush, and all Sam Raimi's directorial skills can't spring many surprises. But it is not a total dog. Costner conjures up his old anxious integrity: Preston, the Mrs Travolta who survived Battlefield Earth , manages wounded devotion well. The real trouble for non-fans of baseball is structural. Because you know how many innings there are to go, you know requited love is stuck at first base. Maybe Costner might fancy cricket next? The first film to take five days - without a proper ending. If there's a target audience for a film about the life, times and death of Veronica Guerin, I suppose it's me. I was there a few hours after her murder at a meeting she was due to address: all around, there was wincing shock that a brilliant reporter could be shot down in Dublin (or indeed any Western city boasting a patina of civilisation) because of what she wrote and the drug barons she sought to expose. Thus her story, When the Sky Falls, delivered by John MacKenzie of The Long Good Friday, one of Britain's tautest action directors, ought to carry a particular charge. Alas, it is perfectly decent in a penny-plain way, but oddly uninvolving. There is nothing wrong with the casting. Joan Allen (the Hi honey! from Pleasantville ) is a gossamer thin but radiant, staunch Guerin - here lightly disguised as one 'Sinead Hamilton'. Gerard Flynn, Jimmy Smallhorne and Liam Cunningham fish balefully on the dark side of the Liffey. The exploration of Ireland's druggy underworld carries brutal conviction. But this is drama, not documentary, and the trouble is that we all know how it ends, so momentum drains inexorably as the beatings come and go, mere preludes to the awful coup de grce . We're told what happened, but not why. Why Guerin, loving mother and wife, risked everything? Why, on this rendition, her editors let her court such danger? Why she was as she heroically was? Three scriptwriters - including her friend and colleague, Michael Sheridan - can't seem to reach beyond the indomitable surface: perhaps because, even now, no one truly understands what ticked underneath. From one tragic, real journalist to a tragic, synthetic journalist. All downhill, of course. Sandra Bullock is a big-city columnist who pops pills, swigs booze and makes cringingly embarrassing speeches at her sister's wedding, whereupon she staggers into her car and wipes out somebody's front porch. Her sentence is the movie's title: 28 Days (in the Serenity Glen Rehabilitation Centre). She begins in caustic denial, spraying defiant wisecracks at pious platitudes. 'Can I have that stitched on a pillow?' But gradually, Sandy realises she's got A Problem. The most interesting thing about 28 Days is that it has done pretty well at the US box office. How, you wonder, can that be? Is it a comedy? Not exactly, though the supporting chorus of recovering addicts is mostly played for farce. (Even Ben Elton might jib at a comedy about drug abuse, sex addiction and self-mutilation). Heavy drama, then, in the Days of Wine and Roses mould? No. Bullock, Hollywood's archetypal kookie waif, is more The Girl with the Golden Orthodontist. The nearest the director, Betty Thomas, comes to a settled style is Soviet workers' film education unit, circa 1957. This is heavy-message territory, and I mean heavy. There's a supremely clunky finale as our heroine and her sister (Elizabeth Perkins) are reconciled. 'I've been such an arse,' says Sandy. 'Every arse needs someone_ to take care of them,' says sis. The script, amazingly enough, is by Susannah Grant, fresh from Erin Brockovich . Did somebody think that Bullock, stuck in a rut as everyone's favourite Julia Roberts reserve, would get a similar lift? She's gallant and appealing, and this is her best for yonks. But the verbal dross around her is total quagmire. Oh Susannah! So to the bottom of the Second Division with a mystery question. Who is Thomas Lee, the director of Supernova? Answer: Walter Hill, who made a lot of action movies, including The Driver , in the Seventies and Eighties. Why, then, doesn't he claim this spaced-out yarn as his own? It seems promising enough, a kind of intergalactic ER. Paramedic spaceship Nightingale 229 gets emergency call from deserted mine on rogue moon. Various nude members of crew, experiencing connubial bliss, rush to action stations. Enter Peter Facinelli, who may or may not be the ex-lover of Nightingale's doctor, Angela Bassett. Facinelli turns out to be a Terminator 2 or Alien 3, with extraordinary powers of self-regeneration. Will acting captain James Spader and Bassett save the day? Will a lava lamp blow up the universe and re-make it in some malign image? Does anybody care? Sadly, Small Time Obsession can only be a non-league contender. Piotr Szkopiak, its writer, producer and director, is a south London Pole telling the Balham/Catford/Woolwich yarn of other first-generation Poles flirting with petty crime. Lumpen plot, nil excitement or revelation; your heart goes out to a young cast - especially Juliette Caton - who deserve something better than this routinely stuffed cabbage.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Encounters: New Art from Old </strong> <br>National Gallery, London WC2 to 17 September </p> <p><strong> Turner Prize short list</strong> </p> <p>No British show in living memory has had a grander cast of contemporary stars than <strong> Encounters: New Art from Old </strong> at the National Gallery. Twenty-four of the world's leading artists have been invited to respond to one of the museum's old masters with a work of their own. </p> <p>The dance-card is dazzling: Freud with Chardin, Oldenburg with Vermeer, Bourgeois and Twombly with Turner. Anthony Caro returns to Duccio in 1311; Euan Uglow skips forward to Monet, who was still alive when Balthus, oldest of the living artists, was already copying Poussin. </p> <p>This invitation to understudy the masters is a tactful ruse for infiltrating ancient with modern, for slipping the twenty-first century into a museum that stops at 1900. But it is also a chancy enterprise, as likely to produce outright duds, it seems, as contemporary masterpieces. </p> <p>The museum as muse is a natural subject for a show for the simple reason that art always comes from art. At the Prado, for example, you can see what Vel\u00e1zquez made of Caravaggio, what Goya took from Vel\u00e1zquez and how Picasso fretted over Goya from first to last. At his own request, Turner hangs next to Claude Lorrain in the National Gallery, precisely to acknowledge the debt. </p> <p>Ever since the boom-age of museums in the nineteenth century, artists have been copying the art of the past to see how it worked. If you don't see many easels at the National Gallery today, it may be because the museum opens to artists after hours. </p> <p>Which is precisely how Lucian Freud came to transcribe Chardin's Young Schoolmistress at dead of night over several months. Of all the works in this show, Freud's are undoubtedly the bravest: three hard won copies horribly exposed beside the sublime original. Freud works and reworks Chardin, struggling to discover the secrets of his grace. But each study is progressively coarser and more laborious until the contrast between the artists becomes wincingly painful. The best that can be said of this exercise is that it expresses Freud's devoted humility. </p> <p>Other artists have taken the invitation more lightly. Patrick Caulfield extracts Zurbar\u00e1n's gleaming beaker from the seventeenth century, adds designer beer and incorporates the updated vignette into a contemporary tapas bar. Jeff Wall photographs a Blackpool donkey, camera-shy in its lowly stall, as a counter to the imperious grandeur of Stubbs's thoroughbred Whistlejacket. R.B. Kitaj plants a cigar-chewing billionaire in Vincent's humble chair, signing the picture 'Ronald' in solidarity with his downtrodden forebear. </p> <p>This monologue says a great deal about Kitaj and nothing about Vincent or his chair. But the dialogues the gallery hoped for are going on elsewhere. Hockney's fascination with Ingres produces not one but three dozen love letters, inscribed in portraits of the museum guards. Each isolates a separate element of Ingres's genius: his gift for sketching a perfect head in seconds, his couturier's attention to clothes, the way he tucks the gesturing hands into the final portrait as signposts to the sitter's character. </p> <p>Hockney's works hang in the temporary galleries - they would crowd out the Ingres upstairs. But Encounters spreads right through the museum: Caro's sculptures, adding a third dimension to Duccio, are in the Sunley Room; Hodgkin's version of Seurat's Bathers hangs, Turner-Lorrain style, next to its inspiration. </p> <p>It's a fine reprise, a semi-abstract summary that quickens the stillness of the original. Seurat's motionless smoke becomes a rippling banner, his pointillist dots float free like airy bubbles, barely contained by the frame. You begin to see how much Seurat must have contributed to Hodgkin's distinctive idiom. </p> <p>If Manet means anything to Jasper Johns, on the other hand, he hasn't declared it here. Johns's painting, an expanse of grey encaustic draped with a length of string, looks very much like all the other works in his recent 'Catenary' series. This is the tricky thing about a show like this. The National Gallery sends out polite invitations to the great and the good and is then forced to reap what it sows. How else to explain the inclusion of Balthus's ghastly soft-porn nymph or the faeryland symbolism of Christopher Le Brun, gallery trustee? </p> <p>There are two masterpieces in Encounters, both of them begun before the exhibition was conceived, both independent of the past masters with which they are paired. One is Frank Auerbach's stunning London landscape, a ferment of scarlet vectors and dawn-breaking clouds that just happens to have a compositional affinity with Constable's Haywain. The other is Bill Viola's extraordinary video, The Quintet of the Astonished. </p> <p>Before you is a static frame of four men and a woman, dressed in dateless clothing, huddled together like the mourning figures beneath the Cross. Each is expressing a deep and separate reaction to some unseen event - from anguished fury to beatific trance. The background is shallow and dark, the lighting a little like a Caravaggio. It is some time before you realise that the figures are moving imperceptibly; the picture is alive. </p> <p>What you see is a 50-second film, slowed down to eight minutes of near-frozen time. The configuration changes, the expressions alter, welling, peaking and subsiding. Viola's film visualises emotion in its universal state, rippling through the passage of time. It also condenses in one intensely beautiful tableau all the sorrowing crowd scenes in the National Gallery. </p> <p>Glenn Brown, short-listed this week for the <strong> Turner Prize</strong>, is the quintessential nearly-new artist. Brown paints flawless reproductions of photographs - photographs of famous paintings. You can't see a brushmark in his pictures which, in turn, erase all the painterly nuance of the originals. His work is introverted, styleless and melancholy, as if he were trapped in a world where art was finished. </p> <p>Tomoko Takahashi is equally obsessive. Since graduating from the Slade, she has catalogued all the molehills in a Somerset field and sorted tons of discarded junk on the floor of the Saatchi Gallery - brass tacks, defunct machines, cigarette butts and so on. I liked the way she lit this archipelago with flickering bulbs and tellies, but the sum never amounted to more than the shored-up ruins. </p> <p>Wolfang Tillmans's photographs are just as null as he wants them to be: off-handed shots of club scenes and German pals relieving themselves on sofas. These used to appear in I-D . Now they have unaccountably leaked into the gallery system and on to the Turner shortlist. </p> <p>Which leaves Michael Raedecker, who won last year's John Moores Prize for his beautiful painting of a desert, eerily stitched and sequinned. Perhaps he will win the Turner, too, though Brown is already tipped. Of all the work in this year's sensation-free shortlist, Raedecker's is the least bleak.</p>",

They were respectfully received, but it was only when Norman turned to Gershwin that the first cries of 'Brava!' were heard. </p> <p>Norman's Gershwin is less mannered than many classically trained singers. Her embellishments have an authentic jazz tang and she doesn't exaggerate the emotions simply to prove that she's enjoying herself. No doubt it helped that, to cope with the open-air acoustic, she was amplified, but many singers take that as an excuse to go for broke; Norman's approach was the very opposite of barnstorming. Her 'The Man I Love' had a yearning delicacy, while the inevitable 'Summertime' became a sad lament, the singer's decorations occupying a middle ground between baroque and the blues. </p> <p>Nothing wrong with giving your audience what it expects, but I was more moved by her Berlioz and Ravel, although the tempos that she and conductor Jane Glover adopted sometimes bordered on the laborious. We think of Norman as a singer with a big voice, but her control of dynamics was ravishing, right down to the most fragile pianissimos that a passing plane threatened to overwhelm. Glover and the English Chamber Orchestra provided substantial orchestral interludes by Delius, Elgar and Copland, so that Norman's contribution barely lasted an hour, including a raucously exaggerated encore from Bizet's Carmen , but I don't think anyone felt short-changed. </p> <p>\u0095 Figaro is in rep at Garsington until 7 July (01865 361636) </p> <p> Fiona Maddocks in on holiday</p>",

Before she came onstage, I heard someone say to her companion: 'Isn't it a shame Lesley Garrett isn't doing it this year?' It's hard to imagine Garrett doing comparable justice to such exquisite pieces as Berlioz's Les Nuits d'Et\u00e9 and Ravel's Sch\u00e9h\u00e9razade . They were respectfully received, but it was only when Norman turned to Gershwin that the first cries of 'Brava!' were heard. Norman's Gershwin is less mannered than many classically trained singers. Her embellishments have an authentic jazz tang and she doesn't exaggerate the emotions simply to prove that she's enjoying herself. No doubt it helped that, to cope with the open-air acoustic, she was amplified, but many singers take that as an excuse to go for broke; Norman's approach was the very opposite of barnstorming. Her 'The Man I Love' had a yearning delicacy, while the inevitable 'Summertime' became a sad lament, the singer's decorations occupying a middle ground between baroque and the blues. Nothing wrong with giving your audience what it expects, but I was more moved by her Berlioz and Ravel, although the tempos that she and conductor Jane Glover adopted sometimes bordered on the laborious. We think of Norman as a singer with a big voice, but her control of dynamics was ravishing, right down to the most fragile pianissimos that a passing plane threatened to overwhelm. Glover and the English Chamber Orchestra provided substantial orchestral interludes by Delius, Elgar and Copland, so that Norman's contribution barely lasted an hour, including a raucously exaggerated encore from Bizet's Carmen , but I don't think anyone felt short-changed. \u0095 Figaro is in rep at Garsington until 7 July (01865 361636) Fiona Maddocks in on holiday",

That sounds irritating - too stuffed with arty portent and Gallic symbolism, but, in fact, it works perfectly. There is so little you need to know to know these lovers well. We aren't shown the initial couplings. The hotel door along the red corridor closes behind them. It is only much later that she suggests they make love. But haven't we been doing that? says Lopez.

Here, she is by turns plain and beautiful, nudging into middle-age and frightened, from bitter experience, of risking too much until risk carries her away. It is Lopez, though, who defines the relationship, with his flat, peasant face and his slow, winning smile. He would have answered that ad: but he would also have instinctively added the romantic dimension. He's the salt of the earth. They are good, damaged souls: they deserve each other and some joy as the door finally opens. When they find out they're in love, he cries, stolid on a brasserie chair surrounded by the clatter of cutlery. A private moment. </p> <p>Dr Feelgood, of course, makes an excuse and leaves at the very start. This is not going to end in conventional happiness. It is the love of regret, mistakes, misunder standings, just as the sex between them is occasionally perfect and often not. Ordinary men and women; ordinary successes and failures; the laughs of togetherness and the pains of parting. But there's no tragedy at the close, no bleakness - only a drawing back into self, a sense that what they shared survives in a time capsule of warm recollection. Fonteyne has peeled away all the usual trappings and left us with the core: a relationship etched in essentially human terms. He began with prize-winning short films and he retains his flair for close-packed brevity. Eighty-one minutes have you there for every emotion, every sentence which links Him and Her. A terse, enclosed, intense world, and an affair to remember. </p> <p>\u0095 Philip French is on holiday</p>",

But there's no tragedy at the close, no bleakness - only a drawing back into self, a sense that what they shared survives in a time capsule of warm recollection. Fonteyne has peeled away all the usual trappings and left us with the core: a relationship etched in essentially human terms. He began with prize-winning short films and he retains his flair for close-packed brevity. Eighty-one minutes have you there for every emotion, every sentence which links Him and Her. A terse, enclosed, intense world, and an affair to remember. \u0095 Philip French is on holiday",

He makes furniture that could be sculpture, but he is also an ingenious and gifted designer, one who is as interested in ideas as much as technique. </p> <p>And his work addresses some of the major questions facing an institution such as the V&amp;A in which you can find Raphael cartoons as well as snuff boxes, Bauhaus chairs and Frank Lloyd Wright interiors. Is design a decorative, and therefore supposedly 'minor' art, or is the manufacturing of objects that have at their heart a utilitarian purpose a means of exploring some of the issues facing a technologically sophisticated culture? </p> <p>On the one hand, design is about the creation of anonymous mass-produced objects, by people who spend a lot of time worrying about injection moulding, or about the precise degree of curve needed to blunt the sharp edges of a computer monitor. On the other hand, it is also about how to make objects that feel good to touch and to use. </p> <p>Design has become the sometimes cynical process of making what were once serious, unselfconscious products - watches, for example, or cameras and even cars, into toys for adults, pandering to our fantasies about ourselves, ruthlessly tapping into our willingness to pay to be entertained or flattered by our possessions. The designer is there to make products that look expensive even if they are cheap to make, which look rugged and therefore glamorous, often when they are flimsy or playful, even when they are actually gas-guzzling cars. </p> <p>Design is seen to be a species of activity not to be considered in the same breath as art, which is supposedly about a whole category of entirely different things.

Unwinding through the entrance hall, and on into the heart of the museum Arad has created a catwalk that shows the range of his work, from some of his earliest experiments with recycling and salvage, to his most recent designs intended for industrial production. Arad originally trained as an architect, which may be what gave him an interest in working on a scale that few designers can match. He has recently installed a giant wind wand, an infinitely slender 50 metre gash of red carbon fibre, equipped with a light at the tip that moves gently back and forth in the breeze at Canary Wharf as if daring the high-rise towers around it to do the same. But it is for his boldly sculptural welded metal furni ture that he is best known. </p> <p>He began by creative recycling, more from necessity than as a conscious choice. Just out of college, nobody was going to manufacture his work. Working as a traditional craftsman didn't appeal. But scavenging discarded industrial materials and putting them to new uses offered the chance of making objects that had some of the polished characteristics of mass production at a scale that was within his means. He worked on a series of readymades, in the manner of Duchamp. A seat salvaged from a time-expired Rover became an armchair, a scooter seat turned into a stool, and he used scaffolding to make bedsteads. </p> <p>Then he started to work in metal, welding and forming it into shape in his own workshop with a group of assistants. His work was intuitive. He would start on a piece without quite knowing where it was going, and allow the characteristics of the process shape the result.

Not utilitarian, necessarily, and not exactly art, either. </p> <p>Arad has now dispensed with the workshop, but he has found ways of using his computer as both a pencil and surrogate workshop. Images conceived on the screen can be used as the template to create physical objects directly; he puts the techniques of mass production to work to create individual pieces, in a way that seems to run directly counter to the idea of industrialisation. He likes to make objects that aren't identical but which manage to have a unique identity of their own, even when they are made in large numbers. But at the same time as working on these one-off pieces, he has also designed a shelving system squeezed out of machines by the kilometre which has become a best- seller, and the two newest objects that he is showing at the V&amp;A are not one- offs, but eminently practical folding chairs designed to be sold in their thousands, if not hundreds of thousands. </p> <p>The two aspects of his work inform each other.

      "body": "<p><strong> Woody Allen </strong> R2 </p> <p><strong> How the West Was Shot </strong> World Service </p> <p><strong> And the Band Played On </strong> R3 </p> <p>Someone called Woody Allen to ask if it was true that Monica Lewinsky was in his new film. She wasn't, he told Mark Kermode in<strong> Woody Allen</strong> but if she could act and if he had a plot she was right for, he wouldn't hesitate to cast her. That's the way celebrity works in America, he said, sounding unhappy. </p> <p>Every lawyer from the O.J. Simpson trial now has a TV show, every hostage gets a tickertape parade in New York and the most famous name in the US belongs to a girl who happens to have had sex with the President. 'The people that we celebrate indicate a certain culture run amok.' </p> <p>It made a change to hear Allen talking normally and it says much for Kermode's interviewing technique that he managed to prise so much from a man who famously dislikes the media. This was a serious conversation and though I missed those famed one-liners - 'If you could live your life over again, Mr Allen, what would you do differently?' 'I wouldn't read Moby-Dick ' - it was interesting to hear his views on music and magic, the fore most passions of his life apart from his ex-wife's adopted daughter, of course. </p> <p>I hadn't realised what an accomplished jazz clarinettist he was.

      "bodyText": "Woody Allen R2 How the West Was Shot World Service And the Band Played On R3 Someone called Woody Allen to ask if it was true that Monica Lewinsky was in his new film. She wasn't, he told Mark Kermode in Woody Allen but if she could act and if he had a plot she was right for, he wouldn't hesitate to cast her. That's the way celebrity works in America, he said, sounding unhappy. Every lawyer from the O.J. Simpson trial now has a TV show, every hostage gets a tickertape parade in New York and the most famous name in the US belongs to a girl who happens to have had sex with the President. 'The people that we celebrate indicate a certain culture run amok.' It made a change to hear Allen talking normally and it says much for Kermode's interviewing technique that he managed to prise so much from a man who famously dislikes the media. This was a serious conversation and though I missed those famed one-liners - 'If you could live your life over again, Mr Allen, what would you do differently?' 'I wouldn't read Moby-Dick ' - it was interesting to hear his views on music and magic, the fore most passions of his life apart from his ex-wife's adopted daughter, of course. I hadn't realised what an accomplished jazz clarinettist he was. He didn't go to Hollywood to collect his Annie Hall Oscar because it coincided with the night he was playing with his band in New York. That was the other enduring thing about Allen the man, not Allen the mouth - he is modest.

      "body": "<p>Anthropolgists looking back at the dawn of twenty-first century Britain may surmise that we were schizophrenic: a society that idealised childhood, but demonised the problematic, sexualised adolescent. At its crudest, this means the birth of the Prime Minister's baby is attended by sentimental euphoria, while girls and boys born barely a decade before are already the objects of our horror. Indeed, the latest research suggests that the first dark signs of adolescence - menstrual blood and pubic hair - are now often occurring in children as young as eight or nine. Whither childhood? </p> <p>Moreover, despite what appears to be the best combined efforts of parents and media to sit hard on the lid of this particular Pandora's box, the early onset of puberty in some of our children is almost certainly directly linked with early sexual activity. You may not want to hear this, but we may now be living in a time when Lolita is no longer a literary study in perversion, but a unisex, medically and sociologically substantiated reality. </p> <p>The new research - featured in the forthcoming three-part Channel 4 series, Sex From 8 to 18, and conducted by Professor Jean Golding, of the University of Bristol, on an initial sample of 1,150 eight-year-old children in Avon - reveals that one in six eight-year-old girls has started puberty, with signs of breast buds, pubic hair or both, compared with only one in 100 a generation ago. Similarly, one in 14 eight-year-old boys now has pubic hair, when, back in the Sixties, this was a mark of the over-13s. </p> <p>'We don't actually ask parents if they are surprised by the early onset of puberty in their children,' Golding tells me. 'But it's incredible how many of them, off their own bat, will say: \"Thank goodness you asked that question!\" They are all worried that their child is exceptional, but we are able to reassure them that it does appear to be extremely common.' </p> <p>Part of the blame for the ongoing blizzard of misinformation, confusion, and anxiety concerning puberty could be put down to the fact that, until very recently, the international model for all research on pubescence was a British report compiled in 1962 by Professor James Tanner. For his study, Tanner focused on a mere 200 boys and girls in children's homes in London. There followed a wait of almost 40 years, ended in 1997, by research on 17,000 American children, aged from three to 13, which was conducted by Dr Marcia Herman-Giddens. In America, child sexuality is said to be even more a problem - with 'fast sex' replacing 'fast food' in the schoolyard. As Herman-Giddens's study concluded that the average age for puberty had gone down dramatically, raging hormones could well be to blame. </p> <p>Two paediatricians, Rosemary Jones and Fiona Finley, based in Bath, acknowledge the value of the US study, but feel that merely applying its findings to this country might be shortsighted. They are currently trying to set up their own study, which would feature thousands of British children. The chief problems for Jones and Finley appear to be time, money, and, remarkably, the still prevalent Victorian repressiveness - the 'cover the table legs' primness - of British culture. </p> <p>As Clare Richards, series producer of Sex From 8 to 18 , observes wryly: 'It says something that it takes two concerned mothers - community paediatricians, who've seen the anecdotal evidence - to get off their backsides, and say something has to be done.' </p> <p>Jones agrees: 'You've got to have a really good excuse to look at a well child's body in this country. We can show children photographs and life drawings all we like, but sooner or later, we've got to \"have a look\" at some of them.' Jones reveals that part of the routine check of a boy's pubescent development is sizing their testicles with a set of differently sized beads. 'At a certain size, a threshold of about four millimetres, it's an indicator that hormone production is under way,' she says. 'But it's not as if you can go around doing these tests on the street!' </p> <p>Of course, if it were just a matter of physical development, the public would probably be about as interested in all this as they would be in stat sheets on how our generally improved health is affecting the size of children's feet (rather a lot, as it happens). The fact that pubescence is, by definition, sexual, transforms this research into scientific dynamite - not to mention a primal tinderbox of morality and unease. Just as some of our children are said to be drowning in premature hormones, so is society reeling from the prospect of hordes of 'horny' children, some as young as 10, having sex in the streets. While for paedophiles this could be construed as a weird form of encouragement ('We are all too painfully aware that this research could be cynically manipulated,' says Richards), most adults would be appalled by the thought of suddenly sexualised children. </p> <p>Indeed, it seems to me that we are, as a nation of parents, colluding in either ignoring, or, even worse, fetishising the problem of 'teenage sexuality'. Hence the routine media hoo-ha over under-age pregnancies, which always seems to subtly suggest that only those girls who 'actually get pregnant' are having sex, while the rest of British childkind are presumably still busy playing with Lego, and thinking Jenny Agutter is rather brill in The Railway Children. Observing this wilfully ostrich-like, not to mention quasi-bigoted, reaction (socially deprived young girls are three times more likely to keep the baby, rather than have an abortion), one could almost start wishing that British parents would start growing up intellectually as fast as their children are obviously doing physically. However, the real question is, what do we do about it? 'Hairy', 'budding' and even 'sexually active' they might suddenly and scarily be, but they are still our children. So how do we go about helping them? </p> <p>The experts seem to agree that the best way forward is a combination of early information, and better (much better) communication. The common consensus is that, however they look or act, it may take some time for early pubescents to catch up emotionally with their fast-changing bodies, and they need all the support they can get. Indeed, when researching this article, and talking to youngsters - some of whom are featured in the interviews below - I was greatly struck, by how, even while using highly potent, adult, some might say shocking language and imagery to describe the sexual behaviour of themselves and their peers, the majority retained their innate child-like vulnerability. </p> <p>These schoolkids are not the pages of Lolita come to life, nor are they manifestations of our 'declining standards'. They're ordinary young people, at the mercy of their own biology, who are in need of understanding, tolerance, and - perish the thought - the occasional bawling out. Children in adults' skin. </p> <p><strong>In their own words: 'Girls just want a cuddle. But the boys pressurise them'</strong></p> <p><strong> Fallon (15)</strong> </p> <p> My mother helped me a lot during puberty - she wasn't embarrassed like some mums. There was sex education at primary school, but that was more to do with periods, what a Tampax does with water, stuff like that. We did contraception when we were 13, but a lot of the kids had already had sex, a long time before. Parents would be amazed by what some of their 'little angels' get up to. With the boys, it's not so bad. It's like: 'He's 16 now, he's probably having sex.' But, with the girls, it's like their parents can't picture it - they blot it out because they don't want to know. </p> <p>Girls are wanting to experience sex at 13, 14, and younger. Some of them sleep with one person after another, and they hardly know the boys sometimes. With others, it's their first ever boyfriend, and they're having sex straight away. I think these girls don't really want sex a lot of the time - they just want a kiss and a cuddle, or they just want to be with a certain boy because they like him. But the boys pressurise them. It used to be just kissing, but now it goes much further. Kissing, feeling, wanking the boys, letting boys finger them. After enough times, it gets closer, and they have sex properly. </p> <p>I don't know why it's all getting so fast. If a girl is really dirty, then she deserves to be called a skit [slut], but it's like even really little girls, of about 12 or 13, go through so much pain and stress. I think they should wait. It's all about sex, when it should be about making love. Some boys are really honest and nice, but most of them are just after a sex life. </p> <p>Oliver (16) </p> <p> I started noticing girls properly three or four years ago, but the younger ones in my area seem to be getting involved in sex earlier, around 10 or 11 or so. I'm quite surprised myself. There's kids getting each other pregnant and having abortions. You think, what's happening? I have black and white friends. Some white parents are completely open about what their kids do, and like to talk things over, but that's embarrassing. Black parents are more religious and strict, and they can't have any idea what their kids get up to. If they did, they'd be beating them. There's no such thing as sex education in school - how can you be taught something you already know? </p> <p>It's mainly the girls who drink, smoke, sniff coke, take ecstasy and LSD. When girls go out, they're crazy. But girls are more romantic than boys, they're into fairytales. When you're a boy growing up, the testosterone's building up, and sometimes you just have to go out and get a piece, ride the ride, have a little 'practice'. </p> <p>If a boy's after a one-night stand, he'll look for a skit. A skit is someone who's up for anything with anyone, anywhere, even when you're in school. Boys just got to talk to them, and they give them a blow job, or have sex. If a boy manages to get with loads of girls, he's seen as a don, a romeo, or a player. There's no such thing as a male skit. </p> <p> There are girls who are decent and gain your respect. Decent girls know how to keep their mouths and legs shut. Then there's skits. Some skits are young, 14 and that. There's even skits as young as 12 running about, and that's not good. No one treats skits well. Decent girls fight them, and boys use them for sexual experience. You can do what you want to skits and they'll still sleep with you. Like one boy kicked a skit out after they'd done it, and she was back at his house the next day. </p> <p>Another time, I saw this girl and four boys, all around my age, underneath an arch. You could just see their heads, and hear this boy shouting: 'Do it, do it! Faster, faster!'. Then the other three boys were on her. She's a skit. Boys knock on her door, and she just goes around and gives them a 'shine' [oral sex]. She wants to be popular, but the boys got no respect for her. I wouldn't have anything to do with a girl like that. She offered once. I said 'No'. </p> <p>If a boy sleeps with lots of girls, it's different, it's an accomplishment. There'll be this big group of you, and they'll all be bragging about what they've done. Like: 'We were playing on the computer, I was feeling her up, and then I 'pressed' her [had sex].' If a boy has been going with a girl for a while, or she's not a skit, he won't say nothing. </p> <p>Most people use condoms, unless they're gagging for it, or stupid. Nobody's worried about HIV, not with girls our age, but a few have got pregnant. There's this one boy everyone calls 'Daddy', because he's got a kid at 15. I'm too young for that kind of responsibility. </p> <p><strong>In their own words: 'Sex is fun, and everyone should know it.'</strong></p> <p><strong> Lucie (16)</strong> </p> <p> My body started changing when I was about 10. By the time I was 12, my breasts started feeling really sore. I went to the doctor, and he said: 'They're starting to grow.' I got hair and stuff a bit later. At about 12, my periods started. I was so excited, I cried - I was like, 'Oh mummy! Oh god!' My mum was really supportive and that made all the difference. You're so emotional during puberty. The hormones come along and it's like - right, you're going to be in a bad mood now. </p> <p>I lost my virginity at 13. I was on the pill, and it was with one of my friend's older brothers who was 18. I wasn't frightened, it didn't hurt, but now I've slept with some other people, and I know how exciting sex can be, I can see that it wasn't very good. After that, the sex just kept happening, I don't know why. I've never even found men's bodies that attractive. I like their shoulders and backs, but nothing else. </p> <p>My present boyfriend is 25 - I get on better with people who are a bit older. Last year, I went with a 17-year-old and it was bizarre. He was nice, but he was always wanting to hang out with his mates and drink cider, and I'm past all that. I can't wait to get to college. I get name-called at school and it's upsetting sometimes. But I also feel more confident, less naive, than other girls. When horrible drunks come on to me in pubs, I can handle them. Why shouldn't girls be advanced? I like to experiment, try different things. Sex is fun and everyone should know it. It shouldn't just be about guys pleasuring themselves. I know I should protect myself more, but condoms are awkward. I wouldn't like to say how many sexual partners I've had. </p> <p><strong> WILL (17)</strong> </p> <p> I've always known I was gay, but I didn't realise what it meant until I was about 10. I kissed a boy at 11, but I became properly sexually active when I was 13. We were at his house, and it just happened - we did mutual masturbation. Afterwards, he decided he was totally straight, but he's gay again now. It got easier when I got to college, and other people were gay or bi[sexual].

      "bodyText": "Anthropolgists looking back at the dawn of twenty-first century Britain may surmise that we were schizophrenic: a society that idealised childhood, but demonised the problematic, sexualised adolescent. At its crudest, this means the birth of the Prime Minister's baby is attended by sentimental euphoria, while girls and boys born barely a decade before are already the objects of our horror. Indeed, the latest research suggests that the first dark signs of adolescence - menstrual blood and pubic hair - are now often occurring in children as young as eight or nine. Whither childhood? Moreover, despite what appears to be the best combined efforts of parents and media to sit hard on the lid of this particular Pandora's box, the early onset of puberty in some of our children is almost certainly directly linked with early sexual activity. You may not want to hear this, but we may now be living in a time when Lolita is no longer a literary study in perversion, but a unisex, medically and sociologically substantiated reality. The new research - featured in the forthcoming three-part Channel 4 series, Sex From 8 to 18, and conducted by Professor Jean Golding, of the University of Bristol, on an initial sample of 1,150 eight-year-old children in Avon - reveals that one in six eight-year-old girls has started puberty, with signs of breast buds, pubic hair or both, compared with only one in 100 a generation ago. Similarly, one in 14 eight-year-old boys now has pubic hair, when, back in the Sixties, this was a mark of the over-13s. 'We don't actually ask parents if they are surprised by the early onset of puberty in their children,' Golding tells me. 'But it's incredible how many of them, off their own bat, will say: \"Thank goodness you asked that question!\" They are all worried that their child is exceptional, but we are able to reassure them that it does appear to be extremely common.' Part of the blame for the ongoing blizzard of misinformation, confusion, and anxiety concerning puberty could be put down to the fact that, until very recently, the international model for all research on pubescence was a British report compiled in 1962 by Professor James Tanner. For his study, Tanner focused on a mere 200 boys and girls in children's homes in London. There followed a wait of almost 40 years, ended in 1997, by research on 17,000 American children, aged from three to 13, which was conducted by Dr Marcia Herman-Giddens. In America, child sexuality is said to be even more a problem - with 'fast sex' replacing 'fast food' in the schoolyard. As Herman-Giddens's study concluded that the average age for puberty had gone down dramatically, raging hormones could well be to blame. Two paediatricians, Rosemary Jones and Fiona Finley, based in Bath, acknowledge the value of the US study, but feel that merely applying its findings to this country might be shortsighted. They are currently trying to set up their own study, which would feature thousands of British children. The chief problems for Jones and Finley appear to be time, money, and, remarkably, the still prevalent Victorian repressiveness - the 'cover the table legs' primness - of British culture. As Clare Richards, series producer of Sex From 8 to 18 , observes wryly: 'It says something that it takes two concerned mothers - community paediatricians, who've seen the anecdotal evidence - to get off their backsides, and say something has to be done.' Jones agrees: 'You've got to have a really good excuse to look at a well child's body in this country. We can show children photographs and life drawings all we like, but sooner or later, we've got to \"have a look\" at some of them.' Jones reveals that part of the routine check of a boy's pubescent development is sizing their testicles with a set of differently sized beads. 'At a certain size, a threshold of about four millimetres, it's an indicator that hormone production is under way,' she says. 'But it's not as if you can go around doing these tests on the street!' Of course, if it were just a matter of physical development, the public would probably be about as interested in all this as they would be in stat sheets on how our generally improved health is affecting the size of children's feet (rather a lot, as it happens). The fact that pubescence is, by definition, sexual, transforms this research into scientific dynamite - not to mention a primal tinderbox of morality and unease. Just as some of our children are said to be drowning in premature hormones, so is society reeling from the prospect of hordes of 'horny' children, some as young as 10, having sex in the streets. While for paedophiles this could be construed as a weird form of encouragement ('We are all too painfully aware that this research could be cynically manipulated,' says Richards), most adults would be appalled by the thought of suddenly sexualised children. Indeed, it seems to me that we are, as a nation of parents, colluding in either ignoring, or, even worse, fetishising the problem of 'teenage sexuality'. Hence the routine media hoo-ha over under-age pregnancies, which always seems to subtly suggest that only those girls who 'actually get pregnant' are having sex, while the rest of British childkind are presumably still busy playing with Lego, and thinking Jenny Agutter is rather brill in The Railway Children. Observing this wilfully ostrich-like, not to mention quasi-bigoted, reaction (socially deprived young girls are three times more likely to keep the baby, rather than have an abortion), one could almost start wishing that British parents would start growing up intellectually as fast as their children are obviously doing physically. However, the real question is, what do we do about it? 'Hairy', 'budding' and even 'sexually active' they might suddenly and scarily be, but they are still our children. So how do we go about helping them? The experts seem to agree that the best way forward is a combination of early information, and better (much better) communication. The common consensus is that, however they look or act, it may take some time for early pubescents to catch up emotionally with their fast-changing bodies, and they need all the support they can get. Indeed, when researching this article, and talking to youngsters - some of whom are featured in the interviews below - I was greatly struck, by how, even while using highly potent, adult, some might say shocking language and imagery to describe the sexual behaviour of themselves and their peers, the majority retained their innate child-like vulnerability. These schoolkids are not the pages of Lolita come to life, nor are they manifestations of our 'declining standards'. They're ordinary young people, at the mercy of their own biology, who are in need of understanding, tolerance, and - perish the thought - the occasional bawling out. Children in adults' skin. In their own words: 'Girls just want a cuddle. But the boys pressurise them' Fallon (15) My mother helped me a lot during puberty - she wasn't embarrassed like some mums. There was sex education at primary school, but that was more to do with periods, what a Tampax does with water, stuff like that. We did contraception when we were 13, but a lot of the kids had already had sex, a long time before. Parents would be amazed by what some of their 'little angels' get up to. With the boys, it's not so bad. It's like: 'He's 16 now, he's probably having sex.' But, with the girls, it's like their parents can't picture it - they blot it out because they don't want to know. Girls are wanting to experience sex at 13, 14, and younger. Some of them sleep with one person after another, and they hardly know the boys sometimes. With others, it's their first ever boyfriend, and they're having sex straight away. I think these girls don't really want sex a lot of the time - they just want a kiss and a cuddle, or they just want to be with a certain boy because they like him. But the boys pressurise them. It used to be just kissing, but now it goes much further. Kissing, feeling, wanking the boys, letting boys finger them. After enough times, it gets closer, and they have sex properly. I don't know why it's all getting so fast. If a girl is really dirty, then she deserves to be called a skit [slut], but it's like even really little girls, of about 12 or 13, go through so much pain and stress. I think they should wait. It's all about sex, when it should be about making love. Some boys are really honest and nice, but most of them are just after a sex life. Oliver (16) I started noticing girls properly three or four years ago, but the younger ones in my area seem to be getting involved in sex earlier, around 10 or 11 or so. I'm quite surprised myself. There's kids getting each other pregnant and having abortions. You think, what's happening? I have black and white friends. Some white parents are completely open about what their kids do, and like to talk things over, but that's embarrassing. Black parents are more religious and strict, and they can't have any idea what their kids get up to. If they did, they'd be beating them. There's no such thing as sex education in school - how can you be taught something you already know? It's mainly the girls who drink, smoke, sniff coke, take ecstasy and LSD. When girls go out, they're crazy. But girls are more romantic than boys, they're into fairytales. When you're a boy growing up, the testosterone's building up, and sometimes you just have to go out and get a piece, ride the ride, have a little 'practice'. If a boy's after a one-night stand, he'll look for a skit. A skit is someone who's up for anything with anyone, anywhere, even when you're in school. Boys just got to talk to them, and they give them a blow job, or have sex. If a boy manages to get with loads of girls, he's seen as a don, a romeo, or a player. There's no such thing as a male skit. There are girls who are decent and gain your respect. Decent girls know how to keep their mouths and legs shut. Then there's skits. Some skits are young, 14 and that. There's even skits as young as 12 running about, and that's not good. No one treats skits well. Decent girls fight them, and boys use them for sexual experience. You can do what you want to skits and they'll still sleep with you. Like one boy kicked a skit out after they'd done it, and she was back at his house the next day. Another time, I saw this girl and four boys, all around my age, underneath an arch. You could just see their heads, and hear this boy shouting: 'Do it, do it! Faster, faster!'. Then the other three boys were on her. She's a skit. Boys knock on her door, and she just goes around and gives them a 'shine' [oral sex]. She wants to be popular, but the boys got no respect for her. I wouldn't have anything to do with a girl like that. She offered once. I said 'No'. If a boy sleeps with lots of girls, it's different, it's an accomplishment. There'll be this big group of you, and they'll all be bragging about what they've done. Like: 'We were playing on the computer, I was feeling her up, and then I 'pressed' her [had sex].' If a boy has been going with a girl for a while, or she's not a skit, he won't say nothing. Most people use condoms, unless they're gagging for it, or stupid. Nobody's worried about HIV, not with girls our age, but a few have got pregnant. There's this one boy everyone calls 'Daddy', because he's got a kid at 15. I'm too young for that kind of responsibility. In their own words: 'Sex is fun, and everyone should know it.' Lucie (16) My body started changing when I was about 10. By the time I was 12, my breasts started feeling really sore. I went to the doctor, and he said: 'They're starting to grow.' I got hair and stuff a bit later. At about 12, my periods started. I was so excited, I cried - I was like, 'Oh mummy! Oh god!' My mum was really supportive and that made all the difference. You're so emotional during puberty. The hormones come along and it's like - right, you're going to be in a bad mood now. I lost my virginity at 13. I was on the pill, and it was with one of my friend's older brothers who was 18. I wasn't frightened, it didn't hurt, but now I've slept with some other people, and I know how exciting sex can be, I can see that it wasn't very good. After that, the sex just kept happening, I don't know why. I've never even found men's bodies that attractive. I like their shoulders and backs, but nothing else. My present boyfriend is 25 - I get on better with people who are a bit older. Last year, I went with a 17-year-old and it was bizarre. He was nice, but he was always wanting to hang out with his mates and drink cider, and I'm past all that. I can't wait to get to college. I get name-called at school and it's upsetting sometimes. But I also feel more confident, less naive, than other girls. When horrible drunks come on to me in pubs, I can handle them. Why shouldn't girls be advanced? I like to experiment, try different things. Sex is fun and everyone should know it. It shouldn't just be about guys pleasuring themselves. I know I should protect myself more, but condoms are awkward. I wouldn't like to say how many sexual partners I've had. WILL (17) I've always known I was gay, but I didn't realise what it meant until I was about 10. I kissed a boy at 11, but I became properly sexually active when I was 13. We were at his house, and it just happened - we did mutual masturbation. Afterwards, he decided he was totally straight, but he's gay again now. It got easier when I got to college, and other people were gay or bi[sexual]. I did sleep with one girl when I was 15, because I wanted to be certain. I managed it, but it wasn't exactly: 'Wow, breasts!' I felt really guilty afterwards. When I first came out to my parents, we didn't get on for a while, but it isn't an issue any more. No one uses condoms for oral sex, though I would for intercourse. You become experienced by practising - it's not like: 'How do you give a blow job?'

Eventually, he stopped and said sorry, but he looked a bit pissed off. It's difficult at times. I've had trouble from homophobic boys - they'd throw bottles, threaten me, say they were going to wipe the 'ugly queer smile' off my face.

      "body": "<p>Two weeks ago, US rapper Eminem's second album, The Marshall Mathers LP, soared to the top of the US charts. When the first week's sales figures were released, few could dispute the Detroit rapper's arrival as a major-league player. The album - featuring tales of rape, shootings, drug overdoses and throat-slittings - shifted 1.7 million units in only seven days, making it the fastest-selling rap album ever. </p> <p>Such sales seemed to vindicate the opinions of US rock critics who, for the most part, have been wildly enthusiastic about the rapper's work. On the release of the new album, Newsweek explained away Eminem's misogyny by noting with approval: 'Eminem [is] arguably the most compelling figure in all of pop music. He picks on himself almost as much as he does the people on his enemies list. By flipping his razor-sharp lyrics on himself, Eminem subverts the smirking superiority that plagues mainstream rap, a wily underdog move that lets him get away with more than he could otherwise.' </p> <p>The LA Times gushed: 'Eminem is simply exercising his creative impulses - putting on disc all the forbidden thoughts and scandalous scenarios that accompany adolescence and just watching the fallout.' </p> <p> 'My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me </p> <p>For a gift I had 10 of my boys take her virginity </p> <p>And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak </p> <p>Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was asleep' </p> <p><strong> Eminem, 'Amityville'</strong> </p> <p> In recent weeks Eminem's supposedly satirical take on gangsta rap has begun to seem less of a joke. On 8 June, he was charged for allegedly brandishing a gun at Douglas Dail, a member of rap group Insane Clown Posse, in Detroit. Eminem was charged with possession of a concealed weapon and brandishing of a firearm. At his arraignment the next day, he was released after posting 10 per cent of his $100,000 bail. Dail later recanted his initial statement to police and currently refuses to comment. </p> <p>Only a day earlier, Eminem had been charged, on a separate incident, with assault and carrying a concealed weapon. Those charges related to a fight the previous weekend, when he allegedly saw a barman kissing his wife, Kimberley Mathers, outside a Detroit night club. Prosecutors say Eminem pistol-whipped the man with an unloaded weapon. He faces nine years in prison if convicted on both counts. </p> <p>The charges have done his career little harm - a summer tour of the US, starting in a fortnight, is already selling out fast. And in the past three weeks, MTV has dedicated at least four special programmes to the rapper, culminating in an Eminem Weekend last week; coverage which beats anything it has given any other rapper in its history. That MTV is a regular provider of anti-violence public announcements seems to have hardly bothered the programmers. </p> <p>The validity of Eminem's music is unquestioned in the US media - despite civil rights groups charging him with glorifying homophobia and violence against women. His latest album is full of trademark slurs; his wife, mother, and teenie-singer Christina Aguilera all have their characters assassinated. </p> <p> 'Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch chairs with me </p> <p>So I could sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst </p> <p>And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first' </p> <p><strong> Eminem, 'The Real Slim Shady'</strong> </p> <p> 'Eminem's defence of his lyrics is that he makes use of fictional characters who only speak their mind. We don't think that's a viable defence for homophobia,' says Steve Spurgeon, Director of Communications for Glaad, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. '[This album] contains the most blatantly offensive homophobic lyrics we have ever heard. Ever. We can't bring ourselves to condone it merely on his right to self-expression.' </p> <p>Glaad's position on Eminem is unusual - the organisation rarely advocates censorship. Eminem's critics, however, cite his lionisation as the first white rapper to transcend race in the music sub-genre. 'He's a role model for teenagers,' continues Spurgeon. 'His opinions have to be questioned.' </p> <p> 'Some bitch asked for my autograph </p> <p>I called her a whore, spit in her face and laughed... </p> <p>All bitches is ho's, even my stinkin'-ass Mom' <br><strong> Eminem, 'Under The Influence'</strong> </p> <p> Eminem grew up in Warren, a squalid suburb on the outskirts of Detroit. The city boasts a burgeoning rap scene, due to a large black population. The young Marshall Mathers quickly distinguished himself on the local rap scene in the mid-Nineties; excelling at local competitions where participants were encouraged to trade battle rhymes against each other. </p> <p>Eminem's debut album, 1995's Infinite, was little-noticed on its release, and the rapper would almost certainly have faded into obscurity. But a demo sent to a Los Angeles radio station ended up in the hands of rap producer Dr Dre who landed Eminem a production deal. Dre, the mentor of rappers Ice Cube and Snoop Doggy Dogg, signed Eminem to his label, Aftermath, and the X-rated album, The Slim Shady LP, went on to sell over three million copies amid a storm of controversy. Even the old chestnut 'His own mother couldn't love him' could be accurately applied to Eminem, as his Mom, stung by the merciless attacks on her morals in the album's lyrics, initiated a million-dollar lawsuit against her son. </p> <p>Accolades were almost immediate - in the US media, Eminem has already been cited as the first articulate blue-collar musician since Nirvana's Kurt Cobain. Rock magazines such as Rolling Stone and Spin have acclaimed him as a white-trash poet - part Muhammad Ali, part Lenny Bruce. The mainstream charts, say his defenders, are currently held hostage by teenage boy-bands. Eminem's music, likened to an updated version of the dustbowl blues, provides adult relief. The critics have been so unanimous and euphoric in their praise for his lyrics that they seem to have backed themselves into a liberal corner; in music-press circles it is almost heresy to draw attention to Eminem's homophobia and misogyny. </p> <p> 'New Kids On The Block suck a lot of dick </p> <p>Boy-girl groups make me sick </p> <p>And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public - I'ma love it </p> <p>Talkin' about I fabricated my past </p> <p>He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass' <br><strong> Eminem, 'Marshall Mathers'</strong> </p> <p> Yet Eminem's true-blue rants plough an unfamiliar territory, even in the annals of rap music. His music highlights a genuine self-loathing unique to his apolitical generation. Gangsta rappers before him have unleashed broadsides at their enemies, but they were always limited to civic institutions such as the police or government. In Eminem's case, anyone - even his fans - is fodder for his hatred. It makes for extremely entertaining but ultimately worrying listening - a soundtrack to a life that celebrates its lack of redemption. </p> <p>'The US pop industry is currently obsessed with the teenage market,' says Rolling Stone writer David Fricke. 'Even our magazine regularly cover groups like the Backstreet Boys and N'Sync. Eminem seems to be about the last stand against all the homogeneity.' </p> <p>'If Eminem wants to express views that are homophobic, he has every right to. If he's anti-feminist, then that's his prerogative,' says Joan E. Bertin, executive director of the New York-based National Coalition Against Censorship. A free-speech advocate for 25 years, the NCAC has ardently endorsed several generations of popular musicians - Bertin cites shock-rockers Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne and Marilyn Manson as her most high-profile campaigns. </p> <p>'Personally, I would not advocate the kinds of statements that Eminem makes,' says Bertin. 'But I also disagree with censorship of any kind - I have a real problem with anyone who tries to enforce a general consensus.

Gays and lesbians are often the most censored group in our society - why advocate censorship of anyone else as a remedy?' </p> <p>The stringency with which US rock critics have mounted Eminem's defence rankles with some rap writers who view his lighter treatment as evidence of the US music industry's inherent racism. Generations of black rap bands have, in recent years, been subject to public humiliation by right-wing focus groups determined to halt the rise of America's largest pop sales sector. </p> <p>'Black rappers are regularly vilified for expressing similar views,' says Nelson George, author of Hip Hop America.

      "bodyText": "Two weeks ago, US rapper Eminem's second album, The Marshall Mathers LP, soared to the top of the US charts. When the first week's sales figures were released, few could dispute the Detroit rapper's arrival as a major-league player. The album - featuring tales of rape, shootings, drug overdoses and throat-slittings - shifted 1.7 million units in only seven days, making it the fastest-selling rap album ever. Such sales seemed to vindicate the opinions of US rock critics who, for the most part, have been wildly enthusiastic about the rapper's work. On the release of the new album, Newsweek explained away Eminem's misogyny by noting with approval: 'Eminem [is] arguably the most compelling figure in all of pop music. He picks on himself almost as much as he does the people on his enemies list. By flipping his razor-sharp lyrics on himself, Eminem subverts the smirking superiority that plagues mainstream rap, a wily underdog move that lets him get away with more than he could otherwise.' The LA Times gushed: 'Eminem is simply exercising his creative impulses - putting on disc all the forbidden thoughts and scandalous scenarios that accompany adolescence and just watching the fallout.' 'My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me For a gift I had 10 of my boys take her virginity And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was asleep' Eminem, 'Amityville' In recent weeks Eminem's supposedly satirical take on gangsta rap has begun to seem less of a joke. On 8 June, he was charged for allegedly brandishing a gun at Douglas Dail, a member of rap group Insane Clown Posse, in Detroit. Eminem was charged with possession of a concealed weapon and brandishing of a firearm. At his arraignment the next day, he was released after posting 10 per cent of his $100,000 bail. Dail later recanted his initial statement to police and currently refuses to comment. Only a day earlier, Eminem had been charged, on a separate incident, with assault and carrying a concealed weapon. Those charges related to a fight the previous weekend, when he allegedly saw a barman kissing his wife, Kimberley Mathers, outside a Detroit night club. Prosecutors say Eminem pistol-whipped the man with an unloaded weapon. He faces nine years in prison if convicted on both counts. The charges have done his career little harm - a summer tour of the US, starting in a fortnight, is already selling out fast. And in the past three weeks, MTV has dedicated at least four special programmes to the rapper, culminating in an Eminem Weekend last week; coverage which beats anything it has given any other rapper in its history. That MTV is a regular provider of anti-violence public announcements seems to have hardly bothered the programmers.

Someone tells him that the country is in mourning thanks to England's desultory performance against Portugal. Dell looks curious. 'Do you think it wouldn't have been so bad if you'd lost to a bigger team?' he asks with genuine interest. </p> <p>It is a revealing moment. For Michael Dell, who started flogging upgraded IBM PCs to his college mates at Austin University in Texas at the age of 18, winning is everything. You don't turn your company into the world's largest direct computer systems supplier with a market value of $120 billion and sales for the last four quarters of $27bn by being anything other than abnormally focused on reaching the number one slot. </p> <p>But Dell is relaxed over lunch, making goofy jokes about his competitors and, at the same time, he is drumming home the Dell message. He seems more reachable than most of his fellow computer billionaires. There is none of the remoteness of Microsoft's Bill Gates or the flamboyance of Oracle's Larry Ellison. </p> <p>And yet although he seems unassuming, Dell clearly knows how to play hard ball. As a teenager he made money organising stamp auctions before moving on to sell newspapers. He started Dell in 1985 with $1,000, dropping out of his biology course to focus on building his company from the bottom up. </p> <p>The company's success has been based on what looks now to be an obvious premise. Sell to the customer direct and strip out the cumbersome middleman who takes a cut for selling your product. Back in the Eighties this was a revolutionary decision. Initially the PCs were sold over the phone. The emergence of the internet gave the company the ability to go global. </p> <p>Dell's competitors, chiefly arch rival Compaq, the world's largest supplier of PCs, have been worrying what to do about its sales methods ever since. Compaq wants to increase its direct sales volumes, but this will antagonise its salesmen. Compaq is still attempting to resolve this tension, a task which has already cost it a CEO and several other executives. In the interim Dell is making hay while the sun shines. </p> <p>Or at least it has been. Dell might exude bonhomie, but he knows his company can't stay still. Fears about a bottoming out of the PC market have taken their toll on the company's share price. Last month Dell unveiled its worst set of results since 1994. Back then its share price slid 54 per cent. Last month it gave up more than 20 per cent as Wall Street tried to second-guess what Dell, who owns more than 14 per cent of the company, will do next. </p> <p>Dell's pay packet took a hammering as a result. In the financial year to 28 January, his salary, complete with share options and bonuses, came to a paltry $14 million. Paltry that is if compared to the $109m he made the previous year. </p> <p>Dell believes all the hype about the PC being dead is overdone. Well he would, wouldn't he? </p> <p>But there is logic in his argument, which is, to summarise: soon we won't have to access the internet through phone lines. New developments in wireless technology provide new opportunities. But we will still need servers - the bits of equipment that guide traffic around the internet and direct us to web sites - to handle all of this. This is good news for Dell which wants to corner the server market. </p> <p>More than 40 per cent of the growth in the global server market came from Dell. And Dell adds: 'Handsets are not going to need all that extra bandwidth. But 3lb Dell notebooks that you can use anywhere are made for that sort of thing. That's a very exciting prospect. We don't plan on going into the phone business.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, Dell Ventures, the company's venture capital arm set up with a $6bn war chest, is on the prowl in wireless-wise Europe, looking to buy into some of the emerging companies which will shape the mobile world of tomorrow. </p> <p>'If there are any companies out there that want to be considered, they should submit their business plans now,' Dell says wryly. </p> <p>He might be a keen advocate of the PC but, significantly, Dell hints that the company is looking at the personal digital assistant (PDA) market. 'It's interesting,' are two words which might make the likes of 3Com shudder. Dell is already working with Psion on developing a range of Bluetooth technologies that allow different devices to connect to each other without wires. </p> <p>Dell Ventures, which Dell is adamant won't be floated off ('it's fundamental to our business'), is only one example of the way the company is trying to diversify. It is also developing a network of e-business partnerships with the likes of Arthur Andersen so that it can offer its clients services rather than just hardware. </p> <p>The underlying point, however, is not hard to grasp. Apart from the fact that selling services is a huge growth area, by creating a network of alliances Dell also cleverly opens up a new sales channel. The partners sell the clients some services and, while they are about it, how about some Dell hardware with it? </p> <p>Dell likens the internet to electricity in terms of its importance. And, as with electricity, too much intervention, he believes is dangerous. On Tuesday Dell met Tony Blair for a discussion on the internet. Dell used the meeting to protest against suggestions that the internet should be subject to new forms of taxation, obviously a key concern for a company which makes the majority of its money by selling online. 'There shouldn't be a discriminatory tax system. We're not asking for subsidies, but we're just saying there shouldn't be new taxes.' </p> <p>Taxing the internet is a remote threat to Dell. More worrying is the position Dell will be left in if Microsoft is broken up. Perhaps more than any other company in the world, Dell owes a thank- you to Microsoft for creating an established set of industry standards and allowing the world's PCs to talk to each other, thus ensuring their proliferation. </p> <p>Dell is sanguine about a break-up. 'The key issue for us is this - is it going to change the demand for our products? Customers who like Microsoft are going to buy from it if it is two companies rather than one.' </p> <p>And, in an obvious rebuke to the US government for meddling in the business affairs of successful companies, Dell says: 'If we were looking for an organisation to design software for us, the Justice Department would be pretty low on our list.' His support for Microsoft is understandable given Dell's psychology. Michael Dell likes winners.</p>",

Customers who like Microsoft are going to buy from it if it is two companies rather than one.' And, in an obvious rebuke to the US government for meddling in the business affairs of successful companies, Dell says: 'If we were looking for an organisation to design software for us, the Justice Department would be pretty low on our list.' His support for Microsoft is understandable given Dell's psychology. Michael Dell likes winners.",

      "body": "<p>The golden rule of forecasting is never to make a short-term prediction - meaning any period of time in which your crass stupidity might be rumbled. Number of digital TV homes in five years' time, by all means. Audience share for BBC television in 2010, certainly. By then, the next generation of microchip technology will have saved you from embarrassment. </p> <p>But rules are for breaking, so here, in true kamikaze fashion, is a prediction that will be rendered true or false within 24 hours of its appearance. It concerns the England v Germany match. Not the silly game between 22 players on the pitch, whose result will be at least 12 hours old by the time you read this, but the keenly anticipated on-screen battle between the BBC's Gary and ITV's Des. </p> <p>I predict that Gary will wipe the floor with Des by a margin approaching two to one. Even with the doyen of football presentation on its side, ITV will trail a poor second in the ratings battle. This has nothing to do with superior presentation, line-up of pundits, or pre-match scheduling. It's all about history, tradition and branding. </p> <p>As a national institution, the BBC remains the place to go for other national institutions: royal weddings, royal birthdays (usually), general elections, millennium celebrations, national sporting disasters and the occasional sporting triumph. What started as a monopolistic obligation has become one of the great defining elements of the modern BBC, setting it apart from the growing band of commercial operators desperate to grab our attention. Whenever there's a choice, it's still Auntie who gets our vote for the great occasion. </p> <p>This is something the Premier League forgot this week, and football may suffer the consequences. Soccer is the national sport, and Match of the Day has been another national institution which in its own way has enhanced and enriched the national game. Football has benefited not just from its availability every Saturday night to virtually every household in the country, but from its association with the BBC brand name. The game itself will still be universally available after next season, and probably a lot earlier than on the BBC. But Match of the Day will be gone. </p> <p>In its place will be a different brand with a different set of values, more associated with the need to attract as many viewers with bulging wallets as possible. No doubt ITV coverage will be just as technically advanced and well produced - probably better. Behind every programme, however, will be a sneaking suspicion that it needs to pull off some smart commercial tricks to justify that annual investment of \u00a360 million. Will the fans think that ITV is treating soccer as a national treasure, a game to be loved and cherished? Or as a commodity to be exploited and hyped in order to recoup at least some percentage of its huge bid? </p> <p>To those who think the importance of channel branding is nonsense if the on-screen 'product' is identical, I offer one nugget of television sports trivia: between 1985 and 1986 the audience for the Derby plummeted from 4.4 million viewers to 1.7 million - not because the race was shifted to 7am but because coverage moved from ITV to Channel 4. Of course, there's a world of difference between a minority channel barely four years old and a mass entertainment channel with a 45-year history - but ratings for soccer highlights will fall, and there will be no more reward points from an association with the BBC brand. </p> <p>This depends on the BBC brand actually surviving. Given this week's announcement from wunderkind director of television Mark Thompson that BBC television should be reorganised into 'genre-based' channels, this is by no means certain. </p> <p>The prospect of a BBC1 devoted entirely to light entertainment, while anything remotely challenging or cerebral is shunted off to BBC2, will not enhance the public broadcaster's reputation for offering quality and diversity across the board. The assumption is that the new 'suite' of channels will continue to fulfil the BBC's commitments. In practice, BBC1 will begin to look uncomfortably similar to ITV, while current affairs and documentary programmes will be unable to profit from audiences inherited from mass appeal programmes. </p> <p>It will then be just a matter of time before we hear calls for the privatisation of BBC1, leaving a marginalised BBC2 doing the kinds of 'worthy' things some people think is all a public broadcaster ought to be doing anyway. At that point - and here's a prediction that obeys the golden rule - we can kiss goodbye to the BBC brand value that makes it not just a quality national asset but provides an aspirational benchmark for other broadcasters. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:s.barnett@wmin.ac.uk\">s.barnett@wmin.ac.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The golden rule of forecasting is never to make a short-term prediction - meaning any period of time in which your crass stupidity might be rumbled. Number of digital TV homes in five years' time, by all means. Audience share for BBC television in 2010, certainly. By then, the next generation of microchip technology will have saved you from embarrassment. But rules are for breaking, so here, in true kamikaze fashion, is a prediction that will be rendered true or false within 24 hours of its appearance. It concerns the England v Germany match. Not the silly game between 22 players on the pitch, whose result will be at least 12 hours old by the time you read this, but the keenly anticipated on-screen battle between the BBC's Gary and ITV's Des. I predict that Gary will wipe the floor with Des by a margin approaching two to one. Even with the doyen of football presentation on its side, ITV will trail a poor second in the ratings battle. This has nothing to do with superior presentation, line-up of pundits, or pre-match scheduling. It's all about history, tradition and branding. As a national institution, the BBC remains the place to go for other national institutions: royal weddings, royal birthdays (usually), general elections, millennium celebrations, national sporting disasters and the occasional sporting triumph. What started as a monopolistic obligation has become one of the great defining elements of the modern BBC, setting it apart from the growing band of commercial operators desperate to grab our attention. Whenever there's a choice, it's still Auntie who gets our vote for the great occasion. This is something the Premier League forgot this week, and football may suffer the consequences. Soccer is the national sport, and Match of the Day has been another national institution which in its own way has enhanced and enriched the national game. Football has benefited not just from its availability every Saturday night to virtually every household in the country, but from its association with the BBC brand name. The game itself will still be universally available after next season, and probably a lot earlier than on the BBC. But Match of the Day will be gone. In its place will be a different brand with a different set of values, more associated with the need to attract as many viewers with bulging wallets as possible. No doubt ITV coverage will be just as technically advanced and well produced - probably better. Behind every programme, however, will be a sneaking suspicion that it needs to pull off some smart commercial tricks to justify that annual investment of \u00a360 million. Will the fans think that ITV is treating soccer as a national treasure, a game to be loved and cherished? Or as a commodity to be exploited and hyped in order to recoup at least some percentage of its huge bid? To those who think the importance of channel branding is nonsense if the on-screen 'product' is identical, I offer one nugget of television sports trivia: between 1985 and 1986 the audience for the Derby plummeted from 4.4 million viewers to 1.7 million - not because the race was shifted to 7am but because coverage moved from ITV to Channel 4. Of course, there's a world of difference between a minority channel barely four years old and a mass entertainment channel with a 45-year history - but ratings for soccer highlights will fall, and there will be no more reward points from an association with the BBC brand. This depends on the BBC brand actually surviving. Given this week's announcement from wunderkind director of television Mark Thompson that BBC television should be reorganised into 'genre-based' channels, this is by no means certain. The prospect of a BBC1 devoted entirely to light entertainment, while anything remotely challenging or cerebral is shunted off to BBC2, will not enhance the public broadcaster's reputation for offering quality and diversity across the board. The assumption is that the new 'suite' of channels will continue to fulfil the BBC's commitments. In practice, BBC1 will begin to look uncomfortably similar to ITV, while current affairs and documentary programmes will be unable to profit from audiences inherited from mass appeal programmes. It will then be just a matter of time before we hear calls for the privatisation of BBC1, leaving a marginalised BBC2 doing the kinds of 'worthy' things some people think is all a public broadcaster ought to be doing anyway. At that point - and here's a prediction that obeys the golden rule - we can kiss goodbye to the BBC brand value that makes it not just a quality national asset but provides an aspirational benchmark for other broadcasters. s.barnett@wmin.ac.uk",

      "body": "<p>The vacuum cleaner was invented by an asthmatic janitor from Ohio called Murray Spangler - and it was his brother-in-law, William Hoover, who built factories and gave a name to the world's first electric labour-saving device. </p> <p>But after nearly a century of cleaning up, Hoover has lost its sparkle, not least because of competition from the inventive James Dyson, who moved the goalposts with his bagless, brightly coloured vacuum cleaners. </p> <p>The Hoover company, formed in 1908, coined the jingle 'It beats as it sweeps as it cleans'. As well as selling by the million, the machine went on to become the first mass-produced mod con to become a verb. </p> <p>By the Nineties it was looking for marketing ploys, and came up with the infamous 1992 advertising gimmick which offered consumers two free air tickets for every \u00a3100 spent on Hoover products. </p> <p>It seemed like a good idea at the time. But the trouble was that the offer was open-ended rather than first-come-first-served - and 600,000 people lined up for their tickets. </p> <p>The cost to Hoover's former US owner, Maytag, is not known - it is at least \u00a325 million, and probably nearer \u00a350m. Maytag was forced to sell the company - it initially offered it for \u00a31 but, when there were no takers, Jerry Kamman was parachuted in. </p> <p>He slashed marketing budgets, trimmed the workforce, increased Hoover's unit prices and built up stock. The company appeared to be making money. It was sold for \u00a3100m to Candy, a northern Italian family-run concern. Candy today admits it overpaid. </p> <p>After the free flights fiasco came Dyson's reinvention of the vacuum cleaner in 1993. Dyson's Cyclone has cleaned up in a market worth \u00a3455m here. His slice is now more than \u00a3200m annually. </p> <p>Overseas consumers are still not convinced that the Cyclone bagless system sucks up more dust than a conventional disposable bag. Consumer tests tend to back this up. Vacuum cleaners now are equipped with motors up to 70 per cent more powerful than before Dyson came on the scene. </p> <p>But although competitors, including Hoover, at first slated Dyson, they have now brought out similar products. </p> <p>And that's where Hoover's final problem comes in. Dyson has taken a string of competitors to court over their advertising claims and alleged copyright infringements. </p> <p>On 17 July he will claim in the High Court that Hoover's Vortex bagless machine has infringed his copyright. If found guilty, Hoover could be forced to withdraw its machine. For its 3,000 UK workers in south Wales and Merseyside, that would spell disaster. </p> <p>Although Hoover has been reluctant to face the press since the tickets debacle, its Italian managing director, Alberto Bertali, has now decided that the time has come for him to move out of the shadows. </p> <p>The 56-year-old has spent much of his working life away from home: first in Turkey, and then since 1995 in this country. Hoover , he says, has been 'quite a big challenge' - by which, one gets the impression, he means that it has been the biggest battle of his life. </p> <p>Candy bought the company but did not inherit any liability for the ticket fiasco, which for a while made the company the country's biggest supplier of holidays. </p> <p>'It wasn't ill-conceived,' he says. 'It was ill-managed. Basically it was the reason we managed to buy Hoover.' From a distance, Bertali had looked on in amazement as news of the free ticket fall-out spread throughout the world. 'On a \u00a3100 sale, they could only make \u00a315 profit. We were scratching our heads.' On assuming control of Hoover in 1995, he had to field calls from disgruntled consumers. Cases are still coming to court. </p> <p>But a greater headache was the antiquated factories, starved of investment. Bertali persuaded his chairman, Peppino Fumagalli, to invest \u00a320m in its plants and cut unit prices by 25 per cent. </p> <p>Hoover this year made its first profit since the fiasco, but Bertali believes it would have returned to profit earlier had it not been for the strong pound. Exports account for 40 per cent of output, so the strength of sterling 'is a sore point that is really killing us'. </p> <p>Two years ago, Hoover cancelled contracts with local suppliers and started importing parts. 'It was a pure currency thing.' </p> <p>Government officials intervened. 'They tried to convince us it was the euro that was weak rather than the pound. It's partly true. Since the euro was created, it has lost 15 per cent. But the pound has lost roughly 30 per cent against the lira and the mark.' </p> <p>Bertali acknowledges that currency fluctuations are now likely 'to go his way', but says the UK has to join the euro. If not, industry already in decline will wither. 'There's no doubt.' </p> <p>Hoover for one would consider scaling down its UK operation if Britain refused to join Euroland. </p> <p>'We have invested heavily here,' Bertali said. 'We employ 3,000 people, so it's not an easy decision to pull out. But we've got to consider seriously where to invest.' </p> <p>'Okay, you can buy forwards, you can export more - but at the end of the day you've got to pay salaries in pounds. There are costs you cannot minimise and I think we won't be competitive. I don't think we'll pull out, but perhaps there will be a slow demise.' </p> <p>But it is Dyson who looms largest in Bertali's mind at the moment. </p> <p>Hoover allowed him to get an initial foothold in the market by not rushing out a similar bagless model, he concedes. Candy was preoccupied with getting Hoover on an even keel, and it had no experience in vacuum cleaner manufacturing. </p> <p>'We let him grow,' Bertali says ruefully. 'He's captured now almost 50 per cent of the market, so at a certain point you have to react, otherwise he would have got 100 per cent.' </p> <p>Bertali is confident that he will win the wrangle over alleged copyright infringement. He claims his bagless device uses a patent from a company specialising in gas and oil separation. In addition, 'everyone is jumping on the [bagless] bandwagon'. What's more, the Dyson licence has, he says, only one year to run. </p> <p>Dyson has already won the war, regardless of the copyright decision. He has redefined the market and created a new one while others look cumbersome as they play catch-up. </p> <p>Hoover is one of the most enduring brands of the twentieth century. But maybe it should consider a massive rebrand if it is to avoid collecting dust in the next one.</p>",

Bertali persuaded his chairman, Peppino Fumagalli, to invest \u00a320m in its plants and cut unit prices by 25 per cent. Hoover this year made its first profit since the fiasco, but Bertali believes it would have returned to profit earlier had it not been for the strong pound. Exports account for 40 per cent of output, so the strength of sterling 'is a sore point that is really killing us'. Two years ago, Hoover cancelled contracts with local suppliers and started importing parts. 'It was a pure currency thing.' Government officials intervened. 'They tried to convince us it was the euro that was weak rather than the pound. It's partly true. Since the euro was created, it has lost 15 per cent. But the pound has lost roughly 30 per cent against the lira and the mark.' Bertali acknowledges that currency fluctuations are now likely 'to go his way', but says the UK has to join the euro. If not, industry already in decline will wither. 'There's no doubt.' Hoover for one would consider scaling down its UK operation if Britain refused to join Euroland. 'We have invested heavily here,' Bertali said. 'We employ 3,000 people, so it's not an easy decision to pull out. But we've got to consider seriously where to invest.' 'Okay, you can buy forwards, you can export more - but at the end of the day you've got to pay salaries in pounds. There are costs you cannot minimise and I think we won't be competitive. I don't think we'll pull out, but perhaps there will be a slow demise.' But it is Dyson who looms largest in Bertali's mind at the moment. Hoover allowed him to get an initial foothold in the market by not rushing out a similar bagless model, he concedes. Candy was preoccupied with getting Hoover on an even keel, and it had no experience in vacuum cleaner manufacturing. 'We let him grow,' Bertali says ruefully. 'He's captured now almost 50 per cent of the market, so at a certain point you have to react, otherwise he would have got 100 per cent.' Bertali is confident that he will win the wrangle over alleged copyright infringement. He claims his bagless device uses a patent from a company specialising in gas and oil separation. In addition, 'everyone is jumping on the [bagless] bandwagon'. What's more, the Dyson licence has, he says, only one year to run. Dyson has already won the war, regardless of the copyright decision. He has redefined the market and created a new one while others look cumbersome as they play catch-up. Hoover is one of the most enduring brands of the twentieth century. But maybe it should consider a massive rebrand if it is to avoid collecting dust in the next one.",

The corroded machines are immovable testimonies to the connections between scarce, natural resources and some of the world's most violent conflicts. </p> <p>Most of Angola's diamond mining industry has been under the control of Unita rebels for much of the past decade, giving them an income of $3.7 billion. Between 1992 and 1998, the country's government has in return used the income it receives from the world's oil companies each year, estimated to be between $1.8bn and $3bn, to buy weapons and pay its army. More than 90 per cent of the Angolan government's income comes from oil. </p> <p>The amount of money being spent by both sides represents a colossal and tragic waste of money, almost impossible to comprehend.

More than 80 per cent of Angolans live in poverty. The country's president, Eduardo Dos Santos, was forced to admit as much in 1997 when he said: 'Two thirds of the Angolan population live on less than a dollar a day.' </p> <p>The UN has slapped an embargo on Angolan diamonds, and the big-name mining companies, such as De Beers, have severed their ties. </p> <p>However the precious gems are still finding their way out of the country. Angolan diamonds are now being sold through one company - a company which is partly owned by a man who has for the best part of a decade kept the country's government in arms. </p> <p>Diamonds are big at the moment. The conflict in Sierra Leone was initially sparked by a desire of Charles Taylor, the ruler of Liberia, to control his neighbouring country's diamond reserves. </p> <p>And now the focus has shifted to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Last week The Observer revealed how the Foreign Office had stepped into the row surrounding mining firm Oryx, which was looking to float on London's Alternative Investment Market. The firm, which has a concession to mine in the Mbuji Mayi area of the DRC, has attracted attention because of its close links with the Zimbabwean and Congolese governments, which have profit-sharing agreements with Oryx. </p> <p>Oryx disputes that it is mining in a conflict zone; Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain disagrees. Oryx feels hard done by. It is a relatively small company operating in an area which is also being mined by a Belgian firm partly owned by diamond giant De Beers. Nevertheless the spotlight on Oryx is understandable given the attention already being paid to the actions of Robert Mugabe's government and the bitter fighting in Kisangani in the east of the DRC. </p> <p>But it also diverts attention from the wider picture. Everywhere you look, the DRC is being plundered of its natural resources. The Rwandan army seized many of the region's tantalite mines. Tantalite is used in the production of gun barrels. Likewise, the gold mines are coming under control of both Ugandan and Rwandan forces. Meanwhile, a railway line connects several copper mines to Zambia. The copper is taken from the DRC to Zambia where, according to pressure group Global Witness, it is picked up by Zimbabwean troops. </p> <p>Global Witness, set up in 1993, highlights the links between conflict and natural resources, points out that what is happening in parts of the DRC is nothing new. </p> <p>Throughout the early Nineties the Khmer Rouge made up to $20 million a year to keep itself in arms by selling timber to Thai government and military officials. The Khmer Rouge also did very well offloading sapphires and rubies mined near its stronghold in Pailin. </p> <p>The Cambodian government, during the latter half of the last decade, signed secret illegal deals to allow Vietnamese loggers to fell Cambodian timber, much of which was subsequently made into garden furniture and sold across Europe under bogus 'environment-friendly' labels. The money found its way into the pockets of key military officials who were instrumental in establishing a coup d'etat in 1997. </p> <p>According to Global Witness, in 1996 the Cambodian government was making around $100m a year from selling timber-felling concessions. Today, because of extensive deforestation, that government is lucky if it makes around a fifth of what it was earning four years ago. Gleaning such figures is no easy task. One of the main problems analysts face when trying to work out to what extent the trade in a particular natural resource is helping fuel a conflict is that, for obvious reasons, no one is sure exactly where the money is going. </p> <p>Take the acquisition of oil drilling rights in Angola for example. In July last year, the Angolan government awarded the rights to three deep-water oil blocks to consortia led by BP-Amoco, Elf Aquitaine and Exxon respectively. Global Witness believes a high proportion of the $900m 'signature bonus' (the money paid upfront) went straight into the pockets of the Angolan presidency. Unfortunately none of the oil companies gives detailed breakdowns of how much it spends on acquiring concessions on a country-by-country basis, so working out where the money flows is almost impossible. </p> <p>Last year the Foreign Office's Hain acknowledged this when he stated in a speech at the School of Oriental and African Studies that: 'The oil companies who work in Angola, like BP-Amoco, Elf, Total and Exxon - and the diamond traders like De Beers - should be open with the international community and the international financial institutions so that it is clear these revenues are not siphoned off but are invested in the country.' </p> <p>An admirable sentiment, but one which so far looks impossible to achieve. None of the oil companies is prepared to give detailed breakdowns in its accounts - unless its competitors do the same. </p> <p>'It would take little more than a change in accounting practices,' said Simon Taylor, a director of Global Witness. 'You could apply it to all the other extractive industries.' </p> <p>But if the companies themselves are reluctant to take the initiative, there are at least tentative signs that the world's governments are becoming more serious about clamping down on the trade between weapons and scarce natural resources. </p> <p>Last week the EU blocked a \u00a335m aid package to Liberia because of its government's involvement in supplying rebel forces in Sierra Leone with arms in return for diamonds. And France, which currently holds the presidency of the UN Security Council, has started to express an interest in how Laurent Kabila, President of the DRC, funds his army's fight against rebel forces. </p> <p>There is now also a real chance that a global certification system to register the provenance of each diamond is set to become a reality.

Since legislation in the Eighties, ballots are compulsory before a strike is called. </p> <p>Figures out last month showed that union membership was rising after years of decline. And earlier this month a compulsory union recognition process came into law under the Employment Relations Act. </p> <p>The TUC figures show that unions carried out 983 ballots for industrial action in the year from last June, compared with 464 the previous year. </p> <p>Of last year's ballots, 126 became full-blown industrial action, while 155 strikes resulted from this year's votes. </p> <p>TUC officials say ballots are producing votes for strike action in 95 per cent of cases, indicating that unions were managing the process better than in the past. Such tactics were used, for example, in a dispute where management wanted to put closed-circuit TV cameras into a factory. </p> <p>Managers backed down after a pro-strike ballot by the Manufacturing Science Finance union.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The days of wildcat strikes may be over, but unions are getting ever cannier at using the spectre of industrial action to bargain for better working conditions with their employers. Figures collected by the Trades Union Congress for a Trade Union Trends survey out on Thursday show that the number of ballots for industrial action has almost doubled in the last year, while the number of strikes has remained roughly flat. The TUC concludes that unions are using strike bal lots to win better deals for their workers without resorting to stoppages. General Secretary John Monks said: 'The figures will show that unions are acting effectively for their members without causing unnecessary disruption. 'There is no conflict between effectiveness and responsibility in today's modern unions.' Unions argue that the figures prove that they are acting responsibly - against a background of recent events indicating that their power is at last on the increase after nearly two decades in the industrial wilderness. Since legislation in the Eighties, ballots are compulsory before a strike is called. Figures out last month showed that union membership was rising after years of decline. And earlier this month a compulsory union recognition process came into law under the Employment Relations Act. The TUC figures show that unions carried out 983 ballots for industrial action in the year from last June, compared with 464 the previous year. Of last year's ballots, 126 became full-blown industrial action, while 155 strikes resulted from this year's votes. TUC officials say ballots are producing votes for strike action in 95 per cent of cases, indicating that unions were managing the process better than in the past. Such tactics were used, for example, in a dispute where management wanted to put closed-circuit TV cameras into a factory. Managers backed down after a pro-strike ballot by the Manufacturing Science Finance union.",

So great is his enthusiasm that two years ago he cut a day off his working week in order to spend more time at his piano. He is now planning to reduce it by another day from January. This means he will be working three days a week at the University of North London, where he provides computer training for primary school teachers. </p> <p>It is not that there is not enough to do at work. On the contrary, Paul says giving up now is difficult because of the growing emphasis on technology in schools. He has delayed his further cut from September until next January because of his department's workload. </p> <p>But he feels taking time off is the only way to go where he wants with his music. He has already noticed the difference: 'It has been beneficial, not only in performance terms but in an increased sense of well being.' </p> <p>Nevertheless he admits to concern about finances. He has been getting some gigs, but he admits: 'You don't make a fortune from jazz.' When he cuts his days, his salary will reduce by a further 25 per cent. Although he hopes to supplement his income by building up his own freelance database and website design business, called Soft and Sound, he admits he has not made much headway so far in his one free day a week. </p> <p>It is the longer term he is more worried about, in particular mortgage and pension. His mortgage is on a fixed rate of 3.89 per cent until September, when he faces a considerable hike in payments. He is repaying the loan through a number of endowments - one with Sun Alliance due to mature in 2008, and two with Norwich Union paying out in 2010. But with all the bad publicity about endowments, he is not sure whether these will produce enough to pay off his remaining mortgage. </p> <p>He owns 800 Norwich Union shares (worth \u00a33,500-\u00a34,000), 100 shares in Abbey National, and three small (\u00a3250) holdings in Unigate, Vocalis and the Just Group. He is planning to start an investment club soon with some friends, and thinks he will contribute \u00a350 or \u00a360 per month. </p> <p>He has been building up an occupational pension with the Teachers Pension Agency to which he has contributed 6 per cent of his salary for the past 22 years; for the past four years he has also paid \u00a3100 a month net into an AVC. He wonders if reducing his working week will limit the amount he can contribute to his AVC. </p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Sharon Linnard </strong></p> <p>Paul's decision to reduce his hours and increase his other activities could mean not only a reduced income but additional expenses as he builds up his music and internet businesses. He is also likely to see his mortgage outgoings rise when his fixed rate expires. </p> <p>If Paul finds the best option is to remain with Northern Rock on its variable rate of 7.79 per cent, the monthly cost of his mortgage will go up by about \u00a3178. So it may be best, after he has repaid his bank loan and credit card, to hold remaining money on deposit to be called upon if needed. Part of this could be held in a mini cash Isa so that interest is tax-free. Once his position is clearer, longer-term savings can be considered. </p> <p>Regular savings into an equity Isa may be advisable in addition to or instead of the investment club. An Isa should offer a greater spread, so less risk. </p> <p>Under the teachers' pension scheme, Paul's pension will be directly linked to his earnings: reducing his hours will therefore reduce the pension he receives when he retires. Continuing AVCs at \u00a3100 a month is unlikely to be a problem, but Paul should check this. </p> <p>He could also compare the projected returns from the AVC scheme with what he would get by putting this contributions into a personal pension plan. With a personal pension, he can take part of his benefits at retirement as a tax-free lump sum, whereas AVCs must normally be taken as pension.<br>\u0095 Sharon Linnard works for accountant KPMG.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Charles Levett-Scrivener</strong></p> <p>The rules for pension benefits are very complex for employees who initially work full-time and then go part-time. However, under rules to ensure that part-time workers are treated fairly, any period of part-time work must be converted into full-time equivalent. As Paul already has 20 years' full-time service, Inland Revenue limits will allow him to draw a full pension at normal retirement date, but things will be more complex if he takes early retirement. </p> <p>There is a chance that if he continues with his current AVCs, he may end up overfunding his pension. However, the Teachers' Pension Agency would be responsible for carrying out a headroom check to confirm that he is not. Once he has actual earnings from his music and freelance work he will be able to make contributions based on the stakeholder personal pension rules. </p> <p>Paul is worried that his endowments may not fully repay his mortgage. He may be pleasantly surprised with the plan that ends in 2008. Those taken out in 1990 may be more problematic, as they have not benefited much from the high returns of the 1980s. </p> <p>He will receive a cash sum from his pension, which could pick up any deficit. However, there is still a good chance that if investment returns are satisfactory over the next 10 years, the plans maturing in 2010 will fully repay his mortgage. </p> <p>\u0095 Charles Levett-Scrivener works for financial adviser Towry Law. </p> <p><strong> Advice is for guidance only.</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

He is planning to start an investment club soon with some friends, and thinks he will contribute \u00a350 or \u00a360 per month. He has been building up an occupational pension with the Teachers Pension Agency to which he has contributed 6 per cent of his salary for the past 22 years; for the past four years he has also paid \u00a3100 a month net into an AVC. He wonders if reducing his working week will limit the amount he can contribute to his AVC. Adviser 1: Sharon Linnard Paul's decision to reduce his hours and increase his other activities could mean not only a reduced income but additional expenses as he builds up his music and internet businesses. He is also likely to see his mortgage outgoings rise when his fixed rate expires. If Paul finds the best option is to remain with Northern Rock on its variable rate of 7.79 per cent, the monthly cost of his mortgage will go up by about \u00a3178. So it may be best, after he has repaid his bank loan and credit card, to hold remaining money on deposit to be called upon if needed. Part of this could be held in a mini cash Isa so that interest is tax-free. Once his position is clearer, longer-term savings can be considered. Regular savings into an equity Isa may be advisable in addition to or instead of the investment club. An Isa should offer a greater spread, so less risk. Under the teachers' pension scheme, Paul's pension will be directly linked to his earnings: reducing his hours will therefore reduce the pension he receives when he retires. Continuing AVCs at \u00a3100 a month is unlikely to be a problem, but Paul should check this. He could also compare the projected returns from the AVC scheme with what he would get by putting this contributions into a personal pension plan. With a personal pension, he can take part of his benefits at retirement as a tax-free lump sum, whereas AVCs must normally be taken as pension. \u0095 Sharon Linnard works for accountant KPMG. Adviser 2: Charles Levett-Scrivener The rules for pension benefits are very complex for employees who initially work full-time and then go part-time. However, under rules to ensure that part-time workers are treated fairly, any period of part-time work must be converted into full-time equivalent. As Paul already has 20 years' full-time service, Inland Revenue limits will allow him to draw a full pension at normal retirement date, but things will be more complex if he takes early retirement. There is a chance that if he continues with his current AVCs, he may end up overfunding his pension. However, the Teachers' Pension Agency would be responsible for carrying out a headroom check to confirm that he is not. Once he has actual earnings from his music and freelance work he will be able to make contributions based on the stakeholder personal pension rules. Paul is worried that his endowments may not fully repay his mortgage. He may be pleasantly surprised with the plan that ends in 2008. Those taken out in 1990 may be more problematic, as they have not benefited much from the high returns of the 1980s. He will receive a cash sum from his pension, which could pick up any deficit. However, there is still a good chance that if investment returns are satisfactory over the next 10 years, the plans maturing in 2010 will fully repay his mortgage. \u0095 Charles Levett-Scrivener works for financial adviser Towry Law.

Two years ago, we were brought in to look more creatively at the work going into the West End. My perspective was that there was a terrific amount of faulty work being slung into theatres in order to make an impact. We were asked to counterbalance that. Nick, who had already done every job you could name in the entertainment industry, was there to programme the theatres, whereas I came in, at 38, to travel around and find interesting work. </p> <p>Nick concentrated on producing, while I dealt with the writers and actors. I soon realised I needed more practical business experience to make it work. So that's when I moved across the corridor to be next to Nick's office. I was fascinated by what he knew. I didn't recognise his devilish sense of humour at first - the hint of green in the armour. I could see he was part of the theatrical old guard and yet someone who obviously knew everyone in the West End. </p> <p>We work well together because we both understand that you can't predict a success and that not all venues suit every play. We were able to start trying out some work in the regions, such as Hedda Gabler with Francesca Annis, which was great, but in the end not right to bring to London. We didn't feel it had the momentum. I have learned a certain caution from Nick. As a result, we have had commercial and critical hits, such as Spend, Spend, Spend , Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing and Samuel Beckett's Krapp's Last Tape . </p> <p>I brought the Beckett over from The Gate in Dublin by promising they would get artistic credit. This is how we became known as people who value the work. And productions such as Nicole Kidman in The Blue Room at the Donmar Warehouse showed you could actually take risks. </p> <p>Until I came to ACT (Associated Capital Theatres), subsidised theatre had been my life. I had worked as artistic director with the Contact Theatre company in Manchester and so I knew how to find work and develop it. Nick, though, has a grip on the terrifying financial realities, but claims he can't read a script. The truth is, we need each other's strengths. Together we have bridged the gap between subsidised quality theatre and the West End. Too much separation had grown up between them. In the end, neither Nick nor I can ever know that we have a certain hit, but you can have an instinct. My job, unlike Nick's, is never to be cynical. We are like chalk and cheese or, perhaps, Fred and Ginger. </p> <p> <strong> Nick Salmon </strong> I would say Brigid and I are more like God and Mammon. I am the professional cynic most of the time, where as she... well, whatever she is, it works. We were brought in because Associated Capital Theatres was programming rubbish and allowing theatres to go 'dark', which is very expensive indeed. </p> <p>There was a real shortage of good-quality product to fill the venues. Theatre owners cannot afford to have dark theatres. It hits our bottom line very quickly, so the temptation is always to take any work simply because it is there. </p> <p>Don't misunderstand me, though, my decisions are still absolutely commercial. It is just that this is not a predictable business, so you have to be able to take risks. </p> <p>I was very interested in John Hurt, commercially speaking and, of course, in Beckett's work. But in the end we had to go into a smaller theatre for Krapp's Last Tape because there is not a huge amount of audience interest in Beckett out there. It was a hard decision, because we had two potentially dark theatres and yet we put it into The Ambassadors in the end, which was not even our theatre. </p> <p>Brigid and I did get the quality up.

      "body": "<p>It was High Street Kensington, Jim, but not as I knew it. I was a stranger in a familiar land. Which was the idea. 'See that,' said Ann Rosen. Small and round, with an all-white crop, Ann pointed at the gap between the number 31 bus and the High Street Kensington kerb.</p> <p>'They stop away from the pavement. They shouldn't, but they do.' The bus driver - Ann's 'they' - looked worried. Then that's Ann for you. 'It depends on the driver and training,' added Ann's companion, Vera Godden. She peered out through frisbee-sized spectacles and said: 'Lots of companies are not paying for driver training.' The driver - trained or not - looked even more worried. Then that's Vera for you.</p> <p>Ann and Vera were my dates for the morning. We'd met under the clock at Hammersmith Bus Exchange. They were taking me on the buses, giving me a guided tour of public transport through older eyes and oversized glasses.</p> <p>We're all getting older. That's life. More of us are getting more of a life than ever before, though. So we are becoming 'older still'- the phrase used by Mr Tony last year when he launched Better Government For Older People. It's a two-year programme in search of 'a strategy for an ageing population'. Transport is a significant part of it. 'Being able to travel locally with ease and confidence is crucial to older people's independence and well-being,' said Mark Beauchamp, of Kensington &amp; Chelsea.</p> <p>The borough put 40 older people 'undercover' to spy on London buses, but they'll no longer talk to the press - ever since they were lampooned in a piece by Hunter Davies, a man with an unfortunate moustache whose own spring has long since turned to grumpy autumn.</p> <p>He wouldn't have dared do it to Ann and Vera, I can tell you. Both women of a maturity which would make it ungallant - maybe even impractical - to count the candles on their cake, they are 'bus spies' for the borough of Hammersmith &amp; Fulham. Like all London's pensioners, they travel free within the whole 50-mile diameter of the city's furthest reach, thanks to a Freedom Pass - available to women at 60 and men at 65. That's discriminatory, I said, ribbingly. 'Those who feel discriminated against should kick harder,' said Ann, firmly but with a grin. Vera walks awkwardly, with a slight limp. 'Tib and fib on the right leg,' she said, dismissively. She worked in the accounts department of Joe Lyons - the food manufacturer that was to Hammersmith what Ford was to Dagenham - and she worked for the Labour Party. She's now vice-chairman - her word - of the local Age Concern. Ann, a former headmistress, is chairman - again, her word - of Hammersmith's Better Government For Older People. Both are lifelong agitators. You wouldn't want to meet them in a dark committee room.</p> <p>Do you feel listened to? I asked, naively. 'We make damn sure we are,' said Ann. 'Wouldn't you pay attention to Vera?' she added, producing a list of bus routes. The ones we were to take were clearly marked, all of them new, low-floor single-deckers, built with older people in mind - buggies and wheelchairs, too.</p> <p>And take them we did, only getting lost once. We all blamed each other for that. If truth be told, we were probably distracted by the constant dialogue with fellow passengers which Ann and Vera's presence produced. 'This bus is quite nice,' volunteered a sharply dressed woman on a number 49. 'But it keeps you waiting 45 minutes at times. And some of the drivers aren't good.' On a C1 to South Ken, Vera went into battle with the driver on behalf of a registered blind person, unable to see that her free pass had gone out of date.</p> <p>Legislation has decreed that our buses should be more accessible. Privatisation, however, has meant that, while London Transport lays down the rules, each bus company comes up with its own solution. London now has 2,200 low-floor buses, more than any European city; but all of them seem to have a different lay-out, none of them ideal. Essentially, the problem is that lowering the floor at the front of the bus means there are more internal steps at the back - how else could you clamber over the engine and the wheel arches?</p> <p>The result is that the front section of the bus has to satisfy the directly contradictory needs of both the disabled and the ageing. Wheelchairs need flat, open space. Older people want seats - single ones, ideally, as they are far easier to get in and out of. Also, that flat front section is the very bit of the bus that every Londoner feels is theirs to occupy when standing up.</p> <p>So what did our two agents with a licence to bus think of the new low-floor buses? They weren't that enthusiastic, to be frank. 'That bus there is wheelchair accessible, for example,' said Ann. 'It's meant to have a sign. But it doesn't.' One had no single seats. Most did not have enough stop bells or horizontal bars. When you can't move so fast, it's important that you have something to hang on to and that a stop bell is close to hand wherever you're sitting. Of the buses we sampled, their favourite was the number 28 to Harrow Road - enough space for both older people's seats and for two wheelchairs.</p> <p>Another older person's public-transport problem, though, is something bus companies can do little about - younger people. 'Most pensioners don't travel between 3pm and 4pm,' said Ann. 'Schoolchildren!' explained Vera. 'They throw chewing gum. They kick litter. And the language!' Other passengers joined her in vociferous agreement. 'Some teenagers give up their seat,' said Ann. 'But not many.'</p> <p>Their favourite bus? Astonishingly, it's the old Routemaster, the archetypal London Transport double-decker omnibus. 'The finest,' said Vera whose husband used to build them at the old LT Chiswick Works. It might be wheelchair-unfriendly, but it has only one step up to the lower cabin. Also, it has no door, being open to the elements at the nearside rear corner. Which is perfect for Ann. 'It means I can jump off at the traffic lights at the end of my road,' she said.</p>",

More of us are getting more of a life than ever before, though. So we are becoming 'older still'- the phrase used by Mr Tony last year when he launched Better Government For Older People. It's a two-year programme in search of 'a strategy for an ageing population'. Transport is a significant part of it. 'Being able to travel locally with ease and confidence is crucial to older people's independence and well-being,' said Mark Beauchamp, of Kensington &amp; Chelsea. The borough put 40 older people 'undercover' to spy on London buses, but they'll no longer talk to the press - ever since they were lampooned in a piece by Hunter Davies, a man with an unfortunate moustache whose own spring has long since turned to grumpy autumn. He wouldn't have dared do it to Ann and Vera, I can tell you. Both women of a maturity which would make it ungallant - maybe even impractical - to count the candles on their cake, they are 'bus spies' for the borough of Hammersmith &amp; Fulham. Like all London's pensioners, they travel free within the whole 50-mile diameter of the city's furthest reach, thanks to a Freedom Pass - available to women at 60 and men at 65. That's discriminatory, I said, ribbingly. 'Those who feel discriminated against should kick harder,' said Ann, firmly but with a grin. Vera walks awkwardly, with a slight limp. 'Tib and fib on the right leg,' she said, dismissively. She worked in the accounts department of Joe Lyons - the food manufacturer that was to Hammersmith what Ford was to Dagenham - and she worked for the Labour Party. She's now vice-chairman - her word - of the local Age Concern. Ann, a former headmistress, is chairman - again, her word - of Hammersmith's Better Government For Older People. Both are lifelong agitators. You wouldn't want to meet them in a dark committee room. Do you feel listened to? I asked, naively. 'We make damn sure we are,' said Ann. 'Wouldn't you pay attention to Vera?' she added, producing a list of bus routes. The ones we were to take were clearly marked, all of them new, low-floor single-deckers, built with older people in mind - buggies and wheelchairs, too. And take them we did, only getting lost once. We all blamed each other for that. If truth be told, we were probably distracted by the constant dialogue with fellow passengers which Ann and Vera's presence produced. 'This bus is quite nice,' volunteered a sharply dressed woman on a number 49. 'But it keeps you waiting 45 minutes at times. And some of the drivers aren't good.' On a C1 to South Ken, Vera went into battle with the driver on behalf of a registered blind person, unable to see that her free pass had gone out of date. Legislation has decreed that our buses should be more accessible. Privatisation, however, has meant that, while London Transport lays down the rules, each bus company comes up with its own solution. London now has 2,200 low-floor buses, more than any European city; but all of them seem to have a different lay-out, none of them ideal. Essentially, the problem is that lowering the floor at the front of the bus means there are more internal steps at the back - how else could you clamber over the engine and the wheel arches? The result is that the front section of the bus has to satisfy the directly contradictory needs of both the disabled and the ageing. Wheelchairs need flat, open space. Older people want seats - single ones, ideally, as they are far easier to get in and out of. Also, that flat front section is the very bit of the bus that every Londoner feels is theirs to occupy when standing up. So what did our two agents with a licence to bus think of the new low-floor buses? They weren't that enthusiastic, to be frank. 'That bus there is wheelchair accessible, for example,' said Ann. 'It's meant to have a sign. But it doesn't.' One had no single seats. Most did not have enough stop bells or horizontal bars. When you can't move so fast, it's important that you have something to hang on to and that a stop bell is close to hand wherever you're sitting. Of the buses we sampled, their favourite was the number 28 to Harrow Road - enough space for both older people's seats and for two wheelchairs. Another older person's public-transport problem, though, is something bus companies can do little about - younger people. 'Most pensioners don't travel between 3pm and 4pm,' said Ann. 'Schoolchildren!' explained Vera. 'They throw chewing gum. They kick litter. And the language!' Other passengers joined her in vociferous agreement. 'Some teenagers give up their seat,' said Ann. 'But not many.' Their favourite bus? Astonishingly, it's the old Routemaster, the archetypal London Transport double-decker omnibus. 'The finest,' said Vera whose husband used to build them at the old LT Chiswick Works. It might be wheelchair-unfriendly, but it has only one step up to the lower cabin. Also, it has no door, being open to the elements at the nearside rear corner. Which is perfect for Ann. 'It means I can jump off at the traffic lights at the end of my road,' she said.",

      "body": "<p>On 29 June, Rev Michael Aikman will have been missing for exactly one year. Since he disappeared from his home in Whitstable, Kent, leaving behind his wife and two young sons, there have been no confirmed sightings of him, although his blue Ford Sierra was found abandoned a couple of days after he vanished on a clifftop at St Margaret's Bay, near Dover. He left behind a brief note in which he explained that having 'almost double-booked' two weddings, he was finding his job 'stressful' and was 'going away'. </p> <p>There was nothing in the note to suggest that he was planning to kill himself or might walk out of his old life of clerical rigour and into a new one, perhaps living as someone else, somewhere else. Aikman was 35 when he left the family home, a resonant age, in the Biblical sense that he was halfway through the journey of his life. </p> <p>He was certainly worrying about his job, but not unduly so, says his wife, Ruth. 'I remember going up to bed and the next morning coming down to find that he'd gone. He'd left the note, saying that he wanted to clear his head. I expected him to be back by lunchtime.' Twelve months on, she is waiting for him to return. 'The hardest thing is not knowing whether he will come back, whether he is living a new life, or whether he's dead. What has happened is so out of character for Michael. He really enjoyed his job and was much appreciated. I have no idea why he drove off that night.' </p> <p>Ruth Aikman is sure that her husband is alive, not because of some mystical intuition, but simply because his body has never been found. 'I think the fact that he parked his car by St Margaret's cliff was merely a coincidence.' What of the suggestion by a Scottish medium that he is 'living among New Age travellers in the Highlands? (There have been unconfirmed sightings of him in Scotland.) 'I don't know about that,' she says. 'All I want is for him to get in touch. I miss him, the children miss him. They are always asking about him. The whole thing has been incredibly painful and upsetting.' </p> <p>According to estimated figures from the National Missing Persons Bureau, as many as 250,000 people disappear in Britain every year. Many of them are teenagers and young adults, the ghostly-grey presences you see loitering in doorways and begging for 'spare change' in most major cities. But an increasing number of people are choosing to commit what in America has long been known as 'pseudocide', which means faking your own death so as to exchange one identity for another, an old life for a new. </p> <p>In his bestseller, How to Disappear Completely and Never Be Found, Doug Richmond wackily offers a series of pointers on how to commit pseudocide, including how to evade police detection, arrange for a new driving licence, get a job and how to make it appear that you left the country before disappearing altogether. </p> <p>One suspects that Richmond's eccentric book may have been adopted as a kind of self-help manual by Karl Hackett, who used the Paddington rail crash last September as an opportunity to fake his own death. What happened was macabre. On the day of the crash, someone called Lee Simm contacted the police to say that his close friend, Karl Hackett, was missing and believed to have been on the mangled train. </p> <p>Soon afterwards, Brian Hackett, Karl's father, attended a memorial service for the dead of Paddington, believing that he had discovered the truth about his son, who he had not seen for more than a decade. But police became suspicious when Hackett's body was never recovered from the wreckage. Further investigation revealed that Karl Hackett was anything but dead. Not only had he made the call to the police himself but had long since assumed a new identity and the name of an old friend, Lee Simm, who committed suicide in the mid-1980s. He even had a driving licence in that name. </p> <p>After being charged at Horseferry Road magistrates with wasting police time, Hackett said: 'People disappear every day - and some like me do it because they have had enough. You can change your name, move to a new area and start again. It tears your heart out to throw everything in the bin and start from scratch, but I've been living an honest and decent life. I've made mistakes in the past, but I don't think I should be punished for the rest of my life for what I did in my youth. This whole thing has been a nightmare, but I'm not going to start again. I'm going to stay Lee Simm.' </p> <p>There is something strangely moving about the inner turmoil of Karl Hackett, about his longing to slip out of the robes of one identity and to start again as an 'honest and decent' new man, free from past 'mistakes'. Yet in this age of computerised records and databases, where every indiscretion, health blemish and motoring offence is relentlessly logged and used against us, how difficult it is to achieve the liberation Hackett sought. And how many of us long to achieve just that! </p> <p>My own family has long been haunted by a disappearance. In my childhood, I recall whenever our extended family met up, at Christmas or on someone's birthday, how the conversation inevitably turned to Alfred Lewis, my mother's Uncle Alf, who was affectionately known as the 'wanderer'. He set out for a walk one winter weekend and never returned. He had gone, disappeared, trailing nothing but thin streams of gossip, rumour and accusation behind him. He was 25. </p> <p>On more than one occasion, men - 'fantasists' my grandmother, Alf's sister, called them - walked into police stations and claimed to be him. They actually claimed to be my missing great-uncle. 'What drives people?' I heard my mother say. 'What makes them claim to be someone they're not?' It's a good question and one to which the case of Karl Hackett-Simm perhaps provides a partial answer. </p> <p>There were many 'sightings' of Alf in the years after he vanished. The best of these was when a friend of my grandmother's, on holiday in Queensland, claimed to have seen him in a restaurant, with a woman and two young children. This story had a curious romance; we liked the idea of Uncle Alf ending up as a family man in sunny Australia, rather than as a corpse at the bottom of a pond or sleeping rough on the streets of London. It somehow fitted with his image as a wanderer. </p> <p>I never met Uncle Alf - he disappeared long before I was born - and yet, in a curious sense, I feel close to him, feel I understand what made him run. For who, at some time, hasn't been preoccupied with dreams of leaving? Who hasn't longed to escape the tyranny of the self, the same self we're condemned to be. If only I could start again, we say, it might be different. But even if we started again, as Aikman may well have done, there is little guarantee that we would ever get what we wanted. </p> <p>'Fairy tales and legends,' wrote Kierkegaard, 'often tell of a knight who suddenly catches sight of a rare bird of which he then sets off in pursuit, since in the beginning it seemed quite close, but then it flies off again until at last night falls. The knight is separated from his companions and lost in the wilderness in which he now finds himself.' </p> <p>Is there a more compelling narrative archetype than the quest? From the Odyssey to many of the Biblical parables to The Divine Comedy to The Faerie Queen to Paul Auster's New York Trilogy, writers have been drawn again and again to the metaphor of life as one long, extended quest for an elu sive truth or meaning. The idea that true happiness is not of this world, that our lives are no more than a transient prelude to something purer and more permanent, is central to the quest, to the idea that a search for a missing person mimics, on a local level, the more generally universal search for a hidden God, the father who never shows Himself, or ever appears in our lives. </p> <p>Georges Simenon, in his novel, Monsieur Monde Vanishes, writes well about this subject, in the parable of a wealthy man who decides to disappear from his life of ordered, affluent routine, leaving behind his wife and family in Paris. Without warning, he takes a train to Marseilles and strives to live intensely, on the margins of society - in nightclubs, underground bars and small hotels. For the first time in his adult life, he feels a liberation, stripped, as he is, of all responsibility. </p> <p>But then, one evening, he sees his wife in a hotel. She seems wan and broken; she has become a morphine addict. Monde is moved by her plight and reveals himself to her. They return to Paris, Monde having become a man 'who had laid all ghosts, who had lost all shadows, and who looked you in the eyes with cold serenity'. </p> <p> Monsieur Monde Vanishes is written from the perspective of the troubled hero. Which is a shame because what interests me as a writer is less the psychological trauma of the departed than the effect wilful disappearance has on those left behind, on Uncle Alf's baffled family, on the grieving wife and children of Michael Aikman. </p> <p>When I was researching my first novel, Unknown Pleasures, which is about a young man's obsessive search for the truth about his father who disappears without warning, I spoke to a Reverend Roger Taylor, whose father went missing when he was a baby in the 1920s. Harry Bertram Taylor was a struggling salesman from Wigan who, in Roger's resonant phrase, 'went wrong'. 'He couldn't handle money,' he adds, by way of explanation. </p> <p>In 1922, Taylor senior, after the breakdown of his marriage, sailed to New York, from where the family received occasional letters. 'But these tailed off and my mother eventually had him legally presumed dead in 1926, in order to qualify for a widow's pension.' So that was that, Taylor thought, until, in early middle age, he became increasingly oppressed by the presence of his father's always-absence, by something mysteriously incomplete and unexplained in his life. So began his search for Taylor which, in turn, became a more general search for the secrets of himself and his own identity. </p> <p>Taylor travelled to New York, constructing a narrative of his father's American adventure: that from 1922 to 1926, he'd sung in a church choir in Manhattan, after which he'd joined the chorus of Frederic Austin's revival of The Beggar's Opera. </p> <p>When the tour ended in 1928, Harry Taylor found temporary work in Ontario, where his sister lived. 'But in 1929, he went wrong again with the firm that had given him a job,' his son says. 'Money was always my father's great weakness. Fortuitously for him, about now, the opera company came together again and played in Toronto. They re-engaged my father, who now changed his name to Thomas. When investigators came looking for him, he was concealed and spirited over the border. There the trail goes cold.' </p> <p>Not a day passes but Taylor, who is in his seventies, thinks about his father and wonders what became of him. He understands that searching for a missing person, particularly one so lost to the past, is like committing yourself to the following of a grail, a grail which offers no possibility of resolution but merely lies before you like a long, flat road winding endlessly through open countryside to nowhere in particular. </p> <p>'It's the endless not knowing that troubles you most,' he says. 'Did he die during the Depression? How did he originally get into America? What happened to him once he changed his name and assumed a new identity?' </p> <p>The searcher, he knows, can never stop posing questions. What is it like being condemned to live without a sense of an ending? Well, the problem for Taylor, as for Ruth Aikman, is the lack of resolution in his own and in his father's life. A disappearance, unlike a death, frustrates, fascinates and tantalises precisely because of its lack of closure. The missing person becomes a creation of memory and imagination, both outside time and time's victim. There is never a chance definitively to mourn; everything and nothing might have happened to that absent person. He or she might be dead or alive; rich or poor; fulfilled or regretful. </p> <p>It is the person left behind who suffers most, who grapples with feelings of incompleteness, inadequacy, with Ruth Aikman's deep perplexity of 'not knowing'. But, as she says, when there is no body there is 'always hope', even if, as in her case, as in the cases of so many of the disappeared, the cruel passing of time may render any hope forlorn. </p> <p>\u0095 The National Missing Persons Bureau can be contacted on freephone 0500 700 700. </p> <p>Jason Cowley's novel, Unknown Pleasures, is published by Faber &amp; Faber (\u00a39.99) on 19 June.

'What drives people?' I heard my mother say. 'What makes them claim to be someone they're not?' It's a good question and one to which the case of Karl Hackett-Simm perhaps provides a partial answer. There were many 'sightings' of Alf in the years after he vanished. The best of these was when a friend of my grandmother's, on holiday in Queensland, claimed to have seen him in a restaurant, with a woman and two young children. This story had a curious romance; we liked the idea of Uncle Alf ending up as a family man in sunny Australia, rather than as a corpse at the bottom of a pond or sleeping rough on the streets of London. It somehow fitted with his image as a wanderer. I never met Uncle Alf - he disappeared long before I was born - and yet, in a curious sense, I feel close to him, feel I understand what made him run. For who, at some time, hasn't been preoccupied with dreams of leaving? Who hasn't longed to escape the tyranny of the self, the same self we're condemned to be. If only I could start again, we say, it might be different. But even if we started again, as Aikman may well have done, there is little guarantee that we would ever get what we wanted. 'Fairy tales and legends,' wrote Kierkegaard, 'often tell of a knight who suddenly catches sight of a rare bird of which he then sets off in pursuit, since in the beginning it seemed quite close, but then it flies off again until at last night falls. The knight is separated from his companions and lost in the wilderness in which he now finds himself.' Is there a more compelling narrative archetype than the quest? From the Odyssey to many of the Biblical parables to The Divine Comedy to The Faerie Queen to Paul Auster's New York Trilogy, writers have been drawn again and again to the metaphor of life as one long, extended quest for an elu sive truth or meaning. The idea that true happiness is not of this world, that our lives are no more than a transient prelude to something purer and more permanent, is central to the quest, to the idea that a search for a missing person mimics, on a local level, the more generally universal search for a hidden God, the father who never shows Himself, or ever appears in our lives. Georges Simenon, in his novel, Monsieur Monde Vanishes, writes well about this subject, in the parable of a wealthy man who decides to disappear from his life of ordered, affluent routine, leaving behind his wife and family in Paris. Without warning, he takes a train to Marseilles and strives to live intensely, on the margins of society - in nightclubs, underground bars and small hotels. For the first time in his adult life, he feels a liberation, stripped, as he is, of all responsibility. But then, one evening, he sees his wife in a hotel. She seems wan and broken; she has become a morphine addict. Monde is moved by her plight and reveals himself to her. They return to Paris, Monde having become a man 'who had laid all ghosts, who had lost all shadows, and who looked you in the eyes with cold serenity'. Monsieur Monde Vanishes is written from the perspective of the troubled hero. Which is a shame because what interests me as a writer is less the psychological trauma of the departed than the effect wilful disappearance has on those left behind, on Uncle Alf's baffled family, on the grieving wife and children of Michael Aikman. When I was researching my first novel, Unknown Pleasures, which is about a young man's obsessive search for the truth about his father who disappears without warning, I spoke to a Reverend Roger Taylor, whose father went missing when he was a baby in the 1920s. Harry Bertram Taylor was a struggling salesman from Wigan who, in Roger's resonant phrase, 'went wrong'. 'He couldn't handle money,' he adds, by way of explanation. In 1922, Taylor senior, after the breakdown of his marriage, sailed to New York, from where the family received occasional letters. 'But these tailed off and my mother eventually had him legally presumed dead in 1926, in order to qualify for a widow's pension.' So that was that, Taylor thought, until, in early middle age, he became increasingly oppressed by the presence of his father's always-absence, by something mysteriously incomplete and unexplained in his life. So began his search for Taylor which, in turn, became a more general search for the secrets of himself and his own identity. Taylor travelled to New York, constructing a narrative of his father's American adventure: that from 1922 to 1926, he'd sung in a church choir in Manhattan, after which he'd joined the chorus of Frederic Austin's revival of The Beggar's Opera. When the tour ended in 1928, Harry Taylor found temporary work in Ontario, where his sister lived. 'But in 1929, he went wrong again with the firm that had given him a job,' his son says. 'Money was always my father's great weakness. Fortuitously for him, about now, the opera company came together again and played in Toronto. They re-engaged my father, who now changed his name to Thomas. When investigators came looking for him, he was concealed and spirited over the border. There the trail goes cold.' Not a day passes but Taylor, who is in his seventies, thinks about his father and wonders what became of him. He understands that searching for a missing person, particularly one so lost to the past, is like committing yourself to the following of a grail, a grail which offers no possibility of resolution but merely lies before you like a long, flat road winding endlessly through open countryside to nowhere in particular. 'It's the endless not knowing that troubles you most,' he says. 'Did he die during the Depression? How did he originally get into America? What happened to him once he changed his name and assumed a new identity?' The searcher, he knows, can never stop posing questions. What is it like being condemned to live without a sense of an ending? Well, the problem for Taylor, as for Ruth Aikman, is the lack of resolution in his own and in his father's life. A disappearance, unlike a death, frustrates, fascinates and tantalises precisely because of its lack of closure. The missing person becomes a creation of memory and imagination, both outside time and time's victim. There is never a chance definitively to mourn; everything and nothing might have happened to that absent person. He or she might be dead or alive; rich or poor; fulfilled or regretful. It is the person left behind who suffers most, who grapples with feelings of incompleteness, inadequacy, with Ruth Aikman's deep perplexity of 'not knowing'. But, as she says, when there is no body there is 'always hope', even if, as in her case, as in the cases of so many of the disappeared, the cruel passing of time may render any hope forlorn. \u0095 The National Missing Persons Bureau can be contacted on freephone 0500 700 700.

      "body": "<p>I had mixed feelings about summer as a child: on the one hand, I loved the sunny days, but on the other I felt for a friend, who found wearing summer clothes agonising. Like thousands of other youngsters, she'd suffered from eczema virtually from birth, and not only were her limbs badly scarred with rough, red vesicles, but the presence of pollen in the atmosphere irritated her condition even more. One of the main problems with eczema is that the irritation that it inflicts makes sufferers scratch, thereby breaking the skin's surface and causing it to bleed and weep, and perhaps also to become infected. Although we tried to keep her scratching down to a minimum by helping to wrap her in soft cotton bandages, eczema nevertheless made her childhood summers insufferable. I wish we'd known then what I know now, however; there is a lot we could have done to relieve some of her discomfort.</p> <p>Eczema is often caused by the body's intolerance of - or oversensitivity or allergic reaction to - certain foods, the most common being cow's milk and eggs. If your child suffers from eczema, it is therefore worth avoiding these foods for a couple of weeks to see whether the symptoms improve. In the case of cow's milk, exclude all of its forms and sources, including yogurt, cream, butter, skimmed-milk powder and foods containing lactose, casein and whey (you'll need to check food labels carefully). You should also avoid all egg derivatives, such as lecithin or ovalbumin (and remember that pasta and cakes can contain these ingredients).</p> <p>Since a few children have an adverse reaction to lactose (the sugar that is contained in mammalian milks), it's best to avoid all forms of milk, including goat's or sheep's milk, during the food trial. It may be that non-bovine dairy products can be safely included in the diet later, but I recommend that you seek advice from a dietician first. If you ascertain that your child has a milk sensitivity, there shouldn't be any long-term nutritional implications if they take an alternative source of calcium.</p> <p>Another common irritant is chicken, which is relatively easy to avoid. A more difficult challenge, however, is presented by azo dyes, including tartrazine, sunset yellow and amaranth, which are labelled with E numbers ranging from 100 to 180. These colourings are used in such manufactured foods as fruit juices, sweets, biscuits and ice cream. I recommend that you exclude all processed foods from your child's diet, including some that may be labelled 'natural', 'wholesome' or 'nutritious' - all of which are unregulated descriptions. Although excluding all processed foods from your child's diet may become a nightmare in practical terms (and you will need to tell their school and friends' parents that they shouldn't be given processed foods), it is worth persevering with.</p> <p>As with the majority of adverse food reactions, quantity plays a significant role. Some children can eat a small amount of a dairy product or the odd, additive-containing snack without their eczema being triggered. If this is the case, treating them to such a food once a week may make life more manageable and enjoyable for everyone, without aggravating their skin condition. The systems of some of the children I treat, however, are so sensitive that one mouthful of the trigger food causes their skin to erupt. In addition, a stressed gut is more likely to absorb a greater amount of the allergen, so if your child is upset, make sure that they stick to 'safe' foods.</p> <p>If, having followed the trigger-food avoidance diet, nothing changes in the condition of certain children, I initiate an exclusion, or 'few-food' diet for a couple of weeks. This involves restricting their diet to a handful of what are generally regarded as the least allergenic foods, such as turkey, cabbage, potatoes, bananas, tap water, and little else. This is an extremely hard regime to follow (although we increase the range of foods once we've calmed the skin down) and should only be conducted under the guidance of a paediatric dietician. Yet such stringent efforts can reap appreciable rewards. One little boy came to me covered in oozing, raw vesicles; just three weeks into the few-food diet, it took a close look to see the patches of rough skin.

      "bodyText": "I had mixed feelings about summer as a child: on the one hand, I loved the sunny days, but on the other I felt for a friend, who found wearing summer clothes agonising. Like thousands of other youngsters, she'd suffered from eczema virtually from birth, and not only were her limbs badly scarred with rough, red vesicles, but the presence of pollen in the atmosphere irritated her condition even more. One of the main problems with eczema is that the irritation that it inflicts makes sufferers scratch, thereby breaking the skin's surface and causing it to bleed and weep, and perhaps also to become infected. Although we tried to keep her scratching down to a minimum by helping to wrap her in soft cotton bandages, eczema nevertheless made her childhood summers insufferable. I wish we'd known then what I know now, however; there is a lot we could have done to relieve some of her discomfort. Eczema is often caused by the body's intolerance of - or oversensitivity or allergic reaction to - certain foods, the most common being cow's milk and eggs. If your child suffers from eczema, it is therefore worth avoiding these foods for a couple of weeks to see whether the symptoms improve. In the case of cow's milk, exclude all of its forms and sources, including yogurt, cream, butter, skimmed-milk powder and foods containing lactose, casein and whey (you'll need to check food labels carefully). You should also avoid all egg derivatives, such as lecithin or ovalbumin (and remember that pasta and cakes can contain these ingredients). Since a few children have an adverse reaction to lactose (the sugar that is contained in mammalian milks), it's best to avoid all forms of milk, including goat's or sheep's milk, during the food trial. It may be that non-bovine dairy products can be safely included in the diet later, but I recommend that you seek advice from a dietician first. If you ascertain that your child has a milk sensitivity, there shouldn't be any long-term nutritional implications if they take an alternative source of calcium. Another common irritant is chicken, which is relatively easy to avoid. A more difficult challenge, however, is presented by azo dyes, including tartrazine, sunset yellow and amaranth, which are labelled with E numbers ranging from 100 to 180. These colourings are used in such manufactured foods as fruit juices, sweets, biscuits and ice cream. I recommend that you exclude all processed foods from your child's diet, including some that may be labelled 'natural', 'wholesome' or 'nutritious' - all of which are unregulated descriptions. Although excluding all processed foods from your child's diet may become a nightmare in practical terms (and you will need to tell their school and friends' parents that they shouldn't be given processed foods), it is worth persevering with. As with the majority of adverse food reactions, quantity plays a significant role. Some children can eat a small amount of a dairy product or the odd, additive-containing snack without their eczema being triggered. If this is the case, treating them to such a food once a week may make life more manageable and enjoyable for everyone, without aggravating their skin condition. The systems of some of the children I treat, however, are so sensitive that one mouthful of the trigger food causes their skin to erupt. In addition, a stressed gut is more likely to absorb a greater amount of the allergen, so if your child is upset, make sure that they stick to 'safe' foods. If, having followed the trigger-food avoidance diet, nothing changes in the condition of certain children, I initiate an exclusion, or 'few-food' diet for a couple of weeks. This involves restricting their diet to a handful of what are generally regarded as the least allergenic foods, such as turkey, cabbage, potatoes, bananas, tap water, and little else. This is an extremely hard regime to follow (although we increase the range of foods once we've calmed the skin down) and should only be conducted under the guidance of a paediatric dietician. Yet such stringent efforts can reap appreciable rewards. One little boy came to me covered in oozing, raw vesicles; just three weeks into the few-food diet, it took a close look to see the patches of rough skin. He now sleeps much better, too, which means that everyone in the family is happier. Another nutritional strategy that I've successfully tried with older children is encouraging them to eat oily fish, such as mackerel, tuna, pilchards and salmon. These fish contain omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids, which alter the body's biochemistry, in particular changing the inflammatory reaction that aggravates eczema. If you give them a portion of oily fish a day when their skin is at its worst (three times a week represents a good all-round skin-food dose during less critical periods), it is likely that they will experience substantial relief. If the omega fatty acids are to be effective, the child's intake of saturated animal fats - such as butter and cream - should be kept to a minimum.

      "body": "<p>Matthew is just like any other teenager. He likes drinking with his mates, messing about on his computer and going out with his girlfriend. He is the typical adolescent bundle of contradictions: one minute cocksure, defiant and mature beyond his years, the next vulnerable, desperate to conform and childishly naive. But on top of the emotional roller coaster faced by any 17-year-old, Matthew - not his real name - is growing up with a secret that haunts him every day. He is HIV positive.</p> <p>Matthew was born with HIV, transmitted from his mother, who, along with his brother, died of Aids when Matthew was small. Nobody expected Matthew to survive long, either. But his fighting spirit - and new drugs developed in the last few years to keep the virus in check - has helped him confound the medics. Now he is possibly the longest-surviving youngster born with HIV in the UK.</p> <p>It is not a position he wants to shout about. 'If you have HIV, you just want to live your life as normal,' he says. 'I would like to be able to go out there and just live my life without a secret.' But the stigma of HIV makes that impossible.</p> <p>Many other youngsters live with the same secret. Children who were never expected to become teenagers are now presenting health professionals with dilemmas they thought they would never face. About 600 children have been born with HIV in the UK since the early 80s, and nearly 450 survive today, according to the Public Health Laboratory Service. Most, but not all, were born to parents of African origin. The statistics show that 69 youngsters have reached their teens, although some have been lost to official records.</p> <p>Many people will remember the emotive pictures of Princess Diana in the 80s holding tiny babies with Aids. Now that some of those youngsters are reaching adolescence, the 'sympathy vote', as one HIV expert puts it, has evaporated. Most lead double lives, unable to reveal their diagnosis to friends, teachers or families.</p> <p>Matthew has known he was HIV positive since he was four. He was told by social workers after his mother died, and was placed with foster parents. Both his mother and father - whom he does not see - came from Africa. Outwardly, he looks like any other healthy youngster. So far, the virus has never made him ill, although he must take care to avoid infections that could turn serious, and he is on almost permanent medication. Yet from early on, Matthew learned to keep quiet about his diagnosis.</p> <p>'When I was young, I understood it had to be a secret. My mother [his foster mother] made this clear as I was growing up,' he says. All through school, he could not tell classmates. Now at sixth-form college, only his best friend and - since December - his girlfriend, know. 'I would love to walk out there with a big banner and say, \"I am HIV positive,\" and for people to just walk on by,' Matthew says. He feels he cannot 'because for many people, HIV means death. You have HIV, you will die. You have HIV, you are dirty. These are the common themes.'</p> <p>The only place Matthew can talk openly is at the London youth group Teen Spirit, a weekly club for children with HIV and those whose parents are HIV positive. Run by the charity Body and Soul, next door to the Great Ormond Street Hospital, where Matthew attends the family HIV clinic, it opened three years ago and offers the only meeting space in the UK for teenagers to talk about their HIV status. About 40 youngsters attend each week to make friends, play music, eat and chat. Others keep in touch by telephone and email.</p> <p>Behind Teen Spirit's doors, Matthew is a role model for others struggling through adolescence with HIV. He can unburden himself. Outside, he's terrified of being found out. It took him months to tell his girlfriend. 'I had to think about the consequences,' he explains. 'If she was to tell her mum or other people, then I would have to move away.' Luckily, she has stood by him. It is his first serious relationship and, again leading the way for other teenagers, Matthew is having to grapple with the deadly serious business of safe sex. Teen Spirit members are well versed in the dangers of passing on HIV through unprotected sex. 'I know my responsibilities,' says Matthew. 'I would not take risks. I wouldn't be able to live with myself.'</p> <p>Matthew wants to go to university, become an interior designer and eventually have children, although he knows he may have to adopt, rather than risk passing on HIV. It is quite possible, according to HIV experts, that Matthew may realise his ambitions. There is no reason why he should not live into his twenties and perhaps beyond, says Margaret Clapson, HIV clinical nurse specialist at the clinic Matthew attends. She helps treat 125 children, aged from two months to 17 years. Nearly 40 are over 10 years old and some - like Matthew - are into their teens. But this success brings with it a host of new difficulties for hospital staff.</p> <p>Children born with HIV are surviving longer than doctors expected because of the development in 1996 of combination therapy, which blends several drugs into a powerful cocktail to repress the virus. The drugs regime is rigid and may mean taking 15 tablets daily at set times. Lapses mean the virus can become resistant to those drugs and so a new combination has to be tried. Persuading teenagers to stick to such routines is a major headache.</p> <p>'This is a problem that, five years ago, we didn't think we would have,' says Clapson. 'We didn't think these children would live past 15.' Many teenagers are loath to take medicines they have to hide or that interfere with their social lives, she says. One 15-year-old is refusing medication despite having nearly died. For Matthew, who has also let his regime lapse, the next combination will be the last. If that fails, he is reliant on scientists developing new medicines. Other teenagers have not even been told they are HIV positive. They may be told they have to take medicines to stay well, but their parents feel unable to tell them their diagnosis, despite staff's efforts to persuade them. At 16, staff will do it anyway because, under the Children Act, they have a right to know.</p> <p>'I think it is wrong for any 16-year-old not to know,' says Clapson. As well as explaining the importance of taking medication, they may well be sexually active, she explains. She recently had to tell one 16-year-old boy who - like some others - had already guessed. The clinic offers counselling to help youngsters cope with their diagnosis, and also with bereavement. Many have lost families to Aids or are helping to care for sick parents.</p> <p>Still, for many teenagers, one of the worst aspects of HIV is the stigma. Matthew and other teenagers attending Great Ormond Street Hospital have refused to transfer to adult care. Rightly or wrongly, at 17 they do not want to attend a clinic along with openly gay men, drug abusers and prostitutes, says Clapson. So far, adult services have agreed to come to them.</p> <p>At St Mary's Hospital, west London, doctors and nurses are treating about 120 HIV-positive children, including 15 teenagers. Consultant paediatrician Dr Gareth Tudor-Williams fully expects the number of teenagers to grow. 'Any of the children who have survived the first 10 years are very likely to survive the next 10,' he says. 'With the right treatment, many of these kids will survive into their twenties.'</p> <p>Ensuring teenagers stick to treatment is a big problem. 'It is a struggle to persuade teenagers that they are not invincible and that they must carry on with the medicines,' he says. Hospital staff try to organise drug regimes so that youngsters do not have to take tablets during school, when they would have to explain them to classmates, and negotiate with schools to explain a child's long absences. For these teenagers, too, HIV carries a powerful stigma.</p> <p>But one young person is determined to break down the HIV taboo. Clint Walters contracted HIV when he was 17, in just his second gay relationship. Appalled at the lack of help for young people, last year he decided to launch Health Initiatives for Youth UK - based on similar groups in the US - to provide support for other HIV-positive youngsters, aged 15 to 27. Now 20, he spends much of his time visiting schools to talk openly about having HIV in the hope that other teenagers may learn from his mistake. 'There are a lot of young people out there who are not educated and not aware, and they are finding themselves in the same position I was in,' he says.</p> <p>Discussion of HIV during sex education in schools is minimal, he says, and teachers are often scared to talk explicitly about safe sex. He fears ignorance is fuelling increased infection. 'I was 17. I never knew anyone with HIV. I never knew anything about it,' he says. Now he wants to stand up and be counted. 'Yes, I am positive. I am not ashamed of it.'</p> <p><b>HIV: the facts</b></p> <p>* Many people now think that HIV is no longer a problem in the UK, yet the virus is as much a threat as ever. Last year saw the highest number of new infections for a decade - 2,457 diagnoses - and for the first time most were through heterosexual contact. Public health experts are concerned that ignorance and complacency could soon unleash an explosion in HIV infection.</p> <p>* More than 40,000 people have been infected with HIV in the UK since first reports in the 1980s. Of these, 41 per cent have developed Aids and nearly a quarter have died.</p> <p>* Up to this year, 614 children have been born with HIV and 441 survive. A total of 69 are now believed to be teenagers.</p> <p>* All pregnant women are now offered antenatal testing for HIV. If the test is positive, taking anti-viral medication can reduce the chance of passing HIV to the baby. Avoiding breast-feeding reduces risk further.</p> <p>* Combination therapy is delaying the onset of AIDS. Many people with HIV are living healthy lives.</p> <p>* Recent studies show that risky sexual behaviour is increasing, particularly among gay men. There have been huge increases in such STDs as gonorrhoea - cases rose by 26 to 30 per cent last year, especially among the young. These figures, along with the highest teenage-pregnancy rate in Europe, suggest that the safe-sex message is not getting through.</p> <p><b> Contacts</b></p> <p><b>Teen Spirit at Body and Soul</b> produces leaflets and a video, The Spirit of Youth (\u00a316.50) on HIV.

Teen Spirit members are well versed in the dangers of passing on HIV through unprotected sex. 'I know my responsibilities,' says Matthew. 'I would not take risks. I wouldn't be able to live with myself.' Matthew wants to go to university, become an interior designer and eventually have children, although he knows he may have to adopt, rather than risk passing on HIV. It is quite possible, according to HIV experts, that Matthew may realise his ambitions. There is no reason why he should not live into his twenties and perhaps beyond, says Margaret Clapson, HIV clinical nurse specialist at the clinic Matthew attends. She helps treat 125 children, aged from two months to 17 years. Nearly 40 are over 10 years old and some - like Matthew - are into their teens. But this success brings with it a host of new difficulties for hospital staff. Children born with HIV are surviving longer than doctors expected because of the development in 1996 of combination therapy, which blends several drugs into a powerful cocktail to repress the virus. The drugs regime is rigid and may mean taking 15 tablets daily at set times. Lapses mean the virus can become resistant to those drugs and so a new combination has to be tried. Persuading teenagers to stick to such routines is a major headache. 'This is a problem that, five years ago, we didn't think we would have,' says Clapson. 'We didn't think these children would live past 15.' Many teenagers are loath to take medicines they have to hide or that interfere with their social lives, she says. One 15-year-old is refusing medication despite having nearly died. For Matthew, who has also let his regime lapse, the next combination will be the last. If that fails, he is reliant on scientists developing new medicines. Other teenagers have not even been told they are HIV positive. They may be told they have to take medicines to stay well, but their parents feel unable to tell them their diagnosis, despite staff's efforts to persuade them. At 16, staff will do it anyway because, under the Children Act, they have a right to know. 'I think it is wrong for any 16-year-old not to know,' says Clapson. As well as explaining the importance of taking medication, they may well be sexually active, she explains. She recently had to tell one 16-year-old boy who - like some others - had already guessed. The clinic offers counselling to help youngsters cope with their diagnosis, and also with bereavement. Many have lost families to Aids or are helping to care for sick parents. Still, for many teenagers, one of the worst aspects of HIV is the stigma. Matthew and other teenagers attending Great Ormond Street Hospital have refused to transfer to adult care. Rightly or wrongly, at 17 they do not want to attend a clinic along with openly gay men, drug abusers and prostitutes, says Clapson. So far, adult services have agreed to come to them. At St Mary's Hospital, west London, doctors and nurses are treating about 120 HIV-positive children, including 15 teenagers. Consultant paediatrician Dr Gareth Tudor-Williams fully expects the number of teenagers to grow. 'Any of the children who have survived the first 10 years are very likely to survive the next 10,' he says. 'With the right treatment, many of these kids will survive into their twenties.' Ensuring teenagers stick to treatment is a big problem. 'It is a struggle to persuade teenagers that they are not invincible and that they must carry on with the medicines,' he says. Hospital staff try to organise drug regimes so that youngsters do not have to take tablets during school, when they would have to explain them to classmates, and negotiate with schools to explain a child's long absences. For these teenagers, too, HIV carries a powerful stigma. But one young person is determined to break down the HIV taboo. Clint Walters contracted HIV when he was 17, in just his second gay relationship. Appalled at the lack of help for young people, last year he decided to launch Health Initiatives for Youth UK - based on similar groups in the US - to provide support for other HIV-positive youngsters, aged 15 to 27. Now 20, he spends much of his time visiting schools to talk openly about having HIV in the hope that other teenagers may learn from his mistake. 'There are a lot of young people out there who are not educated and not aware, and they are finding themselves in the same position I was in,' he says. Discussion of HIV during sex education in schools is minimal, he says, and teachers are often scared to talk explicitly about safe sex. He fears ignorance is fuelling increased infection. 'I was 17. I never knew anyone with HIV. I never knew anything about it,' he says. Now he wants to stand up and be counted. 'Yes, I am positive. I am not ashamed of it.' HIV: the facts * Many people now think that HIV is no longer a problem in the UK, yet the virus is as much a threat as ever. Last year saw the highest number of new infections for a decade - 2,457 diagnoses - and for the first time most were through heterosexual contact. Public health experts are concerned that ignorance and complacency could soon unleash an explosion in HIV infection. * More than 40,000 people have been infected with HIV in the UK since first reports in the 1980s. Of these, 41 per cent have developed Aids and nearly a quarter have died. * Up to this year, 614 children have been born with HIV and 441 survive. A total of 69 are now believed to be teenagers. * All pregnant women are now offered antenatal testing for HIV. If the test is positive, taking anti-viral medication can reduce the chance of passing HIV to the baby. Avoiding breast-feeding reduces risk further. * Combination therapy is delaying the onset of AIDS. Many people with HIV are living healthy lives. * Recent studies show that risky sexual behaviour is increasing, particularly among gay men. There have been huge increases in such STDs as gonorrhoea - cases rose by 26 to 30 per cent last year, especially among the young. These figures, along with the highest teenage-pregnancy rate in Europe, suggest that the safe-sex message is not getting through.

And despite 200 witnesses, a two-year investigation and a \u00a321,000 reward, the police seem no nearer to catching his killer.

      "byline": "Andrew Anthony",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the school photograph that was never taken, Ronald Hinkson does not stand out as a potential murder victim. Even allowing that there is no physiognomical protection against random violence, Ronald's good-naturedly mischievous expression was nothing if not disarming. He always looked somehow as if he got the joke and was prepared to share it with you. </p> <p>Group photographs from childhood contain a curiously magical quality. The viewer is instinctively drawn to look for clues in the subjects' faces, as if the secret of fate is hidden in their half-formed features. The school Ronald and I attended was too poorly organised to arrange a massed sitting for the camera, so all that is left to be studied are snapshots from evanescent memory. </p> <p>Among the school's 1,200 or so kids, I now know, was a senior government policy adviser, at least one murderer, an MP, an armed robber, numerous small-time crooks, and hundreds of blamelessly invisible members of society. Most, as far as I'm concerned, have disappeared, erased from recollection; a small minority are vague outlines, an assemblage of odd details and indistinct flashbacks; then there are 20 or 30 who remain vividly present. </p> <p>Ronald is part of the latter group, although he was a couple of years below me, which normally means below the radar of recall. A large boy, who grew up to be an imposingly large man, he had a sly grin and a casual stroll - what we used to call a 'bowl' - that were enough to set him apart. </p> <p>He lived a couple of streets from me, went to the same primary and secondary schools, and had a brother in my tutor group. I often saw Ronald around the neighbourhood and we'd usually exchange a smile or an acknowledgment, but we were never friends, just as we were never enemies. For some reason, which I never thought about, I liked him. And I was not alone. Over 1,000 people packed into a small church in Gospel Oak, north London, for his memorial service. </p> <p>When I read that he'd been killed, I felt a muted kind of sadness. I thought about his family and their loss, but I suppose I thought not unselfishly about myself, about the unseen proximity of death and the tragedy of meeting it in your thirties. And I thought about the aching smallness of it all. Ronald was murdered half a mile from his home, and less than a mile from our old school. He was in a bar on a night out with his friends. </p> <p>That was back in September 1997. I didn't follow the story very closely. After the initial shock, I stored the glumness away in a mental file that was beginning to overflow with bad news from my childhood neighbourhood: murders, drug wars, imprisoned friends, a cousin who'd become a junkie and petty criminal, another who'd committed suicide, stabbings, beatings and muggings - contemporary street life. All of this in the semi-gentrified area of Kentish Town. </p> <p>While I didn't exactly forget about Ron, I let him become another grim anecdote to share with people I'd run into from my teenage days. Then, just before Christmas, I was driving through Kentish Town when I saw a huge poster draped over a railway bridge. Emblazoned on it was an image of Ronald, not the amused kid in the imaginary school photo, but a grown man, a father it turned out, a pensive adult with plans and responsibilities. The message read: </p> <p>You know who killed Ronald Hinkson </p> <p>You know where his killer is </p> <p>You saw or heard what happened </p> <p>You could secure justice for Ron's family </p> <p>Underneath there was a Crimestoppers number to call and a police inquiry line. The message also included an offer of a reward of \u00a321,000. The wording was disturbing, more like an accusation aimed at unnamed locals than a communal appeal for information. The whole effect was immediately striking, not least because it made me realise that more than two years later the man responsible for Ronald's death had still not been found. How could someone be murdered in front of hundreds of witnesses and his killer get away? And why? Was he just in the wrong place at the wrong time or was the wrong of a deeper, more threatening nature? </p> <p>On the night he was slain, Ronald was taking part in a celebration that he and some of his friends had made an irregular social ritual. About once every couple of months, five or so friends would meet up for an evening to mark one of the group members' birthdays. Having become the father of a baby son, Reuben, earlier that year, Ronald seldom went out to pubs or clubs. </p> <p>He worked most nights as a graphic designer. On his last day alive, he spent the morning and afternoon laying a floor in the home he shared with his son's mother, Tracy Hill, in Camden Town. At that small flat, I visited Tracy one afternoon this spring. </p> <p>A resolute young woman with strong dark hair and a handsome face made unjustly sad, she spoke of Ronald and herself as a couple who were arriving at the good part of their lives. 'Having Reuben was the best thing that ever happened to us.' </p> <p>Photographs of Reuben decorated the walls and there was a striking shot of Ronald in sharp profile with close-shaved head, wearing a white T-shirt. 'He was terrible at DIY,' Tracy recalled. 'I usually did it all. But he was proud of the floor and my parents came to see it.' At around 5pm on 13 September 1997, Ronald and Tracy went to a neighbour's party for an hour or so until Ronald's friend Joel called by to pick him up. 'They left at about 6.30,' she remembered. Then, without pausing, she turned the everyday banality of that detail into crushing finality. 'And that was the last time I saw him.' </p> <p>Sometimes, especially after a spate of violent crime, there is a ready impression, picked up from press and TV reports, that people are murdered all the time. The reality is less dramatic and much less dangerous. Statistically, in any given year, there is a 1-in-80,000 chance of suffering a violent death. And the probability of being murdered by a stranger is significantly smaller, moving towards the 1-in-a-million mark. That figure begins to rise again, however, if you live in the inner city and you are male and black and under 35, like Ronald. But it's still negligible. In other words, neither Ronald nor Tracy had any reason to expect that evening to be his last. </p> <p>After collecting a couple of other friends, the group headed for the Vulture's Perch, a renovated pub in Kentish Town Road, the high street, that is already beginning to look ancient. The shops change and the pubs change - or at least their names do - but Kentish Town Road has remained stubbornly the same for as long as I can remember. </p> <p>There were now six friends - Joel, Gary, Richard, Nicholas, Gary and Ronald. Not that they would have been concerned with the symmetry, nor perhaps even noticed it, but three were black and three were white. Kentish Town is not immune to racism and there are pubs in which few black faces are seen. On the whole, though, it is an unaffectedly integrated area: Ronald's mix of friends was not in the least conspicuous. </p> <p>Richard had turned 30 and they were drinking champagne. By all accounts, it was a lively evening, and the group joshed with anyone who came within its orbit. When closing time arrived, they were keen to continue the celebrations. There were few options after 11pm. The choice was between the after-hours places in Little Cyprus, in Camden Town, or Barzaar, a late-night bar on Camden Road. Ronald said he knew a doorman at Barzaar. As they left the Vulture's, Ronald put a phone call in to Tracy to say he would be late. </p> <p>If the high street has stayed much the same over the years, the rest of Kentish Town has undergone huge changes. In the 70s and 80s, middle-class families moved into those parts of the neighbourhood whose Victorian housing had survived Camden Council's year-zero plan to replace terraced streets with council estates. In the 80s, and increasingly in the 90s, the drug economy replaced some of the traditional employment, such as the railways and Camden Council, which had off-loaded workers. Between 1992 and 1997, drug trafficking offences in the borough went up five-fold. It's a cycle that has been repeated in inner cities all over Britain. The only difference with Camden is that the results sit cheek-by-jowl with the equally dramatic influx of monied professionals. </p> <p>The effects have been particularly extreme in one corner of the borough, the area surrounding Queen's Crescent market, which is almost landlocked by railway lines and road-blocks. Walking with an old school friend around Queen's Crescent, where Ron and I grew up, I was surprised at the number of places he pointed out that are now drug-dealing houses. He told me about an old neighbour and schoolmate of ours who was jailed a couple of years ago for the murder of another local in what was described as a disagreement over drugs. Before the case came to trial, the main witness, who refused police protection, was also shot dead. Jesus, I thought, that's the kind of thing that happens in The Sopranos, not Kentish Town. </p> <p>'Queen's Crescent has become a no-go area,' said another former resident, some weeks later, as we drove through. A few days previously, a 58-year-old woman had been sexually assaulted in Marsden Street, in the heart of the neighbourhood. Two days later a man was found dead, one block away, on the corner of Rhyl Street - my old street - and Malden Road. At first, people were saying he'd been shot. But a post-mortem found that he had died as a result of an epileptic fit. Yet rumours as to the cause of death persisted when it emerged that the previous day he'd been set upon by a gang of youths. It seemed instructive that the first assumption locals jumped to was that the poor man had been gunned down. </p> <p>My school friend, a giant hulk of a man, and not an easily intimidated character, was anxious to remain anonymous. According to him, the main dealers were linked in various ways to a north London crime family that has gained near legendary status for its ruthlessness. The family's name has been connected with countless murders as well as a multi-million pound drug empire. </p> <p>On the surface, Queen's Crescent makes for an unconvincing no-go area. For a start, a quarter of the Crescent itself is made up of much sought-after houses that sell for around \u00a3500,000. It's about three stops on the bus from Hampstead Heath: Keats House, expensive tea shops, Michael Foot. </p> <p>But it's also a street market that, like many places of its kind, is eerily deserted come evening, except for teenagers hanging uselessly on street corners, and boozed-up blokes stumbling between pubs. On a Saturday morning it can seem like a fictional community, a multi-generational Anglo-Irish-Caribbean tribe of gossips. On a Saturday night, it's not somewhere you'd choose to walk alone. A couple of years ago a man was shot as he left an off-licence in Queen's Crescent. The gunmen said only two words before he fired: 'You're dead.' </p> <p>'Ronald knew people from Kentish Town who had got into trouble,' said Tracy. 'He didn't want to follow that path. He did things the right way. He had a real sense of justice.' </p> <p>On the map, the short distance Ronald moved from his family home in Queen's Crescent to his own place near Camden Square appears trivial. But it separated him from an inward-looking street culture that was turning nasty. His brother Michael told me that he thought Ronald, having left the Crescent, had not fully grasped the consequences of the changes that had taken place in the neighbourhood. </p> <p>'Not long before he died,' recalled Michael, 'he tried to stop a fight between two old friends. They were arguing over drugs. I told him: \"Don't get caught in the middle. Things have got serious. These people use knives.\"' </p> <p>Ron's mother, Daisy Gobay, lives two streets from the Crescent in Grafton Terrace, a wide street with neat little houses in which Karl Marx once lived. Nearly three years ago, she received a call on a Saturday night that had already turned into a Sunday morning. It was from Tracy, telling her that Ronald was in the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead. </p> <p>She went immediately, but her son had already been pronounced dead on arrival at 1.30am. Daisy's compact home is filled with photographs of Ronald. A generous-hearted woman who is easily moved to laughter, she is not a mournful character by nature. But when she talks of her son, the sense of a mother's loss is chokingly obvious. 'I know I would say this because I am his mother,' she explained, 'but he was such a nice bloke.' </p> <p>Her daughter Julie, a legal representative with a diligent manner, carefully went over the information she had gathered from the police, Ronald's friends and talk on the street. But, to her own and her mother's continuing frustration, that information is severely limited. The police have been very protective of their evidence. And for a variety of reasons, Ronald's friends have only partial stories to tell. That leaves street talk. </p> <p>That Ronald's killer is free is of course distressing, but the confusion that surrounds the murder itself is an additional emotional burden for Ronald's family, and one that is unlikely to be lifted without a trial. </p> <p>At around the time Ronald and his friends arrived at Barzaar, they were met by two other men, a couple of black friends from south London. 'This is where the big blur comes in,' Julie told me. </p> <p>When the police arrived at Barzaar, they found one man unconscious outside the bar, another dazed and regaining consciousness and a third bleeding profusely under the railway bridge less than a hundred yards away. All of them were black. More than two hundred other customers were either milling around or streaming away. The only person to be arrested at the scene was the dazed man, who, on coming to, began shouting. </p> <p>DCI John Sweeney is now in charge of the Hinkson murder inquiry. When I visited him at the murder squad's headquarters in Hendon, he played down the significance of Ronald's friend's arrest. 'It would have been for his own protection,' he explained. </p> <p>DCI Sweeney is an engaging 40-year-old. There is little trace of pedantic Scotland Yard formality in his manner. He's open, without giving anything away, and not overly defensive, although he never goes so far as to accept police failings or incompetence. </p> <p>'What I find surprising,' said Julie, 'is that when the police arrived, the 200 people on site all walked away. Then we had this pathetic appeals for witnesses to come forward the following week.' </p> <p>She says the police did not even interview Ronald's friends that night and that it was only after Daisy made one of them go along to the station the next day that the police agreed to speak to him about what he'd seen. </p> <p>'Other than the stabbing,' counters DCI Sweeney, 'the scene would have looked very much like any other Saturday-night fight when the police arrived. It's impossible to hold that many people. The first priority is preserving life, then the scene of the crime.' </p> <p>In her experience, Julie had found the police were more than capable of containing that number of people. 'I've been to black clubs and there has been trouble and the police lock you in and you have to say who you are to leave.' </p> <p>Here is the unspoken issue that has dogged, without ever quite dominating, the case: race. Ronald and the four other black men who made up his party were possibly the only black people in Barzaar that night. Two of them were badly beaten up and the the third, Ronald, was murdered. </p> <p>It was not unheard of for black people to go to the bar, but they were the exception. The image Barzaar had was of a hang-out for white toughs, men who either wanted to look the part of the well-connected hardnut - so-called plastic gangsters - or who were well-connected hardnuts, the real thing. </p> <p>'That's where the chaps went,' one local told me, meaning the 'faces', the kind of people who boasted a reputation and, not infrequently, a record. Ernest James, chair of Camden's licensing committee, described the bar as a 'safe place to be for a certain class of person' and somewhere that attracted a 'working-class racist element'. </p> <p>The first officer to lead the inquiry, chief inspector David Brown, discounted the notion of a racially motivated crime pretty much from the outset. Daisy, in particular, was disappointed by what she saw as a reluctance on the police's behalf to explore the question of race, particularly as none of the three white men in Ronald's party was injured or, indeed, attacked. </p> <p>'If they [the police] had found a blonde girl stabbed to death,' Julie suggested, 'I think they would have reacted more quickly and more effectively.' </p> <p>DCI Brown was replaced last year by DCI Sweeney. Before he left the case, his investigation was taken to task by the local newspaper, Camden New Journal, which voiced some of Daisy's complaints. As tensions grew between the Hinksons and the police, the findings of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry were making headlines. The Metropolitan Police were held responsible for 'institutional racism' - a charge which the botched initial investigation of the murder of Michael Menson, the black musician who was set alight by a gang, served only to underline. Brown sued the newspaper, which settled out of court. </p> <p>At the time the Journal ran its piece, the case papers had been sent for review to Assistant Commissioner John Grieve, the head of the Racial and Violent Crimes Task Force. It was Grieve's men who relabelled Menson's 'suicide' a homicide and went on to bring his killers to justice. </p> <p>DCI Sweeney says that Grieve has maintained a watching brief on Ronald's murder, and has been on hand for advice if needed, but that essentially the crime is not being treated as racial, although, he adds, the police are sensitive to any issues connected to race. Grieve helped launch a new appeal for evidence in the case when he unveiled the railway bridge poster to the press. </p> <p>Relations between the Hinksons and the police have improved since Sweeney's appointment. One of the recommendations of the Lawrence inquiry that has since become standard practice was the assignment of a family liaison officer. DC Curtis visits Daisy and Julie once a week, as well as seeing Tracy Hill. For Tracy, being able to talk to someone has made a difference. 'The liaison officer is fantastic,' she told me. </p> <p>Daisy and Julie are also appreciative but impatient at what they see as the slow progress of the inquiry. 'He [the liaison officer] tells us what he can but he can't tell us anything,' Julie said. 'But he tries. There is access now.' </p> <p>Daisy has begun to worry that no one will be arrested for Ronald's murder. Yet DCI Sweeney remains confident that, as with most murders, this one will be solved and the police will get their man. But who killed Ronald and why? And where is he now? </p> <p>Once inside Barzaar, Ronald and his friends continued the party. It was the first time Ron had ever been to the bar, despite living nearby. His brother felt that it was not the kind of place a black man should have gone unless he was certain of what to expect. But the atmosphere was heady and Ronald was in high spirits. As his sister put it to me: 'Apart from the murder, it was a good night.' </p> <p>At a point just after 12.30am, an argument started. Accounts differ as to its origin because some of Ronald's friends say they were in the lavatory or were out of ear shot. But none would speak to me. </p> <p>From witness statements, DCI Sweeney was able to tell me that a dispute apparently arose between one of Ronald's party and a man who may or may not have been working at the bar. It seems that Ronald's friend might have been smoking a joint. 'Ronald doesn't take drugs,' said his brother, using the present tense of bereavement. </p> <p>'My son's a big fella,' Daisy said. 'I've got a feeling one of his friends was getting mistreated and he stepped in.' </p> <p>According to some testaments, Ronald intervened as a mediator, attempting to calm the situation. The man then said something to Ronald and thrust a glass in his face. Whatever happened next was viciously quick and hauntingly beyond reason. Ronald and two of his friends were pushed outside and followed by a large gang of men. The two friends were knocked out. They think they were attacked with baseball bats. Ronald was stabbed 10 times. Two of the wounds - in the neck and the heart - were fatal. </p> <p>No one reported hearing any racial slurs or insults and thus the police informed Daisy early on in the investigation that they did not think racism came into play. 'But how can you stab someone 10 times without hatred?' she asked me. Standing 6ft 2in and weighing nearly 20 stone, Ronald was indeed a big man. More than that, he was a big black man, and in our society that makes many people nervous. Ronald himself knew how he could be wrongly perceived. </p> <p>'Ron was aware that people would judge him on sight,' said Tracy, who is white. 'But he never accepted that. He would mix with anyone and, because of that, he rarely came up against racism.' </p> <p>What Ronald came up against that night may not have been racism, but it was, as his mother rightly said, a demonstration of hatred. His life bleeding away, Ronald staggered along Camden Road, in the direction of his flat, where Tracy and their baby son were asleep. He was less than 10 minutes walk from home when he collapsed under the railway bridge from which his poster would later hang. </p> <p>Tracy was woken by one of Ronald's distraught friends. 'It's serious,' he said. 'I'm not joking.' He gave her the hospital's number. </p> <p>'I knew as soon as I spoke to them that he was dead. They asked me to describe him. They wouldn't tell me anything, but said they'd send a police car.' The car never came. </p> <p>At no time was a 999 call to the police made from the bar. The police arrived, and promptly, because they were summoned by a nearby businessman who saw the commotion. Barzaar did not react in the manner which inspired confidence in its role as a licensed premise. The bar's owner was determined not to let the murder interfere with usual business. Julie explained her family's feelings on the matter. </p> <p>'The club had to be sealed off for a while, but within nine days they were up and trading again as normal. I saw that as a huge insult. Ronald's body was kept as evidence.' </p> <p>'For nine weeks I couldn't bury my child,' Daisy added. </p> <p>The Hinksons were sickened. They mounted a vigil outside Barzaar and put together a petition to have it closed down. As they stood in front of the bar collecting signatures, they began to hear a rumour repeatedly mentioned. Barzaar, people said, was frequented by the same north London crime family my friend from Queen's Crescent had told me controlled the local drug market. </p> <p>The police have consistently denied that there is any evidence linking the family to the events that night at Barzaar. DCI Sweeney was firm if not adamant. 'People say they are behind everything,' he said. 'In almost every murder that takes place in north London their name is mentioned.' </p> <p>In a sense, the family have become modern-day bogeymen. Ever since they came to public attention, they have been accused of a daunting number of crimes and have been associated with a still-larger number of 'legitimate' money-laundering operations. That their name does not exist on any papers concerning the pubs, clubs and mini-cab firms they supposedly run does little to undermine the rumours. Indeed, their absence from the documentation, say their accusers, serves as proof of their backdoor involvement. </p> <p>But very few people really know. And those who do, don't talk. What is certain, though, is that the man who is the sole suspect in Ronald's murder disappeared shortly after it was committed. Around Kentish Town his name is openly discussed. They say he is abroad. There were reports a while back that he was in Spain. </p> <p>The apparent speed and ease with which the suspect vanished has only added weight to the speculation that he was aided by organised criminals. That suspicion is further deepened by his continuing ability to remain beyond the reach of the law. </p> <p>And, perhaps most notably, the \u00a321,000 reward on offer seems to have had next to no effect in pinpointing the murderer's whereabouts. The money was painstakingly raised by the Hinksons, including Ronald's stepfather Ozzie Gobay, from local people without at first any help from the police. </p> <p>The family was offended by the police attitude towards the reward, a slight which compounded the communication problems between the two. Then the police had a change of heart and donated some money. </p> <p>'Up until this case,' DCI Sweeney informed me, 'the Met had never contributed to a reward. This case made history.' </p> <p>The only source from which the family pointedly refused to accept money was the owner of Barzaar. The bar was eventually closed when it was refused a new licence by Camden Council, but before that decision was made the Hinksons' picket had effectively prevented Barzaar from opening again as a workable concern. </p> <p>However, the bar's former landlord is still in business in the area. He runs a pub in a leafy neighbourhood that, while less than a mile from the spot where Ronald was killed, seems a world away from gangsters and weapons and drug dealers. I visited the well-known pub to speak to the man, to ask him what he knew of the murder, but the bar staff denied all knowledge of him. I checked with various sources, all of whom confirmed that I had the right man and the right place, and phoned the pub again a number of times. The same story. Never heard of him, said his staff, don't know who you're talking about. </p> <p>For whatever reasons, he clearly did not want to talk to me. In fact, very few people wanted to talk to me. Even Ronald's friends avoided my calls. </p> <p>'I suspect,' said DCI Sweeney, 'there are people that we have spoken to who haven't told us all they know.' </p> <p>Although a number of men took part in the attack on the two men who were beaten unconscious on the night of Ronald's murder, the police are not pursuing them on related charges. The decision has been made that it would not be in the public interest. </p> <p>At the same time, the police are unwilling to release any more information regarding the suspect for whom they're looking. They feel that to do so might jeopardise a trial. So no photos of the man the police want to interview will be issued. And, furthermore, the police say they do not know where he is. </p> <p>The rest is silence. Officially. Of course, people talk all the time. They talk about how the area of Ronald's and my childhood, of Queen's Crescent, has declined, about how bad the heroin and crack problem has become, about the guns and the gangsters, about how you can't trust anyone, and about how they want to move away. </p> <p>Ronald Hinkson had moved away. He was not a troublemaker but a peacemaker. He lived an unremarkable life in many ways. What marked him out was his willingness to stand up and intervene when he saw something he thought was wrong. He was killed because he tried to smooth a situation in which a friend was under threat for smoking a cannabis joint, in an environment that was warped by hard drugs and cowed by the criminals that supplied them. </p> <p>The last time I drove through Kentish Town, I noticed that Ronald's poster had been taken down. His photo is gone but, if his memory means anything, its appeal remains: who will stand up for Ronald?</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the school photograph that was never taken, Ronald Hinkson does not stand out as a potential murder victim. Even allowing that there is no physiognomical protection against random violence, Ronald's good-naturedly mischievous expression was nothing if not disarming. He always looked somehow as if he got the joke and was prepared to share it with you. Group photographs from childhood contain a curiously magical quality. The viewer is instinctively drawn to look for clues in the subjects' faces, as if the secret of fate is hidden in their half-formed features. The school Ronald and I attended was too poorly organised to arrange a massed sitting for the camera, so all that is left to be studied are snapshots from evanescent memory. Among the school's 1,200 or so kids, I now know, was a senior government policy adviser, at least one murderer, an MP, an armed robber, numerous small-time crooks, and hundreds of blamelessly invisible members of society. Most, as far as I'm concerned, have disappeared, erased from recollection; a small minority are vague outlines, an assemblage of odd details and indistinct flashbacks; then there are 20 or 30 who remain vividly present. Ronald is part of the latter group, although he was a couple of years below me, which normally means below the radar of recall. A large boy, who grew up to be an imposingly large man, he had a sly grin and a casual stroll - what we used to call a 'bowl' - that were enough to set him apart. He lived a couple of streets from me, went to the same primary and secondary schools, and had a brother in my tutor group. I often saw Ronald around the neighbourhood and we'd usually exchange a smile or an acknowledgment, but we were never friends, just as we were never enemies. For some reason, which I never thought about, I liked him. And I was not alone. Over 1,000 people packed into a small church in Gospel Oak, north London, for his memorial service. When I read that he'd been killed, I felt a muted kind of sadness. I thought about his family and their loss, but I suppose I thought not unselfishly about myself, about the unseen proximity of death and the tragedy of meeting it in your thirties. And I thought about the aching smallness of it all. Ronald was murdered half a mile from his home, and less than a mile from our old school. He was in a bar on a night out with his friends. That was back in September 1997. I didn't follow the story very closely. After the initial shock, I stored the glumness away in a mental file that was beginning to overflow with bad news from my childhood neighbourhood: murders, drug wars, imprisoned friends, a cousin who'd become a junkie and petty criminal, another who'd committed suicide, stabbings, beatings and muggings - contemporary street life. All of this in the semi-gentrified area of Kentish Town. While I didn't exactly forget about Ron, I let him become another grim anecdote to share with people I'd run into from my teenage days. Then, just before Christmas, I was driving through Kentish Town when I saw a huge poster draped over a railway bridge. Emblazoned on it was an image of Ronald, not the amused kid in the imaginary school photo, but a grown man, a father it turned out, a pensive adult with plans and responsibilities. The message read: You know who killed Ronald Hinkson You know where his killer is You saw or heard what happened You could secure justice for Ron's family Underneath there was a Crimestoppers number to call and a police inquiry line. The message also included an offer of a reward of \u00a321,000. The wording was disturbing, more like an accusation aimed at unnamed locals than a communal appeal for information. The whole effect was immediately striking, not least because it made me realise that more than two years later the man responsible for Ronald's death had still not been found. How could someone be murdered in front of hundreds of witnesses and his killer get away? And why? Was he just in the wrong place at the wrong time or was the wrong of a deeper, more threatening nature? On the night he was slain, Ronald was taking part in a celebration that he and some of his friends had made an irregular social ritual. About once every couple of months, five or so friends would meet up for an evening to mark one of the group members' birthdays. Having become the father of a baby son, Reuben, earlier that year, Ronald seldom went out to pubs or clubs. He worked most nights as a graphic designer. On his last day alive, he spent the morning and afternoon laying a floor in the home he shared with his son's mother, Tracy Hill, in Camden Town. At that small flat, I visited Tracy one afternoon this spring. A resolute young woman with strong dark hair and a handsome face made unjustly sad, she spoke of Ronald and herself as a couple who were arriving at the good part of their lives. 'Having Reuben was the best thing that ever happened to us.' Photographs of Reuben decorated the walls and there was a striking shot of Ronald in sharp profile with close-shaved head, wearing a white T-shirt. 'He was terrible at DIY,' Tracy recalled. 'I usually did it all. But he was proud of the floor and my parents came to see it.' At around 5pm on 13 September 1997, Ronald and Tracy went to a neighbour's party for an hour or so until Ronald's friend Joel called by to pick him up. 'They left at about 6.30,' she remembered. Then, without pausing, she turned the everyday banality of that detail into crushing finality. 'And that was the last time I saw him.' Sometimes, especially after a spate of violent crime, there is a ready impression, picked up from press and TV reports, that people are murdered all the time. The reality is less dramatic and much less dangerous. Statistically, in any given year, there is a 1-in-80,000 chance of suffering a violent death. And the probability of being murdered by a stranger is significantly smaller, moving towards the 1-in-a-million mark. That figure begins to rise again, however, if you live in the inner city and you are male and black and under 35, like Ronald. But it's still negligible. In other words, neither Ronald nor Tracy had any reason to expect that evening to be his last. After collecting a couple of other friends, the group headed for the Vulture's Perch, a renovated pub in Kentish Town Road, the high street, that is already beginning to look ancient. The shops change and the pubs change - or at least their names do - but Kentish Town Road has remained stubbornly the same for as long as I can remember. There were now six friends - Joel, Gary, Richard, Nicholas, Gary and Ronald. Not that they would have been concerned with the symmetry, nor perhaps even noticed it, but three were black and three were white. Kentish Town is not immune to racism and there are pubs in which few black faces are seen. On the whole, though, it is an unaffectedly integrated area: Ronald's mix of friends was not in the least conspicuous. Richard had turned 30 and they were drinking champagne. By all accounts, it was a lively evening, and the group joshed with anyone who came within its orbit. When closing time arrived, they were keen to continue the celebrations. There were few options after 11pm. The choice was between the after-hours places in Little Cyprus, in Camden Town, or Barzaar, a late-night bar on Camden Road. Ronald said he knew a doorman at Barzaar. As they left the Vulture's, Ronald put a phone call in to Tracy to say he would be late. If the high street has stayed much the same over the years, the rest of Kentish Town has undergone huge changes. In the 70s and 80s, middle-class families moved into those parts of the neighbourhood whose Victorian housing had survived Camden Council's year-zero plan to replace terraced streets with council estates. In the 80s, and increasingly in the 90s, the drug economy replaced some of the traditional employment, such as the railways and Camden Council, which had off-loaded workers. Between 1992 and 1997, drug trafficking offences in the borough went up five-fold. It's a cycle that has been repeated in inner cities all over Britain. The only difference with Camden is that the results sit cheek-by-jowl with the equally dramatic influx of monied professionals. The effects have been particularly extreme in one corner of the borough, the area surrounding Queen's Crescent market, which is almost landlocked by railway lines and road-blocks. Walking with an old school friend around Queen's Crescent, where Ron and I grew up, I was surprised at the number of places he pointed out that are now drug-dealing houses. He told me about an old neighbour and schoolmate of ours who was jailed a couple of years ago for the murder of another local in what was described as a disagreement over drugs. Before the case came to trial, the main witness, who refused police protection, was also shot dead. Jesus, I thought, that's the kind of thing that happens in The Sopranos, not Kentish Town. 'Queen's Crescent has become a no-go area,' said another former resident, some weeks later, as we drove through. A few days previously, a 58-year-old woman had been sexually assaulted in Marsden Street, in the heart of the neighbourhood. Two days later a man was found dead, one block away, on the corner of Rhyl Street - my old street - and Malden Road. At first, people were saying he'd been shot. But a post-mortem found that he had died as a result of an epileptic fit. Yet rumours as to the cause of death persisted when it emerged that the previous day he'd been set upon by a gang of youths. It seemed instructive that the first assumption locals jumped to was that the poor man had been gunned down. My school friend, a giant hulk of a man, and not an easily intimidated character, was anxious to remain anonymous. According to him, the main dealers were linked in various ways to a north London crime family that has gained near legendary status for its ruthlessness. The family's name has been connected with countless murders as well as a multi-million pound drug empire. On the surface, Queen's Crescent makes for an unconvincing no-go area. For a start, a quarter of the Crescent itself is made up of much sought-after houses that sell for around \u00a3500,000. It's about three stops on the bus from Hampstead Heath: Keats House, expensive tea shops, Michael Foot. But it's also a street market that, like many places of its kind, is eerily deserted come evening, except for teenagers hanging uselessly on street corners, and boozed-up blokes stumbling between pubs. On a Saturday morning it can seem like a fictional community, a multi-generational Anglo-Irish-Caribbean tribe of gossips. On a Saturday night, it's not somewhere you'd choose to walk alone. A couple of years ago a man was shot as he left an off-licence in Queen's Crescent. The gunmen said only two words before he fired: 'You're dead.' 'Ronald knew people from Kentish Town who had got into trouble,' said Tracy. 'He didn't want to follow that path. He did things the right way. He had a real sense of justice.' On the map, the short distance Ronald moved from his family home in Queen's Crescent to his own place near Camden Square appears trivial. But it separated him from an inward-looking street culture that was turning nasty. His brother Michael told me that he thought Ronald, having left the Crescent, had not fully grasped the consequences of the changes that had taken place in the neighbourhood. 'Not long before he died,' recalled Michael, 'he tried to stop a fight between two old friends. They were arguing over drugs. I told him: \"Don't get caught in the middle. Things have got serious. These people use knives.\"' Ron's mother, Daisy Gobay, lives two streets from the Crescent in Grafton Terrace, a wide street with neat little houses in which Karl Marx once lived. Nearly three years ago, she received a call on a Saturday night that had already turned into a Sunday morning. It was from Tracy, telling her that Ronald was in the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead. She went immediately, but her son had already been pronounced dead on arrival at 1.30am. Daisy's compact home is filled with photographs of Ronald. A generous-hearted woman who is easily moved to laughter, she is not a mournful character by nature. But when she talks of her son, the sense of a mother's loss is chokingly obvious. 'I know I would say this because I am his mother,' she explained, 'but he was such a nice bloke.' Her daughter Julie, a legal representative with a diligent manner, carefully went over the information she had gathered from the police, Ronald's friends and talk on the street. But, to her own and her mother's continuing frustration, that information is severely limited. The police have been very protective of their evidence. And for a variety of reasons, Ronald's friends have only partial stories to tell. That leaves street talk. That Ronald's killer is free is of course distressing, but the confusion that surrounds the murder itself is an additional emotional burden for Ronald's family, and one that is unlikely to be lifted without a trial. At around the time Ronald and his friends arrived at Barzaar, they were met by two other men, a couple of black friends from south London. 'This is where the big blur comes in,' Julie told me. When the police arrived at Barzaar, they found one man unconscious outside the bar, another dazed and regaining consciousness and a third bleeding profusely under the railway bridge less than a hundred yards away. All of them were black. More than two hundred other customers were either milling around or streaming away. The only person to be arrested at the scene was the dazed man, who, on coming to, began shouting. DCI John Sweeney is now in charge of the Hinkson murder inquiry. When I visited him at the murder squad's headquarters in Hendon, he played down the significance of Ronald's friend's arrest. 'It would have been for his own protection,' he explained. DCI Sweeney is an engaging 40-year-old. There is little trace of pedantic Scotland Yard formality in his manner. He's open, without giving anything away, and not overly defensive, although he never goes so far as to accept police failings or incompetence. 'What I find surprising,' said Julie, 'is that when the police arrived, the 200 people on site all walked away. Then we had this pathetic appeals for witnesses to come forward the following week.' She says the police did not even interview Ronald's friends that night and that it was only after Daisy made one of them go along to the station the next day that the police agreed to speak to him about what he'd seen. 'Other than the stabbing,' counters DCI Sweeney, 'the scene would have looked very much like any other Saturday-night fight when the police arrived. It's impossible to hold that many people. The first priority is preserving life, then the scene of the crime.' In her experience, Julie had found the police were more than capable of containing that number of people. 'I've been to black clubs and there has been trouble and the police lock you in and you have to say who you are to leave.' Here is the unspoken issue that has dogged, without ever quite dominating, the case: race. Ronald and the four other black men who made up his party were possibly the only black people in Barzaar that night. Two of them were badly beaten up and the the third, Ronald, was murdered. It was not unheard of for black people to go to the bar, but they were the exception. The image Barzaar had was of a hang-out for white toughs, men who either wanted to look the part of the well-connected hardnut - so-called plastic gangsters - or who were well-connected hardnuts, the real thing. 'That's where the chaps went,' one local told me, meaning the 'faces', the kind of people who boasted a reputation and, not infrequently, a record. Ernest James, chair of Camden's licensing committee, described the bar as a 'safe place to be for a certain class of person' and somewhere that attracted a 'working-class racist element'. The first officer to lead the inquiry, chief inspector David Brown, discounted the notion of a racially motivated crime pretty much from the outset. Daisy, in particular, was disappointed by what she saw as a reluctance on the police's behalf to explore the question of race, particularly as none of the three white men in Ronald's party was injured or, indeed, attacked. 'If they [the police] had found a blonde girl stabbed to death,' Julie suggested, 'I think they would have reacted more quickly and more effectively.' DCI Brown was replaced last year by DCI Sweeney. Before he left the case, his investigation was taken to task by the local newspaper, Camden New Journal, which voiced some of Daisy's complaints. As tensions grew between the Hinksons and the police, the findings of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry were making headlines. The Metropolitan Police were held responsible for 'institutional racism' - a charge which the botched initial investigation of the murder of Michael Menson, the black musician who was set alight by a gang, served only to underline. Brown sued the newspaper, which settled out of court. At the time the Journal ran its piece, the case papers had been sent for review to Assistant Commissioner John Grieve, the head of the Racial and Violent Crimes Task Force. It was Grieve's men who relabelled Menson's 'suicide' a homicide and went on to bring his killers to justice. DCI Sweeney says that Grieve has maintained a watching brief on Ronald's murder, and has been on hand for advice if needed, but that essentially the crime is not being treated as racial, although, he adds, the police are sensitive to any issues connected to race. Grieve helped launch a new appeal for evidence in the case when he unveiled the railway bridge poster to the press. Relations between the Hinksons and the police have improved since Sweeney's appointment. One of the recommendations of the Lawrence inquiry that has since become standard practice was the assignment of a family liaison officer. DC Curtis visits Daisy and Julie once a week, as well as seeing Tracy Hill. For Tracy, being able to talk to someone has made a difference. 'The liaison officer is fantastic,' she told me. Daisy and Julie are also appreciative but impatient at what they see as the slow progress of the inquiry. 'He [the liaison officer] tells us what he can but he can't tell us anything,' Julie said. 'But he tries. There is access now.' Daisy has begun to worry that no one will be arrested for Ronald's murder. Yet DCI Sweeney remains confident that, as with most murders, this one will be solved and the police will get their man. But who killed Ronald and why? And where is he now? Once inside Barzaar, Ronald and his friends continued the party. It was the first time Ron had ever been to the bar, despite living nearby. His brother felt that it was not the kind of place a black man should have gone unless he was certain of what to expect. But the atmosphere was heady and Ronald was in high spirits. As his sister put it to me: 'Apart from the murder, it was a good night.' At a point just after 12.30am, an argument started. Accounts differ as to its origin because some of Ronald's friends say they were in the lavatory or were out of ear shot. But none would speak to me. From witness statements, DCI Sweeney was able to tell me that a dispute apparently arose between one of Ronald's party and a man who may or may not have been working at the bar. It seems that Ronald's friend might have been smoking a joint. 'Ronald doesn't take drugs,' said his brother, using the present tense of bereavement. 'My son's a big fella,' Daisy said. 'I've got a feeling one of his friends was getting mistreated and he stepped in.' According to some testaments, Ronald intervened as a mediator, attempting to calm the situation. The man then said something to Ronald and thrust a glass in his face. Whatever happened next was viciously quick and hauntingly beyond reason. Ronald and two of his friends were pushed outside and followed by a large gang of men. The two friends were knocked out. They think they were attacked with baseball bats. Ronald was stabbed 10 times. Two of the wounds - in the neck and the heart - were fatal. No one reported hearing any racial slurs or insults and thus the police informed Daisy early on in the investigation that they did not think racism came into play. 'But how can you stab someone 10 times without hatred?' she asked me. Standing 6ft 2in and weighing nearly 20 stone, Ronald was indeed a big man. More than that, he was a big black man, and in our society that makes many people nervous. Ronald himself knew how he could be wrongly perceived. 'Ron was aware that people would judge him on sight,' said Tracy, who is white. 'But he never accepted that. He would mix with anyone and, because of that, he rarely came up against racism.' What Ronald came up against that night may not have been racism, but it was, as his mother rightly said, a demonstration of hatred. His life bleeding away, Ronald staggered along Camden Road, in the direction of his flat, where Tracy and their baby son were asleep. He was less than 10 minutes walk from home when he collapsed under the railway bridge from which his poster would later hang. Tracy was woken by one of Ronald's distraught friends. 'It's serious,' he said. 'I'm not joking.' He gave her the hospital's number. 'I knew as soon as I spoke to them that he was dead. They asked me to describe him. They wouldn't tell me anything, but said they'd send a police car.' The car never came. At no time was a 999 call to the police made from the bar. The police arrived, and promptly, because they were summoned by a nearby businessman who saw the commotion. Barzaar did not react in the manner which inspired confidence in its role as a licensed premise. The bar's owner was determined not to let the murder interfere with usual business. Julie explained her family's feelings on the matter. 'The club had to be sealed off for a while, but within nine days they were up and trading again as normal. I saw that as a huge insult. Ronald's body was kept as evidence.' 'For nine weeks I couldn't bury my child,' Daisy added. The Hinksons were sickened. They mounted a vigil outside Barzaar and put together a petition to have it closed down. As they stood in front of the bar collecting signatures, they began to hear a rumour repeatedly mentioned. Barzaar, people said, was frequented by the same north London crime family my friend from Queen's Crescent had told me controlled the local drug market. The police have consistently denied that there is any evidence linking the family to the events that night at Barzaar. DCI Sweeney was firm if not adamant. 'People say they are behind everything,' he said. 'In almost every murder that takes place in north London their name is mentioned.' In a sense, the family have become modern-day bogeymen. Ever since they came to public attention, they have been accused of a daunting number of crimes and have been associated with a still-larger number of 'legitimate' money-laundering operations. That their name does not exist on any papers concerning the pubs, clubs and mini-cab firms they supposedly run does little to undermine the rumours. Indeed, their absence from the documentation, say their accusers, serves as proof of their backdoor involvement. But very few people really know. And those who do, don't talk. What is certain, though, is that the man who is the sole suspect in Ronald's murder disappeared shortly after it was committed. Around Kentish Town his name is openly discussed. They say he is abroad. There were reports a while back that he was in Spain. The apparent speed and ease with which the suspect vanished has only added weight to the speculation that he was aided by organised criminals. That suspicion is further deepened by his continuing ability to remain beyond the reach of the law. And, perhaps most notably, the \u00a321,000 reward on offer seems to have had next to no effect in pinpointing the murderer's whereabouts. The money was painstakingly raised by the Hinksons, including Ronald's stepfather Ozzie Gobay, from local people without at first any help from the police. The family was offended by the police attitude towards the reward, a slight which compounded the communication problems between the two. Then the police had a change of heart and donated some money. 'Up until this case,' DCI Sweeney informed me, 'the Met had never contributed to a reward. This case made history.' The only source from which the family pointedly refused to accept money was the owner of Barzaar. The bar was eventually closed when it was refused a new licence by Camden Council, but before that decision was made the Hinksons' picket had effectively prevented Barzaar from opening again as a workable concern. However, the bar's former landlord is still in business in the area. He runs a pub in a leafy neighbourhood that, while less than a mile from the spot where Ronald was killed, seems a world away from gangsters and weapons and drug dealers. I visited the well-known pub to speak to the man, to ask him what he knew of the murder, but the bar staff denied all knowledge of him. I checked with various sources, all of whom confirmed that I had the right man and the right place, and phoned the pub again a number of times. The same story. Never heard of him, said his staff, don't know who you're talking about. For whatever reasons, he clearly did not want to talk to me. In fact, very few people wanted to talk to me. Even Ronald's friends avoided my calls. 'I suspect,' said DCI Sweeney, 'there are people that we have spoken to who haven't told us all they know.' Although a number of men took part in the attack on the two men who were beaten unconscious on the night of Ronald's murder, the police are not pursuing them on related charges. The decision has been made that it would not be in the public interest. At the same time, the police are unwilling to release any more information regarding the suspect for whom they're looking. They feel that to do so might jeopardise a trial. So no photos of the man the police want to interview will be issued. And, furthermore, the police say they do not know where he is. The rest is silence. Officially. Of course, people talk all the time. They talk about how the area of Ronald's and my childhood, of Queen's Crescent, has declined, about how bad the heroin and crack problem has become, about the guns and the gangsters, about how you can't trust anyone, and about how they want to move away. Ronald Hinkson had moved away. He was not a troublemaker but a peacemaker. He lived an unremarkable life in many ways. What marked him out was his willingness to stand up and intervene when he saw something he thought was wrong. He was killed because he tried to smooth a situation in which a friend was under threat for smoking a cannabis joint, in an environment that was warped by hard drugs and cowed by the criminals that supplied them. The last time I drove through Kentish Town, I noticed that Ronald's poster had been taken down. His photo is gone but, if his memory means anything, its appeal remains: who will stand up for Ronald?",

      "body": "<p>Odd to see a 63-year-old economics expert announcing excitedly to camera, 'I have learned two big things - one is that money is brilliantly useful and the other is that it tells the world who you are!' Gosh, even I know that - you'd think Peter Jay would have learned it by now, what with his Winchester schooling, his Oxford first in PPE, his Treasury background, his long career as an economics journalist, and his current post as head of economics at the BBC. Admittedly, we all might have forgotten the latter because he is a very rare visitor to our screens, but he has held the job for the past 10 years, and you'd expect knowledge of the usefulness of money to be part of the remit.</p> <p>Sneaky colleagues complain that he has not been seen in his BBC office for years and that last time he appeared onscreen, for the Budget, he had to have a special briefing. But now all is explained. For the past three years, since the 1997 election, he has been working on a 'landmark' television series which will tell the economic history of man from caveman to computer wizard. It is called Road to Riches, and starts on 9 July.</p> <p>You can certainly see the riches on the screen - Proust with an all-star cast might have been cheaper. Jay complains that budgetary constraints forced him to miss out India, but he manages to visit China, Turkey, Jordan, Greece, Italy (where he bumps into Roy Hattersley for a quick chinwag about Diocletian), South America, North America and even the Yap Islands of the Pacific, where the currency is large round immoveable boulders. The road to riches, it seems, is location, location, location.</p> <p>Jay ambles round the world like a sluggish David Attenborough, wearing one of those white canvas sunhats that are only ever seen on elderly public-school Englishmen abroad, and once or twice unforgivably wearing lace-up shoes with shorts. According to the series editor Barbara Want, it was a nightmare to dress him at all - he is a man who refuses to enter shops and believes that fashion is 'logically and morally objectionable' - so she had to kit him out with an overcoat, a jacket, an anorak, shirts, trousers and a fur hat for Russia. His only contribution was the sunhat. 'He was really thrilled,' she says sweetly, 'to get all these new clothes.'</p> <p>Younger viewers, seeing this harmless old buffer on television, will be puzzled as to why their elders suddenly start shouting at the screen. But the name Peter Jay rouses extraordinary ire in my generation. I have friends who remember exactly where they were standing in May 1977 when they heard that he was being appointed British Ambassador to the United States. It was the most blatant nepotism, and from a Labour prime minister - Peter Jay was married to Jim Callaghan's daughter Margaret (now Baroness Jay). He was supposed to be 'the cleverest young man in England', but nothing in his previous career - civil servant at the Treasury, TV presenter, economics columnist for The Times - entitled him to the top job in diplomacy, and he was already, even then at 40, beginning to look like a rocket that had fizzled. In fact, he was a perfectly good ambassador till he was recalled by Mrs Thatcher, but the fury aroused by that appointment can never be erased, and partly explains the gleeful Schadenfreude that has greeted every stage in his subsequent downfall.</p> <p>And downfall it has been. Soon after he returned from the Embassy, Nora Ephron published a wickedly funny novel, Heart- burn, saying that while he was ambassador, his wife was having an affair with her husband Carl Bernstein, The Washington Post journalist of Watergate fame. This was embarrassing enough, but a year or two later, the Jays' nanny, Jane Tustian, revealed that while Margaret Jay was bonking Bernstein, Peter Jay was bonking her - and she had an illegitimate son to prove it. Jay was slow to accept paternity - he said the child could be by his rival-in-love, the embassy chauffeur - and Tustian had to take him to court and get a blood test before he would pay maintenance. Naturally, the tabloids went to town.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Peter Jay had found new work setting up TV-am, to bid for the ITV breakfast franchise. He won the franchise and launched the station with much ballyhoo about its 'mission to explain' and its Famous Five presenters (David Frost, Angela Rippon, Michael Parkinson, Anna Ford and Robert Kee). Viewers turned off in droves. A month after the launch, the ratings were down to 400,000 and Jay resigned, stabbed not in the back but in the front by his co-director and former friend Jonathan Aitken in a boardroom coup. Greg Dyke stepped in to save the station with Roland Rat.</p> <p>Jay resurfaced two years later in a very strange job, as Robert Maxwell's 'Chief of Staff' according to himself, or 'Head of Paperclips' according to the staff. Maxwell would wheel him in to meet visiting bigwigs and address him as 'Mr Ambassador' - but would also ring him in the middle of the night to ask what time it was, or call him in for 'crisis' meetings at the weekend about why a secretary had misfiled a letter. He also ordered him to bug Tom Bower's house when Bower was writing his Maxwell biography. Jay didn't do it - but he did discuss it with a security firm. He was finally rescued by his old friend John Birt, who made him head of economics at the BBC. He gave a brilliant account of the events of Black Wednesday in 1992, but has rarely appeared since.</p> <p>A curious career then, much of which is commemorated in the study at his home in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, which is effectively a Peter Jay museum. The only person I have interviewed with a similar shrine to themselves is Edward Heath, but Heath's shrine is considerably smaller than Jay's which fills a whole converted barn. His HM Ambassador briefcase has pride of place on top of the bookcase, then there is an array of sailing mementos - he owned an ocean- going yacht for 18 years - and hundreds, literally hundreds, of photographs of himself looking thoughtful, looking dashing, looking macho at the helm of his yacht, meeting world leaders, meeting royalty, sharing a joke with the Famous Five. Many of the photos show him with Margaret Jay; hardly any show him with Emma, his second. If I were Emma I would torch the lot, but she is obviously far too nice. The book of Road to Riches is dedicated to her and to his seven children and first grandchild.</p> <p>The Road to Riches begins, 'After sex, money is our second appetite. Understand- ing comes third.' This is a peculiar statement because of course most people put sustenance first (and judging from the size of his stomach Jay does, too), but it gives the BBC an excuse to show a cheesy nude couple with an apple, supposedly Adam and Eve, in the opening credits. Anyway, it's nice to know he's keen on sex - but does he really put money that high?</p> <p>'Oh I'm sure I like money. One of the reasons why I was quite keen to get into television was it paid for that...,' he waves his hand at all the photographs of his yacht. 'I had this great ambition, call it a dream, call it what you like, to sail across the ocean - and boats cost money. So I am absolutely not indifferent to money. I love money and I'm very keen to have money.'</p> <p>But he is not 'good with money' - on the contrary, he says, he's useless when it comes to investments, is permanently bearish, never believes in buying shares, and thinks the whole stock market is a lottery. (And he has never bought a lottery ticket either.) In fact his attitude to money, for all his vast economics expertise, seems to be on much the same peasant-cunning level as mine, or at least that seems to be the moral of the curious story he told me about his watch.</p> <p>I asked about his watch because it seemed so out of keeping with his clothes. His clothes consisted of scruffy old trousers and a shirt so shrunken and threadbare it barely met across his gut. But his watch was a flashy gold bracelet job, as worn by bookmakers and friends of Arabs. He said it was a Rolex Oyster Perpetual GMT Master, and he acquired it thus: 'I once had an old metal Rolex watch which I used mainly for sailing and I took it in to be serviced and Rolex lost it. This was in about 1973. And they said they would replace it with a new watch of the same type - or , they said, I could buy any watch from their catalogue at 40 per cent of its retail price. So I said, \"Well I'll have the most expensive watch then\", because I thought to myself in a rather naughty way, \"I will insure it, because I'm bound to lose it sooner or later, and then I will make a huge profit\" - though I wouldn't lose it deliberately because that would be dishonest. And I've had it for 27 years and I'm still waiting to lose it!'</p> <p>Is this how economics experts are supposed to think? It seems a bit odd to me - a) to do it, and b) to tell a journalist about it. His guilelessness is almost charming - almost, but not quite. It was talking to people who'd worked for him that was the real stiffener - they loathe him. Several people told me as a matter of fact that he is 'the most hated person in the BBC'. He sucks up to important people and doesn't bother with underlings. He slights people constantly. The journalist Joanna Coles remembers once sitting next to him at a dinner and him giving her a brief once-over and turning to the more attractive woman on his other side and never uttering another word to her. He famously told a Times sub-editor who queried something in his copy that he was writing for three people in the world and he - the sub-editor - wasn't one of them.</p> <p>In the preface to Road to Riches he takes a swipe at the 'clerks and clowns' in the BBC accounts department who dared to query his expenses. It doesn't seem to occur to him that most readers of his book will be licence-payers who quite favour the idea of licence money being accountable. But he sees the world as his fan club; he imagines we must all be as devoted to promoting the comfort and enrichment of Peter Jay as he is himself. It is arrogance, but also a sort of naivety.</p> <p>He grew up in Hampstead intellectual royalty - his father Douglas Jay MP was a Labour Minister (and, incidentally, a notorious womaniser); his mother was a GLC councillor. He went through prep school and Winchester winning all the prizes, with the applause of schoolmasters ringing in his ears. 'I was one of those people who always found it great fun to compete. Everything was a form of game. You were put on square one of the board - whether it was history or maths or cricket or chess or life - and you went ahead, competitively enjoying the game.' At Oxford he was hailed by his tutors as 'the cleverest young man in England' - an epithet he now deplores but to which his response at the time was, 'Is there someone cleverer in Wales?'</p> <p>But in one respect he was entirely ignorant. 'I could almost literally say I never met a member of the opposite sex, apart from my mother and grandmother, till I was past 21.' So when he met Margaret Callaghan, daughter of the future prime minister, at an Oxford dance, she was almost the first girl he ever met and he was quite knocked out by her. 'I was astonishingly lucky, I think - perhaps she was unlucky . The experience to me was so transforming that I wished to hold on for ever and ever, and I think she got railroaded in a way which was unfair on her because she was very young, she was 19. I think she had doubts but she wasn't allowed to express them, because my enthusiasm would brook no hesitation.'</p> <p>They married in 1961 as soon as they graduated, and had three children. But he was soon unfaithful. Typically, he had a theory about marriage, which he now thinks was immature. 'I think I deceived myself by the sort of logically, apparently persuasive argument that something that nobody ever knew about couldn't possibly affect anything. And yet I also thought that the very strict traditional Victorian kind of morality was all a lot of eyewash. And the upshot of all of that was that you end up sort of playing God with your life. You assume that you have much more control than you do. You don't control in the end what people do or don't know, and what consequences it has.'</p> <p>In other words, he was unfaithful and got found out. If Nora Ephron's Heartburn is to be believed, Margaret Jay also had several affairs, which he knew about. But her affair with Carl Bernstein was something different: she wanted to divorce Jay and marry him. Peter Jay refused to believe it and stayed in Washington for a year after he left the Embassy trying to win her back. 'I didn't think that I had lost my wife then; I thought that Humpty Dumpty could be put back together again. And for another four or five years I tried very hard to do that but I was wrong - it wasn't possible.'</p> <p>They only finally divorced in 1985, and he married Emma Thornton the next year. She was a history teacher and furniture designer, young enough to be his daughter, whom he met through sailing. He always wanted to be married. 'I am very uxorious. I detest being on my own. And on the occasions when I found myself on my own, I was very active in filling that void in one way or another - not, for quite a while, in ways which were really very grown-up or satisfactory.' (This is presumably a discreet reference to the nanny.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, his career was spiralling downhill throughout the 80s, from the fiasco of TV-am, to the humiliation of working for Maxwell. He says, 'There's a sense in which, after the Embassy, I ceased to have any feeling of a career, or a trajectory. I thereafter thought of all my working activities as a kind of epilogue.' And he admits that he was always wrong about what he was good at: he thought he was good at running big organisations, but he now accepts, or partly accepts, that he is better working on his own.</p> <p>Nevertheless, he doesn't see TV-am as a fiasco: he won the franchise, he got the station up and running, it wasn't his fault (why not?) that the programmes were so dire. But here again he was a victim of his own naivety or his inability to understand other people. He compares himself to Othello being taken in by Iago - the Iago, presumably, being Jonathan Aitken, though he doesn't confirm it. 'I find it exceedingly difficult, and have done all my life, to believe that the person I'm talking to is not everything that they seem to be. And yet I have been deceived, almost disastrously so, twice in my working life, once at TV-am and once at the Embassy. I had quite unintentionally and unconsciously slighted somebody, and the hatred and the venom and the passion which that engendered, and then the sustained series of absolutely disastrous acts of sabotage on their part was pure Iago. I think I am naive.'</p> <p>Naivety again accounts for his willingness to work for Maxwell for three-and-a-half years. Many of his good friends, including Richard Ingrams and Paul Foot, warned him about Maxwell but he wouldn't believe them - and indeed, still maintains (naively?) that there were no signs of financial chicanery while he was there. But it was a horrible job. He was supposed to be bringing some order to the office - 'very elementary things like keeping copies of letters - but it soon became apparent that not only was he incapable of orderly behaviour, he actively abhorred it. I wrote a very funny farewell dispatch to my designated successor, which I still think is one of the funniest documents I've ever written.'</p> <p>He gives me a photocopy. It is headed Ave atque vale and begins, 'The Chief of Staff is Head of the Departments of Extreme Emergencies and of Insoluble Problems. He is Keeper of the Royal Oilcan and Steward of the Imperial Bottleneck. He is responsible for everything and in charge of nothing. He is expected to know everything; and he expects to be told nothing. His only success is the avoidance of disaster. His only goal is to finish ploughing the sands before the next tide comes in.'</p> <p>There are another four pages of Prince Charles-ish humour, describing an impossible job. And yet he still talks almost fondly of Maxwell. 'I mean he was maddening, he was ridiculous, he was outrageous, absurd, intolerable, gross - he was very pathetic , fundamentally. The real explanation of his behaviour, in my opinion, was that he lived in terror of boredom, and the great black hole of boredom seemed to be rolling towards him all the time - which explains the completely random nature of his activities, just activity for activity's sake. He had no interests, no hobbies, no friends - just fidget, fidget, fidget. There was an aspect of him - I don't say this to excuse him - that was like a woolly mammoth stomping through some primeval forest. It was hungry or it was sexed up, and it stalked through the undergrowth, bumping into things, squashing things, standing on things - not immoral so much as pre-moral - and you could at moments feel something bordering on pity and affection for him.'</p> <p>But the real reason why he went to work for Maxwell was that he was desperate. He had been out of a job for two years and 'not having a job was driving me nuts. And getting the job gave me the sort of economic self-confidence to feel that yes, I could start up again and marry Emma and have another family. And the joy of actually doing that was incomparable and infinitely more important to my happiness than anything that was going on at the office. So in that sense it was a very happy time in my life. However, this is getting rather sentimental.'</p> <p>It is indeed - there are tears in his eyes. I find myself strangely unmoved, pondering Julie Burchill's theory that the people who cry most readily are always the ones with the least feelings for other people - they cry for themselves. Jane Tustian, the nanny, once said of Peter Jay, 'He's quite an emotionless man, isn't he?' A friend who worked for him in the 70s described him as 'Inhuman - he saw everything as a chess game.' He once said a very odd and interesting thing about his children. He said, 'I think I saw them as real human beings long before I saw myself as a real human being.' In other words, he eventually learned to believe in the existence of emotions by observing them in his children, but was slow to master the proper feeling of them himself.</p> <p>Jay says that his attitude to marriage is different the second time around, and that he has learned lessons from the failure of his first marriage. 'One overriding conclusion I have drawn is never never never never never play games, never lie.' Never be unfaithful? 'Absolutely. I don't want to lay down the law for other people because I think that is odious, but you have to lay down the law for yourself. And one thing I took away from the one situation and brought into the other was: never ever ever again any of all that, thank you very much, never ever ever.'</p> <p>He seems idyllically happy with Emma and their three sons - he is a very doting father. But having three boys aged eight to 11 to educate, of course at public school, means he will have to keep working. He is 63, but says ominously, 'Alistair Cooke is still doing fine.' He plans to resume his 'normal duties' at the BBC and do bulletins as necessary and the occasional Panorama or Money Programme . This all assumes that Dyke wants him. Jay says they are friends, though they have never worked together, and that he has written to tell Dyke that 'In programme three of this series, there will be a rat, whom I've called Roland Rat, who is an important part of our mission to explain the Black Death!' He seems to think this will thrill Dyke. It could be another mark of his naivety.</p> <p>\u0095 Road to Riches, a six-part series, starts at 8pm on BBC2 on 9 July</p>",

      "bodyText": "Odd to see a 63-year-old economics expert announcing excitedly to camera, 'I have learned two big things - one is that money is brilliantly useful and the other is that it tells the world who you are!' Gosh, even I know that - you'd think Peter Jay would have learned it by now, what with his Winchester schooling, his Oxford first in PPE, his Treasury background, his long career as an economics journalist, and his current post as head of economics at the BBC. Admittedly, we all might have forgotten the latter because he is a very rare visitor to our screens, but he has held the job for the past 10 years, and you'd expect knowledge of the usefulness of money to be part of the remit. Sneaky colleagues complain that he has not been seen in his BBC office for years and that last time he appeared onscreen, for the Budget, he had to have a special briefing. But now all is explained. For the past three years, since the 1997 election, he has been working on a 'landmark' television series which will tell the economic history of man from caveman to computer wizard. It is called Road to Riches, and starts on 9 July. You can certainly see the riches on the screen - Proust with an all-star cast might have been cheaper. Jay complains that budgetary constraints forced him to miss out India, but he manages to visit China, Turkey, Jordan, Greece, Italy (where he bumps into Roy Hattersley for a quick chinwag about Diocletian), South America, North America and even the Yap Islands of the Pacific, where the currency is large round immoveable boulders. The road to riches, it seems, is location, location, location. Jay ambles round the world like a sluggish David Attenborough, wearing one of those white canvas sunhats that are only ever seen on elderly public-school Englishmen abroad, and once or twice unforgivably wearing lace-up shoes with shorts. According to the series editor Barbara Want, it was a nightmare to dress him at all - he is a man who refuses to enter shops and believes that fashion is 'logically and morally objectionable' - so she had to kit him out with an overcoat, a jacket, an anorak, shirts, trousers and a fur hat for Russia. His only contribution was the sunhat. 'He was really thrilled,' she says sweetly, 'to get all these new clothes.' Younger viewers, seeing this harmless old buffer on television, will be puzzled as to why their elders suddenly start shouting at the screen. But the name Peter Jay rouses extraordinary ire in my generation. I have friends who remember exactly where they were standing in May 1977 when they heard that he was being appointed British Ambassador to the United States. It was the most blatant nepotism, and from a Labour prime minister - Peter Jay was married to Jim Callaghan's daughter Margaret (now Baroness Jay). He was supposed to be 'the cleverest young man in England', but nothing in his previous career - civil servant at the Treasury, TV presenter, economics columnist for The Times - entitled him to the top job in diplomacy, and he was already, even then at 40, beginning to look like a rocket that had fizzled. In fact, he was a perfectly good ambassador till he was recalled by Mrs Thatcher, but the fury aroused by that appointment can never be erased, and partly explains the gleeful Schadenfreude that has greeted every stage in his subsequent downfall. And downfall it has been. Soon after he returned from the Embassy, Nora Ephron published a wickedly funny novel, Heart- burn, saying that while he was ambassador, his wife was having an affair with her husband Carl Bernstein, The Washington Post journalist of Watergate fame. This was embarrassing enough, but a year or two later, the Jays' nanny, Jane Tustian, revealed that while Margaret Jay was bonking Bernstein, Peter Jay was bonking her - and she had an illegitimate son to prove it. Jay was slow to accept paternity - he said the child could be by his rival-in-love, the embassy chauffeur - and Tustian had to take him to court and get a blood test before he would pay maintenance. Naturally, the tabloids went to town. Meanwhile, Peter Jay had found new work setting up TV-am, to bid for the ITV breakfast franchise. He won the franchise and launched the station with much ballyhoo about its 'mission to explain' and its Famous Five presenters (David Frost, Angela Rippon, Michael Parkinson, Anna Ford and Robert Kee). Viewers turned off in droves. A month after the launch, the ratings were down to 400,000 and Jay resigned, stabbed not in the back but in the front by his co-director and former friend Jonathan Aitken in a boardroom coup. Greg Dyke stepped in to save the station with Roland Rat. Jay resurfaced two years later in a very strange job, as Robert Maxwell's 'Chief of Staff' according to himself, or 'Head of Paperclips' according to the staff. Maxwell would wheel him in to meet visiting bigwigs and address him as 'Mr Ambassador' - but would also ring him in the middle of the night to ask what time it was, or call him in for 'crisis' meetings at the weekend about why a secretary had misfiled a letter. He also ordered him to bug Tom Bower's house when Bower was writing his Maxwell biography. Jay didn't do it - but he did discuss it with a security firm. He was finally rescued by his old friend John Birt, who made him head of economics at the BBC. He gave a brilliant account of the events of Black Wednesday in 1992, but has rarely appeared since. A curious career then, much of which is commemorated in the study at his home in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, which is effectively a Peter Jay museum. The only person I have interviewed with a similar shrine to themselves is Edward Heath, but Heath's shrine is considerably smaller than Jay's which fills a whole converted barn. His HM Ambassador briefcase has pride of place on top of the bookcase, then there is an array of sailing mementos - he owned an ocean- going yacht for 18 years - and hundreds, literally hundreds, of photographs of himself looking thoughtful, looking dashing, looking macho at the helm of his yacht, meeting world leaders, meeting royalty, sharing a joke with the Famous Five. Many of the photos show him with Margaret Jay; hardly any show him with Emma, his second. If I were Emma I would torch the lot, but she is obviously far too nice. The book of Road to Riches is dedicated to her and to his seven children and first grandchild. The Road to Riches begins, 'After sex, money is our second appetite. Understand- ing comes third.' This is a peculiar statement because of course most people put sustenance first (and judging from the size of his stomach Jay does, too), but it gives the BBC an excuse to show a cheesy nude couple with an apple, supposedly Adam and Eve, in the opening credits. Anyway, it's nice to know he's keen on sex - but does he really put money that high? 'Oh I'm sure I like money. One of the reasons why I was quite keen to get into television was it paid for that...,' he waves his hand at all the photographs of his yacht. 'I had this great ambition, call it a dream, call it what you like, to sail across the ocean - and boats cost money. So I am absolutely not indifferent to money. I love money and I'm very keen to have money.' But he is not 'good with money' - on the contrary, he says, he's useless when it comes to investments, is permanently bearish, never believes in buying shares, and thinks the whole stock market is a lottery. (And he has never bought a lottery ticket either.) In fact his attitude to money, for all his vast economics expertise, seems to be on much the same peasant-cunning level as mine, or at least that seems to be the moral of the curious story he told me about his watch. I asked about his watch because it seemed so out of keeping with his clothes. His clothes consisted of scruffy old trousers and a shirt so shrunken and threadbare it barely met across his gut. But his watch was a flashy gold bracelet job, as worn by bookmakers and friends of Arabs. He said it was a Rolex Oyster Perpetual GMT Master, and he acquired it thus: 'I once had an old metal Rolex watch which I used mainly for sailing and I took it in to be serviced and Rolex lost it. This was in about 1973. And they said they would replace it with a new watch of the same type - or , they said, I could buy any watch from their catalogue at 40 per cent of its retail price. So I said, \"Well I'll have the most expensive watch then\", because I thought to myself in a rather naughty way, \"I will insure it, because I'm bound to lose it sooner or later, and then I will make a huge profit\" - though I wouldn't lose it deliberately because that would be dishonest. And I've had it for 27 years and I'm still waiting to lose it!' Is this how economics experts are supposed to think? It seems a bit odd to me - a) to do it, and b) to tell a journalist about it. His guilelessness is almost charming - almost, but not quite. It was talking to people who'd worked for him that was the real stiffener - they loathe him. Several people told me as a matter of fact that he is 'the most hated person in the BBC'. He sucks up to important people and doesn't bother with underlings. He slights people constantly. The journalist Joanna Coles remembers once sitting next to him at a dinner and him giving her a brief once-over and turning to the more attractive woman on his other side and never uttering another word to her. He famously told a Times sub-editor who queried something in his copy that he was writing for three people in the world and he - the sub-editor - wasn't one of them. In the preface to Road to Riches he takes a swipe at the 'clerks and clowns' in the BBC accounts department who dared to query his expenses. It doesn't seem to occur to him that most readers of his book will be licence-payers who quite favour the idea of licence money being accountable. But he sees the world as his fan club; he imagines we must all be as devoted to promoting the comfort and enrichment of Peter Jay as he is himself. It is arrogance, but also a sort of naivety. He grew up in Hampstead intellectual royalty - his father Douglas Jay MP was a Labour Minister (and, incidentally, a notorious womaniser); his mother was a GLC councillor. He went through prep school and Winchester winning all the prizes, with the applause of schoolmasters ringing in his ears. 'I was one of those people who always found it great fun to compete. Everything was a form of game. You were put on square one of the board - whether it was history or maths or cricket or chess or life - and you went ahead, competitively enjoying the game.' At Oxford he was hailed by his tutors as 'the cleverest young man in England' - an epithet he now deplores but to which his response at the time was, 'Is there someone cleverer in Wales?' But in one respect he was entirely ignorant. 'I could almost literally say I never met a member of the opposite sex, apart from my mother and grandmother, till I was past 21.' So when he met Margaret Callaghan, daughter of the future prime minister, at an Oxford dance, she was almost the first girl he ever met and he was quite knocked out by her. 'I was astonishingly lucky, I think - perhaps she was unlucky . The experience to me was so transforming that I wished to hold on for ever and ever, and I think she got railroaded in a way which was unfair on her because she was very young, she was 19. I think she had doubts but she wasn't allowed to express them, because my enthusiasm would brook no hesitation.' They married in 1961 as soon as they graduated, and had three children. But he was soon unfaithful. Typically, he had a theory about marriage, which he now thinks was immature. 'I think I deceived myself by the sort of logically, apparently persuasive argument that something that nobody ever knew about couldn't possibly affect anything. And yet I also thought that the very strict traditional Victorian kind of morality was all a lot of eyewash. And the upshot of all of that was that you end up sort of playing God with your life. You assume that you have much more control than you do. You don't control in the end what people do or don't know, and what consequences it has.' In other words, he was unfaithful and got found out. If Nora Ephron's Heartburn is to be believed, Margaret Jay also had several affairs, which he knew about. But her affair with Carl Bernstein was something different: she wanted to divorce Jay and marry him. Peter Jay refused to believe it and stayed in Washington for a year after he left the Embassy trying to win her back. 'I didn't think that I had lost my wife then; I thought that Humpty Dumpty could be put back together again. And for another four or five years I tried very hard to do that but I was wrong - it wasn't possible.' They only finally divorced in 1985, and he married Emma Thornton the next year. She was a history teacher and furniture designer, young enough to be his daughter, whom he met through sailing. He always wanted to be married. 'I am very uxorious. I detest being on my own. And on the occasions when I found myself on my own, I was very active in filling that void in one way or another - not, for quite a while, in ways which were really very grown-up or satisfactory.' (This is presumably a discreet reference to the nanny.) Meanwhile, his career was spiralling downhill throughout the 80s, from the fiasco of TV-am, to the humiliation of working for Maxwell. He says, 'There's a sense in which, after the Embassy, I ceased to have any feeling of a career, or a trajectory. I thereafter thought of all my working activities as a kind of epilogue.' And he admits that he was always wrong about what he was good at: he thought he was good at running big organisations, but he now accepts, or partly accepts, that he is better working on his own. Nevertheless, he doesn't see TV-am as a fiasco: he won the franchise, he got the station up and running, it wasn't his fault (why not?) that the programmes were so dire. But here again he was a victim of his own naivety or his inability to understand other people. He compares himself to Othello being taken in by Iago - the Iago, presumably, being Jonathan Aitken, though he doesn't confirm it. 'I find it exceedingly difficult, and have done all my life, to believe that the person I'm talking to is not everything that they seem to be. And yet I have been deceived, almost disastrously so, twice in my working life, once at TV-am and once at the Embassy. I had quite unintentionally and unconsciously slighted somebody, and the hatred and the venom and the passion which that engendered, and then the sustained series of absolutely disastrous acts of sabotage on their part was pure Iago. I think I am naive.' Naivety again accounts for his willingness to work for Maxwell for three-and-a-half years. Many of his good friends, including Richard Ingrams and Paul Foot, warned him about Maxwell but he wouldn't believe them - and indeed, still maintains (naively?) that there were no signs of financial chicanery while he was there. But it was a horrible job. He was supposed to be bringing some order to the office - 'very elementary things like keeping copies of letters - but it soon became apparent that not only was he incapable of orderly behaviour, he actively abhorred it. I wrote a very funny farewell dispatch to my designated successor, which I still think is one of the funniest documents I've ever written.' He gives me a photocopy. It is headed Ave atque vale and begins, 'The Chief of Staff is Head of the Departments of Extreme Emergencies and of Insoluble Problems. He is Keeper of the Royal Oilcan and Steward of the Imperial Bottleneck. He is responsible for everything and in charge of nothing. He is expected to know everything; and he expects to be told nothing. His only success is the avoidance of disaster. His only goal is to finish ploughing the sands before the next tide comes in.' There are another four pages of Prince Charles-ish humour, describing an impossible job. And yet he still talks almost fondly of Maxwell. 'I mean he was maddening, he was ridiculous, he was outrageous, absurd, intolerable, gross - he was very pathetic , fundamentally. The real explanation of his behaviour, in my opinion, was that he lived in terror of boredom, and the great black hole of boredom seemed to be rolling towards him all the time - which explains the completely random nature of his activities, just activity for activity's sake.

But the real reason why he went to work for Maxwell was that he was desperate. He had been out of a job for two years and 'not having a job was driving me nuts.

We were an unconventional couple - all the excitement and intensity of a true lovematch, with the added piquancy that I never actually met him. A friend of mine, Fiona, was also having a relationship with Gary at exactly the same time. She'd never met Gary either, which hurt at first - was he stringing along every woman he'd never met? However, eventually, Fiona and I settled our differences, and decided to 'share' Gary - a bit like you'd share a KitKat, or the way Barbara Dickson and Elaine Paige share their man in the song 'I Know Him So Well', only with us it was more a case of 'We Don't Know Him At All'. </p> <p>If we were stalkers, we were the laziest, most unsuccessful stalkers you could hope to be stalked by. We didn't so much stalk as skulk in the house, snipping out newspaper shots of 'Gary in action'. Gary standing purposefully near the goal, waiting for the ball to be kicked his way. Gary standing purposefully near the goal, waiting for the ball to be headed his way. Gary simply standing purposefully near the goal. Was there no end to this man's versatility? Soon we'd accumulated huge amounts of clippings. They were festooned around the place, like those scenes in movies, when the cops eventually track down the serial killer in his photograph-strewn lair. Despite a mystifying lack of support from our then-boyfriends, we put our 'archives' to good use by producing our very own fanzine, entitled Ooh Gary, Gary! after the famous terrace chant. It was then our lives changed forever. Or something. </p> <p>Inadvertently, we'd managed to produce the first fanzine dedicated to one player, which had the bonus gimmick of being written by idiot females who clearly knew nothing about football. As if this wasn't achievement enough, we'd also managed to revolutionise the concept of 'match reporting' by neither attending the matches, nor reporting on them. No wonder, then, that as editors of Ooh Gary, Gary!, we were featured in magazines, and an interview with us giggling in short skirts about how much we 'admired' Gary was used on Grandstand. </p> <p>However, it wasn't all non-stop glamour and warm beer at When Saturday Comes parties. After meeting with us, Right To Reply decided to use someone else to front its report on 'Female Football Fans', apparently unimpressed by our argument that we didn't like other women getting into football, we wanted all the attention for ourselves ( Right To Reply 's loss, I think you'd agree). Then, disaster struck. </p> <p>Word came back from our contact at Gary's club fanzine, The Spur, that Gary didn't dig what we were doing, didn't realise in those pre-ladette times that we were pioneers (man), and deserved a little respect (goddamit) from the male beauty we were stalking. Asked about Ooh Gary, Gary! during an interview, he'd allegedly tut-tutted, sneered, and said: 'Oh, them.' </p> <p>Was this all the thanks we were going to get for our slavish devotion to England's foremost striker? For 'tut-tut' had we purchased every paper every day for six months in the hope of getting an elusive shot of Gary not standing near a goal mouth? For a sneer and an 'Oh, them ' had we bought Paul Gascoigne's expensive stupid book, and stood patiently in line for hours to get it signed, thereby giving us the opportunity to pass a copy of Ooh Gary, Gary! to Gascoigne and ask him to give it to Gary? ('We'll see he gets it', said Gazza's manager, tossing it into a bin seconds later.) </p> <p>It was a sobering moment, but also an instructive one. These days, I'm so 'over' Gary. I see him on TV presenting sport, team leading on They Think It's All Over, or advertising crisps, and I'm able to marvel at his easy charm and raffish good looks without feeling the slightest urge to kidnap him. That isn't to say my relationship with Gary ended totally without scar tissue, good and bad. It has left me with an abiding affection for men in shorts, as well as sympathy for those celebrity stalkers that get lambasted by the tabloids for scaring the bejesus out of casts of soap operas. There but for the grace of God... and all that. As Fiona pointed out at the time, while it is true that we didn't hang around outside the Tottenham ground waiting for Gary, it was only because there was a pub situated tantalisingly nearby. </p> <p>We also learned that some bubbles in life exist to be popped by reality. They say you should never meet your heroes, but maybe it's even more of a mistake not to meet them. Maybe if Gary had met Fiona and me, it would have given him the opportunity he needed not to ask us to marry him, and then we would have gone away, and he wouldn't have had to go 'tut tut' like that. Then again, at the end of the day, all things considered (etc), maybe we are all the better and wiser for the experience.

The Almeida's tenancy of the beautiful, derelict Gainsborough Studios has been presented as a Ralph Fiennes season. But it is Barbara Jefford - who first appeared in a Shakespeare play over 50 years ago - who causes the audience to be rapt. As the tyrant mother Volumnia - the person who taught Coriolanus how to bully - she uncoils herself to assume an easy grandeur of gesture. She is statuesque. She uses the verse like a knife. She subdues the vast space of this stage - just as she does her whimpering son. </p> <p>The Almeida are having an imaginative sojourn in Shoreditch. They have linked two of Shakespeare's least cajoling plays - Richard II and Coriolanus - and established a kinship between them. Both plays deal with men who are ill-equipped for power; both these men have rivals who can be seen as echoes. In both cases, these second selves have been played with admirable tautness by Linus Roache. And in both cases they have proved that Ralph Fiennes is a bold actor. </p> <p>Fiennes has made both his characters repellent. He might have been expected to be a melancholy, brooding Richard: instead, he was spiky. He might have been expected to smoulder as Coriolanus, but he plays him like a teenager trying out a series of different parts: he's in turn headstrong, petulant and scornful. He pretends to be a baby with silly walks and mocking voices - and then breaks down into real babyish tears. </p> <p>This intricate unpacking of a part - nearly always full-face to the audience as if this were his looking glass - is always intelligent, but better suited to the self-conscious, self-regarding Richard II than to Coriolanus. This is a play which has been seen as an argument for revolution and as an argument against it. It has no point of rest, no haven of sympathy. It snarls in all directions. Its lack of certainty can make it seem peculiarly modern. It doesn't seem so here. </p> <p>Too much of this production is smudged. The staging is full of big effects, some of them tremendous. In Paul Brown's design, the jagged lightning fissure which splits the rough brick wall at the back of the stage becomes filled with smoke; the glass floor of the stage turns blood-red after battle; a massive, rusty gate clangs down like a guillotine. But a lot of the verse can't be heard. A lot of it is bellowed. There's a miasma of muttering, and a roaring, sword-waving way of going on. The crowd is a weeny huddle of blokes energetically pretending to be poor people. Despite the flares of excitement which are sent up, it's a production which lacks a sense of an outside world and of political consequence. </p> <p>Why would anyone looking for a melodrama pick on a writer whose prose is made up of qualifications, reservations and ambiguities? It's perverse. But it's what Ruth and Augustus Goetz did when, in 1947, they turned Henry James's novel Washington Square into a play and retitled it, with giveaway crudeness, <strong> The Heiress</strong>. Now this work has been revived, and brought, creaking and crinolined, to the Lyttelton. </p> <p>The flavour of James's novel is in its complications and nuances. A homely, unsophisticated, prosperous young woman lives coweringly with a father who despises her. She falls for a fortune-seeker who makes her happy. Her father sees through the young man, protects his daughter from him, and in doing so exposes her to a lifetime of clear-sighted unhappiness. </p> <p>It's a novel in which bad motives are seen to have amiable consequences, and in which correct behaviour proceeds from contempt. It is penetrating about psycholog ical dependence. Such subtleties are banished here. Alan Howard plays the father with a fluting whimsy which sanitises his danger. As his interfering sister, Maggie Steed produces a range of fruity gurgles and wobbly gestures worthy of a pantomime dame. Most damagingly, Ben Porter plays the young man as a self-evident cad, so that there's little tension in the heroine's progress: for most of the play she looks like a dope; at the end of it, her sacrifice seems trivial. </p> <p>As the heroine, the gifted young actress Eve Best needs all her large resources of composure to stay afloat, clinging to a thankless part, in which moves from blank-faced glumness - her eyes meeting no one's and her arms held wide apart as if to balance her on a pair of invisible stilts - to a silent, bitter serenity. </p> <p>Gideon Davey's design is a lovely region of eau-de-nil and pale yellow which is warmed by a golden glow and, between scenes, raked by a chill white light.

      "body": "<p>He will receive a hero's welcome; that much is certain. There will be more marching, more throngs, more propaganda. And it will seem utterly familiar to him. Eli\u00e1n Gonzalez was five years old, and a casualty of the revolution, when he fled Cuba. He's six now and has become the revolution's pre-eminent icon. How confused he might be about that rests on what he can remember of his life before the escape, and what he can forget about the city of Miami.</p> <p>Though a great deal of his story remains a mystery, we do know his voyage from Cuba to Miami. Late last November, Eli\u00e1n departed, quietly and secretly, with his mother, her boyfriend, his family and a few friends, headed for Florida. It was a desperate act. Their boat was too small - and with 14 people on board, overloaded. A faulty outboard motor required one stopover and more ruinous efforts to repair it, but was soon on the blink again. The boat capsized during a brutal squall off the Florida coast. Three inner tubes were all they had for an emergency; now here it was, crashing upon them. They held on and drifted feebly in the powerful swells. At one point, the lights of Miami shimmered in the horizon. It was too late for heroics; the current pulled them back and, one by one, they let go. Eleven died. On Thanksgiving Day, Eli\u00e1n was discovered floating alone near Fort Lauderdale (two others were rescued further south). Strangely, he didn't require hospitalisation. How long he'd braved the waters is anyone's guess. He couldn't remember. Some say 50 hours.</p> <p>Eli\u00e1n had lost his mother. He'd watched her drown. His father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, remained in Cuba, along with the rest of his immediate family. Yet there were more traumas lying in store. His extraordinary survival had, unbeknown to him, sliced open an old wound between two parallel worlds, one in Havana, another in Miami; between native Cubans and exiled Cubans, between the branch of Eli\u00e1n's family in Cuba and another he'd never met in the US. For five surreal months, the saga of Eli\u00e1n rekindled Cold War vigils and terrors on a vast political scale. Somewhere in that senseless battlefield, his welfare was laid bare.</p> <p>It was never a simple custody matter. It wasn't even an immigration dispute. From the start, it was a war of competing ideolo gies and prejudices, and they were out in force. There was jubilation in Havana on Easter Saturday, the day Eli\u00e1n was whisked away from his Miami relatives at gunpoint and delivered to his father in Washington, DC - and destruction on the streets of Miami, where more than 100 fires were ignited. A week later, 80,000 marched in protest through the neighbourhood known as 'Little Havana', this time without violence. Women were asked to wear black, which, despite the sweltering heat, they did in large numbers. Some carried effigies of Eli\u00e1n, others raised billboard-sized banners displaying a familiar red-white-and-blue striped motif: the flag of Cuba. The American flag was also unfurled - upside down.</p> <p>Miami had splintered. A few miles away, another 3,000-strong 'pro-American' demonstration offered a sight rarely witnessed there before: blacks marching alongside whites - the whites brandishing Confederate flags. Some of the protestors held Bibles up to the sky. Hatred and anger were visible everywhere.</p> <p>In Cuba, meanwhile, Fidel Castro launched the biggest public-relations blitz since he arrived in Havana as conqueror in 1959. It was a political opportunity not to be missed. If Castro lost, the court of world public opinion would surely endorse his standing on the boy's right to be with his father. If he won, the resulting two-fingered salute to the yanquis - and, more crucially, to the Cuban-exile community in Miami - would pay handsome dividends on the street. Earlier this month, on the day after the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta denied the Miami-based Gonzalez family's appeal for an asylum hearing, 500,000 women marched in Havana, a city whose entire population is just 2 million. The protest was against Eli\u00e1n observing the court order to remain in the US for 14 days while the Miami clan filed another appeal, possibly with the Supreme Court.</p> <p>Miami is unlike any other city. American only in name, it's a city of racial rancours and political grudges. More significantly, it is a city of exiles - from Haiti, El Salvador, Panama, Nicaragua, Argentina, Colombia. The largest, most powerful group is Cuban. According to the US Census Bureau, Hispanics make up 12 per cent of the United States population. Cubans constitute a small minority of those, a meagre six per cent. In Florida's Dade County, Cubans constitute 40 per cent of the population - a large, successful, noisy majority. Alone, they make up 55 per cent of Miami.</p> <p>After Fidel Castro swept into power, the exodus to Florida began. The regime that keeps him happily in Havana keeps the exiles furious in Miami. Some saw Miami as un pueblo de campo (an outback village) when they arrived, but no longer. Today, with its big urban skyline and financial gateway to Latin America, Miami is a bedrock, conducted largely en espa\u00f1ol , by Cubans. Often in defiance of reason, their dream - a return to the promised land - perseveres.</p> <p>For these Cubans came to fight Castro, not build a city. The metropolis evolved as years dragged on, along with an ambivalence to America's government and culture. The maladroit Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 was the first breach, followed by the missile crisis in 1962. Throughout the 60s and early 70s, exile parents found the prospect of their sons being drafted to Vietnam difficult to reconcile with watching Marxist Cuba being allowed to continue only 90 miles from Florida. Subsequent US interventions in Chile, Grenada and Panama have added to the disenchantment. Life in Havana permeates every aspect of life in Miami, a phenomenon by turns understandable, peculiar, outrageous and, occasionally, embarrassing.</p> <p>The Eli\u00e1n political spectacle has uncaged circus animals of every stripe. One recent example from the menagerie of local politics: Miami has a Cuban-American mayor. His name is Joe Carollo, though lately he has been going by 'Crazy Joe' Carollo. During the protests leading up to the Easter raid - amid the clamour for solidarity within this largest voting portion - the mayor went on Spanish-language radio stations, local news shows, even on CNN, to warn that his police department would not assist federal law-enforcement officials if they came after the boy. They did - and afterwards he went on a televised sacking spree. His first volley was to eject the well-regarded (non-Hispanic) chief of police, on the grounds that he knew about the raid and neglected to inform him. The city's non-Hispanic city manager refused to unseat the police chief - who resigned anyway. The mayor dismissed the city manager. Now Miami has a Cuban mayor, a Cuban city manager, a Cuban chief of police, a Cuban city attorney, and a Cuban majority in the commission. The city, meanwhile, is more divided than ever. As the Eli\u00e1n affair turned the spotlight on the exile community, the latter has responded less like the old guard and more like a marginalised fundamentalist fringe. There's no small amount of paranoia, plus a dose of the sheer lunacy for which Miami is famous.</p> <p>An insult lives many lives here. After the mayor's antics were compared to the shenanigans of a banana-republic politico, a banana war was declared, no one knows by whom - a war which is still being waged by sides equally keen to claim the fruit as their emblem. Someone drew a circle of bananas around Miami's seal and left it outside City Hall. Bananas were hurled near the entrance on a daily basis. More recent protests have produced bananas as symbols of defiance and solidarity: opponents of the mayor point the banana down; supporters point it up. No fatalities have been reported.</p> <p>A banana flag already exists. Designed by Barbara Dabney and manufactured at her 'Freedom Flag and Banner' plant in Miami, it has been a runaway success. The flag features a redesigned city seal - citing the founding date of the republic as the year 2000 - arranged over a field of bananas. Dabney's business has flourished in recent times; from April through May, thousands of Cuban and US flags have been ordered for protesters on opposite sides of the barricade. For all the ranting, few entrepreneurs have thought twice about cashing in on Eli\u00e1n. And not merely on 'Free Eli\u00e1n' buttons and T-shirts sanctifying his image. No, 'real sand' from the Cuban Gonzalez family hometown of C\u00e1rdenas. Little Havana 'holy water' fresh from a tap near the Miami Gonzalez home. Eli\u00e1n's cup. Eli\u00e1n's tennis ball. Eli\u00e1n's hair. The online shopping mall eBay has listed upwards of 134 items, from Eli\u00e1n rosaries to pray for the boy ($59) to more preposterous articles: a picture painted on a license plate of Eli\u00e1n urinating on Fidel Castro ($4.99); the very raft used by the boy at sea (bids scaled to $10 million), though this item was pulled when it suddenly dawned on prospective buyers that Eli\u00e1n had been clinging to an inner tube, not a raft.</p> <p>The internet war has been extreme. Janet Reno perhaps expected to retire to her hometown of Miami after her time as attorney general. She may want to review her plans. The electronic postcards I received from Miami speak for themselves: one is a variant on the famous Associated Press photograph taken on the day of the seizure. Eli\u00e1n is crying, but not because he's facing a submachine gun - instead, Reno has burst through the door and flashed her breasts. In another there's no Eli\u00e1n this time, simply Reno superimposed upon a pornographic picture of a pre-operation transsexual.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, Bill Clinton has also been ushered onstage for comic relief. The AP photograph of the raid has the president pushing through the door, smiling, with rifle in hand, while Fidel Castro, in battle fatigues, follows in behind him. T-shirts with this picture are for sale all over Little Havana - the caption reads: 'Federal Child Abuse'. Porn isn't the only exile weapon on the web. The site <a href=\"http://www.nocastro.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.nocastro.com</a> offers propaganda plus a trip down memory lane. We are reminded in an Amnesty International summary that, as recently as 1994, Castro ordered the sinking of the tugboat 13 de Mayo leaving for Miami, in which 35 men, women and children perished. Cuban exiles understand the situation in Cuba completely. It's a matter of record that the Cuban republic claims a child belongs to the state, not its father, and a matter of policy that children constitute a goodly portion of the Cuban labour force.</p> <p>'The Eli\u00e1n phenomenon is like a virus,' says Jim Mullin, editor of the Miami newspaper New Times , 'everything it touches gets infected.' This statement could easily apply to Cuba and the entire exile theme. One of the editors I worked with during my eight years in Miami, Mullin came from California in 1988 and still remains baffled by the exiles. 'For a journalist this is hog heaven. It's fascinating trying to figure this place out. I've been trying for 12 years.' Will he stay in Miami? 'I'll stay until Castro falls and Cuba is restored.' He could be waiting a long while yet.</p> <p>Waiting for Fidel is a story that's decades old. It is my family's story and, to a lesser degree, my own. My exile began before I was born. Conceived in Cuba in 1958, I was delivered in Florida in 1959, eight months after Castro received his own hero's welcome. My heritage has been a meandering rootlessness. Some members of my family came immediately, some stayed and came later, some stayed indefinitely. Less a political upheaval than an illustration of families split down the middle, the circumstances of my family's path in Cuba were typical. My great-grandfather, General Emilio Nu\u00f1ez, was a hero of the revolution that ended the Spanish-American War in 1898 and founded the Cuban republic. A devoted friend of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, Cuba's greatest poet, the general was chosen to introduce and raise the Cuban flag at the Morro Castle when independence was declared; later he served as vice-president.</p> <p>My grandfather, Emilio Nu\u00f1ez Portuondo, was a well-known politician and diplomat. In the 50s, he became a leading anti-communist at the United Nations, where he headed the Security Council. No supporter of Batista, he nonetheless represented him at the UN. His final political act was to resign the post of prime minister after serving barely 10 days, when Batista expressed his intention to withdraw constitutional guarantees. 'It's the beginning of the end,' he told my mother.</p> <p>Much to my grandfather's dismay, his eldest son had fallen in love with Myrta Diaz-Balart, a young divorcee, and they were married. Her former husband was Fidel Castro. She remains the only woman El M\u00e1ximo has ever married. The marriage also produced a son, Fidel Jr, the only one from Castro's unofficial brood of 11 to be deemed 'legitimate'. Conflicts of interest, political and personal, coincided with a revolution. When it came, there was ample reason to leave. The scene in Miami was characteristic: fistfights at the airport broke out between fidelistas headed to Havana and batistianos fleeing Cuba. The televised executions during January and February 1959, when enemies were led to the pared\u00f3n and shot, made for grisly viewing - especially for my grandparents, who could easily imagine a similar march. Their Cuban days were over.</p> <p>My father was 22 at that time. In the affluent climate of 50s Cuba, he was already going places. He had secured a loan of $5 million from a Canadian bank in order to develop a casino and hotel resort within family-owned land in the province of Pinar del Rio. Things changed after Castro. Now he had a wife, three children and no job, in a foreign country. His early exile was a time of desperate moves, some towards a career and others to restore Cuba. For a time, he received soldiers of fortune in our little house in Fort Lauderdale, and played a small part in plots to put away Fidel. An explosive device supposedly to be flown and dropped over Castro at a rally was kept for a while in our bathroom. The pilot lost his nerve, the plot fizzled, and the device was disassembled. My father succeeded in business later on, but the loss of Cuba was a sadness he carried within, until to the end of his life.</p> <p>My aunt Myrta eventually left Cuba and moved to Spain. She was never denied access to Fidelito, but had to travel great distances to see him. Fidelito trained in the Soviet Union as a nuclear physicist. Not unlike Eli\u00e1n, he was a state trophy. He has led an obscure life back in Cuba and is said to be close to Fidel now, and has been spotted in recent protests standing beside his father. I have never met Fidelito, nor any others from Castro's side of the family. Fidelito's cousins include Florida state senator Mario Diaz-Balart and US congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart, both vehemently anti-Castro - marking yet another split in one family.</p> <p>Metaphors common and strange have pelted down on Eli\u00e1n's fragile bones like hail - a miracle, an angel, a martyr, a saviour. There have been visions of sacred dolphins and a weeping Virgin Mary. Hosannas have been offered to the 'fisherman' who 'rescued' Eli\u00e1n. Everyone wants to provide a segment of the hagiography. Even the Spanish-speaking world's best-known novelists have weighed in, from Peru's Mario Vargas Llosa to Chile's Ariel Dorfman to Colombia's (or, these days, Mexico's) Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez; the greatest living Cuban writer, Guillermo Cabrera Infante, who lives in London, published an article drawing a parallel between Eli\u00e1n and the Yoruba deity, Elegu\u00e1, to underscore his eternal place in Cuban folklore. The act of consecration is always peculiar, whether it takes place in Little Miami or Kensington Palace.</p> <p>But the featured players of The Eli\u00e1n Show are all too human, starting with the Miami Gonzalezes. Ah, the character issue: in pursuit of their custody suit, they were quick to sling mud, but might have looked closer to home first. Great-uncles L\u00e1zaro and Delfin Gonzalez, at the forefront of the custody war, share drunk-driving convictions. Eli\u00e1n's cousin, Marisleysis - who, bidding for the part of surrogate mother of a saint, wept buckets after the raid, and then delivered an attack on Janet Reno's sexuality - has been hospitalised some eight times since November, citing 'stress'. L\u00e1zaro and Delfin's twin nephews, Jos\u00e9 and Luis Cid, photographed playing with the boy soon after his rescue, would have raised the eyebrows of any judge deciding on custody: Jos\u00e9 has a criminal record for grand theft, forgery and violating probation. Luis was arrested for allegedly robbing a tourist in Little Havana. And amid the screeching over Cuba's brainwashing machinery, which member of the household was responsible for the 40-second video, shot at 1am, showing an exhausted Eli\u00e1n telling his father he wanted to stay in Miami?</p> <p>It shouldn't come as a surprise that 'the fisherman' - el pescador - who 'saved' Eli\u00e1n is not a saint, let alone a St Peter. Donato Dalrymple, a house cleaner, was on his first fishing trip with his cousin when he laid eyes on Eli\u00e1n. The cousin was actually the one who lifted Eli\u00e1n from the inner tube. Of Donato's three failed marriages, two have been to brides of the mail-order variety. He has no children and says he doesn't want any. Dalrymple's brother, Lindy, is in prison for beating his son, not quite four years old, to death. Donato defends his sibling, 'the kindest person' he has ever known, with the same fervency he lavishes upon his love for the 'miracle child'. It was Dalrymple who was clutching Eli\u00e1n in the AP photograph. El pescador, who insists on calling himself 'saviour', first filed a suit seeking to remove L\u00e1zaro Gonzalez as custodian, a moot point after Eli\u00e1n's transfer to Washington. Then he filed a $100 million suit against Janet Reno for depriving him of his civil rights during the raid. A few days ago he touted his new celebrity on the ABC programme Politically Incorrect. Immortality will doubtless follow on Trivial Pursuit.</p> <p>Exile madness extends to more honourable professions and even to non-Hispanics. Kendall Coffey, the attorney leading the Miami Gonzalez defence team, is no stranger to scandal. After losing a bid for office in 1992, he was appointed to replace Janet Reno as federal prosecutor. There, Coffey lost a landmark case against a pair of alleged drug smugglers who were accused of importing 75 tons of cocaine, worth roughly $2 billion. It was the biggest drug-trafficking trial ever lost by federal prosecutors.</p> <p>Understandably feeling a bit down, Coffey didn't leave home without his American Express card on the evening in February 1996, when he drove to Lipstik, a nude strip bar. He ordered a magnum of Dom P\u00e9rignon and charged it before sitting down for a private nude-dancing 'session' with stripper Tamara 'Tiffany' Gutierrez. She had good cause to complain when the tip came in the form of Coffey lunging at her breast in a huff and settling for her arm, which he promptly bit. He was escorted out of the premises. Later that night, Coffey's father tried to destroy the credit-card slip and offered cash, but the story was out. Coffey fils resigned soon afterwards.</p> <p>Fear has fuelled a history of exile violence that no amount of whitewashing can unstain. Occasionally it has highlighted inadequacies among Miami's elected officials when dealing with fringe terrorism. Between 1974 and 1994, 10 bombs were deposited at the office of Spanish-language magazine R\u00e9plica, for simply advocating a 'dialogue' with Castro. Between 1980 and 2000, stores shipping packages to Cuba have been bombed, travel agencies arranging travel to Cuba have been bombed, businesses shipping medical supplies to Cuba have been bombed. Many refuse to own up to the mantle of extremism: 'Some people in the community haven't wanted to face up to a history of violence,' says Enrique Fernandez. A Cuban journalist writing in English, Fernandez is a rarity in Florida journalism. His weekly column for Fort Lauderdale's newspaper, the Sun-Sentinel , has sought to accept things for what they are. The politicians, he wrote recently, are vexing but soon pass. Where the larger culture is concerned, viva la diferencia</p> <p>His rationale for Miami's irreconcilable differences is simply: 'History. This has never been a decent place. It was a gangster hangout in the 20s when there was gambling. It was a den of racist Jim Crow laws in the 50s. The exiles came and history has persisted. That's no surprise.' Fernandez doesn't agree with the theory that too much time has elapsed for Miami Cubans to consider repatriation. He doesn't even like the term 'Cuban-American': 'Being Cuban is something you feel; it's something you can't readily explain - a spirit that's simply there. However different each person's relationship to Cuba may be, I think people here see themselves first as Cubans and secondly as Americans.' More disturbing, perhaps, is how Americans see them. Based on recent polls, the Cuban-exile community, until recently a respected minority with considerable clout inside Washington, appears to have shed some of its good regard and political capital fighting the Eli\u00e1n war.</p> <p>Nine US presidents down and counting, Fidel Castro is alive and well. The tragic flotilla of rafts continues across the waters. In Miami, the streets are suddenly quiet with the air of resignation. Crazy Joe Carollo is up for re-election in November 2001; bananas may well be licensed weapons by then. The Miami Gonzalezes are moving away from Little Havana. Some have suggested making their former rented home a museum; the landlord is weighing up the numbers. Three Eli\u00e1n movies are currently in production, one of them, produced by notorious low-budget shlockmeister Menahem Golan, is being filmed in Cuba. In a move by congressmen from the farm states of the American midwest, there is now serious talk about ending the Cuban embargo. Eli\u00e1n Gonzalez works in mysterious ways.</p> <p><b>More on observer.co.uk</b></p> <p><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/cuba\">Cuba after Castro - Observer special</a><br></p> <p><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/life\">Observer Life</a><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "He will receive a hero's welcome; that much is certain. There will be more marching, more throngs, more propaganda. And it will seem utterly familiar to him. Eli\u00e1n Gonzalez was five years old, and a casualty of the revolution, when he fled Cuba. He's six now and has become the revolution's pre-eminent icon. How confused he might be about that rests on what he can remember of his life before the escape, and what he can forget about the city of Miami. Though a great deal of his story remains a mystery, we do know his voyage from Cuba to Miami. Late last November, Eli\u00e1n departed, quietly and secretly, with his mother, her boyfriend, his family and a few friends, headed for Florida. It was a desperate act. Their boat was too small - and with 14 people on board, overloaded. A faulty outboard motor required one stopover and more ruinous efforts to repair it, but was soon on the blink again. The boat capsized during a brutal squall off the Florida coast. Three inner tubes were all they had for an emergency; now here it was, crashing upon them. They held on and drifted feebly in the powerful swells. At one point, the lights of Miami shimmered in the horizon. It was too late for heroics; the current pulled them back and, one by one, they let go. Eleven died. On Thanksgiving Day, Eli\u00e1n was discovered floating alone near Fort Lauderdale (two others were rescued further south). Strangely, he didn't require hospitalisation. How long he'd braved the waters is anyone's guess. He couldn't remember. Some say 50 hours. Eli\u00e1n had lost his mother. He'd watched her drown. His father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, remained in Cuba, along with the rest of his immediate family. Yet there were more traumas lying in store. His extraordinary survival had, unbeknown to him, sliced open an old wound between two parallel worlds, one in Havana, another in Miami; between native Cubans and exiled Cubans, between the branch of Eli\u00e1n's family in Cuba and another he'd never met in the US. For five surreal months, the saga of Eli\u00e1n rekindled Cold War vigils and terrors on a vast political scale. Somewhere in that senseless battlefield, his welfare was laid bare. It was never a simple custody matter. It wasn't even an immigration dispute. From the start, it was a war of competing ideolo gies and prejudices, and they were out in force. There was jubilation in Havana on Easter Saturday, the day Eli\u00e1n was whisked away from his Miami relatives at gunpoint and delivered to his father in Washington, DC - and destruction on the streets of Miami, where more than 100 fires were ignited. A week later, 80,000 marched in protest through the neighbourhood known as 'Little Havana', this time without violence. Women were asked to wear black, which, despite the sweltering heat, they did in large numbers. Some carried effigies of Eli\u00e1n, others raised billboard-sized banners displaying a familiar red-white-and-blue striped motif: the flag of Cuba. The American flag was also unfurled - upside down. Miami had splintered. A few miles away, another 3,000-strong 'pro-American' demonstration offered a sight rarely witnessed there before: blacks marching alongside whites - the whites brandishing Confederate flags. Some of the protestors held Bibles up to the sky. Hatred and anger were visible everywhere. In Cuba, meanwhile, Fidel Castro launched the biggest public-relations blitz since he arrived in Havana as conqueror in 1959. It was a political opportunity not to be missed. If Castro lost, the court of world public opinion would surely endorse his standing on the boy's right to be with his father. If he won, the resulting two-fingered salute to the yanquis - and, more crucially, to the Cuban-exile community in Miami - would pay handsome dividends on the street. Earlier this month, on the day after the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta denied the Miami-based Gonzalez family's appeal for an asylum hearing, 500,000 women marched in Havana, a city whose entire population is just 2 million. The protest was against Eli\u00e1n observing the court order to remain in the US for 14 days while the Miami clan filed another appeal, possibly with the Supreme Court. Miami is unlike any other city. American only in name, it's a city of racial rancours and political grudges. More significantly, it is a city of exiles - from Haiti, El Salvador, Panama, Nicaragua, Argentina, Colombia. The largest, most powerful group is Cuban. According to the US Census Bureau, Hispanics make up 12 per cent of the United States population. Cubans constitute a small minority of those, a meagre six per cent. In Florida's Dade County, Cubans constitute 40 per cent of the population - a large, successful, noisy majority. Alone, they make up 55 per cent of Miami. After Fidel Castro swept into power, the exodus to Florida began. The regime that keeps him happily in Havana keeps the exiles furious in Miami. Some saw Miami as un pueblo de campo (an outback village) when they arrived, but no longer. Today, with its big urban skyline and financial gateway to Latin America, Miami is a bedrock, conducted largely en espa\u00f1ol , by Cubans. Often in defiance of reason, their dream - a return to the promised land - perseveres. For these Cubans came to fight Castro, not build a city. The metropolis evolved as years dragged on, along with an ambivalence to America's government and culture. The maladroit Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 was the first breach, followed by the missile crisis in 1962. Throughout the 60s and early 70s, exile parents found the prospect of their sons being drafted to Vietnam difficult to reconcile with watching Marxist Cuba being allowed to continue only 90 miles from Florida. Subsequent US interventions in Chile, Grenada and Panama have added to the disenchantment. Life in Havana permeates every aspect of life in Miami, a phenomenon by turns understandable, peculiar, outrageous and, occasionally, embarrassing. The Eli\u00e1n political spectacle has uncaged circus animals of every stripe. One recent example from the menagerie of local politics: Miami has a Cuban-American mayor. His name is Joe Carollo, though lately he has been going by 'Crazy Joe' Carollo. During the protests leading up to the Easter raid - amid the clamour for solidarity within this largest voting portion - the mayor went on Spanish-language radio stations, local news shows, even on CNN, to warn that his police department would not assist federal law-enforcement officials if they came after the boy. They did - and afterwards he went on a televised sacking spree. His first volley was to eject the well-regarded (non-Hispanic) chief of police, on the grounds that he knew about the raid and neglected to inform him. The city's non-Hispanic city manager refused to unseat the police chief - who resigned anyway. The mayor dismissed the city manager. Now Miami has a Cuban mayor, a Cuban city manager, a Cuban chief of police, a Cuban city attorney, and a Cuban majority in the commission. The city, meanwhile, is more divided than ever. As the Eli\u00e1n affair turned the spotlight on the exile community, the latter has responded less like the old guard and more like a marginalised fundamentalist fringe. There's no small amount of paranoia, plus a dose of the sheer lunacy for which Miami is famous. An insult lives many lives here. After the mayor's antics were compared to the shenanigans of a banana-republic politico, a banana war was declared, no one knows by whom - a war which is still being waged by sides equally keen to claim the fruit as their emblem. Someone drew a circle of bananas around Miami's seal and left it outside City Hall. Bananas were hurled near the entrance on a daily basis. More recent protests have produced bananas as symbols of defiance and solidarity: opponents of the mayor point the banana down; supporters point it up. No fatalities have been reported.

No, 'real sand' from the Cuban Gonzalez family hometown of C\u00e1rdenas. Little Havana 'holy water' fresh from a tap near the Miami Gonzalez home. Eli\u00e1n's cup. Eli\u00e1n's tennis ball.

The online shopping mall eBay has listed upwards of 134 items, from Eli\u00e1n rosaries to pray for the boy ($59) to more preposterous articles: a picture painted on a license plate of Eli\u00e1n urinating on Fidel Castro ($4.99); the very raft used by the boy at sea (bids scaled to $10 million), though this item was pulled when it suddenly dawned on prospective buyers that Eli\u00e1n had been clinging to an inner tube, not a raft. The internet war has been extreme. Janet Reno perhaps expected to retire to her hometown of Miami after her time as attorney general. She may want to review her plans. The electronic postcards I received from Miami speak for themselves: one is a variant on the famous Associated Press photograph taken on the day of the seizure. Eli\u00e1n is crying, but not because he's facing a submachine gun - instead, Reno has burst through the door and flashed her breasts. In another there's no Eli\u00e1n this time, simply Reno superimposed upon a pornographic picture of a pre-operation transsexual. Not surprisingly, Bill Clinton has also been ushered onstage for comic relief. The AP photograph of the raid has the president pushing through the door, smiling, with rifle in hand, while Fidel Castro, in battle fatigues, follows in behind him.

Metaphors common and strange have pelted down on Eli\u00e1n's fragile bones like hail - a miracle, an angel, a martyr, a saviour. There have been visions of sacred dolphins and a weeping Virgin Mary. Hosannas have been offered to the 'fisherman' who 'rescued' Eli\u00e1n. Everyone wants to provide a segment of the hagiography. Even the Spanish-speaking world's best-known novelists have weighed in, from Peru's Mario Vargas Llosa to Chile's Ariel Dorfman to Colombia's (or, these days, Mexico's) Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez; the greatest living Cuban writer, Guillermo Cabrera Infante, who lives in London, published an article drawing a parallel between Eli\u00e1n and the Yoruba deity, Elegu\u00e1, to underscore his eternal place in Cuban folklore. The act of consecration is always peculiar, whether it takes place in Little Miami or Kensington Palace. But the featured players of The Eli\u00e1n Show are all too human, starting with the Miami Gonzalezes. Ah, the character issue: in pursuit of their custody suit, they were quick to sling mud, but might have looked closer to home first. Great-uncles L\u00e1zaro and Delfin Gonzalez, at the forefront of the custody war, share drunk-driving convictions. Eli\u00e1n's cousin, Marisleysis - who, bidding for the part of surrogate mother of a saint, wept buckets after the raid, and then delivered an attack on Janet Reno's sexuality - has been hospitalised some eight times since November, citing 'stress'. L\u00e1zaro and Delfin's twin nephews, Jos\u00e9 and Luis Cid, photographed playing with the boy soon after his rescue, would have raised the eyebrows of any judge deciding on custody: Jos\u00e9 has a criminal record for grand theft, forgery and violating probation. Luis was arrested for allegedly robbing a tourist in Little Havana. And amid the screeching over Cuba's brainwashing machinery, which member of the household was responsible for the 40-second video, shot at 1am, showing an exhausted Eli\u00e1n telling his father he wanted to stay in Miami? It shouldn't come as a surprise that 'the fisherman' - el pescador - who 'saved' Eli\u00e1n is not a saint, let alone a St Peter. Donato Dalrymple, a house cleaner, was on his first fishing trip with his cousin when he laid eyes on Eli\u00e1n. The cousin was actually the one who lifted Eli\u00e1n from the inner tube. Of Donato's three failed marriages, two have been to brides of the mail-order variety. He has no children and says he doesn't want any. Dalrymple's brother, Lindy, is in prison for beating his son, not quite four years old, to death. Donato defends his sibling, 'the kindest person' he has ever known, with the same fervency he lavishes upon his love for the 'miracle child'. It was Dalrymple who was clutching Eli\u00e1n in the AP photograph. El pescador, who insists on calling himself 'saviour', first filed a suit seeking to remove L\u00e1zaro Gonzalez as custodian, a moot point after Eli\u00e1n's transfer to Washington. Then he filed a $100 million suit against Janet Reno for depriving him of his civil rights during the raid. A few days ago he touted his new celebrity on the ABC programme Politically Incorrect. Immortality will doubtless follow on Trivial Pursuit. Exile madness extends to more honourable professions and even to non-Hispanics. Kendall Coffey, the attorney leading the Miami Gonzalez defence team, is no stranger to scandal. After losing a bid for office in 1992, he was appointed to replace Janet Reno as federal prosecutor. There, Coffey lost a landmark case against a pair of alleged drug smugglers who were accused of importing 75 tons of cocaine, worth roughly $2 billion. It was the biggest drug-trafficking trial ever lost by federal prosecutors. Understandably feeling a bit down, Coffey didn't leave home without his American Express card on the evening in February 1996, when he drove to Lipstik, a nude strip bar. He ordered a magnum of Dom P\u00e9rignon and charged it before sitting down for a private nude-dancing 'session' with stripper Tamara 'Tiffany' Gutierrez. She had good cause to complain when the tip came in the form of Coffey lunging at her breast in a huff and settling for her arm, which he promptly bit. He was escorted out of the premises. Later that night, Coffey's father tried to destroy the credit-card slip and offered cash, but the story was out. Coffey fils resigned soon afterwards. Fear has fuelled a history of exile violence that no amount of whitewashing can unstain. Occasionally it has highlighted inadequacies among Miami's elected officials when dealing with fringe terrorism. Between 1974 and 1994, 10 bombs were deposited at the office of Spanish-language magazine R\u00e9plica, for simply advocating a 'dialogue' with Castro. Between 1980 and 2000, stores shipping packages to Cuba have been bombed, travel agencies arranging travel to Cuba have been bombed, businesses shipping medical supplies to Cuba have been bombed. Many refuse to own up to the mantle of extremism: 'Some people in the community haven't wanted to face up to a history of violence,' says Enrique Fernandez. A Cuban journalist writing in English, Fernandez is a rarity in Florida journalism. His weekly column for Fort Lauderdale's newspaper, the Sun-Sentinel , has sought to accept things for what they are. The politicians, he wrote recently, are vexing but soon pass. Where the larger culture is concerned, viva la diferencia His rationale for Miami's irreconcilable differences is simply: 'History. This has never been a decent place. It was a gangster hangout in the 20s when there was gambling. It was a den of racist Jim Crow laws in the 50s. The exiles came and history has persisted. That's no surprise.' Fernandez doesn't agree with the theory that too much time has elapsed for Miami Cubans to consider repatriation. He doesn't even like the term 'Cuban-American': 'Being Cuban is something you feel; it's something you can't readily explain - a spirit that's simply there. However different each person's relationship to Cuba may be, I think people here see themselves first as Cubans and secondly as Americans.' More disturbing, perhaps, is how Americans see them. Based on recent polls, the Cuban-exile community, until recently a respected minority with considerable clout inside Washington, appears to have shed some of its good regard and political capital fighting the Eli\u00e1n war. Nine US presidents down and counting, Fidel Castro is alive and well. The tragic flotilla of rafts continues across the waters. In Miami, the streets are suddenly quiet with the air of resignation. Crazy Joe Carollo is up for re-election in November 2001; bananas may well be licensed weapons by then. The Miami Gonzalezes are moving away from Little Havana. Some have suggested making their former rented home a museum; the landlord is weighing up the numbers. Three Eli\u00e1n movies are currently in production, one of them, produced by notorious low-budget shlockmeister Menahem Golan, is being filmed in Cuba. In a move by congressmen from the farm states of the American midwest, there is now serious talk about ending the Cuban embargo. Eli\u00e1n Gonzalez works in mysterious ways.
